'''''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome''''' is a reference work written by [[Samuel Ball Platner]] and completed by [[Thomas Ashby]] after Platner's death that was published in 1929 by Oxford University Press.&lt;ref name="Platner2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Ball Platner|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVsdngEACAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Oxbow|isbn=978-0-19-925649-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as 'Platner and Ashby', the volume describes the ancient monuments and buildings in the city of [[Rome]], although by and large only if they belong to the [[ancient Rome|classical period]].&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; It covers both remains that are still extant and buildings of which not a trace remains, and collates source documents for each. This volume was, for fifty or sixty years, the standard reference in the field of [[Topography of ancient Rome|Roman topography]], having superseded [[Rodolfo Lanciani]]'s ''Forma Urbis''. Platner and Ashby has since itself been superseded by a reworking, L.&amp;nbsp;Richardson,&amp;nbsp;Jr.'s ''A&amp;nbsp;New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'',&lt;ref name="jr1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=L.

==Albania (Balkans)==
{{Further information|Names of the Albanians and Albania}}

[[Albania]] is the name of a country in the [[Balkans]], attested in [[Medieval Latin]]. The name has derived from the [[Illyrian tribe]] of the ''[[Albanoi]]'' and their center [[Albanopolis]], noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, [[Ptolemy]], in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Lloshi 1999, p. 277. "The Albanians of today call themselves shqiptarë, their country Shqipëri, and their language shqipe. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them albanesi (Italian), Albaner (German), Albanians (English), Alvanos (Greek), and Arbanasi (old Serbian), the country Albania, Albanie, Albanien, Alvania, and Albanija, and the language Albanese, Albanisch, Albanian, Alvaniki, and Arbanashki respectively. All these words are derived from the name Albanoi of an Illyrian tribe and their center Albanopolis, noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. Alban could he a plural of alb- arb-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm 1998, p. 29. "Nor is there any mystery about the origin of this name. In the second century Ptolemy referred to a tribe called the 'Albanoi', and located their town, 'Albanopolis', somewhere to the east of Durres."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mëniku &amp; Campos 2012, p. 2. "Albanian is an Indo-European language, but like modern Greek and Armenian, it does not have any other closely related living language. Within the Indo-European family, it forms a group of its own. In Albanian, the language is called shqip. Albania is called Shqipëri, and the Albanians call themselves shqiptarë. Until the fifteenth century the language was known as Arbërisht or Arbnisht, which is still the name used for the language in Italy and Greece. The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika. In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name Albanoi to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as Arbanori or Albanon. It is clear that the words Arbëresh, Arvanitika, and even Albanian and Albania are all related to the older name of the language."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan Marmullaku - 1975, ''Albania and the Albanians'' - Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;
Linguists think that the element ''*alb-'' in the root word, is an Indo-European term for a type of mountainous topography, meaning "hill, mountain", also present in ''[[Alps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm 1998, p. 29. "Linguists believe that the ‘Alb-’ element comes from the Indo-European word for a type of mountainous terrain, from which the word ‘Alps’ is also derived."&lt;/ref&gt;
Through the root word ''alban'' and its [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacized]] equivalents ''arban'', ''albar'', and ''arbar'', the term appears as the ethnonym of [[Albanians]] in [[Medieval Greek]] documents as ''Albanoi'' and ''Arbanitai'', and in Medieval Latin as ''Albanenses'' and ''Arbanenses'', gradually entering in other European languages.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie, Robert (2005). Albanian literature: A short history. London: I.B. Tauris. pp. 3–4. "Their traditional designation, based on a root *alban- and its rhotacized variants *arban-, *albar-, and *arbar-, appears from the eleventh century onwards in Byzantine chronicles (Albanoi, Arbanitai, Arbanites), and from the fourteenth century onwards in Latin and other Western documents (Albanenses, Arbanenses)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel. "Kosovo, a short history". London: Macmillan, 1998, p. 22–40 "The name used in all these references is, allowing for linguistic variations, the same: 'Albanenses' or 'Arbanenses' in Latin, 'Albanoi' or 'Arbanitai' in Byzantine Greek. (The last of these, with an internal switching of consonants, gave rise to the Turkish form 'Arnavud', from which 'Arnaut' was later derived.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arbon===
The toponym ''Arbon''  ({{lang-el|Ἄρβων or Ἀρβών}}) &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k2ILAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Polybius+arbon&amp;hl=el&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=arbon&amp;f=false The general history of Polybius, Tome 1],"and escaped to Arbon"&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Arbo''&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, Histories, 2.11, "Of the Illyrian troops engaged in blockading Issa, those that belonged to Pharos were left unharmed, as a favour to Demetrius; while all the rest scattered and fled to Arbo"&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang-el|Άρβωνα}}'')&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, Histories, 2.11, "είς τόν Άρβωνα σκεδασθέντες"&lt;/ref&gt; is mentioned by [[Polybius]] in the ''History of the World'' (2nd century BC). It was perhaps an island&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, Geography H.C. Hamilton, Esq., W. Falconer, M.A., Ed,"The Libyrnides are the islands of Arbo, Pago, Isola Longa, Coronata, &amp;c., which border the coasts of ancient Liburnia, now Murlaka."&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Liburnia]] or another location within [[Illyria]]. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] in the 6th century AD,  in his important geographical dictionary entitled Ethnica (Εθνικά), cites Polybius, saying it was a city in Illyria and gives an ethnic name for its inhabitants, calling them Arbonios (Greek: Αρβώνιος) and Arbonites (Greek: Αρβωνίτης).&lt;ref&gt;Ethnica, Epitome, page 111, line 14, : Αρβών πόλις Ιλλυριας.Πολύβιος δευτέρα, το εθνικόν Αρβώνιος και Αρβωνίτης, ως Αντρώνιος και Ασκαλωνίτης.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albanopolis===

"Albanian is an Indo-European language, but like modern Greek and Armenian, it does not have any other closely related living language. Within the Indo-European family, it forms a group of its own. In Albanian, the language is called shqip. Albania is called Shqipëri, and the Albanians call themselves shqiptarë. Until the fifteenth century the language was known as Arbërisht or Arbnisht, which is still the name used for the language in Italy and Greece. The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika. In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name Albanoi to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as Arbanori or Albanon. It is clear that the words Arbëresh, Arvanitika, and even Albanian and Albania are all related to the older name of the language."&lt;/ref&gt;

''Albanoi'' (Ἀλβανόί) reappeared in Byzantine documents in the 11th century, around 1043, as the [[exonym]] of the ''Albanians''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Elsie (2010), Historical Dictionary of Albania, Historical Dictionaries of Europe, 75 (2 ed.) "Their traditional designation, based on a root *alban- and its rhotacized variants *arban-, *albar-, and *arbar-, appears from the eleventh century onwards in Byzantine chronicles (Albanoi, Arbanitai, Arbanites), and from the fourteenth century onwards in Latin and other Western documents (Albanenses, Arbanenses)."&lt;/ref&gt; During the late Byzantine period the names Albanoi, alongside Arbanitai, were used interchangeably, and gradually entered other European languages, in which similar derivative names emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Lloshi, Xhevat (1999). "Albanian" p. 277. "The Albanians of today call themselves shqiptarë, their country Shqipëri, and their language shqipe. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them albanesi (Italian), Albaner (German), Albanians (English), Alvanos (Greek), and Arbanasi (old Serbian), the country Albania, Albanie, Albanien, Alvania, and Albanija, and the language Albanese, Albanisch, Albanian, Alvaniki, and Arbanashki respectively. All these words are derived from the name Albanoi of an Illyrian tribe and their center Albanopolis, noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. Alban could he a plural of alb- arb-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains.&lt;/ref&gt;  The national [[ethnonym]] of the Albanians has derived from this illyrian tribe.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Byzantine Empire'', 324–1453 By Alexander A.

===Arbanon===
''Arbanon'', or ''Albanon'', originally, was a region in the mountainous area to the west of [[Lake Ohrid]] and the upper valley of the river [[Shkumbin]], in the 11th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in late Byzantine history and prosopography Volume 242 of Collected studies Variorum reprints ; CS242 Volume 242 of Variorum reprint Author	Donald MacGillivray Nicol Edition illustrated Publisher Variorum Reprints, 1986 {{ISBN|0-86078-190-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-86078-190-5}} page. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albanians are mentioned in [[Anna Comnena]]'s account ''[[Alexiad]]'', as Arbanites, because of their fights against the [[Normans]] in the region of Arbanon, during the reign of her father [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (1081–1118).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Elsie
Texts and Documents of Albanian History: 1081, Anna Comnena; The Norman Invasion of Albania&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, in the book ''History'' written in 1079-1080, Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]] was first to refer to the Albanoi as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the Arbanitai as subjects of the duke of [[Dyrrachium]].&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis Attaliotae: Historia, Bonn 1853, p. 8, 18, 297&lt;/ref&gt; In later Byzantine usage, the terms ''Arbanitai'' and ''Albanoi'', with a range of variants, were used interchangeably, while sometimes the same groups were also called by the classicising name [[Illyrians]].&lt;ref&gt;Mazaris 1975, pp. 76–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Gregoras (ed. Bonn) V, 6; XI, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finlay37"&gt;{{harvnb|Finlay|1851|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th to 13th centuries, ''Arbanon'' (''{{lang-el|Άρβανον}}'') appears as a principality in Byzantine sources. In 1190 the ''[[Principality of Arbanon]]'' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Principata e Arbërit'') became the first [[Albanian Principalities|Albanian state]] during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Clements 1992, p. 31 "By 1190, Byzantium's power had so receded that the archon Progon succeeded in establishing the first Albanian state of the Middle Ages, a principality"&lt;/ref&gt; Its capital was the city of [[Krujë]],&lt;ref&gt;John V. A. Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest, p.51''.&lt;/ref&gt; the region in which the town of Arbanon originally was located and from which the principality got its name.&lt;ref&gt;Frashëri 1964, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that this toponym has survived continuously since antiquity in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel. "Kosovo, a short history". London: Macmillan, 1998, p.22-40 "...and located their town,'Albanopolis', somewhere to the east of Durres. Some such place-name must have survived there, continuously if somewhat hazily, ever since; there was an area called 'Arbanon' in north-central Albania in the eleventh century, and in the early twentieth century 'Arben' was the local name for a region near Kruja".&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that probably the toponym "Arbanon" has derived from the ancient city of ''Albanopolis''.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel. "Kosovo, a short history". London: Macmillan, 1998, p.22-40 "...and located their town, 'Albanopolis', somewhere to the east of Durres. Some such place-name must have survived there, continuously if somewhat hazily, ever since; there was an area called 'Arbanon' in north-central Albania in the eleventh century, and in the early twentieth century 'Arben' was the local name for a region near Kruja...The continuity of this name is a striking fact;"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mëniku &amp; Campos 2012, p. 2. "In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name Albanoi to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as Arbanori or Albanon. It is clear that the words Arbëresh, Arvanitika, and even Albanian and Albania are all related to the older name of the language."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan Marmullaku - 1975, ''Albania and the Albanians'' - Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin documents the territory was known as [[Arbanum]] and later as ''Albaniae''.&lt;ref&gt;Ćirković, Sima (2007).Der Jugoslawien-Krieg: Handbuch zu Vorgeschichte, Verlauf und Konsequenzen. p.19, "Die Albaner hatten im Verlauf des Mittelalters keinen eigenen Staat, doch besaßen sie ein kompaktes, mit einem Ethnonym versehenes Mutterland (Arbanon, Arbanum, Raban, Regnum Albaniae, Albania).&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in Bulgarian chronicles as ''Arbanas''.&lt;ref&gt;Гюзелев, Боян. Албанци в Източните Балкани, София 2004, p. 29-38; Sofia, 2004 Boyan Guizelev. "ALBANIANS IN THE EASTERN BALKANS": Edited by Vassilka Tankova, p.29-38.&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Serbian sources, the toponym of the country underwent [[Metathesis (linguistics)|linguistic metathesis]] and was rendered as Raban and Rabanski for the people.&lt;ref&gt;Matica 2007, p. 12. "у наведеном цитату привлачи пажњу чињеница, да је Стефан Немања запосео ,,од Рабна оба Пилота’’. Назив ,,Рабна’’ или ,,Рабан’’, као што је већ у исторнографији истакнуто, изведен је метатезом од именнце ,,Арбаном’’ или ,,Арбанум’’, за које знају грчки и латински извори ис XI и XII века. [in the above quotation draws attention to the fact that Stefan Nemanja possessed ,,Rabna of both Pulats’’. The name ,,Rabna’’ or ,,Raban’’, as has already been pointed out in histriography, is derived from the metathesis of the term ,,Arbanom’’ or ,, Arbanum’’, which is known from Greek and Latin sources during the eleventh and twelfth century.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naučna knjiga 1940, p. 729.

"Наши облици Рабан и рабански постали су без сумње од лат. Arbanum на исти начин као што је Rab постало од лат. Arba… [Our forms Raban and rabanski come without doubt from the Latin. Arbanum in the same manner as Rab came from the Lat. Arba...]"&lt;/ref&gt; This is a typical metathesis in Slavic languages, for example the island of ''Arba'' in Croatia now is known as [[Rab]].&lt;ref&gt;Naučna knjiga 1940, p.744. "Наши облици Рабан и рабански постали су без сумње од лат. Arbanum на исти начин као што је Rab постало од лат. Arba… [Our forms Raban and rabanski come without doubt from the Latin. Arbanum in the same manner as Rab came from the Lat. Arba...]"&lt;/ref&gt; However, in later Serbian references the ethnonym for Albanians would appear as ''[[Arbanas]]i''.&lt;ref&gt;Zbornik za Istocnjacku Istorisku i Knjizevnu Gradu 1940, p. 745. "Арбанас, арбанаски, арбански и арбанашки и све остале од исте основе изведене речи постала су од Arbanus. [Arbanas, arbanaski, arbanski and arbanaški and all of the same grounds derived words have come from Arbanus.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Byzantine Empire'', 324–1453 By Alexander A. Vasiliev Edition: 2, illustrated Published by Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1958 {{ISBN|0-299-80926-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-299-80926-3}} (page 613)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Albanians, during the Middle Ages, referred to their country as ''Arbëria'' ({{lang-aln|Arbënia}}) and called  themselves ''[[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]'' ({{lang-aln|Arbëneshë}}).&lt;ref&gt;Demiraj, Bardhyl (2010), pp. 534. "The ethnic name shqiptar has always been discussed together with the ethnic complex: (tosk) arbëresh, arbëror, arbër — (gheg) arbënesh, arbënu(e)r, arbën; i.e. [arbën/r(—)]. p.536. Among the neighbouring peoples and elsewhere the denomination of the Albanians is based upon the root arb/alb, cp. Greek ’Αλβανός, ’Αρβανός "Albanian", ‘Αρβανίτης "Arbëresh of Greece", Serbian Albanac, Arbanas, Bulg., Mac. албанец, Arom. arbinés (Papahagi 1963 135), Turk. arnaut, Ital. albanese, German Albaner etc. This basis is in use among the Arbëreshs of Italy and Greece as well.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamusella, Tomasz (2009). The politics of language and nationalism in modern Central Europe. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.  p. 241. "Prior to the emergence of the modern self-ethnonym Shqiptarë in the mid-16th century (for the first time it was recorded in 1555 by the Catholic Gheg, Gjon Buzuku, in his missal), North Albanians (Ghegs) referred to themselves as Arbën, and South Albanians (Tosks) Arbër. Hence, the self-ethnonym Arbëreshë of the present-day Italo-Albanians (numbering about 100,000) in southern Italy and Sicily, whose ancestors, in the wake of the Ottoman wars, emigrated from their homeland in the 14th century. These self-ethnonyms perhaps influenced the Byzantine Greek Arvanites for ‘Albanians,’ which was followed by similar ones in Bulgarian and Serbian (Arbanasi), Ottoman (Arnaut), Romanian (Arbănas), and Aromanian (Arbineş). Shqiptarë could be derived from Albanian shqipoi (from Latin excipere) for ‘to speak clearly, to understand.’ The Albanian public favors the belief that their self-ethnonym stems from shqipe (‘eagle’) found on the Albanian national flag."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2017 Mate Kapović, Anna Giacalone Ramat, Paolo Ramat; "The Indo-European Languages"; page 554-555&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Balkans]], a similar term is still used today by the [[Aromanians|Vlachs]], who call the Albanians in their language ''Arbineshi''.&lt;ref&gt;Koukoudis, Asterios (2003). The Vlachs: Metropolis and Diaspora. Thessaloniki: Zitros Publications. {{ISBN|9789607760869}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval ethnonym ''Arbanitai'' and its corresponding modern ethnonym ''[[Arvanites]]'' have the same etymology as ''[[Albanians]]'', being  derived from the stem ''Alb-'' by way of a [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]], ''Alb-'' → ''Arb-'' (based on the root *''alban''- and its rhotacized variant *''arban''-).&lt;ref&gt;Elsie 2005, pp. 3–4. "Their traditional designation, based on a root *alban- and its rhotacized variants *arban-, *albar-, and *arbar-, appears from the eleventh century onwards in Byzantine chronicles (Albanoi, Arbanitai, Arbanites), and from the fourteenth century onwards in Latin and other Western documents (Albanenses, Arbanenses)."&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the term  Arvanitis (Ἀρβανίτης) [singular form] was established in  modern Greek language from the original name Alvanitis (Άλβανίτης), who in return derived from ''Alvanos'' (Ἀλβανος).&lt;ref&gt;Theißen, Ulrich (2007), p. 90. "Der ursprüngliche Name Άλβανίτης (abgeleitet von Άλβάνος) wurde im Neugriechischen zu Άρβανίτης… In türkischer Vermittlung erfuhr die Silbe -van- eine Metathese zu -nav-, so dass die türkische Form des Namens für die Albaner arnavut bzw. arnaut Lautet. In dieser Form gelangte das Wort ins Bulgarische (BER I/1971: 15). [The original name Άλβανίτης (derived from Άλβάνος) was established in Modern Greek to Άρβανίτης .... In Turkish the syllable was experienced and mediated as -van- and by metathesis to -nav- so that the Turkish form of the name for the Albanians became respectively Arnavut or Arnaut. In this form, the word came into Bulgarian (BER I / 1971: 15).]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liotta, Peter H. (2001), p. 198. "Among Greeks, the term "Alvanitis"—or "Arvanitis"—means a Christian of Albanian ancestry, one who speaks both Greek and Albanian, but possesses Greek "consciousness." Numerous "Arvanites" live in Greece today.&lt;/ref&gt; Compare the rhotacism of ''alb-'' into ''arv-'' in the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] dialect of [[Italy]].

==Albania (Caucasus)==

Albania as the name of [[Caucasian Albania]], a state and historical region of eastern [[Caucasus]], that existed on the territory of present-day republic of [[Azerbaijan]] and partially southern [[Dagestan]].

However, unlike the names of the other two European countries, this name was an exonym given to them by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], as no one knew what these inhabitants{{Which|date=October 2015}} called themselves. Compare also the land in Caucasus called [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]], and the [[Iberian peninsula]] in Europe.

The [[Udi people]] and their language, the [[Udi language]], are descendants of the ancient people of Caucasian Albania.&lt;ref&gt;V. Minorsky. Caucasica IV. Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 15, No. 3. (1953), pp. 504–529.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gippert; Schulze. : 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/ecling/ecling03.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Albania (Scotland)==

[[Alba]], a [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name for [[Scotland]], may be related to the Greek name of Britain [[Albion]], Latinized as ''Albania'' during the High Medieval period, and later passed into Middle English as [[Albany (disambiguation)|Albany]]. Some recent scholarship has however connected it with one of the early names of [[Ireland]], "[[Fodla]]", which is taken to mean (land of the) "going down" (of the Sun), in contrast to Alba which means (land of the) "rising" (of the Sun). This is consistent with one of the ancient emblems of Scotland consisting of a rising sun crossing the horizon, a symbol laden with much significance.

==Albion (Great Britain)==

[[Albion]] (Ancient Greek: Ἀλβίων) is the oldest known name of the island of Great Britain. Today, it is still sometimes used poetically to refer to the island. The name for Scotland in the Celtic languages is related to Albion: Alba in Scottish Gaelic, Albain in Irish, Nalbin in Manx and Alban in Welsh, Cornish and Breton. These names were later Latinised as Albania and Anglicised as Albany, which were once alternative names for Scotland. New Albion and Albionoria ("Albion of the North") were briefly suggested as possible names of Canada during the period of the Canadian Confederation.

==Albany (New York)==

[[Albany, New York|Albany]] is the [[State capital (United States)|capital]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. The name originates from the Scottish Duke of Albany, whose title comes from the Gaelic name for Scotland Alba.&lt;ref&gt;In: E.G. Cody. The Historie of Scotland. Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons; 1888. {{OCLC|3217086}}. p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[New Netherland]] was captured by the [[Kingdom of England|English]] in 1664, they changed the name Beverwijck to Albany, in honor of the [[Duke of Albany]]. This was a [[Peerage of Scotland|Scottish title]] given since 1398, generally to the second son of the [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (Albany, Dukes of) |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Company |year=1910 |page=487 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTEEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22duke%20of%20albany%22%20scottish%20alba%201398&amp;pg=PA487#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |oclc= 197297659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albany is one of the oldest surviving European settlements from the original [[thirteen colonies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Larnard, J.N. |author.= |title=The New Larned History for Ready Reference and Research |page=195 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTcFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=french+fort+1540+albany&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4pEwTNrEHcX7lwflnIHYCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20fort%201540%20albany&amp;f=false |editor=Donald E.

== Content ==

The book's back cover touts that the book contains ratings for close to 20,000 [[albums]] and 1,700 [[musician]] [[biography|biographies]]. Artists are listed [[alphabetical]]ly and include some of the following: birth and death dates, classification ([[vocal]]s, [[guitar]], [[drum]]s, etc.), a biography, a [[discography]]. The discography listings include a five star rating, the [[music label]] it was released on, and the date as well as possibly reviews of certain albums. These reviews are done by "respected critics" from ''[[Jazz Times]]'' and ''Coda''.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=2093|title=Review at Allaboutjazz.com|accessdate=2006-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905091220/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=2093|archive-date=2005-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''average CPU power''' ('''ACP'''), is a scheme to characterize power consumption of new [[central processing unit]]s under "average" daily usage, especially [[server computer|server]] processors, the rating scheme is defined by [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD) for use in its line of processors based on the [[AMD K10|K10]] microarchitecture ([[Opteron#Micro-architecture update|Opteron 8300 and 2300 series]] processors). This rating is similar to Intel's [[thermal design power]] (TDP) used with Pentium and Core 2 processors, measuring the energy consumption of high workloads, which in numbers are slightly lower than the TDP value of the same processor.

AMD claims the ACP rating includes the power consumption when running several benchmarks, including [[TPC-C]], [[SPEC#Current|SPECcpu2006]], [[SPEC#Current|SPECjbb2005]] and STREAM Benchmark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/|title=Memory bandwidth: Stream benchmark performance results |work=virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (memory bandwidth),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandtech.com/IT/showdoc.aspx?i=3091&amp;p=2 AnandTech report], retrieved September 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/AMD+Unveils+Barcelona+Architecture/article6299.htm DailyTech report], retrieved September 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.dailytech.com/nimage/5925_large_amd_explains_acp.png DailyTech image] detailing ACP, retrieved September 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which AMD said is a better method as a power consumption measurement for [[data center]]s and server intensive workload environments. AMD has said that the ACP and TDP values of the processors will co-exist, and do not replace one another. All server products will see two power figures starting from the codenamed ''Barcelona'' server processor onwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2898">The '''Citation Style Language''' ('''CSL''') is an open [[XML]]-based language to describe the formatting of [[citation]]s and [[bibliographic|bibliographies]]. [[Reference management software|Reference management programs]] using CSL include [[Zotero]], [[Mendeley]] and [[Papers (software)|Papers]].

==History==

CSL was created by Bruce D'Arcus for use with [[OpenOffice.org]],&lt;ref&gt;CiteProc at OpenOffice Bibliographic Project. http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/citeproc/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OpenOffice Bibliographic Project. http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[XSLT]]-based "[[CiteProc]]" CSL processor. CSL was further developed in collaboration with [[Zotero]] developer Simon Kornblith. Since 2008, the core development team consists of D'Arcus, Frank Bennett and Rintze Zelle.

The releases of CSL are 0.8 (March 21, 2009), 0.8.1 (February 1, 2010), 1.0 (March 22, 2010), and 1.0.1 (September 3, 2012). CSL 1.0 was a backward-incompatible release, but styles in the 0.8.1 format can be automatically updated to the CSL 1.0 format.&lt;ref&gt;Update instructions to convert CSL 0.8.1 styles to the 1.0 format. http://citationstyles.org/downloads/upgrade-notes.html#updating-csl-0-8-styles&lt;/ref&gt;

On its release in 2006, [[Zotero]] became the first application to adopt CSL. In 2008 [[Mendeley]] was released with CSL support, and in 2011, [[Papers (software)|Papers]] and [[Qiqqa]] gained support for CSL-based citation formatting.

==Software support==

* [[Zotero]], [[Mendeley]], [[Papers (software)|Papers]], and [[Qiqqa]] all support CSL 1.0 ([[Zotero]] also supports CSL 0.8.1 styles, which are internally updated to CSL 1.0).
* [[Zotero]], [[Mendeley]], and [[Qiqqa]] rely on the ''citeproc-js'' JavaScript CSL processor.
* CSL 1.0 processors have also been written in Haskell (''citeproc-hs''), PHP, Python, and Ruby.&lt;ref name="jv"&gt;Jakob Voß (May 2010), "Quick introduction to the Citation Style Language (CSL)", Lightning Talk proposal European Library Automation Group Conference. http://www.slideshare.net/nichtich/voss-elag-csl2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zotero]], [[Mendeley]], and [[Qiqqa]] provide a built-in CSL editor to help create and modify CSL styles.

==Styles==

The CSL project maintains a CSL 1.0 style repository, which contains over 9000 styles (more than 1700 unique styles).&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase '''Common Sense Revolution''' ('''CSR''') has been used as a political slogan to describe [[conservative]] platforms with a main goal of reducing taxes while balancing the budget by reducing the size and role of government. It has been used in places such as Australia and the U.S. state of [[New Jersey]] in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} This article deals with the "Common Sense Revolution" as it was under [[Ontario]] [[Premier]] [[Mike Harris]], and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] from 1995 to 2002.

==Origin==

From 1943 to 1985, the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party held uninterrupted power in Ontario, under [[Red Tory]] premiers such as [[Leslie Frost]], [[John Robarts]], and [[Bill Davis]]. In 1985, this era of Conservative Premiers (termed the [[Big Blue Machine]] by observers) came to an end when the minority government of Davis' successor, [[Frank Miller (politician)|Frank Miller]], was defeated in the legislature and in the subsequent  [[Ontario general election, 1985|provincial election]] when the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] formed a [[minority government]]  and the Liberal leader, [[David Peterson]], was sworn in as premier. The PC party was again defeated in the [[Ontario general election, 1987|1987 election]] that gave Peterson a [[majority government]].

In 1990, a junior cabinet minister from Miller's former government, Mike Harris, won the leadership of the party which was widely interpreted as a move to the [[political right]], as Harris defeated the more centrist [[Dianne Cunningham]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Harris immediately set about crafting a new image for himself and the party. In his first election in [[Ontario general election, 1990|1990]], he branded himself "the tax fighter".{{citationneeded|date=August 2017}} He strongly opposed an unpopular [[photo-radar]] program introduced by the Liberal government and attacked it as a revenue grab. Despite his party's third place showing in the election (which was won by NDP leader Bob Rae), Harris had managed to improve the party standing in the legislature and bring some attention to his plan. After the 1990 election, Harris and his advisors (including prominent Ontario Tories [[Tony Clement]], then President of the party, Leslie Noble, Alister Campbell and [[Tom Long (politician)|Tom Long]]) set to work creating a more comprehensive reform package to present to the province. The result was the CSR.&lt;ref&gt;Excellent sources for this are Promised Land by John Ibbitson and Right Turn by Christina Blizzard&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSR reform package was markedly [[libertarian]] in nature, closely mirroring the platforms of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] during the 1980s.

The central tenets of the CSR were tax reduction, balancing the budget, reducing the size and role of government, and an emphasis on individual economic responsibility (often summarized by an opposition to government hand-outs). Among other things Harris promised to reduce personal income tax rates by 30% and balance the provincial budget at the same time (which had reached a record $10 billion deficit under the NDP).

The CSR was specifically tailored as a reform document. It was presented as a radical change to the status quo of provincial government business, which was widely seen to be poorly managed and inefficient.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Indeed, the opening words of the document were: "The people of Ontario have a message for their politicians&amp;nbsp;— government isn't working anymore. The system is broken."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==1995 Election and its impact==
{{See also|Ontario general election, 1995|Mike Harris#Common Sense Revolution}}
When [[Bob Rae]] called the [[Ontario general election, 1995|1995 election]], most political commentators were sure that Liberal leader [[Lyn McLeod]] would end up taking the premier's job.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} However, this prediction proved rather premature.

Sticking to the contents of the CSR, Harris fought a campaign focused on simple, easily communicated messages. Specifically, he consistently delivered the party's promises to lower taxes and reduce the number of people on Ontario's social assistance program. The turning point in the election is often considered to be Harris' performance in the televised leader's debate{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Rather than get caught up in the debate between McLeod and Rae, Harris used his camera time to speak directly to the camera to convey CSR points, virtually ignoring all questions asked of him by his opponents. Another major contributing factor was a focussed advertising campaign which stuck to 3 key policy elements - "Work for Welfare, Scrap the Quota Law (Affirmative Action) and Tax Cuts for Jobs&amp;nbsp;— Common Sense for a Change".  Harris and the PC's won a majority government in the election, winning 82 of the province's 130 seats.

Harris was committed to implementing the CSR platform almost in its entirety.  Over several years, income taxes were cut as much as 30%.  Spending cuts in "low priority areas" allowed government spending to be constrained with the exception of health care, where government spending rose each year the PCs were in office (from $17.6B in 1994/95 to $27.6B in 2003/04).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Welfare reforms (including reductions in welfare payments to 'able-bodied citizens' through the division of the former Welfare program into the Ontario Disability Support Program and the Workfare program, which required able-bodied citizens to work for support) contributed to a reduction of welfare consumption in Ontario.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} With economic growth in North America generally strong, Ontario over the next five years outperformed every Canadian province except oil-rich Alberta, every US State and in fact, every OECD nation{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.  This strong growth, (which supporters say is at least in part likely correlated with the favourable economic impact of cuts in marginal tax rates) {{who|date=January 2015}} allowed Harris to eliminate briefly the $11 billion annual deficit he had inherited from previous Premiers David Peterson and Bob Rae. Although the provincial budget was indeed balanced for the last several years of Harris's own time in office, his successor and former deputy Ernie Eves left office with a $5 billion deficit.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario 2004 Budget Papers p69 Table A1 {{cite web |url=http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/english/budget/ontariobudgets/2004/papers_all.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802145647/http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/english/budget/ontariobudgets/2004/papers_all.html |archivedate=2012-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bill 103==
Harris' interest in reforming the political structure of cities dated back to his time in opposition when he led the "Mike Harris Task Force on Bringing Common Sense to Metro" (Toronto), on January 5, 1995.  This in many ways was designed to counter Premier [[Bob Rae]]'s government '''Task Force on the Greater Toronto Area''', chaired by [[Anne Golden]].  When the final report (called the 'Golden Report') was released in 1996, it called for a GTA-tier of local government and for inter-municipal service agencies (based on a similar model to that of [[Metro Toronto]] government).

The net effect of the Golden Report was that it countered the Mike Harris pledge of "less government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/budget/ontariobudgets/1997/spee_.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717032913/http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/budget/ontariobudgets/1997/spee_.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of a larger organizing body for the region ran counter to his party's advocacy of smaller government. Harris had felt that politicians, in particular lower level city councillors, were problematic to his party, and prevented [[free enterprise]].{{how|date=January 2015}} The plan for reduced government might have emulated [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s approach that eliminated [[democracy|democratically]] elected upper-tier city and metropolitan region governments, replacing them with a collection of more politically amenable appointed special-purpose bodies dominated by patronage. ''See [[Greater London Council]]''.

While many suburban municipalities grew rapidly during Harris' first term (1995–1999), some, such as Opposition member [[Bud Wildman]], have argued that the net effect of many CSR policies was to transfer wealth from urban to suburban areas and to refocus services to commuters and suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/hansardEISSUE/36-2/L011a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In a highly controversial move, the City of [[Toronto]] was merged with the five surrounding cities of Metropolitan Toronto to form a new single-tier "megacity" (a term coined by the local media). The Harris government saw the megacity as a cost-cutting measure. The fact that the merger took place in Toronto, a region with a lower proportion Conservative MPPs, further polarized the debate on the merit of the merger. Some municipalities, particularly Toronto, also complained that the government was "downloading" the costs of services that the province had formerly paid for onto local city and municipal governments.

Long before the merger, in October 1996, a focus group conducted by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion|Angus Reid]] for the government warned Municipal Affairs Minister [[Al Leach]] that there would be "considerable public resistance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://list.digital-copyright.ca/pipermail/action-forum/1997-May/000037.html "Leach blames mayors"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010304/http://list.digital-copyright.ca/pipermail/action-forum/1997-May/000037.html |date=2007-09-27 }}. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', May 9, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; to the creation of a unified Toronto. Leach would go on to blame local mayors and community groups for the opposition, going on to be quoted in the same article as saying: ''"In the end, it became a cause célèbre for all of the issues that the government was bringing forward on its agenda"''.

One of the loudest opponents to the new city was former Toronto mayor [[John Sewell]] who led the action group [[Citizens for Local Democracy]].

In April 1997 the government introduced '''Bill 103''' ([[City of Toronto Act]]). The [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] [[filibuster]]ed the legislation by proposing a series of amendments, each of which required the government to consult the residents of a specific street in the city before implementing the amalgamation. One street, Cafon Court in [[Etobicoke, Ontario|Etobicoke]], had its amendment successfully passed when government members inadvertently let one of the NDP amendments pass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/house-proceedings/house_detail.do?locale=en&amp;Date=1997-04-04&amp;Parl=36&amp;Sess=1&amp;detailPage=/house-proceedings/transcripts/files_html/1997-04-04_L176h.htm |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Hansard. Friday, 4 April 1997, volume H |publisher=Ontla.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Tories later voted to strike the Cafon amendment.

The round-the-clock fight at Queen's Park lasted 10 days before the legislation was finally passed on April 21. On January 1, 1998, the new single-tier City of Toronto came into existence, superseding the former two-tier structure of Metropolitan Toronto, and the constituent cities of Toronto, York, North York, Etobicoke, Scarborough and the Borough of East York.

Other controversial municipal amalgamations took place during Harris' second term, including in [[Ottawa]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Greater Sudbury]] and [[Kawartha Lakes, Ontario|Kawartha Lakes]]. Unlike the Toronto amalgamation, however, these all involved large rural areas in addition to the primary urban core. Controversy over the amalgamations remains a significant political issue in some of these cities.{{clarify|date=August 2017}}

==Successor==
Attempting to build on the success of the CSR content and messaging strategy for the 1999 election, Harris and the Ontario Tories branded their new policy document the "Blueprint" (Blue being the official colour of the party). The Blueprint followed the same theoretical framework as its predecessor, yet was tempered for a much different political environment.{{clarify|date=January 2015}} In 1995 the message had been "reform" and "revolution", but after four years of conservative government, the message became a balance between stability and emphasizing that there was still "much left to do". Though not as popular as the CSR, the Blueprint was part of a successful re-election campaign, allowing Harris to win another majority government.

Harris resigned as premier in 2002, and was succeeded by [[Ernie Eves]]. Through a variety of factors, including dissatisfaction with the effects of the government's platform policies, deterioration of municipal services after downloading, the [[Walkerton Tragedy]] during the CSR, and Eves' handling of the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003|Northeast Blackout]], the Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the [[Ontario general election, 2003|2003 provincial election]] by [[Dalton McGuinty]] and the [[Ontario Liberal Party]].

==Legacy==
Municipal amalgamation led to a reduction in the number of [[List of municipalities in Ontario|municipalities in Ontario]] from 850 to 443 and the number of elected municipal officials by 23%, but resulted in an increase in the number of municipal employees by 39% from 1996 to 2011.&lt;ref name="gillis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/01/13/amalgamation_brought_fewer_ontario_cities_but_more_city_workers_report_finds.html|title=Amalgamation brought fewer Ontario cities, but more city workers, report finds|last=Gillis|first=Wendy|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per thousand residents, there were 15.8 municipal employees in 1990 and 20.9 in 2010.&lt;ref name="gillis" /&gt; Part of this resulted from an increase in services by the larger municipalities, or replacement of volunteer staff with full-time staff such as for firefighting services.&lt;ref name="gillis" /&gt; Other contributing factors were the downloading of services from provincial jurisdiction to municipalities, such as [[social assistance]], [[public housing]] and [[public health]].&lt;ref name="gillis" /&gt; The remaining increase resulted from  wage increases associated with amalgamation and an increase in administrative employment, such as hiring more clerks and treasurers.&lt;ref name="gillis" /&gt; Amalgamated municipalities increased employees at twice the rate of those that were not restructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1080152/ontario-municipalities-spending-more-since-amalgamation-report/|title=Ontario municipalities spending more since amalgamation: report|date=13 January 2014|publisher=Global News|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- note: research paper "Did the Common sense Revolution Reduce the Size of Municipal Government in Ontario?" states restructured municipalities increased employment by 3.25 employees/1000 residents from 1996, whereas those not amalgamated increased by 1.77 employees/1000 residents; other findings: amalgamation has "almost universally" not resulted in cost savings, but rural municipalities may have benefited --&gt;

This is a '''comparison between U.S. states and countries by Gross Domestic Product (PPP)'''. Many of the states of the [[United States]] have large [[Gross Domestic Product]] (called [[gross state product]]) which would rank highly on a list of countries world GDP. All data is for the year 2013.

These figures are based on the [[IMF]] list on [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)]] for world GDP, and the [[List of U.S. states by GDP]] figures.

Note: [[New England]] is not a state but a group of states which are oftentimes classified as such.

Note2: As the PPP is calculated in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] for all countries there is no difference for the US economy in [[GDP (nominal)|Nominal]] or in [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] terms as both are the same value for the [[United States|U.S.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.CD&lt;/ref&gt;.

Note3: This table does not take into account the differences in the cost of living between U.S. states.

Conservation of [[cultural heritage]] involves protection and restoration using "any methods that prove effective in keeping that property in as close to its original condition as possible for as long as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walston, S.|year=1978|page=9 |title=The Preservation and Conservation of Aboriginal and Pacific Cultural Material in Australian Museums|journal= ICCM Bulletin |volume=4 |issue= 1|url=http://www.aiccm.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=319:the-preservation-and-conservation-of-aboriginal-and-pacific-cultural-material-in-australian-museums&amp;catid=79:1978-iccm-bulletin-volume-4-no-4&amp;Itemid=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation of cultural heritage is often associated with [[Collection (artwork)|art collections]] and [[museum]]s and involves collection care and management through tracking, examination, documentation, exhibition, storage, preventative conservation, and restoration.&lt;ref name = Szczepanowska2013&gt;Szczepanowska, Hanna M.. 2013. Conservation of cultural heritage: key principles and approaches. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415674744}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope has widened from art conservation, involving protection and care of artwork and architecture, to conservation of cultural heritage, also including protection and care of a broad set of other cultural and historical works. Conservation of cultural heritage can be described as a type of ethical [[stewardship]].

Conservation of cultural heritage applies simple ethical guidelines:
* Minimal intervention;
* Appropriate materials and reversible methods;
* Full documentation of all work undertaken.

Often there are compromises between preserving appearance, maintaining original design and material properties, and ability to reverse changes. Reversibility is now emphasized so as to reduce problems with future treatment, investigation, and use.

In order for conservators to decide upon an appropriate conservation strategy and apply their professional expertise accordingly, they must take into account views of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]], the [[Values (heritage)|values]] and [[Preservation of meaning|meaning]] of the work, and the physical needs of the material.

Cesare Brandi in his ''Theory of Restoration'', describes restoration as "the methodological moment in which the work of art is appreciated in its material form and in its historical and aesthetic duality, with a view to transmitting it to the future".&lt;ref&gt;[Cesare Brandi, ''Teoria del restauro''; Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 1963: reprint, Turin: G. Einaudi, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Key dates===
{{main article|List of dates in the history of art conservation}}

Some consider the tradition of conservation of cultural heritage in Europe to have begun in 1565 with the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes]], but more ancient examples include the work of [[Cassiodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pergoli Campanelli|first=Alessandro|title=Cassiodoro alle origini dell'idea di restauro|year=2013|publisher=Jaca book|location=Milano|isbn=978-88-16-41207-1|page=140|url=https://www.academia.edu/3522730/Cassiodoro_alle_origini_dellidea_di_restauro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brief history===

[[File:Cloître Saint-Trophime Arles Conservation.jpg|thumb|A temporary windowed partition along restoration work area in the cloister of the [[Church of St. Trophime, Arles]]]]
The care of cultural heritage has a long history, one that was primarily aimed at fixing and mending objects for their continued use and aesthetic enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Pye, E, 2001. Caring for the Past: Issues in Conservation for Archaeology and Museums. London: James and James&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 20th century, artists were normally the ones called upon to repair damaged artworks. During the 19th century, however, the fields of science and art became increasingly intertwined as scientists such as [[Michael Faraday]] began to study the damaging effects of the environment to works of art. [[Louis Pasteur]] carried out scientific analysis on paint as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. 2005. p. 41. [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11413&amp;page=41 “Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present”] in (Sackler NAS Colloquium) Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; However, perhaps the first organized attempt to apply a theoretical framework to the conservation of cultural heritage came with the founding in the [[United Kingdom]] of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in 1877. The society was founded by [[William Morris]] and [[Philip Webb]], both of whom were deeply influenced by the writings of [[John Ruskin]]. During the same period, a French movement with similar aims was being developed under the direction of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], an architect and theorist, famous for his restorations of medieval buildings.

[[File:Bixi stele (wrapped), Harvard University, Cambridge, MA - IMG 4607.JPG|thumb|Since 1998, [[Harvard University]] wraps some of the valuable statues on its campus, such as this "[[Harvard Bixi|Chinese stele]]", with waterproof covers every winter, in order to protect them from erosion caused by [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]", Harvard Magazine, March–April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Conservation of cultural heritage as a distinct field of study initially developed in Germany, where in 1888 [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became the first [[chemist]] to be employed by a [[Museum]], the Koniglichen Museen, Berlin ([[Royal Museum (Berlin)|Royal Museums of Berlin]]). He not only developed a scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections, but disseminated this approach by publishing a Handbook of Conservation in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gilberg, Mark.|year=1987|title= Friedrich Rathgen: The Father of Modern Archaeological Conservation|journal= Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=26|issue= 2|pages=105–120 |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/jaic/articles/jaic26-02-004_2.html|doi=10.2307/3179459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early development of conservation of cultural heritage in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums. In the United Kingdom, pioneering research into painting materials and conservation, ceramics, and stone conservation was conducted by [[Arthur Pillans Laurie]], academic chemist and Principal of [[Heriot-Watt University]] from 1900. Laurie's interests were fostered by [[William Holman Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |title=Brief biography of Professor AP Laurie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714201324/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 the chemist [[Dr Harold Plenderleith]] began to work at the [[British Museum]] with Dr. Alexander Scott in the recently created Research Laboratory, although he was actually employed by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] in the early years. Plenderleith's appointment may be said to have given birth to the conservation ''profession'' in the UK, although there had been craftsmen in many museums and in the commercial art world for generations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_science/history.aspx History]. British Museum (2012-06-14). Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; This department was created by the museum to address the deteriorating condition of objects in the collection, damages which were a result of their being stored in the [[London Underground]] tunnels during the [[First World War]]. The creation of this department moved the focus for the development of conservation theory and practice from Germany to Britain, and made the latter a prime force in this fledgling field. In 1956 Plenderleith wrote a significant handbook called The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art, which supplanted Rathgen's earlier tome and set new standards for the development of art and [[Conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]].

In the [[United States]], the development of conservation of cultural heritage can be traced to the [[Fogg Art Museum]], and Edward Waldo Forbes, its director from 1909 to 1944. He encouraged technical investigation, and was Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the first technical journal, Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts, published by the Fogg from 1932 to 1942. Importantly he also brought onto the museum staff chemists. [[Rutherford John Gettens]] was the first of usch in the US to be permanently employed by an art museum. He worked with [[George L. Stout]], the founder and first editor of Technical Studies. Gettens and Stout co-authored Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia in 1942, reprinted in 1966. This compendium is still cited regularly. Only a few dates and descriptions in Gettens' and Stout's book are now outdated.&lt;ref name="Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003"&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. "Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present". The publication exists in two editions. The earlier one is "Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques on Conservation and Analysis" and was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2003. The later edition of the publication is "Arthur M. Sackler Colloquia: Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis". It was published by the National Academies Press in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

George T. Oliver, of [[Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration|Oliver Brothers Art Restoration and Art Conservation-Boston]]
(Est. 1850 in New York City) invented the vacuum hot table for [[lining of paintings|relining]] paintings in 1920s; he filed a patent for the table in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Patent# 2,073,802 [http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=Oliver-George-T.INNM.&amp;OS=IN/Oliver-George-T&amp;RS=IN/Oliver-George-T U.S. "Art of Oil Painting Restoration"], March 16, 1937. Patft1.uspto.gov. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's prototype table, which he designed and constructed, is still in operation. Oliver Brothers is believed to be the first and the oldest continuously operating art restoration company in the United States.

The focus of conservation development then accelerated in Britain and America, and it was in Britain that the first International Conservation Organisations developed. [[International Institute for Conservation|The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC)]] was incorporated under British law in 1950 as "a permanent organization to co-ordinate and improve the knowledge, methods, and working standards needed to protect and preserve precious materials of all kinds."&lt;ref name="Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003"/&gt; The rapid growth of conservation professional organizations, publications, journals, newsletters, both internationally and in localities, has spearheaded the development of the conservation profession, both practically and theoretically. Art historians and theorists such as [[Cesare Brandi]] have also played a significant role in developing conservation science theory. In recent years ethical concerns have been at the forefront of developments in conservation. Most significantly has been the idea of [[preventive conservation]]. This concept is based in part on the pioneering work by [[Garry Thomson]] [[CBE]], and his book the Museum Environment, first published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Museum Environment (2nd Edition), 1986, by Garry Thomson CBE {{ISBN|978-0-7506-2041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson was associated with the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London; it was here that he established a set of guidelines or environmental controls for the best conditions in which objects could be stored and displayed within the museum environment. Although his exact guidelines are no longer rigidly followed, they did inspire this field of conservation.

==Ethics==
The conservator's work is guided by ethical standards. These take the form of [[applied ethics]]. Ethical standards have been established across the world, and national and international ethical guidelines have been written. One such example is:

* [[American Institute for Conservation]] Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=858 AIC – Code of Ethics]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; including examples of codes of ethics and guidelines for professional conduct in conservation and allied fields; and charters and treaties pertaining to ethical issues involving the preservation of cultural property.

As well as standards of practice conservators deal with wider ethical concerns, such as the debates as to whether all art is worth preserving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weil|first=Stephen E.|date=October 1989|title=Too much Art?|journal=[[ArtNews]]|page=232|issn=0004-3273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caring for cultural heritage==

===Collections care===
{{Main article|Collections care}}
Many cultural works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to [[light|visible light]] and [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]]. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels. For example, [[watercolour painting|watercolour paintings]] usually require shielding from sunlight to prevent fading of [[pigment]]s.

Collections care is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

[[Image:Preventive Conservation - Serra da Capivara.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Work of preventive conservation in a rock wall with prehistoric paintings at the [[Serra da Capivara National Park]]. The work consists of filling the cracks to prevent the fragmentation of the wall.]]

===Interventive conservation===
[[File:FurnitureConservation2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Furniture conservation – Re-glueing loose element of solid nut marriage chest (probably Italy, 19th century)]]
A principal aim of a cultural conservator is to reduce the rate of deterioration of an object. Both non-interventive and interventive methodologies may be employed in pursuit of this goal. Interventive conservation refers to any direct interaction between the conservator and the material fabric of the object. Interventive actions are carried out for a variety of reasons, including aesthetic choices, stabilization needs for structural integrity, or cultural requirements for intangible continuity. Examples of interventive treatments include the removal of discolored varnish from a painting, the application of wax to a sculpture, and the washing and rebinding of a book. Ethical standards within the field require that the conservator fully justify interventive actions and carry out documentation before, during, and after the treatment.

One of the guiding principles of conservation of cultural heritage has traditionally been the idea of reversibility, that all interventions with the object should be fully reversible and that the object should be able to be returned to the state in which it was prior to the conservator's intervention. Although this concept remains a guiding principle of the profession, it has been widely critiqued within the conservation profession&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Andrew Oddy]] and Sara Carroll (eds). 1999. Reversibility – Does it Exist? British Museum Occasional Paper Number 135. London: British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now considered by many to be "a fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;p. 185. Muñoz-Viñas, Salvador. 2005. Contemporary Theory of Conservation. London: Elsevier/Butterworth Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important principle of conservation is that all alterations should be well documented and should be clearly distinguishable from the original object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom-cc.icom.museum/Start/ ICOM-CC] International Council of Museums Committee for Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a highly publicized interventive conservation effort would be the conservation work conducted on the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes|Sistine Chapel]].

==Conservation laboratories==
[[Image:The Lunder Conservation Center Laboratory.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Lunder Conservation Center. Conservation staff for both the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] are visible to the public through floor-to-ceiling glass walls that allow visitors to see firsthand all the techniques that [[Conservator (museum)|conservators]] use to examine, treat and preserve artworks within a functioning conservation Laboratory.]]
Conservators routinely use chemical and scientific analysis for the examination and treatment of cultural works. The modern conservation laboratory uses equipment such as [[microscope]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, and various [[x-ray]] regime instruments to better understand objects and their components. The data thus collected helps in deciding the conservation treatments to be provided to the object.

==Country by country look==

===United States===
Heritage Preservation, in partnership with the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]], a U.S. federal agency, produced The Heritage Health Index. The results of this work was the report [http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/summary.html A Public Trust at Risk: The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America's Collections], which was published in December 2005 and concluded that immediate action is needed to prevent the loss of 190 million artifacts that are in need of conservation treatment. The report made four recommendations:
* Institutions must give priority to providing safe conditions for the collections they hold in trust.
* Every collecting institution must develop an emergency plan to protect its collections and train staff to carry it out.
* Every institution must assign responsibility for caring for collections to members of its staff.
* Individuals at all levels of government and in the private sector must assume responsibility for providing the support that will allow these collections to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/ Heritage Health Index].

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Victoria and Albert conservation.jpg|thumb|Conservation in Progress note, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (2014)]]
In October 2006, the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], a governmental department, authored a document: "Understanding the Future: Priorities for England's Museums".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/consultations/cons_uf_prioritiesforenglandsmuseums.pdf Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s Museums]. Department for Culture, Media and Sport. culture.gov.uk. October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This document was based on several years of consultation aimed to lay out the government's priorities for museums in the 21st century.

The document listed the following as priorities for the next decade:

# Museums will fulfil their potential as learning resources (pp 7–10).
#* Museums will be embedded into the delivery of education in every school in the country.
#* Understanding of the effectiveness of museum education will be improved further and best practice built into education programmes.
#* The value of museums' collections as a research resource will be well understood and better links built between the academic community and museums.
# Museums will embrace their role in fostering, exploring, celebrating and questioning the identities of diverse communities (pp 11–14).
#* The sector needs to work with partners in academia and beyond to create an intellectual framework supporting museums' capacity to tackle issues of identity.
#* The museum sector must continue to develop improved practical techniques for engaging communities of all sorts.
# Museums' collections will be more dynamic and better used (pp 15–18).
#* Government and the sector will find new ways to encourage museums to collect actively and strategically, especially the record of contemporary society.
#* The sector will develop new collaborative approaches to sharing and developing collections and related expertise.
# Museums' workforces will be dynamic, highly skilled and representative (pp 17–22).
#* Museums' governing bodies and workforces will be representative of the communities they serve.
#* Find more varied ways for a broader range of skills to come into museums.
#* Improve continuing professional development.
# Museums will work more closely with each other and partners outside the sector (pp 23–26).
#* A consistent evidence base of the contribution of all kinds of museums to the full range of public service agendas will be developed.
#* There will be deeper and longer lasting partnerships between the national museums and a broader range of regional partners.
#* Museums' international roles will be strengthened to improve museum programmes in this country and Britain's image, reputation and relationships abroad.

The conservation profession response to this report was on the whole less than favourable, the [[Institute of Conservation]] (ICON) published their response under the title "A Failure of Vision".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icon.org.uk/images/stories/icon_understanding_the_future.pdf Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s Museums]. The Institute of Conservation. icon.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; It had the following to say:

{{quote| "No sector can look with confidence to the future if its key asset is worked harder and harder across an ever broadening range of objectives while the inputs required to sustain it are neglected." }}

{{quote|"It is of major concern to us that the only part of this section which makes any acknowledgement of the need for greater resourcing is the part which refers to acquisitions. The original consultation paper made quite extensive reference to the importance of collections, the role of new technologies, and cultural property issues, but this appears to have been whittled away in the present document." }}

Concluding: {{quote| "When asked by the Commons Culture Media and Sport elect Committee CMS committee what he would like to see as a priority in the DCMS document arising from the 'Understanding the Future' consultation, Mr MacGregor responded 'I would like to see added there the need to conserve and research the collections, so that the collections can really play the role across the whole of the United Kingdom that they should.'
So would we."}}

Further to this the ICON website summary report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=400&amp;Itemid=15 The Future of Museums: A Failure of Vision]. Icon.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following specific recommendations:

* A national survey to find out what the public want from museums, what motivates them to visit them and what makes for a rewarding visit.
* A review of survey results and prioritisation of the various intrinsic, instrumental and institutional values to provide a clear basis for a 10-year strategy
* HR consultants to be brought in from the commercial sector to review recruitment, career development and working practices in the national and regional museums.
* A commitment to examine the potential for using Museum Accreditation as a more effective driver for improving recruitment, diversity, and career development across the sector.
* DCMS to take full account of the eventual findings of the current Commons Select Committee enquiry into Care of Collections in the final version of this document
* The adoption of those recommendations of the recent House of Lords enquiry into [[Heritage Science#Development of ‘Heritage Science’|Science and Heritage]] which have a potential impact on the future of museums.

In November 2008, the UK-based [[think tank]] [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] published an influential pamphlet entitled ''It's a material world: caring for the public realm'',&lt;ref&gt;
Holden, John. and Samuel Jones. 2008. [http://demos.co.uk/files/Material%20World%20-%20web.pdf It's A Material World: Caring for the public realm]. London: Demos.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they argue for integrating the public directly into efforts to conserve material culture, particularly that which is in the public, their argument, as stated on page 16, demonstrates their belief that society can benefit from conservation as a paradigm as well as a profession:

{{quote|"conservators provide a paradigm not just for fixing things when they are broken, but for a wider social ethos of care, where we individually and collectively take responsibility and action"}}

==Training==
{{main article|Art conservation training}}
Training in conservation of cultural heritage for many years took the form of an [[apprenticeship]], whereby an apprentice slowly developed the necessary skills to undertake their job. For some specializations within conservation this is still the case. However, it is more common in the field of conservation today that the training required to become a practicing conservator comes from a recognized university course in conservation of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="AIC training" &gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/training AIC – Becoming a Conservator]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University can rarely provide all the necessary training in first hand experience that an apprenticeship can, and therefore in addition to graduate level training the profession also tends towards encouraging conservation students to spend time as an [[intern]].

Conservation of cultural heritage is an [[interdisciplinary]] field as conservators have backgrounds in the [[fine arts]], sciences (including [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[materials science]]), and closely related disciplines, such as [[art history]], [[archaeology]], [[studio art]], and [[anthropology]]. They also have design, fabrication, artistic, and other special skills necessary for the practical application of that knowledge.

Within the various schools that teach conservation of cultural heritage, the approach differs according to the educational and vocational system within the country, and the focus of the school itself. This is acknowledged by the [[American Institute for Conservation]] who advise "Specific admission requirements differ and potential candidates are encouraged to contact the programs directly for details on prerequisites, application procedures, and program curriculum".&lt;ref name="AIC training" /&gt;

In France, training for heritage conservation is taught by the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). 

==Associations and professional organizations==
{{main article|Conservation associations and professional organizations}}
Societies devoted to the care of cultural heritage have been in existence around the world for many years. One early example is the founding in 1877 of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in Britain to protect the built heritage, this society continues to be active today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spab.org.uk/html/what-is-spab/history-of-the-spab/ History of the SPAB]. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The built heritage was at the forefront of the growth of member based organizations in the [[United States]]. [[Preservation Virginia]], founded in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in 1889 as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apva.org/ APVA Preservation Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613122322/http://www.apva.org/ |date=2008-06-13 }}. Apva.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider field, and within their area of specialization.

These organizations exist to "support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/about About AIC – Overview]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

This involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among cultural conservators, allied professionals, and the public.

Throughout history, [[spider]]s have been depicted in popular culture, mythology and in symbolism. From [[Greek mythology]] to [[African folklore]], the spider has been used to represent a variety of things, and endures into the present day with characters such as [[Shelob]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and [[Spider-Man]] from the eponymous comic series.  It is also a symbol of mischief and malice for its toxic venom and the slow death it causes, which is often seen as a curse.&lt;ref name ="Garai73"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-21773-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the spider has inspired creations from an ancient [[geoglyph]] to a modern [[steam-punk]] [[spectacle]]. Spiders have been the [[arachnophobia|focus of fears]], stories and mythologies of various cultures for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Vos |first=Gail |title=Tales, Rumors, and Gossip: Exploring Contemporary Folk Literature in Grades 7–12 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |year=1996 |isbn=1-56308-190-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M8bvN93y-fIC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=spiders+folklore+and+mythology |accessdate=2008-04-22 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spider has symbolized patience and persistence due to its hunting technique of setting [[Spider web|webs]] and waiting for its prey to become ensnared. Numerous cultures attribute the spider's ability to spin webs with the origin of [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[weaving|textile weaving]], [[basketry]], [[knotwork]] and [[Fishing net|net making]]. Spiders are associated with creation myths because they seem to weave their own artistic worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Laguna |first=Frederica |title=American Anthropology: Papers from the American Anthropologist |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-8032-8280-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XIFX-sSYURwC&amp;pg=PA455&amp;dq=Spider+creation+myth |accessdate=2008-04-21 |page=455}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophers often use the spider's web as a [[metaphor]] or [[analogy]]; and today, terms such as the ''[[Internet]]'' or ''[[World Wide Web]]'' evoke the inter-connectivity of a spider web.&lt;ref name=CSI(2006) /&gt;

== In folklore and mythology ==
The spider, along with its web, is featured in mythological fables, [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]], artistic spiritual depictions, and in [[oral tradition]]s throughout the world since ancient times.

===Ancient Near East===
[[Uttu]], the [[Sumerian religion|ancient Sumerian goddess]] of weaving, was envisioned as a spider spinning her web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black |first1=Jeremy |first2=Anthony |last2=Green |title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|location=London, England|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992 |isbn= 0-7141-1705-6|page=182|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobsen1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Thorkild|date=1987|title=The Harps that Once--: Sumerian Poetry in Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-BI0h41yCEC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=Uttu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivxKmTy7fYAhWBQ98KHWxSBNkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Uttu&amp;f=false|location=New Haven, Connecticut|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-07278-3|page=184|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the myth of ''Enki and Ninsikila'', she was the daughter of the water god [[Enki]].&lt;ref name="Jacobsen1987"/&gt; After being warned by Enki's wife [[Ninhursag]] that he would attempt to seduce her,&lt;ref name="Jacobsen1987"/&gt; Uttu ensconced herself inside her web,&lt;ref name="Jacobsen1987"/&gt; but agreed to let Enki in after he promised to marry her and give her fresh [[produce]] as a marriage gift.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen1987"/&gt; After giving Uttu the produce, Enki [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] her with [[beer]] and [[rape]]d her.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen1987"/&gt; Ninhursag heard Uttu's screams and rescued her,&lt;ref name="Jacobsen1987"/&gt; removing Enki's [[semen]] from her [[vagina]] and planting it in the ground to produce eight previously-nonexistent plants.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen1987"/&gt;

In [[Ancient Egypt]], the spider was associated with the goddess [[Neith]] in her aspect as spinner and weaver of destiny, this link continuing later through the [[Babylonia]]n [[Ishtar]] and the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Arachne]],&lt;ref name = "Cooper92"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=J. C. |title=Symbolic and Mythological Animals |pages=214–15 |year=1992 |publisher= Aquarian Press |location=London |isbn=1-85538-118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[Interpretatio graeca|later equated]] as the [[Roman goddess]] [[Minerva]].

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
A notable ancient legend from the [[Western canon]] that explains the origin of the spider comes from the Greek story of the [[weaving]] competition between [[Athena]] the goddess, and Arachne, sometimes described as a princess. This story may have originated in [[Lydia#Lydia in Greek mythology|Lydian mythology]];{{efn|Lydian mythology is virtually unknown, therefore myths involving [[Lydia]] are mainly from [[Greek mythology]].}} but the myth, briefly mentioned by [[Virgil]] in 29 BC,{{efn|"''Or spider, victim of Minerva's spite, &amp;nbsp;Athwart the doorway hangs her swaying net. &amp;nbsp;The more impoverished they, the keenlier all &amp;nbsp;To mend the fallen fortunes of their race.''"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Georgics/IV|''Georgics/IV'']] on [[Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil (ca. 029 B.C.)

[[File:Arachne.jpg|thumb|Arachne depicted as a half-spider half-human in [[Gustave Doré]]'s illustration for an 1861 edition of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[Purgatorio]]'']]
This myth tells of Arachne, the daughter of a famous [[Tyrian purple]] wool dyer in [[Hypaepa]] of [[Lydia]]. Due to her father's skill with cloth dyeing, Arachne became adept in the art of weaving. Eventually, she began to consider herself to be a greater weaver than the goddess Athena herself, and challenged the goddess to a weaving contest to prove her superior skill. Athena wove the scene of her victory over [[Poseidon]] that had earned her the patronage of Athens, while Arachne wove a tapestry featuring many episodes of infidelity among the [[Gods of Olympus]], which angered Athena. The goddess conceded that Arachne's weaving was flawless, but she was infuriated by the mortal's pride. In a final moment of anger, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and loom with her [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] and cursed Arachne to live with extreme guilt. Out of sadness, Arachne soon hanged herself. Taking pity on her, Athena brought her back to life transformed as a spider, using the poison [[Aconitum|aconite]];{{efn|Ovid describes the poison as "extract of herbs of Hecate";&lt;ref name=Ovid-Met.6:87/&gt; [[Hecate]] being the Greek goddess and sorceress said to have invented aconite ([[Aconitum napellus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leyel|first1=Mrs. M. Grieve ; with an introduction by the editor, Mrs. C.F.|title=''"Aconite", in: ''A Modern Herbal''|date=1982|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=0486227987|edition=Botanical.com; online|url=https://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/a/aconi007.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  "—''and ever since, Arachne, as a spider, weaves her web''."&lt;ref name=Ovid-Met.6:87&gt;{{cite web|last1=More|first1=Brookes|title=P. Ovidius Naso : ''Metamorphoses''; Book 6, lines 87–145|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng1:6.87-6.145|website=Perseus Digital Library Project|publisher=Cornhill Publishing Co.|location=Boston|year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar [[Robert Graves]] proposed Ovid's tale may have its roots in the commercial rivalry between the Athenian citizenry of Greece and that of [[Miletus]] in Asia Minor, which flourished around 2000 BC.  In Miletus, the spider may have been an important figure; seals with spider emblems have been recovered there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graves |first=R |authorlink=Robert Graves |title=Greek Myths |year=1955|publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0-14-001026-2 |chapter=Athene's Nature and Deeds|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
In [[African mythology]], the spider is personified as a creation deity [[Anansi]], and as a [[trickster]] character in [[African folklore|African traditional folklore]]. There are many variations of the name including [[Kwaku Ananse]] of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] in West Africa (his original name) and [[anglicize]]d as [[Aunt Nancy]] (or Sister Nancy) in the [[West Indies]] and some other parts of the Americas.&lt;ref name="Mythology:MLF2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanton]|first=[chief consultant, Alice Mills ; editors, Janet Parker, Julie|title=Mythology : Myths, Legends, &amp; Fantasies|year=2003|publisher=Global Book Pub.|location=Willoughby, NSW|isbn=1740480910|page=317|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories of Ananse became such a prominent and familiar part of Ashanti oral culture that the word Anansesem—"spider tales"—came to embrace all kinds of fables. This fed into the ''Anansi toree'' or "spider tales"; stories that were brought over from Africa and told to children of [[Maroon people]] and other Africans in the [[diaspora]].  These tales are [[Apologue|allegorical stories]] that teach a [[Morality|moral lesson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Counter|first=S.

[[North American mythology|North American cultures]] have traditionally depicted spiders. The Native American [[Lakota people]]'s oral tradition also includes a spider-trickster figure, which is [[Iktomi|known by several names]].

In this story, Spider Grandmother thought the world into existence through the conscious weaving of her webs.

It is part of the [[Ventarron]] temple complex and is known as Collud. The Cupisnique spider deity was associated with hunting nets, textiles, war, and power. One image depicts spider deities holding nets filled with decapitated human heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orozco|first1=José|title="Spider God" Temple Found in Peru|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/10/081029-peru-temple.html|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=21 February 2018|date=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiders are depicted in [[Indigenous Australian art]], in [[rock painting|rock]] and [[bark painting]]s, and for [[Totems|clan totems]].

[[File:Yoshitoshi-Spider Princess.gif|thumb|''Apparition of the Spider Princess''&lt;br /&gt;Depicting [[Tsuchigumo]] (top right)&lt;br /&gt;[[Woodblock print]] by [[Yoshitoshi]], 1887]]
The ''[[Tsuchigumo]]'' (translated as "Earth spiders"){{efn|The term ''Tsuchigumo'' also refers to a mythical ethnic group said to live in caverns beneath the mountains in the [[Japanese Alps]] until at least the [[Asuka period]]; also loosely used for bandits and thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hudson |first=Mark |authorlink= |others= |title=Ruins of Identity: Ethnogenesis in the Japanese Islands |origyear= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eTFMPO5NdKgC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=Tsuchigumo |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1999 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-8248-2156-4 |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=|page=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} of [[Japan]], is a mythical, supernatural creature faced by the legendary [[Minamoto no Raiko]]. Depending on the version of the story, the ''Tsuchigumo'' was able to take the visage of either a boy or a woman. In one version, while on a search for a mythical giant skull, Minamoto is lured to a house and placed in an illusion created by a ''Tsuchigumo'' in the guise of a young boy. However, after suspecting foul play, Minamoto breaks this illusion by striking out at him with his sword. Minamoto then discovers himself as actually being covered in a spider's web, and after tracking him down, learns that the boy is in reality, a giant spider ''Tsuchigumo''.

Another Japanese mythological spider figure is the ''[[Jorōgumo]]'' ("prostitute spider") which is portrayed as being able to transform into a seductive woman.  In some instances, the ''Jorōgumo'' attempts to seduce and perhaps marry passing [[samurai]].  In other instances she is venerated as a goddess dwelling in the [[Jōren Falls]] who saves people from drowning.  Her name also refers to a golden orb-spider species ''[[Nephila clavata]]'' (''Jorō-gumo'', or Jorō spider).

An [[Islam]]ic [[Hadith|oral tradition]] holds that during the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]], the journey from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]], [[Muhammad]] and his [[Sahaba|companion]] [[Abu Bakr]] were being pursued by [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] soldiers, and they decided to take refuge in the [[Cave of Thawr]].  The tale goes on to say that [[Allah]] commanded a spider to weave a web across the opening of the cave. After seeing the spider's web, the Quraysh passed the cave by, since Muhammad's entry to the cave would have broken the web. Since then, it has been held in many Muslim traditions that a spider, if not [[Al-Ankabut|holy]], is at least to be respected. A similar story occurs in the [[Jewish]] [[Aggadah|tradition]], where it is [[King David|David]] who is being chased by [[King Saul]].  David hides in a cave, and Saul and his men do not bother to search the cave because, while David was hiding inside, a spider had spun a web over the mouth of the cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 7|year=1910|publisher=The Encyclopædia Britannica company|page=855|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2x8qAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA855|edition=11|editor=Hugh Chisholm|quote=According to a late Rabbinical story, David, like Bruce of Scotland, was once saved by a spider which spun its web over the cave wherein he was concealed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The story of David hiding in a cave from Saul appears in the Bible ([[Book of Samuel]], Ch.24), but without the reference to the spiderweb.}}

===Post-classical Europe===
The 10th-century Saint [[Conrad of Constance]] is sometimes represented as a [[Bishop of Constance|bishop]] holding a [[chalice]] with a spider.

The epic poem ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', written by [[Ovid]] two millennia ago, includes the metamorphosis of [[Arachne]].  This was retold in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s depiction as the half-spider Arachne in the 2nd book of his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', ''[[Purgatorio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alighieri|first=Dante|title=Divine Comedy|chapter=Purgatorio, Canto XII|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy/Purgatorio/Canto_XII|accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered as the earliest known work of science fiction in Western literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=S.C.

In the 15th century, the [[Kings of France|French king]] [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] acquired the nickname "the universal spider" (''l'universelle aragne''), from [[Georges Chastelain]], a chronicler of the [[List of Dukes of Burgundy|dukes of Burgundy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delisle.enc.sorbonne.fr/enc/concours/concours/sites/default/files/texte_complet2008.pdf|title=Histoire du Moyen Âge|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the king's tendency to implement schemes and plans during [[League of the Public Weal|his contention with Burgundy]] and the following conflicts with [[Charles the Bold]].  In the 16th-century Chinese folk novel, [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s ''[[Journey to the West]]'', the buddhist monk [[Tang Sanzang]]'s odyssey includes being trapped in a spider's cave and bound by beautiful women and many children, who are transformations of spiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personages in 'The Journey To The West'|url=http://godsdirectcontact.eu/eng/services/s-bc-journey.htm|work=News 97, Noteworthy Book|publisher=The Supreme Master Ching Hai International Association|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spider gained an evil reputation from the 1842 [[Biedermeier]] [[novella]] by [[Jeremias Gotthelf]], ''[[The Black Spider]]''.  In this allegorical tale which was adapted to various media, the spider symbolizes evil works and represents the moral consequences of making a [[Deal with the Devil|pact with the devil]].

[[Clark Ashton Smith deities#Atlach-Nacha|Atlach-Nacha]] is the creation of [[Clark Ashton Smith]] and first appeared in his short story "The Seven Geases" (1934). Atlach-Nacha resembles a huge spider with an almost-human face. In the story, Atlach-Nacha is the reluctant recipient of a human sacrifice given to it by the toad-god [[Tsathoggua]].

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the creature’s daughter [[Shelob]] is encountered as Frodo and Sam move through the mountain pass of Cirith Ungol. Shelob was featured in the film adaption of the last book of the ''Lord of the Rings'' series.&lt;ref name="LOTR"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tolkien |first=J. R.

He also resurrected the [[Old English]] words ''cob'' and ''lob'' for "spider".&lt;ref name="rateliff"/&gt;

The 1952 children's novel ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' written by [[E. B.

More recently, giant spiders have featured in books such as the 1998 fantasy novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' by [[J. K. Rowling]].&lt;ref name="Harry Potter"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowling |first=J.

In ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', a book about many of the creatures within the [[Harry Potter universe]], these giant spiders are also known as [[Acromantula]]s.

The spider is also found in modern children's tales. The [[nursery rhyme]]s "[[Itsy Bitsy Spider]]" and "[[Little Miss Muffet]]" have spiders as focal characters. The poem "[[The Spider and the Fly (poem)|The Spider and the Fly]]" (1829) by [[Mary Howitt]] is a cautionary tale of seduction and betrayal which later inspired a [[The Spider and the Fly (1949 film)|1949 film]] and a [[The Spider and the Fly (song)|1965 Rolling Stones song]], each sharing the same title, as well as a 1923 cartoon by [[Aesop's Film Fables|Aesop Fables Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fable of the Spider and the Fly|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146710/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Will you walk into my parlour?” said the Spider to the Fly,
&amp;nbsp;'Tis the prettiest little parlour that ever you did spy;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The way into my parlour is up a winding stair,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And I've a many curious things to shew when you are there.”

“Oh no, no,” said the little Fly, “to ask me is in vain,
&amp;nbsp;For who goes up your winding stair
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-can ne'er come&amp;nbsp;down&amp;nbsp;again.''”
{{hidden begin |bodystyle="width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}}
“I'm sure you must be weary, dear, with soaring up so high;
&amp;nbsp;Will you rest upon my little bed?” said the Spider to the Fly.
“There are pretty curtains drawn around; the sheets are fine and thin,
&amp;nbsp;And if you like to rest awhile, I'll snugly tuck you in!”

“Oh no, no,” said the little Fly, &amp;nbsp;“for I've often heard it said,
&amp;nbsp;They never, never wake again, who sleep upon your bed!''”


Said the cunning Spider to the Fly, &amp;nbsp;“Dear friend what can I do,
&amp;nbsp;To prove the warm affection I 've always felt for you?
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have within my pantry, good store of all that's nice;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm sure you're very welcome — will you please to take a slice?”

“Oh no, no,” said the little Fly, &amp;nbsp;“kind Sir, that cannot be,
&amp;nbsp;I've heard what's in your pantry, and I do not wish to see!”


“Sweet creature!” said the Spider, &amp;nbsp;“you're witty and you're wise,
&amp;nbsp;How handsome are your gauzy wings, how brilliant are your eyes!
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I've a little looking-glass upon my parlour shelf,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you'll step in one moment, dear, you shall behold yourself.”

“I thank you, gentle sir,” she said, &amp;nbsp;“for what you 're pleased to say,
&amp;nbsp;And bidding you good morning now, I'll call another day.”


The Spider turned him round about, and went into his den,
For well he knew the silly Fly would soon come back again:
So he wove a subtle web, in a little corner sly,
And set his table ready, to dine upon the Fly.

Then he came out to his door again, and merrily did sing,
“Come hither, hither, pretty Fly, with the pearl and silver wing;
&amp;nbsp;Your robes are green and purple — there's a crest upon your head;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Your eyes are like the diamond bright, but mine are dull as lead!”

Alas, alas! how very soon this silly little Fly,
Hearing his wily, flattering words, came slowly flitting by;
With buzzing wings she hung aloft, then near and nearer drew,
Thinking only of her brilliant eyes, and green and purple hue —
Thinking only of her crested head — poor foolish thing!
At last,
Up jumped the cunning Spider, and fiercely held her fast.
He dragged her up his winding stair, into his dismal den,
Within his little parlour — but she ne'er came out again!


And now dear little children, who may this story read,
To idle, silly flattering words, I pray you ne'er give heed:
Unto an evil counsellor, close heart and ear and eye,
And take a lesson from this tale, of the Spider and the Fly.

In [[graphic novel]]s, spiders are often adapted by [[superhero]]es or [[villain]]s as their symbols or [[alter ego]]s due to the arachnid's strengths and weaknesses. One of the most notable characters in comic book history has taken his identity from the spider, the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book hero [[Spider-Man]]. Peter Parker was accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider and then, as Spider-Man, was able to scale tall buildings and shoot web fluid from a device attached to his wrist. Along with these abilities, came super senses and instant reflexes. Writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] originated this franchise.  Due to the character's popularity, Spider-Man appeared in [[Spider-Man in other media|movies and various other media]]. In addition to Spider-Man, the [[Marvel universe]] includes several subsequent characters using the spider as their patron; including [[Spider-Woman]], [[Spider-Girl]], the [[Scarlet Spider]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Araña]], [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], and [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]].  The [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] also include characters named [[Spider Girl]] and [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]].

Many other comic book, [[manga]] and [[anime]] characters have taken the guise of a spider, such as [[Black Spider]] from the [[Batman]] universe;&lt;ref name ="Black spider"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moench |author2=Jones &amp; Beatty |title=''[[Batman]]'' #518|date=May 1995 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Pokémon]] franchise, [[Spinarak]] and [[Ariados]], [[Joltik]] and [[Galvantula]], and [[Dewpider]] and [[Araquanid]], are all variously based on spiders.  In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' series, [[Anansi (Static Shock)|Anansi the Spider]] takes his name and techniques from the African trickster god. In the second season of the anime based on the manga [[Kuroshitsuji]], one main antagonist, the demon butler Claude Faustus, has spider-like qualities and powers. He is also capable of transforming into a spider and making webs.

In the manga ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'', the titular character is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one that he got when he was nine years old. He used to let them go into his mouth and he'd imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.

The [[Ghost in The Shell]] manga by [[Masamune Shirow]] prominently features spider-like, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called [[Fuchikoma]] (evolving into the [[Tachikoma]], Uchikoma and Logicoma in subsequent anime versions of the series). These mobile weapons platforms are used by the members of [[Section 9]] to aid in their various missions.
In the [[Monster Musume]] manga by [[Okayado]] the character Rachnera Arachnera is an Arachne who is feared by her host family and initially abandoned. She demonstrates skills in web weaving. She initially hated humans for how judgemental they were of
but Kimihito was able to change her mind,
she now lives with him.

== In film and television ==

Spiders have been present for many decades both in film and on television, predominantly in the [[Horror fiction|horror genre]]. Those who suffer from [[arachnophobia]], an acute fear of spiders, become particularly horrified. The spider web is used as a motif to adorn dark passageways, depicting the recesses of the unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Gaea|first=Ashleen|title=Celebrating the Seasons of Life: Samhain to Ostara : Lore, Rituals, Activities, and Symbols|year=2004|publisher=Career Press|isbn=1-56414-731-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LFK7x0UeIxIC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=spiderweb+symbol#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}

This trilogy also includes the Ing, antagonists of ''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes|Echoes]],'' whose warrior forms resemble five-legged spiders.  ''[[Atlach-Nacha]]'' is an [[H-game]] centered on a spider demon disguising herself as a human. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, giant spiders are a frequent foe. In particular, ''[[Ocarina of Time]]'' features large spiders named Skulltulas, and ''[[Twilight Princess]]'' has an enormous spider [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]. A spider-like creature named Muffet is featured in the 2015 video game [[Undertale]].

In the [[Lego]] toyline [[Bionicle]] series, the Visorak horde is a species consisting of six spider-like breeds. They are created by the Brotherhood of Makuta to conquer islands; they possess [[mutagenic]] venom and spin sticky green webs. In the [[Transformers]] franchise, [[Tarantulas (Transformers)|Tarantulas]] and [[Blackarachnia]] are both [[Predacons]] that turn into giant spiders. Blackarachnia, being part biological, has venom that paralyzes other Transformers and she is capable of spinning webs.

=== Modern myths and urban legends === &lt;!--Huntsman spider article links to here--&gt;
The widespread [[urban legend]] that one swallows a high number of spiders during sleep in one's life has no basis in reality. A sleeping person causes all kinds of noise and vibrations by breathing, the beating heart, snoring etc. all of which warn spiders of danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spider Myths - Swallowing Spiders|url=http://www.burkemuseum.org/spidermyth/myths/whileyousleep.html|publisher=Burke Museum|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sneed|first1=Annie|title=Fact or Fiction?

[[Huntsman spider]]s are large and swift, often eliciting [[arachnophobia|arachnophobic]] reactions from susceptible people, and are the subject of many superstitions, exaggerations and myths. The ''banana spider'' myth claims that the Huntsman spider lays its eggs in banana flower blossoms, resulting in spiders inside the tip of bananas, waiting to terrorize an unsuspecting consumer.  This is supposed to explain why monkeys allegedly peel bananas from the "wrong" end.&lt;ref name=Crawford-Myths&gt;{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Rod|title=Spider Myths: How'd those eggs get in there?|url=http://www.burkemuseum.org/spidermyth/myths/banana.html|work=The Spider Myths Site|publisher=Burke Museum of Natural History &amp; Culture|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another urban legend, daddy long legs ''([[Pholcidae]])'' have potent venom, but their fangs are too short to deliver the poison. This myth might have arisen due to its similarity in appearance with the [[Brown recluse spider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jacqui|title=A baobab is big &amp; other verses from Africa |publisher=Struik |year=2005|page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lNdujWnq_ZkC&amp;pg=PT77&amp;dq=daddy+long+legs+poison+myth | isbn=978-1-86872-718-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[MythBusters (2004 season)#Daddy Long-Legs|2004 episode]] of [[Discovery Channel]]'s ''[[MythBusters]]'', it was shown that host [[Adam Savage]] survived a bite from the spider.

[[The Spider Bite|''The Spider Bite'' legend]] emerged in Europe in the late 1970s.  In most versions of this tale, a young vacationing female sunbather is bitten on the cheek by a spider.  After seeking medical attention for the resultant swelling, hundreds of tiny spiders are discovered emerging from her lanced wound, which causes the victim to go insane.

'''''Duck Amuck''''' is an American [[Surrealism|surreal]] [[animated cartoon]] directed by [[Chuck Jones]] and produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]. The short film was released in early 1953 by [[The Vitaphone Corporation]], the short subject division of [[Warner Bros.]], as part of the ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' series. It stars [[Daffy Duck]], who is tormented by a seemingly sadistic, initially unseen animator, who constantly changes Daffy's locations, clothing, voice, physical appearance and even shape, much to Daffy's aggravation and rage.  Pandemonium reigns throughout the cartoon as Daffy attempts to steer the action back to some kind of normality, only for the animator to either ignore him or, more frequently, to over-literally interpret his increasingly frantic demands. In the end, the tormenting animator is revealed to be [[Bugs Bunny]].

In 1994, it was voted #2 of [[The 50 Greatest Cartoons]] of all time by members of the animation field, losing only to ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]'', also made by [[Chuck Jones]] and also written by [[Michael Maltese]]. It remains one of the most notable Warner Bros. animations, and has been inducted into the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

The short was included on the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]]'' [[DVD]] box set (with optional audio commentary by Michael Barrier), ''[[The Essential Daffy Duck]]'' DVD box set, and the ''[[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1]]'' [[Blu-ray]] box set. The short inspired the 2007 [[Nintendo DS]] game ''[[Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck]]''.

==Plot==
The cartoon's title sequence and opening scene suggest [[Daffy Duck]] is to star as a [[musketeer]], and he appears, boldly engaging in an action scene with a [[fencing]] [[Foil (fencing)|foil]]. As he thrusts the foil and advances, the background abruptly disappears, leaving a plain white screen. Confused by this, Daffy turns to the animator and asks him to complete the scenery. However, instead of a castle from the original scene, the animator paints a farm scene. Daffy returns and starts to repeat his musketeer opening, but quickly notices the different background. He walks off screen and returns dressed as a farmer, while singing a version of "[[Old MacDonald Had a Farm]]", but a few seconds later, the scene segues into an Arctic backdrop; Daffy changes into winter clothes and skies through the snow (to "[[Jingle Bells]]") and into a [[Hawaii]]an setting. Still dutifully, but impatiently, going through the changes, Daffy returns in Hawaiian garb. After a couple of bars of "[[Aloha ʻOe|Aloha 'Oe]] (Farewell To Thee)" on [[ukulele]], Daffy ends up back in the plain white background.

While Daffy tries to reason with the animator that cartoons should have scenery, he becomes completely erased and, upon asking where he is, he gets redrawn as a [[cowboy]] with a guitar. Daffy tries to play it but there is nothing but silence. Using a sign, he requests sound and is granted various non-guitar sound effects. Daffy also finds himself generating random sound effects when he tries to speak, and finally regains his voice when he becomes enraged and shouts angrily at the animator. ("AND I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HUMILIATED IN ALL MY LIFE!")

Regaining his composure, Daffy demands some new scenery and is given an amateurish line-art cityscape background in pencil. Daffy asks for color, prompting the animator to slap various colors and patterns all over him ("NOT ME, YOU SLOP ARTIST!!"). All but Daffy's face is erased and, upon asking where the rest of him has gone, he is redrawn as a bizarre mismatched animal with a "screwball" flag on its tail. As Daffy walks off (wondering to himself if he weren't living up to his contract and if he hasn't been keeping himself trim), he becomes aware of not feeling quite like himself; the animator creates a mirror and, upon seeing his hideous self, Daffy once again bursts out in anger ("EEK! You know better than that!"). Everything is erased and Daffy is redrawn this time [[Sailor suit|as a sailor]]. He begins to sing "[[The Song of the Marines]]" as the animator draws an ocean scene with an island in the background, but draws nothing under Daffy, resulting in him falling into the ocean and surfacing on the island.  When he requests a closeup, the screen contracts around him, at which he screams, and the camera zooms up uncomfortably close to his angry bloodshot eyes.  He walks away muttering a sarcastic thanks to the animator.

As Daffy tries once again to negotiate with the animator to have an understanding, the screen frame falls on him. After failing to keep the frame up with a stick, Daffy goes ballistic and rips apart the black background. Now at the end of his rope, Daffy demands, "Let's get this picture started", so the camera does an [[iris shot|iris-out]] to black, followed by a "The End" slide, which a frustrated Daffy pushes off camera, screaming, "NO, NO!" as he does so. Daffy suggests that he and the animator go their separate ways and (hoping, against hope, that nothing further will happen) begins a dance routine which is quickly interrupted when the film runs out of alignment, resulting in two Daffys on the screen. They argue with each other and almost start a fight, but one Daffy is erased just as the other throws a punch.

The animator then turns Daffy into a pilot and draws him into an airplane. The duck excitedly flies around until a mountain is drawn in his path. The plane crashes off-screen, leaving Daffy with nothing but the plane's steering wheel and windshield. He "bails" out of the plane's remains and floats downward with his parachute which is replaced with an anvil. Crashing to the ground, a disoriented Daffy hammers the anvil while dizzily reciting "[[The Village Blacksmith]]".{{citation needed|date=December 2013|reason=I thought the whole point was that Daffy was supposed to be speaking gibberish...?}} The animator changes the anvil into an [[artillery]] shell which explodes after a few more hammer strikes. Daffy finally snaps and angrily demands that the animator reveal himself; they do, but not before drawing a door around Daffy and closing it on him. The camera pulls back and reveals the guilty party to be [[Bugs Bunny]] at a drawing table, who turns around and says to the audience: "Ain't I a stinker?"

==History==
[[File:Duck Amuck.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A scene from ''Duck Amuck''.]]
According to director [[Chuck Jones]], this film demonstrated for the first time that animation can create ''characters'' with a recognizable personality, independent of their appearance, [[Social environment|milieu]], or voice. Although [[Bugs Bunny]] (who declares "Ain't I a stinker?") is revealed to be the unseen animator, Jones comments that the ending was just for comedic value: Jones (the director) is speaking to the audience directly, asking "Who is Daffy Duck anyway? Would you recognize him if I did ''this'' to him?  What if he didn't live in the woods? Didn't live anywhere? What if he had no voice? No face? What if he wasn't even a duck anymore?" In all cases, Daffy is still Daffy; not all cartoon characters can claim such distinctive personality.

''Duck Amuck'' is included in the compilation film ''[[The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie]],'' along with other favorite Chuck Jones cartoons including ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''

[[Mel Blanc]] performed the voices. It was directed by Chuck Jones with a story by [[Michael Maltese]]. The film contains many examples of [[self-referential humor]], breaking the [[fourth wall]].

In 1999 the film was deemed "culturally significant" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. This was the second of three animated shorts by Jones to receive this honor (the others are 1957's ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]'' and 1955's ''[[One Froggy Evening]]''). Jones has the distinction of being the only director ({{As of|2006|lc=on}}) with three animated shorts in the registry.

The cartoon's plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, ''[[Rabbit Rampage]]'' (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator ([[Elmer Fudd]]). A similar plot was also included in the episode "Duck's Reflucks" of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]],'' in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. It is done once again with Daffy tormenting Bugs in the ''[[New Looney Tunes]]'' episode "One Carroter in Search of an Artist" (for this reason, this version has garnered the alternative name "Rabbit Rampage II" among series fans) with the technology updated and the pencil and paintbrush replaced by a digital pen.

In issue #94 of the ''Looney Tunes'' comic, Bugs Bunny gets his back at Daffy Duck by making him the victim, in switching various movie roles, from [[Duck Twacy]] in ''Who Killed Daffy Duck''," a video game character, and a talk show host, and they always wind up with Daffy starring in ''[[Moby Dick]]'' (the story's running gag). After this, Bugs comments, "Eh, dis guy needs a new agent."

'''''Enigma''''' is a 2001 [[Spy film|espionage thriller]] film directed by [[Michael Apted]] from a screenplay by [[Tom Stoppard]]. The script was adapted from the novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], about the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] codebreakers of [[Bletchley Park]] in the [[Second World War]].

Although the story is highly fictionalised, the process of encrypting German messages during World War II and decrypting them with the Enigma is discussed in detail, and the historical event of the [[Katyn massacre]] is highlighted. It was the last film scored by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].

==Plot==
The story, loosely based on actual events, takes place in March 1943, when the [[Second World War]] was at its height. The [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] at [[Bletchley Park]], [[Buckinghamshire]], have a problem: the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[U-boat]]s have changed one of their code reference books used for [[Enigma machine]] [[cipher]]s, leading to a blackout in the flow of vital naval [[signals intelligence]]. The British cryptanalysts have cracked the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#M4 (German Navy 4-rotor Enigma)|"Shark" cipher]] once before, and they need to do it again in order to keep track of U-boat locations.

The film begins with Tom Jericho returning to Bletchley after a month recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by his failed love affair with a coworker named Claire Romilly. Jericho immediately seeks to see her again and finds that she mysteriously disappeared a few days earlier. He enlists the help of Claire's housemate, Hester Wallace, to follow the trail of clues and learn what has happened to Claire.

Mr. Jericho and Miss Wallace, as they formally address each other, work to decipher intercepts stolen by Claire and determine why she took them. Jericho is closely watched by an [[MI5]] agent, Wigram ([[Jeremy Northam]]), who plays [[cat and mouse]] with him throughout the film. Meanwhile, U-boats are closing in on a convoy of thirty seven ships from America, giving the code-breakers less than four days to find a solution to reading the changed Shark cipher.

But someone else at Bletchley has a personal interest in the stolen intercepts, and may be responsible for Claire's disappearance.

==Production and premiere==
[[File:BletcleyPark SubModel.JPG|thumb|The scaled-down model of a Second World War U-boat used in the film. The model was donated to the [[Bletchley Park]] museum.]]
The film was shot on location in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Netherlands]], with Bletchley Park mansion substituted by [[Chicheley Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Sleeve notes from DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; Other locations include the [[Great Central Railway]], [[Loughborough]] and Tigh Beg Croft, near [[Oban]], Scotland. Interiors were filmed at [[Elstree Film Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157583/locations IMDb: ''Locations for Enigma''] Retrieved 2013-04-01&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was produced by [[Mick Jagger]] of [[the Rolling Stones]]. Jagger makes a cameo appearance as an RAF officer at a dance. He also lent the film's design department a four-rotor Enigma encoding machine he owned to ensure the historical accuracy of one of the props. The festivities around the London premiere of the film are shown in the 2001 documentary ''[[Being Mick]]''.

==Reception==
[[File:Sunbeam Talbot 2 litre Sports Tourer 1947.jpg|thumb|The Sunbeam-Talbot 2-litre driven by the character Tom Jericho in the film]]
Critical reviews were largely positive, but there was criticism of the largely fictional storyline, which neither mentions the real codebreaker, [[Alan Turing]], nor gives due credit to the Polish cryptanalysis foundation, the [[Biuro Szyfrów]] (Cipher Bureau). The film holds a 'fresh' 72% rating on review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the consensus reading, 'The well-crafted, twist-filled Enigma is a thinking person's spy thriller.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1113649-enigma/|title=Enigma|date=19 April 2002|website=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Leydon of [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] compared the film to works by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and remarked that, 'Overall, "Enigma" plays fair and square while generating suspense with its twisty plot. And while it requires a generous suspension of disbelief to accept a few action-hero gestures by the deeply troubled Jericho, Scott is persuasive and compelling enough as his complex character to drive the narrative.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/markets-festivals/enigma-2-1200466247/|title=Review: ‘Enigma’|first=Joe|last=Leydon|date=24 January 2001|website=Variety.com|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars and said, 'What I like about the movie is its combination of suspense and intelligence. If it does not quite explain exactly how decryption works (how could it?), it at least gives us a good idea of how decrypters work, and we understand how crucial Bletchley was—so crucial its existence was kept a secret for 30 years.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/enigma-2002|title=Enigma Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2002) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other end, [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was far less impressed, saying, 'The legend of how the British cracked the almighty Enigma must have sounded, on paper, like a nifty mathematical thriller—a historic WarGames set at the formative moment of the computer age. On screen, however, Enigma plays as if the scriptwriter, Tom Stoppard, and the director, Michael Apted, were themselves cryptographers; they seem to be making hunt-and-peck stabs at how to translate a tale of arcane numeric formulas into drama.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2002/05/03/enigma|title=Enigma |website=Ew.com|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
The film and, by association, the book have attracted criticism for their portrayal of the Polish role in [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[decryption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmweb.pl/Norman%20Davies%20oskar%C5%BCa%20%22Enigm%C4%99%22,News,id=3946|title=Norman Davies oskarża "Enigmę"|website=Filmweb.pl|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Norman Davies]] argues that in the film the fictitious traitor turns out to be Polish, but only slight mention is made of the contributions of prewar Polish [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] [[cryptologist]]s to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] Enigma decryption efforts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8158782.stm|title=How Poles cracked Nazi Enigma secret|author=Peter, Laurence | publisher= [[BBC News]]|accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but historically, the only known traitor active at Bletchley Park was British spy [[John Cairncross]], who passed crucial secrets to the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/09/99/britain_betrayed/444058.stm | title=Britain betrayed: The Cambridge spy ring | publisher=BBC News | date=September 13, 1999 | accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film hints that [[Dougray Scott]]’s character the brilliant Cambridge mathematician Thomas Jericho is the main code-breaker at [[Bletchley Park|Bletchley]], equating him with [[Alan Turing]], the original creator of the British [[Bombe]], with the words of Mr Wigram, played by [[Jeremy Northam]]:
“But what if someone tells them just how we do do it? Your thinking machine, clackity-clack, day and night, programmed with a menu, thanks to your big brain, that reduces the odds to just a few million-to-one until it locks on to the winning combination. There goes the war…”
Of course Jericho is a totally fictional character, given that Turing was homosexual and only had a platonic relationship with his short-lived fiancé [[Joan Clarke]], who knew about his sexual orientation. In reality it was unlikely that Turing was involved in code-breaking the Naval four-rotor Enigma Shark in 1943. Notes by [[Tony Sale]] do not mention Turing as the “someone in Bletchley Park [who] realised that Short Weather Signals were sent in the three wheel mode” and explained “the Central Met. Station had collated the U-Boat and other reports, [and] they broadcast a general synoptic in their own Met. Code”, which used the standard International Met. Code further encoded using bigram tables, as discovered by Mr Archer from the Met. section of Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/navenigma/navenig9.htm ''Breaking Shark on the Short Weather Signals'' - The Breaking of German Naval Enigma by Tony Sale] Retrieved 25 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], from June 1943 Joan Clarke, Mahon, Pendered and Noskwith, were responsible for the whole of the cryptographic work until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turing.org.uk/book/update/part5.html ''Update to Alan Turing: the Enigma by Andrew Hodges Part 5: Running Up'', Turing.org] Retrieved 25 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Strangely Joan Clarke is not present in the film as none of the team of [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] are female.

In the film Cave, from Naval Intelligence, played by [[Matthew Macfadyen]], mentioned Fasson and Grazier gave their lives to rescue the code books from a sinking submarine. There were actually three men who retrieved the books: [[Tony Fasson|First Lieutenant Anthony Fasson]], [[Colin Grazier|Able Seaman Colin Grazier]] and 16-year old [[Tommy Brown (NAAFI assistant)|Tommy Brown]] from the canteen. Fasson and Grazier did drown while attempting to retrieve electrical equipment from U Boat [[German submarine U-559|U-559]] (which Cave describes as its four-rotor enigma) on 30 October 1942, while Brown survived only to die in a house fire during shore-leave before the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/navenigma/navenig8.htm ''The Documents recovered from U559 - at a price'', The Breaking of German Naval Enigma by Tony Sale] Retrieved 25 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/enigma-code-u-boat-u559-hms-petard-sebag-montefiori ''The boarding of U-559 changed the war – now both sides tell their story'', The Guardian, 21 Oct 2017] Retrieved 25 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/teen-who-rescued-enigma-codes-9707940 ''Teen who rescued Enigma codes from sinking sub died in house fire without knowing the significance of his bravery'', The Mirror, 27 Jan 2017] Retrieved 25 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Fasson and Grazier were awarded the [[George Cross]] posthumously and Brown was awarded the [[George Medal]].&lt;ref name=NAVAL_ENIGMA&gt;[https://uboat.net/technical/enigma_breaking.htm ''Allied Breaking of Naval Enigma'', uboat.net] Retrieved 25 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Fictional character Cave states he was completing his last posting on a destroyer, in November ’42, when the books were acquired.

There are historical records of the break in the ability of the British to decode the Naval enigma from 10 to 19 March 1943 when the third edition of the weather short signal codebook was deployed&lt;ref name=NAVAL_ENIGMA /&gt;.

The [[Katyn massacre]], revealed after the discovery of mass graves of 4,500 Polish officers as depicted in the film, is a historical atrocity committed by Stalinist Russia in 1940. There is no evidence that details of the mass graves were intercepted by British intelligence, although it is possible. The first announcement of the discovery was broadcast by Radio Berlin on 13 April 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/world-war-two-and-eastern-europe/the-katyn-wood-massacre/ ''The Katyn Wood Massacre'', C N Trueman, The History Learning Site, 18 May 2015] Retrieved 25 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1983">'''''For the Liberation of Brazil''''' is a [[Marxist]] tract on [[guerrilla warfare]] written by [[Carlos Marighella]].  First published in France as ''Carlos Marighela: Pour la Libération du Brésil'' presented by [[Conrad Detrez]], [[Editions du Seuil]], 1970.  In March 1970 the ''[[Journal officiel de la République française|Journal Official]]'' announced that the sale and distribution of the book throughout French territory would be forbidden.

It was then published in English by [[Penguin Books]] in 1971 as part of their "[[Pelican Latin American Library]]" series and with more material than the French version. This edition was translated by [[John Butt (translator)|John Butt]] and [[Rosemary Sheed]] with an introduction by [[Richard Gott]] (pp. 7-15).

The first part of the book provides a timeline of events that includes actions taken by the [[Revolutionary Movement 8th October]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13279">The '''Fortune Global 500''', also known as '''Global 500''', is an annual ranking of the top 500 [[corporation]]s worldwide as measured by [[revenue]] and the list is compiled and published annually by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine.

== Methodology ==
Until 1989, it listed only non-[[United States]] industrial corporations under the title "International 500" while the [[Fortune 500]] contained and still contains exclusively United States corporations. In 1990, United States companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales. Since 1995, the list has had its current form, listing also top financial corporations and service providers by revenue.

=== Controversy ===
Several inconsistencies exist in Fortune's ranking of cities with the most Fortune 500 headquarters. On June 3, 2011, the ''[[Atlanta Business Chronicle]]'' stated examples of ''Fortune'' including regional headquarters for some cities, not including regional headquarters for other cities and in some cases not including headquarters that are physically located inside a city limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some cities rankings are overstated|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/print-edition/2011/06/03/fortune-500-list-overstates-atlantas.html|author=Maria Saporta|publisher=Atlanta Business Chronicle|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical distribution ==
Since 2001, there has been a significant change in the geographical distribution of the companies in the Global 500 rankings. The number of [[North America]]n-based companies decreased from 215 in 2001 to 143 in 2017{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} and the contribution of [[Asia]]n-based companies increased rapidly from 116 in 2001 to 197 in 2017{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Most of this growth is accounted for by the rapid increase in the number of Chinese Global 500 companies, of which there were 109 by 2017, increasing from only 10 in 2001. The share of [[Europe]]an-based companies also reduced, from 158 to 143, over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/|title=A New Perspective on the Corporate World|accessdate=8 July 2013|publisher=CNN Money, Fortune Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.fortune.com/global500/visualizations/?iid=recirc_g500landing-zone1|title=Visualize The Global 500|website=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/40-of-fortune-500-companies-asian-india-has-7-in-list/articleshow/59707630.cms Fortune 500 companies list: 40% of Fortune 500 companies Asian, India has 7 in list - Times of India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; The Global 500 includes [[Unilever]] under the heading "Britain/Netherlands", as the company is counted in the tally for both countries.

As shown in the table above, 428 (86%) of the Global 500 are represented by only 10 countries: two in North America (Canada and United States), five in Western Europe (France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland and United Kingdom) and three in East Asia (China, Japan and South Korea). Moreover, the top six (United States, China, Japan, Germany, France and United Kingdom) are the world's largest economies as estimated by the IMF ([[List of countries by GDP (nominal)]]). Among the Global 500, 371 companies (74.2%) are from these six countries.

'''''Friendly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America''''' is a [[book]] written by American [[social scientist]] and professor of [[political science]] at [[Hunter College]] [[Bertram Myron Gross|Bertram Gross]] and published on June 1, 1980 by M. Evans &amp; Company as a 419-page hardback book containing 440 quotations and sources. The book examines the history of [[fascism]] and based on the growth of [[big business]] and [[big government]] describes [[Scenario planning|possible political scenarios]] for a [[Futures studies|future United States]].&lt;ref name="NYBOOKS-19801023"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJLS-1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EM-DWharton"/&gt; According to a 1981 review in the journal [[Social Justice (journal)|''Social Justice'']], the book is described as "timely" on a subject requiring serious consideration and is about the dangers of fascism, focusing primarily on the United States, but being aware that [[monopoly capitalism]] needs to be understood internationally since [[capitalism]] "is not a national [[mode of production]]".&lt;ref name="SJ-1981"/&gt;

In 2016, the book prompted the following response right after [[Donald Trump]] was elected [[President of the United States]]: "The next wave of fascists will not come with [[Stock car (rail)|cattle cars]] and [[Internment|concentration camps]], but they'll come with a [[Smiley|smiley face]] and maybe a [[Television show|TV show]]. [...] That’s how the 21st-century fascists will essentially take over".&lt;ref name="HP-20161114" /&gt;

== Reactions ==
According to [[Jason Epstein]], editor, publisher and book reviewer for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', "''Friendly Fascism'' [...] reflects what seems to be a widespread feeling among [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] as well as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] that [[democracy]] in America has played itself out: that soon Americans won’t be able to govern themselves".&lt;ref name="NYBOOKS-19801023"&gt;{{cite news |last=Epstein |first=Jason |authorlink=Jason Epstein |title=Is the Party Over? |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1980/10/23/is-the-party-over/ |date=October 23, 1980 |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |accessdate=September 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gaddis Smith]], professor emeritus of history at [[Yale University]] and an expert on American [[International relations|foreign relations]], the book is an "insightful lament over the growth of centralized power by business and government in alliance under the direction of faceless managers who [...] are replacing democracy with a form of benevolent fascism".&lt;ref name="FA-19800901"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Gaddis |authorlink=Gaddis Smith |title=Friendly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America (capsule review) |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1980-09-01/friendly-fascism-new-face-power-america |date=September 1, 1980 |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=September 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing on behalf of ''[[Eclectica Magazine]]'', reviewer Dale Wharton comments that the book offers "faint hope of averting [[neofascism]]", but as a possible offset suggests raising aspirations, notably by "setting forth clear lofty goals, broad enough to embrace a great majority". Help may come from insiders since "bubbling upward from all levels of the [[The Establishment|Establishment]] are longings for fulfilling [[employment]] disconnected from [[Consumerism|consumer exploitation]], [[environmental degradation]], or [[militarism]]".&lt;ref name="EM-DWharton"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wharton |first=Dale |title=A review by Dale Wharton: Frienndly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America by Bertram Gross |url=http://www.eclectica.org/v1n1/reviews/wharton_friendly.html |date= |work=[[Eclectica Magazine]] |accessdate=September 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reviewer Dennis Phillips notes in the ''Australian Journal of Law &amp; Society'' that Gross wrote ''Friendly Fascism'' before [[Ronald Reagan]] had become [[President of the United States]], but Reagan's United States, presumed in part to be a result of neofascist techniques described in the book, had "proven Bertram Gross to be an amazingly astute prophet .

==G-Music Chart==

The G-Music Chart was first officially published on July 7, 2005, and compiled the top physically sold CD releases in Taiwan (including both albums and physically released singles). Only the top 20 positions are published, and instead of sales, a percentage ranking is listed next to each release. For example, in the 52nd week of 2006, ''[[Born to Love (Mayday album)|Born to Love]]'', ranked at number one, sold 25.46% of the CDs sold in Taiwan that week. G-Music's main chart, '''Combo Chart''' (Chinese: 綜合榜 ''zònghé bǎng''), ranks all music sales, regardless of language, country of origin or genre.

===Sub charts===

In addition to the main chart, there are eight sub-charts, and one defunct chart. All charts feature a percentage ranking, which is the percentage sold for each subcategory. All charts began on the same day as the Combo Chart, July 7, 2005. The currently operating sub-charts are:

*''Mandarin Chart'' (Chinese: 華語榜 ''Huáyǔ bǎng'') ranks releases in Chinese language.
*''Western Chart'' (Chinese: 西洋榜 ''Xīyáng bǎng'') ranks predominantly English releases from [[North America]], [[Europe]] or other Western countries.
*''J-Pop Chart'' (Chinese: 東洋榜 ''Dōngyáng bǎng'', "East Asian Chart") ranks non-Chinese Asian language albums. Originally named for [[Japanese language|Japanese]] releases, the chart increasingly features musicians singing in [[Korean language|Korean]].
*''Jazz Chart'' (Chinese: 爵士榜 ''Juéshì bǎng'') ranks [[jazz]] releases, regardless of nationality or language.
*''Classical Chart'' (Chinese: 古典榜 ''Gǔdiǎn bǎng'') ranks classical music releases, regardless of nationality or language.
*''Audio/Video Chart'' (Chinese: 影音榜 ''Yǐngyīn bǎng'') ranks music-related DVD and Blu-ray releases, regardless of nationality, language or genre.
*''International Chart'' (Chinese: 外語榜 ''Wàiyǔ bǎng'') combines the Western Chart and J-Pop Chart together

In addition to these, a Taiwanese singles chart called the ''Top Chinese Chart'' (Chinese: 百事榜 ''Bǎishì bǎng'', "[[Pepsi]] Chart"), also called the "[[Mengniu Dairy]] Chart" (蒙牛榜 ''Méngniú bǎng''), was created at the start of 2006. It ranked the top songs in two different top 20 charts: one for [[Mainland China]] (内地榜單 ''Nèidì bǎngdān'') and one combining [[Hong Kong]] and Taiwan (港臺榜單 ''Gǎng-tái bǎngdān''). The chart was made defunct in September 2008.

'''The Harleian Society''' is a [[text publication society]] and [[registered charity]] founded in 1869 for the publication of manuscripts of the [[heraldic visitation]]s of the counties of England and Wales, and other unpublished manuscripts relating to [[genealogy]], [[Armory (heraldry)|armory]], and [[heraldry]] in its widest sense. Since its inception, the Society has published more than 90 volumes of [[parish register]]s, 54 volumes of heraldic visitations, and 70 volumes drawn from other sources. 

The Society's publications are available by [[subscription business model|subscription]].

The Society was named after the [[Harleian Collection|Harleian Manuscripts]], originally accumulated by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford]], and his son [[Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford]], and now held in the [[British Library]], which include many copies of heraldic visitations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8461">In the field of [[IPv6 deployment]], '''IPv6 brokenness''' was bad behavior seen in early [[IPv6#Dual IP stack implementation#Tunneling|tunneled]] or [[IPv6#Dual IP stack implementation|dual stack]] [[IPv6]] deployments where unreliable or bogus IPv6 connectivity is chosen in preference to working IPv4 connectivity. This often resulted in long delays in [[web page]] loading, where the user had to wait for each attempted IPv6 connection to [[timeout (computing)|time out]] before the IPv4 connection was tried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20101012_ipv6_and_the_fear_of_brokenness/|title=IPv6 and the Fear of Brokenness|author=Yves Poppe|publisher=CircleID|date=Oct 12, 2010|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These timeouts ranged from being near-instantaneous in the best cases, to taking anywhere between four seconds to three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog50/presentations/Wednesday/NANOG50.Talk41.colitti-IPv6%20transition%20experiences.pdf|title=IPv6 transition experiences|author=Lorenzo Colitti, Google|accessdate=2010-12-29}} presented at NANOG 50&lt;/ref&gt;  

IPv6 brokenness is now generally regarded as a solved problem for almost all practical purposes, following improvements at both the transport and application layers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Brokenness ==

As of May 2011, IPv6 brokenness as measured by instrumenting a set of mainstream Norwegian websites was down to ~0.015%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fud.no/ipv6/|title=IPv6 dual-stack client loss in Norway|author=Tore Anderson|accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which was caused by older versions of [[Mac OS X]] which would often prefer non-working IPv6 connectivity when it was not justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ripe61.ripe.net/presentations/162-ripe61.pdf|title=Measuring and combating IPv6 brokenness|author=Tore Anderson|accessdate=2010-12-29}}, presented at RIPE 61, Rome, November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
This behavior was fixed in Mac OS X 10.6.5, and is likely to decline further as Mac OS X 10.6.5 and subsequent versions roll out to a wider audience. However, there was no upgrade path for [[PowerPC]]-based Macs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/11/apple-fixes-broken-ipv6-by-breaking-it-some-more.ars|title=Apple fixes broken IPv6 by breaking it some more|publisher=Ars Technica|author=Iljitsch van Beijnum|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main remaining problem for Mac OS X was the presence of rogue routers, such as wrongly configured Windows [[Internet Connection Sharing]] devices pretending to have IPv6 connectivity, while 6to4 tunneled IPv6 traffic is blocked at a firewall.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Another problem was pre-10.50 versions of Opera.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Following [[World IPv6 Day]] in July 2011, there were reports of a substantial reduction in IPv6 brokenness as a result of that experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/072711-ipv6-brokenness.html|title='IPv6 brokenness' problem appears fixed|author=Carolyn Duffy Marsan|publisher=Network World|date=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year following the trial, but prior to the [[World IPv6 Launch]] date, brokenness levels were reported to have risen slowly back upwards again towards 0.03%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57445316-92/internet-powers-flip-the-ipv6-switch-faq/?tag=postrtcol;posts|title=Internet powers flip the IPv6 switch (FAQ)|author=Stephen Shankland|date=June 4, 2012|publisher=CNET News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DNS whitelisting ==
[[Google]], a major provider of services on the Internet, experimented with using a type of '''DNS whitelisting''' on a per-ISP basis to prevent this&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/|title=Google over IPv6|publisher=Google|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2010/03/yahoo-wants-two-faced-dns-to-aid-ipv6-deployment.ars|title=Yahoo wants two-faced DNS to aid IPv6 deployment|author=Iljitsch van Beijnum|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the World IPv6 Launch.  In the DNS whitelisting approach, ISPs are determined from [[DNS lookup]] source IP addresses by correlating them with network prefixes derived from [[routing table]]s. There is an [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-livingood-dns-whitelisting-implications IETF draft] entitled "IPv6 AAAA DNS Whitelisting Implications" that describes the issues around whitelisting. AAAA records are only sent to ISPs that can demonstrate that they are providing reliable IPv6 to their customers. Other ISPs are sent only A records, thus preventing users from attempting to connect over IPv6. 

Numerous concerns were been raised about the practicality of DNS whitelisting as a long-term large-scale solution, such as scalability and maintenance issues relating to the maintenance of large numbers of bilateral agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/79/slides/dnsop-1.pdf|title=IPv6 DNS Whitelisting &amp;mdash; Overview and Implications|author=Jason Livingood|date=October 2010|publisher=Comcast|accessdate=2010-12-29}}, presented at IETF79, Beijing&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, several of the major web service providers met to discuss pooling their DNS whitelisting information in an attempt to avoid these scaling problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.techworld.com/networking/3218712/google-microsoft-and-yahoo-talk-about-ipv6-whitelist/|title=Google, Microsoft and Yahoo talk about IPv6 whitelist|publisher=Techworld|date=29 March 2010|author=Carolyn Duffy Marsan|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problem resolution ==
It appears that no major content providers eventually ended up using the whitelisting approach, given that all that had previously declared an interest began serving AAAA records to generic DNS queries following [[World IPv6 Launch Day]].

As of 2017, IPv6 brokenness is now generally regarded as a non-problem. This is due to two factors: firstly, IPv6 transport is much improved, so that the underlying error rate is much reduced, and secondly, that common applications such as web browsers now use fast fallback methods such as the "[[Happy Eyeballs]]" algorithm to select whichever protocol works best.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2179639/lan-wan/-ipv6-brokenness--problem-appears-fixed.html|title='IPv6 brokenness' problem appears fixed|last=Marsan|first=Carolyn Duffy|newspaper=Network World|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some operating system vendors have rolled fast fallback algorithms into their higher-level [[Protocol stack|network stack]] APIs, thus making the solution available for all programs that use those APIs to make connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/08/world-ipv6-day-leads-to-browsers-resistant-to-ipv6-brokenness/|title=In wake of World IPv6 Day, browsers resist IPv6 brokenness—but should they?|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6742">'''Lichtenberg's Avertissement''', written by [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]], is a poster intended to deter the citizens of [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]], from attending the performance of [[Jacob Philadelphia]] in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society]]|issue=16 |page=80 |year=1907 |publisher=American Jewish Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was supposed to be an exhibition of scientific experiments; however, Lichtenberg considered it to be a [[magic (illusion)|magic]] show. He was angered by the alleged deception and posted the following [[satire]] in order to persuade people to avoid the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Christopher | first = Milbourne | title = Magic, a Picture History | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-486-26373-8 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the extravagant claims that were posted, Philadelphia left Göttingen without giving any exhibitions.

==Text==
The Avertissement reads as follows:

''Warning''

All fanciers of [[supernatural]] [[physics]] will, by this poster, be made known that a few days ago, the world-famous [[Magician (illusion)|magician]] Philadelphus Philadelphia, who has been mentioned by [[Cardanus]] in his book on the [[nature]] of the supernatural by calling him the envy of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]], has arrived here on the ordinary mail coach, although it would have been equally easy for him to have come through the air. He is the same person who, in 1482, in an open marketplace in [[Venice]], cast a coil of twine into the air and climbed up until he was no longer seen. Beginning on the ninth of January of this year, he will present, openly and secretly, to the public's eyes, his one-[[Thaler]] tricks in the local department store. The tricks will improve every week until he finally arrives at the 500 [[Louis d'Or]] tricks, among which are those that can be said, without boasting, to surpass the wonderful itself, and be even, so to say, virtually impossible. He had the graciousness to perform these same tricks to great applause before all of the high [[potentate]]s in all four parts of the world. He even performed in the fifth part of the world a few weeks ago for her majesty Queen [[Purea|Oberea]] of [[Tahiti]].

He can be seen here every day, at all hours, except not on Mondays and Thursdays, when he expels melancholy thoughts at the venerable [[Congress]] of his countrymen in Philadelphia. Also, not from 11 a.m. to 12 noon because he is engaged in [[Constantinople]], and not from 12 noon to 1 p.m., when he lunches.

From the one-Thaler, common, everyday tricks, we want to indicate some, but not the best. Rather, we'll refer to those that can be described in a few words.

1)	He removes, without leaving the room, the weather cock from the [[St. Jacobi]] church (Göttingen) and sets it on top of the [[St. Johannis (Göttingen)|St. Johannis]] church (Göttingen). On the other hand, he puts the flag from the St. Johannis church on the St. Jacobi church. After they have been there for a few minutes, he brings them back to their proper places. Note: everything is done without [[magnet]]s, through mere speed.

2)	He takes two ladies from the audience, positions them with their heads on the table and lets them turn their legs upward. Then, he pushes them so that they, with unbelievable speed, twist themselves like curls, without damage to their head dress or the respectability of the alignment of their dresses, to the greatest satisfaction of all present.

3)	He takes six half-[[ounce]]s of the best [[arsenic]], grinds it, and cooks it in two cans of [[milk]]. He then treats it to the ladies. As soon as they become sick, he gives them two or three spoonfuls of melted [[lead]] to drink. The audience then becomes cheerful and breaks out in laughter.

4)	He takes an [[axe]] and strikes a [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] with it. The bonnet falls to the ground as though it is dead. On the ground, he gives it a second blow. The bonnet then rises immediately and asks, in a general way: "What music is that?" In other respects, it is in as good condition as before.

5)	He gently extracts [[teeth]] from three or four ladies, puts the teeth in a bag, and lets the audience carefully shake them. Then he loads them into a small [[cannon]] and fires it at the aforementioned ladies. After this, they all have their teeth again, pure and white.

6)	A [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] trick. He shows that something actually can be and not be at the same time. This requires great preparation and expense, but he performs it for only one Thaler in honor of the [[University]] of Göttingen.

7)	He takes all of the watches, rings, and jewels, as well as gold cash when it is required, from the audience who is present. He then issues everyone an [[IOU (debt)|I.O.U.]]. After this, he throws everything in a suitcase and travels with it to [[Kassel]]. Eight days later, each person tears up their I.O.U.. After it is torn, the watches, rings, and jewelry reappear. He has earned much money with this trick.

Note: This week, he is still in the upper room of the department store. But, in the future, he will be high in the free air over the fountain in the market place. There, whoever pays nothing will see nothing.

Göttingen

January 7, 1777

==Schopenhauer's reference==
Philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] made reference to the sixth trick in his discussion of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] description of the [[antinomy]] (conflict of laws) of pure [[reason]] (''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A406). Schopenhauer wrote: 
{{Quotation|The unanimous assent which the antinomy, on the other hand, has met with, may in the end spring from the fact that some people regard with inward gratification the point where the understanding is really supposed to be brought to a standstill, since it has hit upon something that at the same time is and is not, and accordingly they actually have here before them the sixth trick of Philadelphia in Lichtenberg's broadsheet.|''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, Appendix}}

==Deities==
{{Further|List of thunder gods}}
One of the most classic portrayals of this is of the [[Greek god]] [[Zeus]]. An ancient story is when [[Zeus]] was at war against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], he released his brothers, [[Hades]] and [[Poseidon]], along with the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]]. In turn, the Cyclopes gave Zeus the thunderbolt as a weapon, which was near the beginning of Zeus himself. The thunderbolt became a popular symbol of Zeus and continues to be today. He used the thunderbolt to destroy Kayla the goddess.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In [[Slavic mythology]] the highest god of the pantheon is [[Perun]], the god of thunder and lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/438957583|title=Božanski boj : tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine|last=Radoslav.|first=Katičić,|date=2008|publisher=Ibis Grafika|isbn=9789536927418|location=Zagreb|oclc=438957583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pērkons]]/[[Perkūnas]] is the common [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] god of thunder, one of the most important deities in the Baltic pantheon. In both Latvian and Lithuanian mythology, he is documented as the god of thunder, rain, mountains, oak trees and the sky.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In [[Norse mythology]], [[Thor]] is the god of thunder and the sound of thunder comes from the chariot he rides across the sky. The lightning comes from his hammer [[Mjölnir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viking-mythology.com/items.php|title=Norse Mythology: Items of the Gods and Goddesses|author=Højbjerg, Martin|date=2011–2014|publisher=''Norse Mythology''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521214832/http://viking-mythology.com/items.php|archivedate=May 21, 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=June 17, 2014|quote=Mjölnir is one of the most fearsome weapons, capable of leveling mountains. Thor's hammer can hit any target. After the target is hit, the hammer will return to Thor's right hand all by itself. The hammer can send out lightning bolts.|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Finnish mythology]], [[Ukko]] (engl. ''Old Man'') is the god of thunder, sky and weather. The Finnish word for thunder is ''ukkonen'', derived from the god's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suomalainen mytologia|last=Haavio|first=Martti|publisher=WSOY|year=1967|location=Porvoo Helsinki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Judaism]], a blessing "...He who does acts of creation" is to be recited, upon sighting lightning. The Talmud refers to the Hebrew word for the sky, ("Shamaim") – as built from fire and water ("Esh Umaim"), since the sky is the source of the inexplicable mixture of "fire" and water that come together, during rainstorms. This is mentioned in various prayers&lt;ref&gt;i.e. In the prayer for rain, The angel that fought Jacob was a rainstorm "minister angel, mixed of fire and water". Other examples: Extra recitings for 2nd day of Passover, and many more. See for example [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%A9%D7%A7%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9 Hebrew book Shekel Aish discussing lightning].&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed in writings of [[Kabbalah]].

In [[Islam]], the Quran states: "He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and raiseth the heavy clouds. The thunder hymneth His praise and (so do) the angels for awe of Him. He launcheth the thunder-bolts and smiteth with them whom He will." (Qur'an 13:12–13) and, "Have you not seen how God makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a stack, and then you see the rain come out of it..." (Quran, 24:43). The preceding verse, after mentioning clouds and rain, speaks about hail and lightning, "...And He sends down hail from mountains (clouds) in the sky, and He strikes with it whomever He wills, and turns it from whomever He wills."

In [[India]], the [[Hindu]] god [[Indra]] is considered the god of rains and lightning and the king of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In Japan, the [[Shinto]] god [[Raijin]] is considered the god of lightning and thunder. He is depicted as a demon who strikes a drum to create lightning.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In the traditional religion of the African [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes, such as the [[Baganda]] and [[Banyoro]] of [[Uganda]], lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods. The Baganda specifically attribute the lightning phenomenon to the god [[Kiwanuka]], one of the main trio in the [[Lubaale]] gods of the sea or lake. Kiwanuka starts wild fires, strikes trees and other high buildings, and a number of shrines are established in the hills, mountains and plains to stay in his favor. Lightning is also known to be invoked upon one's enemies by uttering certain chants, prayers, and making sacrifices.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Ceraunoscopy ==

[[Ceraunoscopy]] is divination by observing lightning or by listening to thunder.&lt;ref name=wordinfocerauno&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordinfo.info/unit/418 |title=cerauno-, kerauno- + (Greek: thunderbolt, thunder, lightning) |work=WordInfo.com|accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[aeromancy]]. People have also sought to control lightning by conducting rituals or casting spells.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9037">This is a list of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] general election manifestos since the nascent party first put forward candidates at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900 general election]].   From its foundation, general election manifestos were issued for the Labour Party as a whole, whereas the manifestos of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties generally took the form of a form of a short personal address by the leader of the party until the 1950s.

The '''Louvre-Lens''' is an art museum located in [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais]], [[Northern France]], approximately 200 kilometers north of [[Paris]]. It displays objects from the collections of the [[Musée du Louvre]] that are lent to the gallery on a medium- or long-term basis. The Louvre-Lens annex is part of an effort to provide access to French cultural institutions for people who live outside of Paris.&lt;ref name=sanaa&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrative Transparency: Louvre-Lens by SANAA and Tim Culbert  |url=http://www.detail-online.com/architecture/news/integrative-transparency-louvre-lens-by-sanaa-020580.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114021348/http://www.detail-online.com/architecture/news/integrative-transparency-louvre-lens-by-sanaa-020580.html |archivedate=14 January 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the museum maintains close institutional links with the Louvre, it is primarily funded by the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region.&lt;ref name=post2009&gt;{{cite news|title= New Louvre museum in Lens, France, aims to revitalize mining town |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/11/AR2009121100124.html |work=The Washington Post |first=Angela |last=Doland |date=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Because of criticism that French art and culture is limited to [[Paris]],&lt;ref name=mining&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2243902/Louvre-opens-museum-branch-Lens-run-French-mining-town.html |location=London |work=Daily Mail |title=Art through a Lens: Louvre opens museum branch in run-down French mining town |date=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[French Ministry of Culture|Ministry of Culture]] and the Louvre Directorate launched a plan, in 2003, to build a Louvre satellite museum in one of the 22 [[Regions of France]]. Only the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais|Nord pas de Calais]] applied for the museum and proposed six cities: [[Lille]], [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]], [[Valenciennes]], [[Calais]], [[Béthune]] and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]. In 2004, [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], then [[French Prime Minister]], announced Lens as the recipient city.&lt;ref name=post2009 /&gt;

The museum site was chosen in hopes of reversing the fortunes of the depressed Lens mining community, which was devastated by both [[World Wars]] and the [[Nazi occupation of France|Nazi occupation]], and suffered multiple mining catastrophes including the [[Courrières mine disaster]], the worst in European history, and a 1974 tragedy killing 42 miners.&lt;ref name=post2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=museumzero2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Louvre lands on a coal mine |url=http://museumzero.blogspot.com/2013/05/louvre-lands-on-coal-mine.html |author=Jonathan Price |date= 16 May 2013 |work=MuseumZero}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/28/archives/41-french-coal-miners-killed-by-explosion-and-fire.html |title=41 French Coal Miners Killed by Explosion and Fire |newspaper=The New York Times |date= 28 December 1974 |&lt;!-- author=Special to the New York Times --&gt; |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last mine in Lens closed in 1986, which caused the unemployment rate to rise well above the French national average. "France abandoned us when the coal stopped, and we became a [[ghost town]]", said [[Pas-de-Calais]] president [[Daniel Percheron]].&lt;ref name=adamson2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Louvre comes to poor French city, raising eyebrows |date=4 December 2012 |author=Thomas Adamson |work=Associated Press|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/louvre-comes-poor-french-city-raising-eyebrows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials took inspiration from the economic transformation of the Spanish industrial municipality [[Bilbao]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bilbao Effect |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/09/the-bilbao-effect/302582/ |author=Witold Rybczynski |date=September 2002 |newspaper=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was caused, in part, by the construction of the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] satellite (dubbed the [[Starchitect|"Bilbao effect"]], though some cautioned that the comparison is limited due to the much smaller population of Lens, and its lack of other tourist attractions.&lt;ref name=capps2012&gt;{{cite web|title=With the Louvre-Lens, a Curtain Call for the Bilbao Effect |url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2012/12/louvre-lens-curtain-call-bilbao-effect/4161/ |date=14 December 2012 |author=Kriston Capps |work=City Lab, The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Some Lens locals were critical of the project; they felt that the project to bring culture to their city was "patronizing".&lt;ref name=adamson2012 /&gt; Other critics pointed out that the museum makes no attempt to address Lens's turbulent history or its current economic difficulties.&lt;ref name=museumzero2013 /&gt;

A worldwide design contest was won by Japanese architectural firm [[SANAA]] in collaboration with New York firm Imrey Culbert, French [[landscape architect]] Catherine Mosbach, and [[Museology|museographer]] Studio Adrien Gardère.&lt;ref name=sanaa /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Louvre-Lens Opens Today |url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/buildings/the-louvre-lens-opens-today_o |date=12 December 2012 |author=Deane Madsen |work=Architect Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction company [[Eiffage]] was chosen to construct the Lens-based Louvre branch, ultimately costing 150 million Euro (£121.6 million).&lt;ref name=mining /&gt; The Louvre-Lens Museum, SANAA + Imrey Culbert's first building in France, was awarded the ''[[Prix de l'Équerre d'Argent|Prix d'architecture de l'Equerre d'Argent]]'' for 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amc-archi.com/article/equerre-d-argent-2013-laureat-sanaa-le-louvre-lens,3|title=Équerre d'Argent 2013 / Lauréat - Sanaa - Le Louvre-Lens|last=Séron-Pierre|first=Catherine|date=11 February 2015|work=AMC Archi|access-date=10 March 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French government hopes that the location near the northern border of France will be a draw for English, Belgian, and German tourists.&lt;ref name="mining" /&gt; In addition, the Louvre-Lens is near several World War [[memorials]], including the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial]] in [[Vimy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/memorials/france/vimy|title=Canadian National Vimy Memorial|work=Veterans Affairs Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 15 minutes from the Louvre-Lens.

===Architecture===
[[File :Le hall d'accueil du Louvre Lens (8540784674).jpg |thumb|alt=The reception hall with circular glass rooms|The reception hall]]

The museum is built on a {{Convert|20|hectare|acre|lk=off|abbr=on|adj=on}} mining site that closed in the 1960s. The area is slightly elevated due to filling in of the mine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiloci.com/louvre-lens-by-sanaa/|title=Diagram basis|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103132748/http://archiloci.com/louvre-lens-by-sanaa/|archivedate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make the building blend into the surrounding area, the architects designed a string of five low-profile structures; the central one is square with glass walls and the others are rectangular with polished, aluminum facades that gave a blurry reflection of the surroundings.&lt;ref name="bjerring2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcspace.com/features/sanaa/musee-louvre-lens/|title=Musée Louvre-Lens - SANAA|date=16 May 2013|newspaper=Arcspace.com|author=Eva Bjerring}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, the museum is {{Convert|360|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and contains {{Convert|28,000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of exhibition space.&lt;ref name="sanaa" /&gt;


The design of a central building flanked by two wings mimics the Paris Louvre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The square, central building is the main reception area. It contains several curved glass rooms that contain a cafeteria, bookstore and museum boutique.&lt;ref name="sanaa" /&gt; To the east of the entry hall is the {{Convert|3,000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} Galerie du Temps which houses approximately 200 items from the Paris Louvre collection. The items in the large, open hall are arranged chronologically, from 3,500 BC to the mid-19th century, regardless of style or country of origin.&lt;ref name="bjerring2013" /&gt; Beyond the Galerie du Temps is the Pavillon de Verre which exhibits works from neighboring museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2012/12/04/louvre-lens-by-sanaa-and-imrey-culbert/|title=Louvre Lens by SANAA and Imrey Culbert|date=4 December 2012|newspaper=Dezeen.com|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building to the west of the entry hall is a gallery for temporary exhibits (the Exhibitions Temporaires) and, beyond that, an auditorium. 

[[File: La galerie du Temps (Louvre Lens) (8550665335).jpg |thumb|alt=visitors viewing the exhibits in the gallery|The Gallery du Temps]]

=== Temporary exhibits ===
The Exhibitions Temporaires is dedicated to exhibits which last 3 months. The first exhibition, titled ''Renaissance'', included Leonardo da Vinci's recently restored ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo)|The Virgin and Child with St. Anne]].'' The second exhibit was dedicated to [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and included 170 of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.louvrelens.fr/rubens-et-l-europe |title=Rubens et l'Europe - Louvre-Lens |archivedate=8 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308062524/http://www.louvrelens.fr/rubens-et-l-europe |accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inauguration, opening and visitors==
On Dec 4, 2012, President [[François Hollande]], alongside first lady [[Valérie Trierweiler]], the Minister of Culture [[Aurélie Filippetti]], the director of Le Louvre [[Henri Loyrette]], the mayor of Lens [[Guy Delcourt (politician)|Guy Delcourt]], and former prime ministers [[Lionel Jospin]] and [[Pierre Mauroy]] officially opened the Louvre-Lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20121204-lens-musee-louvre-culture-nord-pas-de-calais-inauguration-francois-hollande |title=Lens inaugure son musée du Louvre |date=4 December 2012 |work=France24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following weekend, the museum welcomed its first visitors; three weeks after the opening, the museum welcomed its 100,000th visitor. In May 2013, during [[Long Night of Museums|Long Night of Museums 2013]], 500,000 visitors viewed the masterpieces displayed in the Louvre-Lens Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2012/12/28/succes-pour-le-louvre-lens-trois-semaines-apres-son-inauguration_1811241_3246.html |title=Succès pour le Louvre-Lens, trois semaines après son inauguration |newspaper=Lemonde.fr |date=28 Dec 2012  |author= |accessdate= 11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While {{formatnum:700000}} visitors were anticipated for the first year (while admission was free), the year's final tally was approximately {{formatnum:900000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://nord-pas-de-calais.france3.fr/2013/12/01/le-louvre-lens-un-deja-900000-visiteurs-367375.html |title= Le Louvre-Lens a un an : déjà 900 000 visiteurs |publisher= ''[[France 3 Nord-Pas-de-Calais]]'' |author= [[Agence France-Presse]], E.M. |accessdate= 1 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Feb 7 2013, a woman vandalized a major masterpiece of the museum, [[Liberty guiding the people|''Liberty Guiding the People'']], writing "AE911" on it with a black marker, possibly a reference to a group calling itself "Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rfi.fr/culture/20130208-woman-scrawls-911-graffiti-over-delacroix-masterpiece-Louvre |title=Woman scrawls 9/11 graffiti over Delacroix masterpiece in Louvre-Lens |newspaper=En.rfi.fr |date=8 February 2013  |author= |accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting has been fully restored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1656">'''M13486''' ('''MIL-C-13486''' or '''MIL-DTL-13486''') is a frequently used [[United States Military Standard|MIL-SPEC]] wire and a heavy duty vehicle and aircraft electrical cable.  

The MIL-DTL-13486 military specification was last revised in May 2006 and was originally created by the Department of Defense.  The specification typically covers special purpose electrical cables that are heavy-duty for low-tension circuits.  The wire may have either one or two conductors and be either shielded or unshielded.  

M13486 wire has gained popularity in recent years due to its widespread use for all types of military ground vehicles, including tanks, trailers, trucks, and jeeps.  The wire is also used in exposed situations due to its resistance to abrasion, fluids, and weather.  Additionally, the MIL-Spec wire is recognized for possessing superior flexibility at most temperatures.  M13486 is usually fungus resistant.  The wire is typically constructed with a stranded tinned copper conductor, rubber insulating core, inner glass braid and a jacket. 

Popular specifications for M13486 wire include M13486/1, M13486/12, and M13486/14.  
M13486 wire may be on a designated Qualified Products List.

The '''Nathan Hale Homestead''' is a historic home located at 2299 South Street in [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]], [[Connecticut]]. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and was also known as '''Deacon Richard Hale House'''.

[[Connecticut Landmarks]] operates the house a late 18th-century [[historic house museum]], however, they are currently facing an investigation by the attorney general's office into their alleged neglect of the Homestead and its artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theday.com/local-columns/20180303/ex-landmarks-employee-nathan-hale-bible-left-to-rot-in-closet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theday.com/local-columns/20180308/connecticuts-mona-lisa-sits-inside-shuttered-landmarks-house&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Nathan Hale}}

Nathan Hale was a spy for the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  A graduate of [[Yale]], he taught school for two years, first in [[East Haddam, Connecticut|East Haddam]], then in [[New London, Connecticut|New London]].

After being captured by the [[Great Britain|British]], Hale reportedly gave a speech stating that his only regret was that he had but one life to give for his country.{{sfn|Seymour| p=xxv}}

After he was hanged, his body was not returned and was never found.  There is a monument to him in a cemetery in his hometown of Coventry, Connecticut.

Nathan Hale is Connecticut's state hero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctlandmarks.org/hale.php Nathan Hale on Connecticut Landmarks website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The House==
Despite the name of the property, Nathan Hale never lived in the house that is named for him.  As a child, he did live in a home that was located in the same spot.  This house was razed by his parents in order to create a larger living space for the family.

News of Nathan's death came when his family grew concerned for his well-being.  His brother traveled from Coventry to [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] to meet with the army and inquire about Nathan's whereabouts.  He was informed that Nathan had been killed and was given a trunk of his belongings.  This trunk is in the house.

After the Hale family, the house was sold to a series of other families who used it as a private residence, and the story of Nathan Hale became forgotten as just another story of a fallen soldier.  However, a Connecticut lawyer named [[George Dudley Seymour]] became fascinated by the story while living in New Haven and was instrumental in the effort to recognize Hale's efforts.  After championing the cause of erecting a statue of Nathan Hale at Yale University, Seymour learned that the farm in Coventry, which had been owned by Nathan's father, the Reverend Deacon Richard Hale, was for sale and in disrepair.  He purchased the property in 1914 and restored the house to its original dignity, furnishing it with Connecticut antiques and artifacts, including Nathan's trunk.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.s560.com/dokuwiki/book:george_dudley_seymour George Dudley Seymour article from Seymour Wiki Genealogy site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he purchased the property across the street.  Named the [[Strong-Porter House]], it was the home of Nathan's grandmother, and is also a museum and on the list of National Registered Historic Places.

In a further effort to recognize Nathan Hale's sacrifice, Seymour also convinced the federal government to print a Nathan Hale postage stamp in 1925.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The stamp was designed by artist [[Bela Lyon Pratt]], who also created the statue of Nathan at [[Fort Nathan Hale]] in New Haven.

==Possible Hauntings==
Seymour was of the belief that the homestead was haunted.  According to a diary entry, he and a friend reportedly viewed the spirit of Reverend Deacon Hale through a window one rainy night.  Also believed to be in residence is the spirit of Lydia Carpenter, a servant of the Hale family, and of Joseph Hale, Nathan's brother.

Mary Elizabeth Campbell Griffith, the widow of a former caretaker of the homestead, believed that the house might have been haunted by John and Sarah Hale, Nathan's brother and sister-in-law.&lt;ref name="NormanScott2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Norman|author2=Beth Scott|title=Haunted heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hb8r2obx1lAC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=17 October 2010|date=18 October 2002|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-7653-0173-4|pages=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Property==
[[File:Nathan Hale Homestead stone marker.JPG|thumb|140px|Stone marker explaining Holy Grove]]
Surrounding the house is the [[Nathan Hale State Forest]], maintained by the [[Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection]].

Next to the house is a corn field that is planted every year.  In October, friends of the Hale Homestead put on a haunted corn maze.

In front of the homestead is a triangular grassy plot of land containing maple trees planted by Nathan's nephew David Hale Junior in 1812.  The area has come to be known as the Holy Grove, in part because neighbors used to hold prayer meetings there.{{sfn|Seymour| p=487}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12894">The '''National Liberation Army''' (abbreviated as '''ELN''', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''''Ejército de Liberación Nacional''''') was a [[Peru]]vian [[guerrilla]] group. It sought to gather militants regardless of their political affiliation. A short-lived movement that was formed in 1962 and carried out numerous small skirmishes and actions culminating in a seven-month peak of militant actions in 1965, the ELN was largely scattered by the [[Peruvian Army]] by December 1965.

==Formation==
{{Rquote|right|When the theoretical basis for [[guerrilla warfare]] as expressed by [[Cuban revolution|Cuban leaders]] and summed up by [[Régis Debray|Debray]] began to circulate in Peru, it only reinforced what many had maintained in practice: first comes action, then the party; the party is born out of the action.|[[Hector Bejar]], 1969&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt;}}
The group had a varied composition that grew to share a "certain disdain of 'politics' and suspicion of any type of party organisation", as well as a few discontent members from the [[Peruvian Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="peru1965"&gt;[[Hector Bejar|Bejar, Hector]], "Peru 1965: Notes on a Guerrilla Experience", [[Monthly Review Press]], 1969&lt;/ref&gt; This new movement included some former members of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Peru)|MIR]] youth branch.

[[Hector Bejar]] [http://www.hectorbejar.com], one of the military commanders of the ELN, later summarised it as an attempt to create a "free association of revolutionaries" and "an army which would draw combatants together regardless of their ideologies or political affiliations".&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt; Following their collapse, Bejar remarked that one of their core mistakes had been not liaising and keeping communications open with larger revolutionary movements that could have supported them as they were attacked by the Peruvian Army; instead, they had opted to believe they could remain self-sufficient and rely on local recruits from the villages and plantations.&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt;

In 1962, the group considered itself under the leadership of Juan Pablo Chang Navarro.&lt;ref name=schmid&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmid|first=Alex Peter|title=Political terrorism: a new guide to actors, authors, concepts, data bases, theories, &amp; literature|year=2005|publisher=9781412804691|isbn=978-1-4128-0469-1|author2=A.J.

==Militant activity==
The ELN formed mobile training groups, desiring to have professional guerrillas sent into the rugged terrain rather than untrained volunteers.&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt; Approximately fifty group members were also believed to be entering southern Peru from [[Bolivia]], after receiving training in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="sword"&gt;[http://www.gci275.com/sword/enemies.shtml Ayacucho gains some important enemies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Confidential Airgram A-751, June 26, 1966, [[USNA]] (Box 2575)&lt;/ref&gt; The group received assistance from the Bolivian [[Rodolfo Saldaña]], who left later that year to fight in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Militant]], [http://www.themilitant.com/2001/6505/650551.html Cuban general Harry Villegas salutes book by Bolivian revolutionary Rodolfo Saldaña], February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
{{rquote|right|'Thru a twist of fate, the government of Peru discovered and smashed a communist conspiracy hatched in Cuba that was designed to set this country aflame with guerrilla warfare, terroristic activities, and sabotage.'|[[Chicago Tribune]], June 24, 1963&lt;ref&gt;[[Chicago Tribune]], "[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/573025222.html?dids=573025222:573025222&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+24%2C+1963&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Fate+Leads+to+Breakup+of+Peruvian+Guerrillas&amp;pqatl=google Fate Leads to Breakup of Peruvian Guerrillas]", June 24, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In January 1963, a group led by the 21-year-old poet Javier Heraud and Alain Elias crossed through Bolivia, where they picked up weapons and entered southern Peru. Plagued by [[Leishmaniasis]] infection, however, the 15-member team decided to enter the city of [[Puerto Maldonado]] on May 15 to seek out medical supplies.&lt;ref name="sword"/&gt;&lt;ref name="movimiento"/&gt;

According to one source, the local police were warned of the group's advance, and captured the six team members who had been sent to the city limits.&lt;ref name="sword"/&gt;&lt;ref name="movimiento"/&gt; According to other sources, the six militants had checked into the local hotel, and a police officer who heard about it went to the hotel to demand identifying documents from the youth. When they refused to show identification, other officers were called and escorted them towards the local prison; one of the guerrillas drew a gun and killed Sgt. Aquilino Sam Jara. The officers returned fire, wounding two of the militants as the others ran off hoping to escape capture.&lt;ref&gt;Einaudi, Luigi R. [http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/2008/P3897.pdf Latin American Student Radicalism], July 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Policia Nacional del Peru, [http://www.pnp.gob.pe/heroes.html Nuestros Heroes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[[TIME]], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896802,00.html Biography of a Lost Poet], May 31, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, Elias, Abraham Lama and Pedro Morote were all captured within days of entering the town.&lt;ref name="sword"/&gt;&lt;ref name="movimiento"/&gt; Heraud was shot in the chest and killed while he drifted past the town in a [[dugout canoe]]. Hector Bejar was one of the few to escape, and it proved difficult for him to rebuild the militant group.&lt;ref name="sword"/&gt;&lt;ref name="movimiento"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Perú (ELN)|url=http://perso.wanadoo.es/guerrillas/movguerrperueln.htm|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, when MIR announced they were beginning militant operations in response to the arrest of [[Hugo Blanco (politician)|Hugo Blanco]] and the accession of the government of [[Fernando Belaunde Terry]],&lt;ref name="historio"&gt;Campbell, Leon G. [http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/peru/peru-guerrilla.pdf The Historiography of the Peruvian Guerrilla Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; the ELN was still not ready to begin operations, but felt pressured to become operational prematurely. It formed the ''Javier Heraud Brigade'' as their main column and moved into the densely forested [[foothill]]s of [[San Miguel Province|San Miguel]] in April.&lt;ref name="sword"/&gt;

In June 1965, the ELN seized the Runateullo [[hacienda]] and destroyed the bridge on the [[Satipo highway]] that led to it, attacked a local mine, and assaulted the {{Interlanguage link multi|Andamarca, Lucanas Province|es|3=Andamarca|lt=Andamarca}} police station.&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt; The group also launched an ambush at [[Yahuarina]], where 17 ELN militants attacked a group of [[Civil Guard (Peru)|Civil Guard]]s, killing nine, wounding nine and taking twelve prisoners (who were later released).&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt; Government officials later claimed there was evidence that the dead had been tortured.&lt;ref&gt;El Comercio, August 3, Page I article&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, Guillermo Lobaton led a group of ELN militants who attacked an Army Ranger encampment, capturing weapons and supplies; it was this action which first publicised the name of the ''Javier Heraud Brigade''.&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt;

On September 25, 1965, the ELN led the seizure of the Chapi hacienda and execution of the two brothers who oversaw the plantation.&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt; The Carillo brothers, who owned the estate which extended over a large area of the [[La Mar Province]], were alleged to have been cruel to their indentured and unpaid workers, frequently whipping and imprisoning them, and, in one January 1963 instance, to have strangled and beheaded a tenant farmer who objected to their seizure of his livestock. Following reports of the death of the brothers, the Civil Guard occupied the plantation to the jeers of the workers.&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt;

==Counterinsurgency by Peruvian Army==
In October, following the overthrow of the Chapi hacienda, the Peruvian Army began a large counterattack aimed at wiping out the ELN. First sending a patrol disguised as militants asking local residents where they could find their comrades, the Army quickly rooted out sympathisers and collaborators. According to the ELN, the locals were tortured and executed.&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt;

As the group was encircled towards the end of 1965, membership dwindled until there were only 13 remaining guerrillas still hiding in the forests together.&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt;

On December 17, the army made substantial contact with the group near [[Tincoj]] and the ensuing firefight left three militants dead, including Edgardo Tello.&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt; Bejar and the remaining militants scattered into the forest and were unable to regroup as they fled the army's advance separately.&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Not every group member's fate is known. Juan Pablo Chang Navarro (known as ''El Chino''), Jose Cabrera Flores (known as ''El Negro'') and Lucio Galvan (known as ''Eustaquio'') were all believed killed in 1967, fighting alongside [[Che Guevara]] in the [[National Liberation Army (Bolivia)|Nancahuazu]].&lt;ref name="peru1965"/&gt; Although one source suggests that Navarro survived, and actually tried to revive the militant movement in 1980 under the same name.&lt;ref name="schmid"/&gt; Their remains are in the Che Guevara's memorial in Santa Clara, Cuba.

American ambassador [[Llewellyn E. Thompson]]  used the 1963 skirmish as evidence that [[Fidel Castro]] was destabilising the hemisphere, in an oral statement to Soviet ambassador [[Anatoliy F. Dobrynin]].&lt;ref&gt;Department of State, [http://www.loyola.edu/departments/academics/political-science/strategic-intelligence/intel/FRUS-6.html Presidential Correspondence: Lot 77 D 163. Secret.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bejar was arrested when he fled to [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] to seek medical treatment due to leishamaniasis; authorities said they surprised him convalescing in a Lima residence.&lt;ref name="sword"/&gt;&lt;ref name=movimiento/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miami News, Tony Solar, "Plan de Castro Para Dispersar los Campesinos", March 3, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; He served five years in prison for [[sedition]] before being pardoned by General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], who took power in 1968, and requested that Bejar work on reforming land policies with the government.&lt;ref name="sword"/&gt;&lt;ref name=movimiento/&gt;

Bejar collaborated with Velasco's Government, being part of SINAMOS, a Government institution for social participation. In the seventies, Bejar and former members of SINAMOS formed CEDEP (Centre for Development and Participation) and was part of the edition committee of 'Socialismo y Participacion' (Socialism and participation), a social sciences journal. Bejar was 'Socialismo y Participacion' editor until its final issue in 2001. Bejar works today as lecturer at [[San Marcos University]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack, Ian. "The Granta Book of Travel".

In 2012, he published 'Mito y Utopia: Relato Alternativo del origen Republicano del Peru' (Myth and Utopia: Alternative story of the Republican Origin of Peru).ACHEBE Ediciones, 2012.

The '''National Library of Australia''' is the largest [[reference library]] in [[Australia]], responsible under the terms of the ''National Library Act'' for "maintaining and developing a national collection of library material, including a comprehensive collection of library material relating to [[Australia]] and the [[Australians|Australian people]]."

==History==
The National Library of Australia, while formally established by the passage of the ''National Library Act 1960'' (Cth), had been functioning as a [[national library]] rather than strictly a Parliamentary Library, almost since its inception.

In 1901, a [[Parliamentary Library of Australia|Commonwealth Parliamentary Library]] was established to serve the newly formed Federal Parliament of Australia. From its inception the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library was driven to development of a truly national collection. In 1907 the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee under the Chairmanship of the Speaker, Sir [[Frederick William Holder]] defined the objective of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library in the following words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Library Committee is keeping before it the ideal of building up, for the time when Parliament shall be established in the Federal Capital, a great Public Library on the lines of the world-famed Library of Congress at Washington; such a library, indeed, as shall be worthy of the Australian Nation; the home of the literature, not of a State, or of a period, but of the world, and of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/collect/burmhist.html |title=NLA.gov.au |publisher=NLA.gov.au |date= |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The present library building was opened on 15 August 1968 by Prime Minister [[John Gorton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Reid, David | author2=National Library of Australia | title=Prime Minister John Gorton addressing officials and dignitaries at the opening of the National Library of Australia, Canberra, 15 August 1968 | publication-date=1968 | publisher=National Library of Australia | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/37987007 | accessdate=13 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=National Library of Australia | author2=White, Harold Leslie Sir, 1905-1992 | title=Publications relating to the opening of the National Library of Australia, 15th August, 1968 | publication-date=1968 | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10631207 | accessdate=13 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by the architectural firm of [[Bunning and Madden]]. The foyer is decorated in marble, with stained-glass windows by [[Leonard French]] and three tapestries by [[Mathieu Matégot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dN028gHIng4C&amp;pg=PA319 |page=319 |title=The Many Lives of Kenneth Myer |author=Sue Ebury |publisher=The Miegunyah Press |year=2008 |ISBN=0-522-85546-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
In 2012–13 the Library collection comprised 6,496,772 items, with an estimated additional 2,325,900 items held in the manuscripts collection.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The Library's collections of [[Australiana]] have developed into the nation's single most important resource of materials recording the Australian cultural heritage.

===Pictures and manuscripts===
[[File:Preserving Archipelagus Orientalis.ogv|thumb|Discussion of the acquisition and preservation process of [[Joan Blaeu]]'s ''Archipelagus Orientalis'' (1663) by the National Library (2013)]]
The National Library holds an extensive collection of pictures and manuscripts. The manuscript collection contains about 26 million separate items, covering in excess of 10,492 meters of shelf space (ACA Australian Archival Statistics, 1998). The collection relates predominantly to Australia, but there are also important holdings relating to [[Papua New Guinea]], [[New Zealand]] and the Pacific. The collection also holds a number of European and Asian manuscript collections or single items have been received as part of formed book collections.

The Australian manuscript collections date from the period of maritime exploration and settlement in the 18th century until the present, with the greatest area of strength dating from the 1890s onwards. The collection includes a large number of outstanding single items, such as the 14th century [[Chertsey]] [[Cartulary]], the journal of [[James Cook]] on the [[HM Bark Endeavour]], inscribed on the Memory of the World&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=21308&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Portal.unesco.org |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=30 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Register in 2001, the diaries of [[Robert O'Hara Burke]] and [[William John Wills]] from the [[Burke and Wills expedition]], and [[Charles Kingsford Smith]]'s and [[Charles Ulm]]'s log of the Southern Cross.

A wide range of individuals and families are represented in the collection, with special strength in the fields of politics, public administration, diplomacy, theatre, art, literature, the pastoral industry and religion. Examples are the papers of [[Alfred Deakin]], [[Sir John Latham]], [[Sir Keith Murdoch]], [[Sir Hans Heysen]], [[Sir John Monash]], [[Vance Palmer]] and [[Nettie Palmer]], [[A.D. Hope]], [[Manning Clark]], [[David Williamson]], [[Billy Hughes|W.M. Hughes]], [[Sir Robert Menzies]], [[Sir William McMahon]], [[Lord Casey]], [[Geoffrey Dutton]], [[Peter Sculthorpe]], [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]], [[Jessie Street]], and [[Eddie Mabo]] and [[James Cook]] both of whose papers were inscribed on [[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] [[Memory of the World Programme]] Register in 2001.&lt;ref name=mowmabo&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mabo Case Manuscripts |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=21311&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |date=16 May 2008 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=11 December 2009 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mowcook&gt;{{cite web |title=The Endeavour Journal of James Cook |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=21308&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |date=16 May 2008 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=11 December 2009 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library has also acquired the records of many national non-governmental organisations. They include the records of the Federal Secretariats of the Liberal party, the [[Australian Labor Party|A.L.P]], the Democrats, the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|R.S.L.]], the [[Australian Inland Mission]], the [[Australian Union of Students]], The [[Australian Ballet]], the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]], the [[Australian Institute of Urban Studies]], [[Australian Industries Protection League]], the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]], and the [[Australian Council of National Trusts]]. Finally, the Library holds about 37,000 reels of [[microfilm]] of manuscripts and archival records, mostly acquired overseas and predominantly of Australian and Pacific interest.

The National Library's Pictures collection focuses on Australian people, places and events, from European exploration of the South Pacific to contemporary events. Art works and photographs are acquired primarily for their informational value, and for their importance as historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/collection-development-policy/pictures |title=National Library of Australia – Pictures Collection Development Policy |publisher=nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media represented in the collection include photographs, drawings, watercolours, oils, lithographs, engravings, etchings and sculpture/busts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/what-we-collect/pictures |title=National Library of Australia – Pictures |publisher=nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading rooms==
The large National Library building is home to various reading rooms and collections. On the ground floor is the Main Reading Room — this is where the bulk of the Library's Internet access terminals are located, and where wireless internet access is available. Services are also delivered on-site from the Newspaper &amp; Family History zone on the ground floor, Special Collections Reading Room on the 1st floor, and Asian Collections on level 3.

==Services==
The National Library of Australia provides a national leadership role in developing and managing collaborative online services with the Australian library community, making it easier for users to find and access information resources at the national level.

* '''Australian National Bibliographic Database'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/librariesaustralia/databases.html#nbd |title=NLA.gov.au |publisher=NLA.gov.au |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ANBD) and offers free access through the '''Libraries Australia'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://librariesaustralia.nla.gov.au/ |title=NLA.gov.au |publisher=Librariesaustralia.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; subscription based service which is also operated by the NLA. It is used for reference, collection development, cataloguing and interlibrary lending.
*'''[https://www.nla.gov.au/content/prepublication-data-service Prepublication Data Service], [[ISSN]]s and [[ISMN]]s for Australian publishers.
*'''[[PANDORA]]''', Australia's Web Archive. A collection of Australian online publications, established initially by the National Library of Australia in 1996, and now built in collaboration with nine other Australian libraries and cultural collecting organisations.
*'''Trove''', online library database aggregator

The National Library of Australia maintains a catalogue of the resources in its own collection which are available to the general public.

===Trove===
[[File:Trove (NLA website) logo.svg|thumbnail|right|The Trove logo]]
{{main|Trove}}
Trove is an online library database aggregator, a centralised national service built with the collaboration of major libraries of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/04/28/2885063.htm |title=National Library unveils web-based treasure Trove |date=28 April 2010 |newspaper=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trove's most well known feature is the digitised collection of Australian newspapers. By June 2013 over 10 million digitised pages, or 100 million articles were accessible through Trove.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/facts-and-figures Facts and figures], National Library of Australia&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the NLA's resource discovery services have been fully integrated with Trove—meaning that several (such as "music Australia", "pictures Australia" and "Australian newspapers") are now accessible only through the site. Others (such as PANDORA and the ANBD) use Trove as their primary means of public access. The service is able to locate resources about Australia and Australians, which reaches many locations otherwise unavailable to external search engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ |title=Trove.nla.gov.au |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7015">[[File:Knatterton-cover.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Cover of a German collected edition of ''Nick Knatterton'' comics.]]
'''Nick Knatterton''' is the name of a [[West Germany|West German]] [[comic strip]] and the name of its main character, a [[private detective]]. The strip was drawn by {{illm|Manfred Schmidt (artist)|de|Manfred Schmidt (Comiczeichner)}} (1913–1999) from 1950 to 1959.

It was initially released in the German magazine [[Quick (German magazine)|Quick]].&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/kue/lit/prj/com/pck/cks/de325078.htm|title=Deutschsprachige Comics|last=Schneider|first=Matthias|date=March 2005|work=Chaos und skurille Figuren – Manfred Schmidt|publisher=Goethe-Institut Stockholm|language=German|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual style of the comics is cartoony, but still realistic enough for the comic to be taken as a (at least mostly) serious detective comic. It is characterised by its unique style of humour, most of which derives from allusions to current political affairs in the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;

==Character==
The name Nick Knatterton is alluding to [[Nick Carter (literary character)|Nick Carter]] and [[Nat Pinkerton in the Fight|Nat Pinkerton]]. Hist full name is Nikolaus Kuno [[Freiherr]] [[von]] Knatter. He was born in [[Kyritz]] (also called "Kyritz an der Knatter") to Casimir Kuno von Knatter and Corinna Pimpsberg.&lt;ref name="SchmidtLappan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Manfred|title=Nick Knatterton: Alle aufregenden Abenteuer des berühmten Meisterdetektivs|year=2007|publisher=Lappan Verlag|location=Oldenburg, Germany|language=German|isbn=978-3-8303-3152-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knatterton always dresses in a [[Sherlock Holmes]]-style green plaid overcoat and cap, and smokes a pipe.

He is presented as the embodiment of a competent and effective private detective. He is not extraordinarily physically strong (although he keeps in good shape) and does not possess many fancy [[gadget]]s, but his mental capabilities, such as his power of [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], his senses, his memory and knowledge of various topics, are incredibly good, to the point of [[caricature]]. As an example, Knatterton was once able to pinpoint his location after being thrown tied and blindfolded into the back of a van, thanks to memorising the entire map of the city and feeling the van's [[momentum]] with his body when turning corners.

==Plots==

Knatterton's cases often involve wealthy [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] families with a public image to maintain. Many of the villains are recurring characters and acquainted with Knatterton and his clients, and they're usually good at heart, make up with their victims after being arrested, and everyone is happy at the end.

Female characters are often drawn as [[bombshell (sex symbol)|bombshell]]s.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;

A recurring location in the stories is the ''Alibi Bar'', a bar favoured by various shady characters. The handles on the bar's front door are shaped like [[section sign]]s ("§"). In many stories, Knatterton has found out the real situation and been able to complete his deductions when visiting the ''Alibi Bar'', where he sometimes finds a wealthy family's teenage daughter and the man who stole her jewelry wrapped up in each other's arms.

==TV series==
Nick Knatterton's adventures were translated into many languages, and a television cartoon series was produced in 1978 by the creator's own studio. All 15 episodes of the show are available on [[DVD]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=26062 Nick Knatterton (TV).] DVDCompare. 28 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; not only in Germany but also dubbed in [[Finland]] where it earned a [[Gold Record]] in three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.is.fi/viihde/art-2000000154088.html | title=Nikke Knattertonille kultalevy | publisher=Ilta-Sanomat | date=15 July 2008 | language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is narrated, with the narrator being in fact the only [[voice actor]]. Characters merely squeak when they are shown talking, and the narrator then explains what was said. Knatterton himself often voices out the conclusions of his deductions by saying "''Conclusion''" ([[German language|German]]: "(Ich) kombiniere!", literally: "I'm concluding!"), followed by the conclusion itself.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SchmidtLappan"/&gt; This has become a kind of [[catchphrase]] for him.

==Films==
The comic has been adapted into two films:

* ''{{ill|Nick Knattertons Abenteuer – Der Raub der Gloria Nylon|de|Nick Knattertons Abenteuer}}'' ([[1959 in film|1959]])
* ''{{ill|Nick Knatterton – Der Film|de}}'' ([[2002 in film|2002]])

==Radio dramas==
2007 and 2008 German based ''Der Audio Verlag'' published Nick Knatterton radio dramas in German.
* Nick Knatterton – Der indische Diamantenkoffer (March 2007)
* Nick Knatterton – Der Schuß in den künstlichen Hinterkopf (March 2007)

The '''Organization for the Protection of the People's Struggle''' ({{lang-el|'''Ο'''ργάνωση '''Π'''εριφρούρησης '''Λ'''αϊκού '''Α'''γώνα}}, abbreviated ΟΠΛΑ &amp;ndash; '''OPLA''', an acronym meaning "weapons" in Greek) was a special division of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE) during the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] in [[World War II]]. Officially, ιt was semi-autonomous part of the broader [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM). In actual fact, it was not controlled by EAM, but directly by the Politburo of the KKE. It can be described as a [[paramilitary]] security force. It operated in the cities, and its purpose was the "self-defense" of the members of the [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] and its affiliated organizations from the German occupation authorities and the collaborationist government and its organs, the Police, the [[Greek Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]] (especially its notorious branch named as Special Security, expertised at the anti-communistic struggle) and the [[Security Battalions]]. It proved to be very successful in [[assassination|assassinating]] commanders of the Security Battalions and other armed governmental forces. However, it also became involved in political assassinations of political opponents of the then-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] KKE on both ends of the political spectrum, such as [[Trotskyism|Trotskyites]] and [[Archeio-Marxism|Archeio-Marxists]]. As a result, the activities of the OPLA are a subject of heated debate even today.

The organization was also active during the [[Greek Civil War#The Dekemvriana|December 1944 events]] in [[Athens]]. Hundreds of executions of anti-communists took place in the vicinity of the [[ULEN]] refineries. Among the victims was also the well-known actress [[Eleni Papadaki]].

During the subsequent [[Greek Civil War]], OPLA acted especially in [[Thessaloniki]] and Northern Greece in 1946&amp;ndash;1947 (in these regions the name of the organization was '''Close Self-Defense''', Στενή Αυτοάμυνα in Greek). One of its more notable later actions was the assassination of Justice Minister Christos Ladas (who had signed the execution of hundreds of communists) in Athens on 1 May 1948, by OPLA and KKE member Efstratios (Stratos) Moutsogiannis. In Macedonia and Epirus during the Civil War, the OPLA assassinated many high-ranking officers of the Greek Gendarmerie.

'''Post-neoliberalism''' is a term  used to describe ideals that go against the [[Washington Consensus]] and [[neoliberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Öniş |first1=Ziya |author-link1=Ziya Onis |last2=Şenses |first2=Fikret|date=November 2003|title=Rethinking the Emerging Post-Washington Consensus: A Critical Appraisal |url=http://www.erc.metu.edu.tr/menu/series03/0309.pdf|series=ERC Working Papers in Economics |location=[[Ankara]] |publisher=[[Middle Eastern Technical University]] |volume=03 |issue=09|access-date=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is particularly strong in [[Latin America]], where the [[left-wing]] [[Pink Tide]] has had an influence on politics in the region. According to Roger Merino examples of Post-neoliberal governments include the government of [[Evo Morales]] in [[Bolivia]] and the government of [[Rafael Correa]] in [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name=ssrn.com&gt;Merino, Roger (2011). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1938677 ''What is ‘Post’ in Post-Neoliberal Economic Policy? Extractive Industry Dependence and Indigenous Land Rights in Bolivia and Ecuador'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the economic arena, the ideology{{fact|date=July 2015}} advocates for the nationalization of numerous industries, and for the redistribution of wealth.

==History==
[[File:Evo Morales at COP15.jpg|thumbnail|[[Evo Morales]], the President of [[Bolivia]], is often associated with Post-neoliberalism.]]
The idea of post-neoliberalism arose during the [[Pink Tide]], where [[left-wing]] [[Latin America]]n critics of [[neoliberalism]] like [[Hugo Chavez]] and [[Evo Morales]] were thrust into power in the 1990s and 2000s. While the ideas of post-neoliberalism aren't unique to [[Latin America]], they are largely associated with the region.&lt;ref&gt;"http://eprints.soton.ac.uk"&gt;Grugel, Jean: [http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/300440/1/Dev_and_Change_2012.pdf ''Post-neoliberalism in Latin America: Rebuilding and Reclaiming the State after Crisis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to researchers, the election of [[Hugo Chavez]] as President of [[Venezuela]] in 1999 marked a definite start of the [[Pink Tide]] and post-neoliberal movement. Since then, [[Evo Morales]], [[Néstor Kirchner]], [[Rafael Correa]], and numerous other leaders associated with the post-neoliberal movement were elected in [[Latin America]].

==Ideology==
Post neoliberalism seeks to fundamentally change the role of the state in countries where the [[Washington Consensus]] once prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;"palgrave.com"Wylde, Christopher: [http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/latin-america-after-neoliberalism-christopher-wylde/?K=9780230301597 ''Latin America After Neoliberalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, many post-neoliberal leaders advocate for the nationalization of multiple industries, most notably the oil and gas industries and mining industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://venezuelanalysis.com/tag/nationalization&lt;/ref&gt; Post-neoliberalism also advocates for the implementation of more numerous welfare benefits and more government action towards reducing poverty. Post neo-liberalism advocates for more state intervention in the economy, as seen in countries like [[Venezuela]] and [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref&gt;"http://muse.jhu.edu"&gt;Kaltwasser, Cristóbal: [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/lar/summary/v046/46.2.kaltwasser.html ''Toward Post-Neoliberalism in Latin America'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Post-neoliberalism has drawn criticism from both the left and right of the [[political spectrum]]. [[Right-wing]] critics have claimed that post-neoliberalism is vague and [[populism|populistic]]. They also claim that it harms international investment and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1938677&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ropes Mansion''' (late 1720s), also called '''Ropes Memorial''', is a Georgian [[Colonial America|Colonial]] mansion located at 318 Essex Street, located in the [[District|McIntire Historic District]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. It is now operated by the [[Peabody Essex Museum]] and open to the public.

The house was built for Samuel Barnard, a merchant. In 1768, Judge Nathaniel Ropes, Jr., purchased the house from Barnard's nephew. The Ropes family then inhabited the house until 1907, when the house was given to the Trustees of the Ropes Memorial for public benefit. 

Although altered through the years and then restored, the house looks much like its original form, with a symmetrical facade of two stories, three small pedimented gables through the roof, roof balustrade, and modillioned cornice. (Compare it to the [[Crowninshield-Bentley House]] and the [[Peirce-Nichols House]], also in Salem.) In 1807, however, its interior was extensively renovated. In the mid-1830s five rooms and the central hall were remodelled, and today's doorway installed (with details inspired by [[Asher Benjamin]]'s pattern book. In 1894 the house was moved away from the street and further modified internally. A large, fine garden was added behind the house in 1912.

It was featured in the 1993 Disney film "Hocus Pocus".

The '''Rosenbach''' is located within two 19th-century townhouses at 2008 and 2010 Delancey Place in [[Philadelphia]]. The historic houses contain the collections and treasures of Philip Rosenbach and his younger brother Dr. [[A. S. W. Rosenbach]]. The brothers owned the Rosenbach Company which became the preeminent dealer of [[rare books]], [[manuscripts]] and decorative arts during the first half of the 20th century. Dr. Rosenbach in particular was seminal in the rare book world, helping to build libraries such as the [[Widener Library]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], The [[Huntington Library]] and the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]. In 2013, the Rosenbach became a subsidiary of the [[Free Library of Philadelphia|Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation]], but maintains its own board and operates independently of the public library system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rosenbach.org/learn/news/qa-merger-rosenbach-museum-and-library-and-free-library-philadelphia-foundation |title=Q&amp;A for merger of The Rosenbach Museum and Library and Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=http://rosenbach.org |access-date=19 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118024523/https://rosenbach.org/learn/news/qa-merger-rosenbach-museum-and-library-and-free-library-philadelphia-foundation |archivedate=18 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosenbach documents a panorama of American and European culture through its vast historical, literary and artistic treasures.

==State historical marker==
On April 2, 2008, the Rosenbach received an official State Historical Marker by the [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] in recognition of the lasting contributions of museum co-founder, Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach. The commission commemorated Dr. Rosenbach’s legacy as one of America’s greatest rare book dealers and his lasting contributions to Philadelphia and beyond with a marker in front of the museum, located at 2008-2010 Delancey Place [[Delancey Place (Philadelphia)]] in the city's historic [[Rittenhouse Square]] neighborhood.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
State Historical Marker Text:
"Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach
(1876–1952)

Among America’s most influential rare book dealers, he helped build many of the nation’s great libraries. He and his brother Philip established the Rosenbach to share their personal collection with the public. They lived on this block from 1926 to 1952."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Decorative arts collections==
The greater part of the house is furnished much as the Rosenbach brothers lived in it. The furniture is mainly 18th-century English with notable examples of the work of [[Thomas Chippendale|Chippendale]], Vile, Adam, [[George Hepplewhite|Hepplewhite]] and [[Sheraton Style|Sheraton]]. Other important pieces include an olivewood box with bronze doré mounts made for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], an American recamier sofa with carving attributed to [[Samuel McIntire]] and a major Philadelphia [[highboy]]. A comprehensive collection of English silver and gold from the 17th and mid-18th centuries includes masterworks by [[Paul Storr]], [[Hester Bateman]] and a choice group of items made for the British royal family. Over one thousand portrait miniatures are included in the collection, including one by [[Nicholas Hilliard]] of [[James I of England|James I]]. Choice collections of 18th century porcelain, glass, paintings, drawings and sculpture are drawn upon to complete the furnishings.

The adjacent building, 2008 Delancey Place, was purchased by the foundation in January 1993 and allowed the museum to expand its facilities and exhibition space.

==Rare books and manuscripts from the Americana Collection==
The Americana collection begins with accounts of early voyages and tales of exploration, which includes a copy of [[Antonio Pigafetta]]'s account of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s circumnavigation of the globe and rare tracts relating to the settlement of [[Virginia]]. The books are complemented, as is every other aspect of the collection, by manuscript material. This includes letters of [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]], [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] and [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|de Soto]], including the 1532 letters of Cortés to the Council of the Indies seeking permission to form an expedition to explore the coast of [[California]]. The period of colonial settlement is well represented by early accounts and important religious tracts, particularly those relating to the various missions of the Indians, as well as a collection of [[Indian Captivity Tales]].

The first three extant books printed in the western hemisphere are present in the Rosenbach's collections—Mexico 1543-44, Lima 1584-85, and the legendary [[Bay Psalm Book]], the first book printed in what is now the United States ([[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] 1661).

The [[American Revolution]] is documented with over one hundred letters written by [[George Washington]], the original manuscript resolution of the [[Continental Congress]], a superb collection of documents by signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], Commodore Barry's ship papers, which outline the beginnings of the American navy, and a set of [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]'s ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]s'', including the only known surviving copy of the 1733 first edition, first printing.

The period of western expansion is represented by early diaries and traveler's accounts, printed pocket guides and histories. Of particular importance is the material dealing with the Pacific Northwest, including diaries of the [[Oregon]] pioneers and the document signed by [[Andrew Johnson]] authorizing [[William H. Seward|Seward]] to negotiate for the purchase of [[Alaska]].

Material from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] is extensive. It consists of more than two hundred letters of [[Abraham Lincoln]], one hundred and fifty war letters of [[Ulysses S. Grant]], two of [[Robert E. Lee]] letters and the original Resolution signed by both houses of the [[United States Congress]] proposing the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution]], which abolished slavery.

==Irish, British and American literature==
Chronologically this collection begins with a fine group of English literary manuscripts from the 15th century including [[Thomas Hoccleve]]'s poems (1410) which contain a celebrated portrait of [[Chaucer]]. There is a major manuscript of the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and a noble fragment of another illustrated version. A small and equally choice collection of books of the pre-Elizabethan and Elizabethan period is complemented by a collection of [[commonplace book]]s. There is an extremely rare first edition of ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' which was first owned by one of Bunyan's acquaintances from debtors' prison.

The majority of major British authors from the 18th century are represented by first editions of their more important works, and many of them by manuscript material as well. Some highlights are; [[Tonson]]'s assignment copy of [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', a group of [[Thomas Gray]]'s letters, five leaves of the manuscript of [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[Life of Johnson]]'' and the most extensive collection of [[Robert Burns]] manuscripts in existence.

As you enter into the 19th and 20th centuries the collection strengthens. There are manuscripts of [[Walter Scott]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] and [[John Keats|Keats]] (including a celebrated love letter to Fanny Brawne) and the only surviving fragment of Fitzgerald's ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''. The Rosenbach also has a supreme [[Dickens]] collection extending from the earliest extant manuscript to a carte-de-viste photo signed on the day before his death. The collection also includes Dickens' manuscripts of ''Nicholas Nickleby'' and the ''Pickwick Papers''. [[Lewis Carroll]] is represented by over six hundred letters, early drawings, presentation books, photographs and his own first-edition copy of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. Other manuscripts include the work of [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Conan Doyle]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Dylan Thomas]]

One of the Museum's most valuable items is the handwritten [[manuscript]] of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]].'' In honor of the work, the Museum hosts a [[Bloomsday]] celebration every year, including readings from excerpts of the book.

Also included at the Rosenbach is recreation of [[Marianne Moore]]'s living room just as she lived in it. It was in this room that she lived and worked for more than forty years. Moore's complete library, with many personally inscribed and annotated books from her friends and contemporaries including Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot and Elizabeth Bishop, is part of the Rosenbach collections as well as all of her correspondence and drafts of her poetry and unpublished memoirs.

==Maurice Sendak Collection==
Famed author and illustrator [[Maurice Sendak]] chose the Rosenbach to be the repository for his work in 1968-2014 thanks to shared literary and collecting interests.  Sendak is the author and illustrator of ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'' and 108 other books. His collection of nearly 10,000 works of art, manuscripts, books and ephemera, has been the subject of many exhibitions at the Rosenbach and has been enjoyed by visitors of all ages.  One of the most famous creators of contemporary children's books, Sendak’s work has challenged the norms of children's literature over time and continues to entrance both children and adults to this day. His innovative techniques and honest portrayal of childhood emotion are celebrated worldwide and have earned him several prestigious honors, including the Caldecott Book Medal (1964), the international Hans Christian Andersen Medal (1970), the National Medal of Arts (1996), a Library of Congress "Living Legend" medal (2000), and the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award for Literature (2003). The Rosenbach presented ''There’s a Mystery There: Sendak on Sendak'' from May 6, 2008 through May 3, 2009.  This major retrospective of over 130 pieces pulled from the museum’s vast Sendak collection&amp;nbsp;– the biggest collection of “Sendakiana” in the world&amp;nbsp;– was the largest and most ambitious exhibition of Sendak’s work ever created and featured original artwork, rare sketches, never-before-seen working materials and exclusive interview footage.  The exhibition drew on a total of over 300 objects, with new works on display every four months, providing a unique experience with each set of illustrations.

His personal works were returned to his estate in 2014 and are now in the care of the Sendak Foundation. The Rosenbach is home to his rare book collection, which includes rare books by Herman Melville, Beatrix Potter, William Blake, and pop-up books by Lothar Meggendorfer.

'''The Singerman list''' is a numeric cataloging system for [[antisemitica]] items, as defined by the 1982 [[bibliography|bibliographic]] listing, ''Antisemitic Propaganda: an annotated bibliography and research guide'' by [[Robert Singerman]]. The list consists of a [[chronological]] listing, by year at least, of books, [[pamphlet]]s, and other sorts of texts, with full bibliographic information. In addition each item is assigned a unique 4-digit number with a short, paragraph-length, annotation. For example, "Singerman 0121" identifies uniquely a particular [[impression (publishing)|imprint]] of ''[[The Jewish Bolshevism]]''.

Most imprints of the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', not just [[first edition]]s, that were published in Europe or the [[United States]] are listed and uniquely identified, as are many other noteworthy antisemitic publications.

The book's [[foreword]] is by [[Colin Holmes (British historian)|Colin Holmes]]. As of 2007, the work is [[out of print]].

The book is used extensively by [[rare book]] dealers and [[antiquarians]] specializing in antisemitica in precisely identifying [[first edition]]s and [[rare book]]s or [[impression (publishing)|imprint]]s sought after by [[book collector]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

The '''spiny dogfish''', '''spurdog''',{{cn|date=December 2018}} '''mud shark''', or '''piked dogfish''' (''Squalus acanthias'') is one of the best known [[species]] of the [[Squalidae]] (dogfish) [[family (biology)|family]] of [[shark]]s, which is part of the [[Squaliformes]] order. While these common names may apply to several species, ''Squalus acanthias'' is distinguished by having two spines (one [[wikt:anterior|anterior]] to each [[dorsal fin]]) and lacks an [[anal fin]]. It is found mostly in shallow waters and further offshore in most parts of the world, especially in temperate waters. Spiny dogfish in the northern Pacific Ocean have recently been reevaluated and found to constitute a separate species, now known as "[[Pacific spiny dogfish]]", ''[[Squalus suckleyi]]''.&lt;ref name=Ebert2010&gt;{{cite journal

==Description and behavior==
The spiny dogfish has dorsal fins, no anal fin, and dark green spots along its back. The [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] fin has asymmetrical lobes, forming a [[heterocercal]] tail.
The species name ''acanthias'' refers to the shark's two spines. These are used defensively. If captured, the shark can arch its back to pierce its captor. Glands at the base of the spines secrete a mild venom.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Males mature at around 11 years of age, growing to {{convert|80|-|100|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in length; females mature in 18–21 years and are slightly larger than males, reaching {{convert|98.5|-|159|cm|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Animal"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kindersley |first= Dorling |year=2001 |title=Animal |location=New York City |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0-7894-7764-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sexes are greyish brown in color and are [[countershading|countershaded]]. Males are identified by a pair of pelvic fins modified as sperm-transfer organs, or "claspers". The male inserts one clasper into the female cloaca during copulation.

Reproduction is [[aplacental viviparous]], which was before called [[ovoviviparity]]. Fertilization is internal. The male inserts one clasper into the female oviduct orifice and injects sperm along a groove on the clasper's dorsal section. Immediately following fertilization, the eggs are surrounded by thin shells called "candles" with one candle usually surrounding several eggs. Mating takes place in the winter months with gestation lasting 22–24 months. Litters range between 2 and 11 but average 6 or 7.

Spiny dogfish are bottom-dwellers. They are commonly found at depths of around {{convert|50-149|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but have been found deeper than {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jose I.

Life span is estimated to be up to 100 years and their gestation period is 18 to 24 months, which may be the longest of any known animal.&lt;ref name="lifespan-sharksmou"&gt;[http://sharksmou.org/spiny-dogfish Spiny dogfish].

==Commercial use==
Spiny dogfish are consumed as human food in [[Europe]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Chile]]. The meat is primarily consumed in [[England]], [[France]], the [[Benelux]] countries and [[Germany]]. The fins and tails are processed into fin needles and are used in less expensive versions of shark fin soup in Chinese cuisine. In England this and other dogfish are sold in fish and chip shops as "huss", and it was historically sold as "rock salmon" until this term was outlawed by consumer legislation. In France it is sold as "small salmon" (''saumonette'') and in Belgium and Germany it is sold as "sea eel" (''zeepaling'' and ''Seeaal'', respectively). It is also used as fertilizer, liver oil, and pet food, and, because of its availability, cartilaginous skull, and manageable size, as a popular [[vertebrate]] dissection specimen, in both high schools and universities. Reported catches in 2000–2009 varied between 13,800 (2008) and 31,700 (2000) tonnes.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;{{Cite book

[[Bottom trawling|Bottom trawlers]] and sink [[gillnet]]s are the primary equipment used to harvest spiny dogfish. In Mid-Atlantic and Southern New England fisheries, they are often caught when harvesting larger [[groundfish]], classified as [[bycatch]], and discarded. Recreational fishing accounts for an insignificant portion of the spiny dogfish harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen’s Alliance has sponsored an initiative which promotes local, sustainably caught use of the dogfish in restaurants and fish markets in the [[Cape Cod]] area of [[Massachusetts]]. The effort is funded by the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] and attempts to get the public to consume under utilized fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilcox |first=Meg |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2017/07/03/dogfish-what-for-dinner-cape/rtlwFwlNn8RsJ7jqoOx7CN/story.html |title=Dogfish — it’s what’s for dinner on the Cape |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2017-07-04 |accessdate=2017-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation status and management==
Once the most abundant shark species in the world, populations of ''Squalus acanthias'' have declined significantly. They are classified in the [[IUCN Red List]] of threatened species as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] globally and [[Critically endangered]] in the Northeast Atlantic, meaning stocks around Europe have decreased by at least 95%. This is a direct result of overfishing to supply northern Europe's taste for rock salmon, saumonette or zeepaling. Despite these alarming figures, very few management or conservation measures are in place for ''Squalus acanthias''.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; In EU waters, a [[Total Allowable Catch]] (TAC) has been in place since 1999, but until 2007 it only applied to ICES Areas IIa and IV. It was also set well above the actual weight of fish being caught until 2005, rendering it meaningless. Since 2009 a maximum landing size of {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} has been imposed in order to protect the most valuable mature females. The TAC for 2011 was set at 0 tons, ending targeted fishing for the species in EU waters. It remains to be seen if populations will be able to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ices.dk/committe/acom/comwork/report/2011/2011/Spurdog%20NEA.pdf |title=Spurdog in the Northeast Atlantic |author= |date=2011 |work=Advice September 2011 |publisher=[[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]], Copenhagen |accessdate=7 September 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent past the European market for spiny dogfish has increased dramatically, which led to the overfishing and decline of the species. This drastic increase led to the creation and implementation of many fishery management policies placing restrictions on the fishing of spiny dogfish. However, since the species is a late maturing fish, it takes a while to rebuild the population.

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the spiny dogfish to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205030730/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species]] (CMS; also known as the [[Bonn Convention]]) listed the species (Northern Hemisphere populations) under Annex I of its [[Migratory Sharks MoU|Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120622052318/http://www.cms.int/species/sharks/MoU/Migratory_Shark_MoU_Eng.pdf PDF]. Cms.int. Retrieved on 2016-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years however, the US has implemented fishing controls and opened up the fishery. The proposed quota for 2011 was {{convert|35.5|lb|kg|disp=preunit|million }} with a trip limit of {{convert|4000|lb|kg}}, an increase over past years in which the quota has ranged from {{convert|5|lb|kg|disp=preunit|million }} to {{convert|20|lb|kg|disp=preunit|million }} with trip limits from {{convert|2000|to|3000|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mid-Atlantic Council Adopts Increase in Spiny Dogfish Quotas |date=19 October 2011 |work=Atlantic Highlands Herald |url=http://www.ahherald.com/newsbrief-mainmenu-2/monmouth-county-news/11896-mid-atlantic-council-adopts-increase-in-spiny-dogfish-quotas |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102145128/http://www.ahherald.com/newsbrief-mainmenu-2/monmouth-county-news/11896-mid-atlantic-council-adopts-increase-in-spiny-dogfish-quotas |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, NOAA announced the Eastern US Atlantic spiny dogfish stocks to be rebuilt&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/nero/hotnews/press_release/2010/news/NR1018/ NOAA Announces Recovery of Spiny Dogfish Stock]. greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 concerns about dogfish posing a serious predatory threat to other stocks resulted in an emergency amendment of the quota with nearly {{convert|15|lb|kg|disp=preunit|million }} being added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Threat of Dogfish Sharks Unite Commercial and Recreational Fishermen From Maine to North Carolina|date=May 4, 2009|publisher= FishNet USA via Prnewswire|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/threat-of-dogfish-sharks-unite-commercial-and-recreational-fishermen-from-maine-to-north-carolina-61723757.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossil range==

As a cartilaginous fish, shark tissues usually do not fossilize.

Squalus acanthias fossils date back to the Miocene 11 MYA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=taxonInfo&amp;taxon_no=151823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''sports memorabilia''' usually refers to a souvenir, memento, keepsake or token of remembrance that is directly connected to a famous athlete, sporting event or personality. These items are generally collected by fans that find sentimental and/ or monetary value of the item(s). There is no set parameter regarding the number of items, type of sport, or even the era that an item may reflect. A piece of certain kind may be considered a [[collectable]] item.

==Monetary value==
Items that have been in direct contact with a famous athlete can have significant monetary value. Game used items such as the ball which [[Mark McGwire]] hit for his 70th home run of the 1998 season sold for $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://tech.mit.edu/V119/N3/homerun.3w.html&lt;/ref&gt; The most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold, a [[New York Yankees]] baseball jersey worn by [[Babe Ruth]] during the 1920 season, sold for $4,415,658 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upcomingautographsignings.com/2012/05/most-expensive-piece-of-sports.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the ten most valuable [[sports cards]] and memorabilia sold for a record-setting combined $12,186,294.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seideman|first1=David|title=In 2016 The Top 10 Most Valuable Sports Cards And Memorabilia Commanded A Record $12 Million+|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidseideman/2016/12/29/in-2016-top-10-most-valuable-sports-cards-and-memorabilia-command-record-12-million/#2b2f7b8b132b|accessdate=24 April 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|date=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autographed pieces of memorabilia are usually more valuable that non-autographed items. Items that have been personalized (i.e. "To Mark," Best Wishes Travis," or "Happy Birthday John") can add sentimental value. Collectors who are interested in purchasing sports memorabilia often look for a [[certificate of authenticity]]. Several companies have developed systems to prove authenticity of game-used or autographed memorabilia, and collectors will generally seek out dealers that offer a lifetime, money-back, authenticity guarantee.

The value of a signed item will generally be relative to the profile of the signer and the scarcity of similar items. When a high-profile sports star dies, the value often rises as there will no longer be an opportunity to get more. For example, the death of [[Muhammad Ali]] in 2016 raised both demand and prices for signed Muhammad Ali memorabilia.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
It could be said that collecting sports memorabilia goes back to the first decades of the 20th century, when many people would collect baseballs from [[baseball]] games and many asked [[Babe Ruth]] for [[autograph]]s. As years passed and many other sports stars joined their sports, memorabilia collectors also began to broaden their horizons.

When the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], [[MLB]], [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and [[National Football League|NFL]] began selling their jerseys in stores during the 1980s, game used jerseys also became a hot item among sports memorabilia collectors. Former NBA player [[Dennis Rodman]] was famous for taking off his jerseys and throwing them to the stands after his games were over. [[Michael Jordan]] is probably the [[basketball]] player whose memorabilia is most sought after by collectors.

The highest price fetched for a [[football (soccer)]] match worn shirt is $224,000.  The shirt belonged to the legendary [[Pelé]], who wore it during the 1970 World Cup final in which Brazil went on to win. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3020876/Peles-shirt-goes-for-record.html|title=The Telegraph|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular items==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Collectors like to look back in time when they are finding sports memorabilia. Items such as [[John L. Sullivan]] and [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] fight posters have sold well before. There is also a [[boxing]] glove signed by Sullivan, Johnson, Ruth and many [[Hollywood]] stars and American Presidents that has sold for a lot of money before. This glove is now on display at the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]].

Other popular items in sports memorabilia are "game-used" items.  Game used can refer to an item worn on the field during a game, worn during the pregame, or by a player on the bench.  These can include jerseys, pants, caps, helmets, gloves, shoes, or even sunglasses.  Game Used can also refer to bats, balls, turf, flags, or other items used by a player on in the stadium.  In NASCAR, and other forms of automobile racing, the metal from the cars, the tires, the driver uniforms, and the crew uniforms are popular collectables. Concrete from the various racetracks are also popular. Trunks (shorts or pants), used by popular boxers such as [[Greg Haugen]] in boxing fights are also popular and sometimes sell for 100 dollars or more.

In Europe, football (soccer) memorabilia is the largest market, with high-profile players shirts, boots and photos in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exclusivememorabilia.com/|title=Exclusive Memorabilia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Event programme]]s from [[rugby union]] and [[football (soccer)]] matches are also highly collectable.

'''''The Cane as a Weapon''''' is a book by Andrew Chase Cunningham presenting a concise system of [[self defense]] making use of a [[walking stick]] or [[umbrella]]. It was first published in 1912 in the United States.

Cunningham was a civil engineer attached to the [[United States Navy]] throughout the latter years of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century. A participant in the sport of [[fencing]], he was the president of the [[Washington, D.C.]] Fencing Organization and in 1906 he wrote a Naval drill manual entitled ''[[Sabre]] and [[Bayonet]]''. In April 1912, Cunningham directed a large fencing tournament, featuring competitors from throughout [[New York City]], [[Boston]] and Washington, D.C. The first prize was a magnificent trophy called "The Fighting Gaul" which had been donated by the French Ambassador, Jules Jusserand.

''The Cane as a Weapon'', Cunningham’s second book, consisted of eighteen pages of text and twelve photographs. It is thought to be the only self-defense manual of its type to be produced in the United States during this period.

Although several European authors had previously produced books and articles on the subject of self-defense with a walking cane, the Cunningham cane defense system was unique in several respects.

Of the three basic guard positions that he advocates, two involve holding the cane with the tip pointed towards the ground. These positions have the advantage of appearing to be non-threatening and also make it difficult for an opponent to seize the defender’s [[weapon]], unlike the more orthodox, fencing-based guards advocated by some other writers. They also serve as positions of invitation, exposing the defender’s head and torso to attack while providing the opportunity to counter such attacks with powerful, upward-sweeping parries.

The third basic guard position, which Cunningham refers to as the double-handed guard, was also featured in several previous works on cane defense. However, his system places an unusual emphasis upon this type of guard, stressing the augmented strength of attacks and defenses and the possibility of quick, snapping attacks and parries to be executed with either hand. Cunningham's advocacy of this position might have been due to his previous experience at bayonet fencing. The double-handed guard also facilitates powerful close-range jabs and "bar strikes" with the portion of the cane held between the defender’s hands.

The author pays special attention to the various different types of counter-attacks, defining the action of performing a [[Cut (wound)|cut]] or [[Strike (attack)|strike]] according to the direction, height, target and "character" of the action.  The latter are defined as snap, half-arm, full-arm or swinging cuts.  He also distinguishes between two types of "stabbing" blow with the cane, the [[jab]] and the [[thrust]].

The Cunningham system is [[ambidextrous]] and the cane is frequently passed from hand to hand during the defensive sequences that are described and illustrated in the book. Defenses are generally in the form of counter-attacks to the assailant's weapon or to the weapon-wielding hand and targets for counter-attack include the head, throat, midsection, hands, elbows, knees and shins.  Instructions are offered for self-defense against multiple opponents, [[grappling]] and [[boxing]] attacks as well as against attackers armed with [[knives]] and sticks.

The book also includes a series of thirty-seven written descriptions of defensive exercises.

In 2006, an expanded edition was published through lulu.com.

'''''The Opal''''' (1851–1860) is a ten volume journal written and edited by the patients of the [[Utica Psychiatric Center|Utica State Lunatic Asylum]], circa 1851.  On its more than 3,000 pages, writers talked of their experiences and world views, giving great insight to the environment of New York's premiere state-operated [[Psychiatric hospital|Asylum]], in [[Utica, New York]].  Themes that continuously arose in the poetry, prose, political commentary, and articles about insanity include issues concerning medication, restraint, seclusion, human rights, liberty, overcoming oppression, and support.

'''Women for Israel's Tomorrow''' ({{lang-he-n|נשים למען עתיד ישראל}}) more commonly known as '''Women in Green''', {{Hebrew|נשים בירוק}}) is an Israel non profit organization established in 1993 by Ruth and Michael Matar in response to the Oslo Accords. The organization is currently headed by Nadia Matar and Yehudit Katsover.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womeningreen.org|title=Women In Green|website=www.womeningreen.org|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The organization is a grassroots movement of women and men, youth and adults, religious and non-religious - "unified in their love for, dedication and faithfulness to the [[Land of Israel]]". The group, which is a registered non-profit organization founded in 1993, is not affiliated with any political party, and has gained wide public support in Israel and abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The more familiar name of the movement, '''Women in Green''', is based on the green hats that the activists wore during the years of struggle and vigils against the [[Oslo I Accord|Oslo Accords.]] "The green hats symbolize the opposition to returning to the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] and transferring territories of the Land of Israel to foreign hands. 'The Land of Israel for the People of Israel' is the motto that has accompanied our movement ever since its founding."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the group's website, the movement is "dedicated to safeguarding our G-d-given Biblical homeland. We act out of the belief in the central role of the Land of Israel to the future of the Jewish People. 'Eretz Yisrael L'Am Yisrael' – 'the Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel' is our motto."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women in Green opposes a [[two-state solution]], strongly opposes the return of land captured in the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, and strongly supports [[Israeli settlement]] of those territories, which it proposes should be [[annexation|annexed]]. Women in Green also opposed Israeli military withdrawal from southern [[Lebanon]] in 2000.

== Activities ==

=== The Oz veGaon Nature Preserve ===
[[File:Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar, Naftali Frenkel.jpg|alt=Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar, Naftali Frenkel, z"l in whose memory The Oz veGaon Nature Preserve was created in response to their murder.

The boys were abducted only dozens of meters away from the site upon which the nature reserve was built.]]
In June 2014, on the same night it became known that the three abducted teens, Gilad Shaer, Eyal Yifrach and Naftali Frenkel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Pages/Bring-back-our-boys-Eyal-Naftali-Gilad.aspx|title=Eyal, Naftali and Gilad z"l|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been [[2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers|murdered]] – members of '''Women in Green''', together with residents of the area of Judea and with the support of the [[Gush Etzion Regional Council|Gush Etzion Council]], ascended to Abu Suda Forest, above the [[Gush Etzion Junction]], only dozens of meters from the site of the abduction. There they established a nature preserve in memory of the youths –'''The Oz veGaon (Gilad Eyal and Naftali) Nature Preserve'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Women in Green|title=Going up to Oz veGaon|date=2014-07-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mKfU0tV9w|accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location has become an active tourism-educational site where visitors come from the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etziontour.org.il/attraction/givat-oz-vegaon/|title=Shmurat Oz Vegaon {{!}} gush etzion tourism|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every Friday the Women in Green movement holds lectures, workshops and cultural events at the site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the first two years of the nature preserve's establishment approximately 30,000 youths came to help prepare the site. They participated in removing rocks, thistles and weeds, and were instructed in self-defense.  The parents of the abducted youths come often to the preserve,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Women in Green|title=The First Year of the Oz veGaon Nature Preserve- Racheli Frenkel, mother of Naftali Frenkel, z"l|date=2015-07-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD2qEHKZ4Aw|accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as politicians and public figures&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Women in Green|title=Avital Sharansky at Oz veGaon Nature Preserve|date=2015-02-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9dCZJll6A|accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Women in Green|title=Rabbi Riskin speaking on the holiness of the settlements|date=2015-06-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZCUwySYT9c|accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; who support the site's development as a place of education, cultural events, family recreation and camping.

=== The Sovereignty Campaign: Israeli Sovereignty over Judea and Samaria ===
In recent years the movement has branched out to include '''The Sovereignty Campaign''', a broad public relations campaign calling for the application of Israeli sovereignty over [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ribonut.co.il|title=Sovereignty Journal|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ribonut.co.il|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was born in 2011 in response to what came to feel like a Sisyphean effort, continuously climbing and descending hill after hill, with no foreseeable end in sight.  This caused the movement's leaders to see the necessity of branching out from the arena of settlement activity to the arena of diplomacy in order to protect Judea and Samaria. They no longer believed it was enough to merely say "'No' to a Palestinian state". The nationalist movement had to initiate its own plan of action. This sentiment gave rise to the Sovereignty Campaign: Israeli Sovereignty over Judea and Samaria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Sovereignty Journal ===
This currently ongoing Sovereignty Campaign features billboards, conferences, lectures, parlor meetings, publication of manifestos and the production of the Sovereignty Journal, of which hundreds of thousands of copies are distributed in Hebrew and in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womeningreen.org/new-sovereignty-journal/ The Sovereignty Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sovereignty Journal includes articles, reports and interviews with political and public figures who call for implementing the vision of sovereignty as Israel's political vision.

=== Annual Tisha B'Av walk around the Walls of the Old City ===
One of Women in Green's yearly activities is the Annual Walk around the Walls of the Old City on the eve of [[Tisha B'Av]]. According to the findings of the Cairo Geniza, the custom of walking around the gates has its roots a thousand years ago. A Jew of the 19th century described the status: "Our custom in the holy city of Jerusalem will be built and prepared to round the wall from the outside for all the intermediate days of Yom Tov, women and children, to fulfill the verse in Tehillim: Chapter 48 "Walk about Zion, and go round about her; count the towers thereof.  Mark ye well her ramparts, traverse her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.", and it is the custom of Israel to be holy from previous years."&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:סיבוב השערים]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} The custom was renewed in 1994 and has been ongoing for 23 years. Thousands of people participate in the Walk, which includes speeches by Rabbis, politicians and public figures at the [[Lions' Gate]] and culminates at the [[Western Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnmv-6gYZ_w Annual walk]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From 1993 until 2005 the movement was led by Ruth Matar and her daughter-in-law Nadia Matar. During these years the movement focused its activities on vigils against the Oslo Accords, using public relations and educational activities to protest what the movement defined as relinquishing Israel's sovereign land. Public relation activities followed multiple approaches, including a weekly radio program that was broadcast by [[Arutz Sheva|Arutz 7]], in both Hebrew and English.

In 2003, Ruth and Nadia Matar, argued that "[W]hat is needed is a determination to bring peace to this important area of the world, and there is nothing more logical and simple than to allow for a vibrant democratic Jewish State living peacefully with its neighbors." Those Arabs who wish to remain and live peacefully within a Jewish country would become citizens. They suggested offering monetary compensation to those Arabs who wanted to leave, many of whom came to Israel within the last 100 years. In this article, ''Transfer of Arabs is the Only Solution for Peace,'' they wrote: "Fair payment can be made to those Arabs who agree to leave the Holy Land...Arabs who wish to remain can do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freeman.org/m_online/oct03/matar.htm|title=Transfer of Arabs is the Only Solution for Peace! (Ruth and Nadia Matar) October, 2003|website=www.freeman.org|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They maintained that the [[United States]] and the [[E.U.]] could use the aid they provide (and political pressure) to help resettle Arabs, and that co-operation from surrounding [[Arab states]] would be required as well.

Women in Green's political activism extends to the United States, where it maintains several chapters, which hold vigils and fundraisers every year. An advertisement on its website for a protest scheduled for April 11, 2005, when Israeli prime minister [[Ariel Sharon]] visited president [[George W. Bush]]'s ranch in [[Crawford, Texas]], said:

:''The Arab-Moslem threat is real and palpable. They hate America and Israel and a democratic way of life, and have a completely different concept of what is moral. If you don't take a stand against the Arabs and the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudis]] NOW, you will live to regret it.... Before you know it the Arab hordes will be at your doorstep. They believe in no compromise. The Arabs are ruthless, and are waiting and praying for the opportunity to strike. Don't wait until they have Nuclear Arms. Act now, before it is too late!''&lt;ref name=Official&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womeningreen.org/ |title=Women in Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passionately opposed to the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Jewish expulsion from Gush Katif]], in 2004 [[Nadia Matar]] compared the government's intention to [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|remove]] Jews from [[Gaza City|Gaza]] to the involvement of the ''[[Judenrat]]'' ("Jewish Council") in [[Berlin]] in 1942, which, under orders from the [[Nazi Germany|German]] government expelled the Jewish community from that city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yad Vashem slams Women in Green for Judenrat comparison |author=Nadav Shragai |newspaper=Haaretz |date=September 21, 2004 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/yad-vashem-slams-women-in-green-for-judenrat-comparison-1.135213 |accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- who were then sent to die in [[The Holocaust]]: it would be better to say exactly where they were sent, or say nothing.--&gt; When Yonatan Bassi, the head of the department overseeing the civilian aspects of the withdrawal, sent a letter to the Jews of Gaza explaining the procedures for their evacuation she wrote to him and attached a copy of a 1942 letter sent by the ''Judenrat'' explaining the procedures for their evacuation. Matar stated:

:''Yonatan Bassi is a much worse version of the 'Judenrat' in the Holocaust, for then in the Holocaust, this was forced upon those Jewish leaders by the Nazis, and it is very difficult for us to judge them today. But today no one stands with a pistol to Bassi's head and forces him to cooperate with the deportation of the Jews of [[Gush Katif]] and northern Samaria.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/4186.htm|title=J'accuse:The background of the Accusations Against Me|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=August 10, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605163739/http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/4186.htm|archivedate=June 5, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2005, members of the Matar and Finkelstein families, co-founder of Women for Israel's tomorrow, moved in a shared caravan to [[Kfar Yam]], in the Gush Katif settlement in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nadia Matar |date=July 27, 2005 |title=Op-Ed: Just Before Communications Are Cut |publisher=Arutz Sheva |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/5371 |accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that summer, the founders, Ruth and Michael Matar, ceased their activity for health reasons.

In 2005, Yehudit Katsover from [[Kiryat Arba]]-[[Hebron]], a veteran activist for the Land of Israel, principal of the Teachers’ College in Kiryat Arba-Hevron, a branch of Efrata College, joined the group. Since then she has been leading Women in Green together with Nadia Matar.

The group added an element of practical activism, believing that this addition was necessary to strengthen the hold on all of the territories of the Land of Israel. Katsover and Matar focused the activities on parts of [[Area C (West Bank)]], where, according to their claim, the Palestinian Authority is attempting, with foreign funding, to seize lands belonging to the State of Israel.

The movement and its activists fought for the opening of the [[Walaja]] bypass road to allow access from the west to [[Gush Etzion]], they restored the Jewish presence to the Shdema military camp&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visions-israel.com/shdema|title=Shdema|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Har Homa]] and [[Tekoa, Gush Etzion|Tekoa]] and to [[Dura, Hebron|Adurayim]], which is south of [[Mount Hebron]]; they planted trees on state land in [[Netzarim|Netzer]], which is between [[Alon Shvut]] and [[Elazar, Gush Etzion|Elazar]] in order to prevent Arab take-over of these lands, and they organized activities to strengthen the Jewish presence on the Eitam Hill (Givat Eitam, in Hebrew), which is located in [[Efrat]].

The group integrates its vigils and activities with cultural and educational activities such as concerts, exhibitions, lectures, lessons and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/NashimBeYarok/videos?view=0|title=NashimBeYarok|website=YouTube|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

==Critical reception==
''You Deserve a Drink'' was generally well-received by reviewers. Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', actor and comedian [[Michael Ian Black]] stated that "Hart is a pull-no-punches comedian with a talent for self-deprecation in the guise of self-aggrandizement, a winning formula."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Black|first1=Michael|title=Humor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/humor.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colleen Stinchcombe, writer for [[SheKnows Media|She Knows]] said that "She is undeniably a funny lady, and her humor translates beautifully — even more powerfully, I'd argue — to the page. Her jokes have more time to build, her punchlines land harder. She's created an entirely hilarious read that will delight her current fans by giving them a pitcher-sized serving of her normally shot-sized jokes and entice new readers who have enjoyed recent books by other humor heavy-hitters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stinchcombe|first1=Colleen|title=Mamrie Hart's new memoir is a hilarious lesson in radical self-acceptance|url=http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1084050/you-deserve-a-drink-is-a-book-about-radical-self-acceptance|publisher=She Knows|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
