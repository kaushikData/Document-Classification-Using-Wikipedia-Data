He was a psychologist who focused on SOCE, and wrote on the topic. Although raised by a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] mother and a [[Baptist]] father, Byrd converted to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and was very active in the debate within the LDS Church on issues involving [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=NoMoreGoodbyesReview /&gt;

==Professional life==
Byrd  was a well known supporter of [[conversion therapy]], and authored more than 100 publications, including books, peer-reviewed scientific journals, law journals, book chapters, invited commentaries and opinion editorials, many of which addressed issues of human sexuality.  In 2002, he presented a paper which describes a technique called ''gender-affirmative therapy''. He stated: "The basic premise of gender-affirmative therapy is that social and emotional variables affect gender identity which, in turn, determines sexual orientation. The work of the therapist is to help people understand their gender development. Subsequently, such individuals are able to make choices that are consistent with their value system. The focus of therapy is to help clients fully develop their masculine or feminine identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

One of the largest was a survey of 882 people who were undergoing therapy, attending ex-gay groups or ex-gay conferences: 22.9% reported they had not undergone any changes, 42.7% reported some changes, and 34.3% reported much change in sexual orientation. As a group, they reported large reductions in homosexual thoughts and fantasies and improvements in their psychological, interpersonal, and spiritual well-being.&lt;ref name="Nicolosi2000"&gt;{{cite journal

Byrd received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[psychology]] from [[Brigham Young University]], a post-doctoral degree in Child and Family Psychology from [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] and [[Medical College of Virginia]], and a post-doctoral degree in [[Behavioral Medicine]] from [[Loyola University, Chicago]]. He also received both an [[Master of Public Health|M.P.H.]] from the [[University of Utah]], School of Medicine, and an [[M.B.A.]] also from the [[University of Utah]].

Byrd served as the Director of Clinical Training for [[LDS Social Services]], was a Clinical Professor at [[Brigham Young University]], and was, at the time of his death, a Clinical Professor at the [[University of Utah]], School of Medicine, with appointments in the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine and in Department of Psychiatry, with an adjunct clinical appointment in the Department of Family Studies, also at the University of Utah.

He also had training in genetics, biochemistry and neurochemistry from the [[University of California at Berkeley]].

==Within the LDS Church==
{{further|Homosexuality and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The LDS Church does not view homosexual attractions as sinful, but does teach its members to abstain from homosexual sex. It does not have an official view on the cause of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/manual/god-loveth-his-children/god-loveth-his-children|title=God Loveth His Children |accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Byrd had been prominent in defending and explaining the church's position, as well as promoting his own views. He wrote four books aimed at LDS audiences and, in 1999, published ''When a Loved One Struggles with Same-Sex Attraction'' in the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', an official magazine of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Origins==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics was founded in 1917 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], by a group of women led by [[Lenna F. Cooper]] and the Academy's first president, [[Lulu G. Graves]], who were dedicated to helping the government conserve food and improve [[public health]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=historyofadabook&gt;Barber, Mary I.

Lippincott: 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=pittsburghpostgazette&gt;Mayer, Jean and Dr. Johanna Dwyer.

February 27, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original mission of the Academy was in part to help make maximal use of America's food resources during wartime.&lt;ref name=cnnfoodindustry&gt;Foer, Jonathan Safran.

Between the 1930s and 1960s, membership skyrocketed to more than 60,000.&lt;ref name=adamilestone/&gt; Growth trajectory has since stabilized, and the Academy marked its 70,000th member when a female dietitian in Texas rejoined the Academy in May 2009.&lt;ref name=adamilestone/&gt; Since its founding in 1917, the Academy has gained members in every decade.&lt;ref name=adamilestone/&gt;

[[File:Academy-of-Nutrition-and-Dietetics-Seal.jpg|thumb|right|Current Seal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]]
An authorized seal for the organization was adopted by the Executive Board and presented to members on October 24, 1940.&lt;ref name=seal&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Timeline|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/history-timeline|website=eatrightPRO.org|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its center are symbols of the three main characteristics of the profession: a balance scale, representing science as the foundation and symbolizing equality; a caduceus, representing the close relationship between dietetics and medicine; and a cooking vessel, representing cookery and food preparation. Around the main design is a shaft of wheat, representing bread, the staff of life, and stylized acanthus leaves, representing growth and life. Over the design is a cornucopia, representing an abundant food supply. Beneath the design is the motto, Quam Plurimis Prodesse ("To benefit as many as possible"). Around the edge is the name of the organization and the date of its founding written in Roman numerals.

The seal is still in use on Registration Status Certificates for both registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, as well as on the gold Member Pin.

According to current Academy president Sylvia Escott Stump, the group changed their name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in 2012 to reflect the scientific and academic expertise of its members.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Jeannine.

=== National Nutrition Month ===
In 1973, the Academy created “National Nutrition Week.” The theme the first year was "Invest in Yourself...Buy Nutrition.”&lt;ref name=bryantimes&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iVgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WlIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5360,4029238&amp;dq=american+dietetic+association&amp;hl=en Diatetic Association tells of Nat'l Nutrition Week].

==Finances and Organization==
In 2015, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics had disclosed net assets of $48 million, the bulk of which was in cash and investments.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt; It took in $11.3M in annual membership dues, and an additional $7.4M in registration and examination fees. In 2015, it took in $35.2 million in revenue on expenses of $38.4M for an operating loss of $3.4M. After accounting for return on investments, the Academy posted a deficit of $544,722 for the 2015 fiscal year.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt; In the same year, they received $1.1 million in corporate sponsorships from companies like General Mills, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo via donations, joint initiatives, and programs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/about%20us/annual%20reports/annualreport2015.ashx#page=5 |title=2015 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Annual Reports |publisher=EatrightPRO.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-02}} p. 5: “CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP: To advance the Academy's mission of empowering members to be the food and nutrition leaders, the Academy's corporate sponsorship program allows for purposeful collaboration with food and nutrition organizations. ”&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has offices both in Chicago and Washington DC. In addition to the Academy, the organization maintains several other organizations and entities, including the Commission on Dietetic Registration, Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education, Dietetic Practice Groups, Academy Political Action Committee, and Academy Foundation. There are also several “member interest groups” which include more than 4,800 members with common interests or specialties including Fifty Plus in Nutrition and Dietetics; Filipino Americans in Dietetics and Nutrition; Muslims in Dietetics and Nutrition; and National Organization of Blacks in Dietetics and Nutrition.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt;

===Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation===
In 1966, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics established the Foundation as a [[501(c) organization|501(C)(3)]] public charity. According to its mission statement, the Foundation is the “only charitable organization devoted exclusively to promoting good nutrition.” Its mission is to advance public health and nutrition with focus on three initiatives: scholarships, Healthy Weight for Kids and food and nutrition research.&lt;ref name=charitynav&gt;[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=8467 American Dietetic Association Foundation]. ''Charity Navigator''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Foundation had charitable contributions and revenues of $4.23 million, of which $1.7 million went to program expenses, $540,000 went to administrative expenses, and $289,000 went to fund raising expenses. Its executive director, Mary Beth Whalen, is paid $215,000 per year. These figures earned the Foundation a 60.95/70 score by [[Charity Navigator|CharityNavigator.com]] (four stars for transparency, three stars for its financials).&lt;ref name=charitynav/&gt;

In 2011, the Foundation received corporate contributions totaling around $1.2 million from organizations such as [[Nestle]], [[Kelloggs]], [[Mars, Inc]] [[Coca-Cola]] and the [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]],&lt;ref name="eatright"/&gt; as well as a $500,000 donation industrial food giant [[General Mills]] to promote healthy eating for kids.&lt;ref name=thestreet&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10789235/1/general-mills-partners-with-american-dietetic-association-to-help-kids-adopt-healthy-eating-and-exercise-habits.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEFI General Mills Partners With American Dietetic Association To Help Kids Adopt Healthy Eating And Exercise Habits].

==Influence and positions==
Through its research journal, the Academy shapes and influences the public and legislative discussion about health, food safety and nutrition. Academy RD's are regularly quoted in world publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Wall Street Journal]], [[USA Today]], [[Los Angeles Times]] [[Men's Fitness]], [[O, The Oprah Magazine|O Magazine]], [[Consumer Reports]], [[Forbes]] and [[Huffington Post]]. In 2010, the organization received approximately 30 billion media impressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatright.org/Media/content.aspx?id=5202 |title=ADA Annual Reports |publisher=Eatright.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}} p. 2: “Coverage of ADA totaled more than 30 billion media impressions, including stories in ''The New York Times'', Wlal Street Journal, USA Today, Los Angeles Times and Chicago Sun-Times.

===Research and Publications===
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics publishes position papers on public health regarding [[pediatric]] ([[children]]'s) health, [[food technology]], [[food safety]], [[geriatrics]] ([[elderly]]) health, [[Health care politics|health-care reform]], [[obesity]] and food and nutrition topics through the ''[[Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]]'' (''ANDJ'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Journal|url=http://www.andjrnl.org/aims|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has also published 3 editions of the ''American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duyff |first=Roberta Larson |year=2006 |title=American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide, Revised and Updated 3rd Edition |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470048425.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its publishing arm, the Academy has published such books and guides as ''Easy Gluten-Free'', ''ADA Pocket Guide to Eating Disorders'', ''ADA Pocket Guide to Lipid Disorders, Hypertension, Diabetes and Weight Management'', ''ADA Quick Guide to Drug-Supplement Interactions'' and ''Making Nutrition Your Business''.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt; It also maintains the site eatright.org.

In the 1980s, the Academy published the magazine Food/2 which had originally been created by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]. In response pressure from meat, egg, and dairy industries, the Department of Agriculture decided not publish it, after which the Academy negotiated with the government to publish it itself, omitting the controversial chapters on [[fat]] and [[cholesterol]].&lt;ref name=nytimesmagazine&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/19/garden/magazine-withheld-by-us-may-revive.html MAGAZINE WITHHELD BY U.S. MAY REVIVE].

May 19, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was widely criticized, with participating dietitians stating "it is just incredible that they would publish it without the most important part."&lt;ref name=nytimesmagazine/&gt;

==Certification==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics certification process offers two career options: Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and Nutrition and Dietetics Technician, Registered (NDTR). Both are educated nutrition professionals qualified to work in hospitals, academia and private practice, and differ mostly in the hours of training and level of college degree required. A Registered Dietitian Nutritionist must complete a bachelor's degree or higher and more than 900 hours of training, while a Dietetic Technician is required to complete and associate level degree and 450 hours of training.&lt;ref name=llu&gt;[http://www.llu.edu/allied-health/nutrition/faqs.page Frequently Asked Questions]. “What is the difference between a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and a Nutrition Dietetic Technician, Registered (NDTR) and what career opportunities are available for each?” (Information is provided by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics FAQs web page)&lt;/ref&gt; About 72% of the Academy's members are Registered Dietitian Nutritionists, and 2% are Nutrition Dietetic Technicians, Registered.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; Members are granted these accredited titles by fulfilling the Academy's strenuous certification requirements in addition to any state or local regulations. Through its ADAF foundation, the Academy issued nearly $500,000 in certification scholarships in 2011, $100,000 of which went to doctoral students.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt;

The terms “Registered Dietitian Nutritionist” and “Nutrition Dietetic Technician, Registered” are “legally protected titles” and can be used only by someone who has completed coursework approved by the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/ACEND/content.aspx?id=146#Mike_1 What is the difference between a registered dietitian or dietetic technician, registered, and a nutritionist?] ''EatRight.org''. “Registered dietitian or RD and dietetic technician, registered or DTR can only be used by dietetics practitioners who are currently authorized to use the credential by the Commission on Dietetic Registration of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. These are legally protected titles. Individuals with these credentials have completed specific academic and supervised practice requirements, successfully completed a registration examination and maintained requirements for recertification.”&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the AND has lobbied for stricter regulation over the professional licensing of dietitian and nutrition professionals and supported state regulations that would include heavy fines for the dispensing of nutritional advice without the proper license.&lt;ref name=forbesellsberg&gt;Ellsberg, Michael.

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics's Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) is the organization's accrediting agency for education programs that prepare individuals for careers as dietetics professionals. Prior to 2011{{Disputed inline|Questions about updating/correcting content in article|for=happening in 2013?|date=March 2018}}, ACEND was known as the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education (CADE).&lt;ref name=acend&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/ACEND/ About ACEND].

As of May 31, 2015, there were 575 programs accredited in the United States and five international programs.”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN)===
According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist is a “food and nutrition expert” who has fulfilled the minimum requirements for the titled RD.&lt;ref name=llu/&gt;

Requirements include the following items:
* Earning a bachelor's degree with course work approved by the Academys's Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). Coursework typically includes food and nutrition sciences, foodservice systems management, business, economics, computer science, sociology, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology and chemistry.
* Completing an accredited, supervised practice program at a health-care facility, community agency or foodservice corporation.
* Passing a national examination administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration.
* Completing continuing professional educational requirements to maintain registration.
* In addition to the costs of the college coursework, the Academy charges a $200 application fee for registered dietitians.&lt;ref name=nutritionistworld&gt;[http://www.nutritionist-world.com/ADA_registered_dietitian_regs.html National Requirements to Become a Registered Dietitian from the American Dietetic Association's (ADA) Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR)].

* Students must complete a 1,200 hour internship to sit for the Registered Dietitian exam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-07/special/chi-adveducation-dietetics-20120807_1_dietetics-nutrition-world-degree-program Graduates cooking up new ways to utilize degrees in dietetics - Chicago Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 50% of RDs hold advanced degrees. Some RDNs also hold additional certifications in specialized areas of practice, such as pediatric or renal nutrition, nutrition support and diabetes education.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; In addition to any Academy requirements (and often with some overlap),  many states have laws for dietitians and nutrition practitioners.&lt;ref name=eatrightmedia&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/Media/content.aspx?id=6442467510 What Is the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics?]. ''Eat Right''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition Dietetic Technician, Registered (NDTR)===
According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, NDTRs are “a food and nutrition practitioner” who has fulfilled the minimum requirements for the title NDTR.&lt;ref name=llu/&gt;

These requirements, while similar to an RD, differ in that they require:
* A minimum of an [[Associate of Science|Associate's]] degree.
* At least 450 hours of supervised practice accredited by ACEND.
* Successful pass a national DTR examination administered by CDR.
* Complete continuing professional educational requirements to maintain registration.

NDTR's typically work closely with RD in numerous employment settings such as hospitals, health care facilities, private practice, day care centers, correctional facilities and weight loss centers.&lt;ref name=llu/&gt; The Academy application fee to become an NDTR is $120.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nutritionist-world.com/ADA_registered_dietitian_regs.html National Requirements to Become a Registered Dietitian from the American Dietetic Association's (ADA) Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR)].

==Lobbying efforts and competitive protections==
To help better communications with the US government, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has offices in [[Washington, DC]]. They also operate their own [[political action committee]], the Academy's Political Action Committee.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt; The Academy spent $5.8 million lobbying at the state and national level from 2000–2010.&lt;ref name=opensecrets&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000023948&amp;year=2010 American Dietetic Assn]. ''Open Secrets''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1985 report noted the Academy has supported licensing for dispensing nutritional advice.&lt;ref name=washingtonpostlicensing&gt;Sugarman, Carole. "Licensing Nutrition Advisers." ''[[The Washington Post]]'' via [http://www.lexisnexis.com LexisNexis]. May 5, 1985. "And they want to make it illegal for individuals to offer nutrition advice without proper credentials [...] According to Catherine Babington, director of government affairs of the American Dietetic Association, dietitians in 36 states are pursuing mandatory licensure, although details of the proposed laws vary from state to state. A bill awaits the governor's signature in Maryland, while dietetic associations in Virginia and the District of Columbia are in the beginning stages of drafting such bills. [...] Opponents such as the National Health Federation, chaired by Donsbach, and the National Nutritional Foods Association, which represents more than 3,500 health food stores, contend that highly restrictive bills could create a monopoly for one school of traditional nutrition thought, limiting the free market and consumer choice, and that their primary intent is not to protect the public, but to give clout and recognition to a single segment of dietitians, increasing their chances of obtaining reimbursement from insurance companies."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to supporting legislation regulating the professional nutrition field in states like [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Hawaii]], [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], the Academy has also applied for patents for its certification titles such as: “Certified Nutrition Coach,” “Certified Nutrition Professional,” “Registered Nutrition Professional,” and “Certified Nutrition Educator.”&lt;ref name=forbesellsberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=wyomingdetective&gt;[http://www.wyomingdieteticassociation.com/rd_licensure.asp RD Licensure]. ''Wyoming Dietetic Association''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy states that by regulating who can provide nutritional counseling, they can protect their registered members and the public from unregulated advice or possibly inaccurate advice from less qualified dietary practitioners such as [[chiropractors]], [[yoga|yoga instructors]], [[homeopaths]], and [[personal trainers]].&lt;ref name=forbesellsberg/&gt; The Academy's support of this legislation has generated strong opposition from [[alternative medicine|alternative health practitioners]] and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] groups, who state that "highly restrictive bills could create a monopoly for one school of traditional nutrition thought" and that the primary intent of the bill is "not to protect the public, but to give clout and recognition to a single segment of dietitians, increasing their chances of obtaining reimbursement from insurance companies."&lt;ref name=forbesellsberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=washingtonpostlicensing/&gt;

==Kids Eat Right==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the ADA Foundation launched their first joint initiative, Kids Eat Right, in November 2010. This member-driven campaign is dedicated to supporting the efforts of the White House to end the childhood obesity epidemic within a generation.&lt;ref name="eatrightobama"/&gt; Kids Eat Right is a two-tiered campaign aimed to mobilize Academy members to participate in community and school childhood obesity prevention efforts, and also to educate families, communities, and policy makers about the importance of quality nutrition.

In 1982, the organization faced mass resignations from members over a decision to support President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s cuts in [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] and [[school lunch program]]s.&lt;ref name="nytimesmagazine"/&gt; The decision was largely a political trade-off; the Reagan administration agreed to drop its proposal to deregulate nursing homes in exchange for the Academy's support of the school lunch and food stamp cuts.&lt;ref name=nytimesmagazine/&gt;

===Criticism of partnerships with food companies===
A 1995 report noted the Academy received funding from companies like [[McDonald's]], [[PepsiCo]], [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], [[Abbott Nutrition]], [[General Mills]], [[Kellogg's]], [[Mars Inc.|Mars]], [[McNeil Nutritionals]], [[Pharmavite|SOYJOY]], [[Truvia]], [[Unilever]], and The [[Sugar Association]] as corporate sponsorship.&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_spending&gt;https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/coke-spends-lavishly-on-pediatricians-and-dietitians/&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy also partners with [[ConAgra Foods]], which produces [[Orville Redenbacker]], [[Slim Jim (snack food)|Slim Jims]], [[Hunt's|Hunt's Ketchup]], [[Hunt's Snack Pack|SnackPacks]], and [[Hebrew National|Hebrew National hot dogs]], to maintain the American Dietetic Association/ConAgra Foods Home Food Safety...It's in Your Hands program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20051110005755/en/Timely-Turkey-Tips-Buying-Baking-American-Dietetic Timely Turkey Tips from Buying to Baking; American Dietetic Association/ConAgra Foods offer Home Food Safety Help for Thanksgiving Cooks]. ''Business Wire''. November 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Academy earns revenue from corporations by selling space at its booth during conventions, doing this for [[soft drinks]] and [[candy]] makers.&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal/&gt;&lt;ref name=thedailygreen&gt;Nestle, Marion. [http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/blogs/healthy-food/marion-nestle-ADA-politics-44031808 The ADA and Corporate Sponsors: An Unhealthy Alliance?]. ''The Daily Green''. March 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, a dietitian working on a panel charged with setting policy on [[genetically modified foods]] for the academy contended she was removed for pointing out that two of its members had ties to [[Monsanto]], one of the biggest makers of [[genetically modified seeds]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/business/a-dismissal-raises-questions-about-objectivity-on-food-policy.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting controversy highlighted the fact that Ms. Smith Edge, chairwoman of the committee charged with developing the GMO policy, is a senior vice president at the [[International Food Information Council]], which is largely financed by food, beverage and agriculture businesses, including companies like [[DuPont]], [[Bayer CropScience]] and [[Cargill]], companies that were among the biggest financial opponents of a [[State of California GMO labeling initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/04/gmo-dieticians-monsanto-california&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy maintains that being at the "same table" with food companies is important in order to exert a positive influence over their products and message, although critics describe this as an “unhealthy alliance” between the Academy and [[junk food]] companies.&lt;ref name="thedailygreen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fooducate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fooducate.com/blog/2010/08/01/ada-response-to-accusations-on-partnership-with-hershey/ |title=ADA Response to Accusations on Partnership with Hershey |publisher=Fooducate |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation is that despite what good may come of such programs, it ultimately [[whitewash]]es (similar to the [[greenwashing]] efforts of environmentally irresponsible companies) the brand's role in the country's food ecosystem. Watchdogs note that the Academy rarely criticizes food companies, believing it to be out of fear of "biting the hand that feeds them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rampton |first1=Sheldon | author1link = Sheldon Rampton|last2=Stauber|first2=John | author2link =John Stauber|year=2001 |title=Trust Us, We're Experts!: How Industry Manipulates Science and Gambles With Your Future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_OEPBt16JscC&amp;pg=PT143&amp;lpg=PT143&amp;dq=%22never+criticize+the+food+industry%22++Joan+Gussow&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_5qA8Ppkcq&amp;sig=qISVPbsLwFuwTq_YsevqSng5BEU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UzSXT8SYDeGe2QXuyrDXDQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22never%20criticize%20the%20food%20industry%22%20%20Joan%20Gussow&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PR Watch"&gt;[http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/2000Q4/dairy.html Who Is the Dairy Coalition?

'''Action assembly theory''' ('''AAT''') is a [[communication theory]] that emphasizes [[psychology|psychological]] and social influences on human action. The goal is to examine and describe the links between the [[cognition]] and [[behavior]] – how an individual's thoughts get transformed into action. It was developed by John Greene.&lt;ref&gt;Em Griffen. ''A First Look at Communication Theory''. "Chapter 11: [http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/action.pdf Action Assembly Theory of John Greene]." McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Action assembly theory describes the production of behavior in two essential processes: 
* the retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory, and
* the organization of these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken.
* Action Assembly Theory (AAT) seeks to explain message behavior (both verbal and nonverbal).  AAT is a communication theory that emphasizes psychological and social influences on human action.  The goal is to examine and describe the links between the cognition and behavior-how an individuals thoughts get transformed into action.  According to the psychology wiki, AAT describes the production of behavior in two essential processes: the retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory, and the organization of these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken. For example, assembly is considered a top-to-bottom process that begins with more general strategy and goes to a more specific idea about communicating the specific message.

== Retrieval of procedural elements ==
The idea of procedural record is at the center of action assembly.  These records contain information about action, outcomes, and situations.  These records are locked in the individual’s memory where it remembers past behaviors for the future.

A procedural record is at the center of action assembly. It is a personal nugget of truth about past behavior stockpiled for future use, part of an individual's memory system in which information about how to execute various behaviors is stored. Procedural records contain information about action, outcomes, and situations; for example, traveling at excessive speed (action) in a zone that specifies low speed limit (situation)can result in the issuance of a ticket (outcome).

Procedural records have different levels of strength. Some are mere scratches that barely leave a trace in the mind, while others are well-worn into long-term memory.

A central aspect of the action assembly theory is specifying the processes that link procedural records to behavioral representations. The activation process is the process used to select particular procedural records. For example, if a parent disciplined a child for stealing, all procedural records relevant to this goal and situation would be activated. In turn, if a common disciplinary tactic was to take away toys and play items, a procedural record of that would be activated quickly.

== Organization of procedural elements ==
It is also important to consider the process of assembly, which organizes records into a behavioral representation. For example, assembly is considered a top-down process that begins with general strategy and goes to more specific ideas about communicating the specific message.

Action assembly theory has been useful for topics such as speech onset latency and hesitations during speaking. These concepts are assumed to be indicators of cognitive processing. Another use is the study of planning – individuals who plan more effectively are more fluent than those do not, because planning reduces the cognitive load at the time of message production.

When an interaction situation has multiple goals, the theory finds increased demands on an individual's information processing capacity. Assembly of goals may be difficult because a specific goals may be incompatible with behaviors associated with the other goals. In turn, multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitations and latencies. The utilization of Action Assembly theory can provide a clear opportunity to plan or assemble  goals more careful to mitigate the effect.

== Use of AAT==
When an interaction situation has multiple goals, the theory finds increased demands on an individual’s information processing capacity.  Assembly of goals may be difficult because a specific goal may be incompatible with behaviors associated with each other goals.  In turn, multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitation.  The utilization of AAT can provide a clear opportunity to plan or assemble goals more careful to ease the effect.

==Education==
He graduated with a degree in theoretical physics as an undergraduate (Laurea) at [[Ghislieri College]] and the [[University of Pavia]], he then obtained a [[PhD]] in astronomy from the [[University of Milan]] in 1996, where he worked with [[Bruno Bertotti]], one of [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s last students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/~av/ |title=Alberto Vecchio |publisher=University of Birmingham |website=School of Physics and Astronomy |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LIGO==
Working in collaboration with other scientists at University of Birmingham, he helped build and test instruments to detect gravitational waves. After these were improved further as part of the Advanced LIGO upgrade, gravitational waves were detected. These instruments allowed the properties of the sources from the gravitational wave signatures to be extracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stfc.ac.uk/news/gravitational-waves/ |title=Gravitational waves detected! |date=11 February 2016 |website=Science and Technology Facilities Council |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And they all require unprecedented levels of safety (e.g., [[automobile safety]]) and security,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/01/worried-about-cybersecurity-and-the-connected-car-theres-a-bill-for-that/|title=Worried about cybersecurity and the connected car?

As an example, the [[autonomous car]] both addresses the main existing safety issues and creates new issues. It is expected to be much safer than existing vehicles, by eliminating the single most dangerous element{{snd}}the driver. The US's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 94 percent of US accidents were the result of [[human error]] and poor decision-making, including speeding and impaired driving,&lt;ref name="moral dilemma"/&gt; and the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School claims that "Some ninety percent of motor vehicle crashes are caused at least in part by human error".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2013/12/human-error-cause-vehicle-crashes |title=Human error as a cause of vehicle crashes |author=Bryant Walker Smith |date=December 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while safety standards like the [[ISO 26262]] specify the required safety, there is still a burden on the industry to demonstrate acceptable safety.

While car accidents claim every year 35,000 lives in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812348 |title=Quick Facts 2015 |work=[[US DOT]] |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.25&amp;nbsp;million worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/mortality/en/|title=Road traffic deaths|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; some{{Who|date=August 2017}} believe that even "a car that's 10 times as safe, which means 3,500 people die on the roads each year [in the US alone]" would not be accepted by the public.&lt;ref name="moral dilemma"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/02/20/the-big-moral-dilemma-facing-self-driving-cars/ |title=The big moral dilemma facing self-driving cars |author=Steven Overly |quote="[..] Would we accept that?" asks John Hanson, a spokesman for the Toyota Research Institute, which is developing the automaker's self-driving technology. |date=February 20, 2017 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptable level may be closer to the current figures on [[aviation accidents and incidents]], with under a thousand worldwide deaths in most years&lt;ref&gt;"Death Rate per Year".

This underscores the unprecedented nature of the safety requirements that will need to be met for cars, with similar levels of safety expected for other Autonomous Things.

The '''BIM Collaboration Format''' ('''BCF''') is a structured file format which allows [[Issue_tracking_system|issue tracking]] with a [[Building information modeling|building information model]]. BCF is designed primarily for attaching information to collisions and errors connected with specific objects in a model, but can be used for general issue tracking in building construction projects. This allows developers of BIM-supporting software to design interfaces for collaboration between users who access the same model, especially with different software.

The format was developed by Tekla and Solibri and later adopted as a standard by [[buildingSMART]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/bcf-releases |title=BCF intro |website=www.buildingsmart-tech.org |language=en |access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable software with native support for BCF are Solibri, Tekla with plugins which provide usability for other software.

[[File:TsIAM logo.png|right|Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development logo|alt= Institute logo: the Russian letters ''tse, i, a and em'']]
The P. I. '''Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development''' (also known as the "Central Institute for Aviation Motor Development named after P. I. Baranov" or simply "Central Institute of Aviation Motors", CIAM or TsIAM, ''Tsentralniy Institut Aviatsionnogo Motorostroeniya'', {{lang-ru|Центральный Институт Авиационного Моторостроения}}) is the only specialized Russian research and engineering facility dealing with advanced aerospace propulsion research, aircraft engine [[Product certification|certification]] and other [[Gas-dynamic|gas dynamics]]-related issues. It was founded in 1930.

CIAM operates the largest aerospace engine testing facility in [[Europe]], surpassed only by the United States's [[Arnold Engineering Development Center]] and [[Glenn Research Center]]. It is based in [[Lefortovo District|Lefortovo]] (the southeast okrug of [[Moscow]]) with an address of 2 [[Aviamotornaya (street)|Aviamotornaya]] street, Moscow, [[Postcode]] 111116. CIAM also operates a scientific testing center in [[Lytkarino]], [[Moscow Oblast]].

== History ==
The bases of the institute were formed by such academics as [[Mstislav Keldysh|Keldysh]], [[Klimov]] and [[Vladimir Chelomei|Chelomey]]. Since its foundation in 1930, CIAM designed nearly all Russian aviation motors and gas turbines. In 1933 CIAM was named after the late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Vice-[[Council of People's Commissars|Narkom]] of [[Heavy Industry]] Petr Ionovich Baranov, who was one of the leading theorists of the Soviet aviation industry. Before [[World War II]], all engine-design work was transferred to mass-production motor-building plants and their own [[design bureau]]s. CIAM focused on theoretical and experimental research and modernization of prototypes up to the production stage.

After the war, CIAM was engaged with reactive (jet) engines for airplanes, successors to the first-generation [[turbojet]]s. In the early 1950s, the largest test base in Europe was built in Lytkarino. In the 1970s, the institute began work on a [[ramjet]] engine using the special [[hypersonic]] "flying laboratory" [[GLL Holod]]. This experiment used a [[liquid hydrogen]], actively cooled dual-mode ramjet, which was based on a hydrogen-fueled axisymmetrical engine placed on a Russian [[SA-5 Gammon|SA5]] missile during the flight. The first successful test achieved Mach 5.6 in 1991, and the maximum speed achieved was Mach 5.7 in November 1992. A test with a goal of Mach 6.3 failed in March 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=Paper&amp;gID=30313 French-Russian Analysis of Kholod Dual-Mode Ramjet Flight Experiments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181756/http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=Paper&amp;gID=30313 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the USSR]], CIAM lost a large number of emigrating engineers. With the loss of government support and a lack of state aviation strategy, CIAM stayed afloat with contracts with China, French corporations, [[ABB Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]] and by offering logistical services. As of 2011, the situation has stabilized; CIAM leads some Russian programs, including development of the new perspective [[scramjet]] [[GLL Igla]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netwrx1.com/skunk-works/v02.n027 French Support Russian SCRAMJET Tests.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224171520/http://www.netwrx1.com/skunk-works/v02.n027 |date=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also researches [[gas pipeline]]s; in March 2006, the institute signed an agreement with JSC [[Gasprom]].

[[Image:Yellow-rattle close 700.jpg|thumb|right|Papery (upper) and leafy bracts on hay rattle (''[[Rhinanthus minor]]'').  All the "leaves" in this image are bracts.]]
In [[botany]], a '''bract''' is a modified or specialized [[leaf]], especially one associated with a reproductive structure such as a [[flower]], [[inflorescence]] axis or [[cone scale]]. Bracts are often (but not always) different from foliage leaves. They may be smaller, larger, or of a different color, shape, or texture. Typically, they also look different from the parts of the flower, such as the petals or [[sepals]]. The state of having bracts is referred to as '''bracteate'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bracteate|title=the definition of bracteate|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-04-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428051604/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bracteate|archivedate=2017-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bracteolate''', and conversely the state of lacking them is referred to as '''ebracteate'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greengonzo.com/dictionary/Ebractiate.html|title=Definition of Ebractate|website=www.greengonzo.com|access-date=2017-04-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428052240/http://www.greengonzo.com/dictionary/Ebractiate.html|archivedate=2017-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''ebracteolate''', without bracts.

==Variants==

Some bracts are brightly-coloured and serve the function of attracting pollinators, either together with the [[perianth]] or instead of it. Examples of this type of bract include ''[[Euphorbia pulcherrima]]'' (poinsettia) and ''[[Bougainvillea]]'': both of these have large colourful bracts surrounding much smaller, less colourful flowers.

In grasses, each floret (flower) is enclosed in a pair of papery bracts, called the '''lemma''' (lower bract) and '''palea''' (upper bract), while each spikelet (group of florets) has a further pair of bracts at its base called '''glumes'''.  These bracts form the [[chaff]] removed from [[cereal]] grain during [[threshing]] and [[winnowing]].

Bats may detect acoustic signals from dish-shaped bracts such as those of ''[[Marcgravia evenia]]''.&lt;ref name=Simon11&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ralph Simon|author2=Marc W. Holderied|author3=Corinna U. Koch|author4=Otto von Helversen|title=Floral acoustics: Conspicuous echoes of a dish-shaped leaf attract bat pollinators|journal=Science|volume= 333| issue=6042|pages=631–633|DOI=10.1126/science.1204210|pmid=21798950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prophyll''' is a leaf-like structure, such as a bracteole, subtending (extending under) a single flower or [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]. The term can also mean the lower bract on a [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]].

The frequently showy pair of bracts of ''[[Euphorbia]]'' species in subgenus ''Lacanthis'' are the '''cyathophylls'''.

Bracts subtend the cone scales in the seed cones of many [[conifer]]s, and in some cases, such as ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'', they extend beyond the cone scales.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Bracteole==
A small bract is called a '''bracteole''' or '''bractlet'''. Technically this is any bract that arises ''on'' a pedicel instead of subtending it.

== Involucral bracts ==
[[Image:Leafy-bract-Beggar-ticks.we.jpg|100px|right|thumb|Beggar-tick (''[[Bidens comosa]]'')]]

Bracts that appear in a [[Whorl (botany)|whorl]] subtending an [[inflorescence]] are collectively called an '''involucre'''. An involucre is a common feature beneath the inflorescences of many [[Apiaceae]], [[Asteraceae]], [[Dipsacaceae]] and [[Polygonaceae]]. Each flower in an inflorescence may have its own whorl of bracts, in this case called an '''involucel'''. In this case they may be called ''chaff'', ''paleas'', or ''receptacular bracts'' and are usually minute scales or bristles.  Many [[Asteraceae|asteraceous]] plants have bracts at the base of each inflorescence.

The term involucre is also used for a highly conspicuous bract or bract pair at the base of an inflorescence. In the family [[Betulaceae]], notably in the genera ''[[hornbeam|Carpinus]]'' and ''[[hazel|Corylus]]'', the '''involucre''' is a leafy structure that protects the developing nuts. Beggar-tick (''[[Bidens comosa]]'') has narrow involucral bracts surrounding each inflorescence, each of which also has a single bract below it. There is then a pair of leafy bracts on the main stem and below those a pair of leaves.

==Epicalyx==
[[Image:Hibiscus rosa-sinensis3 ies.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Epicalyx of ''[[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis]]'']]
 
An epicalyx, which forms an additional whorl around the [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of a single flower, is a modification of bracteoles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darpan|first=Pratiyogita|title=Competition Science Vision|date=June 2006|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the epicalyx is a ''group of bracts resembling a calyx'' or ''bracteoles forming a whorl outer to the calyx''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/books/12/std12-botany-em.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214091359/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/12/Std12-Botany-EM.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a calyx-like extra whorl of floral appendages.  Each individual segment of the epicalyx is called an '''episepal''' because they resemble the sepals in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://botanydictionary.org/epicalyx.html |title=epicalyx – Dictionary of botany |publisher=Botanydictionary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120501223013/http://botanydictionary.org/epicalyx.html |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are present in the [[Malvaceae]], the ''Hibiscus'' family. ''[[Fragaria]]'' (strawberries) may or may not have an epicalyx.
{{clear}}

==Spathe==
[[Image:Anthurium scherzerianum 2.jpg|right|100px|thumb|''[[Anthurium]] scherzerianum'' [[inflorescence]] with spathe and [[spadix (botany)|spadix]]]]

A ''spathe'' is a large bract or pair of bracts forming a sheath to enclose the flower cluster of such plants as [[Arecaceae|palm]]s, [[arum]]s, [[Iris (plant)|irises]],&lt;ref name=Lynch&gt;Richard Lynch {{Google books|grvYTul5CSUC|The Book of the Iris|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crocus]]es,&lt;ref&gt;Alex Casha {{Google books|Poo9CgAAQBAJ|Flora of the Maltese Islands|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dayflower]]s (''Commelina''). ''[[Habranthus tubispathus]]'' in the [[Amaryllidaceae]] derives its [[botanical nomenclature|specific name]] from its tuberous spathe. In many arums ([[Araceae]] family), the spathe is petal-like, attracting pollinators to the flowers arranged on a type of spike called a [[spadix (botany)|spadix]].

'''Brevibacterium iodinum''' is a [[Gram-positive]] [[soil]] [[bacterium]]. It can often be found among the normal [[skin flora|cutaneous flora]] of healthy people, particularly in humid environments, and is only very rarely involved in [[opportunistic infection]]s. It is also suspected to be a cause of [[foot odor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=S.|first=Antoniou|title=Brevibacterium iodinum Peritonitis Associated with Acute Urticaria in a CAPD Patient|url=http://www.pdiconnect.com/cgi/reprint/17/6/614.pdf|publisher=www.pdiconnect.com|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thy-1''' or '''CD90''' ('''C'''luster of '''D'''ifferentiation '''90''') is a 25–37 k[[Atomic mass unit|Da]] heavily N-glycosylated, [[glycophosphatidylinositol]] (GPI) anchored conserved cell surface [[protein]] with a single V-like [[immunoglobulin domain]], originally discovered as a [[thymocyte]] antigen. Thy-1 can be used as a marker for a variety of [[stem cell]]s and for the [[axon|axonal processes]] of mature [[neuron]]s. Structural study of Thy-1 led to the foundation of the [[Immunoglobulin superfamily]], of which it is the smallest member, and led to some of the initial biochemical description and characterization of a vertebrate GPI anchor and also the first demonstration of tissue specific differential glycosylation.

== Discovery and nomenclature ==

The antigen Thy-1 was the first T cell marker  to be identified. Thy-1 was discovered  by Reif and Allen in 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reif AE, Allen JM | title = The AKR thymic antigen and its distribution in leukemias and nervous tissue | journal = J. Exp. Med. | volume = 120 | pages = 413–433 | year = 1964 | doi = 10.1084/jem.120.3.413 | pmid = 14207060 | pmc = 2137766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during a search for heterologous antisera against mouse [[leukemia]] cells, and was demonstrated by them to be present on murine thymocytes, on T lymphocytes, and on neuronal cells.  It was originally named theta (θ) antigen, then Thy-1 ('''THYmocyte differentiation antigen 1''') due to its prior identification in thymocytes (precursors of [[T cell]]s in the [[thymus]]). The human homolog was isolated in 1980 as a 25kDa protein (p25) of T-lymphoblastoid cell line MOLT-3 binding with anti-monkey-thymocyte antisera.&lt;ref name="pmid6153212"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ades EW, Zwerner RK, Acton RT, Balch CM | title = Isolation and partial characterization of the human homologue of Thy-1 | journal = J. Exp. Med. | volume = 151 | issue = 2 | pages = 400–6 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6153212 | doi = 10.1084/jem.151.2.400 | pmc = 2185777 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of Thy-1 in mice and humans led to the subsequent discovery of many other T cell markers, which is very significant to the field of [[immunology]] since T cells (along with B cells) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response.&lt;ref name="pmid6153212" /&gt;

== The conserved gene and its alleles ==
Thy-1 has been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution and even in some invertebrates, with [[homology (biology)|homologs]] described in many species like [[squid]], [[frog]]s, [[chicken]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s, [[dog]]s, and [[human]]s.

The Thy-1 gene is located at human [[chromosome 11]]q22.3 (mouse chromosome 9qA5.1). In [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=human&amp;term=thy1&amp;submit=Go AceView], it covers 6.82 kb, from 119294854 to 119288036 (NCBI 37, August 2010), on the reverse strand. This locus is very close to [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] &amp; CD56/[[Neural cell adhesion molecule|NCAM]] genes. Some believe that there may be a functional significance of both this gene and CD3 delta subunit (T3D) mapping to chromosome 11q in man and chromosome 9 in mouse, though there is no homology (in fact this speculation lead to its localization in chromosome 11q - the human chromosome region syntenic to mouse chromosome 9 which harbored T3D). In mice, there are two [[allele]]s: Thy1.1 (Thy 1a, CD90.1) and Thy1.2 (Thy 1b, CD90.2). They differ by only one [[amino acid]] at position 108; an arginine in Thy-1.1 and a glutamine in Thy-1.2. Thy 1.2 is expressed by most strains of mice, whereas Thy1.1 is expressed by some like AKR/J and PL [[Mouse#Taxonomy of the genus Mus|mouse strain]]s.

==The Protein==
The 25-kDa core protein (excluding the heavy glycosylation) of rodent Thy-1 is 111 or 112 amino acids in length, and is N-glycosylated at three sites (In contrast to only two glycosylation sites for human Thy-1). The 162aa (murine, 161 for human) Thy1 precursor has 19 amino acid (aa 1-19) [[signal peptide|signal sequence]] and 31 amino acid (aa 132-162) C-terminal transmembrane domain that is present in pro form but removed when transferring the 112 amino acid (aa 20-131) mature peptide to GPI anchor which would attach through the aa 131.

Some of the common monoclonal [[antibody|antibodies]] used to detect this protein are clones OX7, 5E10, K117 and L127.
There have been some reports of Thy1 monoclonal antibodies cross reacting with some cytoskeletal elements: anti Thy-1.2 with [[actin]] in marsupial, murine, and human cells and anti Thy-1.1 with [[vimentin]], and were suggested to be due to sequence homology by studies done more than 20 years back.&lt;ref name="pmid6136544"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dales S, Fujinami RS, Oldstone MB | title = Serologic relatedness between Thy-1.2 and actin revealed by monoclonal antibody | journal = J. Immunol. | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pages = 1332–8 |date=September 1983 | pmid = 6136544 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thy-1, like many other GPI anchored proteins can be shed by special types of [[Phospholipase C]] e.g. PI-PLC (phosphatidyl-Inositol Phospholipase C, or PLC β). it can also be involved in cell to cell transfer of GPI anchored proteins like [[CD55]] and [[CD59]].

==Glycosylation==
Thy-1 is one of the most heavily glycosylated membrane proteins with a carbohydrate content up to 30% of its molecular mass.&lt;ref name="pmid2888493"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pont S | title = Thy-1: a lymphoid cell subset marker capable of delivering an activation signal to mouse T lymphocytes | journal = Biochimie | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 315–20 | year = 1987 | pmid = 2888493 | doi = 10.1016/0300-9084(87)90022-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thy1 in most species has 3 N-glycosylation sites (Asn 23, 74 and 98) but no O-glycosylation. The composition of Thy-1 carbohydrate moieties varies considerably between different tissues or even among cells of the same lineage at different stages of differentiation: e.g., galactosamine only in brain Thy-1, sialic acid in thymic Thy-1 in far excess than brain Thy-1, that too increasing in parallel with T cell maturation. In this regard it has yet another historic association: Thy1 happens to be the first glycoprotein in which cell type specificity of variant glycosylation on an invariant protein was demonstrated. Analysis of Differencial glycosylation  of Thy-1  from  brain  and  thymus showed that all the  complex  N-linked  structures  differed between  the  two  forms, superimposed  upon  a  site specific  common core. In case of Thy1 this core pattern was constituted by  Asn23  carrying mostly  oligomannose  structures,  Asn74 carrying the  most  extended  complex  structures,  and  Asn98  carrying  smaller  complex structure. The structure of the sugar residues in the GPI anchor and their associated esterified structures (e.g. additional fatty acids and alcohols) also can be cell type and species specific.

==Expression==
Thy1 expression varies between species. Amongst the cells reported to generally express Thy-1 are [[thymocytes]] (precursor of T cells in the [[thymus]]) &amp; [[CD34]](+) prothymocytes; [[neuron]]s, [[mesenchymal stem cells]], [[hematopoietic stem cells]], [[NK cell]]s, murine [[T-cell]]s, [[endothelium]] (mainly in [[high endothelial venule]]s or HEVs where diapedesis takes place), renal [[glomerulus|glomerular]] [[mesangial cell]]s, circulating metastatic [[melanoma]] cells, [[follicular dendritic cell]]s (FDC), a fraction of [[fibroblast]]s and [[myofibroblast]]s.

===Detailed expression of Thy-1===
* In mice, Thy-1 is also found on thymocytes, peripheral T cells, myoblasts, epidermal cells, and keratinocytes. It is one of the '''"pan T cell markers"'''(of mice) like [[CD2]], [[CD5 (protein)|CD5]] and [[CD28]].
* In humans, Thy-1 is also expressed by endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, a subset of CD34+ bone marrow cells, and umbilical cord blood-, cardiac fibroblasts, and fetal liver-derived hemopoietic cells.
* Thy-1 is present on a fraction of brain cells and a fraction of [[fibroblast]]s of most vertebrate species studied.
* '''Nervous tissue''': Thy-1 expression in the nervous system is predominantly neuronal, but some glial cells also express Thy-1 especially at later stages of their differentiation. One study compared Thy-1 expression in four human neuronal cell lines, two neuroglial cell lines, and fresh tumor cells of neuronal origin and found three of the four neuronal cell lines, all of the neuroglial cell lines, and 80% of the tumors to be strongly positive for Thy-1.&lt;ref name="pmid6121610"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kemshead JT, Ritter MA, Cotmore SF, Greaves MF | title = Human Thy-1: expression on the cell surface of neuronal and glial cells | journal = Brain Res. | volume = 236 | issue = 2 | pages = 451–61 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6121610 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(82)90727-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain part specific ELISA reports are available which show highest concentrations of Thy1 protein in the [[striatum]] and [[hippocampus]], followed by the [[neocortex]], [[cerebellum]], [[spinal cord]], and the [[retina]] and [[optic nerve]]. Thy1 promoter has often been assumed to be "brain specific". "Neuron specific" mouse thy1 promoter has been used to drive "brain specific" forced expression of proteins e.g. mutated [[Amyloid precursor protein]](APP) as transgenic animal models of [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="pmid10037741"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moechars D, Dewachter I, Lorent K, Reversé D, Baekelandt V, Naidu A, Tesseur I, Spittaels K, Haute CV, Checler F, Godaux E, Cordell B, Van Leuven F | title = Early phenotypic changes in transgenic mice that overexpress different mutants of amyloid precursor protein in brain | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 274 | issue = 10 | pages = 6483–92 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10037741 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.274.10.6483| url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/274/10/6483 | format = abstract page }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thy-1 expression in the brain is developmentally regulated. Thy-1 levels in the neonatal rat brain, as well as the developing human brain, are low compared to adult brain. During the first few weeks of postnatal development, Thy-1 levels increase exponentially as the brain matures.
*'''Lymphoid tissue''' Thy-1 expression is highly variable between species. In humans, Thy-1 expression is restricted to only a small population of cortical thymocytes&lt;ref name="pmid7462633"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKenzie JL, Fabre JW | title = Human thy-1: unusual localization and possible functional significance in lymphoid tissues | journal = J. Immunol. | volume = 126 | issue = 3 | pages = 843–50 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7462633 | doi = | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/126/3/843 | format = abstract page }}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''not''' expressed in mature human T cells.&lt;ref name="pmid9749990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saalbach A, Kraft R, Herrmann K, Haustein UF, Anderegg U | title = The monoclonal antibody AS02 recognizes a protein on human fibroblasts being highly homologous to Thy-1 | journal = Arch.

Biol. | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = R774–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9382830 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(06)00402-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mouse cortical thymocytes express higher levels of Thy-1 than medullary thymocytes which in turn express more than lymph node cells (~200,000 copies/cell). A similar inverse developmental temporal expression profile is seen in rats T cells, although rat Thy-1 is lost at an earlier stage of T cell maturation.&lt;ref name="pmid2868157"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crawford JM, Barton RW | title = Thy-1 glycoprotein: structure, distribution, and ontogeny | journal = Lab. Invest. | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 122–35 | year = 1986 | pmid = 2868157 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thy-1 is only expressed on thymocytes in rats (contrast to thymocytes and splenocytes in mice). The third intron of the mouse Thy-1 gene has a 36 base pair region that recruits nuclear transcription factors, such as Ets-1-like NF, expressed in thymocytes and splenocytes. The homologous region of the rat gene lacks the Ets-1-like NF binding site, but instead binds another NF expressed in rat thymocytes but not splenocytes.

===Induction of Thy-1 expression===
*Agents shown to induce Thy1 expression include: [[Thymopoietin]], [[thymosin]], [[prostaglandins]], [[nerve growth factor]], [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]], [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]], [[Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate|PMA]], Ca2+ ionophore, and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] (DAG).&lt;ref name="pmid15356100"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haeryfar SM, Hoskin DW | title = Thy-1: more than a mouse pan-T cell marker | journal = J. Immunol. | volume = 173 | issue = 6 | pages = 3581–8 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15356100 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.173.6.3581| url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/173/6/3581 | format = abstract page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Localization==
As a [[Glycophosphatidylinositol|GPI-anchored protein]], Thy-1 is present in the outer leaflet of [[lipid raft]]s in the cell membrane. In case of [[neuron]]s it is known to be expressed strongly in the mature axon. The [[axon hillock]] can act as a barrier for its lateral spread even though it has no transmembrane segment. Thy-1 has been suggested to interact with G inhibitory proteins, the Src family kinase (SFK) member c-fyn, and tubulin within lipid rafts. In rats and mice, Thy-1 protein is present on the soma (cell body) and dendrites of neurons but is not expressed on axons until axonal growth is complete, and is again temporarily suppressed during axonal injury. [[HIV-1]] Matrix co-localizes with Thy-1 in lipid rafts, the site of virus particle budding from cells, and Thy-1 is incorporated into virus particles as a result of this process.

==Function==
The function of Thy-1 has not yet been fully elucidated. It has  speculated roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, with implication in neurite outgrowth, nerve regeneration, [[apoptosis]], [[metastasis]], [[inflammation]], and [[fibrosis]].

===Role in cognition===
The Thy-1 knockout (KO) mice are viable and appear grossly normal. They display normal social interactions and normal learning in a maze, but fail to learn from social cues (e.g. learning from other mice which foods are safe to eat as compared to wild-type mice). This failure can be rescued by the transgenic expression of Thy-1 or pharmacologic treatment with a GABA (A) receptor antagonists. This suggests that Thy-1 KO mice have excessive GABAergic inhibition in the dentate gyrus and regional inhibition of long-term potentiation.

===Axon growth regulation===
Crosslinking anti-Thy-1 Ab can promote neurite outgrowth which is dependent on G{alpha}i and L- and N-type calcium channel activation. The ligand for promotion of neurite outgrowth on astrocytes is not yet identified, but the inhibitory ligand has been suggested to be integrins. Thy1 is one of the known ligands of beta 3 [[integrin]]s. Interaction of thy1 expressed on maturing [[axon]]s with beta 3 integrins expressed on mature astrocytes may be the cause of halting of axon growth.

===T-cell activation===
Crosslinking Thy-1 molecules in the membrane raft, in the context of strong costimulatory signaling through CD28 in mouse T cells can act to some extent as a substitute activating signal for T-cell receptor signaling. Conversely it can substitute CD28 costimulation for activation through the TCR.&lt;ref name="pmid15356100"/&gt;

===Apoptosis/Necrosis===
Cross linking antibody induced aggregation of Thy1 cause death of thymocytes and mesangial cells mainly by [[apoptosis]] despite Bcl2 upregulation. The death of mesangial cells seems to be apoptosis by TUNEL staining or annexin V staining, but electron microscopy suggest it is [[necrosis]].

====Antibody target for animal model of Glomerulonephritis====
Single tail vein intravenous injection of antibody (OX7 mouse [[monoclonal]] IgG) against Thy1.1 in rats is used as a standard animal model to produce experimental mesangioproliferative [[glomerulonephritis]]&lt;ref name="pmid2892961"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamamoto T, Wilson CB | title = Quantitative and qualitative studies of antibody-induced mesangial cell damage in the rat | journal = Kidney Int. | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 514–25 | year = 1987 | pmid = 2892961 | doi = 10.1038/ki.1987.240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is popularly known in the field of [[nephrology]] as ''antiThy1 GN''.

===Tumor suppression===
It has also been proven to be a [[tumor suppressor]] for some tumors.&lt;ref name="pmid12781446"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abeysinghe HR, Cao Q, Xu J, Pollock S, Veyberman Y, Guckert NL, Keng P, Wang N | title = THY1 expression is associated with tumor suppression of human ovarian cancer | journal = Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. | volume = 143 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–32 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12781446 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-4608(02)00855-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It probably is aided by its action in upregulating [[thrombospondin]], SPARC ([[osteonectin]]), and [[fibronectin]]. However it has also been speculated to aid in extravasation in circulating melanoma cells. In case of prostate cancer it has been shown to be expressed in cancer associated stroma but not in normal stroma and has been suggested to be of potential help for cancer specific drug targeting [http://www3.niddk.nih.gov/fund/other/cellularniche/poster%20abstracts/True%20Abstract%20ormatted.pdf].

===Role in cell adhesion, extravasation, migration===
Acting through several integrins and probably a few yet unknown other receptors Thy-1 mediates adhesion of leukocytes and monocytes to endothelial cells and fibroblasts, melanoma cells to endothelium, and thymocytes to thymic epithelium.&lt;ref name="pmid16770003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rege TA, Hagood JS | title = Thy-1 as a regulator of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in axon regeneration, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, cancer, and fibrosis | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | pages = 1045–54 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16770003 | doi = 10.1096/fj.05-5460rev }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thy1 expression comes on when endothelial cells are activated. It has been shown to interact with the leukocyte integrin Mac1 (CD11b/CD18) and may play a role in leukocyte homing and recruitment.&lt;ref name="pmid15004192"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wetzel A, Chavakis T, Preissner KT, Sticherling M, Haustein UF, Anderegg U, Saalbach A | title = Human Thy-1 (CD90) on activated endothelial cells is a counterreceptor for the leukocyte integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) | journal = J. Immunol. | volume = 172 | issue = 6 | pages = 3850–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15004192 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3850| url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/172/6/3850 | format = abstract page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modulating fibrosis===
Role of Thy-1 in fibrosis and fibroblast differention may have some tissue variation. In lung fibrosis Thy-1 level is suppressed in stimulated fibroblasts. Thy1 knock out mice have increased fibrosis in the lung. Fibrosis induced by radiation mimicking chemotherapeutic agent [[Bleomycin]] is also increased in these mice.

==Other roles==
Thy-1 knock out mice also show impaired cutaneous immune responses and abnormal retinal development: thinning of the inner nuclear, inner plexiform, ganglion cell, and outer segment layers of the retina.

==Use in stem cell biology==
Thy-1 can be considered as a surrogate marker for various kind of [[stem cell]]s (e.g. [[hematopoietic stem cells]] or HSCs). It is one of the popular combinatorial surface markers for [[Fluorescent-activated cell sorting|FACS]] for stem cells in combination with other markers like [[CD34]]. In humans, Thy-1 is expressed on neurons and HSCs among others. It is considered a major marker of HSC pluripotency in concordance with CD34. In human HSCs, Thy1 cells are all CD34 positive.&lt;ref name="pmid20688981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boitano AE, Wang J, Romeo R, Bouchez LC, Parker AE, Sutton SE, Walker JR, Flaveny CA, Perdew GH, Denison MS, Schultz PG, Cooke MP | title = Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Antagonists Promote the Expansion of Human Hematopoietic Stem Cells | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5997 | pages = 1345–8 |date=September 2010 | pmid = 20688981 | doi = 10.1126/science.1191536 | pmc = 3033342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7683034"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Craig W, Kay R, Cutler RL, Lansdorp PM | title = Expression of Thy-1 on human hematopoietic progenitor cells | journal = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4512">'''Cluster criticism''' is a method of [[rhetorical criticism]] in which a critic examines the structural relations and associative meanings between certain main ideas, concepts, or subjects present in a text. 

==Method== 
There are three steps in performing a cluster criticism: identifying key terms, creating clusters from associated elements, and examining and comparing clusters.&lt;ref name="isbn1-57766-318-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Foss, Sonja K. |title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice |publisher=Waveland Pr Inc |location= |year=1996 |chapter=Cluster Criticism |pages=367–70 |isbn=1-57766-318-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Identify Key Terms===
First, key terms are identified.  These are generally the ideas, subjects, topics, or arguments that work discusses.  They usually (but not always) occur more often than any other element in the work; they can also be identified in a work's introduction.  
===Create Clusters from Associated Elements===
Next, the critic identifies surrounding elements in the text that refer to or are associated with each of the key terms.  Each collection of associated elements which refer to the same key term is called a cluster.  
===Examine and Compare Clusters===
In the final step of the criticism, the critic examines how each specific cluster represents its referring key term.  This process typically includes directly contrasting one cluster with another.  By doing this, a critic can determine how a text privileges one key term over others.

This stage of cluster criticism can incorporate other methods in [[rhetorical criticism]].  For example, if different types of [[metaphor]]s are found in different clusters, a critic can perform multiple [[metaphoric criticism]]s in order to show how each key term characterizes a particular position or entity.

==Example==
The following is an excerpt from a speech titled [[s:Americanism (Harding)|"Americanism"]] given by [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1920 regarding aid to European nations devastated by World War I.  Terms '''bolded''' are those a critic might associate with the key term "Old World stabilization" and terms &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; are those a critic might associate with the key term "stabilize America."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's time to '''idealize''', but it's very &lt;u&gt;practical&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;make sure&lt;/u&gt; our own &lt;u&gt;house&lt;/u&gt; is in perfect &lt;u&gt;order&lt;/u&gt; before we '''attempt''' the '''miracle''' of '''Old World stabilization'''. Call it the &lt;u&gt;selfishness of nationality&lt;/u&gt; if you will. I think it's an &lt;u&gt;inspiration&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;patriotic devotion&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;safeguard&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;stabilize America&lt;/u&gt; first, to &lt;u&gt;prosper&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;think&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;exalt&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;live&lt;/u&gt; for and &lt;u&gt;revere&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;. Let the '''internationalist''' '''dream''' and the '''Bolshevist''' '''destroy'''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this example, the critic would examine the cluster of words and phrases around the key term "Old world stabilization" in order to find certain patterns.  Terms like idealize, miracle, dream, and attempt depict reconstruction through aid as an unproven strategy; internationalist and Bolshevist characterize supporters of aid as foreign and Communist; and the ending word 'destroy' implies a disastrous consequence for the proposal.  In all, a critic can assume that these clusters work together to present aid for European reconstruction as an irresponsible and un-American plan. 

In stark contrast, the terms in the cluster around "stabilize America" construct a rejection of the proposal as the only responsible and American choice.  Terms like make sure, think, practical, order, safeguard, live, and prosper construct a refusal of European reconstruction as safe and sensible.  The words inspiration, exalt, and revere function with the phrases "patriotic devotion" and "selfishness of nationality" to characterize a refusal of aid as a positive, patriotic act.  Finally, the repeated phrase "America first" dichotomizes the issue into a choice between placing America or Europe first, with no middle ground.

The conclusion of this cluster criticism would therefore be that Harding advances his argument by constructing European aid as an irresponsible and un-American policy and a rejection of aid as a responsible, pro-American policy as well as framing the issue as an irreconcilable choice between the interests of America and Europe.

'''Cognitive science of religion''' is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[neurotheology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[archaeology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.

==History==
Although religion has been the subject of serious scientific study since at least the late nineteenth century, the study of religion as a cognitive phenomenon is relatively recent. While it often relies upon earlier research within [[anthropology of religion]]&lt;ref&gt;Geertz C. (1966) "Religion as cultural system" In: Banton, M. (ed) ''Anthropological approaches to the study of religion'' London: Tavistock p 1-46&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociology of religion]], cognitive science of religion considers the results of that work within the context of evolutionary and cognitive theories. As such, cognitive science of religion was only made possible by the [[cognitive revolution]] of the 1950s and the development, starting in the 1970s, of [[sociobiology]] and other approaches explaining human behaviour in evolutionary terms, especially [[evolutionary psychology]].

While [[Dan Sperber]] foreshadowed cognitive science of religion in his 1975 book ''Rethinking Symbolism'', the earliest research to fall within the scope of the discipline was published during the 1980s. Among this work, [[Stewart E. Guthrie]]'s [https://www.academia.edu/209728/A_Cognitive_Theory_of_Religion "A cognitive theory of religion"]&lt;ref&gt;''Current Anthropology'' 21 (2) 1980, pp. 181-203.&lt;/ref&gt; was significant for examining the significance of anthropomorphism within religion, work that ultimately led to the development of the concept of the [[hyperactive agency detection device]] – a key concept within cognitive science of religion.

The real beginning of cognitive science of religion can be dated to the 1990s, however. During that decade a large number of highly influential books and articles were published which helped to lay the foundations of cognitive science of religion. These included ''Rethinking Religion: Connecting Cognition and Culture'' and ''Bringing Ritual to Mind: Psychological Foundations of Cultural Forms'' by [[E. Thomas Lawson]] and [[Robert McCauley]], ''Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' by [[Pascal Boyer]], ''Inside the Cult'' and ''Arguments and Icons''&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;[[Harvey Whitehouse]], and Guthrie's book-length development of his earlier theories in ''Faces in the Clouds''. In the 1990s, these and other researchers, who had been working independently in a variety of different disciplines, discovered each other's work and found valuable parallels between their approaches, with the result that something of a self-aware research tradition began to coalesce. By 2000, the field was well-enough defined for [[Justin L. Barrett]] to coin the term 'cognitive science of religion' in his article [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01419-9 "Exploring the natural foundations of religion"].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin|title=Exploring the natural foundations of religion|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1 January 2000|volume=4|pages=29–34|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01419-9}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, cognitive science of religion has grown,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} similarly to other approaches that apply evolutionary thinking to sociological phenomena. Each year more researchers become involved in the field,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} with theoretical and empirical developments proceeding at a very rapid pace. The field remains somewhat loosely defined, bringing together as it does researchers who come from a variety of different traditions. Much of the cohesion in the field comes not from shared detailed theoretical commitments but from a general willingness to view religion in cognitive and evolutionary terms as well as from the willingness to engage with the work of the others developing this field. A vital role in bringing together researchers is played by the [[International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion]], formed in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Theoretical basis==
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Despite a lack of agreement concerning the theoretical basis for work in cognitive science of religion, it is possible to outline some tendencies. Most significant of these is reliance upon the theories developed within [[evolutionary psychology]]. That particular approach to evolutionary explanations of human behaviour is particularly suitable to the cognitive byproduct explanation of religion that is most popular among cognitive scientists of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyysiäinen|first1=Ilkka and Marc Hauser|title=The origins of religion : evolved adaptation or by-product?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=March 2010|volume=14|issue=3|pages=104–09|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because of the focus on byproduct and ancestral trait explanations within evolutionary psychology. A particularly significant concept associated with this approach is [[modularity of mind]], used as it is to underpin accounts of the mental mechanisms seen to be responsible for religious beliefs. Important examples of work that falls under this rubric are provided by research carried out by [[Pascal Boyer]] and [[Justin L. Barrett]].

These theoretical commitments are not shared by all cognitive scientists of religion, however. Ongoing debates regarding the comparative advantages of different evolutionary explanations for human behaviour&lt;ref&gt;See Laland K. and Brown D. (2002) ''Sense and Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior'' Oxford: Oxford University Press for overview.&lt;/ref&gt; find a reflection within cognitive science of religion with [[dual inheritance theory]] recently gaining adherents among researchers in the field, including [[Armin Geertz]] and [[Ara Norenzayan]]. The perceived advantage of this theoretical framework is its ability to deal with more complex interactions between cognitive and cultural phenomena, but it comes at the cost of experimental design having to take into consideration a richer range of possibilities.

==Main concepts==

===Cognitive byproduct===
The view that religious beliefs and practices should be understood as nonfunctional but as produced by human cognitive mechanisms that are functional outside of the context of religion. Examples of this are the hyperactive [[agent detection]] device and the minimally counterintuitive concepts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icea.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/CAM/dMinimalcounterintuitiveness.pdf Minimal counterintuitiveness]&lt;/ref&gt; or the process of initiation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/663726/Oliver_Kress_-_A_new_approach_to_cognitive_development_ontogenesis_and_the_process_of_initiation Kress, Oliver (1993). "A new approach to cognitive development: ontogenesis and the process of initiation". Evolution and Cognition 2(4): 319-332.]&lt;/ref&gt; explaining [[buddhism]] and [[taoism]]. The cognitive byproduct explanation of religion is an application of the concept of [[spandrel (biology)]] and of the concept of  [[exaptation]] explored by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] among others.

===Minimally counterintuitive concepts===
Concepts that mostly fit human preconceptions but break with them in one or two striking ways. These concepts are both easy to remember (thanks to the counterintuitive elements) and easy to use (thanks to largely agreeing with what people expect). Examples include talking trees and noncorporeal agents. [[Pascal Boyer]] argues that many religious entities fit into this category.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''The Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' University of California Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Upal&lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2010). "An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect", ''Journal of Cognitive Systems Research'', 11(2), 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; labelled the fact that minimally counterintuitive ideas are better remembered than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive ideas as [[the minimal counterintuitiveness effect]] or the MCI-effect.

===Hyperactive agency detection device===
[[Cognitive scientist]] [[Justin L. Barrett]] postulates that this mental mechanism, whose function is to identify the activity of agents, may contribute to belief in the presence of the supernatural. Given the relative costs of failing to spot an agent, the mechanism is said to be hyperactive, producing a large number of [[Type I and type II errors|false positive errors]]. [[Stewart E. Guthrie (scientist)|Stewart E. Guthrie]] and others have claimed these errors can explain the appearance of supernatural concepts.

===Pro-social adaptation===
According to the prosocial adaptation account of religion, religious beliefs and practices should be understood as having the function of eliciting adaptive prosocial behaviour and avoiding the [[free rider problem]]. Within the cognitive science of religion this approach is primarily pursued by [[Richard Sosis]]. [[David Sloan Wilson]] is another major proponent of this approach and interprets religion as a group-level adaptation, but his work is generally seen as falling outside the cognitive science of religion.

===Costly signaling===
Practices that, due to their inherent cost, can be relied upon to provide an [[Signalling theory#Human honest signals|honest signal]] regarding the intentions of the agent. [[Richard Sosis]] has suggested that religious practices can be explained as costly signals of the willingness to cooperate. A similar line of argument has been pursued by [[Lyle Steadman]] and [[Craig Palmer]]. Alternatively, D. Jason Slone has argued that religiosity may be a costly signal used as a [[mating strategy]] in so far as religiosity serves as a proxy for "family values."

===Dual inheritance===
In the context of cognitive science of religion, dual inheritance theory can be understood as attempting to combine the cognitive byproduct and prosocial adaptation accounts using the theoretical approach developed by [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] and [[Peter Richerson]], among others. The basic view is that while belief in supernatural entities is a cognitive byproduct, cultural traditions have recruited such beliefs to motivate prosocial behaviour. A sophisticated statement of this approach can be found in [[Scott Atran]] and [[Joseph Henrich]] (2010) [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/BIOT_a_00018 "The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions"] ''Biological Theory'' 5.1.

'''Computer-supported collaboration''' ('''CSC''') research focuses on technology that affects groups, organizations, communities and societies, e.g., [[voice mail]] and [[text chat]]. It grew from '''cooperative work''' study of supporting people's work activities and working relationships. As net technology increasingly supported a wide range of recreational and social activities, consumer markets expanded the user base, enabling more and more people to connect online to create what researchers have called a [[CSCW|computer supported cooperative work]], which includes "all contexts in which technology is used to mediate human activities such as communication, coordination, cooperation, competition, entertainment, games, art, and music" (from CSCW 2004).

==Scope of the field==

===Focused on output===
The subfield [[computer-mediated communication]] deals specifically with how humans use "computers" (or [[digital media]]) to form, support and maintain relationships with others (social uses), regulate information flow (instructional uses), and make decisions (including major financial and political ones). It does not focus on common work products or other "[[collaboration]]" but rather on "meeting" itself, and on [[Trust (sociology)|trust]]. By contrast, CSC is focused on the output from, rather than the character or emotional consequences of, meetings or relationships, reflecting the difference between "communication" and "collaboration".

===Focused on contracts and rendezvous===
Unlike communication research, which focuses on trust, or [[computer science]], which focuses on [[truth]] and [[logic]], CSC focuses on [[cooperation]] and [[collaboration]] and [[decision making]] theory, which are more concerned with [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] and [[contract]]. For instance, [[auction]]s and [[market system]]s, which rely on [[bid and ask]] relationships, are studied as part of CSC but not usually as part of communication.

The term CSC emerged in the 1990s to replace the following terms:
* '''workgroup computing''', which emphasizes technology over the work being supported and seems to restrict inquiry to small organizational units.
* '''[[groupware]]''', which became a commercial [[buzzword]] and was used to describe popular commercial products such as Lotus Notes. Check [http://www.enolagaia.com/UMUArchive/CSCWLitGuide.html#CoreLit here] for a comprehensive literature review.
* '''computer supported cooperative work''', which is the name of a conference and which seems only to address research into experimental systems and the nature of workplaces and organizations doing "work", as opposed, say, to play or war.

===Collaboration is not a software===
Two different types of software are sometimes differentiated:
* [[social software]], which produces social ties as its primary output, e.g., a [[social network service]]
* [[collaborative software]], which produces a collaborative deliverable, e.g., an online collaborative encyclopedia like [[Wikipedia]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Base technologies such as [[netnews]], [[email]], [[Online chat|chat]] and [[wiki]]s could be described as "social", "collaborative" or both or neither. Those who say "social" seem to focus on so-called "[[virtual community]]" while those who say "collaborative" seem to be more concerned with [[content management]] and the actual output. While software may be designed to achieve closer social ties or specific deliverables, it is hard to support collaboration without also enabling relationships to form, and hard to support a social interaction without some kind of shared co-authored works. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===May include games===
Accordingly, the differentiation between social and collaborative software may also be stated as that between "play" and "work". Some theorists hold that a play ethic should apply, and that work must become more game-like or play-like in order to make using computers a more comfortable experience.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The study of [[MUD]]s and [[MMRPG]]s in the 1980s and 1990s led many to this conclusion, which is now not controversial. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

True multi-player [[computer game]]s can be considered a simple form of collaboration, but only a few theorists include this as part of CSC.

=== Not just about "computing" ===
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2007}}

The relatively new areas of evolutionary computing, massively parallel algorithms, and even "artificial life" explore the solution of problems by the evolving interaction of large numbers of small actors, or agents, or decision-makers who interact in a largely unconstrained fashion. The "side effect" of the interaction may be a solution of interest, such as a new sorting algorithm; or there may be a permanent residual of the interaction, such as the setting of weights in a neural network that has now been "tuned" or "trained" to repeatedly solve a specific problem, such as making a decision about granting credit to a person, or distinguishing a diseased plant from a healthy one. Connectionism is a study of systems in which the learning is stored in the linkages, or connections, not in what is normally thought of as content.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

This larger definition of "computing", in which not just the data, or the metadata, or the context of the data, but the computer itself is being "processed", makes the term "social computing" have a whole different meaning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Requires protocols===
Communication essential to the collaboration, or disruptive of it, is studied in CSC proper.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} It is somehow hard to find or draw a line between a well-defined process and general human communications.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Reflecting desired [[organization protocol]]s and [[business process]]es and [[governance]] norms directly, so that regulated communication (the collaboration) can be told apart from free-form interactions, is important to collaboration research, if only to know where to stop the study of work and start the study of people. ''The subfield CMC or [[computer-mediated communication]] deals with human relationships.''{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Basic tasks==
Tasks undertaken in this field resemble those of any social science, but with a special focus on [[systems integration]] and [[Group (sociology)|groups]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.acm.org/cscw2004/prog_tutorials.html CSCW 2004 tutorials] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103151319/http://www1.acm.org/cscw2004/prog_tutorials.html |date=November 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less ambitiously, specific CSC fields are often studied under their own names with no reference to the more general field of study, focusing instead on the technology with only minimal attention to the collaboration implied, e.g. [[video game]]s, [[videoconference]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Since some specialized devices exist for games or conferences that do not include all of the usual [[boot image]] capabilities of a true "computer", studying these separately may be justified. There is also separate study of [[e-learning]], [[e-government]], [[e-democracy]] and [[telemedicine]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The subfield [[telework]] also often stands alone.

==History==

===Early research===
The development of this field reaches back to the late 1960s and the visionary assertions of [[Ted Nelson]], [[Douglas Engelbart]], [[Alan Kay]], [[Glenn Gould]], [[Nicholas Negroponte]] and others who saw a potential for [[digital media]] to ultimately redefine how we work. A very early thinker, [[Vannevar Bush]], even suggested in 1945 ''[[As We May Think]].''

====Numbers====
The inventor of the computer "mouse", [[Douglas Engelbart]], studied [[collaborative software]] (especially [[revision control]] in [[computer-aided software engineering]] and the way a [[graphic user interface]] could enable interpersonal communication) in the 1960s. [[Alan Kay]] worked on [[Smalltalk]], which embodied these principles, in the 1970s, and by the 1980s it was well regarded and considered to represent the future of user interfaces.

However, at this time, collaboration capabilities were limited. As few computers had even [[local area network]]s, and processors were slow and expensive, the idea of using them simply to accelerate and "augment" human communication was eccentric in many situations. Computers processed numbers, not text, and the collaboration was in general devoted only to better and more accurate handling of numbers.

====Text====
This began to change in the 1980s with the rise of [[personal computer]]s, [[modem]]s and more general use of the [[Internet]] for non-academic purposes. People were clearly collaborating online with all sorts of motives, but using a small suite of tools ([[LISTSERV]], [[netnews]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[MUD]]) to support all of those motives. Research at this time focused on textual communication, as there was little or no exchange of audio and video representations. Some researchers, such as [[Brenda Laurel]], emphasized how similar online [[dialogue]] was to a [[Play (theatre)|play]], and applied [[Aristotle]]'s model of [[drama]] to their analysis of computers for collaboration.

Another major focus was [[hypertext]]&amp;mdash;in its pre-[[HTML]], pre-[[WWW]] form, focused more on links and [[semantic web]] applications than on graphics. Such systems as [[Superbook]], [[NoteCards]], [[Knowledge Management System|KMS]] and the much simpler [[HyperTies]] and [[HyperCard]] were early examples of [[collaborative software]] used for [[e-learning]].

====Audio====
In the 1990s, the rise of [[broadband]] networks and the [[dotcom boom]] presented the internet as mass media to a whole generation. By the late 1990s, [[VoIP]] and [[net phone]]s and chat had emerged. For the first time, people used computers ''primarily'' as communications, not "computing" devices. This, however, had long been anticipated, predicted, and studied by experts in the field.

Video collaboration is not usually studied. Online videoconferencing and [[webcam]]s have been studied in small scale use for decades but since people simply do not have built-in facilities to create video together directly, they are properly a communication, not collaboration, concern.

===Pioneers===
Other pioneers in the field included [[Ted Nelson]], [[Austin Henderson]], [[Kjeld Schmidt]], [[Lucy Suchman]], [[Sara Bly]], [[Randy Farmer]], and many "[[economics|economist]]s, [[social psychology|social psychologist]]s, [[anthropology|anthropologist]]s, [[organization theory|organizational theorist]]s, [[education|educator]]s, and anyone else who can shed light on group activity." - Grudin.

===Politics and business===
In this century, the focus has shifted to [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[management science]] and other [[business]] disciplines. This reflects the use of the net in politics and business and even other high-stakes collaboration situations, such as war.

===War===
Though it is not studied at the ACM conferences, military use of [[collaborative software]] has been a very major impetus of work on [[map]]s and [[data fusion]], used in [[military intelligence]]. A number of conferences and journals are concerned primarily with the military use of digital media and the security implications thereof.

==Current research==
Current research in computer-supported collaboration includes:

===Speech recognition===
{{see also|Speech recognition}}
Early researchers, such as [[Bill Buxton]], had focused on non-voice gestures (like [[humming]] or [[whistling]]) as a way to communicate with the machine while not interfering too directly with speech directed at a person. Some researchers believed [[voice command device|voice as command]] interfaces were bad for this reason, because they encouraged speaking as if to a "slave".

===Link semantics===

HTML supports simple link types with the REL tag and REV tag. Some standards for using these on the [[WWW]] were proposed, most notably in 1994, by people very familiar with earlier work in [[SGML]]. However, no such scheme has ever been adopted by a large number of web users, and the "[[semantic web]]" remains unrealized. Attempts such as [[crit.org]] have sometimes collapsed totally.

===Identity and privacy===
Who am I, online? Can an account be assumed to be the same as a person's real-life identity? Should I have rights to continue any relationship I start through a service, even if I'm not using it any longer? Who owns information about the user? What about others (not the user) who are affected by information revealed or learned by me?

[[Digital identity|Online identity]] and [[privacy]] concerns, especially [[identity theft]], have grown to dominate the CSCW agenda in more recent years. The separate [[Computers, Freedom and Privacy]] conferences deal with larger social questions, but basic concerns that apply to systems and work process design tend still to be discussed as part of CSC research.

===Online decision making===
Where decisions are made based exclusively or mostly on information received or exchanged online, how do people rendezvous to signal their trust in it, and willingness to make major decisions on it?

Team [[consensus decision making]] in [[software engineering]], and the role of [[revision control]], [[Reversion (software development)|revert]], [[reputation]] and other functions, has always been a major focus of CSC: There is no software without someone writing it. Presumably, those who do write it must understand something about collaboration in their own team. This design and code, however, is only one form of collaborative content.

===Collaborative content===
What are the most efficient and effective ways to share information? Can creative networks form through online meeting/work systems? Can people have [[equal power relationship]]s in building content?

By the late 1990s, with the rise of [[wiki]]s (a simple repository and [[data dictionary]] that was easy for the public to use), the way [[consensus]] applied to joint editing, meeting agendas and so on had become a major concern. Different wikis adopted different social and pseudopolitical structures to combat the problems caused by conflicting points of view and differing opinions on content.]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===[[Workflow]]===
How can work be made simpler, less prone to error, easier to learn? What role do diagrams and notations play in improving work output? What words do workers come to work already understanding, what do they misunderstand, and how can we get them using the same words to mean the same thing?

Study of [[content management]], [[enterprise taxonomy]] and the other core [[instructional capital]] of the [[learning organization]] has become increasingly important due to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards and the use of [[continuous improvement]] methods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}
Natural language and application commands tend to converge over time, becoming reflexive user interfaces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Telework and human capital management===
Where are the workers? Do we care? How do we coordinate them? How do we hire them, fire them, help them find the right thing to do next?

The role of [[social network analysis]] and [[outsourcing]] services like e-lance, especially when combined in services like [[LinkedIn]], is of particular concern in [[human capital]] management&amp;mdash;again, especially in the software industry, where it is becoming more and more normal to run 24x7 globally distributed shops.

'''Dirty Sanchez''' is a purported [[Human sexual activity|sex act]] where [[feces]] are purposely smeared onto a partner's upper lip. Sex-advice columnist [[Dan Savage]] says the act is completely fictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do the Santorum|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14422|last=Savage|first=Dan|date=2003-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Bouldrey]] in ''Dirty Words: A Literary Encyclopedia of Sex'' says the act is an urban legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirty Words: A Literary Encyclopedia of Sex|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2008|isbn=1-59691-474-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English]]'' says, "This appears to have been contrived with the intention to provoke shock rather than actually as a practice, although, no doubt, some have or will experiment."&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;Partridge, Eric; Dalzell, Tom; Victor, Terry (2006).

== Etymology ==
Columnist [[Gustavo Arellano]] of ''[[¡Ask a Mexican!]]'' contends the term evokes the stereotypical mustache of a Mexican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ask a Mexican|first=Gustavo|last=Arellano|pages=67|year=2007|isbn=1-4165-4002-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term for the sex act entered British gay [[Cant (language)|cant]] [[Polari]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang|last=Baker|first=Paul|year=2004|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|pages=109|isbn=0-8264-7343-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
American heavy metal band [[Steel Panther]] mentioned Dirty Sanchez in their song titled "The Shocker" from their album ''[[Feel the Steel]]'' (2009). Another band, [[Sleazy RoXxX]], recorded a song called "Dirty Sanchez" as the opener for their album ''[[Topless Suicide]]''' (2016).{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Proper Condom Use]]" (2001), the Filthy Sanchez is noted as a sexual act, among several other allusive terms for sexual acts. "Hot Karl" was also mentioned.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

A 2004 advertisement for [[Unilever]]'s Seedy Sanchez [[Pot Noodle]] featured a [[Mariachi]] band singing a song filled with [[double entendre]]s about their noodles and the sex act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuxbnWuP6wM|title=Pot Noodle Ad – Seedy   Also seen in scary movie 4  Sanchez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pot Noodle continues innuendo in new TV ad|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/Campaign/News/204400/Pot-Noodle-continues-innuendo-new-TV-ad/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630110053/http://www.brandrepublic.com/Campaign/News/204400/Pot-Noodle-continues-innuendo-new-TV-ad/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-06-30|publisher=Brand Republic|date=2004-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the movie ''[[Dodgeball:A True Underdog Story]]'' (2004), after their victory over the girl scout troop, they{{who|date=November 2018}} meet White Goodman and his team in a bar called "The Dirty Sanchez".  The side of the building shows a woman with a moustache holding a beer.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

It was mentioned in the film ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' (2005) along with [[rusty trombone]] by Mooj after learning Andy is a virgin.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In 2006, [[Dustin Diamond]] directed and released his own sex tape ''Screeched – Saved by the smell'' (2006), which was marketed as depicting Diamond performing the sex act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2006-09-27/gossip/18343532_1_tape-alice-cooper-glam|title=Porn Star's Name May Ring A 'Bell'|publisher=New York Daily News|date=2006-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2006/10/screech-sex-tape-guest-stars-revealed/|title=Screech Sex Tape "Guest Stars" Revealed|publisher=The Hollywood Gossip|date=2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's marketer [[David Hans Schmidt]] appeared on the ''[[Howard Stern Show]]'' in October 2006, and Stern confirmed the act was performed in the film.&lt;ref name="Stern2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1160539200|title=The Howard Stern Show for October 11, 2006|date=2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has ruled that the term is actionably indecent. [[WXYT-FM|WKRK-FM]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], has twice been fined for using the term on air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2003/FCC-03-71A1.html|title=NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY FOR FORFEITURE

Moorad Sports Law Journal | access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television show ''[[Family Guy]]'' referenced it in an episode but made up the variation 'muddy Ramirez' due to network censoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Morgan Jeffery

In DC Comics' ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #22, the term was replaced with a made-up term, 'sloppy aardvark', in order to avoid editorial objections to the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/12/22/when-a-dirty-sanchez-gets-replaced-by-a-sloppy-aardvark/|title=When Harley Quinn Replaces A Dirty Sanchez With A Sloppy Aardvark

A '''double inverted pendulum''' is the combination of the [[inverted pendulum]] and the [[double pendulum]]. The double inverted pendulum is unstable, meaning that it will fall down unless it is controlled in some way. The two main methods of controlling a double inverted pendulum are moving the base, as with the inverted pendulum, or by applying a torque at the pivot point between the two pendulums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''EcocyclET''' is a system that removes pollution through [[evapotranspiration]], using plants' requirements for water and nutrients to filter wastewater.

==History==
First known as the Waste Water Garden, the EcocyclET is a bio-engineered system whose technologies were developed and licensed by David Del Porto of the [[Ecological engineering|Ecological Engineering]] Group in Concord, MA, from a concept originally conceived and tested by [[University of Toronto]] [[environmental engineering]] professor [[Alfred Bernhart]] (''"Evapotranspiration Nutrient uptake Soil infiltration of Effluent water”'' A.P. Bernhart).

In 2004, Centre for Sustainable Watersheds completed the installation of Canada’s first EcocyclET. This prototype was initiated to demonstrate a [[Sustainable design|sustainable technology]] for rural wastewater management, ensuring zero discharge to the ground.

==Method==
Most plants use photosynthesis and [[evapotranspiration]] (ET). EcocyclET is a closed-loop operation that employs lined beds of sand, crushed stone and gravels and specified plantings. Effluent from [[septic tank]]s, [[greywater]], [[composting toilet]]s leachate or urine from separating toilets, is recirculated through the bed. There, naturally occurring [[Microorganism|micro-organisms]] convert the chemical constituents of the wastewater into nutrients for plants growth. The impervious bed liner ensures that no effluent can enter the subsurface environment or nearby receiving waters. All the wastewater will be ultimately transpirated as un-transpirated effluent is drained back into a recycle tank, stored and pumped back to the bed when the conditions for [[evapotranspiration]] are optimal.
The system can also by used as a greywater reuse planter to be installed where soils are too poor to be considered for a soil absorption system.

'''El Castillo''' ({{IPA-es|el kas'tiʎo}}, Spanish for "the castle"), also known as the '''Temple of Kukulcan''' (or sometimes '''Kukulkan'''), is a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Mesoamerican step-pyramid]] that dominates the center of the [[Chichen Itza]] archaeological site in the Mexican [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]. The building is more formally designated by archaeologists as Chichen Itza '''Structure 5B18'''.

Built by the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] sometime between the 9th and 12th centuries CE, El Castillo served as a temple to the god [[Kukulkan]], the Yucatec Maya [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|Feathered Serpent deity]] closely related to the god [[Quetzalcoatl]] known to the [[Aztec]]s and other central Mexican cultures of the [[Postclassic period]].

The pyramid consists of a series of square terraces with stairways up each of the four sides to the temple on top. Sculptures of plumed serpents run down the sides of the northern balustrade. Around the [[spring equinox|spring]] and [[autumn equinox]]es, the late afternoon sun strikes off the northwest corner of the pyramid and casts a series of triangular shadows against the northwest balustrade, creating the illusion of a feathered serpent "crawling" down the pyramid. The event has been very popular and is witnessed by thousands of visitors at the spring equinox, but it is questionable whether it is a result of a purposeful design, because the light-and-shadow effect can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=XXV |issue=149 |pages=26-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the pyramid's four sides has 91 steps which, when added together and including the temple platform on top as the final "step", produces a total of 365 steps (which is equal to the number of days of the ''[[Haab']]'' year).&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath 1989: 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is {{convert|24|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, plus an additional {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} for the temple. The square base measures {{convert|55.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} across.

==Construction==
The construction of El Castillo, like other Mesoamerican pyramids, likely reflected the common practice of executing several phases of construction. The last construction probably took place between 900-1000 CE, while the substructure may have been constructed between 600-800 AD. Based on archaeological research, construction of El Castillo was based on the concept of ''[[axis mundi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the space remained sacred regardless of the structure positioned on the location. When a temple or pyramid structure was renewed, the former construction was ritually destroyed, which involved resolving the space of spiritual forces to preserve its sacredness.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that this construction dates to the [[eleventh century]] CE. After all of the work was completed, an entryway was cut into the balustrade of the northeastern exterior staircase to provide access to tourists. The older, inner pyramid is referred to as the "substructure".

In 1566, the pyramid was described by Friar [[Diego de Landa]] in the manuscript known as Yucatán at the Time of the Spanish Encounter ([[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]). Almost three centuries later, [[John Lloyd Stephens]] described with even more detail the architecture of the pyramid in his book Incidents of Travel in Yucatán (Incidentes del viaje Yucatán), published in 1843. At that time, the archaeological site of [[Chichén Itzá]] was located on an estate, also called [[Chichén Itzá]], owned by Juan Sosa. [[Frederick Catherwood]] illustrated the book with lithographs depicting the pyramid covered in abundant vegetation on all sides. There are some photographs taken in the beginning of the 20th century that also show the pyramid partially covered by said vegetation.

In 1924, the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]] in Washington, D.C. requested permission from the Mexican government to carry out explorations and restoration efforts in and around the area of [[Chichen Itza]]. In 1927, with the assistance of Mexican archaeologists, they started the task. In April 1931, looking to confirm the hypothesis that the structure of the pyramid of Kukulkan was built on top of a much older pyramid, the work of excavation and exploration began in spite of generalized beliefs contrary to that hypothesis. On June 7, 1932, a box with coral, obsidian, and turquoise encrusted objects was found alongside human remains, which are exhibited in the [[National Anthropology Museum]] in Mexico City.

El Castillo is located above a cavity filled with water, labeled a sinkhole or [[cenote]]. Recent archaeological investigations suggest that an earlier construction phase is located closer to the south-east cenote, rather than being centered.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; This specific proximity to the cenote suggests that the Maya may have been aware of the cenote’s existence and purposefully constructed there to facilitate their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After extensive work, in April 1935, a [[Chac Mool]] statue, with its nails, teeth, and eyes inlaid with [[mother of pearl]] was found inside the pyramid. The room where the discovery was made was nicknamed the "Hall of offerings" or "North Chamber". After more than a year of excavation, in August 1936, a second room was found, only meters away from the first. Inside this room, dubbed the "Chamber of Sacrifices", archaeologists found two parallel rows of human bone set into the back wall, as well as a red [[jaguar]] statue. Both deposits of human remains were found oriented north-northeast. Researchers concluded that there must be an inner pyramid approximately {{convert|33|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, shaped similarly to the outer pyramid, with nine steps and a height of {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} up to the base of the temple where the Chac Mool and the jaguar were found.

The discovery of what appears to be a throne (referred to as the "Red Jaguar") in the throne room was previously assumed to have been decorated with flint and green stone discs, but recent research has determined the jaguar to be composed of highly symbolic and valued materials for ritualistic significance. The use of x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) was used to determine that the sculpture is painted red with a pigment that includes [[cinnabar]], or mercury sulfide (HgS)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Cinnabar was not in accessible proximity to Chichén Itzá, so the transportation of this pigment through long-distance trade placed a high value of this product.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the color red appears to be significant to Maya symbolism, and it is associated with creating life as well as death and sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that objects in Maya culture were imbued with vital essence, so the choice of painting the jaguar red may be a reflection of these beliefs, deeming the jaguar as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; The high-status associated with the cinnabar pigment and its red tone suggest that the jaguar was linked to ritual importance of closing a temple for renewal.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The four fangs of the Red Jaguar have been identified as gastropod mollusk shells (''[[Lobatus costatus]]'') using a digital microscope  and comparative analysis from [[malacology]] experts from the National Institute of Anthropology and History, another valued resource that may have been traded into Chichén Itzá.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; The green stones were also analyzed and determined to be a form of jadeite.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; Jadeite was valuable economically and socially, and the acquisition and application of the material is indicative of the access Chichén Itzá had along its trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological studies indicate that the Red Jaguar is similar to other depictions of thrones found in murals (Temple of [[Chacmool]]), thus whomever was seated on this throne could have been accessing the point of ''axis mundi'', which is essential to the elements and relationship to the cosmological system.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico.

==Alignment==


The location of the pyramid is aligned at the intersection between four cenotes: the Sacred Cenote, Xtoloc, Kanjuyum, and Holtún. This alignment supports the position of El Castillo as an ''axis mundi''.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The western and eastern sides of the temple are angled to the zenith sunset and nadir sunrise, which may correspond with other calendar events such as start of the traditional planting and harvesting seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Wren, L., Kristan-Graham, C., Nygard, T., &amp; Spencer, K. R. (2018). Landscapes of the Itza : Archaeology and art history at Chichen Itza and neighboring sites. Gainesville: University Press of Florida.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the approximate correspondence with the Sun's positions on its zenith and nadir passages is likely coincidental, because very few Mesoamerican orientations match these events and even for such cases a different explanation is much more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Zenith and nadir passages of the Sun in Mesoamerica |journal=Journal of Skyscape Archaeology |date=2018 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=108–117 |doi=10.1558/jsa.36092 |url=https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/JSA/article/viewFile/36092/32903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the sunrise and sunset dates recorded by solar orientations, which prevail in Mesoamerican architecture, tend to be separated by multiples of 13 and 20 days (i.e. of basic periods of the calendrical system), and given their clustering in certain seasons of the year, it has been argued that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars intended to facilitate a proper scheduling of agricultural and related ritual activities. In agreement with this pattern, detected both in the Maya Lowlands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sánchez Nava |first1=Pedro Francisco |last2=Šprajc |first2=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas |date=2015 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-607-484-727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere in Mesoamerica,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica |journal=Journal of Archaeological Research |date=2018 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=197–251 |doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; the north (and main) face of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá has an azimuth of 111.72°, corresponding to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, separated by 65 and 300 days (multiples of 13 and 20). Significantly, the same dates are recorded by El Castillo at Tulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Astronomía en la arquitectura de Chichén Itzá: una reevaluación |journal=Estudios de Cultura Maya |date=2013 |volume=XLI |pages=31-60 |doi=10.19130/iifl.ecm.2013.41.153 |url=https://revistas-filologicas.unam.mx/estudios-cultura-maya/index.php/ecm/article/view/153/154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
In recent years, the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH), which manages the archaeological site of Chichen Itza, has been closing monuments to public. While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers. Climbing El Castillo was stopped in 2006, after a woman fell to her death. At the same time INAH closed the public access to the interior throne room.&lt;ref&gt;Diario de Yucatan, "Fin a una exención para los mexicanos: Pagarán el día del equinoccio en la zona arqueológica," March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today "El Castillo" is one of the most recognized and widely visited pre-Columbian structures in present-day Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999: 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, researchers have discovered an enormous cenote (also known as a sinkhole) beneath the 1,000-year-old temple of Kulkulkan. The forming sinkhole beneath the temple is around {{convert|82|by|114|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} and up to {{convert|65|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. The water filling the cavern is thought to run from north to south.

Researchers also found a layer of limestone about {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} thick at the top of the cenote, on which the pyramid is sitting.

Recent archaeological investigations have utilized [[Electrical Resistivity Tomography]] (ERT) to examine the construction sequence of El Castillo.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve the site from potential damage, electrodes were placed non-traditionally as flat-based detectors around the quadrangle of the pyramid bodies of the pyramid. After each pyramidal body was tested, the data revealed two previous construction phases within El Castillo with a possible temple at the top of the second substructure. Determining the dates of when these constructions happened will provide time periods of when Chichen Itza may have been significantly occupied.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1548">'''''Esthesic''''' (UK ''aesthesic'') and '''''poietic''''' are terms used in [[semiotics]], the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]], to describe perceptive and [[productive]] levels, processes, and analyses of [[symbol]]ic forms.

Like [[emic and etic|'emic' and 'etic']], both words appear to be derived from a suffix, ''-poietic'' (from {{lang-el|ποιητικός}} "creative") meaning productive or formative and ''-esthesic'' (from αἴσθησις "sense") being receptive or perceptive, in relation to the [[neutral level]]. The neutral level is the "trace" left behind, the physical or material creation of esthesic and poietic processes.

Thus, "a symbolic form... is not some 'intermediary' in a process of 'communication' that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex ''process'' of creation (the poietic process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the esthesic process) that ''reconstructs'' a 'message.'"

The '''Gund Institute for Environment''' (founded 1992), formerly known as the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics and more commonly known as Gund Institute, is a research institute for transdisciplinary scholarship,&lt;ref name="transdisciplinary scholarship"&gt;[http://www.transdisciplinarity.ch/e/Transdisciplinarity/ td-net: Network for Transdisciplinary Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130031019/http://www.transdisciplinarity.ch/e/Transdisciplinarity/ |date=2012-01-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; based at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) and comprising diverse faculty, students, and collaborators worldwide. The Gund Institute offers graduate-level training where students are exposed to a wide range of expertise, perspectives, and techniques through course offerings, weekly discussions and seminars, and research mentoring. The Gund Institute offers a Certificate of Graduate Study in Ecological Economics, available both to UVM Graduate students and to anyone pursuing continuing education. In addition, it has a series of problem-solving workshops called "Ateliers" and nearly two hundred educational videos.&lt;ref name="Gund Youtube Channel"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/GundInstitute Gund Youtube Channel], https://www.youtube.com/user/GundInstitute.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
[[Image:UVM JohnsonHouse 20160521.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Johnson House (University of Vermont)|Johnson House]] at [[University of Vermont|UVM]], current home of the Gund Institute]]
The purpose of the Gund Institute is to conduct research at the interface of [[ecological]], [[social]], and [[economic]] systems, develop creative, practical solutions to local and global environmental challenges, and provide future leaders with the tools and understanding necessary to navigate the transition to a [[sustainable]] society.&lt;ref name="Official Website"&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/giee Our Community], www.uvm.edu/giee.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by Director [http://www.uvm.edu/rsenr/taylorricketts/ Taylor Ricketts], the Gund Institute is a community comprising Gund Fellows, Affiliates, Graduate Students, Visiting Scholars, and Staff. At UVM, faculty aren't appointed to the Institute itself but are affiliated with other departments all around the university.

== Projects ==
Three broad, interrelated themes provide centers of gravity for the Gund Institute's research, training, and outreach activities: Nature's Benefits, Ecological Economies, and Healthy Landscapes and Seascapes.&lt;ref name="Official Website" /&gt; Among their research projects are the [http://vtdigger.org/?s=gund+institute&amp;submit=Submit Vermont Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20120508062358/http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/peopleandconservation/natural-capital.xml Natural Capital Project].

== History ==
The Gund Institute was founded by [[Robert Costanza]] in 1991 as the Institute for Ecological Economics at the [[University of Maryland]]. In 2002, it was moved to the UVM's [[Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources]] and renamed the Gund Institute, after its major benefactors, the Gund family of Cleveland, Ohio. Robert Costanza continued as Director until 2010, when he left to help build a similar institute at Portland State University. [[Jon David Erickson|Jon Erickson]] was Managing Director from 2009 to 2012. Taylor Ricketts, former Director of the Conservation Science Program of the [[World Wildlife Fund]], was recruited as Director in 2011.

In the context of [[human evolution]], '''human vestigiality''' involves those [[phenotypic trait|traits]] (such as [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] or [[behavior]]s) occurring in [[human]]s that have lost all or most of their original [[function (biology)|function]] through [[evolution]]. Although structures called ''[[Vestigiality|vestigial]]'' often appear functionless, a vestigial structure may retain lesser functions or develop minor new ones. In some cases, structures once identified as vestigial simply had an unrecognized function.

The examples of human vestigiality are numerous, including the anatomical (such as the human [[Coccyx|tailbone]], [[Wisdom tooth|wisdom teeth]], and [[Plica semilunaris of conjunctiva|inside corner of the eye]]), the behavioral ([[goose bumps]] and [[palmar grasp reflex]]), and molecular ([[pseudogene]]s). Many human characteristics are also vestigial in other [[primate]]s and related animals.
{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== History ==
[[Charles Darwin]] listed a number of putative human vestigial features, which he termed rudimentary, in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' (1890). These included the [[Intrinsic muscles of external ear|muscles of the ear]], [[wisdom teeth]], the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], the [[tail bone]], [[body hair]], and the [[Nictitating membrane|semilunar fold]] in the corner of the [[human eye|eye]]. Darwin also commented on the sporadic nature of many vestigial features, particularly musculature. Making reference to the work of the anatomist [[William Turner (anatomist)|William Turner]], Darwin highlighted a number of sporadic muscles which he identified as vestigial remnants of the [[panniculus carnosus]], particularly the [[sternalis muscle]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C, ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'', London: John Murray, 1890, p.13.[https://archive.org/details/ajp4619.0001.001.umich.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner W, ''On the musculus sternalis'', Proc. Royal Soc. Edinburgh session 1866–1867, p.65.[https://archive.org/stream/proceedingso618661869roya#page/64/mode/2up/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, [[Robert Wiedersheim]] published [[Robert Wiedersheim#The Structure of Man|''The Structure of Man'']], a book on [[human anatomy]] and its relevance to man's evolutionary history. This book contained a list of 86 human organs that he considered vestigial, or as Wiedersheim himself explained: "Organs having become wholly or in part functionless, some appearing in the Embryo alone, others present during Life constantly or inconstantly. For the greater part Organs which may be rightly termed Vestigial."&lt;ref name="The Structure of Man"&gt;Wiedersheim, R. (1893) ''The Structure of Man: An Index to His Past History''. Second Edition. Translated by H. and M. Bernard. London: Macmillan and Co. 1895. [https://archive.org/details/structureofmanin00wiediala]&lt;/ref&gt; His list of supposedly vestigial organs included many of the examples on this page as well as others then mistakenly believed to be purely vestigial, such as the [[pineal gland]], the [[thymus gland]], and the [[pituitary gland]]. Some of these organs that had lost their obvious, original functions later turned out to have retained functions that had gone unrecognized before the discovery of hormones or many of the functions and tissues of the immune system.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;Muller, G. B. (2002) "Vestigial Organs and Structures." in Encyclopedia of Evolution. Mark Pagel, editor in chief, New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 1131–1133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Koerth-Baker | first=Maggie | title=Vestigial Organs Not So Useless After All | date=30 July 2009 | work=National Geographic | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090730-spleen-vestigial-organs.html | accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples included:
* the role of the pineal in the regulation of the [[circadian rhythm]] (neither the function nor even the existence of melatonin was yet known);
* discovery of the role of the [[thymus]] in the immune system lay many decades in the future; it remained a mystery organ until after the mid-20th century;
* the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary]] and [[hypothalamus]] with their many and varied hormones were far from understood, let alone the complexity of their interrelationships.

Historically, there was a trend not only to dismiss the [[vermiform appendix]] as being uselessly vestigial, but an anatomical hazard, a liability to [[Appendicitis|dangerous inflammation]]. As late as the mid-20th century, many reputable authorities conceded it no beneficial function.&lt;ref name="WellsSOF"&gt;Wells, H.g. Huxley, J. Wells, G. P. The Science of Life. Pub. Cassell 1931&lt;/ref&gt; This was a view supported, or perhaps inspired, by Darwin himself in the 1874 edition of his book [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]. The organ's patent liability to appendicitis and its poorly understood role left the appendix open to blame for a number of possibly unrelated conditions. For example, in 1916, a surgeon claimed that removal of the appendix had cured several cases of [[Trigeminal neuralgia|trifacial neuralgia]] and other nerve pain about the head and face, even though he stated that the evidence for appendicitis in those patients was inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, M. I.: Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 67, Issues 15-26, 1916. Page 1326&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of hormones and hormonal principles, notably by [[Endocrinology|Bayliss and Starling]], argued against these views, but in the early twentieth century, there remained a great deal of fundamental research to be done on the functions of large parts of the digestive tract. In 1916, an author found it necessary to argue against the idea that the colon had no important function and that "...the ultimate disappearance of the appendix is a coordinate action and not necessarily associated with such frequent inflammations as we are witnessing in the human..."&lt;ref&gt;W. Colin MacKenzie. A Contribution to the Biology of the Vermiform Appendix. Medical record, Volume 89 Page 342 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been a long history of doubt about such dismissive views. Around 1920, the prominent surgeon [[Kenelm Hutchinson Digby]] documented previous observations, going back more than thirty years, that suggested lymphatic tissues, such as the tonsils and appendix, may have substantial immunological functions.

[[File:Gray536.png|right|thumb|The human vermiform appendix on the vestigial caecum.]]
In modern humans, the [[vermiform appendix]] is a vestige of a redundant organ that in ancestral species had digestive functions, much as it still does in extant species in which intestinal flora hydrolyze [[cellulose]] and similar indigestible plant materials.&lt;ref name=Descent&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1871). ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''. John Murray: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Some herbivorous animals, such as rabbits, have a terminal vermiform appendix and [[cecum]] that apparently bear patches of tissue with immune functions and may also be important in maintaining the composition of [[intestinal flora]]. It does not however seem to have much digestive function, if any, and is not present in all herbivores, even those with large caeca.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stevens, C. Edward |author2=Hume, Ian | title = Comparative Physiology of the Vertebrate Digestive System | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-521-61714-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the accompanying pictures however, the human appendix typically is about comparable to that of the rabbit's in size, though the caecum is reduced to a single bulge where the ileum empties into the colon.&lt;ref name="WellsSOF" /&gt; Some carnivorous animals may have appendices too, but seldom have more than vestigial caeca.&lt;ref name="StPRCESD"&gt;Peter Robert Cheeke, Ellen S. Dierenfeld, Comparative Animal Nutrition and Metabolism. Publisher: CABI;  2010 {{ISBN|978-1-84593-631-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the possibility of vestigial organs developing new functions, some research suggests that the appendix may guard against the loss of symbiotic bacteria that aid in digestion, though that is unlikely to be a novel function, given the presence of vermiform appendices in many herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21153898/|title=Appendix may be useful after all – Health – Health care – More health news – NBC News|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Randal Bollinger |first1=R. |last2=Barbas |first2=Andrew S. |last3=Bush |first3=Errol L. |last4=Lin |first4=Shu S. |last5=Parker |first5=William |title=Biofilms in the large bowel suggest an apparent function of the human vermiform appendix |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=249 |issue=4 |pages=826–31 |year=2007 |pmid=17936308 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Intestinal bacterial populations entrenched in the appendix may support quick re-establishment of the flora of the large intestine after an illness, poisoning, or after an antibiotic treatment depletes or otherwise causes harmful changes to the bacterial population of the colon.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Q. Choi, "The Appendix: Useful and in Fact Promising", ''Live Science'', 2009, [http://www.livescience.com/10571-appendix-fact-promising.html Appendix has useful function]&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 study, however, refutes the idea of an inverse relationship between cecum size and appendix size and presence. It is widely present in [[euarchontoglires]] (a superorder of mammals that includes rodents and primates) and has also evolved [[Convergent evolution|independently]] in the [[diprotodont]] [[marsupials]], [[monotreme]]s, and is highly diverse in size and shape which could suggest it is not vestigial. Researchers deduce that the appendix has the ability to protect good bacteria in the gut. That way, when the gut is affected by a bout of diarrhea or other illness that cleans out the intestines, the good bacteria in the appendix can repopulate the digestive system and keep the person healthy.&lt;ref name=SEAL09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01809.x |pmid=19678866 |title=Comparative anatomy and phylogenetic distribution of the mammalian cecal appendix |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1984–99 |year=2009 |last1=Smith |first1=H.

=== Coccyx ===
The [[coccyx]], or tailbone, is the remnant of a lost [[tail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Spectrum of human tails: A report of six cases |author=Biswanath Mukhopadhyay, Ram M.

Kay }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tailbone, located at the end of the spine, has lost its original function in assisting balance and mobility, though it still serves some secondary functions, such as being an attachment point for muscles, which explains why it has not degraded further.  The coccyx serves as an attachment site for tendons, ligaments, and muscles. It also functions as an insertion point of some of the muscles of the pelvic floor.
In rare cases, congenital defect results in a [[Tail#Human tails|short tail-like structure]] being present at birth. Twenty-three cases of human babies born with such a structure have been reported in the medical literature since 1884.&lt;ref name=Dao&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0046-8177(84)80079-9 |pmid=6373560 |title=Human tails and pseudotails |journal=Human Pathology |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=449–53 |year=1984 |last1=Dao |first1=Anh H. |last2=Netsky |first2=Martin G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000637-198804000-00009 |pmid=3284435 |title=Detailing the Human Tail |journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=340–4 |year=1988 |last1=Dubrow |first1=Terry J. |last2=Wackym |first2=Phillip Ashley |last3=Lesavoy |first3=Malcolm A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases such as these, the spine and skull were determined to be entirely normal. The only abnormality was that of a tail approximately twelve centimeters long. These tails were able to be surgically removed, and the individuals have resumed normal lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3171/jns.1985.63.3.0461 |pmid=3894599 |title=The human tail: A benign stigma |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=461–2 |year=1985 |last1=Spiegelmann |first1=Roberto |last2=Schinder |first2=Edgardo |last3=Mintz |first3=Mordejai |last4=Blakstein |first4=Alexander }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wisdom teeth ===

[[Wisdom tooth|Wisdom teeth]] are vestigial third molars that human ancestors used to help in grinding down plant tissue. The common postulation is that the skulls of human ancestors had larger jaws with more teeth, which were possibly used to help chew down foliage to compensate for a lack of ability to efficiently digest the [[cellulose]] that makes up a plant cell wall. As human diets changed, smaller jaws were [[Natural Selection|naturally selected]], yet the third molars, or "wisdom teeth", still commonly develop in human mouths.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Dr. George B.

=== Vomeronasal organ ===
In some animals, the [[vomeronasal organ]] (VNO) is part of a second, completely separate sense of smell, known as the [[Olfaction|accessory olfactory system]]. Many studies have been performed to find if there is an actual presence of a VNO in adult human beings. Trotier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/25.4.369 |pmid=10944499 |title=The Vomeronasal Cavity in Adult Humans |journal=Chemical Senses |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=369–80 |year=2000 |last1=Trotier |first1=D. |last2=Eloit |first2=C |last3=Wassef |first3=M |last4=Talmain |first4=G |last5=Bensimon |first5=J.

The [[ear]]s of a [[macaque]] monkey and most other monkeys have far more developed muscles than those of humans, and therefore have the capability to move their ears to better hear potential threats.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. A. Macalister, Annals and Magazine of Natural History, vol. vii., 1871, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans and other primates such as the [[orangutan]] and [[chimpanzee]] however have ear [[muscle]]s that are minimally developed and non-functional, yet still large enough to be identifiable.&lt;ref name="Descent" /&gt; A muscle attached to the ear that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, can no longer be said to have any biological function. In humans there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and it can be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials.&lt;ref name="Descent" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bair|first1=J.

The outer structure of the ear also shows some vestigial features, such as the node or point on the helix of the ear known as [[Darwin's tubercle]] which is found in around 10% of the population.

=== Eye ===
The [[Plica semilunaris of conjunctiva|plica semilunaris]] is a small fold of tissue on the inside corner of the eye. It is the vestigial remnant of the [[nictitating membrane]], an organ that is fully functional in some other species of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Owen|Owen, R.]] 1866–1868. ''Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates''. London.{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its associated muscles are also vestigial.&lt;ref name="Descent" /&gt; Only one species of [[primate]], the [[Calabar angwantibo]], is known to have a functioning nictitating membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330250307 |pmid=5971502 |title=The skin of primates.

The [[orbitalis muscle]] is a vestigial or rudimentary nonstriated muscle (smooth muscle) of the eye that crosses from the infraorbital groove and sphenomaxillary fissure and is intimately united with the periosteum of the orbit. It was described by Johannes Peter Müller and is often called Müller's muscle. The muscle forms an important part of the lateral orbital wall in some animals, but in humans it is not known to have any significant function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=653491 |year=1978 |author1=Toerien |first1=M.

=== Reproductive system ===
{{Main|List of homologues of the human reproductive system}}

==== Genitalia ====
In the [[internal genitalia]] of each human sex, there are some residual organs of [[mesonephric duct|mesonephric]] and [[paramesonephric duct|paramesonephric]] ducts during embryonic development:
* [[Gartner's duct]]
* [[Epoophoron]]
* [[Vesicular appendages of epoophoron]]
* [[Paroophoron]]

Human vestigial structures also include leftover embryological remnants that once served a function during development, such as the belly button, and analogous structures between biological sexes. For example, men are also born with two nipples, which are not known to serve a function compared to women.&lt;ref&gt;"Breast Anatomy and Embryology." Essentials of Plastic Surgery (2015): 355-61&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to genitourinary development, both internal and external genitalia of male and female fetuses have the ability to fully or partially form their analogous [[phenotype]] of the opposite biological sex if exposed to a lack/overabundance of androgens or the SRY gene during fetal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(06)80172-1 |pmid=7965425 |title=True hermaphroditism: Genetic variants and clinical management |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=738–44 |year=1994 |last1=Hadjiathanasiou |first1=C.G. |last2=Brauner |first2=R. |last3=Lortat-Jacob |first3=S. |last4=Nivot |first4=S. |last5=Jaubert |first5=F. |last6=Fellous |first6=M. |last7=Nihoul-Fékété |first7=C. |last8=Rappaport |first8=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4274/jcrpe.2495 |pmid=26761946 |pmc=5096479 |title=Homozygous Ala65Pro Mutation with V89L Polymorphism in SRD5A2 Deficiency |journal=Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=218–23 |year=2016 |last1=Eren |first1=Erdal |last2=Edgünlü |first2=Tuba |last3=Asut |first3=Emre |last4=Karakaş Çelik |first4=Sevim }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of vestigial remnants of genitourinary development include the [[hymen]], which is a [[membrane]] that surrounds or partially covers the external [[vagina]]l opening that derives from the sinus tubercle during fetal development and is homologous to the male [[seminal colliculus]].&lt;ref name=Healey2010&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/174_2010_128 |chapter=Embryology of the Female Reproductive Tract |title=Imaging of Gynecological Disorders in Infants and Children |pages=21–30 |series=Medical Radiology |year=2010 |last1=Healey |first1=Andrew |isbn=978-3-540-85601-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers{{who|date=January 2013}} have hypothesized that the persistence of the hymen may be to provide temporary protection from [[infection]], as it separates the vaginal lumen from the urogenital sinus cavity during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2008.03.009 |pmid=19646660 |title=Hymen Sparing Surgery for Imperforate Hymen: Case Reports and Review of Literature |journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=e61–4 |year=2009 |last1=Basaran |first1=Mustafa |last2=Usal |first2=Deniz |last3=Aydemir |first3=Cumhur }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include the [[glans penis]] and the [[clitoris]], the [[labia minora]] and the ventral penis, and the ovarian follicles and the seminiferous tubules.&lt;ref name=Healey2010/&gt;

In modern times, there is controversy regarding whether the [[foreskin]] is a vital or vestigial structure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Roger|date=2011-11-22|title=Vital or vestigial?

He wrote, “It is often stated that the prepuce is a vestigial structure devoid of function... However, it seems to be no accident that during the years when the child is incontinent the glans is completely clothed by the prepuce, for, deprived of this protection, the glans becomes susceptible to injury from contact with sodden clothes or napkin.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During the physical act of sex, the foreskin reduces friction, which can reduce the need for additional sources of lubrication.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; "Some medical researchers, however, claim [[Circumcision|circumcised]] men enjoy sex just fine and that, in view of recent research on HIV transmission, the foreskin causes more trouble than it’s worth."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The area of the outer forskin measures between 7–100 cm2,&lt;ref&gt;Kigozi G, Wawer M, Ssettuba A, et al. .

Regarding vestigial structures, Charles Darwin wrote, “An organ, when rendered useless, may well be variable, for its variations cannot be checked by natural selection.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Darwin C. The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. London, UK: John Murray; 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; In the March 2017 publication of the Global Health Journal: Science and Practice, Morris and Krieger wrote, "The variability in foreskin size is consistent with the foreskin being a vestigial structure."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Morris BJ, Krieger JN, Klausner JD|date=March 2017|title=CDC's Male Circumcision Recommendations Represent a Key Public Health Measure|url=http://www.ghspjournal.org/content/5/1/15|journal=Global Health, Science and Practice|volume=5|issue=1|pages=15–27|doi=10.9745/GHSP-D-16-00390|pmc=5478224|pmid=28351877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Darwin speculated that the sensitivity of the foreskin to fine touch might have served as an “early warning system” in our naked ancestors while it protected the glans from the intrusion of biting insects and parasites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Musculature ===
A number of [[muscles]] in the human body are thought to be vestigial, either by virtue of being greatly reduced in size compared to homologous muscles in other species, by having become principally tendonous, or by being highly variable in their frequency within or between populations.

==== Head ====
The Occipitalis Minor is a muscle in the back of the head which normally joins to the [[auricular muscles]] of the ear. This muscle is very sporadic in frequency—always present in Malays, in 56% of Africans, 50% of Japanese, 36% of Europeans, and is nonexistent in the [[Khoikhoi]] people of southwestern Africa and in [[Melanesia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30079154 |first1=Alexander |last1=Macalister |year=1875 | title =Additional Observations on Muscular Anomalies in Human Anatomy.

The platysma, a quadrangular (four sides) muscle in a sheet-like configuration, is a vestigial remnant of the panniculous carnosus of animals. In horses, it is the muscle that allows it to flick a fly off its back.

==== Face ====
In many non-human mammals, the upper lip and sinus area is associated with [[whiskers]] or vibrissae which serve a sensory function. In humans, these whiskers do not exist but there are still sporadic cases where elements of the associated vibrissal capsular muscles or sinus hair muscles can be found. Based on histological studies of the upper lips of 20 cadavers, Tamatsu et al. found that structures resembling such muscles were present in 35% (7/20) of their specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ca.20497 |pmid=17458869 |title=Vestiges of vibrissal capsular muscles exist in the human upper lip |journal=Clinical Anatomy |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=628–31 |year=2007 |last1=Tamatsu |first1=Yuichi |last2=Tsukahara |first2=Kazue |last3=Hotta |first3=Mitsuyuki |last4=Shimada |first4=Kazuyuki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arm ====
The [[palmaris longus muscle]] is seen as a small tendon between the [[flexor carpi radialis]] and the [[flexor carpi ulnaris]], although it is not always present. The muscle is absent in about 14% of the population, however this varies greatly with ethnicity. It is believed that this muscle actively participated in the arboreal locomotion of primates, but currently has no function, because it does not provide more grip strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2014/178906 |pmid=24860810 |pmc=4016873 |title=Morphometric and Statistical Analysis of the Palmaris Longus Muscle in Human and Non-Human Primates |journal=BioMed Research International |volume=2014 |pages=1-6 |year=2014 |last1=Aversi-Ferreira |first1=Roqueline A.

The [[pyramidalis muscle]] of the abdomen is a small and triangular muscle, anterior to the [[rectus abdominis]], and contained in the [[rectus sheath]]. It is absent in 20% of humans and when absent, the lower end of the rectus then becomes proportionately increased in size. Anatomical studies suggest that the forces generated by the pyramidalis muscles are relatively small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1447-073X.2007.00226.x |pmid=19159363 |pmc=3531545 |title=Architecture and fiber type of the pyramidalis muscle |journal=Anatomical Science International |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=294–7 |year=2008 |last1=Lovering |first1=Richard M. |last2=Anderson |first2=Larry D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] of the back has several sporadic [[Latissimus dorsi muscle#Variations|variations]]. One particular variant is the existence of the dorsoepitrochlearis or latissimocondyloideus muscle which is a muscle passing from the tendon of the latissimus dorsi to the long head of the [[triceps brachii]]. It is notable due to its well developed character in other apes and monkeys, where it is an important climbing muscle, namely the dorsoepitrochlearis brachii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ca.20799 |pmid=19373904 |title=Development and clinical significance of the musculus dorsoepitrochlearis in men |journal=Clinical Anatomy |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=481–8 |year=2009 |last1=P. |first1=Haninec |last2=R. |first2=Tomáš |last3=R. |first3=Kaiser |last4=R. |first4=Čihák }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, William E., ''The Musculoskeletal Anatomy of the Thorax and Brachium of an Adult Female Chimpanzee'',6571st Aeromedical Research Laboratory, New Mexico, 1965. http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/462433.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This muscle is found in ≈5% of humans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anatomyatlases.org/AnatomicVariants/MuscularSystem/Text/L/06Latissimus.shtml{{full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Leg ====
The [[plantaris muscle]] is composed of a thin muscle belly and a long thin tendon. The muscle belly is approximately {{convert|5|-|10|cm|inch|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} long, and is absent in 7–10% of the human population. It has some weak functionality in moving the knee and ankle but is generally considered redundant and is often used as a source of tendon for grafts. The long, thin tendon of the plantaris is humorously called "the freshman's nerve", as it is often mistaken for a nerve by first-year medical students.

==== Tongue ====
Another intriguing example of human vestigiality occurs in the tongue, specifically the chondroglossus muscle.  In a morphological study of 100 Japanese cadavers, it was found that 86% of fibers identified were solid and bundled in the appropriate way to facilitate speech and mastication.  The other 14% of fibers were short, thin and sparse – nearly useless, and thus concluded to be of vestigial origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0940-9602(02)80087-5 |pmid=12392330 |title=Morphological study of the human chondroglossus muscle in Japanese |journal=Annals of Anatomy - Anatomischer Anzeiger |volume=184 |issue=5 |pages=493–9 |year=2002 |last1=Ogata |first1=Shigemitsu |last2=Mine |first2=Kazuharu |last3=Tamatsu |first3=Yuichi |last4=Shimada |first4=Kazuyuki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breasts ===
[[Supernumerary nipple|Extra nipples]] or [[Accessory breast|breasts]] sometimes appear along the [[Milk line|mammary lines]] of humans, appearing as a remnant to mammalian ancestors who possessed more than two nipples or breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kajava | first1 = Y | year = 1915 | title = The proportions of supernumerary nipples in the Finnish population | url = | journal = Duodecim | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 143–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0971-6866.108051 |pmid=23716953 |pmc=3656534 |title=Seven nipples in a male: World′s second case report |journal=Indian Journal of Human Genetics |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=373–5 |year=2012 |last1=Goyal |first1=Tarang |last2=Bakshi |first2=SK |last3=Varshney |first3=Anupam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral ==
[[File:Gaensehaut.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Goose bumps]] are an example of a vestigial human reaction to stress.]]
Humans also bear some vestigial behaviors and reflexes.&lt;ref name=Spinney&gt;{{Citation|title=Remnants of evolution |author=Laura Spinney |journal=New Scientist |year=2008 |volume=198 |issue=2656 |pages=42–45 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(08)61231-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the formation of [[goose bumps]] in humans under [[stress (medicine)|stress]] is a vestigial [[reflex action|reflex]]; a possible function in human evolutionary ancestors was to raise the body's hair, making the ancestor appear larger and scaring off predators.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. (1872) ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' John Murray, London.{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spinney/&gt; Raising the hair is also used to trap an extra layer of air, keeping an animal warm.&lt;ref name=Spinney/&gt; Due to the diminished amount of hair in humans, the reflex formation of goose bumps when cold is also vestigial.&lt;ref name=Spinney/&gt;

The [[palmar grasp reflex]] is supported to be a vestigial behavior in human infants. When placing a finger or object to the palm of an infant, it will securely grasp it. This grasp is found to be rather strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychology |edition=fifth |author=Peter Gray |year=2007 |page=66 |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-0617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[infant]]s—37% according to a 1932 study—are able to support their own weight from a rod,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OzL2Bgvf9Q0C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22chancy+and+mcgraw+(31)+investigated+the+reflex+in+the+125+infants%22%22 Behavior Development in Infants] (via Google Books) by Evelyn Dewey, citing a study "Reflexes and other motor activities in newborn infants: a report of 125 cases as a preliminary study of infant behavior" published in the ''Bull. Neurol. Inst. New York'', 1932, Vol. 2, pp. 1–56.&lt;/ref&gt;, although there is no way they can cling to their mother. The grasp is also evident in the feet too. When a baby is sitting down, its prehensile feet assume a curled-in posture, similar to that observed in an adult chimp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |author=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |pages=85–86 |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archetype: A Natural History of the Self |author=Anthony Stevens |year=1982 |page=87 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |isbn=978-0-7100-0980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ancestral primate would have had sufficient body hair to which an infant could cling unlike modern humans, thus allowing its mother to escape from danger, such as climbing up a tree in the presence of a predator without having to occupy her hands holding her baby.

It has been proposed that the [[hiccup]] is an evolutionary remnant of earlier [[amphibian]] [[respiratory system|respiration]].&lt;ref name=Straus&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bies.10224 |pmid=12539245 |title=A phylogenetic hypothesis for the origin of hiccough |journal=BioEssays |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=182–8 |year=2003 |last1=Straus |first1=C. |last2=Vasilakos |first2=K. |last3=Wilson |first3=R. J. A. |last4=Oshima |first4=T. |last5=Zelter |first5=M. |last6=Derenne |first6=J-Ph. |last7=Similowski |first7=T. |last8=Whitelaw |first8=W. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amphibians such as tadpoles gulp air and water across their gills via a rather simple motor reflex akin to mammalian hiccuping. The motor pathways that enable hiccuping form early during fetal development, before the motor pathways that enable normal lung ventilation form. Thus, according to recapitulation theory, the hiccup is evolutionarily antecedent to modern lung respiration. Additionally, they point out that hiccups and amphibian gulping are inhibited by elevated CO{{Sub2}} and may be stopped by [[GABAB receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] agonists, illustrating a possible shared physiology and evolutionary heritage. These proposals may explain why premature infants spend 2.5% of their time hiccuping, possibly gulping like amphibians, as their lungs are not yet fully formed. Fetal intrauterine hiccups are of two types. The physiological type occurs before 28 weeks after conception and tend to last five to ten minutes. These hiccups are part of fetal development and are associated with the myelination of the [[phrenic nerve]], which primarily controls the thoracic diaphragm. The phylogeny hypothesis explains how the hiccup reflex might have evolved, and if there is not an explanation, it may explain hiccups as an evolutionary remnant, held-over from our amphibious ancestors.
This hypothesis has been questioned because of the existence of the afferent loop of the reflex, the fact that it does not explain the reason for glottic closure, and because the very short contraction of the hiccup is unlikely to have a significant strengthening effect on the slow-twitch muscles of respiration.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for most of this paragraph. Also, what is the second type of fetal intrauterine hiccups?|date=May 2015}}

== Molecular ==
{{further|Pseudogene}}
There are also vestigial molecular structures in humans, which are no longer in use but may indicate common ancestry with other species. One example of this is [[L-gulonolactone oxidase]], a gene that is functional in most other mammals and produces an [[enzyme]] that synthesizes [[vitamin C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0304-4165(99)00123-3 |pmid=10572964 |title=Random nucleotide substitutions in primate nonfunctional gene for l-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase, the missing enzyme in l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects |volume=1472 |issue=1–2 |pages=408–11 |year=1999 |last1=Ohta |first1=Yuriko |last2=Nishikimi |first2=Morimitsu }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans and other members of the suborder [[Haplorrhini]], a mutation disabled the gene and made it unable to produce the enzyme. However, the remains of the gene are still present in the [[human genome]] as a vestigial genetic sequence called a [[pseudogene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nishikimi M, Fukuyama R, Minoshima S, Shimizu N, Yagi K |title=Cloning and chromosomal mapping of the human nonfunctional gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the enzyme for L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis missing in man |journal=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5628">In [[population genetics]] an '''idealised population''' is one that can be described using a number of simplifying assumptions. Models of idealised populations are either used to make a general point, or they are fit to data on real populations for which the assumptions may not hold true. For example, [[coalescent theory]] is used to fit data to models of idealised populations.&lt;ref&gt;.	Nielsen, Rasmus, and Montgomery Slatkin. An Introduction to Population Genetics: Theory and Applications. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common idealized population in population genetics is described in the [[Genetic drift#Wright.E2.80.93Fisher model|Wright-Fisher model]] after [[Sewall Wright]] and [[Ronald Fisher]] (1922, 1930) and  (1931). Wright-Fisher [[population]]s have constant size, and their members can [[Sexual intercourse|mate]] and [[reproduce]] with any other member. Another example is a [[Genetic drift#Moran model|Moran model]], which has overlapping [[generation]]s, rather than the non-overlapping generations of the Fisher-Wright model. The complexities of real populations can cause their behavior to match an idealised population with an [[effective population size]] that is very different from the census population size of the real population. For sexual [[diploids]], idealized populations will have genotype frequencies related to the allele frequencies according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

==Hardy-Weinberg==
In 1908, G. H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg modeled an idealised population to demonstrate that in the absence of selection, migration, random genetic drift, allele frequencies stay constant over time, and that in the presence of random mating, genotype frequencies are related to allele frequencies according to a [[binomial square principle]] called the Hardy-Weinberg law.&lt;ref&gt;.Crow, James F. "Population genetics history: a personal view." Annual Review of Genetics 21, no. 1 (1987): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in population dynamics==
A good example of usage idealised population model, in tracking natural population conditions, could be found in a research of [[Joe Roman]] and [[Stephen R. Palumbi]] (2003). Using [[genetic diversity]] data, they questioned: have populations of North Atlantic great whales recovered enough for commercial whaling?  To calculate genetic diversity the authors multiply long term [[effective population]] size of the females by two, assuming [[sex ratio]] 1:1, and then multiply by mitochondrial genes substitution rate, per generation. Making several assumptions according to the sex ratio and number of juveniles, they were able to calculate that in contrast to historical records, modern whale populations are far from harvestable range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Whales before whaling in the North Atlantic|first1 = Joe|last1 = Roman|authorlink1 = Joe Roman|first2 = Stephen R.|last2 = Palumbi|authorlink2 = Stephen Palumbi|journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]|url = https://mcbi.marine-conservation.org/publications/pub_pdfs/Roman_Palumbi_2003.pdf|volume = 301|issue = 5632|year = 2003|pages = 508-510|doi = 10.1126/science.1084524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to population history==
Idealised population models could not only provide us with information about present populations conditions but as well are useful in revealing natural history and population dynamics in the past. Using an idealised population model, Anders Eriksson and Andrea Manica (2012) tested the hypothesis of the [[archaic human admixture with modern humans]]. The authors compare genome sequences of two human populations, Neanderthals and chimpanzee. Eriksson and Manica created a stepping stone model under which Africa and Eurasia are represented as a string of equal size populations. They concluded that under the [[stepping stone model]], in which Europeans can exchange genetic information with Asians and not with Africans, similarities between Neanderthal genome and Eurasian could be explained by ancient populations structure.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksson, Anders, and Andrea Manica. "Effect of ancient population structure on the degree of polymorphism shared between modern human populations and ancient hominins." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109, no. 35 (2012): 13956-13960.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer simulations==
Usage of models, also allows to perform [[simulation]]s, including in silica ones, to hypothesize evolutionary outcomes. As an example, [http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/popgen/popg.html/ PopG ] is a free [[computer program]] that is capable of simulating simultaneous evolution of populations based on Fisher-Wright model. Idealised population model also, could be used in several simple simulations designed for education. So, [http://www.animalplanet.com/wild-animals/darwin-survive-game.htm/ Charles Darwin: Can you survive?] Simulation is designed to introduce general public to the concept of natural selection. Another example is [http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/simulations/drift.html/ Genetic Drift] simulator (Requires an updated Java version), which is designed to visualize influence of genetic drift on natural populations.

The '''International Society of Zoological Sciences (ISZS)''' was founded to encourage research, education, and communication in [[zoology]]. The society includes both individual scholars, and [[Professional association|professional organizations]]. It particularly tries to increase the availability of research resources and enhance cooperation between different [[Zoology#Branches of zoology|branches of zoology]].

== History ==

To summarize from Francis Dov Por's "The Road to the International Society of Zoological Sciences"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalzoology.org/index-new/road-to-iszs.htm&lt;/ref&gt; "Zoology ... was among the very first disciplines to build an [[international organization]]. Congresses of Zoology started in 1889 on the initiative of the [[Société zoologique de France]] on the occasion of the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|International Exposition]] in Paris. Congresses were then held at regular intervals and attendance increased from congress to congress, from a few tens in Paris and in Moscow to 700 in [[Budapest]] in 1927. The London Congress set a target of 1000 and in Washington the number reached 2500.

The Congresses were also growing in complexity, resulting in part because of the emerging [[Academic specialization|specialization]] of different fields of zoology. In London in 1958 there were eight to nine daily parallel sessions. In Washington an attempt was made to organize [[Academic conference|symposia]] instead and there were no less than 29: the problem of unifying subjects became more important than the numbers of participants.

The Washington Congress decided that the Board of the Division of Zoology of the newly founded [[IUBS]], would assume in the future the role of the 'Comite Permanent' and would be responsible for ensuring the continuity of Zoological Congresses. This did not work and the new International Congresses of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology (ICSEB) took over the role of the Zoological Congresses.

A gallant effort was made in 1972 by [[Étienne de la Vaissière|Vaissiere]] and French colleagues to convene a XVII International Congress of Zoology in [[Monte Carlo]]. However, attendance was poor and the proceedings were never published. A long hiatus then began. An international focus became the problem of [[Extinction|vanishing species]]. Instead, what followed in the next two decades was the vanishing of zoology from the international academic agenda.  The names of university departments and research centers were rapidly changed in order to avoid use of the word 'zoology'.

With the aid of [[Telecommunication#Modern telecommunication|modern communications]] and technology a reunification of the fractured specialties of zoology became possible. The concept of an integrative zoology, synthesizing data and results ranging from [[molecular biology]] to [[behavior]], gained wide acceptance. The XVIII International Congress of Zoology was held in [[Athens]] in Greece in August 2000. The symposium program of the Congress presented a cross-zoological picture of the many levels of zoological inquiry, both horizontal and vertical. Attendance in Athens was far from the incommunicable thousands in the last congresses, but was considered by all as an unmitigated success.

Subsequently, the IUBS approved the (re)formation of an international zoological body (the ISZS) as proposed by Zhibin Zhang, John Buckeridge and Francis Dov Por in Beijing in 2004, and an Executive Committee was elected and charged with organizing International Congresses of Zoology and providing a global voice for zoologists."

== Structure ==

As if at the end of 2013,the ISZS has 1032 individual members and 113 institutional members, having a coverage of over 30,000 zoologists,scientists and research workers all over the world. The Institutional Members include national zoological organizations, universities, non-governmental organizations and [[Academy of Sciences|academies of science]].

ISZS is managed by an international Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.globalzoology.org/dct/page/70010 Official site of the ISZS]&lt;/ref&gt;  The current President is [[Zhibin Zhang]] (China). Immediate Past Presidents include: Jean-Marc Jallon (France), John Buckeridge (Australia) and Dov Por (Israel).

The Secretariat of the ISZS is located at C-506, Institute of Zoology, [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], 1 Beichen West Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100101, China.The current Secretary General is Chunxu Han (China).

An '''introduced species''' ('''alien species''', '''exotic species''', '''non-indigenous species''', or '''non-native species''') is a [[species]] living outside its [[indigenous (ecology)|native]] distributional [[range (biology)|range]], but which has arrived there by [[human]] activity, either deliberate or accidental. Non-native species can have various effects on the local ecosystem.  Introduced species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction are called [[invasive species]]. The impact of introduced species is highly variable. Some have a negative effect on a local ecosystem, while other introduced species may have no negative effect or only minor impact. Some species have been introduced intentionally to combat pests. They are called [[biocontrol]]s and may be regarded as beneficial as an alternative to pesticides in agriculture for example. In some instances the potential for being beneficial or detrimental in the long run remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Dov Sax, Aug 2008. [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/suppl.1/11490.full The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706102943/http://www.pnas.org/content/105/suppl.1/11490.full |date=July 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The effects of introduced species on natural environments have gained much scrutiny from scientists, governments, farmers and others.

== Terminology: introduced species and subsets  ==
{{Life timeline}}
The formal definition of an introduced species, from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], is ''A species that has been intentionally or inadvertently brought into a region or area. Also called an exotic or non-native species.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment. September 16, 2003. Introduced species. Web site at [http://search.epa.gov/epasearch/epasearch?typeofsearch=epa&amp;client=new_frontend&amp;epasearch&amp;&amp;filter=sample4filt.hts&amp;fld&amp;url_directory&amp;federated=no&amp;max_results=200&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fmaia%2Fhtml%2Fintro-species.html&amp;result_template=2col.ftl&amp;areaname&amp;areapagehead=epafiles_pagehead&amp;areapagefoot=epafiles_pagefoot&amp;areasidebar=search_sidebar&amp;stylesheet&amp;sort=term_relevancy&amp;faq=true&amp;results_per_page=20&amp;cluster=both&amp;sessionid=A6EA2542B3CE0920A94CACBE45CED381&amp;querytext=introduced%20species&amp;q=introduced%20species%20definition US EPA]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many terms associated with introduced species that represent subsets of introduced species, and the terminology associated with introduced species is now in flux for various reasons. Examples of these terms are ''acclimatized'', ''[[adventive species|adventive]]'', ''naturalized'', and ''immigrant''  species but those terms refer to a subset of introduced species. The term "invasive" is used to describe introduced species when the introduced species causes substantial damage to the area in which it was introduced.

'''Subset descriptions:'''

:Acclimatized species: Introduced species that have changed physically and/or behaviorally in order to adjust to their new environment.  Acclimatized species are not necessarily optimally adjusted to their new environment and may just be physically/behaviorally sufficient for the new environment.

:[[Adventive species]]

:Naturalized species (plants): A naturalized plant species refers to a non-native plant that does not need human help to reproduce and maintain its population in an area that it is not native to.

'''General description of introduced species:'''

In the broadest and most widely used sense, an introduced species is synonymous with ''non-native'' and therefore applies as well to most garden and farm organisms; these adequately fit the basic definition given above. However, some sources add to that basic definition "and are now reproducing in the wild",&lt;ref name="carlton2002"&gt;Carlton, James T. 2002. ''Introduced Species in U.S. Coastal Waters''. Pew Oceans Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; which removes from consideration as ''introduced'' species that were raised or grown in gardens or farms that do not survive without tending by people. With respect to plants, these latter are in this case defined as either ''ornamental'' or ''cultivated'' plants.

===Invasive species===

Introduction of a species outside its native range is all that is required to be qualified as an "introduced species" such that one can distinguish between introduced species that may not occur except in cultivation, under domestication or captivity whereas others become established outside their native range and reproduce without human assistance. Such species might be termed "naturalized", "established", "wild non-native species". If they further spread beyond the place of introduction and cause damage to nearby species, they are called "invasive". The transition from introduction, to establishment and to invasion has been described in the context of plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/ddi/2000/00000006/00000002/art00003= Richardson et al. 2000]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced species are essentially "non-native" species. Invasive species are those introduced species that spreadwidely or quickly and cause harm, be that to the environment,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070303161312/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/publications/policy/invasivesEng.htm biodiversity]&lt;/ref&gt; human health, other valued resources or the economy. There have been calls from scientists to consider a species "invasive" only in terms of their spread and reproduction rather than the harm they may cause.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x A neutral terminology to define ‘invasive’ species - Colautti and MacIsaac 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a practical definition, an [[invasive species]] is one that has been introduced and become a pest in its new location, spreading (invading) by natural means. The term is used to imply both a sense of urgency and actual or potential harm. For example, U.S. Executive Order 13112 (1999) defines "invasive species" as "an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health".&lt;ref&gt;CEQ (1999). Web site page with [http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/eos/eo13112.html Executive Order 13112] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515154626/http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/eos/eo13112.html |date=2008-05-15 }} text.&lt;/ref&gt; The biological definition of invasive species, on the other hand, makes no reference to the harm they may cause, only to the fact that they spread beyond the area of original introduction.

Although some argue that "invasive" is a loaded word and harm is difficult to define,&lt;ref name=carlton2002 /&gt; the fact of the matter is that organisms have and continue to be introduced to areas in which they are not native, sometimes with but usually without much regard to the harm that could result.

From a regulatory perspective, it is neither desirable nor practical to list as undesirable or outright ban all non-native species (although the [[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]] has adopted an approach that comes close to this). Regulations require a definitional distinction between non-natives that are deemed especially onerous and all others. Introduced ''pest species'' that are ''officially listed'' as invasive, best fit the definition of an ''invasive species''.  Early detection and rapid response is the most effective strategy for regulating a pest species and reducing economic and environmental impacts of an introduction &lt;ref&gt;2013. Invasive Species Program. Clemson University – DPI. http://www.clemson.edu/public/regulatory/plant_industry/invasive_exotic_programs/. Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]] prevents the introduction of any animal not naturally occurring in the wild or any of a list of both animals or plants introduced previously and proved to be invasive.

== Nature of introductions ==
By [[invasion biology terminology|definition]], a species is considered "introduced" when its transport into an area outside of its native range is human mediated.  Introductions by humans can be described as either intentional or accidental.  Intentional introductions have been motivated by individuals or groups who either (1) believe that the newly introduced species will be in some way beneficial to humans in its new location or, (2) species are introduced intentionally but with no regard to the potential impact.  Unintentional or accidental introductions are most often a byproduct of human movements, and are thus unbound to human motivations.  Subsequent range expansion of introduced species may or may not involve human activity.

=== Intentional introductions ===
Species that humans intentionally transport to new regions can subsequently become successfully established in two ways. In the first case, organisms are purposely released for establishment in the wild. It is sometimes difficult to predict whether a species will become established upon release, and if not initially successful, humans have made repeated introductions to improve the probability that the species will survive and eventually reproduce in the wild.  In these cases it is clear that the introduction is directly facilitated by human desires.
[[Image:Male Silver Pheasant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Male ''Lophura nycthemera'' ([[silver pheasant]]), a native of East Asia that has been introduced into parts of [[Europe]] for ornamental reasons.]]
In the second case, species intentionally transported into a new region may escape from captive or cultivated populations and subsequently establish independent breeding populations. Escaped organisms are included in this category because their initial transport to a new region is human motivated.

==== Motivations for intentional introductions ====

'''Economic:'''  Perhaps the most common motivation for introducing a species into a new place is that of economic gain. Non-native species can become such a common part of an environment, culture, and even diet that little thought is given to their geographic origin. For example, soybeans, kiwi fruit, [[wheat]], [[honey bees]], and all [[livestock]] except the [[American bison]] and the [[wild turkey|turkey]] are non-native species to North America. Collectively, non-native crops and livestock comprise 98% of US food.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Lori Lach, Rodolfo Zuniga, and Doug Morrison, Environmental and Economic Costs Associated with Non-Indigenous Species in the United States, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Cornell University (Ithaca, New York), June 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These and other benefits from non-natives are so vast that, according to the Congressional Research Service, they probably exceed the costs.&lt;ref&gt;Corn; Tim Johnson, "Invasive Species," The Burlington Free Press, November 9, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other examples of species introduced for the purposes of benefiting [[agriculture]], [[aquaculture]] or other economic activities are widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, R.L., S.L. Williams, and D.R. Strong.  2001.  Aquaculture—a gateway for exotic species.  Science 294: 1655–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eurasian carp]] was first introduced to the United States as a potential food source. The [[apple snail]] was released in Southeast Asia with the intent that it be used as a protein source, and subsequently to places like Hawaii to establish a food industry.  In Alaska, foxes were introduced to many islands to create new populations for the fur trade. About twenty species of African and European [[dung beetles]] have established themselves in Australia after deliberate introduction by the [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]] in an effort to reduce the impact of livestock manure. The timber industry promoted the introduction of Monterey pine (''[[Pinus radiata]]'') from California to Australia and New Zealand as a commercial timber crop.  These examples represent only a small subsample of species that have been moved by humans for economic interests.

The rise in the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s has added another potential economic advantage to introducing new/modified species into different environments.  Companies such as [[Monsanto]] that earn much of their profit through the selling of genetically modified seeds has added to the controversy surrounding introduced species.  The effect of genetically modified organisms varies from organism to organism and is still being researched today, however the rise of genetically modified organisms has added complexity to the conversations surrounding introduced species.

==== Human enjoyment ====
Introductions have also been important in supporting recreation activities or otherwise increasing human enjoyment.  Numerous fish and game animals have been introduced for the purposes of sport fishing and hunting ([[earthworms as invasive species]]).  The introduced amphibian (''[[Ambystoma tigrinum]]'') that threatens the endemic California salamander (''[[Ambystoma californiense]]'') was introduced to California as a source of bait for fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, SPD,  H.B. Shaffer, S.R. Voss, B.M. Fitzpatrick.  Hybridization between a rare, native tiger salamander and its introduced congener.  2003. Ecological Applications 13: 1263–1275.&lt;/ref&gt; Pet animals have also been frequently transported into new areas by humans, and their escapes have resulted in several successful introductions, such as those of feral cats and parrots.

Many plants have been introduced with the intent of aesthetically improving public recreation areas or private properties.  The introduced [[Norway maple]] for example occupies a prominent status in many of Canada's parks.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, J. and A. Sandberg.  Friends or foe? Invasive species and public green space in Toronto.  2004.  The Geographical Review 94: 178–198.&lt;/ref&gt; The transport of [[ornamental plants]] for landscaping use has and continues to be a source of many introductions.  Some of these species have escaped horticultural control and become invasive. Notable examples include [[water hyacinth]], [[salt cedar]], and [[purple loosestrife]]

In other cases, species have been translocated for reasons of "cultural nostalgia," which  refers to instances in which humans who have migrated to new regions have intentionally brought with them familiar organisms.  Famous examples include the introduction of [[starling]]s to North America by Englishman [[Eugene Schieffelin]], a lover of the works of Shakespeare and the chairman of the [[American Acclimatization Society]], who, it is rumoured, wanted to introduce all of the birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays into the United States.  He deliberately released eighty starlings into Central Park in New York City in 1890, and another forty in 1891.

Yet another prominent example of an introduced species that became invasive is the [[European rabbit]] in [[Rabbits in Australia|Australia]]. [[Thomas Austin]], a British landowner had rabbits released on his estate in Victoria because he missed hunting them. A more recent example is the introduction of the [[common wall lizard]] to North America by a [[Cincinnati]] boy, George Rau, around 1950 after a family vacation to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Deichsel, G. &amp; Gist, D. H. [http://www.lacerta.de/Themengebiete/Verschleppung%20und%20Aussetzung/Podarcis_muralis_in_Cincinnati.html On the Origin of the Common Wall Lizards Podarcis muralis (Reptilia: Lacertidae) in Cincinnati, Ohio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909153444/http://www.lacerta.de/Themengebiete/Verschleppung%20und%20Aussetzung/Podarcis_muralis_in_Cincinnati.html |date=2009-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Addressing environmental problems ====
Intentional introductions have also been undertaken with the aim of ameliorating environmental problems.  A number of fast spreading plants such as [[kudzu]] have been introduced as a means of [[erosion]] control. Other species have been introduced as [[biological control]] agents to control [[invasive species]] and involves the purposeful introduction of a [[natural enemy]] of the target species with the intention of reducing its numbers or controlling its spread.

A special case of introduction is the reintroduction of a species that has become locally endangered or extinct, done in the interests of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Shirey, P.D. and G.A. Lamberti. 2010. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123196255/PDFSTART Assisted colonization under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.] ''Conservation Letters'' 3(1): 45–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of successful reintroductions include wolves to [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the U.S., and the [[red kite]] to parts of England and Scotland.  Introductions or translocations of species have also been proposed in the interest of [[Conservation genetics|genetic conservation]], which advocates the introduction of new individuals into genetically depauperate populations of endangered or threatened species.&lt;ref&gt;Moritz, Craig. 1999. Conservation units and translocations: Strategies for conserving evolutionary processes.  Hereditas 130: 217–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above examples highlight the intent of humans to introduce species as a means of incurring some benefit. While these benefits have in some cases been realized, introductions have also resulted in unforeseen costs, particularly when introduced species take on characteristics of invasive species.

=== Unintentional introductions ===
Unintentional introductions occur when species are transported by human vectors.  Increasing rates of human travel are providing accelerating opportunities for species to be accidentally transported into areas in which they are not considered native.  For example, three species of [[rat]] (the black, Norway and Polynesian) have spread to most of the world as hitchhikers on ships, and [[arachnids]] such as scorpions and exotic spiders are sometimes transported to areas far beyond their native range by riding in shipments of tropical fruit. There are also numerous examples of marine organisms being transported in [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|ballast water]], one being the [[zebra mussel]].  Over 200 species have been introduced to the [[San Francisco Bay]] in this manner making it the most heavily invaded estuary in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A.N. And J.T. Carlton. 1998.  Accelerating invasion rate in a highly invaded estuary.  Science 279: 555–558.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also the accidental release of the Africanized honey bees (AHB), known colloquially as "killer bees" or [[Africanized bee]] to Brazil in 1957 and the [[Asian carps]] to the United States. The insect commonly known as the [[brown marmorated stink bug]] (''Halyomorpha halys'') was introduced accidentally in Pennsylvania. Another form of unintentional introductions is when an intentionally introduced plant carries a parasite or herbivore with it. Some become invasive, for example the [[Aphis nerii|oleander aphid]], accidentally introduced with the ornamental plant, [[oleander]].

Most accidentally or intentionally introduced species do not become invasive as the ones  mentioned above. For instance Some 179 coccinellid species have been introduced to the U.S. and Canada; about 27 of these non-native species have become established, and only a handful can be considered invasive, including the intentionally introduced ''Harmonia axyridis'', multicolored Asian lady beetle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://biostor.org/reference/56473|title= Field guide to recently introduced species of coccinellidae (Coleoptera) in North America, with a revised key to north American genera of coccinellini }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the small percentage of introduced species that become invasive can produce profound ecological changes. In North America ''Harmonia axyridis'' has become the most abundant lady beetle and probably accounts for more observations than all the native lady beetles put together.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lostladybug.org/summary-page-555.php Lost Ladybug Project&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduced plants ==
[[File:Horse-chestnut_800.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Aesculus|horse chestnut]] tree, ''[[Aesculus hippocastanum]]''. Native to Greece, it has been introduced across most of Europe and parts of North America as an ornamental plant. The horse chestnut tree is an example of a non-invasive introduced species, as while it is foreign it has naturalised and integrated into the ecosystems it was introduced to without apparent negative effects on native species there]]
Many non-native plants have been introduced into new territories, initially as either [[ornamental plant]]s or for [[erosion]] control, stock feed, or forestry.  Whether an exotic will become an [[invasive species]] is seldom understood in the beginning, and many non-native ornamentals languish in the trade for years before suddenly naturalizing and becoming invasive.

Peaches, for example, originated in China, and have been carried to much of the populated world. Tomatoes are native to the Andes. Squash (pumpkins), maize (corn), and tobacco are native to the Americas, but were introduced to the Old World. Many introduced species require continued human intervention to survive in the new environment. Others may become feral, but do not seriously [[interspecific competition|compete]] with natives, but simply increase the biodiversity of the area.

[[Dandelions]] are also introduced species to North America.

A very troublesome marine species in southern Europe is the [[seaweed]] ''[[Caulerpa taxifolia]]''. ''Caulerpa'' was first observed in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in 1984, off the coast of [[Monaco]]. By 1997, it had covered some 50&amp;nbsp;km². It has a strong potential to overgrow natural [[biotope]]s, and represents a major risk for sublittoral [[ecosystem]]s. The origin of the alga in the Mediterranean was thought to be either as a migration through the [[Suez Canal]] from the Red Sea, or as an accidental introduction from an aquarium.  Another troublesome plant species is the terrestrial plant ''Phyla canescens,'' which was intentionally introduced into many countries in North America, Europe, and Africa as an ornamental plant.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, K. 1992.

[[Japanese knotweed]] grows profusely in many nations.  Human beings introduced it into many places in the 19th century.  It is a source of [[resveratrol]], a dietary supplement.

== Introduced animals ==
Bear in mind that most introduced species do not become invasive. Examples of introduced animals that have become invasive include the [[gypsy moth]] in eastern [[North America]], the [[zebra mussel]] and [[alewife]] in the [[Great Lakes]], the [[Canada goose]] and [[Eastern gray squirrel|gray squirrel]] in Europe, the [[muskrat]] in Europe and Asia, the [[cane toad]] and [[red fox]] in Australia, [[Coypu|nutria]] in North America, Eurasia, and [[Africa]], and the [[common brushtail possum]] in [[New Zealand]]. In Taiwan, the success of introduced bird species was related to their native range size and body size; larger species with larger native range sizes were found to have larger introduced range sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Su, S.|author2=Cassey, P. | author3=Dyer, E. E.|author4=Blackburn, T. M.   | year=2017| title=Geographical range expansion of alien birds and environmental matching| journal=Ibis| volume=159| pages=193–203| url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.12418/full| doi=10.1111/ibi.12418| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notoriously devastating introduced species is the Small Indian Mongoose (Herpestes Javanicus Auropunctatus). Originating in a region encompassing Iran and India, it was introduced to the West Indies and Hawaii in the late 1800s for pest control. Since it has thrived on prey unequipped to deal with its speed, nearly leading to the local extinction of a variety of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Sarah|title=00 of the world's worst invasive alien species: a selection from the global invasive species database|journal=Auckland: Invasive Species Specialist Group|date=2000|volume=12|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Most commonly introduced species ===

Some species, such as the [[brown rat]], [[house sparrow]], [[common pheasant|ring-necked pheasant]] and [[European starling]], have been introduced very widely. In addition there are some [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[pet]] species that frequently become [[feral]]; these include [[rabbit]]s, [[dog]]s, [[domestic duck|duck]]s, [[goat]]s, [[fish]], [[pig]]s and [[cat]]s.

== Genetics ==
When a new species is introduced, the species could potentially breed with members of native species, producing hybrids.  The effect of the creating of hybrids can range from having little effect, a negative effect, to having devastating effects on native species.  Potential negative effects include hybrids that are less fit for their environment resulting in a population decrease.   This was seen in the Atlantic Salmon population when high levels of escape from Atlantic Salmon farms into the wild populations resulted in hybrids that had reduced survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGinnity|first=Philip|last2=Prodöhl|first2=Paulo|last3=Ferguson|first3=Andy|last4=Hynes|first4=Rosaleen|last5=Maoiléidigh|first5=Niall ó|last6=Baker|first6=Natalie|last7=Cotter|first7=Deirdre|last8=O'Hea|first8=Brendan|last9=Cooke|first9=Declan|date=2003-12-07|title=Fitness reduction and potential extinction of wild populations of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, as a result of interactions with escaped farm salmon|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/1532/2443|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=270|issue=1532|pages=2443–2450|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2520|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1691531|pmid=14667333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential positive effects include adding to the [[genetic diversity]] of the population which can increase the [[adaptation]] ability of the population and increase the number of healthy individuals within a population. This was seen in the introduction of guppies in Trinidad to encourage population growth and introduce new alleles into the population.  The results of this introduction included increased levels of [[heterozygosity]] and a larger population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Sarah W.|last2=Gerberich|first2=Jill C.|last3=Angeloni|first3=Lisa M.|last4=Bailey|first4=Larissa L.|last5=Broder|first5=Emily D.|last6=Torres-Dowdall|first6=Julian|last7=Handelsman|first7=Corey A.|last8=López-Sepulcre|first8=Andrés|last9=Reznick|first9=David N.|date=2016-08-01|title=Gene flow from an adaptively divergent source causes rescue through genetic and demographic factors in two wild populations of Trinidadian guppies|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12356/abstract|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=879–891|doi=10.1111/eva.12356|issn=1752-4571|pmc=4947150|pmid=27468306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaac Fanous''' ({{Lang-cop|ⲓⲥⲁⲁⲕ ⲫⲁⲛⲟⲩⲥ}}; December 19, 1919 &amp;ndash; January 14, 2007) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] artist and scholar, who specialized in [[Coptic art]] and founded its contemporary school.

==Early life and teaching==
Fanous was born in [[Minya, Egypt|Al-Minya]] and moved to [[Cairo]] to gain his degree from The Faculty of [[Applied arts]] now part of [[Helwan University]] in Egypt in 1941 and got a diploma in teaching in 1943.
Fanous was one of the first students of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] founded in 1954 and he obtained his doctorate in 1958 . His two-year study grant in the [[Louvre]] in the mid- 1960s was a turning point in his career. He took the opportunity, while in France, to study icon painting under [[Léonid Ouspensky]], under whose patronage he developed a passion both as artist and theologian. This would lead, eventually, to his developing a style that was to become the new face of [[Copts|Coptic]] [[iconography]] in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="weekly.ahram.org.eg"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/829/cu2.htm AlAhram weekly article on Isaac Fanous] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216041300/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/829/cu2.htm |date=2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elahram.com/Index.asp?CurFN=writ4.htm&amp;DID=9099|title=Elahram.com|website=elahram.com|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanous chaired the Coptic Art department at the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] in [[Cairo]], and he has trained a number of other [[Copt]]ic artists from outside Egypt.

==Political changes==
As wealthy patrons of the arts disappeared from Egypt's hitherto cosmopolitan art world following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]], they were replaced by the state, and the career of Fanous took off from the struggles and experiences of his time. That is to say, he became more keenly aware of his Egyptian heritage. He was proud of everything that comes from [[Minya, Egypt|Al-Minya]] since the time of [[Akhnaten]], who built his city in this area.&lt;ref name="copts-united.com"&gt;[http://www.copts-united.com/wrr/go1.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1169064300&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=79&amp; Copts United article in Arabic by Shafik Botrous]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Coptic iconography==
For centuries before painters like Isaac Fanous the [[Coptic Orthodox]] church had its own style which is recognised as The Coptic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/Copticar.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online -- Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|website=www.bartleby.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202192654/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/Copticar.html|archivedate=2007-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of the European art spread to Egypt in the nineteenth Century there are a lot of the Churches in [[Egypt]] which have [[Icon]]s that are similar to a lot of the European (Western) Christianity Iconography style.

Fanous's contemporary school of icon painting came about as part of a general renaissance of Coptic culture which began during the patriarchate of [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Pope Cyril VI]] (1959–1971).&lt;ref name="copts-united.com"/&gt;

He capitalised on the already established Coptic style which could be seen in historic Coptic  Churches, but in his own style which he developed over the years. 

The style of his painting is called Modern Coptic style and as he was a pioneer in this field Fanous is considered the father of modern Coptic icon painting and the initiator of the modern renaissance in [[Coptic art]].&lt;ref name="weekly.ahram.org.eg"/&gt;

Fanous drew all the pictures and icons in [[St. Takla Haymanot's Church (Alexandria)|St. Takla Haymanot's Church]] in [[Alexandria]], which was consecrated in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://st-takla.org/Church-history-1.html |title=History of Saint Takla Himanout's Church |publisher=Official website of St. Takla Haymanot's Church |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1977 and 1978, he spent six months in the UK to paint icons in [http://www.stmark.org.uk St Mark's Coptic Orthodox church] in  Allen Street, [[Kensington]], London.

'''Jean Carbonnier''' (1908–2003) was one of the most important French jurists of the 20th century. He was a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] specialist and a [[private law]] professor.

==Life and career==
Jean Carbonnier was the son of Fernand Carbonnier and Dany Daniel. He married Madeleine Hugues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Encrevé|first=André|title=Les Protestants|year=1993|publisher=Beauchesne|location=Paris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W14H-ZKO9lAC&amp;pg=PA115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His Protestant beliefs influenced his way of thinking and his work. Although Jean Carbonnier published theological and historical articles about [[Protestantism]], he still supported secularity.

Jean Cabonnier studied at the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Bordeaux]] where he obtained his [[doctorate]] in 1932 and private law ''[[agrégation]]'' in 1937.

He was a professor at the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Poitiers]] from 1937 to 1955, teaching French civil law. He became dean in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003)|url=http://expocujas.univ-paris1.fr/Carbonnier/|publisher=Bibliothèque Interuniversitaire Cujas|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, he published his ''Treatise on Civil Law'' (''Droit civil'') in 1955, which has been republished several times since then. Afterwards, Jean Carbonnier taught at the [[Paris Law Faculty]] (replaced with [[Panthéon-Assas University]] in 1970) until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003)|url=http://expocujas.univ-paris1.fr/Carbonnier/|publisher=Bibliothèque Interuniversitaire Cujas|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Carbonnier became President of ''[[L'Année Sociologique]]'' in 1964, and worked for the sociology journal during fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guibentif |first=Pierre |title=Hommage à Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003) |url=http://w3.aislf.univ-tlse2.fr/cr3/cr3__n_JC.htm |date=January 2004 |publisher=AISLF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107051919/http://w3.aislf.univ-tlse2.fr/cr3/cr3__n_JC.htm |archivedate=2013-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created and started heading the Laboratory for Legal Sociology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Research Committee on Sociology of Law|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro_Tribute_Carb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laboratoire de sociologie juridique|url=http://www.u-paris2.fr/52075380/0/fiche___laboratoire/&amp;RH=LABO|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923213253/http://www.u-paris2.fr/52075380/0/fiche___laboratoire/%26RH%3DLABO|archivedate=2009-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (''Laboratoire de sociologie juridique'') at [[Panthéon-Assas University]] in 1968 - in order to produce data that would help law making.

On the international level, Jean Carbonnier supported the creation of the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Research Committee on Sociology of Law|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro_Tribute_Carb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in the inauguration of the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]] in Oñati, with Renato Treves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnaud|first=André-Jean|title=Jean Carbonnier, Renato Treves et la sociologie du droit|year=1995|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|author2=Andrini, Simona}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Carbonnier was particularly well known in Canada and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niort|first=Jean-François|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://www.puf.com/Auteur:Jean_Carbonnier|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|location=Paris|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a professor, he also often referenced to foreign legal systems, such as Germany or Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003)|url=http://expocujas.univ-paris1.fr/Carbonnier/|publisher=Bibliothèque Interuniversitaire Cujas|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his academic career, Jean Carbonnier was also a writer: his book ''Les incertitudes du jeune Saxon. Une autofiction de Jean Carbonnier''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Les incertitudes du jeune Saxon. Une autofiction de Jean Carbonnier|year=2011|publisher=Lexis Nexis|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was published posthumously, in 2011. This fiction shows that Jean Carbonnier was not only a theorist, but also an author of literature. This element can be perceived while reading his theoretical works about law, since he always explained his thoughts with an elegant and precise way of writing. ''Les incertitudes du jeune Saxon'' represents at the same time a fiction (sort of ''[[Bildungsroman]]'') and a reflection about law and history. This work is also linked with the story of his own family and tastes.

==Carbonnier's thought==
Jean Carbonnier's vision of law was based on his own philosophy, which includes [[Protestantism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[skepticism]], and [[empiricism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niort|first=Jean-François|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://www.puf.com/Auteur:Jean_Carbonnier|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|location=Paris|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; – always with open-mindedness. He was at the same time a theorist, an author, and a lawmaker. That is why he was – and still is – often called "''jurislateur''," which can be translated as "''jurislator''" in English.

His works are open to the [[sociology of law]] and the [[philosophy of law]], cleverly linking legal, political, and social sciences. The author observed society in order to understand it. He also considered legal phenomena as social facts. At the same time a jurist and a sociologist, Jean Carbonnier played an important role in adapting law to society's traditions and customs. He considered law as an ''artifact'', and was interested in every system of norms. In ''Flexible droit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Flexible droit - Pour une sociologie du droit sans rigueur|year=2011|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; he explains how law is changeable, uncertain – and "flexible."

=== Law and Sociology===
Jean Carbonnier inspired, constituted, and conceptualized the combination of the study of law with that of sociology ([[legal sociology]]) – at a time when it was not popular among French jurists. He practiced "''sociology without rigor''," as the subtitle of his work ''Flexible droit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Flexible droit - Pour une sociologie du droit sans rigueur|year=2011|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows. Indeed, Jean Carbonnier did not like "rigid" law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frison-Roche|first=Marie-Anne|title=Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003)|journal=L'Année sociologique|year=2003|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-l-annee-sociologique-2003-1-page-289.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since our society is multicultural, law must adapt to its transformations – for instance, concerning family. In ''Sociologie juridique''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Sociologie juridique|year=1978|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France, Collection Quadrige|location=Paris|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (1968), Jean Carbonnier explained his theories about the links between law and society. This work represents his most famous one on the international level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Research Committee on Sociology of Law|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro_Tribute_Carb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially thanks to the concepts he developed, as well as his account of the relationship between jurisprudence and social sciences. 
In ''Flexible droit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Flexible droit - Pour une sociologie du droit sans rigueur|year=2011|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1969), the core study was "''non-law''" ("''non-droit''"), considered as the essence of social life. For Jean Carbonnier, when there is no law, other systems of social regulations will work instead – for instance, religion, morality, customs, friendships, or habits. This part of the book also made Jean Carbonnier an internationally recognized jurist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnaud|first=André-Jean|title=Jean Carbonnier, Renato Treves et la sociologie du droit|year=1995|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|author2=Andrini, Simona}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His last work, ''Droit et passion du droit sous la Vème République'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Droit et passion du droit sous la Vème République|year=2006|publisher=Flammarion|location=Paris|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  also is a legal and sociological work. His study of labor law and contract law represents a good example of legal sociology.

In sum, Jean Carbonnier established at the same time a clear and understandable sociological theory for jurists, as well as a legal theory within the reach of sociologists. This synthesis between law and sociology allowed the usage of sociological methods of investigation, thereby breaking with the "rational" tradition in French legislation. These methods include the [[opinion poll]] ([[IFOP]], then [[INED]]) and [[field research]] in order to measure the "demand for law" expressed by citizens. This allowed notably the establishment of divorce by mutual consent (1975), at a time when divorce by fault was the only form offered to divorcing couples.

===Civil Code and Family law===
Jean Carbonnier renewed the [[French Civil Code]], especially in the domain of [[Family Law]]. He wrote a major ''Treatise on Civil Law'' (''Droit civil''), which is not only a theoretical work, but also shows links with history, sociology, anthropology, and philosophy. The author defined the French Civil Code as the "Civil Constitution of French people," i.e. as part of the national, legal, and political culture in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verdier|first=Raymond|title=Jean Carbonnier : L'homme et l'œuvre|year=2012|publisher=Presses Universitaires de Paris Ouest|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Carbonnier was regarded as an authority on family law and considered family as a legal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Research Committee on Sociology of Law|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro_Tribute_Carb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the inspiration and wrote the pre-projects (''avant-projets'') for ambitious reforms, from 1964 to 1977. These reforms include fields such as incapacity law (1964 and 1968), parental authority (1970), [[filiation]] (1972), and [[divorce]] (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frison-Roche|first=Marie-Anne|title=Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003)|journal=L'Année sociologique|year=2003|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-l-annee-sociologique-2003-1-page-289.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were exposed and explained in ''Essais sur les lois''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Essais sur les lois|year=1995|publisher=Defrenois Ouvrages|location=Paris|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1979).

With Pierre Catala, a French law professor, Jean Carbonnier authored a proposition for the reform of [[inheritance law]]. It was taken up by the legislature in its law of 3 December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loi no 2001-1135 du 3 décembre 2001 relative aux droits du conjoint survivant et des enfants adultérins et modernisant diverses dispositions de droit successoral|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000582185&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;  French inheritance law was thereby adapted to the aspirations of the modern family.

===Passion and Inflation of the Law===
Through his critical mind and his convincing rhetoric, Jean Carbonnier used the term "passion" in the title of his book ''Droit et passion du droit sous la Vème République'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Droit et passion du droit sous la Vème République|year=2006|publisher=Flammarion|location=Paris|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind it would be that producing too many laws tend to be harmful and dangerous. This refers to the tendency, in France, to legislate too much, leading to an "inflation" of the law. This excess is meant to limit arbitrary powers. Moreover, it is a consequence of decentralization and the importance of community law. Sociologically, with the growing power of the media, lawmakers must react constantly, which result in an increasing production of laws. For instance, some are used as tools for political and electoral communication. Law therefore becomes "educational" (''pédagogique'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Flexible droit - Pour une sociologie du droit sans rigueur|year=2011|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This passion is dangerous, or even destructive. Indeed, the more laws there are, the less likely it is possible to apply them effectively. In particular, inflation leads to misunderstanding or ignorance from citizens – and sometimes even from judges. This results in a lack of substance and credibility. The inflation therefore implies uncertainty (or insecurity). Jean Carbonnier's theories are still topical: for instance, in 2006, the [[French Council of State]] (''Conseil d'Etat'') criticized the excesses that could threaten social cohesion in its annual report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conseil d'Etat |title=Sécurité juridique et complexité du droit - Rapport public 2006 |url=http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/rapports-et-etudes/rapport-public-2006.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522173532/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/rapports-et-etudes/rapport-public-2006.html |archivedate=2013-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  about [[legal certainty]] (''Sécurité juridique et complexité du droit'').

===Subjectivisation of the Law===
Another evolution described by Jean Carbonnier is the subjectivisation of the law. This refers to the fact that the "rights to..." (''droits à...'') become more and more important. The author speaks in terms of a "pulverisation in subjective rights" (''pulvérisation en droits subjectifs''). Subjective rights (or [[entitlements]]) are replacing legal principles. This subjectivisation of the legal system reconstructs it, focusing on [[fundamental rights]] (substantial notion), instead of the law itself (institutional notion).

Therefore, law considers each individual (fundamental rights), rather than society as a whole. The legislation becomes more particular and precise. As a consequence, there is an inversion of the role and status of lawmakers in France: they are more and more concrete, whereas judges become more abstract. This results in individualization, which is a source of the inflation.

'''Jérôme Lefèvre''' is an independent art curator and art critic.

In the late 1990s Lefèvre curated a series of cinema programs with films by [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Marie Menken]], [[Tony Conrad]], [[Robert Whitaker (photographer)|Robert Whitaker]], [[Richard Kern]] and Henry Hills. At the same time he curated the exhibition "Sound Games" &lt;ref&gt;(Centre Noroit, Arras, France)&lt;/ref&gt; with artists [[Frédéric Le Junter]], [[Pierre Bastien]] and Arnaud Labelle-Rojoux as well as contemporary music composers. 
In 2004, Lefèvre co-organized "Meanwhile in the real world" at the Sorbonne Chapell where he curated works by [[Franz West]], [[Olaf Breuning]], [[Jean-Michel Othoniel]], Fabrice Gygi and Alex McQuilkin. 
He curated two successive exhibitions at the Palais d'Iéna in Paris : "Pearls Of The North" (with artists [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Atelier Van Lieshout]], Joris van de Moortel, Kelly Schacht, The Plug, Anne Wenzel and Scarlett Hooft Graafland) and "Unlimited Bodies" (with [[Marnie Weber]], [[Tony Oursler]], [[Steven Claydon]], Don Brown, Edward Lipski, Stephan Balkenhol, Damien Deroubaix as well as [[Lucy+Jorge Orta]].

== Contemporary art and heavy metal ==

Lefèvre's work as a curator and a writer focuses on the links between contemporary art and music cultures.  A [[grindcore]] musician himself, he is particularly interested in the imbrications between contemporary art and heavy metal music and culture.

He founded [[C.S. (Conservative Shithead) Journal]] with artist [[Damien Deroubaix]] ([[Marcel Duchamp Prize]] 2009 nominee). C.S. Journal is a monographic publication each time dedicated to a visual artist in regards with its musical references in extreme metal music. The first C.S. Journal issue (with Damien Deroubaix) sorted out for the FIAC, Contemporary Art Fair in Paris in 2009 and contained contributions by legendary [[Mick Harris]] ([[Napalm Death]], Scorn) and [[Jeffrey Walker]] (Carcass).
The second issue  had been conceived by artist Elodie Lesourd and feature contributions by [[Fenriz]] ([[Darkthrone]]) and Hunter Hunt-Hendrix (Liturgy). The third issue is the work of [[Steven Shearer]] with Dieter Roelstraete (MCA Chicago) and Marky Marquis (Coroner) had been published for the 54th [[Venice Biennale]] where Steven Shearer represented Canada.

Lefèvre regularly contributes to magazines and books on the topic. He is the author of an essay on this generation of artists in the book "Black-Metal : Beyond the Darkness" together with Nick Richardson and Brandon Stosuy.

He also exhibited in 2009 the work of photographer [[Seldon Hunt]] (artist and author of art covers for [[Sunn O)))]], [[Earth (American band)]] and [[The Melvins]]) at Galerie du Jour - agnès b. in Paris.

This is a list of '''''Whaling Walls''''', which are large outdoor [[mural]]s by the artist [[Robert Wyland]], featuring images of life-size [[gray whale]]s, breaching [[humpback whale]]s, [[blue whale]]s, and other sea life. ''Whaling Walls'' (a pun on the [[Wailing Wall]]) are created by invitation of the communities, institutions, and building owners of the structures on which they are painted. The one hundredth and possibly final ''Whaling Wall'' was painted in [[Beijing]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[Environment News Service|ENS]] (27 June 2008).

'''Literary nonsense''' (or '''nonsense literature''') is a broad categorization of [[literature]] that balances elements that make sense with some that do not, with the effect of subverting language conventions or logical reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though the most well-known form of literary nonsense is [[nonsense verse]], the genre is present in many forms of literature.

The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it. Its humor is derived from its nonsensical nature, rather than wit or the "joke" of a punchline.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, ''Anatomy'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Jabberwocky creatures.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[John Tenniel]]'s depiction of the nonsense creatures in [[Lewis Carroll|Carroll]]'s ''[[Jabberwocky]]''.]]

Literary nonsense, as recognized since the nineteenth century, comes from a combination of two broad artistic sources. The first and older source is the oral folk tradition, including games, songs, dramas, and rhymes, such as the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, ''Boshen'', pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; The literary figure [[Mother Goose]] represents common incarnations of this style of writing.

The second, newer source of literary nonsense is in the intellectual absurdities of [[court poet]]s, scholars, and intellectuals of various kinds. These writers often created sophisticated nonsense forms of Latin parodies, religious [[Travesti (theatre)|travesties]], and political satire, though these texts are distinguished from more pure satire and parody by their exaggerated nonsensical effects.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's literary nonsense comes from a combination of both sources.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not the first to write this hybrid kind of nonsense, [[Edward Lear]] developed and popularized it in his many [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s (starting with ''[[A Book of Nonsense]]'', 1846) and other famous texts such as ''The Owl and the Pussycat'', ''The Dong with a Luminous Nose,'' ''[[s:The Jumblies|The Jumblies]]'' and ''The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Around the World''. [[Lewis Carroll]] continued this trend, making literary nonsense a worldwide phenomenon with ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1871). Carroll's poem "[[Jabberwocky]]", which appears in the latter book, is often considered quintessential nonsense literature.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory==

In literary nonsense, certain formal elements of language and logic that facilitate meaning are balanced by elements that negate meaning. These formal elements include semantics, syntax, phonetics, context, representation, and formal diction.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre is most easily recognizable by the various techniques or devices it uses to create this balance of meaning and lack of meaning, such as faulty cause and effect, [[portmanteau]], [[neologism]], reversals and inversions, imprecision (including gibberish), simultaneity, picture/text incongruity, arbitrariness, infinite repetition, negativity or mirroring, and misappropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, ''Anatomy'', pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonsense tautology, reduplication, and absurd precision have also been used in the nonsense genre.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, Naissance, pp. xxvi–xxix&lt;/ref&gt; For a text to be within the genre of literary nonsense, it must have an abundance of nonsense techniques woven into the fabric of the piece. If the text employs only occasional nonsense devices, then it may not be classified as literary nonsense, though there may be a nonsensical effect to certain portions of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Lecercle, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', for instance, employs the nonsense device of imprecision by including a blank page, but this is only one nonsense device in a novel that otherwise makes sense.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In Flann O'Brien's ''The Third Policeman'', on the other hand, many of the devices of nonsense are present throughout, and thus it could be considered a nonsense novel.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 85, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction==

Gibberish, light verse, fantasy, and jokes and riddles are sometimes mistaken for literary nonsense, and the confusion is greater because nonsense can sometimes inhabit these (and many other) forms and genres.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, Shortsleeve, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure gibberish, as in the "hey diddle diddle" of nursery rhyme, is a device of nonsense, but it does not make a text, overall, literary nonsense. If there is not significant sense to balance out such devices, then the text dissolves into literal (as opposed to literary) nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Light verse, which is generally speaking humorous verse meant to entertain, may share humor, inconsequentiality, and playfulness, with nonsense, but it usually has a clear point or joke, and does not have the requisite tension between meaning and lack of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense is distinct from [[fantasy]], though there are sometimes resemblances between them. While nonsense may employ the strange creatures, other worldly situations, magic, and talking animals of fantasy, these supernatural phenomena are not nonsensical if they have a discernible logic supporting their existence. The distinction lies in the coherent and unified nature of fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Everything follows logic within the rules of the fantasy world; the nonsense world, on the other hand, has no comprehensive system of logic, although it may imply the existence of an inscrutable one, just beyond our grasp.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, pp. 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of magic within an imaginary world is an example of this distinction. Fantasy worlds employ the presence of magic to logically explain the impossible. In nonsense literature, magic is rare but when it does occur, its nonsensical nature only adds to the mystery rather than logically explaining anything. An example of nonsensical magic occurs in Carl Sandburg's ''[[Rootabaga Stories]]'', when Jason Squiff, in possession of a magical "gold buckskin whincher", has his hat, mittens, and shoes turn into popcorn because, according to the "rules" of the magic, "You have a letter Q in your name and because you have the pleasure and happiness of having a Q in your name you must have a popcorn hat, popcorn mittens and popcorn shoes".&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Riddles]] only appear to be nonsense until the answer is found. The most famous nonsense riddle is only so because it originally had no answer.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, ''Anatomy'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In Carroll's ''Alice in Wonderland'', the Mad Hatter asks Alice "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?" When Alice gives up, the Hatter replies that he does not know either, creating a nonsensical riddle.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Some seemingly nonsense texts are actually riddles, such as the popular 1940s song ''[[Mairzy Doats]]'', which at first appears to have little discernible meaning but has a discoverable message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dennislivingston.com/jl_mairzy.htm|title=Cabaret and Jazz Songs by Dennis Livingston|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes are not nonsense because their humor comes from their making sense, from our "getting" it, while nonsense is funny because it does ''not'' make sense, we do not "get" it.&lt;ref&gt;Tigges, "Anatomy," p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audience ==

While most contemporary nonsense has been written for children, the form has an extensive history in adult configurations before the nineteenth century. Figures such as John Hoskyns, Henry Peacham, [[John Sandford (poet)|John Sandford]], and [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor]] lived in the early seventeenth century and were noted nonsense authors in their time.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonsense was also an important element in the works of [[Flann O'Brien]] and [[Eugène Ionesco]]. Literary nonsense, as opposed to the folk forms of nonsense that have always existed in written history, was only first written for children in the early nineteenth century. It was popularized by [[Edward Lear]] and then later by [[Lewis Carroll]]. Today literary nonsense enjoys a shared audience of adults and children.

== Nonsense writers ==
'''''Note''': None of these writers are considered ''exclusively'' a "nonsense writer." Some of them wrote texts considered to be in the genre (as in Lear, Carroll, Gorey, Lennon, Sandburg), while others only use nonsense as an occasional device (as in Joyce, Juster). All of these writers wrote outside of the nonsense genre also.''&lt;ref&gt;Noakes, Vivien, Edward Lear, The Life of a Wanderer, Sutton.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
[[Bob Dylan]] wrote some lyrics that contain nonsense techniques, especially around the mid-1960s, in songs like "Bob Dylan's 115th Dream" and "Tombstone Blues".&lt;ref&gt;Tarantula, Scribner (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]], frontman of the [[art rock]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] group [[Talking Heads]], employed nonsensical techniques in songwriting. Byrne often combined coherent yet unrelated phrases to make up nonsensical lyrics in songs such as: "[[Burning Down the House]]", "Making Flippy Floppy" and "Girlfriend Is Better".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catharsis.tumblr.com/post/465840647/david-byrne-on-musical-collaborations |title=desideratum &amp;#124; David Byrne on reevaluating ideas and finding |publisher=Catharsis.tumblr.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency formed the basis of the title for the Talking Heads concert movie, ''[[Stop Making Sense]]''. More recently, Byrne published ''Arboretum'' (2006), a volume of tree-like diagrams that are, "mental maps of imaginary territory".  He continues, explaining the aspect of nonsense: "Irrational logic – [...]. The application of logical scientific rigor and form to basically irrational premises. To proceed, carefully and deliberately, from nonsense, with a straight face, often arriving at a new kind of sense."&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, ''Why?'' in Arboretum, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Syd Barrett]], one-time frontman and founder of [[Pink Floyd]], was known for his often nonsensical songwriting influenced by Lear and Carroll that featured heavily on Pink Floyd's first album, ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/25/syd-barrett-irregular-head-review|title=Syd Barrett: A Very Irregular Head by Rob Chapman|accessdate=24 April 2010 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sean | last=O'Hagan | date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glen Baxter (cartoonist)|Glen Baxter]]'s [[comic]] work is often nonsense, relying on the baffling interplay between word and image.&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, pp. 189–195&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Zippy the Pinhead]]'', by [[Bill Griffith]], is an American strip that mixes philosophy, including what has been called "Heideggerian disruptions"&lt;ref&gt;Grabiner, July/Aug, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and pop culture in its nonsensical processes.&lt;ref&gt;Lecercle, p. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26077">In music, a '''''method''''' is a kind of [[textbook]] for a specified [[musical instrument]] or a selected problem of playing a certain instrument.

A ''method'' usually contains [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] charts or [[tablature]]s, etc., [[musical scale|scales]] and numerous different [[exercise]]s, sometimes also simple [[etude]]s, in different [[key (music)|key]]s, in ascending order as to difficulty (= in methodical ''progression'') or with a focus on isolated aspects like fluency, [[rhythm]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[articulation (music)|articulation]] and the like. Sometimes there are even [[recital]] pieces, also with accompaniment. Such methods differ from etude books in that they are meant as a linear course for a student to follow, with consistent guidance, whereas volumes of etudes are not as comprehensive.

As typical instrumental methods are meant to function as textbooks supporting an instrumental teacher (rather than to facilitate self-teaching), usually no basic or special playing techniques are covered in any depth. Detailed instructions in this respect are only found in special, [[Autodidacticism|autodidactical]] methods.

Some methods are especially tailored for students on certain [[skill]] levels or [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]]. In contrast, a 'complete' method (sometimes in multiple volumes) is meant to accompany the student until he or she becomes an advanced player.

Methods of certain authors or editors have achieved the status of standard works (reflecting regional and cultural differences) and are published or reissued by different [[publishing]] companies and in divers (new) [[arrangement]]s. The [[Suzuki Method]] is probably the most well known example of this.

The following is a list of various methods of historical interest.

The '''Miller theorem''' refers to the process of creating [[equivalent circuit]]s. It asserts that a floating impedance element, supplied by two voltage sources connected in series, may be split into two grounded elements with corresponding impedances. There is also a [[#Dual Miller theorem (for currents)|dual Miller theorem]] with regards to impedance supplied by two current sources connected in parallel. The two versions are based on the two [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]].

Miller theorems are not only pure mathematical expressions. These arrangements explain important circuit phenomena about modifying impedance ([[Miller effect]], [[virtual ground]], [[Bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]], [[negative impedance]], etc.) and help in designing and understanding various commonplace circuits (feedback amplifiers, resistive and time-dependent converters, negative impedance converters, etc.). The theorems are useful in 'circuit analysis' especially for analyzing circuits with feedback&lt;ref name="netlecturer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netlecturer.com/NTOnLine/T08_THEOREMS/p06MiscTheorems.htm#G7 |title=Miscellaneous network theorems |publisher=Netlecturer.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321134013/http://www.netlecturer.com/NTOnLine/T08_THEOREMS/p06MiscTheorems.htm#G7 |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and certain transistor amplifiers at high frequencies.&lt;ref name = "sandiego"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.sandiego.edu/~ekim/e194rfs01/millers.pdf |title=EEE 194RF: Miller's theorem |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a close relationship between Miller theorem and Miller effect: the theorem may be considered as a generalization of the effect and the effect may be thought as of a special case of the theorem.

== Miller theorem (for voltages) ==

=== Definition ===

The Miller theorem establishes that in a linear circuit, if there exists a branch with impedance ''Z'', connecting two nodes with nodal voltages ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', we can replace this branch by two branches connecting the corresponding nodes to ground by impedances respectively Z/(1 &amp;minus; K) and KZ/(K &amp;minus; 1), where K = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The Miller theorem may be proved by using the equivalent two-port network technique to replace the two-port to its equivalent and by applying the source absorption theorem.&lt;ref name = "paginas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~fff/eBook/MDA/Teo_Miller.html |title=Miller's theorem |publisher=Paginas.fe.up.pt |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the Miller theorem is based on [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]]; for that reason, it is named also ''Miller theorem for voltages''.

=== Explanation ===
[[File:Miller's theorem schematic.jpg|thumb|A schematic over Miller's theorem]]

Miller theorem implies that an impedance element is supplied by two arbitrary (not necessarily dependent) voltage sources that are connected in series through the common ground. In practice, one of them acts as a main (independent) voltage source with voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the other – as an additional (linearly dependent) voltage source with voltage &lt;math&gt;V_2 = K{V_1}&lt;/math&gt;. The idea of Miller theorem (modifying circuit impedances seen from the sides of the input and output sources) is revealed below by comparing the two situations – without and with connecting an additional voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

If ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' was zero (there was not a second voltage source or the right end of the element with impedance ''Z'' was just grounded), the input current flowing through the element would be determined, according to Ohm's law, only by ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''

:&lt;math&gt;I_{in0} = \frac{V_1}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

and the input impedance of the circuit would be

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{in0} = \frac{V_1}{I_{in0}} = Z.&lt;/math&gt;

As a second voltage source is included, the input current depends on both the voltages. According to its polarity, ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is subtracted from or added to ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''; so, the input current decreases/increases

:&lt;math&gt;I_{in} = \frac{V_1 - V_2}{Z} = \frac{(1 - K)}{Z}{V_1} = {(1 - K)}{I_{in0}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the input impedance of the circuit seen from the side of the input source accordingly increases/decreases

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{in} = \frac{V_1}{I_{in}} = \frac{Z}{1-K}.&lt;/math&gt;

So, Miller theorem expresses the fact that '''''connecting a second voltage source with proportional voltage &lt;math&gt;V_2 = K{V_1}&lt;/math&gt; in series with the input voltage source changes the effective voltage, the current and respectively, the circuit impedance seen from the side of the input source'''''. Depending on the polarity, ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' acts as a supplemental voltage source helping or opposing the main voltage source to pass the current through the impedance.

Besides by presenting the combination of the two voltage sources as a new composed voltage source, the theorem may be explained by ''combining the actual element and the second voltage source into a new virtual element with dynamically modified impedance''. From this viewpoint, ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an additional voltage that artificially increases/decreases the voltage drop ''V&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' across the impedance ''Z'' thus decreasing/increasing the current. The proportion between the voltages determines the value of the obtained impedance (see the tables below) and gives in total six groups of typical [[#Applications|applications]].

The circuit impedance, seen from the side of the output source, may be defined similarly, if the voltages ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are swapped and the coefficient ''K'' is replaced by 1/''K''

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{in2} = \frac{{K}{Z}}{K-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Implementation ===

[[Image:Miller cir.png|right|frame|A typical implementation of Miller theorem based on a single-ended voltage amplifier]]

Most frequently, the Miller theorem may be observed in, and implemented by, an arrangement consisting of an element with impedance ''Z'' connected between the two terminals of a grounded general linear network.&lt;ref name="sandiego"/&gt; Usually, a voltage amplifier with gain of &lt;math&gt;A_V = K&lt;/math&gt; serves as such a linear network, but also other devices can play this role: a man and a [[potentiometer]] in a [[Potentiometer (measuring instrument)#Constant current potentiometer|potentiometric null-balance meter]], an electromechanical integrator (servomechanisms using potentiometric feedback sensors), etc.

In the amplifier implementation, the input voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' serves as ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the output voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' – as ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. In many cases, the input voltage source has some internal impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_{int}&lt;/math&gt; or an additional input impedance is connected that, in combination with ''Z'', introduces a feedback. Depending on the kind of amplifier (non-inverting, inverting or differential), the feedback can be positive, negative or mixed.

The Miller amplifier arrangement has two aspects:
*the amplifier may be thought as an additional voltage source converting the actual impedance into a ''virtual impedance'' (the amplifier modifies the impedance of the actual element)
* the virtual impedance may be thought as an element connected in parallel to the amplifier input (the virtual impedance modifies the amplifier input impedance).

=== Applications ===

The introduction of an impedance that connects amplifier input and output ports adds a great
deal of complexity in the analysis process. Miller theorem helps reduce the
complexity in some circuits particularly with feedback&lt;ref name = "sandiego" /&gt; by converting them to simpler equivalent circuits. But Miller theorem is not only an effective tool for creating equivalent circuits; it is also a powerful tool for designing and understanding circuits based on ''modifying impedance by additional voltage''. Depending on the polarity of the output voltage versus the input voltage and the proportion between their magnitudes, there are six groups of typical situations. In some of them, the Miller phenomenon appears as desired ([[Bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]]) or undesired ([[Miller effect]]) unintentional effects; in other cases it is intentionally introduced.

==== Applications based on subtracting ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' from ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' ====

In these applications, the output voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is inserted with an opposite polarity in respect to the input voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' travelling along the loop (but in respect to ground, the polarities are the same). As a result, the effective voltage across, and the current through, the impedance decrease; the input impedance increases.

{{anchor|increased}}'''Increased impedance''' is implemented by a non-inverting amplifier with gain of 0 &lt; A&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1. The (magnitude of) output voltage is less than the input voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and partially neutralizes it. Examples are imperfect voltage followers ([[Emitter follower|emitter]], [[Source follower|source]], [[Cathode follower|cathode]] follower, etc.) and amplifiers with series negative feedback ([[Common emitter#Emitter degeneration|emitter degeneration]]), whose input impedance is moderately increased.

[[Image:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|right|frame|The op-amp non-inverting amplifier is a typical circuit with series negative feedback based on the Miller theorem, where the op-amp differential input impedance is apparently increased up to infinity]]

{{anchor|infinite}}'''Infinite impedance''' uses a non-inverting amplifier with A&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. The output voltage is equal to the input voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and completely neutralizes it. Examples are [[Potentiometer (measuring instrument)#Constant current potentiometer|potentiometric null-balance meters]] and op-amp followers and amplifiers with series negative feedback ([[Voltage buffer|op-amp follower]] and [[Operational amplifier applications#Non-inverting amplifier|non-inverting amplifier]]) where the circuit input impedance is enormously increased. This technique is referred to as [[Bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]] and is intentionally used in biasing circuits, input guarding circuits,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.national.com/an/AN/AN-241.pdf Working with High Impedance Op Amps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923043325/http://www.national.com/an/AN/AN-241.pdf |date=2010-09-23 }} AN-241&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

{{anchor|negative current inversion}}'''Negative impedance obtained by current inversion''' is implemented by a non-inverting amplifier with A&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1. The current changes its direction, as the output voltage is higher than the input voltage. If the input voltage source has some internal impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_{int}&lt;/math&gt; or if it is connected through another impedance element, a positive feedback appears. A typical application is the [[Negative impedance converter|negative impedance converter with current inversion]] (INIC) that uses both negative and positive feedback (the negative feedback is used to realize a non-inverting amplifier and the positive feedback – to modify the impedance).

==== Applications based on adding ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' ====

In these applications, the output voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is inserted with the same polarity  in respect to the input voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' travelling along the loop (but in respect to ground, the polarities are opposite). As a result, the effective voltage across and the current through the impedance increase; the input impedance decreases.

{{anchor|decreased}}'''Decreased impedance''' is implemented by an inverting amplifier having some moderate gain, usually 10 &lt; A&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1000. It may be observed as an undesired [[Miller effect]] in [[common-emitter]], [[common-source]] and ''common-cathode'' amplifying stages where effective input capacitance is increased. [[Frequency compensation#Dominant-pole compensation|Frequency compensation]] for general purpose operational amplifiers and [https://books.google.com/books?id=mfec2Zw_b7wC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=%22transistor+Miller+integrator+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-8PdcUw4LD&amp;sig=zOjnF9O-oUBjw0bU9a_SMYdgCYY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C7yMTIDjGM7Oswb3oLy7Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22transistor%20Miller%20integrator%20%22&amp;f=false transistor Miller integrator] are examples of useful usage of the Miller effect.

[[Image:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|right|frame|The op-amp inverting amplifier is a typical circuit, with parallel negative feedback, based on the Miller theorem, where the op-amp differential input impedance is apparently decreased up to zero]]

{{anchor|zeroed}}'''Zeroed impedance''' uses an inverting (usually op-amp) amplifier with enormously high gain A&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; → ∞. The output voltage is almost equal to the voltage drop ''V&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;'' across the impedance and completely neutralizes it. The circuit behaves as a short connection and a [[virtual ground]] appears at the input; so, it should not be driven by a constant voltage source. For this purpose, some circuits are driven by a constant current source or by a real voltage source with internal impedance: [[current-to-voltage converter]] (transimpedance amplifier), capacitive integrator (named also [[current integrator]] or [[charge amplifier]]), resistance-to-voltage converter (a resistive sensor connected in the place of the impedance ''Z'').

The rest of them have additional impedance connected in series to the input: [[voltage-to-current converter]] (transconductance amplifier), [[inverting amplifier]], [[summing amplifier]], inductive integrator, capacitive differentiator, [[Operational amplifier applications#Inverting integrator|resistive-capacitive integrator]], [[Operational amplifier applications#Inverting differentiator|capacitive-resistive differentiator]], inductive-resistive differentiator, etc. The inverting integrators from this list are examples of useful and desired applications of the Miller effect in its extreme manifestation.

In all these ''op-amp inverting circuits with parallel negative feedback'', the input current is increased to its maximum. It is determined only by the input voltage and the input impedance according to [[Ohm's law]]; it does not depend on the impedance ''Z''.

{{anchor|negative with voltage inversion}}'''Negative impedance with voltage inversion''' is implemented by applying both negative and positive feedback to an op-amp amplifier with a differential input. The input voltage source has to have internal impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_{int}&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0 or it has to be connected through another impedance element to the input. Under these conditions, the input voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the circuit changes its polarity as the output voltage exceeds the voltage drop ''V&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;'' across the impedance (''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''  = ''V&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; 0).

A typical application is a negative impedance converter with voltage inversion (VNIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonlinear.eecs.berkeley.edu/chaos/introduction_nonlinear_circuit_analysis.pdf|title=Nonlinear Circuit Analysis – An Introduction|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is interesting that the circuit input voltage has the same polarity as the output voltage, although it is applied to the inverting op-amp input; the input source has an opposite polarity to both the circuit input and output voltages.

=== Generalization of Miller arrangement ===

The original Miller effect is implemented by capacitive impedance connected between the two nodes. Miller theorem generalizes Miller effect as it implies arbitrary impedance Z connected between the nodes. It is supposed also a constant coefficient K; then the expressions [[#Explanation|above]] are valid. But modifying properties of Miller theorem exist even when these requirements are violated and this arrangement can be generalized further by dynamizing the impedance and the coefficient.

'''Non-linear element.''' Besides impedance, Miller arrangement can modify the IV characteristic of an arbitrary element. The circuit of a [[Operational amplifier applications#Logarithmic output|diode log converter]] is an example of a non-linear [[#zeroed|virtually zeroed resistance]] where the logarithmic [[diode#Current–voltage characteristic|forward IV curve of a diode]] is transformed to a vertical straight line overlapping the Y axis.
 
'''Not constant coefficient.''' If the coefficient K varies, some exotic virtual elements can be obtained. A [[Gyrator#Application: a simulated inductor|gyrator circuit]] is an example of such a virtual element where the resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is modified so that to mimic inductance, capacitance or inversed resistance.

== Dual Miller theorem (for currents) ==

=== Definition ===
There is also a dual version of Miller theorem that is based on [[Kirchhoff's current law]] (''Miller theorem for currents''): if there is a branch in a circuit with impedance Z connecting a node, where two currents I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; converge to ground, we can replace this branch by two conducting the referred currents, with imperespectively equal to (1 + α)Z and (1 + α)Z/α, where α = I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The dual theorem may be proved by replacing the two-port network by its equivalent and by applying the source absorption theorem.&lt;ref name = "paginas" /&gt;

=== Explanation ===
Dual Miller theorem actually expresses the fact that connecting a second current source producing proportional current &lt;math&gt;I_2 = K{I_1}&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with the main input source and the impedance element changes the current flowing through it, the voltage and accordingly, the circuit impedance seen from the side of the input source. Depending on the direction, ''I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' acts as a supplemental current source helping or opposing the main current source ''I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to create voltage across the impedance. The combination of the actual element and the second current source may be thought as of a new virtual element with dynamically modified impedance.

=== Implementation ===
Dual Miller theorem is usually implemented by an arrangement consisting of two voltage sources supplying the grounded impedance ''Z'' through floating impedances (see [http://www.maxim-ic.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/1155 Fig. 3]). The combinations of the voltage sources and belonging impedances form the two current sources – the main and the auxiliary one. As in the case of the main Miller theorem, the second voltage is usually produced by a voltage amplifier. Depending on the kind of the amplifier (inverting, non-inverting or differential) and the gain, the circuit input impedance may be virtually increased, infinite, decreased, zero or negative.

=== Applications ===
As the main Miller theorem, besides helping circuit analysis process, the dual version is a powerful tool for designing and understanding circuits based on modifying impedance by additional current. Typical applications are some exotic circuits with negative impedance as load cancellers,&lt;ref name="load canceller"&gt;[http://electronicdesign.com/power/negative-resistance-load-canceller-helps-drive-heavy-loads Negative-resistance load canceller helps drive heavy loads]&lt;/ref&gt; capacitance neutralizers,&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation |url=http://www.philbrickarchive.org/1964-1_v12_no1_the_lightning_empiricist.htm |title=Impedance and admittance transformations using operational amplifiers |author=D.

The input voltage source and the resistor R constitute an imperfect current source passing current ''I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' through the load (see Fig. 3 in the source). The INIC acts as a second current source passing "helping" current ''I&lt;sub&gt;−R&lt;/sub&gt;'' through the load. As a result, the total current flowing through the load is constant and the circuit impedance seen by the input source is increased. As a comparison, in a [http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&amp;ArticleID=4128 load canceller]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, the INIC passes all the required current through the load; the circuit impedance seen from the side of the input source (the load impedance) is almost infinite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10274">'''Modified Stave Notation (MSN)''' is an alternative way of notating music that was developed in the [[UK]] where it is widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnib.org.uk/livingwithsightloss/leisureculture/music/readingmusic/Pages/modstave.aspx Modified Stave Notation - RNIB]&lt;/ref&gt; MSN is intended to be used by people who cannot easily read ordinary musical [[Staff (music)|stave notation]] (or staff notation&lt;ref&gt;''Staff'' is more common in [[American English]], ''stave'' in [[British English]]. The plural is ''staves'' in either case; ''stave'' is, in fact, a [[back-formation]] from ''staves''. (Pam Peters, The Cambridge Guide to English Usage, p. 514.)&lt;/ref&gt;), even if it is enlarged, or for some people reduced in size. Such users include those with [[visual impairment]]s and those who are [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]].

== History of Modified Stave Notation ==

In the 1990s the then [[Royal National Institute of Blind People|Royal National Institute for the Blind]], negotiated with the [[Music Publishers Association (UK)|Music Publishers' Association]] an agreement to permit partially sighted people to enlarge music, providing only one copy was made and the enlarged music was not re-sold. For each item enlarged, permission was needed from the work's publisher who would then supply a yellow sticker with "MPA approved '''large print''' music copy RNIB" written over a five line stave. It was noted, however, at this time that enlargement produced new problems, notably with the extra space between symbols and the production of either unwieldy large and flimsy [[Sheet music|sheets]] or scores requiring more page turns and not necessarily in convenient places. So examples of music in which all signs equally enlarged but compacted horizontally were created.&lt;ref&gt;Ockelford, A. (1994) "Music in large print" Royal National Institute for the Blind and The Music Publishers' Association Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1990s some music publishers started producing music in [[Large-print|large print]] fonts, taking layouts used widely for children's beginner tutor books and extending these to short [[Musical repertoire|repertoire pieces]], particularly for [[keyboard instrument]]s. The National Music and Disability Information Service&lt;ref&gt;National Music and Disability Information Service 1982 to 1998, based at Dartington Hall. This service was then taken under the umbrella of Soundsense, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. [http://www.soundsense.org/ Sound sense]&lt;/ref&gt; kept a resource paper "RP14 Information on Music for People with Partial Sight" which listed some of these publishers.

With the advent of sophisticated [[Scorewriter|music notation software]], such as MuseScore,&lt;ref&gt;[https://musescore.org/en/tutorials/modified-stave-notation musescore.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the production of MSN became easier, with the ability to save preferred settings of each user. The Royal National Institute of Blind People is the largest formal producer of MSN in the world, with a production team based in [[Ivybridge]], [[Devon]]. MSN has become an accepted standard for public examinations in England and Wales, for [[GCSE]] and [[A level]] music and music technology papers, under general special arrangements authorised by the [[Joint Council for Qualifications]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcq.org.uk/ Joint Council for Qualifications]&lt;/ref&gt; and worldwide for sight reading tests for grade examination boards such as the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gb.abrsm.org/en/exam-booking/special-needs/guidelines-for-candidates-with-dyslexia-dyspraxia-or-other-learning-difficulties/ Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Trinity College London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinitycollege.co.uk/site/?id=1315 Trinity College London]&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates requiring Modified Print copies of the [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] may ask for MSN scores, sometimes in a standard format, sometimes tailor made to match a submitted example.

== Standards for Modified Stave Notation ==

Formalising standards for MSN in the UK involved:
* discussion amongst producers 
* experiments with users and
* examination with software producers of the variables within packages. 
The work was underpinned by links with [[RNIB| RNIB's]] general print guidelines for making information accessible for blind and partially sighted people, "See it Right".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnib.org.uk/professionals/accessibleinformation/pages/see_it_right.aspx See It Right - RNIB]&lt;/ref&gt; Reading music notation is more complex than reading prose involving complex [[Eye movement in music reading|eye movements]]. Not only are there many symbols of different shapes and sizes, but the signs are placed in [[vertical direction|vertical]] as well as [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] dimensions, some having effect for lines of music whilst others just apply to single features. Often the reader needs to read "in time" rather than at his or her own speed, alongside the execution of complex physical skills to render the symbols into sound via an [[musical instrument|instrument]]. Usually music is placed further away than ordinary print, allowing for an instrument to be placed between player and the printed music. There may also be the need to see a [[musical director]] in the middle distance. With [[E-book reader|eReading devices]] it is easy to obtain ordinary print consistently in one's preferred font size and type face. However, stave notation comes in all kinds of densities, type faces and relative symbols size. Modified Stave Notation can enable users to have consistent size and layout.

== Guidelines for Modified Stave Notation ==

Guidelines for the production of Modified Stave Notation are published by the UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukaaf.org UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF)]&lt;/ref&gt;  in document "G009 UKAAF Modified Stave Notation meeting individual needs for large print music".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukaaf.org/members-area/guidance-documents/#G009 G009 UKAAF Modified Stave Notation meeting individual needs for large print music]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamentals of producing Modified Stave Notation are: 
* clear printing of symbols with no overlapping of different signs
* evening out the symbol size and density
* reducing redundant space
* placing symbols used around the stave at a consistent distance from the lines and the notes to which they refer (so once one is located, the reader can reasonably expect to find them in the same place later in the piece), and, 
* describe in words in a preface the location of sporadic or unusual symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, S-A. (2004) "Modified Stave Notation - An Approach to Making Stave Notation More Accessible to Users Who Are Partially Sighted" in K.Miesenberger et al. [Eds.] ICCHP 2004, LNCS 3118, pp. 236-239 Springer-Verlag: Berlin and Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other factors assisting accessibility ==

In addition to the alteration of stave notation layout in MSN, other factors affecting [[accessibility]] include binding, colour of background paper (as stave notation is conventionally in black ink) and lighting. The use of multimedia can also increase accessibility. For example, the music seen can also be heard electronically with a variety of levels of "interpretation" from just the pitch and note lengths, to full nuance and stylistic detail. Lastly, analysis and development of reading and memorisation techniques, pertinent to the user's requirements, may aid fluency.

== General principles of clear print used in Modified Stave Notation ==

Some principles from RNIB's guidelines 'See It Right' are transferred directly to stave notation in MSN. The staves and note stem thickness correspond to a thickness of letters in 16 [[Point (typography)|point]] typefaces. Spaces between systems&lt;ref&gt;The distance between the sets of music lines (2 for piano music, usually, or 3 for voice and piano, for example)&lt;/ref&gt; and between staves within a system are sufficiently large, although more use is made of left and right margins. Text is [[sans-serif|sans serif]],&lt;ref&gt;That is, without the "curly" edges to letters common in fonts such as Times New Roman&lt;/ref&gt; semi-bold or bold.

== Other modification in Modified Stave Notation ==

Numerals are used in music for all kinds of purposes: in MSN page numbers are distinguished from bar numbers, by being placed in circles, for example. In MSN the use of full size numerals for fingering rather than subscript size is a particular feature. Fingering numbers are also often place in a horizontal line rather than dipping up and down to follow the contour of the [[melody]], enabling a user to memorise the melody and then just follow the fingering numbers.

The need for text to follow easily from column to column, page to page, is especially important in MSN where page turns need to occur where possible at a place where there are bars or at least at suitable musical breaks. Many users of modified print materials read them with additional technological help, such as a closed circuit television screen: for this, the pages need to be able to lie flat. Much music is written in portrait format,&lt;ref&gt;Portrait format is that in which the longer sides of a sheet of paper is at the sides, whereas landscape format is where the longer sides of the paper are at the top and bottom&lt;/ref&gt; whereas landscape is preferred for MSN to reduce the number of times the reader has to track back to the beginning of a new system.

MSN using music notation software enables dyslexic and partially sighted people who struggle to use the huge variety of formats of stave notation to have their music produced in a consistent layout, according to certain conventions, allowing more fluent use.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, E. (2011) "Behind bars: The Definitive Guide to Music Notation" London: Faber Music&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[general relativity]], '''Newtonian gauge''' is a perturbed form of the [[FLRW metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker line element]]. The [[gauge theory|gauge freedom]] of general relativity is used to eliminate two scalar degrees of freedom of the metric, so that it can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 =-(1+2\Psi)dt^2+a^2(t)(1-2\Phi)\delta_{ab}dx^adx^b,&lt;/math&gt;
where the Latin indices ''a'' and ''b'' are summed over the ''spatial'' directions and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. '''Conformal Newtonian gauge''' is the closely related gauge in which
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 =a^2(\tau)[-(1+2\Psi)d\tau^2+(1-2\Phi)\delta_{ab}dx^adx^b]&lt;/math&gt;
which is related by the simple transformation &lt;math&gt;dt=a(t)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;. These metrics are perturbed forms of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]]. They are called Newtonian gauge because &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is the Newtonian [[gravitational potential]] of classical Newtonian [[gravity]], which satisfies the [[Poisson equation]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\Psi=4\pi G\rho&lt;/math&gt; for non-relativistic matter and on scales where the expansion of the universe may be neglected. It includes only [[scalar field|scalar]] perturbations of the metric: by the [[scalar-vector-tensor decomposition]] these evolve independently of the [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] and [[tensor]] perturbations and are the predominant ones affecting the growth of structure in the universe in [[cosmological perturbation theory]]. The vector perturbations vanish in [[cosmic inflation]] and the tensor perturbations are [[gravitational waves]], which have a negligible effect on physics except for the so-called B-modes of the [[cosmic microwave background]] [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]. The tensor perturbation is truly gauge independent, since it is the same in all gauges.

In a universe without anisotropic stress (that is, where the [[stress–energy tensor]] is invariant under spatial rotations, or the three principal pressures are identical) the [[Einstein equation]] sets &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Psi&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Floating-point}}

In [[computing]], a '''normal number''' is a non-zero number in a [[floating point|floating-point representation]] which is within the balanced range supported by a given floating-point format: it is a floating point number that can be represented without leading zeros in its [[significand]].

The magnitude of the smallest normal number in a format is given by ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''emin''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''b'' is the base (radix) of the format (usually 2 or 10) and ''emin'' depends on the size and layout of the format.  

Similarly, the magnitude of the largest normal number in a format is given by 

:''b''&lt;sup&gt;''emax''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; (''b'' &amp;minus; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;minus;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;), 

where ''p'' is the precision of the format in [[numerical digit|digit]]s and ''emax'' is (&amp;minus;''emin'')+1.

In the [[IEEE 754]] binary and decimal formats, ''b'', ''p'', ''emin'', and ''emax'' have the following values:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|}

For example, in the smallest decimal format, the range of positive normal numbers is 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;95&lt;/sup&gt; through 9.999999 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;96&lt;/sup&gt;.

Non-zero numbers smaller in magnitude than the smallest normal number are called [[denormal]] (or subnormal) numbers.  Zero is neither normal nor subnormal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3136">The '''printing patent''' or '''printing privilege''' was a precursor of modern [[copyright]]. It was an exclusive right to print a work or a class of works.

The earliest recorded printing privilege dates from 1469, giving [[John of Speyer]] a five-year [[monopoly]] on all printing in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. In 1495, the city-state granted another monopoly on all Greek works to [[Aldus Manutius|Aldus]] as a reward for his investments in a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[typeface|font]] for his [[printing press|press]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M. (2002) From Private to Public: Reexamining the Technological Basis for Copyright, ''Journal of Communication'', 52, 416-433&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], the royal ''Code de la librairie'' of 1723 codified existing practice. It stated that there was no property in ideas or texts. Ideas, it was argued, were a gift from [[God]], revealed through the writer. [[Divine Right of Kings|God's first representative]], the [[Absolute monarchy in France|French king]] had the exclusive right to determine what could be printed by whom. Only members of the royal guild of publishers could apply for a "printing privilege", a permission and an exclusive right to print a work. Authors wishing to see their manuscript printed had no choice but to sell it to guild members. Most printing privileges were owned by the guild and automatically renewed over generations. In 1789, the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] created by the [[French Revolution]] brought an end to all royal privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, C. (1990) Enlightenment Epistemology and the Laws of Authorship in Revolutionary France, 1777-1793 ''Representations'', 109-137&lt;/ref&gt;

English monarchs granted printing patents based on the [[Royal Prerogative]], with patents falling into one of two categories: ''particular patents'' gave an exclusive right to print a single work &amp;ndash; often popular, classic works written centuries earlier &amp;ndash; for a limited time, usually seven or ten years. ''General patents'' were usually granted for life and covered a class of works, such as law books or [[almanac]]s. Printing patents were independent of the private copyright system established by the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], even though most printing patents were granted to members of the Company. The importance of printing privileges decreased over time, but they still existed after the [[Statute of Anne]] was enacted.&lt;ref name="Patterson1968"&gt;[[Lyman Ray Patterson|Patterson, L. R.]] (1968) ''[[Copyright in Historical Perspective]]'', Vanderbilt University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The royal prerogative relating to printing patents was not removed until 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Donner, I. (1992) The Copyright Clause of the U. S. Constitution: Why Did the Framers Include It with Unanimous Approval? ''The American Journal of Legal History'' 36(3), 361-378&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roots of Europe''' (full name: '''Roots of Europe – Language, Culture, and Migrations''') is an interdisciplinary research centre at the [[University of Copenhagen]], focusing on [[prehistoric Europe]]. It is headed by [[Birgit Anette Olsen]] (2008-2013 by [[Jens Elmegård Rasmussen]]) and involves more than 40 linguists, archaeologists, geneticists and other scholars from universities in Europe and the USA. 
The centre was initiated in 2008 and is financed through the University of Copenhagen Programmes of Excellence. It has close ties to the local programme in [[Indo-European studies]]. It is physically based at the Department of Nordic Studies and Linguistics and hosts the departmental collection of Indo-European linguistics handbooks.

==Structure and activities ==

The common research projects are organized from Copenhagen. While the basic working group there mainly concentrates on the linguistic aspects, the external project members deal both with linguistics, religion and mythology, archaeology and genetics. An international advisory board covers all of the basic fields. From 2013 onwards, the centre also functions as an umbrella for several new research projects, which do not form part of the original programme but are founded by the [[VELUX]] foundation and the Danish Research Council for the Humanities.
Research results emerging from the projects are published mainly in the book series [[Copenhagen Studies in Indo-European]].

'''Scientometrics''' is the study of measuring and analysing [[science]], technology and innovation. Major research issues include the measurement of impact, reference sets of articles to investigate the impact of journals and institutes, understanding of scientific citations, mapping scientific fields and the production of indicators for use in policy and management contexts.&lt;ref name="ScientometricsLeydesdorff"&gt;[[Loet Leydesdorff|Leydesdorff, L.]] and Milojevic, S., "Scientometrics" [https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4566 arXiv:1208.4566] (2013), forthcoming in: Lynch, M. (editor), ''International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences'' subsection 85030. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In practice there is a significant overlap between scientometrics and other scientific fields such as [[bibliometrics]], information systems, [[information science]] and [[science of science policy]].

== Historical development ==
Modern scientometrics is mostly based on the work of [[Derek J. de Solla Price]] and [[Eugene Garfield]]. The latter created the [[Science Citation Index]]&lt;ref name="ScientometricsLeydesdorff" /&gt; and founded the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] which is heavily used for scientometric analysis. A dedicated academic journal, [[Scientometrics (journal)|''Scientometrics'']], was established in 1978. The industrialization of science increased the quantity of publications and research outcomes and the rise of the computers allowed effective analysis of this data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek de Solla Price|De Solla Price, D.]], ''editorial statement''. '''Scientometrics''' Volume 1, Issue 1 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; While the sociology of science focused on the behavior of scientists, scientometrics focused on the analysis of publications.&lt;ref name="ScientometricsLeydesdorff" /&gt; Accordingly, scientometrics is also referred to as the scientific and empirical study of science and its outcomes.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowry | first1 = Paul Benjamin | last2 = Romans | first2 = Denton | last3 = Curtis | first3 = Aaron | year = 2004 | title = Global journal prestige and supporting disciplines: A scientometric study of information systems journals | ssrn = 666145 | journal = Journal of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 29–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowry, Paul Benjamin 2013"&gt;Lowry, Paul Benjamin; Moody, Gregory D.; Gaskin, James; Galletta, Dennis F.; Humpherys, Sean; Barlow, Jordan B.; and Wilson, David W.  (2013). "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2186798  Evaluating journal quality and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) Senior Scholars’ journal basket via bibliometric measures: Do expert journal assessments add value?]," MIS Quarterly (MISQ), vol. 37(4), 993–1012. Also, see YouTube video narrative of this paper at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQIDkA-ke0&amp;feature=youtu.be.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, around the turn of the century, evaluation and ranking of scientists and institutions came more into the spotlights. Based on bibliometric analysis of scientific publications and citations, the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] ("Shanghai ranking") was first published in 2004 by the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]. Impact factors became an important tool to choose between different journals and the rankings such as the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] (THE-ranking) became a leading indicator for the status of universities. The [[H-index|''h''-index]] became an important indicator of the productivity and impact of the work of a scientist. However, alternative author-level indicators has been proposed (see for example&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Belikov, A.V. |author2=Belikov, V.V. | year = 2015 | title = A citation-based, author- and age-normalized, logarithmic index for evaluation of individual researchers independently of publication counts | journal = F1000Research | volume = 4 | pages= 884 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.7070.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Around the same time, interest of governments in evaluating research for the purpose of assessing the impact of science funding increased. As the investments in scientific research were included as part of the U.S. [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA), a major economic stimulus package, programs like [[STAR METRICS]] were set up to assess if the positive impact on the economy would actually occur.&lt;ref name="Lane1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lane | first1 = J | title = Assessing the Impact of Science Funding | url = | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Methods of research include qualitative, quantitative and computational approaches.

One significant finding in the field is a principle of cost escalation to the effect that achieving further findings at a given level of importance grow exponentially more costly in the expenditure of effort and resources. However, new algorithmic methods in search, [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]] are showing that is not the case for many information retrieval and extraction-based problems.

'''Single-photon emission computed tomography''' ('''SPECT''', or less commonly, '''SPET''') is a [[nuclear medicine]] [[tomography|tomographic]] imaging technique using [[gamma ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|SPECT}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very similar to conventional nuclear medicine planar imaging using a [[gamma camera]] (that is, [[scintigraphy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A CdTe detector for hyperspectral SPECT imaging|publisher=IOP Journal of Instrumentation | doi=10.1088/1748-0221/7/08/P08027 | volume=7|journal=Journal of Instrumentation|page=P08027|year=2012|author=Scuffham J W}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is able to provide [[true 3D]] information. This information is typically presented as cross-sectional slices through the patient, but can be freely reformatted or manipulated as required.

The technique requires delivery of a gamma-emitting [[radioisotope]] (a [[radionuclide]]) into the patient, normally through injection into the bloodstream. On occasion, the radioisotope is a simple soluble dissolved ion, such as an  [[Isotopes of gallium|isotope of gallium]](III). Most of the time, though, a marker radioisotope is attached to a specific ligand to create a [[radioligand]], whose properties bind it to certain types of tissues. This marriage allows the combination of ligand and [[radiopharmaceutical]] to be carried and bound to a place of interest in the body, where the ligand concentration is seen by a gamma camera.

==Principles==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:TEMP-Siemens.jpg|thumb|A Siemens brand SPECT scanner, consisting of two gamma cameras.]]
Instead of just "taking a picture of anatomical structures", a SPECT scan monitors level of biological activity at each place in the 3-D region analyzed. Emissions from the radionuclide indicate amounts of blood flow in the capillaries of the imaged regions.  In the same way that a plain [[Radiography|X-ray]] is a 2-dimensional (2-D) view of a 3-dimensional structure, the image obtained by a [[gamma camera]] is a 2-D view of 3-D distribution of a [[radionuclide]].

SPECT imaging is performed by using a gamma camera to acquire multiple 2-D images (also called [[graphical projection|projections]]), from multiple angles. A computer is then used to apply a [[tomographic reconstruction]] algorithm to the multiple projections, yielding a 3-D data set. This data set may then be manipulated to show thin slices along any chosen axis of the body, similar to those obtained from other tomographic techniques, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[X-ray computed tomography]] (X-ray CT), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

SPECT is similar to PET in its use of radioactive tracer material and detection of gamma rays. In contrast with PET, the tracers used in SPECT emit gamma radiation that is measured directly, whereas PET tracers emit positrons that annihilate with electrons up to a few millimeters away, causing two gamma photons to be emitted in opposite directions. A PET scanner detects these emissions "coincident" in time, which provides more radiation event localization information and, thus, higher spatial resolution images than SPECT (which has about 1&amp;nbsp;cm resolution). SPECT scans are significantly less expensive than PET scans, in part because they are able to use longer-lived and more easily obtained radioisotopes than PET.

Because SPECT acquisition is very similar to planar gamma camera imaging, the same [[Radiopharmacology|radiopharmaceuticals]] may be used. If a patient is examined in another type of nuclear medicine scan, but the images are non-diagnostic, it may be possible to proceed straight to SPECT by moving the patient to a SPECT instrument, or even by simply reconfiguring the camera for SPECT image acquisition while the patient remains on the table.

[[File:SPECT CT.JPG|thumb|left|SPECT machine performing a total body bone scan. The patient lies on a table that slides through the machine, while a pair of gamma cameras rotate around her.]]
To acquire SPECT images, the gamma camera is rotated around the patient. Projections are acquired at defined points during the rotation, typically every 3–6 degrees. In most cases, a full 360-degree rotation is used to obtain an optimal reconstruction. The time taken to obtain each projection is also variable, but 15–20 seconds is typical. This gives a total scan time of 15–20 minutes.

Multi-headed gamma cameras can accelerate acquisition. For example, a dual-headed camera can be used with heads spaced 180 degrees apart, allowing two projections to be acquired simultaneously, with each head requiring 180 degrees of rotation. Triple-head cameras with 120-degree spacing are also used.

Cardiac [[gated acquisition (medical imaging)|gated acquisitions]] are possible with SPECT, just as with planar imaging techniques such as [[Radionuclide angiography|multi gated acquisition scan]] (MUGA). Triggered by [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]] (EKG) to obtain differential information about the heart in various parts of its cycle, gated myocardial SPECT can be used to obtain quantitative information about myocardial perfusion, thickness, and contractility of the myocardium during various parts of the cardiac cycle, and also to allow calculation of [[Ejection fraction|left ventricular ejection fraction]], stroke volume, and cardiac output.

==Application==
SPECT can be used to complement any gamma imaging study, where a true 3D representation can be helpful, such as tumor imaging, infection ([[leukocyte]]) imaging, thyroid imaging or [[bone scintigraphy]].

Because SPECT permits accurate localisation in 3D space, it can be used to provide information about localised function in internal organs, such as functional cardiac or brain imaging.

===Myocardial perfusion imaging===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{main article|Myocardial perfusion imaging}}
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a form of functional cardiac imaging, used for the diagnosis of [[ischemic heart disease]]. The underlying principle is that under conditions of stress, diseased [[myocardium]] receives less blood flow than normal myocardium. MPI is one of several types of [[cardiac stress test]].

A cardiac specific radiopharmaceutical is administered, e.g., &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-[[tetrofosmin]] (Myoview, GE healthcare), &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-sestamibi (Cardiolite, Bristol-Myers Squibb) or [[Thallium-201]] chloride. Following this, the heart rate is raised to induce myocardial stress, either by exercise on a [[Treadmill#Exercise treadmills|treadmill]] or pharmacologically with [[adenosine]], [[dobutamine]], or [[dipyridamole]] ([[aminophylline]] can be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole).

SPECT imaging performed after stress reveals the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical, and therefore the relative blood flow to the different regions of the myocardium. Diagnosis is made by comparing stress images to a further set of images obtained at rest which are normally acquired prior to the stress images.

MPI has been demonstrated to have an overall accuracy of about 83% ([[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]]: 85%; [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]]: 72%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12468513|year=2002|last1=Elhendy|first1=A|last2=Bax|first2=JJ|last3=Poldermans|first3=D|title=Dobutamine stress myocardial perfusion imaging in coronary artery disease.|volume=43|issue=12|pages=1634–46|journal=Journal of Nuclear Medicine|url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/43/12/1634.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is comparable with (or better than) other non-invasive tests for ischemic heart disease.

===Functional brain imaging===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{main article|Neuroimaging}}
Usually, the gamma-emitting tracer used in functional brain imaging is [[Technetium (99mTc) exametazime|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO]] (hexamethylpropylene amine oxime). [[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]] is a metastable [[nuclear isomer]] that emits gamma rays that can be detected by a gamma camera. Attaching it to HMPAO allows &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc to be taken up by brain tissue in a manner proportional to brain blood flow, in turn allowing [[cerebral blood flow]] to be assessed with the nuclear gamma camera.

Because blood flow in the brain is tightly coupled to local brain metabolism and energy use, the &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO tracer (as well as the similar &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-EC tracer) is used to assess brain metabolism regionally, in an attempt to diagnose and differentiate the different causal pathologies of [[dementia]]. Meta-analysis of many reported studies suggests that SPECT with this tracer is about 74% sensitive at diagnosing Alzheimer's disease vs. 81% sensitivity for clinical exam ([[cognitive test]]ing, etc.). More recent studies have shown the accuracy of SPECT in Alzheimer's diagnosis may be as high as 88%.&lt;ref name="pmid16785801"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bonte FJ, Harris TS, Hynan LS, Bigio EH, White CL |title=Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT in the differential diagnosis of the dementias with histopathologic confirmation |journal=Clin Nucl Med |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=376–8 |year=2006|pmid=16785801 |doi=10.1097/01.rlu.0000222736.81365.63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In meta analysis, SPECT was superior to clinical exam and clinical criteria (91% vs. 70%) in being able to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from vascular dementias.&lt;ref name="pmid15545324"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dougall NJ, Bruggink S, Ebmeier KP |title=Systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT in dementia |journal=Am J Geriatr Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=554–70 |year=2004 |pmid=15545324 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajgp.12.6.554}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter ability relates to SPECT's imaging of local metabolism of the brain, in which the patchy loss of cortical metabolism seen in multiple strokes differs clearly from the more even or "smooth" loss of non-occipital cortical brain function typical of Alzheimer's disease. Another recent review article showed that multi-headed SPECT cameras with quantitative analysis result in an overall sensitivity of 84-89% and an overall specificity of 83-89% in cross sectional studies and sensitivity of 82-96% and specificity of 83-89% for longitudinal studies of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henderson|first=Theodore|title=The diagnosis and evaluation of dementia and mild cognitive impairment with emphasis on SPECT perfusion neuroimaging|journal=CNS Spectrums|date=December 2012|volume=17|issue=4|pages=188–89|doi=10.1017/S1092852912000636|pmid=22929226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO SPECT scanning competes with [[fludeoxyglucose]] (FDG) [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scanning of the brain, which works to assess regional brain glucose metabolism, to provide very similar information about local brain damage from many processes. SPECT is more widely available, because the radioisotope used  is longer-lasting and far less expensive in SPECT, and the gamma scanning equipment is less expensive as well. While &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is extracted from relatively simple [[technetium-99m generator]]s, which are delivered to hospitals and scanning centers weekly to supply fresh radioisotope, FDG PET relies on FDG, which is made in an expensive medical [[cyclotron]] and "hot-lab" (automated chemistry lab for radiopharmaceutical manufacture), and then   delivered immediately to scanning sites because of the natural short 110-minute half-life of [[Fluorine-18]].

===Applications in nuclear technology===
In the nuclear power sector, the SPECT technique can be applied to image radioisotope distributions in irradiated nuclear fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:164459/FULLTEXT01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the irradiation of nuclear fuel (e.g. uranium) with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, a wide array of gamma-emitting radionuclides are naturally produced in the fuel, such as fission products ([[cesium-137]], [[barium-140]] and [[europium-154]]) and activation products ([[chromium-51]] and [[cobalt-58]]). These may be imaged using SPECT in order to verify the presence of fuel rods in a stored fuel assembly for [[IAEA safeguards]] purposes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/25/037/25037535.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to validate predictions of core simulation codes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.13182/NT05-A3632 | volume=151 | title=Nondestructive Experimental Determination of the Pin-Power Distribution in Nuclear Fuel Assemblies | year=2005 | journal=Nuclear Technology | pages=70–76 | author=Jacobsson Svärd Staffan, Håkansson Ane, Bäcklin Anders, Osifo Otasowie, Willman Christopher, Jansson Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to study the behavior of the nuclear fuel in normal operation,

==Reconstruction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Coded aperture mask (for gamma camera).jpg|thumb|[[Coded aperture]] mask for [[gamma camera]]]]
Reconstructed images typically have resolutions of 64&amp;times;64 or 128&amp;times;128 pixels, with the pixel sizes ranging from 3–6&amp;nbsp;mm. The number of projections acquired is chosen to be approximately equal to the width of the resulting images. In general, the resulting reconstructed images will be of lower resolution, have increased noise than planar images, and be susceptible to [[Artifact (observational)|artifacts]].

Scanning is time consuming, and it is essential that there is no patient movement during the scan time. Movement can cause significant degradation of the reconstructed images, although movement compensation reconstruction techniques can help with this. A highly uneven distribution of radiopharmaceutical also has the potential to cause artifacts. A very intense area of activity (e.g., the bladder) can cause extensive streaking of the images and obscure neighboring areas of activity. This is a limitation of the [[filtered back projection]] reconstruction algorithm. [[Iterative reconstruction]] is an alternative algorithm that is growing in importance, as it is less sensitive to artifacts and can also correct for attenuation and depth dependent blurring. Furthermore, iterative algorithms can be made more efficacious using the [[Superiorization]] methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.3934/ipi.2014.8.223 | year=2014| volume=8 | vauthors = Luo,S, Zhou,T|title=Superiorization of EM algorithm and its application in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) | journal=Inverse Problems and Imaging | pages=88–97| arxiv=1209.6116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attenuation of the gamma rays within the patient can lead to significant underestimation of activity in deep tissues, compared to superficial tissues. Approximate correction is possible, based on relative position of the activity, and optimal correction is obtained with measured attenuation values. Modern SPECT equipment is available with an integrated X-ray CT scanner. As X-ray CT images are an attenuation map of the tissues, this data can be incorporated into the SPECT reconstruction to correct for attenuation. It also provides a precisely [[Image registration|registered]] CT image, which can provide additional anatomical information.

Scatter of the gamma rays as well as the random nature of gamma rays can also lead to the degradation of quality of SPECT images and cause loss of resolution. Scatter correction and resolution recovery are also applied to improve resolution of SPECT images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3134425_Three-dimensional_restoration_of_single_photon_emission_computed_tomography_images|title= D.

==SPECT/CT==
In some cases a SPECT gamma scanner may be built to operate with a [[x-ray computed tomography|conventional CT scanner]], with coregistration of images. As in [[PET-CT|PET/CT]], this allows location of tumors or tissues which may be seen on SPECT scintigraphy, but are difficult to locate precisely with regard to other anatomical structures. Such scans are most useful for tissues outside the brain, where location of tissues may be far more variable. For example, SPECT/CT may be used in [[sestamibi parathyroid scan]] applications, where the technique is useful in locating ectopic parathyroid adenomas which may not be in their usual locations in the thyroid gland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18997051 | doi=10.2967/jnumed.108.054858 | volume=49 | title=Preoperative 123I/99mTc-sestamibi subtraction SPECT and SPECT/CT in primary hyperparathyroidism | author=Neumann DR, Obuchowski NA, Difilippo FP | journal=J Nucl Med | pages=2012–7 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''star transit''' is the passage of a star across the [[field of view]] of a [[telescope]] [[eyepiece]].

The precise observation of star transits is the basis of many methods in [[astronomy]] and in [[geodesy]]. The measurements can be done in different ways:
# [[visually]] (mostly up to 1990): accuracy 0,1" to 2" (depending on the instrument); timing with digital clocks about 0,05–0,2 seconds
# by [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] and other [[electro-optical sensor]]s: as above, time often better
# semi automatic instruments: [[Photography]] or "[[impersonal micrometer]]", ca. 2 times better than No.1
# by Scanning methods: [[Astrometry]] [[satellite]]s like [[Hipparcos]] about 0,01".

A '''steam rupture''' occurs within a pressurized system of super critical water when the pressure exceeds the design plus [[safety margin]] specification.  A steam rupture can occur in any elevated temperature pressurized system, including, but not limited to:  Automobile cooling systems, stationary power plants, mobile power plants, steam driven tools (such as some [[trip hammer]]s), and even the delivery systems for application processes such as cleaning and fabric fullering.

Outside the field of language education this type of pedagogic practice is increasingly being used to internationalize the curriculum and offer students the possibility to engage with peers in other parts of the world in collaborative online projects. Different terms are used to refer to this practice, for example [[virtual exchange]], collaborative online international learning ([http://coil.suny.edu/page/brief-history-suny-coil-center COIL]),&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, J. &amp; Guth, S.

==Telecollaboration 2.0==
Guth and Helm (2010)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=S |first1=Guth |last2=F |first2=Helm |title=Telecollaboration 2.0: Language, literacies and intercultural learning in the 21st century (Vol. 1) |date=2010 |publisher=Peter Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; built on the pedagogy of telecollaboration by expanding on its traditional practices via incorporating [[Web 2.0|'''Web 2.0''']] tools in online collaborative projects. This enriched practice widely became known as telecollaboration 2.0.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Telecollaboration 2.0, [Http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Telecollaboration|not being a completely new phase], serves to achieve nearly the same goals of telecollaboration. A distinctive feature of Telecollaboration 2.0, however, lies in prioritizing promoting the development and mastery of new online literacies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although telecollaboration and telecollaboration 2.0 are used interchangeably, the latter slightly differs in affording "a complex context for language education as it involves the simultaneous use and development" of intercultural competencies,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; internationalize classrooms and promotes authentic intercultural communication&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; among partnering schools/students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Models==
There are several different 'models' of telecollaboration which have been extensively described in the literature.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;O’Rourke, B. (2007). Models of telecollaboration (1): eTandem. In R. O’Dowd (Ed.). ''Online intercultural exchange: An introduction for foreign language teachers'' (pp. 41-61). Clevedon: Multilingual Matters. 
&lt;/ref&gt;  The first models to be developed were based on the partnering of foreign language students with "native speakers" of the target language, usually by organizing exchanges between two classes of foreign language students studying one another's languages. The most well established models are the eTandem and the [https://cultura.mit.edu Cultura], and [[eTwinning]] models.

eTandem, which developed from the face to face Tandem Learning approach, has been widely adopted by individual learners who seek partners on the many available educational websites which offer to help find partners and suggest activities for tandem partners to engage in.  However, the eTandem model has also been used for class-to-class telecollaboration projects where teachers establish specific objectives, tasks, and/or topics for discussion.&lt;ref&gt;
O’Rourke, B. (2007). Models of telecollaboration (1): eTandem. In R. O’Dowd (Ed.). ''Online intercultural exchange: An introduction for foreign language teachers'' (pp. 41-61). Clevedon: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [http://www.teletandembrasil.org Teletandem] model&lt;ref&gt;Leone, P. &amp; Telles, J. (2016). The Teletandem network. In T. Lewis, &amp; R. O'Dowd (ends), ''Online Intercultural Exchange: Policy, Pedagogy, Practice'' (pp. 241-249). London/New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on eTandem and was developed in Brazil, but focuses on oral communication through VOIP tools such as Skype and Google Hangouts. Until recent years, however, telecollaboration has generally used asynchronous communication tools.

The Cultura project was developed by teachers of French as a foreign language at MIT in the late 1990s with the aim of making culture the focus of their foreign language class.&lt;ref&gt;Furstenberg, G., Levet, S., English, K., &amp; Maillet, K. (2001). Giving a voice to the silent culture of language: The CULTURA project. ''[http://llt.msu.edu/vol5num1/furstenberg/default.pdf Language Learning &amp; Technology]'', 5(1), 55–102.&lt;/ref&gt; This model takes its inspiration from the words of the Russian philosopher [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]: "It is only in the eyes of another culture that foreign culture reveals itself fully and profoundly ... A meaning only reveals its depths once it has encountered and come into contact with another foreign meaning" (as cited in Furstenberg, Levet, English, &amp; Maillet, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;58). Cultura is based on the notion and process of cultural comparison and entails students analysing cultural products in class with their teachers and interacting with students of the target languages and cultures through which they develop a deeper understanding of each other's culture, attitudes, representations, values, and frames of reference.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Furstenberg, G. (2016).  The Cultura exchange program. In O'Dowd, R. &amp; Lewis, T. (2016) (Eds.), Online intercultural exchange: Policy, pedagogy, practice (pp. 248-255). London/New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The eTwinning project, which essentially is a network of schools and educators within the European Union and part of [http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en Eramus+], contrasts with its earlier counterparts in not setting specific guidelines apropos of language use, themes or structure.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Languages for Intercultural Communication and Education|last=Miguela|first=A. D.|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=O’Dowd|editor-first=R.|location=Clevedon|pages=15, 85|chapter=Models of telecollaboration (3): eTwinning}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model serves as a broad platform for schools within the EU to exchange information and share materials online, and provides a virtual space for countless pedagogical opportunities where teachers and students collectively learn, communicate and collaborate using a foreign language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Quintessentially, eTwinning has the following four objectives: '''1.''' setting up a collaborative network among European schools by connecting them via [https://teaching.pitt.edu/blog/web-2-0-tools-in-teaching-and-learning/ Web 2.0 tools]; '''2.''' encouraging educators and students to collaborate with their counterparts in other European countries; '''3.''' fostering a learning environment in which European identity is integrated with multilingualism and multiculturalism; '''4.''' continuously developing educators' professional skills "in the pedagogical and collaborative use of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  eTwinning has thus proven to be a strong model for telecollaboration in recent years, since it enables the authentic use of foreign language among virtual partners, i.e. teachers and students. Not surprisingly, eTwinning projects have become increasingly recognized at various educational institutions across the continent.
Each of the telecollaborative models discussed above has its strengths and weaknesses:

'''''The Will to Doubt: An Essay in Philosophy for the General Thinker''''' is a [[book]] published in 1907 by [[University of Michigan]] professor [[Alfred Henry Lloyd]]. Professor Lloyd would later become interim President of the University of Michigan in 1925.

==Thesis==
''The Will to Doubt'' was Lloyd's fourth book and was published as a volume in the Ethical Library Series. The book was a response to [[William James]]' 1896 collection of essays titled ''[[The Will to Believe]]''. Professor Lloyd's simple thesis is that "doubt is essential to real belief".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/willtodoubtessay00lloyrich#page/n11/mode/2up ''The Will to Doubt'']. London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1907, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote at the beginning of the 20th century, in what he called an age of doubt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We would often hide it from others, not to say from ourselves, but it is there, and we all know it to be there.&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Though many fear doubt, and try to keep it hidden and locked away, the confession of doubt is in fact the beginning of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Themes==
Fear is a chief motivator of [[dogmatism]], and dogmatic people are slaves to their fears. This is not genuine confidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; But doubt is not the road to [[atheism]]; in fact, doubt is part of a very difficult road to [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] built upon these arguments in subsequent years, even directly referencing Lloyd in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]].

'''Theories on the [[causes of poverty]]''' are the foundation upon which [[poverty reduction]] strategies are based.

While in [[developed nations]] [[poverty]] is often seen as either a personal or a structural defect, in [[developing nations]] the issue of poverty is more profound due to the lack of governmental funds. Some theories on poverty in the developing world focus on [[cultural]] characteristics as a retardant of further development. Other theories focus on social and political aspects that perpetuate poverty; perceptions of the poor have a significant impact on the design and execution of programs to alleviate poverty.

== Causes of poverty in the United States==

===Poverty as a personal failing===
When it comes to [[poverty in the United States]], there are two main lines of thought. The most common line of thought within the U.S. is that a person is poor because of personal traits.&lt;ref name="rank_full"&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|pp=&lt;!-- full --&gt;3–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These traits in turn have caused the person to fail. Supposed traits range from personality characteristics, such as laziness, to educational levels. Despite this range, it is always viewed as the individual's personal failure not to climb out of poverty. This thought pattern stems from the idea of [[meritocracy]] and its entrenchment within U.S. thought. Meritocracy, according to Katherine S. Newman is “the view that those who are worthy are rewarded and those who fail to reap rewards must also lack self-worth.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1999|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that all followers of meritocracy believe that a person in poverty deserves their low standard of living. Rather the underlying ideas of personal failure show in the resistance to social and economic programs such as welfare; a poor individual's lack of prosperity shows a personal failing and should not be compensated (or justified) by the state.

===Poverty as a structural failing===
[[#CITEREFRankYoonHershl2003|Rank, Yoon, and Hirschl (2003)]] present a contrary argument to the idea that personal failings are the cause of poverty. The argument presented is that United States poverty is result of “failings at the structural level.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Key social and economic structural failings which contribute heavily to poverty within the U.S. are identified in the article. The first is a failure of the job market to provide a proper amount of jobs which pay enough to keep families out of poverty. Even if unemployment is low, the labor market may be saturated with low-paying, part-time work that lacks benefits (thus limiting the amount of full-time, good paying jobs). Rank, Yoon and Hirschl examined the [[Survey of Income and Program Participation]] (SIPP), a longitudinal study on employment and income. Using the 1999 official poverty line of $17,029 for a family of four, it was found that 9.4% of persons working full-time and 14.9% of persons working at least part-time did not earn enough annually to keep them above the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed that 29% of families in The United States could go six months or longer during a hardship with no income. Over 50% of respondents said around two months with no income and another 20% said they could not go longer than two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hacker|first=Jacob S.|last2=Rehm|first2=Philipp|last3=Schlesinger|first3=Mark|date=2013-03-01|title=The Insecure American: Economic Experiences, Financial Worries, and Policy Attitudes|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1537592712003647|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=11|issue=01|pages=23–49|doi=10.1017/S1537592712003647|issn=1541-0986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low minimum wage, combined with part-time jobs which offer no benefits, have contributed to the labor market's inability to produce enough jobs which can keep a family out of poverty is an example of an economic structural failure.&lt;ref name="rank_full" /&gt;

Rank, Yoon and Hirschl point to the minimal amount of [[social safety net]]s found within the U.S. as a social structural failure and a major contributor to poverty in the U.S. Other industrialized nations devote more resources to assisting the poor than the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this difference poverty is reduced in nations which devote more to poverty reduction measure and programs. Rank et al. use a table to drive this point home. The table shows that in 1994, the actual rate of poverty (what the rate would be without government interventions) in the U.S. was 29%. When compared to actual rates in Canada (29%), Finland (33%), France (39%), Germany (29%), [[the Netherlands]] (30%), [[Norway]] (27%), [[Sweden]] (36%) and the [[United Kingdom]] (38%), the United States rate is low. But when government measures and programs are included, the rate of reduction in poverty in the United States is low (38%). [[Canada]] and the United Kingdom had the lowest reduction rates outside of the U.S. at 66%, while Sweden, Finland and Norway had reduction rates greater than 80% (All percentages taken from {{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=17}}).

Some authors feel that the national mindset itself plays a role in the ability for a country to develop and to thus reduce poverty. [[#CITEREFGrondona2000|Mariano Grondona (2000)]] outlines twenty “cultural factors” which, depending on the culture's view of each, can be indicators as to whether the cultural environment is favorable or resistant to development. In turn [[#CITEREFHarrison2000|Lawrence E. Harrison (2000)]] identifies ten “values” which, like Grondona's factors, can be indicative of the nation's developmental environment. Finally, [[#CITEREFLindsay2000|Stace Lindsay (2000)]] claims the differences between development-prone and development-resistant nations is attributed to mental models (which, like values, influence the decisions humans make). Mental models are also cultural creations. Grondona, Harrison and Lindsay all feel that without development orientated values and mindsets, nations will find it difficult if not impossible to develop efficiently, and that some sort of cultural change will be needed in these nations in order to reduce poverty.

In “A Cultural Typology of Economic Development”, from the book Culture Matters, Mariano Grondona claims development is a matter of decisions. These decisions, whether they are favorable to economic development or not, are made within the context of culture. All cultural values considered together create “value systems”. These systems heavily influence the way decisions are made as well as the reactions and outcomes of said decisions. In the same book, Stace Lindsay's chapter claims the decisions individuals make are a result of mental models. These mental models influence all aspects of human action. Like Grondona's value systems, these mental models which dictate a nations stance toward development and hence its ability to deal with poverty.

Grondona presents two ideal [[value system]]s (mental models), one of which has values only favoring development, the other only with value which resist development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grondona|2000|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Real value systems fluctuate and fall somewhere between the two poles, but developed countries tend to bunch near one end, while [[undeveloped countries]] bunch near the other. Grondona goes on to identify twenty cultural factors on which the two value systems stand in opposition. These factors include such things as the dominant religion; the role of the individual in society; the value placed on work; concepts of wealth, competition, justice and time; and the role of education. In “Promoting Progressive Cultural Change”, also from Culture Matters, Lawrence E. Harrison identifies values, like Grondona's factors, which differ between “progressive” cultures and “static” cultures. Religion, value of work, overall justice and time orientation are included in his list, but Harrison also adds [[frugality]] and community as important factors. Like Grondona and Harrison, Lindsay also presents “patterns of thought” which differ between nations that stand at opposite poles of the developmental scale. Lindsay focuses more on economic aspects such as the form of capital focused upon and market characteristics. Key themes which emerge from these lists as characteristic of developmental cultures are: trust in the individual with a fostering of individual strengths; the ability for free thinking in an open, safe environment; importance of questioning/innovation; law is supreme and holds the power; future orientated time frame with an emphasis on achievable, practical goals; meritocracy; an autonomous mindset within the larger world; strong work ethic is highly valued and rewarded; a microeconomic focus; and a value that is non-economic, but not anti-economic, which is always wanting. Characteristics of the ideal non-developmental value system are: suppression of the individual through control of information and censorship; present/past time orientation with emphasis on grandiose, often unachievable, goals; [[macroeconomic]] focus; access to leaders allowing for easier and greater corruption; unstable distribution of law and justice (family and its connections matter most); and a passive mindset within the larger world.

Grondona, Harrison, and Lindsay all feel that at least some aspects of development-resistant cultures need to change in order to allow under-developed nations (and cultural minorities within developed nations) to develop effectively. According to their argument, poverty is fueled by cultural characteristics within under-developed nations, and in order for poverty to be brought under control, said nations must move down the development path.

===Poverty as a label===
Various theorists believe the way poverty is approached, defined, and thus thought about, plays a role in its perpetuation. [[#CITEREFGreen2006|Maia Green (2006)]] explains that modern development literature tends to view poverty as agency filled. When poverty is prescribed agency, poverty becomes something that happens to people. Poverty absorbs people into itself and the people, in turn, become a part of poverty, devoid of their human characteristics. In the same way, poverty, according to Green, is viewed as an object in which all social relations (and persons involved) are obscured. Issues such as structural failings (see earlier section), institutionalized inequalities, or corruption may lie at the heart of a region's poverty, but these are obscured by broad statements about poverty. [[Arjun Appadurai]] writes of the “terms of recognition” (drawn from Charles Taylor's ‘points of recognition), which are given the poor are what allows poverty to take on this generalized autonomous form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2006|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are “given” to the poor because the poor lack social and economic capital, and thus have little to no influence on how they are represented and/or perceived in the larger community. Furthermore, the term “poverty”, is often used in a generalized matter. This further removes the poor from defining their situation as the broadness of the term covers differences in histories and causes of local inequalities. Solutions or plans for reduction of poverty often fail precisely because the context of a region's poverty is removed and local conditions are not considered.

The specific ways in which the poor and poverty are recognized frame them in a negative light. In development literature, poverty becomes something to be eradicated, or, attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2006|pp=&lt;!--full --&gt;1108–1129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is always portrayed as a singular problem to be fixed. When a negative view of poverty (as an animate object) is fostered, it can often lead to an extension of negativity to those who are experiencing it. This in turn can lead to justification of inequalities through the idea of the deserving poor. Even if thought patterns do not go as far as justification, the negative light poverty is viewed in, according to Appadurai, does much to ensure little change in the policies of redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appadurai|2004|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty as restriction of opportunities===
The environment of poverty is one marked with unstable conditions and a lack of capital (both social and economical) which together create the vulnerability characteristic of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chakravarti|2006||pp=&lt;!--full --&gt;363–376}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because a person's daily life is lived within the person's environment, a person's environment determines daily decisions and actions based on what is present and what is not. Dipkanar Chakravarti argues that the poor's daily practice of navigating the world of poverty generates a fluency in the poverty environment but a near illiteracy in the environment of the larger society. Thus, when a poor person enters into transactions and interactions with the social norm, that person's understanding of it is limited, and thus decisions revert to decisions most effective in the poverty environment. Through this a sort of cycle is born in which the “dimensions of poverty are not merely additive, but are interacting and reinforcing in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chakravarti|2006|p=365}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[#CITEREFAppadurai2004|Arjun Appadurai (2004)]], the key to the environment of poverty, which causes the poor to enter into this cycle, is the poor's lack of capacities. Appardurai's idea of capacity relates to Albert Hirschman's ideas of “voice” and “exit” which are ways in which people can decline aspects of their environment; to voice displeasure and aim for change or to leave said aspect of environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appadurai|2004|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a person in poverty lacks adequate voice and exit (capacities) with which they can change their position. Appadurai specifically deals with the capacity to aspire and its role in the continuation of poverty and its environment. Aspirations are formed through social life and its interactions. Thus, it can be said, that one's aspirations are influenced by one's environment. Appadurai claims that the better off one is, the more chances one has to not only reach aspirations but to also see the pathways which lead to the fulfillment of aspirations. By actively practicing the use of their capacity of aspiration the elite not only expand their aspiration horizon but also solidify their ability to reach aspirations by learning the easiest and most efficient paths through said practice. On the other hand, the poor's horizon of aspiration is much closer and less steady than that of the elite.

Thus, the capacity to aspire requires practice, and, as Chakravarti argues, when a capacity (or decision making process) is not refined through practice it falters and often fails. The unstable life of poverty often limits the poor's aspiration levels to those of necessity (such as having food to feed ones family) and in turn reinforces the lowered aspiration levels (someone who is busy studying, instead of looking for ways to get enough food, will not survive long in the poverty environment). Because the capacity to aspire (or lack thereof) reinforces and perpetuates the cycle of poverty, Appadurai claims that expanding the poor's aspiration horizon will help the poor to find both voice and exit. Ways of doing this include changing the terms of recognition (see previous section) and/or creating programs which provide the poor with an arena in which to practice capacities. An example of one such arena may be a housing development built for the poor, by the poor. Through this, the poor are able to not only show their abilities but to also gain practice dealing with governmental agencies and society at large. Through collaborative projects, the poor are able to expand their aspiration level above and beyond tomorrow's meal to the cultivation of skills and the entrance into the larger market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appadurai|2004|pp=&lt;!-- full --&gt;59–84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zotino Tall Tower Observation Facility''' (ZOTTO) is a [[climatic]] [[research station]] in the [[Siberia]]n [[taiga]] in the proximity of [[Krasnoyarsk Krai|Zotino]], [[Russia]], established and operated by the [[Max Planck Society]] and the [[Sukachev Institute of Forest]], it serves as a long-term observing platform to be operated for at least 30 years.

Far from human influences, researchers aim to determine how the concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es, aerosols, and the [[global warming|rising temperatures of the terrestrial atmosphere]] affect each other mutually.

The heart of the station is a {{convert|302|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b56680|title=Drawings of Zotino Tall Tower Observatory|publisher=[[SkyscraperPage]]|accessdate=2010-12-22|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2588909&lt;/ref&gt; tower on which precision instruments measure the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other greenhouse gases. The measurement data are processed directly in the station at the foot of the tower and then transferred to the Institute of Forest, in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Russia]], as well as to the [[Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry]] in [[Jena]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zottoproject.org/|title=ZOTTOproject.org|location=Central Siberia|accessdate=2010-12-22|year=2010|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry|first=Jan|last=Winderlich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station has been operational since September 2006. It extended the project Terrestrial Carbon Observing System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afoludata.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php/public_area/Research_projects_2009|title=Europa|location=Central Siberia|accessdate=2010-12-22|year=2010|publisher=Europa}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was funded by the 5th framework programme of the [[European Union]], uniting 8 [[Europe]]an and 4 Russian partners. A main conclusion of the project is that Siberian forests constitute a substantially smaller carbon-sink than so far assumed.
