The '''A684''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] that runs through [[Cumbria]] and [[North Yorkshire]], starting at [[Kendal|Kendal, Cumbria]] and ending at [[Ellerbeck]] and the [[A19 road]] in North Yorkshire. It crosses the full width of the [[Yorkshire Dales]], passing through [[Garsdale]] and the full length of [[Wensleydale]].

Flooding can be a problem after heavy rain, especially at Appersett, near Hawes, and heavy snow can close the road temporarily at the Black Horse hill and in Garsdale.

== The route ==
The A684 has primary status for the short length between Kendal and junction 37 of the [[M6 motorway]], though even this primary section involves two hills and some tricky twists. East of the M6, the road descends the "Black Horse" hill and passes through Sedbergh where there is a short diversion to avoid the main street and a difficult right-angled bend. Another right-angled bend {{convert|6|mi}} east at Garsdale Hall, and the road goes further up the valley to the watershed at Garsdale Head. After this the road passes under Garsdale (or Dandry Mire, or Moorcock) viaduct&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Railway Track Diagrams - Midland &amp; North West|last = Bridge|first = Mike|publisher = Trackmaps|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-9549866-7-4|location = Bradford-On-Avon|pages = 34B}}&lt;/ref&gt; where after there is a junction with the [[B6259 road]] to [[Kirkby Stephen]]. The road drops down through upper Wensleydale into Appersett, a junction with the [[B6255 road|B6255]] and into the town of Hawes

There is a 17-ton MGW (maximum gross weight) restriction over the bridge spanning the [[Widdale|Widdale Beck]] in Appersett. Because of this, heavy eastbound traffic must leave just before the bridge and proceed onto an unclassified road through [[Hardraw]] and then turn south onto Burnt Acres Lane bringing the vehicles back to the A684 just east of Hawes town centre. Heavy westbound traffic from the B6255 is expected to go through Hawes eastwards and then back through Hardraw to avoid the weight restriction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.northyorks.gov.uk/media/1258/Hawes-Traffic-Management-Strategy/pdf/pdf8750898361042147390.pdf|title = Hawes Traffic Management Survey|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = North Yorkshire County Council|last = |first = |page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hawes, after the junction with B6255 road to [[Ingleton, North Yorkshire|Ingleton]], the road splits into single lanes with the eastbound fork dropping down to the junction with Burnt Acres Lane and the westbound taking a cobbled road through the town. The two forks meet up at the Market Square in Hawes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is a triangular road junction in Bainbridge with the road to Askrigg before the road goes east again over the [[River Bain, North Yorkshire|River Bain]]. After passing Askrigg and bridging the confluence of the [[Bishopdale Beck|Bishopdale]] and [[Walden beck|Walden]] Becks, the road meets the [[B6160 road|B6160]] from [[Addingham]] where there is a [[grade II]] listed [[Automobile Association (UK)|AA phone box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Everett|first1=Betsy|title=Fears that iconic AA Call box at risk due to neglect|work=Darlington &amp; Stockton Times|issue=25-2017|date=23 June 2017|page=6|issn=2040-3933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It then passes through West Witton, Wensley, Leyburn (where it runs in tandem with the [[A6108 road|A6108]] for a short distance), Constable Burton, Patrick Brompton and Crakehall before arriving at Bedale. The road used to continue through Bedale Town and on through Aiskew and then after another ungated crossing of the Wesleydale Railway, it had a junction with a slip road to the [[A6055 road|A6055]] (the old A1 Junction going North). Now, Bedale is bypassed (see below) and the road intersects with the A6055 and the [[A1(M)]] just north of Leeming Bar and rejoins the old route just east of Leeming Bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A1 J51 Leeming Bar Interchange|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/a1/730|website=CBRD|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road then heads out through Morton-On-Swale, Ainderby Steeple and into Northallerton where it first meets the A167 and runs in tandem as the [[A167 road|A167]] through Northallerton. The road crosses two adjacent railways in the town; the first is a gated crossing on the freight lines to and from [[Teesside]], and the second is under the railway station at [[Northallerton railway station|Northallerton]] on the [[East Coast Main Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.northyorks.gov.uk/media/1263/Northallerton-Traffic-Management-Strategy/pdf/pdf1309104998179652066.pdf|title = Northallerton Traffic Management Survey|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = North Yorkshire County Council|last = |first = |page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The road carries on eastwards meeting the [[A168 road|A168]] and loops east then northwards around the town centre before it leaves the A167/A168 and heads north out of the town.

The road then heads mainly eastwards avoiding Brompton but going through Ellerbeck before arriving at a large junction with the A19 that allows access north and south and also onto an unclassified road into [[Osmotherley, North Yorkshire|Osmotherley]].

== Bedale Bypass ==
On 16 July 2014 the Department of Transport announced the go-ahead for the villages of [[Leeming Bar]] and [[Aiskew]] and the town of [[Bedale]] in North Yorkshire to be bypassed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/29-million-for-north-yorkshire-bypass|title=£29 million for North Yorkshire bypass|publisher=Department of Transport|date=16 July 2014|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bypass, which opened to traffic on the 11 August 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New £35m Bedale bypass opens two months ahead of schedule|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-37020603|accessdate=18 August 2016|work=BBC News|date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaves the current A684 just north of [[Church of St Gregory, Bedale|St Gregory's Church]] in Bedale and runs eastwards for {{convert|3|mi}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Minting|first1=Stuart|title=Motorists warned of Bedale bypass construction work delays|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/12884476.Motorists_warned_of_Bedale_bypass_construction_work_delays/?ref=ar|accessdate=22 February 2016|work=The Northern Echo|date=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a point about {{convert|1|km|mi|1|order=flip}} east of Leeming Bar. It connects with junction 51 on the A1M and the [[A6055 road|A6055]] just north of Leeming Bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A684 Bedale, Aiskew and|url=http://www.northyorks.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=20606&amp;p=0|publisher=North Yorkshire County Council|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
In 2014, [[EuroRAP]] published a brochure based on data collected between 2010 and 2012. It listed the A684 as being a High Risk road along its entire length from the M6 to the A19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.roadsafetyfoundation.org/media/30870/eurorap_brochure_2014.pdf|title = Road Safety Foundation EuroRAP brochure 2014|date = |accessdate = 29 October 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auh''' is a historical [[Chechens|Chechen]] settlement in [[Dagestan]].

== History ==
In 1921, Auh was included in the [[Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Dagestan ASSR]], despite the desire of Akkins to join the [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. According to another explanation, the reason was the entering Akkins fear of losing their winter pastures in the territory of the [[Khasavyurtovsky District]]. In 1943, the territory was incorporated into the Auha Auhovsky area. In 1944 Akkin Chechens were deported to Central Asia. The area of the historic residence was renamed the [[Novolaksky District]] and inhabited by [[Laks (Caucasus)|Laks]]. The [[yurt]] villages Auch and Auch-Aktas were transferred to the [[Kazbekovski District]] and inhabited by [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]]. In 1956, the Chechens (including the Akkin) began to return to their historical homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/20318/RS |title=Akkin in Russia |author=|date= |website=joshuaproject.net |publisher=Joshua Project |access-date=February 26, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chechens' homes were located in the mountains, next to the [[Caspian Sea]]. In 1718 the [[Don Cossacks|Don cossacks]] were sent to destroy their houses and many were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/viewer/01004102182#?page=565 Историческое описание российской коммерции при всех портах и границах : От древних времян до ныне настоящаго и всех преимущественных узаконений по оной государя имп.

A '''biosurvey,''' or biological survey, is a scientific study of [[organism]]s to assess the condition of an [[ecological]] resource, such as a [[water body]].

==Overview==
Biosurveys are used by government agencies responsible for management of public lands, environmental planning and/or environmental [[regulation]] to assess ecological resources, such as [[river]]s, [[stream]]s, [[lake]]s and [[wetland]]s. They involve collection and analysis of animal and/or plant samples which serve as [[bioindicator]]s. The studies may be conducted by professional scientists or volunteer organizations.  They are conducted according to published procedures to ensure consistency in data collection and analysis, and to compare findings to established metrics.

Biosurveys typically use metrics such as [[species]] composition and richness (e.g. number of species, extent of pollution-tolerant species), and ecological factors (number of individuals, proportion of [[predator]]s, presence of disease). Biosurveys may identify [[water pollution|pollution]] problems that are difficult or expensive to detect using [[water pollution#Chemical testing|chemical testing]] procedures.&lt;ref name="Karr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A biosurvey may be used to generate an [[index of biological integrity]] (IBI), a scoring system for an ecological resource.&lt;ref name="Karr"/&gt;

'''Blidinje Nature Park''' is a [[nature park]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], established on 30 April 1995. It is situated in the heart of [[Dinaric Alps]] and represent important natural, [[hydrogeological]] reservat in Dinaric [[karst]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with significant cultural and historical heritage. It consist of major mountains of Dinaric Alps range, [[plateau]] [[Dugopolje (Blidinje)|Dugopolje]], [[Blidinje Lake]], [[Grabovica valley]] and other characteristic karstic features.&lt;ref name="NP-Blidinje-visitmycountry.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature Park Blidinje|url=http://www.visitmycountry.net/bosnia_herzegovina/en/index.php/national-parks/66-bastina/nacionalni-parkovi/262-nature-park-blidinje|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography and hydrology ==
The melting [[glacier]]s from [[Čvrsnica]] during the two past [[ice age]]s created this open and barren valley. A spacious [[plateau]], 3–5&amp;nbsp;km long, is situated at an elevation of 1.150-1.300 meters a.s.l., between [[Čvrsnica]] and [[Vran]] mountains with a total area of 364&amp;nbsp;km². Although [[geomorphologically]] one whole, plateau is divided in two geographically and [[topographic]] distinct features, first in lower southern part, areal around the lake Blidinje, and another in northern higher part of the plateau where a flat plain Dugopolje is situated, as well as administratively between three municipalities: [[Posušje]], [[Tomislavgrad]] and [[Jablanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jablanica]]. 

Going from the north and the [[Doljanka River|Doljanka]] river, plateau opens with a flat plain of [[Dugopolje (Blidinje)|Dugopolje]] at the higher end and lead toward south longitudinally between [[Vran]] at the north-northwestern side, with its highest peak on 2.074 meters a.s.l., and on the south-southeastern [[Čvrsnica]] mountain, with its highest peak Pločno at 2.228 meters a.s.l. On the opposite south-southeastern end of the plateau, beyond Blidinje lake, is [[Čabulja]] mountain with its highest peak at 1.786 meters a.s.l. further toward east beyond Čvrsnica is [[Grabovica valley]] that stretches all the way to the [[Neretva]] river and its canyon.

=== Grabovica valley ===
[[Grabovica valley]] with small [[Grabovica creek]] is a special reserve within park, squeezed deep into Čvrsnica, and form a deep [[canyon]] between steep and rugged cliffs of the mountain. Within the valley are two small villages [[Gornja Grabovica (Jablanica)]] and [[Donja Grabovica (Jablanica)]]. The legend of [[Diva Grabovica]] tells the story about legendary daughter of a local [[shepherd]] who, as story goes, was killed by local [[nobleman]] whom she rejected, so that she would not marry another.&lt;ref name="NP-Blidinje-visitmycountry.net"/&gt;

=== Blidinje lake ===
The most important hydrogeological phenomena in the park is [[alpine lake]], [[Blidinje Lake]], largest of its kind in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
Blidinje lake is the direct result of a [[Glacial lake|glacial]] retreat, but according to the [[Poklečani Parishes]] office documents, [[lake]] is, also, a product of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] intervention and activities of human inhabitants. According to these documents, the lake is artificial and it was created at the end of the 19th century. In order to keep the water that is lost through the [[subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] passage, local residents and cattle breeders sealed sinkholes with branches and clay, so that water could not find its way underground. Therefore, the [[lake]] was formed. Its surface area varies between 2,5 and 6&amp;nbsp;km², while its average depth is 1,9 m, with altitude of 1.184 m a.s.l.&lt;ref name="history-Blidinje-lake-hrcak.srce.hr"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radoš|first=Denis|date=|title=A history of the occurrence of Blidinje lake (Bosnia and Herzegovina).|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/273866|journal=Geoadria|volume=22(1)|pages=1-40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NP-Blidinje-visitmycountry.net"/&gt;

[[File:Pinus heldreichii Orjen.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Pinus leucodermis]]]]

== Flora and fauna ==
Accompanying some of the rocky and seemingly lifeless slopes are thick forests of [[pine]], including the endemic white-bark pine at [[Masna Luka]] called [[Pinus leucodermis]] ''(Bosnian pine)''. Three types of wild [[thyme]] and dozens of wild flowers cover the valley and mountain sides in the spring and summer.

== History, archaeology and culture ==
All around the valley is dotted with the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] trademark '''''[[stećci]]''''' from [[medieval]] ages. It is not clear how long [[human settlements]] have existed here but research began when Blidinje recently received [[Nature park]] status. Traces of [[Illyria]]n graves and [[Roman road]]s indicate that Blidinje has been settled for at least 2,500 years. The large [[necropolis]] at Dugo Polje indicates that the waves of [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] that came in the 7th century also made this area their home.

=== Traditional life style ===
There is also a [[Franciscan]] [[monastery]] that is located within the park and open to visitors. Houses here are traditional shepherd homes with straw roofs that are mainly used during the spring and summer seasons. Winter is harsh and cold in these parts.

The park itself is free of mines with well-marked trails.

=== Trivia ===
A self-proclaimed [[micronation]], a parodical project, is located in the middle of this Nature Park, [[Hajdučka Republika Mijata Tomića]].

[[File:F. Bickerton looking out over seas near Commonwealth Bay.jpg|right|thumb|A photoprint of Commonwealth Bay, taken during the [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] in 1912.|alt=An onlooker looks out over an ice-covered bay in Antarctica.]]
'''Commonwealth Bay''' is an open [[Headlands and bays|bay]] about 48&amp;nbsp;km (30&amp;nbsp;mi) wide at the entrance between [[Point Alden]] and [[Cape Gray]] in [[Antarctica]]. It was discovered in 1912 by the [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] under [[Douglas Mawson]], who established the main base of the expedition at [[Cape Denison]] at the head of the bay. Named by Australasian Antarctic Expedition after the [[Commonwealth]] of [[Australia]].
[[File:Commonwealth Bay Antarctica.png|thumbnail|left|USGS satellite view of the Bay.]]

==Katabatic Wind==
The bay is listed in both the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' and the Eighth Edition of the ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] [[Atlas]]'' as the windiest place on Earth with winds regularly exceeding {{convert|240|km}} per hour and an average annual wind speed of {{convert|80|km}} per hour.

Storms are caused by [[katabatic wind]], a concentrated flow of cold air moving along the steep surface of the ice shield towards the sea.  The air flow is accelerated by the increasing gradient of the surface of ice and the cliff monolith at [[Cape Denison]]. In the summer there are periods of relative calm but during winter storms are especially strong and long lasting, and can start and end unexpectedly. An abrupt start and end of storm might be accompanied by powerful whirlpools and expressive short-lived and fast-moving clouds at the coast line.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first = F.K. |last = Ball |title = The Katabatic Winds of Adelie Land and King George V Land. |date = 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the extreme weather, the coast of Commonwealth Bay is an important breeding area for [[Antarctic petrel]]s, [[emperor penguin]]s, and [[Adelie penguin]]s which means that there are also [[Leopard seals]]

==Adelie penguin population crash==
The population of a colony of Adelie penguins here has crashed from 160,000 to 10,000, since 2011. A giant iceberg the size of Rome got stuck, and the colony is now effectively landlocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/13/150000-penguins-killed-after-giant-iceberg-renders-colony-landlocked|title=150,000 penguins die after giant iceberg renders colony landlocked|first=Bonnie|last=Malkin|date=13 February 2016|website=the Guardian|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/noinclude&gt;'''Environmental niche modelling''', alternatively known as '''species distribution modelling''', '''(ecological) niche modelling''', '''predictive habitat distribution modelling''', and '''climate envelope modelling''' refers to the process of using [[computer]] [[algorithm]]s to predict the distribution of species in [[geography|geographic]] space on the basis of a mathematical representation of their known distribution in [[Natural environment|environmental]] space (= realized [[ecological niche]]). The environment is in most cases represented by climate data (such as temperature, and precipitation), but other variables such as soil type, water depth, and land cover can also be used. These models allow for interpolating between a limited number of species occurrence and they are used in several research areas in [[conservation biology]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]].

The extent to which such modelled data reflect real-world species distributions will depend on a number of factors, including the nature, complexity, and accuracy of the models used and the quality of the available environmental data layers; the availability of sufficient and reliable species distribution data as model input; and the influence of various factors such as barriers to [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], geologic history, or [[biotic interaction]]s, that increase the difference between the [[realized niche]] and the fundamental niche. Environmental niche modelling may be considered a part of the discipline of [[biodiversity informatics]].

== Correlative vs mechanistic models ==
Environmental niche models are in origin correlative models. Given a handful of geographically-referred observed presences of a species and climate maps, they find the most likely environmental ranges where a species lives. For these algorithms to be effective, it is required to also gather observations of absences, that is, where the species does not live. Records of species absences are typically not as common as records of presences, thus often "random background" or "pseudo-absence" data are used to fit these models. Disagreement in the literature exists over whether environmental niche models portray the [[realized niche]], which is the environments where a species '''is''' found or the [[fundamental niche]], which is where a species '''can''' be found, that is, where the abiotic environment is appropriate for the survival of a species. If there are incomplete records of the occurrences of a species, there is a bias introduced by pseudo-absences, or the species is geographically confined due to dispersal limitations, environmental niche models might often reflect the [[realized niche]] instead of the [[fundamental niche]].

In contrast to correlative models, mechanistic (or process-based) models assess the bio-physiological aspects of a species to generate the conditions in which the species can ideally persist, based on observations made in controlled field or laboratory studies. As such it aims at modelling the fundamental niche of the species.

Niche modelling algorithms include "profile methods", simple statistical techniques that use e.g. environmental distance to known sites such as [http://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/publications/software/anuclim/doc/bioclim.html BIOCLIM],&lt;ref name="Nix1986a"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nix HA|year=1986|title=BIOCLIM — a Bioclimatic Analysis and Prediction System|journal=Research report, CSIRO Division of Water and Land Resources|volume=1983–1985|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nix1986b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nix HA|editor=Longmore|title=Atlas of Elapid Snakes of Australia. Australian Flora and Fauna Series 7|publisher=Bureau of Flora and Fauna, Canberra|year=1986|pages=4–15|chapter=A biogeographic analysis of Australian elapid snakes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DOMAIN; "regression" (e.g. forms of generalized linear models); and "[[machine learning]]" methods such as [[Principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy]] (MAXENT).  An incomplete list of algorithms that have been used for niche modelling includes:

===Profile techniques===
*[[BIOCLIM]]
*[[DOMAIN]]
*[[Ecological Niche Factor Analysis]] (ENFA)
*[[Mahalanobis distance]]

===Regression-based techniques===
*[[Generalized linear model]] (GLM)
*[[Generalized Additive Model]] (GAM)
*[[Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines]] (MARS)

===Machine learning techniques===
*[[MAXENT]]
*[[Artificial Neural Networks]] (ANN)
*[[Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production]] (GARP)
*[[Boosted Regression Trees]] (BRT)/Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
*[[Random Forest]] (RF)
*[[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM)

Furthermore, [[ensemble models]] can be created from several model outputs to create a model that captures components of each.  Often the mean or median value across several models is used as an ensemble.  Similarly, [[consensus models]] are models that fall closest to some measure of central tendency of all models—consensus models can be individual model runs or ensembles of several models.

== Niche modelling software ==
[[Image:Predicting habitats.png|right|300px|thumb|Example of simple niche modelling using rainfall, altitude and current species observations to create a model of possible existence for a certain species.]]

[https://adapt.nd.edu/groups/cem/wiki/SPACESTutorial SPACES] is an online Environmental niche modeling platform that allows users to design and run dozens of the most prominent algorithms in a high performance, multi-platform, browser-based environment.

[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/ MaxEnt] is the most widely used method/software uses presence only data and performs well when there are few presence records available.

[http://gis.ucmerced.edu/ModEco/ ModEco] implements various algorithms.

[[DIVA-GIS]] has an easy to use (and good for educational use) implementation of BIOCLIM

[http://www.bccvl.org.au/ The Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL)] is a "one stop modelling shop" that simplifies the process of biodiversity and climate impact modelling. It connects the research community to Australia’s national computational infrastructure by integrating a suite of tools in a coherent online environment. Users can access global climate and environmental datasets or upload their own data, perform data analysis across six different experiment types with a suite of 17 different algorithms, and easily visualise, interpret and evaluate the results of the models. Experiments types include: Species Distribution Model, Multispecies Distribution Model, Species Trait Model (currently under development), Climate Change Projection, Biodiverse Analysis and Ensemble Analysis. Example of BCCVL SDM outputs can be found [https://support.bccvl.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000127046-interpretation-of-model-outputs/ here]

Most niche modelling algorithms are available in the R packages [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/vignettes/sdm.pdf 'dismo'],  [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biomod2/index.html 'biomod2'] and [https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/mopa 'mopa']..

Software developers may want to build on the [http://openmodeller.sourceforge.net/ openModeller] project.

The Collaboratory for Adaptation to Climate Change [https://adapt.nd.edu adapt.nd.edu] has implemented an [https://adapt.nd.edu/groups/cem/wiki/OpenmodellerTutorial online version of openModeller] that allows users to design and run openModeller in a high-performance, browser-based environment to allow for multiple parallel experiments without the limitations of local processor power.

'''Fagne-Famenne''' is a [[natural region]] in southern [[Belgium]] and northern [[France]]. It consists of '''[[Fagne (natural region)|The Fagne]]''' or '''la Fagne''' west of the river [[Meuse]], and '''[[Famenne]]''' to the east. The two regions are often grouped together because they are quite similar both geographically and naturally.

'''GeoSUR''' is a regional initiative led by spatial data producers in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] to implement a regional geospatial network and to help establish the basis of a [[spatial data infrastructure]] in the region. GeoSUR supports the development of free access geographic services useful to find, view and analyze [[spatial information]] through [[map]]s, [[satellite images]], and [[geographic data]].

Participation in the network is open to any spatial data producer that is willing to place their geospatial information at the public's disposal and for the development of the region. Participation by institutions that generate useful information for decision making and development activities is emphasized.

The network is headed by CAF – the [[Development Bank of Latin America]] and the [[Pan-American Institute of Geography and History]] (PAIGH), with more than 90 regional and national institutions participating, among which the ministries of planning and public works, ministries of the environment, and geographic institutions of the region stand out as early adopters.

==History==

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the construction of some of the key technical components of a regional spatial data infrastructure has taken over 15 years of efforts by multiple players. Following are the key milestones of this process:
* The establishment of [[SIRGAS]] at the International Conference for the Definition of a Geocentric Reference System for South America, in Asuncion (Paraguay, 1993).
* The establishment of the [[Inter-American Geospatial Data Network]] (IGDN) in 1995. 
* The resolutions adopted by the four [[United Nations Regional Cartography Conferences for the Americas]]. 
* The resolution of February 2000 in [[Bogota, Colombia]], in which 21 American nations created the [[Permanent Committee for SDI in the Americas]] (CP-IDEA).
* The resolutions of the Consultation Meetings of the Cartography Commission of [[PAIGH]] in 2001 and 2005, and of PAIGH's 18th General Assembly (Venezuela, 2005).
* The declaration Development of Spatial Data Infrastructures in America by PAIGH's Executive Council,  issued in Bogota in 2007.
* The Inter-American Science and Technology Program of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) (Peru, 2003) which incorporated the Hemispheric Cooperation Initiative in the Field of Geographic Information for the Comprehensive Development of the Americas, and Resolution 2328 of the 37th General Assembly of the OAS (Panama, 2007). 
* The world conferences of the Association for the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure carried out in the region (Colombia, 2001; Chile, 2006, Trinidad and Tobago, 2008 and Canada, 2012).

The [[Geographic Information Network of Latin America and the Caribbean]] was launched in 2007, during PAIGH's annual meeting in Brasilia, it is supported by the GeoSUR Program, and aimed at the development of national and regional [[geoservices]] open to the public. During the first years of the Network's operation, diverse regional geoservices were developed and staged on the web, and the participation of a large number of national institutions was consolidated. From a cradle of around 10 agencies in 2007, GeoSUR grew exponentially and managed to incorporate more than 80 new agencies in the following six years.

In 2012, in the framework of the 44th Meeting of PAIGH's Executive Board, which took place in Buenos Aires, a document was subscribed with the purpose of strengthening, harmonizing, and accelerating the development of the spatial data infrastructures of the Americas in a coordinated and effective manner. The document was subscribed by representatives from CAF (GeoSUR Program), PAIGH, SIRGAS, and GGIM Americas.

Toward the end of 2013, more than 90 institutions from 24 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean participated in the Program. These institutions provide geographic information which is useful for the planners of the region, using modern technologies to manage geo-information, spatial data infrastructures, and several geospatial components.

== GeoSUR Architecture ==

The Network's architecture is ruled by the basic guidelines for the development of geoservices defined for the spatial data infrastructures (SDI), it is decentralized, and it is based on the use of OGC and ISO standards and protocols that enable interoperability between the different nodes and components that make up the Network.

The Network's regional geoservices are operated and maintained by CAF and PAIGH, with support from the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS). Most of the geoservices with national, sub-national, and urban datasets are maintained and operated directly by the participating institutions.

The GeoSUR Platform is made up of five components:

* The Latin America and Caribbean Regional Portal
* The Regional Map Service
* The Regional Topographic Processing Service 
* A network of geoservices 
* The Online [[ArcGIS]] Regional Portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Eric van Praag |author2=Santiago Borrero |author3=Rubén Vargas |title=A Regional  Initiative to Integrate and Disseminate Spatial Data in Latin America and the Caribbean|journal=A Regional Initiative to Integrate and Disseminate Spatial Data in Latin America and the Caribbean|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Praag|first=Eric|title=¿Cómo es la estructura del GeoSUR y cuáles son las acciones del Programa para promocionar las tecnologías geoespaciales en Latinoamérica y el Caribe?|url=http://www.ipgh.org/GeoSUR/files/Entrevista-MundoGeo_(V-libre-espanol).pdf|accessdate=10 November 2013|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015721/http://www.ipgh.org/GeoSUR/files/Entrevista-MundoGeo_(V-libre-espanol).pdf|archive-date=2013-12-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

===1. The Latin America and Caribbean Regional Portal===

With the support of the [[USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center]] (EROS), GeoSUR developed the first regional portal for Latin America and the Caribbean in March 2007. The portal offers free access to an important collection of regional geospatial information, it contains detailed descriptions of thousands of spatial datasets, and connects the user to a great variety of maps and geographic services operated and maintained by participating institutions from 24 countries.

The Portal has a complete data base of [[metadata]] that describes the spatial data that have been developed by the participating institutions. This data base is connected to similar catalogues operated by these institutions and is periodically updated through an automatic metadata collection mechanism. The Portal has more than 13,000 metadata records in its central data base, and offers access, through a search mechanism, to more than 500,000 metadata records found in other catalogues. The GeoSUR Portal also provided access to a regional map viewer and a topographic processing service that will be described further on.

The Portal was developed with ESRI's Geoportal Server and uses the Joomla content management system.

=== 2. The Map Regional Service ===

This spatial data visualization service was designed by CAF and it was developed and it is hosted by EROS. The service contains information on supranational maps generated by third party institutions, and it offers access to national and local maps available in viewers operated by participating institutions. Most of the supranational information is public and is available for free download. The service has been in operation since January 2008 and it was built with ArcGIS Server 10.1. The service viewer was built using Flex technology.

The viewer also provides access to more than 10,000 digital maps contained in more than 350 OGC-based geoservices operated by participating institutions, integrates GeoRSS data, provides tools to evaluate the impact of infrastructure projects on-line and to derive data from digital elevation models, among others.

As part of a project advanced by CAF and the Dartmouth Flood Observatory of the University of Colorado, daily regional flood maps in near-real-time and historical maps of flood are being incorporated to the viewer. Also, a system to estimate daily river flow in more than 2,000 river points in the region is being implemented using [[remote sensing]] techniques.

Institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[Andean Community]], the [[World Resources Institute]], [[Nature Serve]], [[Conservation International]], [[NASA]], the USGS, [[Woods Hole]], the University of Colorado, the University of Buffalo, the University of Maryland, Guyra Paraguay, the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID), the Department of the Interior in the US, the US Forest Service, the Lincoln Institute, and the geographic institutes of Mesoamerica have contributed regional spatial data which is available at the Regional Map Service.

To date, the viewer has more than 700 regional maps, among which the following stand out:
* near-real-time daily flood maps and historic flood maps of Colorado University,
* biodiversity data from the North Andean area of the Nature Serve, 
* coral reef maps of the Caribbean islands from the World Resources 
* maps of Central American ecosystems from the World Bank and of Andean ecosystems from the Andean Community, 
* mangrove maps of South America of the USGS.
* biomass and height of forest tree tops data from NASA, 
* monthly deforestation maps of the Gran Chaco Americano,
* Change in forest cover from 2000 to 2010 in the region,
* Land use/cover of Latin America from the European Spatial Agency, 
* climate maps from Worldclim, 
* hydropower potential of selected regions of South America,
* geology maps of South America from the OneGeology initiative, 
* maps of mineral resources and flood maps from the USGS,
* and land use/cover maps for the Caribbean islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Eric van Praag |author2=Santiago Borrero |author3=Rubén Vargas |title=A Regional Initiative to Integrate and Disseminate Spatial Data in Latin America and the Caribbean|journal=A Regional Initiative to Integrate and Disseminate Spatial Data in Latin America and the Caribbean|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3. The Regional Topographic Processing Service ===

GeoSUR developed a free access Topographic Processing Service (TPS) which is available on the web and allows for the generation of data derived from [[digital elevation model]]s (DEMs) of Latin America and the Caribbean. Users may execute the computer models available in this service by using a varied set of DEMs with 1&amp;nbsp;km., and 500, 250, 90, and 30 meter resolutions. The models available in the TPS include: elevation profile, classification of slopes, watershed delineation, shaded relief, elevation classifications, aspect, viewshed analysis, dam flood areas and rain drop, among others. Users may select and download the DEM of any area of interest in Latin America and the Caribbean (with the exception of the 30 meter DEM) from the TPS.

EROS filled the information gaps of the DEM generated by the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]] (SRTM, resolution: 30 meters) with [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]], GDEM and [[GTOPO30]] data for all the Latin American and Caribbean region, and created derived and consistent maps for the region which include shaded relief, slope, and aspect, and which may be visualized and downloaded from the Regional Maps Service.

Access to the SRTM 30-meter DEM of Latin America and the Caribbean has allowed CAF, with the support of CAF's Energy Program and some ministries of energy, to carry out detailed assessments of the hydroelectric potential of the State of São Paulo, Peru and Bolivia (the power potential of each 1&amp;nbsp;km. segment of river is calculated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Development Bank of Latin America|title=Servicio Procesamiento Topografico|url=http://www.geosur.info/geosur/contents/TPSManual%20Spanish.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 4. The geoservices network operated by participating institutions ===
The Regional Map Service described above basically contains regional information. The national and local geospatial information for the region is available through a decentralized network of map services operated by participating institutions, where each institution is committed to the development of map services and metadata catalogues under the standards of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC). The participants act as data editors and have accounts in the GeoSUR Portal which allows them to register and manage their geoservices.

The participating institutions have the liberty to choose the hardware and software platforms to share data with the Network, under the condition that they use regionally recognized standards.

Currently, the GeoSUR Portal offers access to more than 100 viewers, more than 350 [[WMS service]]s, and more than 40 WFS services. It offers access to more than 10,000 digital maps available in geoservices operated by participating institutions. GeoSUR offers capacity-building, technical assistance, and support to the institutions that are planning - or in the process of developing - their geoservices, and also helps stage some of them to the Cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mayer-Schonberger, V; Lazer, D (Ed)|title=Governance and Information Technology: from Electronic Government to Information Government.

===5. The Regional Portal in ArcGIS Online===
During 2013, it was decided to complement the information and services offered in the GeoSUR Portal by launching a Regional Portal based on ESRI's ArcGIS Online. Through this Portal, access is offered to part of the information included in the www.geosur.info Portal in a more user friendly platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ArcGIS Online Website|url=http://geosur.maps.arcgis.com/home/|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The GeoSUR Award ==

The GeoSUR Award is granted annually and recognizes the application of spatial data and the development of geospatial information services which, due to their innovative and relevant characteristics, contribute to the fulfillment of the general objectives of the GeoSUR Program and promote the use of geographic information for decision making in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Institutions or individuals from any country in the region may apply for the award. The bases of the award are announced at the beginning of each year in the PAIGH and GeoSUR websites.

The GeoSUR 2012 Award for innovation was granted to the Project for the Integration of geospatial Data for Mesoamerica, presented by the National Geographic and Land Registry Institute of El Salvador; while that year's award for relevance corresponded to the Geoserver of the Ministry of the Environment of Peru.

The GeoSUR 2013 Award was granted to the Project “Terra-i, a system that monitors natural vegetation change in Latin America and the Caribbean in real time, presented by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). Two projects were awarded honorable mention: the “Computer platform for the development of motoring, analysis, and alert systems for environmental extremes”, presented by the National Institute for Spatial Research (INPE) in Brazil, and the “Registry System for Geographic Items” presented by the Spatial Data Infrastructure for Bogota (IDECA).

[[Image:Burundi Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Burundi]]
'''Burundi''' is located in central Africa, to the east of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], at the co-ordinates {{coord|3|30|S|30|0|E|}}.

==Physical geography==
[[Burundi]] occupies an area equal to {{convert|27830|km2}}  in size, of which {{convert|25680|km2}} is land.  The country has {{convert|1140|km}} of land border: {{convert|236|km}} of which is shared with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, {{convert|315|km}} with [[Rwanda]] and {{convert|589|km}} with [[Tanzania]].  As a landlocked country, Burundi possesses no coastline. It straddles the crest of the [[Congo-Nile Divide]] which separates the basins of the [[Congo River|Congo]] and [[Nile]] rivers. The farthest headwaters of the Nile, the [[Ruvyironza River]], has its source in Burundi.

===Climate===
Burundi in general has a tropical highland climate, with a considerable daily temperature range in many areas. Temperature also varies considerably from one region to another, chiefly as a result of differences in altitude. The central plateau enjoys pleasantly cool weather, with an average temperature of {{convert|20|°C}}. The area around [[Lake Tanganyika]] is warmer, averaging {{convert|23|°C|1}}; the highest mountain areas are cooler, averaging {{convert|16|°C|1}}. [[Bujumbura]]’s average annual temperature is {{convert|23|°C|1}}. Rain is irregular, falling most heavily in the northwest. Dry seasons vary in length, and there are sometimes long periods of drought. However, four seasons can be distinguished: the long dry season (June–August), the short wet season (September–November), the short dry season (December–January), and the long wet season (February–May). Most of Burundi receives between {{convert|1300|and|1600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall a year. The [[Ruzizi Plain]] and the northeast receive between {{convert|750|and|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}

===Terrain===
[[File:Haut plateau.jpg|thumb|left|Plateau of Burundi]]
The terrain of Burundi is hilly and mountainous, dropping to a plateau in the east.  The southern and eastern [[plain]]s have been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as part of the [[Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion.

The lowest point in the country is at [[Lake Tanganyika]], at {{convert|772|m}}, with the highest point being on [[Mount Heha]], at {{convert|2684|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countriesquest.com/africa/burundi/land_and_resources.htm Burundi, land and resources]&lt;/ref&gt; Natural hazards are posed in Burundi by flooding and landslides.

===Natural resources===
Burundi possesses reserves of: [[nickel]], [[uranium]], rare earth oxides, [[peat]], [[cobalt]], copper, [[platinum]] (not yet exploited), [[vanadium]], [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], gold, [[tin]], [[tungsten]], [[kaolin]], and [[limestone]].  There is also arable land and the potential for hydropower.  Burundi has {{convert|214.3|km2}} of land that is irrigated.  The table below describes land use in Burundi.

! Use !! Percentage of Area
|-
! arable land
| 42.83
|-
! permanent crops
| 13.63
|-
! other
| 43.54
|-
|}

==Environment==
===Current issues===
Soil erosion is an issue for Burundi, and is as a result of overgrazing and the expansion of agriculture into marginal lands.  Other issues include: deforestation, due to the uncontrolled cutting-down of trees for fuel; and habitat loss threatens wildlife populations.

===International agreements===
Burundi is a party to the following international agreements that relate to the environment: Biodiversity, Climate Change, [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes and Ozone Layer Protection.  The following have been signed but not yet ratified by Burundi: Law of the Sea and Nuclear Test Ban.

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Burundi]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Rwanda]] immediately south of the Rwandna town of [[Mbuye]], Muyinga Province
* Easternmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Tanzania]] immediately northwest of [[Mburi hill]], Cankuzo Province
* Southernmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Tanzania]] immediately north of the Tanzanian town of [[Mwenene]], Makamba Province
* Westernmost point – unnamed location on the border the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] immediately east of the Congolese town of [[Kamanyola]], Cibitoke Province

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6665">The '''geology of Latvia''' includes an ancient [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]] crystalline basement overlain with [[Neoproterozoic]] volcanic rocks and numerous sedimentary rock sequences from the [[Paleozoic]], some from the [[Mesozoic]] and many from the recent [[Quaternary]] past. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=500-505}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]]  is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe.

==Geologic History, Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
Several hundred boreholes have returned data about the [[Precambrian]] crystalline basement of Latvia, indicating young Middle Proterozoic intrusive rocks such as 1.65 billion year old rapakivi granite or 1.82 billion year old [[granodiorite]] in the northeast. Most basement probably formed before the Svecofennian orogeny, between the [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]]. 

The Valmiera-Lokno Rise has early Archean [[amphibolite]], [[gneiss]], [[granitoid]] and [[migmatite]] under the east of Latvia, although metavolcanics, [[granulite]] gneiss and magnetite-bearing [[quartzite]] are most common in the Riga Megablock. The Garsene-Limbazi megablock has steeply dipping amphibolite, [[epidote]] amphibolite, plagiogneiss, migmatite granite, magnetite-rich quartzite (in the south) from the Proterozoic. Low-grade metavolcanics and 1.8 billion year old granodiorites cover the Riga Megablock in the Adazi assemblage. The Riga Pluton (or Kurzeme Pluton) is a large intrusion from 1.65 billion years ago with gabbro, [[anorthosite]] and rapakivi granite, covered in unmetamorphosed Pavilosta Formation volcanics along the west coast. 

[[Mesoproterozoic]] rocks are separated from the [[Neoproterozoic]] by an erosion horizon. In western Latvia, basalt, gabbro-[[norite]] dikes, tuff, sand and gravel (sediments in the Zuru beds), [[limburgite]] and basaltic [[picrate]] are particularly common. The Valdai Group holds extensive siltstone, sandstone and clay from the Neoproterozoic. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=500}}

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
[[Cambrian]] rocks trace the Precambrian subsurface and the oldest, 50 to 130 meters thick are found in the east, including shale, argillite and sandstone. Fossil evidence indicates they correlate with the Cambrian Blue Shale in Estonia, early and middle Cambrian rocks in the west are about 220 meters thick. Upper parts of the lower section have brown [[oolite]] iron ore in argillite with a thickness of up to five meters and some rocks in the west host small amounts of oil.
 
Except in the north-center of the country, [[Ordovician]] rocks are everywhere in the subsurface and include argillite, shale and limestone about 250 meters thick at an average depth of 1.7 kilometers below sea level. 

A disconformity separates [[Silurian]] rocks from Ordovician rocks and they are common in the subsurface, about 950 meters deep in the west or 162 meters in the north. Most are carbonates with 23 different known [[graptolite]] zones.
 
Since the late 19th century, researchers have often focused on widespread [[Devonian]] rocks up to 900 meters thick that often directly underlie Quaternary deposits and outcrop along streams. Early Devonian rocks are 250 meters thick including siltstone, shale, sandstone, clay and [[ostracoderm]] fossils. Middle Devonian rocks have a shift toward [[argillite]] and [[gypsum]] and gypsum is quarried in Salaspils-Sauriesli between Ogre and Riga. Famenninan Stage dolostone and siltstone is up to 140 meters thick, overlain by [[Frasnian]] dolostone, quarried in the east for us ceramics. 

[[Carboniferous]] rocks are limited to the southwest, with [[Tournasian]] age dolomitic sandstone, dolostone, sandstone and siltstone 104 meters thick. 

Permian rocks are also confined to the southwest, with a significant disconformity from underlying Carboniferous rocks. Permian rocks from the [[Kazanian]] are 35 meters thick with carbonate shale, dolostone, limestone and sandstone. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=500-503}}

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
Only small areas in the southwest have [[Triassic]] rocks, including 74 meters of carbonate clays, sandstone and siltstone. Jurassic rocks are also confined to the southwest and are thinner at only 27 meters and include clay, quartz sands, sandstone, lignite, and siltstone with foraminifera fossils. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=502}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
[[Cenozoic]] units are largely absent in Latvia, except from the past 2.5  million years of the [[Quaternary]], which cover the entire country, except where wave erosion has stripped them away on the east-central shore of the Gulf of Riga (or in some river valleys). In buried valleys, these sediments can be up to 310 meters thick, although the average thickness is up to 20 meters in lowlands 40 to 60 meters in highlands. Between Cesis and Madona and in the Vidzeme Highland in south-central part of the country, thicknesses can reach up to 200 meters. The Latgale Formation includes Precambrian crystalline clasts and gray clay left over from the first [[Pleistocene]] glaciation. Zidini Formation  interglacial lakebed sediments overlie the Latgale up to 23.5 meters thick.
 
The overlying Letiza Formation correlates with formations such as the Oka in Russia or Sangaste in Estonia, associated with the Elsterian glaciation and includes till atop Jurassic rock. Eight meters of lacustrine sediment in the Pulvernieki or marine clays in the Akmenrags Formation line up with the mid-Pleistocene Holsteinian glaciation. Along the Baltic coast, up to 60 meters of brackish sand—the Jurkalne Member—overlies the Akmenrags Formation. The Kurzeme Formation gray calcareous material is widespread, left from the most extensive period of glaciation. The last interglacial is marked by the Felicianova Formation alluvium, overlain by Baltic group sediments from the last glacial advance.
 
Glacial retreat and oscillation took place from 25,000 to 12,000 years ago, leaving the 90 meter Latvia Formation, including the Jelgava Member lacustrine deposits. Major spillways drained the landscape, emptying the Baltic Ice Lake which flooded much of the region. The Yoldia Sea, Ancillus Lake, Littorina Sea and Limnea Sea all existed during the early [[Holocene]], leaving behind shoreline deposits. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=503}}

A '''position representation''' is the parameters used to express a position relative to a reference. Representing position in three dimensions is often done by a [[Euclidean vector]]. However, when representing position relative to the [[Earth]] it is often more convenient to represent vertical position as [[altitude]] or depth, and to use some other parameters to represent '''horizontal position'''. There are also several applications where only the horizontal position is of interest, this might e.g. be the case for ships and ground vehicles/cars.

There are several options for horizontal position representations, each with different properties which makes them appropriate for different applications. [[Latitude]]/[[longitude]] and [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] are common horizontal position representations.

The horizontal position has two [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], and thus two parameters are sufficient to uniquely describe such a position. However, similarly to the use of [[Euler angles]] as a [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|formalism for representing rotations]], using only the minimum number of parameters gives [[mathematical singularity|singularities]], and thus three parameters are required for the horizontal position to avoid this.

==Latitude and longitude==
{{Main|Latitude|Longitude}}

The most common horizontal position representation is [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. The parameters are intuitive and well known, and are thus suited for communicating a position to humans, e.g. using a position plot.

However, latitude and longitude should be used with care in mathematical expressions (including calculations in computer programs). The main reason is the [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] at the [[Geographical pole|Poles]], which makes longitude undefined at these points. Also near the poles the latitude/longitude grid is highly non-linear, and several errors may occur in calculations that are sufficiently accurate on other locations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gade |first1= Kenneth |year= 2010 |title= A non-singular horizontal position representation |journal= The Journal of Navigation |publisher= Cambridge University Press |volume= 63 |issue= 3 |pages=395–417 |url=http://www.navlab.net/Publications/A_Nonsingular_Horizontal_Position_Representation.pdf| format=PDF |doi= 10.1017/S0373463309990415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problematic area is the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] at ±[[180th meridian|180°]] longitude, where the longitude has a [[Discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]], and hence specific program code must often be written to handle this. An example of the consequences of omitting such code is the crash of the navigation systems of twelve [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter aircraft while crossing this meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.itnews.com.au/News/74081,stealth-fighters-hit-by-software-crash.aspx |title=Stealth fighters hit by software crash |date=27 February 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''n''-vector==
{{Main|n-vector}}

[[n-vector|''n''-vector]] is a three parameter [[mathematical singularity|non-singular]] horizontal position representation that can replace latitude and longitude. Geometrically, it is a [[unit vector]] which is normal to the [[reference ellipsoid]]. The vector is [[Vector decomposition|decomposed]] in an [[ECEF|Earth centered earth fixed]] [[coordinate system]]. It behaves the same at all Earth positions, and it holds the mathematical [[Injective function|one-to-one]] property. The vector formulation makes it possible to use standard 3D [[Vector calculus|vector algebra]], and thus ''n''-vector is well-suited for mathematical calculations, e.g. adding, subtracting, interpolating and averaging positions.

Using three parameters, ''n''-vector is inconvenient for communicating a position directly to humans and before showing a position plot, a [[n-vector#Converting n-vector to latitude/longitude|conversion to latitude/longitude]] might be needed.

==Local flat Earth assumption==
When carrying out several calculations within a limited area, a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] might be defined with the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] at a specified Earth-fixed position. The origin is often selected at the surface of the reference ellipsoid, with the ''z''-axis in the vertical direction. Hence (three dimensional) position vectors relative to this coordinate frame will have two horizontal and one vertical parameter. The axes are typically selected as [[North East Down|North-East-Down]] or [[East North Up|East-North-Up]], and thus this system can be viewed as a [[linearization]] of the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] and [[Circle of latitude|parallels]].

For small areas a local coordinate system can be convenient for relative positioning, but with increasing (horizontal) distances, errors will increase and repositioning of the [[tangent point]] may be required. The alignment along the north and east directions is not possible at the [[Geographical pole|Poles]], and near the Poles these directions might have significant errors (here the linearization is valid only in a very small area).

==UTM==
{{Main| Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system}}
Instead of one local Cartesian grid, that needs to be repositioned as the position of interest moves, a fixed set of [[map projections]] covering the Earth can be defined. [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] is one such system, dividing the Earth into 60 longitude zones (and with [[Universal Polar Stereographic coordinate system|UPS]] covering the [[Polar regions]]).

UTM is widely used, and the coordinates approximately corresponds to meters north and east. However, as a set of map-projections it has inherent [[distortions]], and thus most calculations based on UTM will not be exact. The crossing of zones gives additional complexity.

==Comparison==
When deciding which parameters to use for representing position in a specific application, there are several properties that should be considered. The following table gives a summary of what to consider.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Comparison of horizontal position representations
|-
! Representation !! Pros!! Cons
|-
| [[Latitude]] and [[longitude]]
||
* Widely used
* Parameters are easy to recognize by humans (well-suited for plotting)
||
* [[Mathematical singularity|Singularities]] at the [[Geographical pole|Poles]]
* Complex behavior near the Poles
* Discontinuity at the ±[[180th meridian|180° meridian]]
|-
| [[n-vector|''n''-vector]]
||
* [[Mathematical singularity|Nonsingular]]
* Efficient in equations/calculations since standard 3D [[Vector calculus|vector algebra]] can be used
* All Earth positions are treated equally
||
* Inconvenient for communicating a position to humans
* Uses three parameters
|-
| Local [[Cartesian coordinate system]]
||
* Cartesian vectors in meters along the directions of north, east and down are obtained
||
* Can only be used for relative positioning (the tangent point must be represented by some other quantity)
* Errors increase with increasing horizontal distance from the tangent point (which may require repositioning of the tangent point)
* North and east directions are undefined at the Poles, and near the Poles these directions may change significantly within the area of interest
|-
| [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]]
||
* Widely used
* Approximate north and east directions
* One unit corresponds approximately to one meter
||
* Inherent [[distortion]] (due to the [[map projection]]) gives only approximate answers for most calculations
* Calculations get complex when crossing the zones
* The [[Polar Regions]] are not covered

The '''iGO''' Navigation Engine, developed by [[Hungary]]-based [[NNG (company)|NNG]] LLC (formerly Nav N Go) is a [[GPS navigation software]] package. NNG sells some versions of the software directly to users, as well as to device manufacturers, auto makers, network operators and professional transport specialists. Products based on iGO are available in brands including [[Harman Kardon|Becker]], [[Clarion (car audio)|Clarion]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Samsung]] and [[Vodafone]].&lt;ref name="references"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nng.com/who-we-are/about-the-company/references |title=References |publisher=Nng.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214172957/http://www.nng.com/who-we-are/about-the-company/references |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product history ==
iGO My way 2006 was the first GPS navigation software package by Nav N Go (now NNG) for [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]/[[personal navigation assistant|PNA]] devices, introduced in 2005 at [[CeBIT]], Hannover.&lt;ref name="Story"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nng.com/who-we-are/about-the-company/company-overview |title=The NNG Story |publisher=Nng.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214174358/http://www.nng.com/who-we-are/about-the-company/company-overview |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the new map compression technology, the product fits on a 1GB [[SD card]]. An improved version was iGO My way 2006 Plus, announced in 2006.

NNG's iGO 8 (for PDA/PNA devices) was released in April 2008. It offered high-definition 3D navigation maps of terrain, road elevation, landmarks and 3D buildings.&lt;ref name="iGO 8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsbusinessnews.com/Nav-N-Go-iGO-8-available-for-Windows-smartphones-in-Europe_a852.html |title=Nav N Go iGO 8 available for Windows smartphones in Europe |publisher=Gpsbusinessnews.com |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iGO amigo (for PNDs) was launched at [[CeBIT]] 2009 in [[Hannover]].&lt;ref name="iGO amigo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cedailynews.com/2009/03/igo-amigo-launched-at-cebit-2009.html |title=iGO amigo Launched at CeBIT 2009 |publisher=Cedailynews.com |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2013-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214171924/http://www.cedailynews.com/2009/03/igo-amigo-launched-at-cebit-2009.html |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; iGO amigo was the first in a new software series, and employed changes aimed at simplifying the [[user interface]]. Since iGO amigo was a streamlined release, it had fewer features than its predecessor iGO 8.&lt;ref name="iGO amigo Overview"&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Morley |url=http://www.pocketgpsworld.com/igo-amigo-review-f5165.php |title=Nav N Go iGO Amigo Review |publisher=Pocketgpsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iGO My Way 2009 (for iOS devices) was released for North America and Western Europe and was then rolled out to all of Europe in 2010.&lt;ref name="iGo My way"&gt;[http://www.igomyway.com/iphone/en/products.html iGO My way for iPhone] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103032200/http://www.igomyway.com/iphone/en/products.html |date=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

iGO Primo (for Apple iOS, PND/PNA devices), introduced in 2010, is {{As of|2015|lc=y}} the primary product of the iGO Navigation range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://navngo.com/pages/global/eng/news_and_press/igo_primo_cebit_eng_20100301 |title=Nav N Go Launches Premium Navigation Software: iGO primo |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303235016/http://navngo.com/pages/global/eng/news_and_press/igo_primo_cebit_eng_20100301 |archivedate=3 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 6 was introduced at the end of 2012, with [[Google Local]] search, green routing,{{clarify|date=April 2013}} extras through in-app purchase, real-time traffic monitoring, TTS Pro [[speech synthesis]], and 3D display of junctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igonavigation.com/igo-my-way-for-iphone |title=iGO primo Key Features |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411063809/http://www.igonavigation.com/igo-my-way-for-iphone |archivedate=2013-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

iGO Primo app for [[iOS]] devices was introduced at [[CeBIT]] Hannover, 2011. Running on the iGO primo software engine, the refreshed application covers 115 countries with location-based search, green routing and improved junction views. [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Windows Mobile]] versions are available to [[smartphone]] manufacturers and network providers, but not for retail sale.

== Naviextras ==
Naviextras.com, NNG's map and content update portal, provides updates for iGO 8, iGO amigo and iGO primo. The portal typically releases map updates four times a year. Maps and updates are available for over 90 countries and regions, including countries from Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Middle East, Asia, and Oceania. In 2013, the portal supports 5.200 devices and counts close to 1.8 million registered users globally.&lt;ref name="naviextras"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naviextras.com/ |title=naviextras.com |publisher=naviextras.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As NNG is an independent map provider, it works with several map suppliers in different geographical regions. There are different versions of maps running on the iGO Navigation software for the same country or region made by different map suppliers, including [[TomTom]], [[Here (company)|HERE]], Sensis  and regional providers.

== Partnerships ==
In 2013, NNG partnered with Logicom, with an intention to provide the iGO navigation software services to the latter's mappy PNDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/logicom-reunites-with-nng/|title=Logicom Reunites with NNG - Automotive World|website=www.automotiveworld.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://telematicsnews.info/2013/06/26/logicom-reunites-with-nng_j4253/|title=NNG to supply iGO navigation software for Logicom Mappy units|date=2013-06-26|work=Telematics News|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Social Science Council''' ('''ISSC''') was an international organisation promoting the [[social sciences|social sciences, including the economic and behavioural sciences]].  It was founded in 1952, under the auspices of [[UNESCO]]. 6-9 Oct 1952, Paris (France), following a Resolution at the 6th UNESCO General Conference in 1951. Statutes: adopted 19 Sep 1972; completed and revised 14 Nov 1979; revised: 17 Dec 1985; 3 Dec 1992; 27 Nov 1998; 8 Nov 2006; 10 Dec 2010. Registered in accordance with French Law.

In 2018 the ISSC merged with the [[International Council for Science|International Council for Science (ICSU)]] to create the [[International Science Council]].

==Mission==
The mission of the ISSC was to advance the social sciences - their quality, novelty and utility - in all parts of the world: 
* To advance social science research across national and regional boundaries; 
* To support social science capacity building, particularly in countries and regions where it is currently not well developed; 
* To provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, analysis and dissemination of data on social science resources, their availability for research and their impact on society; * To broaden interdisciplinary collaboration among the social sciences; 
* To expand exchange and joint work between the social sciences, the humanities and other sciences; * To link social science knowledge effectively to public policies and local needs in order to improve the quality of people's lives; 
* To promote the social science literacy of citizens.

The activities of the Council were guided by the principles of academic freedom, pursuit of excellence, equitable access to scientific information and data, unfettered conduct of science, open communication and transparency, accountability, and the use of knowledge for societal value. In addition, the Council sought to support the participation of women, minorities and others under-represented in social science research.

==Governance and structure==
The ISSC was governed by a General Assembly, comprising the Council’s membership. The General Assembly met every three years to review the Council’s activities and determine the general direction of its future work.

The ISSC Executive Committee was elected by the General Assembly and acted as the Council’s governing body. It consisted of the President, two Vice-Presidents and a Treasurer, as well as ten further members (Ordinary Members). 

The General Assembly, on recommendation of the Executive Committee, approved the appointment of the Executive Director, who headed the Council’s Secretariat, and served as an ex-officio member of the Executive Committee and of all appointed (standing or ad hoc) committees of the ISSC.

The Council was advised and guided by individuals from around the world who volunteered their time to serve on various ISSC Committees and Working Groups.

==Activities==
The ISSC led a number of flagship activities and was a partner on many collaborative initiatives.

===World Social Science Report===
The ISSC produced the World Social Science Report every three years, as part of its strategic partnership with [[UNESCO]]. The reports aim to address important social science challenges, take stock of social science contributions and capacities, and to make recommendations for future research, practice and policy.

* The World Social Science Report 2010: Knowledge Divides was prepared by the ISSC and published by UNESCO in June 2010. It reviewed social science knowledge production and use in different regions of the world and assessed how the social sciences are evolving in the face of unequal conditions and diverging trends.
* The World Social Science Report 2013: Changing Global Environments was prepared by the ISSC and co-published with UNESCO and the [[OECD]]. It was launched at UNESCO in Paris in November 2013.
* The World Social Science Report 2016: Challenging Inequalities – Pathways to a Just World was prepared by the ISSC in collaboration with the [[Institute of Development Studies|Institute of Development Studies (IDS)]], and co-published with UNESCO. It was launched in Stockholm on September 22 2016.

===World Social Science Forum===
The ISSC convened the World Social Science Forum. These events gather researchers, funders, policymakers, and other stakeholders to debate topics of global significance and to determine future priorities for international social science. 

* The ISSC convened the first ever World Social Science Forum in Bergen, Norway, 10-12 May 2009, on the topic 'One planet - worlds apart?'
* The second World Social Science Forum, 'Social Transformations and the Digital Age', took place in Montreal, Canada, in October 2013.
* The third World Social Science Forum, 'Transforming Global Relations for a Just World', took place in Durban, South Africa, 13-16 September 2015.
* The fourth World Social Science Forum will take place in Fukuoka, Japan, in September 2018. The theme is 'Security and Equality for Sustainable Futures'.

===Transformations to Sustainability===
Transformations to Sustainability (T2S) is a research programme supporting social-science-led research on social transformations to greater sustainability. The programme is funded by the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)]] and has supported 38 seed projects (September 2014 to March 2015) and three Transformative Knowledge Networks (December 2015 to December 2018). The programme aims to build on the networks of knowledge gathered through the seed projects and Transformative Knowledge Networks to create and leave behind a lasting global knowledge base. 

The Transformations to Sustainability programme contributes to [[Future Earth]].

===Programmes and networks===
The ISSC initiated and supported several international research programmes with the objective of fostering comparative, interdisciplinary research by setting up networks of social scientists from different disciplines and regions of the world.The ISSC co-sponsored a number of international research programmes and networks around various themes, such as the environment, disaster risk, poverty and gender. These initiatives were undertaken in partnership with various partners and other organisations around the world.

* [[Future Earth]]
* [[International Human Dimensions Programme]]
* [http://www.irdrinternational.org/ Integrated Research on Disaster Risk]
* [http://www.csun.edu/~isscggd/ Gender, Globalisation and Democratisation Network]

===Prizes===
The ISSC awarded two prestigious international prizes: the [[Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research]] and the Foundation Mattei Dogan Prize for Excellence in Interdisciplinary Research.

Nominations for the prize were made by ISSC members or other professional associations in various disciplines, as well as by universities and academic institutions. The selection of a winner is made by an international jury of scholars.

===World Social Science Fellows===
From 2012 to 2015 the ISSC led the World Social Science Fellows programme, an international scientific programme to support early-career researchers in the social sciences, with the aim of fostering a new generation of globally-networked research leaders who will collaborate in addressing global problems with particular relevance for low and middle income countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">'''John Lodge Cowley''' (1719, [[United Kingdom]] – buried 1797, United Kingdom) was an [[English people|English]] [[cartographer]], [[geologist]] and [[mathematician]].

John Cowley was a professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], [[London]], for a number of years between 1761 and 1773. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in April, 1768.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27cowley%27%29|title=Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|accessdate=2010-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mathematical methods were famous, but he was also an important geographer as well as Cartographer Royal to [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. He specialised in maps that depicted the [[counties of the United Kingdom]] from which arose his most famous work, ''Counties of England''. Cowley published several maps, many of minute detail, and on them often appeared his name although on others appeared the name of [[Emanuel Bowen]] acting as engraver. Another one of his works of some note, but less famous than ''The Counties'', was ''A new and easy introduction to the study of geography'' which was published by Thomas Cox and James Hodges. The work was structured as questions and answers with decorative maps added later. His maps contained longer titles than those usually found on the standard miniature maps. John Cowley collaborated with [[Robert Dodsley]] for several years in the creation of his maps which explains why the maps were ascribed to Dodsley/Cowley. Among his works are remembered the superb engravings representing the constellation drawn on glass globes created by Thomas Heath.

He also published a number of introductory works on [[solid geometry]] incorporating fold-up figures: ''Geometry Made Easy'' (1752), ''An Appendix to [[Euclid's Elements]]'' (1758) and ''The Theory of Perspective Demonstrated'' (1765).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mathematical Practitioners of Hanoverian England, 1714-1840|last=Taylor|first=E. G. R.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1966|page=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught geometry to subscribers of the St. Martin's Lane Academy, a drawing school established by William Hogarth and John Ellys.&lt;ref&gt;London Daily Advertiser no. 4558 (4 July 1756).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowley died in [[Walworth]], [[Surrey]]. He had a daughter called Mrs Johnstone who inherited her father's passion for science and over the years instructed many members of the British nobility in the use of globes and maps.

Between 1996 and 1999, Kedrowski summited all 55 of Colorado's Fourteeners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmc.org/Portals/0/GoverningDocs/14ers%20Master_Nov2012.pdf EVERYONE WHO HAS COMPLETED THE COLORADO FOURTEENERS] (cmc.org)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Kedrowski summitted, camped, and spent the night on top of all 55 peaks over the course of 95 days.

'''Jordan Media City''' is a media city based in [[Jordan]]. 

==History and profile==
Jordan Media City was established in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East Media on the Move|url=http://www.atkearney.com.tr/documents/10192/4095877b-119c-492b-a236-219098f229df|publisher=AT kearney|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a private company founded as a result of an agreement between the government of the [[Hashemite kingdom]] of Jordan and Dallah Production Company. It was set up with a capital of ten million [[Jordanian dinar|JD]]s (15 million US Dollars).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.jordanmediacity.com/about_us.shtm JMC - About JMC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104115158/http://www.jordanmediacity.com/about_us.shtm |date=2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It now transmits over 247 channels and retransmitts 57 radio broadcasts. Most channels are not Jordanian based, and the government still possess restrictions on Jordanian based channels which makes it hard to open new Jordanian TV channels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordanmediacity.com/en/4/Transmission&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabadvisors.com/files/reports/TOC-%20Media/ArabAdvisors-MediaTrends-DMC%20Tenants-0804-TOC.pdf Media Trends.] Arab Advisors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan Media City is centrally located next to [[Jordan Radio and Television]] Station. It is a short distance from [[Queen Alia International Airport]], and just a few minutes away from Jordan's main highway which connects the country's northern borders with its only port in [[Aqaba]] in the south.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

The '''Karakoram Highway''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|شاہراہ قراقرم}}}}, also known as '''N-35''' or '''National Highway 35''' ({{lang-ur|{{nastaliq|قومی شاہراہ 35}}}}), or the '''China-Pakistan Friendship Highway''') is a 1300&amp;nbsp;km [[National Highways of Pakistan|national highway]] which extends from [[Hasan Abdal]] in the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]] to the [[Khunjerab Pass]] in [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], where it crosses into [[China]] and becomes '''[[China National Highway 314]]'''. The highway connects the Pakistani provinces of Punjab, [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and Gilgit-Baltistan with China's [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]]. The highway is a popular [[tourist attraction]], and is one of the highest paved roads in the world, passing through the [[Karakoram]] mountain range, at {{Coord|36|51|00|N|75|25|40|E|}} at maximum elevation of {{convert|4714|m|ft}} near [[Khunjerab pass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordiaexpeditions.com/pakistan-jeep_trip.htm Karakoram Hindu Kush]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/previews/karakoram%20highway-preview.pdf Lonely Planet Karakoram] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011125340/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/previews/karakoram%20highway-preview.pdf |date=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It can be argued that the [[Chile Route 27]] is international since it connects to Argentina, and it is {{convert|4810|m|ft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its high elevation and the difficult conditions in which it was constructed, it is often referred to as the [[Eighth Wonder of the World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.inautonews.com/list-of-world-record-highways |title=World record highways – Karakoram |access-date=2 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111223514/http://www.inautonews.com/list-of-world-record-highways |archive-date=11 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahnaz Z.

== History ==
[[File:Summits of KKH.jpg|thumb|[[Rakaposhi]] Peak as seen from the Karakoram Highway near Nagar, Gilgit.]]

The Karakoram Highway, also known as the Friendship Highway in China, was built by the governments of Pakistan and China. It was started in 1959 and was completed and opened to the public in 1979. Pakistan initially favored routing through [[Mintaka Pass]]. In 1966, China citing the fact that Mintaka would be more susceptible to air strikes recommended the steeper Khunjerab Pass instead.&lt;ref name="dfdaily"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route of the KKH traces one of the many paths of the ancient [[Silk Road]].

On the Pakistani side, the road was constructed by [[Frontier Works Organisation|FWO]] (Frontier Works Organisation), employing the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers]]. The Engineer-in-Chief's Branch of the Pakistani Army completed a project documenting the history of the highway. The book ''History of Karakoram Highway'' was written by Brigadier (Retired) Muhammad Mumtaz Khalid in two volumes. In the first volume the author discusses the land and the people, the pre-historic communication system in the Northern Areas, the need for an all-weather road link with [[Gilgit]], and the construction of Indus Valley Road. The second volume records events leading to the conversion of the Indus Valley Road to the Karakoram Highway, the difficulties in its construction, and the role of Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers and their Chinese counterparts in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130613165212/http://www.historyofkkh.info/ History of KKH by Brigadier (Retired) Muhammad Mumtaz Khalid] &lt;/ref&gt;

== The Highway ==
[[File:Pakistani truck in Karakoram Highway, Passu, Northern Areas, Pakistan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jingle truck]]s on Karakoram Highway.]]
[[File:Gojal Where Pakistan Begins.jpg|thumb|The highway in [[Gojal]], Upper [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]].]]
The highway, connecting the [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] region to the ancient [[Silk Road]], runs approximately {{convert|1300|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Kashgar]], a city in the [[Xinjiang]] region of China, to [[Abbottabad]], of Pakistan. An extension of the highway southwest from [[Abbottabad]], in the form of the [[N-35 highway (Pakistan)|N-35 highway]], meets the Grand Trunk Road, [[N5 highway (Pakistan)|N-5]], at [[Hasan Abdal]], Pakistan.

The highway cuts through the [[Continental collision#Subduction zone: the collision site|collision zone]] between the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[Indian plate]]s, where China, [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Pakistan]] come within {{convert|250|km|mi}} of each other. Owing largely to the extremely sensitive state of the [[Kashmir]] conflict between India and Pakistan, the Karakoram Highway has strategic and military importance to these nations, but particularly Pakistan and China.

On 30 June 2006, a [[memorandum of understanding]] was signed between the Pakistani [[National Highway Authority]] (NHA) and China's [[State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission]] (SASAC) to rebuild and upgrade the Karakoram Highway. According to SASAC, the width will be expanded from {{convert|10|to|30|m}}, and its transport capacity will be increased three times its current capacity. In addition, the upgraded road will be designed to particularly accommodate heavy-laden vehicles and extreme weather conditions.

China and Pakistan are planning to link the Karakoram Highway to the southern port of [[Gwadar port|Gwadar]] in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] through the Chinese-aided [[Gwadar]]-[[Dalbandin]] railway, which extends to [[Rawalpindi]].

On 4 January 2010, the KKH was closed in the [[Hunza Valley]], eliminating through traffic to China except by small boats. A massive [[landslide]] {{convert|15|km|mi}} upstream from Hunza's capital of [[Karimabad (Hunza)|Karimabad]] created the potentially unstable [[Attabad Lake]], which reached {{convert|22|km|mi}} in length and over {{convert|100|m|ft}} in depth by the first week of June 2010 when it finally began flowing over the landslide dam. The landslide destroyed parts of villages while killing many inhabitants. The subsequent lake displaced thousands and inundated over {{convert|20|km|mi}} of the KKH including the {{convert|310|m|ft}} long KKH bridge {{convert|4|km|mi}} south of [[Gulmit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Lahore/10-Mar-2010/Thousands-at-risk-due-to-Hunza-river-blockade |title=Thousands at risk due to Hunza river blockade&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=7 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617040400/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Lahore/10-Mar-2010/Thousands-at-risk-due-to-Hunza-river-blockade |archive-date=17 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/sci-tech/03-rising-water-threatens-villages-in-hunza-ss-03 Search Results rising water threatens villages in hunza ss | Latest news, Breaking news, Pakistan News, World news, business, sport and multimedia | DAWN.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gilgity.blogspot.com Blockage of Hunza river, Landslide blog written by Shakeelgilgity, Gilgit-Baltistan]

It is highly questionable whether the lake, which reached {{convert|27|km|mi}} in length in 2011, will drain. Goods from and to further north are transported over the lake by small vessels, to be reloaded onto trucks at the other end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/landslide-cuts-crucial-chinapak-road-link-hits-military-supplies/627104/0 Landslide cuts crucial China-Pak road link, hits military supplies – Indian Express&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012 Pakistan began constructing a revised route around the lake at a higher elevation with five new tunnels, with total length of 7.12&amp;nbsp;km, and two new bridges.  The work was contracted out to the China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation (CRBC) and was completed in September 2015—see [[Karakorum Highway|Karakorum Highway Realignment (China-Pakistan Friendship Tunnels)]] below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Khan, Asghar  |author2=Khan, Zulfiqar Ali |title=KKH Re-Alignment: 94% work on the project completed so far, remaining to be completed by Sep. 25 this year |date=27 June 2015 |newspaper=Pamir Times |url=http://pamirtimes.net/2015/06/27/kkh-re-alignment-94-work-on-the-project-completed-so-far-remaining-to-be-completed-by-sep-25-this-year/ |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150627164303/http://pamirtimes.net/2015/06/27/kkh-re-alignment-94-work-on-the-project-completed-so-far-remaining-to-be-completed-by-sep-25-this-year/ |archivedate=27 June 2015 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pakistani section ===
[[File:Start Karkoram Highway.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Milestone near Besham in [[Pakistan]].]]

At {{convert|806|km|mi}} in length&lt;ref&gt;http://downloads.nha.gov.pk/images/stories/services/routedistance/rd4.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;, the Pakistani section of the highway starts at [[Abbottabad]], although the [[N-35 highway (Pakistan)|N-35]] of which KKH is now part, officially starts from Hasan Abdal. The highway meets the [[Indus River]] at [[Thakot]] and continues along the river until [[Jaglot]], where the [[Gilgit River]] joins the [[Indus River]]. This is where three great mountain ranges meet: the [[Hindukush]], the [[Himalaya]], and the [[Karakoram]]. The western end of the Himalayas, marked by the ninth highest peak in the world, [[Nanga Parbat]], can be seen from the highway. The highway passes through the capital of [[Gilgit–Baltistan]], [[Gilgit]], and continues through the valleys of [[Nagar Valley|Nagar]] and [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]], along the [[Hunza River]]. Some of the highest mountains and famous [[glaciers]] in the [[Karakoram]] can be seen in this section. The highway meets the Pakistani-Chinese border at [[Khunjerab Pass]].

== Karakoram Highway reconstruction ==
{{Main article|Reconstruction of the Karakoram Highway}}
[[File:KKHReconstructions.png|260px|thumb|Highlighted in red is the route of National Highway 35, which is to be completely rebuilt and upgraded under the CPEC agreement. Highlighted in blue is the 175-kilometre road between [[Gilgit]] and [[Skardu]] which is to be upgraded to a 4-lane highway.]]	

As part of the $46&amp;nbsp;billion '''[[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]]''', reconstruction and upgrade works on the Pakistani portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) are underway. The KKH spans the 806-kilometre-long distance between the China-Pakistan border and the town of [[Hasan Abdal]]. At [[Burhan Interchange]] near Hasan Abdal, the existing [[M1 motorway (Pakistan)|M1 motorway]] will intersect the Karakoram Highway. From there, access onwards to Islamabad and Lahore continues as part of the existing M1 and M2 motorways, while Hasan Abdal will also be at intersection of the [[China–Pakistan Economic Corridor#Eastern Alignment|Eastern Alignment]], and the [[Western Alignment]] which will lead towards the port city of [[Gwadar]].

=== Karakoram Highway Realignment (China-Pakistan Friendship Tunnels) ===
A large section of the highway was damaged by a landslide in 2010 that created [[Attabad Lake]]. The resulting landslides cut off both the Hunza River and Karakoram Highway resulting in the formation of the reservoir. Prior to completion of the bypass, all vehicular traffic had to be loaded onto boats to traverse the new reservoir. Construction of the tunnels began in 2012 and required 36 months for completion. The 24&amp;nbsp;km-long series of bridges and tunnels was inaugurated on 15 September 2015 at a cost of $275&amp;nbsp;million and was hailed as a major accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1206911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/956452/pm-inaugurates-tunnel-over-attabad-lake-in-g-b/&lt;/ref&gt; The route comprises 5 tunnels and several bridges. The longest tunnel is 3360&amp;nbsp;m, followed by 2736&amp;nbsp;m, 435&amp;nbsp;m, 410&amp;nbsp;m and 195&amp;nbsp;m, while the Shishkat Great Bridge on [[Hunza River]] is 480&amp;nbsp;m long. The realignment restored the road link between Pakistan and China.

=== Chinese section ===
[[File:Karakorum-carretera-d08.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The Karakoram Highway in the [[Xinjiang]] region of [[People's Republic of China|China]].]]

The Chinese section of the Karakoram Highway follows the north-south Sarykol ("Yellow Lake") valley just west of the [[Tarim Basin]]. The road from Kashgar goes southwest about {{convert|80|km|mi}} and then turns west to enter the Gez (Ghez) River canyon between [[Chakragil]] mountain on the north and [[Kongur]] mountain on the south. From the Gez canyon the population becomes Kirgiz. Having climbed up to the valley, the road turns south past Kongur, [[Karakul (China)|Karakul Lake]], and [[Muztagh Ata]] on the east. Below Muztagh Ata, a new road goes west over the [[Kulma Pass]] to join the [[Pamir Highway]] in [[Gorno-Badakhshan]], Tajikistan. The main road continues over a low pass (where the population becomes Tajik) and descends to [[Tashkurgan Town|Tashkurgan]]. Further south, a valley and jeep track leads west toward the [[Wakhjir Pass]] to the [[Wakhan Corridor]]. Next the road turns west to a checkpost and small settlement at Pirali, and then the [[Khunjerab Pass]], beyond which is Pakistan, the Khunjerab River and [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]].

== Tourism ==
In recent years the highway has sought to become a 'niche' [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]] destination although Pakistan attracts few international tourists compared to domestic ones. But in recent years, owing to the improved security situation in the country, the number of foreign tourists coming to Pakistan has more than tripled since 2013, standing at 1.75 million in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1360604|title=Foreign tourists to Pakistan more than triple since 2013|last=|first=|date=30 September 2017|website=Dawn|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the tourist destinations in the country, KKH is deemed as the "third best" by ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/oct/17/pakistan?page=all |work = The Guardian |location = London |title = Out of the rubble |first = Antonia |last = Windsor |date = 17 October 2006 |accessdate = 7 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The road has given [[mountaineers]] and cyclists easier access to the many high mountains, glaciers, and lakes in the area. The highway provides access to [[Gilgit]] and [[Skardu]] from [[Islamabad]] by road. These are the two major hubs for mountaineering expeditions in the [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;''Pakistan and the Karakoram Highway'', Owen Bennett-Jones, Lindsay Brown, and John Mock, Lonely Planet Publications; 6 Rev Ed edition (30 Sep 2004), {{ISBN|0-86442-709-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gilgit–Baltistan Administration of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Xinjiang Administration of China have signed an agreement to issue border passes to their permanent residents. This pass is valid for a calendar year and is used to travel through Khunjerab Pass only. Karakoram Highway has been described as one of the most beautiful destinations in the world. KKH provides a cross country road trip from Hasan Abdal, Pakistan to Kashghar. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Karakoram Highway |first1 = Road Trip |title = Karakoram Highway Cross Country Road Trip |url = http://www.skardu.pk/karakoram-highway-road-trip-cross-country-adventure-in-gilgit-baltistan/ |website = www.skardu.pk |publisher = Skardu.pk |accessdate = 23 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mountains and glaciers ===
[[File:Baltistan.jpg|right|thumb|220px|KKH along the [[Indus River]], 2001.]]

Karakoram Highway provides the pathway to expeditions for almost all peaks in [[Gilgit–Baltistan]], Kashmir and several peaks in [[Xinjiang]] China. The region includes some of the world's largest glaciers like the [[Baltoro Glacier|Baltoro and Siachen  Glaciers]]. Five of the [[Eight-thousander]]s (mountains taller than {{convert|8000|m|ft}}) of the world that are in [[Pakistan]] are accessible by the highway. The notable mountains that can be directly seen while travelling on the highway are:

* [[Nanga Parbat]], [[Gilgit–Baltistan]], 9th highest of the world at {{convert|8126|m|ft}}
* [[Rakaposhi]], [[Gilgit–Baltistan]], 27th highest of the world at {{convert|7788|m|ft}}
* [[Diran]], [[Gilgit–Baltistan]], most dangerous mountain in [[Pakistan]]
* Shishpar, [[Gilgit–Baltistan]], 
* [[Ultar Peak]], [[Gilgit–Baltistan]], 
* Tupopdan, [[Gilgit–Baltistan]], also known as Cathedral Peaks near [[Passu]]

Many glaciers can be seen while travelling on the highway:

* Minapin Glacier
* Passu Glacier
* Ghulkin Glacier
* Khunjerab Glacier

=== Rivers and lakes ===
[[File:Karakoram Highway .jpg|thumb|230px|Karakoram Highway near [[Juglot|Juglo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t, where three mightiest mountain ranges meet]]

Several rivers and lakes are made accessible by the highway. These include:
* [[Indus River]]
* [[Hunza River]]
* [[Attabad Lake]]
* [[Gilgit River]]
* [[Khunjerab River]]
* [[Karakul (China)|Karakul Lake]] in Xinjiang (China)

=== Rock art and petroglyphs ===
{{Main article|Northern Areas, Pakistan#Rock art and petroglyphs}}

[[File:Shattial Carvings.JPG|thumb|On the Karokoram Highway near Chilas.]]

There are more than 50,000 pieces of rock art and [[petroglyph]]s all along the highway that are concentrated at ten major sites between [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] and [[Shatial]]. The carvings were left by invaders, traders, and [[pilgrims]] who passed along the trade route, as well as by locals. The earliest date back to between 5000 and 1000 BC, showing single animals, triangular men, and hunting scenes in which the animals are larger than the hunters. These [[Stone carving|carvings]] were pecked into the rock with stone tools and are covered with a thick [[patina]] that yields their age.

=== Travel ===
There are several transport companies in Pakistan that offer bus service between major towns of the highway and from [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Lahore]]. The largest company is [[Northern Areas Transport Corporation]] (NATCO). Other companies are Masherbrum Travel, Silk Route Travel, K-2 movers, Anchan Travel, and Saeed Travel.

=== Bus service between Gilgit and Kashghar ===
On 1 June 2006, a daily bus service began between [[Gilgit]], [[Gilgit–Baltistan]], and [[Kashghar]], Xinjiang, through the [[Sust]] and [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County|Tashkorgan]] border area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.dawn.com/2006/03/23/nat2.htm |title=Kashghar-Gilgit bus service planned |newspaper=[[DAWN (newspaper)|DAWN Newspaper]] |date = 23 March 2006 |dead-url = yes |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090215045454/http://www.dawn.com/2006/03/23/nat2.htm |archive-date = 15 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weather ==
The KKH is best travelled in the spring or early autumn. Heavy snow during harsh winters can shut the highway down for extended periods. Heavy [[monsoon]] rains around July and August cause occasional [[landslides]] that can block the road for hours or more. The border crossing between China and [[Pakistan]] at [[Khunjerab Pass]] is open only between 1 May and 31 December.

A '''''katepanikion''''' ({{lang-el|κατεπανίκιον}}) was a [[Byzantine]] term for an area under the control of a ''[[katepano]]''. It was used to describe two different types of administrative divisions:

* From ca. 971 until the late 11th century, it referred to large circumscriptions comprising several [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]s and commanded by a ''[[dux|doux]]'' ("duke") or ''[[katepano]]'' ("catepan"). In English, the divisions are usually termed "duchy" (in Greek ''doukaton'') or "catepanate" (''katepanikion'').
* In the [[Palaiologan period]], the ''katepanikion'' became a much smaller province comprising a fortified town and its surroundings or an island, under a ''[[kephale (Byzantine Empire)|kephale]]'' and also termed a ''kephalatikion''.

The '''larger urban zone''' ('''LUZ'''), or '''Functional Urban Area''' ('''FUA'''), is a measure of the population and expanse of [[metropolitan area]]s in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurometrex.org/Docs/METRO-D/7B-Position-on-Cohesion.pdf Position Statement on Cohesion Policy 2014–2020], EuroMETREX. Retrieved 2 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a city and its commuting zone.&lt;ref name="fua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/European_cities_%E2%80%93_the_EU-OECD_functional_urban_area_definition | title=European cities – the EU-OECD functional urban area definition  | accessdate=2 August 2015 | publisher=[[Eurostat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition was introduced in 2004 by [[Eurostat]], the statistical agency of the [[European Union]] (EU), in agreement with the national statistics offices in the member states.&lt;ref name="urbanaudit"&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Eurostat|year = 2006|url = http://www.urbanaudit.org|title = City statistics - Urban audit|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090206144738/http://urbanaudit.org/|archivedate = 6 February 2009|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wrongc"&gt;{{cite news|publisher = Dr. Berthold Feldmann, Eurostat|date = March 2006|url = http://www.urbanaudit.org/MarchMeetingResources/UA%20day_Eurostat%20focus.ppt#1|title = The shift of Eurostat to Urban Statistics|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060920020445/http://www.urbanaudit.org/MarchMeetingResources/UA%20day_Eurostat%20focus.ppt#1|archivedate = 20 September 2006|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurostat data is provided on cities in the EU, its [[Future enlargement of the European Union|candidate countries]] and [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] countries. Several cities were excluded by definition from the 2004 list of LUZs on technical, definitional grounds, such as the coincidence of the metropolitan area with the urban zone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statistiques-locales.insee.fr/Fiches/RS/AU1999/RS_AU1999003.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727094822/http://www.statistiques-locales.insee.fr/Fiches/RS/AU1999/RS_AU1999003.pdf |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistiques-locales.insee.fr/Fiches/RS/AU1999/RS_AU1999004.pdf |accessdate=19 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727094843/http://www.statistiques-locales.insee.fr/Fiches/RS/AU1999/RS_AU1999004.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistiques-locales.insee.fr/Fiches/RS/AU1999/RS_AU1999006.pdf |accessdate=19 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727094905/http://www.statistiques-locales.insee.fr/Fiches/RS/AU1999/RS_AU1999006.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LUZ represents an attempt at a harmonised definition of the [[metropolitan area]]. Eurostat's objective was to have an area from which a significant share of the residents commute into the city, a concept known as the "functional urban region." To ensure a good data availability, Eurostat adjusts the LUZ boundaries to administrative boundaries that approximate the functional urban region.

In 2006 LUZ definitions were changed significantly, improving the comparability of LUZ definitions across different countries, and allowing for almost all cities to be included.

==List of larger urban zones==

This is a list of larger urban zones. The Urban Audit also includes cities from [[EFTA]] countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) and EU candidate countries. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) uses a similar definition of Functional Urban Area to represent population sizes of cities in OECD countries.&lt;ref name="OEDC Populations in cities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?Datasetcode=CITIES# |title=OEDC Populations in cities| publisher=OEDC| accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data is also included.

The figures in the Eurostat database are an attempt at a compromise between harmonised data for all of the European Union, and with availability of statistical data, making comparisons more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanaudit.org/CityCountryPDFLongList.aspx |title=Urban Audit Database |publisher=Urbanaudit.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523080414/http://www.urbanaudit.org/CityCountryPDFLongList.aspx |archivedate=23 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of larger urban zones by population as of 2004===

This is a list of larger urban zones by population as of 2004. The 2004 Urban Audit also includes cities from [[EFTA]] countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) and EU candidate countries, although the only candidate country for which there is available data is Turkey. Some cities, including Marseille, Lille, Nice, Cordoba, Badajoz, Toulon and Montpellier were excluded from the 2004 list on technical, definitional grounds, such as the coincidence of the metropolitan area with the urban zone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">[[File:Surface with path of greatest slope.png|thumb|431px|A surface showing one example (approximate) of a path of greatest slope (red path).]]
In [[topography]], the '''line of greatest slope''' is a curve following the steepest [[slope]]. In [[Downhill mountain biking|mountain biking]] and [[alpine skiing|skiing]], the line of greatest slope is sometimes called the [[Fall line (topography)|fall line]].&lt;ref name="rr"&gt;[https://rootsrated.com/brevard-nc/mountain-biking/farlow-gap https://rootsrated.com] Farlow Gap – Mountain Biking: fall line (2nd paragraph) — "The trail becomes loose and rocky, and becomes fall line into a wide open rock garden..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Mathematically, the line (or path) of greatest slope from a point is determined by the [[gradient]] of height, taken as a [[potential|potential field]] with respect to an acceleration from the force of gravity. Lines of greatest slope are analogous to [[line of force|lines of force]] acting to accelerate an object downward at that point.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} These lines are [[orthogonal]] to [[contour line]]s. Discounting [[inertial force]]s and terrain roughness, a ball rolling down a slope, or water flowing down, will accelerate in the direction of greatest slope.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Applications==
===Mountain biking===
[[File:Emmeline-Ragot.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A [[Mountain biking|mountain biker]] riding a trail which follows the line of greatest slope, or [[Fall line (topography)|fall line]].]]
In [[mountain biking]] the line of greatest slope defines the [[Fall line (topography)|fall line]], which is the path a trail will follow to descend a hill or mountain with the shortest path,&lt;ref name="rr"/&gt; and will also cause the rider to gain the most velocity (assuming brakes are not used, and other factors such as rolling resistance are equal).

===Mountain climbing===
[[File:Contour map with an example fall line.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The line of greatest slope defines the path (red) a climber will take to gain the most elevation with the shortest possible path.]]
In [[Mountaineering|mountain climbing]], the line of greatest slope defines the fall line, which is the path a climber will take to gain the most elevation with the shortest possible path.

===Map reading===
The line of greatest slope has practical significance in map reading. On the terrain it is often far more discernible, even intuitively obvious, rather than accurately picking out the consistent height level on what is likely the undulating uneven ground along the ground represented on the contour line.  But knowing that a greatest slope vector is orthogonal to the contour line, one can readily deduce the direction of the contour lines from the line of greatest slope.  The extent and overall direction of the contour line to a map scale can only be found on the topographic map.
 
By noting the corresponding compass vector, walking along the contour one can line up a hand held compass aligning the expected direction, and eye-balling the line of contour's estimated level, move up or down along the bearing faster&amp;mdash; to closely locate a desired point (planned point) along the hillside.{{Clarify|date=June 2017}} Pragmatically, this can be 'good enough' for rough project landscaping, such as timber clear cutting the work site of a structure like a [[bridge]] [[abutment]] or connecting ramps. The approximation can then be refined by transit and other surveyor tools to construct on target.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''My Hero'' episodes}}
The following is a list of episodes of the [[BBC]] comedy series '''''[[My Hero (UK TV series)|My Hero]]''''', starring [[Ardal O'Hanlon]] as Ultronian superhero George Sunday and [[Emily Joyce]] as his human wife, Janet. Six series were broadcast between 2000 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/m/myhero_66602550.shtml ''My Hero''] at the BBC Comedy Guide.&lt;/ref&gt; Each series featured a varying number of episodes, with the first and second series containing six episodes, series three through five containing ten episodes each and series six containing eight episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080905080726/http://www.bigbearfilms.co.uk/myhero.htm ''My Hero''] at Big Bear Films home page&lt;/ref&gt;

The first series was the only series to include a Christmas Special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/my-hero/show/3671/summary.html?tag=login;dropdown|title=My Hero|website=TV.com|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the series gathered consistent viewing figures, figures for the sixth series declined heavily following the appointment of [[James Dreyfus]] to replace outgoing lead actor O'Hanlon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/hero/index.html|title=My Hero (Summary)|website=Phill.co.uk|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was subsequently axed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/my_hero/|title=My Hero - BBC1 Sitcom - British Comedy Guide|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the six series have been released on DVD; two on [[Region 1 DVD]] and one on Region 2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080720031824/http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/comedy_games/my_hero/my_hero.jsp ''My Hero''] at BBC America.&lt;/ref&gt; Fans have since petitioned the [[BBC]] to release the complete series on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080608151858/http://www.downthetubes.net/tv/my_hero/ ''My Hero''] News, episode guide and interviews at downthetubes.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Suddenly George is an intellectual genius, and can charm the birds off the trees—so much so that not only do Ella and Stanley invite him to their party, they ask him to make a speech.

===Series 6 (2006)===
Series six was the first and only series to feature [[James Dreyfus]] in the lead role, taking over from the outgoing [[Ardal O'Hanlon]]. Due to declining ratings, and the poor public reception to Dreyfus, the series was axed, leading to the final two episodes being broadcast on Sunday lunchtimes, rather than the prime-time slot on Friday evenings.

==H==

The DST column shows the months in which Daylight Saving Time, a.k.a. Summer Time, begins and ends. A blank DST box usually indicates that the location stays on Standard Time all year, although in some cases the location stays on Summer Time all year. If a location is currently on DST, add one hour to the time in the Time column.

[[File:Rail density map.svg|thumb|right|350px|Rail network divided by area of country]]

This '''list of countries by rail transport network size''' based on [[International Union of Railways]] data ranks countries by length of rail lines worked at end of year updated with other reliable sources. These figures also include urban/suburban mass-transport systems; as well as lines which are not used for passenger services.&lt;ref name="lewandIJEIT" &gt;{{Cite journal | first = Krzysztof | last =  Lewandowski | title = New coefficients of rail transport usage|journal=International Journal of Engineering and Innovative Technology (IJEIT)|volume=5|issue=6| year=2015| pages=89–91|ISSN=2277-3754|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294534165_New_coefficients_of_rail_transport_usage| format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''extreme points of India''' include the coordinates that are further north, south, east or west than any other location in [[India]]; and the highest and the lowest altitudes in the country. The northernmost point claimed by India is in territory disputed between India and [[Pakistan]]. With the exception of [[Kanyakumari]] ([[Cape Comorin]]), the southern-most location of mainland India, all other extreme locations are uninhabited. But some consider Indira point as the extreme tip but the consideration is neither right nor wrong.

The latitude and longitude are expressed in [[Geographic coordinate system#Degrees: a measurement of angle|decimal degree notation]], in which a positive latitude value refers to the northern hemisphere, and a negative value refers to the southern hemisphere. Similarly, a positive longitude value refers to the eastern hemisphere, and a negative value refers to the western hemisphere. The coordinates used in this article are sourced from [[Google Earth]], which makes use of the [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]] geodetic reference system. Additionally, a negative altitude value refers to land below sea level.

==Extreme points==
The northernmost point that India claims lies in the territory now administered by China as part of [[Xinjiang]] but once claimed by [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and therefore claimed by India as part of the disputed state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].  The northernmost point administered by India lies in Jammu &amp; Kashmir. India's claim to the whole of Kashmir is disputed by Pakistan and China, with the territory currently partitioned into [[Pakistan]]'s state of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], the Chinese region of [[Aksai Chin]] and the Indian-administered state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/353352.stm|title=Q&amp;A: Kashmir dispute|date=2002-11-25|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-09-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521125110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/353352.stm|archivedate=2008-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list provides the northernmost point as claimed by India; the northern-most disputed point that is administered by India; and the northern-most undisputed point in India. This case also applies to the highest elevated regions.

India's eastern-most state is [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. Part of the state is [[South Tibet dispute|claimed by China]] as "South Tibet", though administered by India, The easternmost of Indian-administered territory is located in this disputed region.&lt;ref name="rediff"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/nov/16sld1.htm|title=Why China claims Arunachal Pradesh|date=2006-11-16|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2008-09-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617232324/http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/nov/16sld1.htm|archivedate=2008-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, this list mentions both the disputed and undisputed eastern-most points in India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23009">This is a list of '''German language names for places located in [[Slovenia]]'''. Those names have important historical value.

==Historical perspective==

Until 1866, the only official language used in the Empire of Austria administration was the
German. Some German place names were only "Germanised" versions of the original Slavic
names.

The [[compromise of 1867]] marked the start of a recognition of the need to bilingualism in
areas where an important proportion of another language was used.

In the provinces that now are (completely or not) part of Slovenia, the languages used
were (near 1900):&lt;ref&gt;Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den österreichischen
Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]: German (72%), Slovenian (28%)
* [[Carniola]]: Slovenian (94%), German (6%)
* [[Austrian Littoral]]: Italian (45%), Slovenian (31%), Serbo-Croat (21%), German (2%)
* [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]]: German (68%), Slovenian (32%).

It may thus be more appropriate to state that German names were all ''official'' endonyms.

As illustrated by the name of post-offices, many towns and villages received a dual name
after 1867 (the fact became a law in 1871&lt;ref&gt;Klein p.28, Erlass vom 2. April 1871.&lt;/ref&gt;), except - as stated - where there was a clear
German speaking majority.

The code (used in the list) of the Austrian Districts ''Bezirkshauptmannschaften'' in 1900&lt;ref&gt;Klein 1967, Die politische Gliederung der Österreishischen Reischshälfte, p.11-14.&lt;/ref&gt; is given hereafter, for verification and further use:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12263">This is a list of the largest river basins without fragmentation by [[dam]]s in their catchments, ordered by average annual discharge.

To qualify for inclusion, a river must not only have no dams on its “main” stem, but also no dams on any tributary. For this reason, major world rivers such as the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], [[Lena River|Lena]], [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]], [[Amur River|Amur]], and [[Fraser River|Fraser]] are disqualified because of dams on tributary streams.

Many of the rivers in this list have uncertain discharges. With the exception of those in Russia, streamgauges have seldom (if ever) been placed on the majority of the largest unfragmented river systems, due to the remoteness and/or ruggedness of the terrain in which they are located. Apart from the Fly which is clearly the largest, all ranks listed here are not perfectly certain, and there also exist a number of rivers in [[Sundaland]] that might qualify with reliable discharge data, such as the [[Kapuas River|Kapuas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.wri.org/watersheds_2003/as14.pdf|title=Watersheds of Asia and Oceania: AS 13 Kapuas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MineCam1.jpg|thumb|MineCam Mk 4]]

The '''MineCam''' is a remote exploration camera built by [[I.A.Recordings]]. It is used for [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] exploration and other similar environments. It was originally conceptualized in 1988, and since went under several design revisions. The name MineCam, is a pun on [[MiniCam]], an early hand-held broadcast camera built by [[CBS Laboratories]].

==History==

Peter Eggleston of [[I.A.Recordings]] first had the idea for what became "MineCam" in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, Mike (ed.): "Cave Radio &amp; Electronics Group Journal Number 22", pages 3 - 6. British Cave Research Association 1995. ISSN 1361-4800&lt;/ref&gt; He had been visiting some metal mines in [[Wales]] with the [[Shropshire]] Caving and Mining Club and spent several hours setting up a [[single rope technique]] rig to descend a remote shaft, only to find that there were no ways off at the bottom. This was the motivation to build a miniature camera which would allow enthusiasts to explore hard to reach, unsafe, or impossible to reach areas.

The remote exploration of mines prior to 1988 had been done commercially for several years by [[pipeline video inspection|pipeline camera firms]] using equipment that needed to be housed in a vehicle and powered by a generator. Many old mine shafts are remote from roads though, so Peter's final goal was a small lightweight battery-powered kit which could be carried on foot. The first two versions of MineCam did not achieve this, but tested various approaches with the video technology available at the time.

==Versions==
===MineCam 1===

MineCam 1 used a monochrome [[vidicon]] camera in a waterproof housing made out of a 10&amp;nbsp;cm plastic sewer pipe and fittings, with an acrylic window. This was successfully tested in the deep end of a swimming pool. The camera was insensitive - it needed a 150&amp;nbsp;W lamp, which required a 240&amp;nbsp;V supply, but so did the camera. The cable was 100&amp;nbsp;m of  video [[Co-axial cable|co-axial]] and  power, taped together at 2&amp;nbsp;m intervals and numbered to give a crude depth measurement. The camera and lamp were heavy, so an old 6&amp;nbsp;mm static climbing rope was used to support it. The monitor was a 10&amp;nbsp;cm portable TV.

MineCam 1 worked, but the monochrome image was sometimes difficult to interpret. It was time to try colour, and this was not yet available from the commercial shaft inspection firms.

===MineCam 2===

MineCam 2 used parts from a disused Sony '[[Handycam]].' The colour [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] chip was removed and put in a round tobacco tin connected by a short cable to the rest of the electronics in a small Eddystone die-cast box. The 'Eddy box' contained extra hardware to convert the Y/C (700&amp;nbsp;kHz) direct [[Heterodyne|colour-under]] output to composite [[PAL]], and provide various unusual power supply voltages. Because of the colour stripe filter and the early technology, this CCD was only as sensitive as the monochrome vidicon.

Both MineCam 1 and 2 needed to be lowered twice to investigate a shaft. First, they were lowered looking vertically down, and notes made of the depth and heading of any interesting features. The camera was then hauled to the surface and re-rigged to look horizontally at the interesting items found earlier. A remote tilt mechanism was needed as it would halve the time and effort.

To indicate heading, MineCams 1 and 2 used an ordinary spherical fluid-mounted car compass on an aluminium arm about 30&amp;nbsp;cm from the camera. A supplementary lens (from an old pair of spectacles) glued to the acrylic window brought the compass into focus at the corner of the frame.

===MineCam 3===

Mark 3 was radically different. A high quality colour camera became available, a Pulnix TMC-X&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rapitron.it/archivi/OldindustrcolE.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605015842/http://www.rapitron.it/archivi/OldindustrcolE.htm |archivedate=2008-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; not much bigger than a Mini-[[Maglite]]. It was also much more sensitive, so the light could be smaller and a remote tilt mechanism became practicable. A coded control signal was needed that would go down the video cable to save using extra wires, so a model radio control system was adapted, giving 2 proportional channels for tilt and eventual pan movements. The 27&amp;nbsp;MHz carrier was easily combined and split from the baseband video. The first tilt motor was a standard model control servo with 180 degree rotation. The camera head and light were mounted in an open-framework cage about 25&amp;nbsp;cm long, rotated on a horizontal axis by the servo. Despite taking care, motor gears were frequently stripped when the cage hit obstacles and the servo had to be replaced regularly! The light source needed to pan with the camera, so had to be small enough to fit in the cage. A 12&amp;nbsp;V 50&amp;nbsp;W quartz-halogen lamp with 5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter integral [[dichroic]] reflector was fitted, powered from a small switch-mode PSU. Although the lighting power had been reduced, it still required a high voltage supply down the cable to reduce voltage drop, so 240&amp;nbsp;V was still used.

The cage rotated in an aluminium yoke attached to the bottom of a waterproof plastic box containing the rest of the electronics, including a power supply for the camera.

To be able to use the system in locations remote from mains power and not accessible by a vehicle carrying a generator, I.A.Recordings obtained a 150&amp;nbsp;W [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]] and 12V lead-acid battery from an outdoor leisure shop.

MineCam 3 was the first to use an electronic compass for heading display. Tandy ([[Radio Shack Corporation|Radio Shack]]) had developed a device using a [[flux gate]] sensor to give x &amp; y components of the Earth's magnetic field which drove the orthogonal windings of a 360 degree mechanical indicator, for use as a car compass. I.A.Recordings discarded the indicator and used the x &amp; y voltages to control the position of a flashing spot added to the video picture. This gave a compass-circle type display on screen. If the x (east-west) signal was inverted, when looking vertically down, the spot appeared to be fixed above a point on the ground as the camera rotated.

Electromagnetic interference from the [[switch mode power supply]] and harmonics of its square-wave power waveform appeared in the video signal as noise. This was reduced by careful layout, screening and the use of a single-point ground return.

The miniature camera was waterproofed by sliding it into a square-section 25&amp;nbsp;mm wide aluminium tube (only slightly bigger than the camera), with a glass window glued in one end, and a cable gland at the other. The waterproof container sold for this camera was too large and heavy for the MineCam, but the aluminium tube is not as watertight. It has an [[IP rating]] of between 66 and 67.

===MineCam 4===

For MineCam 4, the final major development was a pan motor. It was difficult to arrange a system which allowed 360 degree rotation of the tilt yoke whilst maintaining connections for video, tilt servo, lighting power, camera power and flux-gate sensor. An [[RS Components]] geared dc servo motor was used, driven from the remote control receiver, and a thrust bearing and [[Oldham coupler]]. The motor's powerful magnet interfered with the compass sensor so a sheet of [[mu-metal]] donated by a helpful local firm was formed into a screen round the whole motor &amp; gearbox assembly. The tilt servo did not seem to cause the same problem, as it is smaller and rotates with the sensor on the yoke. Wherever possible, all hardware is plastic or non-ferrous metal.

Other improvements in MineCam 4 include a high-torque tilt servo, a microphone with balanced amplifier, a laser diode module beside the camera to produce a spot of light on the subject for range and size estimation and experimentation with bat detection and gas sensors.

The control box is {{nowrap|18 cm × 13 cm × 6 cm}} and contains a power supply, the servo control transmitter and a video [[Equalization (communications)|equaliser]]. The cable is now 200&amp;nbsp;m of thin multi-core containing one coaxial and 5 single wires. As it is not load-bearing, a rope still has to be used and 9&amp;nbsp;mm static climbing rope was found to be better than anything thinner, including wire rope, at preventing twist. The rope often becomes tangled with the cable, so I.A.Recordings is still looking for a weight-bearing cable. The 180 degree tilt range allows the underside of shaft caps to be inspected. Compared with commercial versions which were still monochrome and used a mirror to switch the image from vertical to horizontal, the MineCam was much more flexible, and the goal of having a complete system that could be carried by individuals on foot had been reached. The picture was recorded on [[U-Matic]], then [[Hi-8]] and now on [[mini-DV]] tape.

==Rigging==

To get the camera out over the centre of larger shafts, I.A.Recordings use either a scaffold pole with a pulley on the end, or for shafts that have run-in so the crater on the surface is several metres wide, they have developed a "[[Tyrolean traverse]]" or "[[Blondin (quarry equipment)|Blondin]]" arrangement. A large diameter pulley (a [[Sinclair C5]] wheel) is mounted on a trolley which is winched along a wire rope slung across the shaft and kept in tension. When the pulley is centred, the traverse rope is locked-off and the camera lowering rope can be released.

The 50&amp;nbsp;W lamp &amp; reflector is a convenient size and is available in a variety of beam-widths, but the idea of the dichroic reflector preventing heat being reflected forward is actually a disadvantage for the MineCam. The lamp head has to be enclosed to protect it and to screen the power supply interference, but without careful internal design of reflectors and baffles, the housing can get very hot.

MineCam 4 has proved reliable and useful and gives a high-quality colour picture good enough to use in video productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.iarecordings.org/productions/p12.html|title= Snailbeach- Industrial Archaeology, Mining History}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is featured for example in the I.A.Recordings video "Snailbeach".

The '''Mokroluški Creek''' ({{lang-sr|Мокролушки поток}} / ''Mokroluški potok'', "Mokri Lug Creek") is a stream in north-central [[Serbia]], which forms a {{convert|15|km|miles|adj=mid|-long|0}} former right tributary to the [[Sava]] river. During its entire course, it runs through the urban section of [[Belgrade]]. It is one of the 40 rivers, streams and creeks that flow or used to flow through Belgrade, but the majority of them are conducted underground into the city sewage system which is also the case with Mokroluški potok.

The Mokroluški potok originates in Belgrade's eastern neighborhood of [[Veliki Mokri Lug]], in the municipality of [[Zvezdara]], which also gives the name to the stream (''Mokri Lug stream''). The Mokroluški potok flows generally in a north-west direction and its valley is used as a route for the Belgrade-[[Niš]] highway (constructed 1967-74). After it passes the cemetery of the neighboring [[Mali Mokri Lug]], it reaches the neighborhood of [[Medaković III]] where the stream is conducted underground for the first time. The channeled mouth of the stream is still visible under the [[Gazela Bridge]].

After an underground flow of about one kilometer, the stream resurfaces in the neighborhood of [[Medaković II]], but one kilometer later, in the neighborhood of [[Marinkova Bara]], it goes underground again. Formerly, it used to flow through the neighborhoods of [[Dušanovac]], [[Autokomanda]] and [[Jatagan Mala]]. The area in the lower valley of the now underground stream was used for digging earth and gravel which were used to cover and drain the swamps on the Sava's right bank, so that neighborhoods of [[Savamala]] and [[Bara Venecija]] could be constructed, and for the building of Belgrade's central railway station. After the works were completed, the area around Mokroluški potok was left as a steep, elongated cut in the ground and so was given its present name ([[Prokop (Belgrade)|Prokop]]).

Before it was channeled, the stream often flooded the area of Dušanovac and Marinkova Bara during the heavy rains,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Zdravko Zdravković | title = Još nešto o Starom savskom mostu | trans-title = More info on the Old Sava Bridge | newspaper = Politika | page = 26 | language = Serbian | date = 12 December 2017 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/394307/Jos-nesto-o-Starom-savskom-mostu }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was where it received two tributaries, Duboki potok from the north and Kumodraški potok, from the south.

== Importance ==

The valley of the creek was a route for the [[Roman aqueduct]], which conducted the waters from the Mokri Lug area to the [[Belgrade Fortress|Singidunum castrum]]. At some point, it received waters from another aqueduct, from the left, which originated in the modern neighborhood of [[Kumodraž]]. Both Mokri Lug and Kumodraž are located on the hills, so the natural inclination allowed for the water to flow downhill to Singidunum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Branka Jakšić | title = Pogled s neba i podzemne avanture | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 24 September 2017 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/389373/Pogled-s-neba-i-podzemne-avanture }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though undistinguished in terms of hydrology, the stream was important in Belgrade geography, while in architecture it has been described as the "key topology character of Belgrade's history". Its valley serves as the route for the highway. A small bridge (''most'') over the stream, near its mouth into the Sava, gave name to the local kafana "Mostar" after which, in turn, the entire neighborhood was named [[Mostar interchange|Mostar]]. In architecture, "the narrative of the Belgrade's terrain ended steeply at the (stream's) line, finalizing the development of [[Savamala|Sava amphitheater]] and marking the edge of the city in its next spreading to the south, further from the [[Belgrade Fortress]] and the Trench (which surrounded it)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Bojan Kovačević | title = Lica grada | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = | language = Serbian | date = April 2014 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Afadja''' is one of the highest mountains in [[Ghana]] standing at an elevation of {{convert|885|m|ft|0}}.  The mountain is located in the [[Agumatsa Range]] near the villages of Gbledi and Liati Wote, in the [[Volta Region]] of Ghana at the border with [[Togo]].  
'Afadja' is the name of the mountain whereas 'to' in the Ewe dialect means mountain therefore, it is called 'Afadjato' by the indigenes. The correct name would be 'Mount Afadja' as 'Mount Afadjato' will be a repetition of the 'Mountain.' Mount Afadja is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the Volta Region of Ghana welcoming thousands of visitors from around the globe annually.

About a kilometer ( less than a mile) to the east, is the nearby peak of [[Aduadu]], which is higher than Afadjato, also standing at over 900 metres.  

When the indigenes migrated to the area and saw the mountain it looked like the mound in which water yam is planted, water yam being called "Avadze" in Ewe. Moreover there were some creeping plants on the mountain that resembled the water yam plant; they therefore called it "Avadze-to". Today the word has been palatalized into "Afadjato". 

The nearby [[Tagbo Falls]] and [[Wli waterfalls|Wli Falls]] (the highest in West Africa) are also considered tourist attractions. There are several hidden attractions of caves, streams and other waterfalls in the area.

'''Nagykörű''' is a village in [[Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok]] county, in the [[Northern Great Plain]] region of central [[Hungary]].

== Location ==
The village is located on the right bank of River Tisza, 25 kilometres away to the northeast from [[Szolnok]]. It can be approached on road by scheduled overland bus from the west, by ferry from the direction of [[Fegyvernek]] (from the east), or by bicycle on Tisza-dam.

== History ==

Nagykörű got its name because it was almost completely compassed by [[Tisza]] before the river control. The settlement was rising as an isle among the neighboring river meadows. The first written document of Nagykörű monastery derives from year 1212. The village itself was founded at the beginning of the 14th century, and it belonged to the property of Ban Lothar of Gutkeled.

The estate called Kürümonostora was endowed by King [[Charles Robert]] in 1318 to Peter Kompolty, chamberlain of the queen. Owing to its geographic position, Nagykörű managed to survive the [[Turkey|Turkish]] rule successfully. According to the legend, the Turkish troops were lost in the [[marsh]] on 19 July 1530 (day of Elijah). After expelling Turks, the [[Treasury]] and an [[Austria]]n officer called Enczinger became holders of the village.
[[File:Trešnje germersdorfske.jpg|thumb|180px|Germersdorf cherries]]

In the middle of 18th century, Nagykörű started to develop spectacularly. The first [[vineyard]] was planted on Homok (sandy soil) by Baron Lőrinc Orczy in 1751. Thanks to landlord György Petrovay, this place became the cultivation area of the famous Germersdorf [[cherry]] in the second half of 19th century. Nagykörű owns title "Cherry garden of Hungary" as the biggest (200 [[hectares]]) cherry garden of the country can be found here. Cherry of Nagykörű is a trade-mark.

== Ethnic groups ==

In 2001, according to the census, 94 percent of the population avowed themselves [[Hungary|Hungarian]], while 6 percent of the population avowed themselves [[Roma (ethnonym)|Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepszamlalas.hu/hun/kotetek/06/16/data/tabhun/4/prnt01_11_0.html] Ethnic database of census in 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== The present ==

Worldwide famous cherry of Nagykörű is considered to be the cost-of-living source of inhabitants. Cherry is principally grown for [[export]]. Meanwhile, villageous [[tourism]] is also prospering. The ratio of resident population is decreasing, whereas fourth of the houses are used as holiday resorts. The surrounding neighborhood is a real paradise for tourists, line-fishermen, and bathers.

[[File:Prowincje I RP.svg|thumb|300px|right|Provinces of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]
A '''''prowincja''''' ({{IPA-pl|prɔˈvint͡sja}}; plural: ''prowincje'') was the largest territorial  subdivision in [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]]-era Poland, and later in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The term designated each of the two largest constituents of the state: depending on the period, including ''[[Wielkopolska]]'' (Greater Poland), ''[[Małopolska]]'' (Lesser Poland) and (upon the formation of the Commonwealth) the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. [[Ducal Prussia]] was often counted as part of the Greater Poland; [[Livonia|Inflanty]] (Livonia) as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the [[Ruthenia]]n territories were split between Lesser Poland and the Grand Duchy.

Though larger than a [[voivodeship]] (''województwo''), the ''prowincja'' was less important in terms of offices and power. In most respects, it was merely a titular unit of administration. The real power lay with the voivodeship—and, to a lesser extent, with ''[[ziemia]]''s (lands).

Occasionally the term voivodeship will be misleadingly translated into English as a province, leading to potential confusion.

The Polish term "''prowincja''" has not been used to denote any part of independent Poland since the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795)—unlike "''ziemia''", which has continued to be used for certain geographical areas.  Since 1795, the Polish word "''prowincja''" has been used only for certain foreign-imposed units of administration within territories of the old [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

The '''Qattara Depression''' ({{lang-ar|منخفض القطارة}} ''Munḫafaḍ al-Qaṭṭārah'') is a [[depression (geology)|depression]] in northwestern [[Egypt]], specifically in the [[Matruh Governorate]]. The depression is part of the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert of Egypt]]. 
The Qattara Depression lies below sea level, and its bottom is covered with [[salt pan (geology)|salt pans]], [[sand dunes]], and [[salt marsh]]es. The depression extends between the latitudes of 28°35' and 30°25' north and the longitudes of 26°20' and 29°02' east.&lt;ref name="El Bassyony"&gt;El Bassyony, Abdou. 1995. ''"Introduction to the geology of the Qattara Depression,"'' International Conference on the Studies and Achievements of Geosciences in Egypt, 69 (85-eoa)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Qattara Depression was created by the interplay of salt weathering and wind erosion. Some 20 kilometres west of the depression lie the oases of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa in Egypt]] and [[Jaghbub, Libya|Jaghbub in Libya]] in smaller but similar depressions.

The Qattara Depression contains the second lowest point in Africa at an altitude of {{convert|133|m|ft}} below sea level, the lowest point being [[Lake Assal (Djibouti)|Lake Assal]] in Djibouti. The depression covers about {{convert|19605|km2|sqmi}}, a size comparable with [[Lake Ontario]] or twice as large as [[Lebanon]]. Due to its size and proximity to the shores of the  [[Mediterranean Sea]], studies have been made for the potential to generate [[hydroelectricity]] here.

==Geography==
[[File:The Qattara Depression, Egypt, Matruh Governate.png|thumb|400px|Map of the Qattara Depression.&lt;br/&gt; Lower left bound: 28°36'30.74"N 26°14'31.08"E.&lt;br/&gt; Upper right bound: 30°31'1.74"N 29° 8'51.83"E.]]

The  Qattara Depression has the shape of a teardrop, with its point facing east and the broad deep area facing southwest. The northern side of the depression is characterised by steep escarpments up to 280 meters high, marking the edge of the adjacent El Diffa plateau. To the south the depression slopes gently up to the [[Egyptian Sand Sea|Great Sand Sea]].

Within the Depression are [[salt marsh]]es, under the northwestern and northern [[escarpment]] edges, and extensive [[dry lake]] beds that flood occasionally. The marshes occupy approximately {{convert|300|km2|sqmi}}, although wind-blown sands are encroaching in some areas. About a quarter of the region is occupied by dry lakes composed of hard crust and sticky mud, and occasionally filled with water.

The depression was initiated by either wind or fluvial erosion in the late [[Neogene]], but during the [[Quaternary Period]] the dominant mechanism was a combination of [[Weathering#Salt-crystal growth|salt weathering]] and [[Erosion#Wind|wind erosion]] working together. First, the salts break up the depression floor, then the wind blows away the resulting sands. This process is less effective in the eastern part of the depression, due to lower salinity groundwater.&lt;ref name="Geomorphology"&gt;Aref M.A.M., El-Khoriby E., Hamdan M.A. 15 June 2002. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X01001520 ''The role of salt weathering in the origin of the Qattara Depression, Western Desert, Egypt'']. Geomorphology, Volume 45, Issues 3-4, Pages 181-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:Qattara Depression (March 2007).jpg|thumb|200px|View of the Qattara Depression]]
[[File:Sand Dunes (Qattara Depression).jpg|thumb|200px|Sand dunes in the Qattara Depression]]

Groves of ''[[Acacia]] raddiana'', growing in shallow sandy depressions, and ''[[Phragmites]]'' swamps represent the only permanent vegetation. The acacia groves vary widely in [[biodiversity]] and rely on runoff from rainfall and groundwater to survive. The [[Moghra Oasis]] in the northeastern part of the Depression has a four&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; brackish lake and a ''Phragmites'' swamp.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Hughes, R. H. and J. S. Hughes. 1992. ''A Directory of African Wetlands''. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland. {{ISBN|2-88032-949-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nora Berrahmouni and Burgess, Neil. 2001. {{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0905|name=Saharan halophytics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southwestern corner of the depression is part of the [[Siwa Protected Area]] which protects the wild oasis in and around the [[Siwa Oasis]].

The Depression is an important habitat for the [[cheetah]], with the largest number of recent sightings being in areas in the northern, western and northwestern part of the Qattara Depression, including the highly isolated, wild oases of Ain EI Qattara and Ein EI Ghazzalat and numerous acacia groves both inside and outside the depression.&lt;ref name="Cheetah"&gt;Saleh, M.A., Helmy, I. and Giegengack. 2001. ''The Cheetah, "Acinonyx jubatus" (Schreber, 1776) in Egypt (Felidae, Acinonychinae)''. "Mammalia" 65 (2): 177-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gazelle]]s (''Gazella dorcas'' and ''Gazella leptoceros'') also inhabit the Qattara Depression, being an important food source for the cheetah. The largest gazelle population exists in the southwestern part of the Qattara Depression within a vast area of [[wetlands]] and soft sand. The area of {{convert|900|km2|sqmi}}, includes the wild oases of Hatiyat Tabaghbagh and Hatiyat Umm Kitabain, and is a mosaic of [[lake]]s, [[salt marsh]]es, [[scrubland]], wild [[Arecaceae|palm]] groves and ''[[Desmostachya bipinnata]]'' [[grassland]].&lt;ref name="Cheetah" /&gt;

Other common fauna include the [[Cape hare]] (''Lepus capensis''), [[golden jackal|Egyptian jackal]] (''Canis aureus hupstar''), [[Rüppell's fox|sand fox]] (''Vulpes rueppelli'') and more rarely the [[fennec fox]] (''Vulpes zerda''). [[Barbary sheep]] (''Ammotragus lervia'') were once common here but now they are few in numbers.

Extinct species from the area include the [[scimitar oryx]] (''Oryx dammah''), [[addax]] (''Addax nasomaculatus'') and [[bubal hartebeest]] (''Alcelaphus buselaphus'').&lt;ref&gt;Manlius, M., Menardi-Noguera, A. and Andras Zboray, A. 2003. ''Decline of the Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) in Egypt during the 20th century: literature review and recent observations.'' J. Zool. (London) 259: 403–409.&lt;/ref&gt; Also the ''[[Droseridites]] baculatus'', an extinct plant known only from fossils of its pollen, was found at the [[Ghazalat-1 Well]].&lt;ref name=Ibrahim&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ibrahim | first1 = M.I.A. | year = 1996 | title = Aptian-Turonian palynology of the Ghazalat-1 Well (GTX-1), Qattara Depression, Egypt | url = | journal = Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology | volume = 94 | issue = 1–2| pages = 137–168 | doi = 10.1016/0034-6667(95)00135-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==

The climate of the Qattara Depression is highly arid with annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] between 25 and 50&amp;nbsp;mm on the northern rim to less than 25&amp;nbsp;mm in the south of the depression. The average daily temperature varies between {{convert|36.2|to|6.2|C|F}} during summer and winter months. The prevailing wind forms a largely bimodal regime with most wind coming from north easterly and westerly directions. This causes the linear dune formations in the Western desert between the Qattara Depression and the Nile valley. Wind speeds peak in March with of 11.5&amp;nbsp;m/s (25.7&amp;nbsp;mph) and minimal in December with 3.2&amp;nbsp;m/s (7.2&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name="Geomorphology"/&gt;
The average wind speed is about 5–6&amp;nbsp;m/s (11.2-13.4&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=windatlas&gt;Mortensen N.G, Said U.S, Badger J. 2006. ''Wind Atlas for Egypt: Measurements, Micro- and Mesoscale Modeling.'' New and Renewable Energy Authority, Cairo, Egypt&lt;/ref&gt; Several days each year in the months March to May [[khamsin | khamsin winds]] blow in from the south and bringing extremely high temperatures as well as sand and dust with them.

==Land use==
There is one permanent settlement in the Qattara Depression, the [[Qara Oasis]]. The oasis is located in the westernmost part of the depression and is inhabited by about 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;Kjeilen, Tore [http://looklex.com/egypt/qara.htm ''Looklex report on the Qara oasis''], date unknown&lt;/ref&gt; The Depression is also inhabited by the nomadic [[Bedouin]] people and their flocks, with the uninhabited Moghra oasis being important in times of [[water scarcity]] during the dry seasons.

The Qattara Depression contains many oil concessions, and several operational [[oil field]]s. The drilling companies include [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and the [[Apache Corporation]].

==History==

=== Measurement ===
The altitude of the depression was first measured in 1917 by an officer of the British Army leading a light car patrol into the region. The officer took readings of the height of the terrain with an [[barometer|aneroid barometer]] on behalf of John Ball, who later would also publish on the region. He discovered that the spring Ain EI Qattara lay about {{convert|60|m|ft}} below sea level. Because the barometer got lost and the readings were so unexpected, this find had to be verified. During 1924-25, Ball again organised a survey party, this time with the sole purpose to [[triangulate]] the elevation on a westerly line from [[Wadi El Natrun]]. The survey was led by G.F. Walpole who had already distinguished himself by triangulating the terrain across {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Nile]] to [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] via [[Bahariya]]. He confirmed the earlier readings and proved the presence of a huge area below sea level, with places as deep as {{convert|-133|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="El Bassyony" /&gt;

Knowledge about the geology of the Qattara Depression was greatly extended by [[Ralph Alger Bagnold]], a British military commander and explorer, through numerous journeys in the 1920s and 1930s. Most notable was his 1927 journey during which he crossed the depression east to west and visited the oases of [[Qara Oasis|Qara]] and [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]]. Many of these trips used motor vehicles (Ford Model-Ts) which used special techniques for driving in desert conditions. These techniques were an important asset of the [[Long Range Desert Group]] which Bagnold founded in 1940.&lt;ref name="Bagnold1"&gt;Bagnold, R.A. 1931. ''Journeys in the Libyan Desert, 1929 and 1930''. The Geographical Journal 78(1): 13-39; (6):524-533.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of the depression, Ball published the triangulation findings about the region on October 1927 in [[The Geographical Journal]]. He also gave the region its name "Qattara" after the spring Ain EI Qattara where the first readings were taken. The name literally means "dripping" in Arabic. Six years later in 1933, Ball was the first to publish a proposal for flooding the region to generate hydroelectric power in his article "The Qattara Depression of the Libyan Desert and the possibility of its utilisation for power-production".&lt;ref name="El Bassyony" /&gt;

===World War II===

During [[World War II]], the depression's presence shaped the [[First Battle of El Alamein|1st]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|2nd Battles of El Alamein]]. It was considered impassable by [[tanks]] and most other [[military]] [[vehicle]]s because of features such as salt lakes, high cliffs and/or escarpments, and [[fech fech]] (very fine powdered sand). The cliffs in particular acted as an edge of the El Alamein battlefield, which meant the [[British Empire]]'s forces could not be [[flanking manoeuvre|outflanked]] to the south. Both Axis and Allied forces built their defences in a line from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the Qattara Depression. These defences became known as the [[Devil's gardens]], and they are for the most part still there, especially the extensive minefields. 

No large army units entered the Depression, although German [[Afrika Korps]] patrols and the British [[Long Range Desert Group]] did operate in the area, since these small units had considerable experience in desert travel.&lt;ref name="Bagnold1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C. (2003). ''Rommel's panzers: Rommel and the Panzer forces of the Blitzkrieg, 1940-1942'' (pp. 78–79). St. Paul, MN: MBI.&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF's repair and salvage units (e.g. 58 RSU) used a route through the depression to salvage or recover [[aircraft]] that had landed or crashed in the Western desert away from the coastal plain. 

The RSUs included a six-wheel-drive trucks, Coles cranes, and large trailers, and were particularly active from mid-1941 when [[Air Vice-Marshal]] G.G. Dawson arrived in Egypt to address the lack of serviceable aircraft. &lt;ref&gt;Richards, D., Saunders, H. (1975). ''Royal Air Force 1939-45'' Vol II (pp 160-167). Stationery Office Books&lt;/ref&gt;

A German communications officer stationed in the depression was cited by [[Gordon Welchman]] as being unintentionally helpful in the breaking of the [[Enigma machine]] code, due to his regular transmissions stating there was "nothing to report".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Lloyd|title=WWII: Crucible of the Contemporary World : Commentary and Readings|year=1991|publisher=M.E.

==Qattara Depression Project==
{{Main|Qattara Depression Project}}

The large size of the Qattara Depression and the fact that it falls to a depth of 133 meters below mean sea level has led to several proposals to create a massive [[hydroelectric power]] project in northern Egypt rivalling that of the [[Aswan High Dam]]. This project is known as the [[Qattara Depression Project]]. The proposals call for a large canal or tunnel being excavated from the Qattara due north of {{convert|55|to|80|km|mi}} depending on the route chosen to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to bring seawater into the area.&lt;ref&gt;Ragheb, M. 2010.

An alternative plan involved running a 320 kilometre (200 mile) pipeline northeast to the [[freshwater]] [[Nile River]] at [[Rosetta]].&lt;ref name=nileQ&gt;Mahmoud, Mohamed. [http://www.medjmc.com/mahmoud/qattara.html ''The River Nile - Qattara Depression Pipeline''], June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map&gt;User:TGCP [http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=31%b024N+30%b025E+-++30%b00%26%238242;N+27%b030%26%238242;E ''Great Circle Mapper - Rosetta to Qattara'']&lt;!--using coordinates given--&gt;, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Water would flow into a series of water [[penstock]]s which would generate electricity by releasing the water at 60 m below sea level. Because the Qattara Depression is in a very hot dry region with very little cloud cover, the water released at the {{convert|-70|m|ft}} level would spread out from the release point across the basin and evaporate from solar influx. Because of evaporation, more water can flow into the depression, thus forming a continual source of power. Eventually this would result in a hypersaline lake or a salt pan as the water would evaporate and leave behind the salt that it contained.

Plans to use the Qattara Depression for the generation of electricity date back to 1912 &lt;!-- this publication (behind paywall) says it was year 1916 --&gt; from Berlin geographer Professor [[Albrecht Penck|Penck]].&lt;ref name=Peace&gt;Murakami M. [http://library.northsouth.edu/Upload/Managing%20Water%20for%20Peace.pdf ''Managing water for peace in the Middle East'']{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} United Nations University Press. p.64-66&lt;/ref&gt; The subject was discussed in more detail by Dr. John Ball in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, John. 1927. ''"Problems of the Libyan Desert: Geographical Journal"''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] proposed to President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] that peace in the Middle East could be achieved by flooding the Qattara Depression. The resulting lagoon, according to the CIA, would have four benefits:&lt;ref&gt;MI: Gale. 2009. Farmington Hills, ''CIA Suggestions, Document Number CK3100127026''. Reproduced in "Declassified Documents Reference System"&lt;/ref&gt;

*It would be "spectacular and peaceful".
*It would "materially alter the climate in adjacent areas".
*It would "provide work during construction and living areas after completion for the [[Palestinian Arabs]]".
*It would get [[Egypt]]ian president [[Gamel Abdel Nasser]]'s "mind on other matters" because "he need[ed] some way to get off the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] hook".

In the 1970s and early 1980s, several proposals to flood the area were made by [[Friedrich Bassler]] and the ''Joint Venture Qattara'', a group of mainly German companies. They wanted to make use of [[peaceful nuclear explosions]] to construct a tunnel, drastically reducing construction costs compared to conventional methods. This project proposed to use 213 [[H-bombs]], with yields of one to 1.5 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]]s, detonated at depths of {{convert|100|to|500|m|ft}}. This fit within the [[Atoms for Peace|Atoms for Peace program]] proposed by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in 1953. Because it was frightened by this plan, the Egyptian government turned down the idea. &lt;ref&gt;Badescu, Viorel. 2011.

{{Use Indian English|date=November 2015}}
The '''renaming of cities in India''' started in 1947 following the end of the [[British Raj|British imperial period]]. Several changes were controversial, and not all proposed changes were implemented.  Each had to be approved by the [[Government of India|central government]] in [[New Delhi]].

The '''renaming of states and territories''' in India has also taken place, but until recently with actual substantial name changes in both local language and in English such as the old British state name of Travancore-Cochin to [[Kerala]] (1956). The most notable recent exceptions are Indian English spelling-changes of ''Orissa'' to [[Odisha]] (March 2011)&lt;ref&gt;India and the World Bank: The Politics of Aid and Influence - Page 126 Jason A. Kirk - 2011 "Orissa (Note: This state was officially renamed Odisha in March 2011)"&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Union Territory of Pondicherry'' (which includes the [[Pondicherry (city)|City of Pondicherry]]) to [[Puducherry]].

==Renaming in local languages==
In the post-colonial era, several Indian states' names were changed. Some of these changes coincided with the [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956, a major reform of the boundaries of India's states and territories that organised them along linguistic lines. At this time, for example, Travancore-Cochin was renamed [[Kerala]]. Later state name changes include the reorganisation of Madhya Bharat into [[Madhya Pradesh]] in 1959;&lt;ref&gt;''The Hindu Nationalist Movement and Indian Politics, 1925 to the 1990s.'' - Page 134 Christophe Jaffrelot 1999 - "The new state included Madhya Bharat, the Bhopal region, the former Vindhya Pradesh, Mahakoshal and Chhattisgarh (the last two regions forming the Hindi-speaking parts in the former Madhya Pradesh; see map, pp. xxii-xxiii)."&lt;/ref&gt; and the renamings of the [[Madras State]] to [[Tamil Nadu]] in 1969, of the [[Mysore State]] to [[Karnataka]] in 1973, and of Uttaranchal to [[Uttarakhand]] in 2007.

Name changes have varied with respect to the levels of language at which they have been applied, and also accepted. Some of these local name changes were changes made in all languages: the immediate local name, and also all India's other languages. An example of this is the renaming of predominantly Hindi-speaking Uttaranchal ({{lang-hi|उत्तराञ्चल}}) to a new local Hindi name ({{lang-hi|उत्तराखण्ड|link=no}} ''Uttarakhand''). Other changes were only changes in some of the indigenous languages. For example, the renaming of the [[Madras Presidency]] to [[Madras State]] in 1947 and then Tamil Nadu in 1969 required non-Tamil speakers to change from an approximation of the British name ({{lang-ta|மதராஸ் மாகாணம்}} ''Madras Presidency'', then  ''Madras State'' {{lang-ta|மதராஸ் மாநிலம்|link=no}}) to a native Tamil name ({{lang-ta|தமிழ்நாடு|link=no}} ''Tamil Nadu'', "Tamil land").

In general, changes to the local names of cities in the indigenous languages are less common. However, a change in English may sometimes also be a reflection of changes in other Indian languages other than the specific local one. For example, the change of Madras ({{lang-ta|மதராஸ்|link=no}} ''Madras'') to Chennai ({{lang-ta|சென்னை|link=no}}  ''Chennai'') was reflected in many of India's languages, and incidentally in English, while the Tamil endonym had always been Chennai and remained unaffected by the change. Similarly, Bombay, which was always called 'Mumbai' in Marathi, was restored to Mumbai in 1996.

==Renaming in English==

===Change in official English spelling===
The renaming of cities is often specifically from English to [[Indian English]] in connection with that dialect's internal reforms. In other words, the city itself is not actually renamed in the local language, and the local name (or endonym) in the indigenous [[languages of India]] does not change, but the official spelling in Indian English is amended. An example is the change from English "Calcutta" to English "[[Kolkata]]" – the local Bengali name ({{lang|bn|কলকাতা}} ''Kôlkata'') did not change. Such changes in English spelling may be in order to better reflect a more accurate [[phonetic]] [[transliteration]] of the local name, or may be for other reasons. In the early years after [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], many name changes were effected in northern India for English spellings of Hindi place names that had simply been romanised inconsistently by the British administration – such as the British spelling "Jubbulpore," renamed "[[Jabalpur]]" ({{lang|hi|जबलपुर}}) among the first changes in 1947. These changes did not generate significant controversy. More recent and high-profile changes – including renaming such major cities as Calcutta to Kolkata – have generated greater controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Mira Kamdar ''Planet India: How the Fastest Growing Democracy Is Transforming ... '' 2007 Author's introduction Page xi "India's information-technology capital's new name, should it be adopted, will mean “town of boiled beans.” The name changes are not without controversy among Indians. In several instances, the name change represents a struggle between a cosmopolitan elite and a local, regional-language populace over defining the city in ways that go far beyond a simple change of name."&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence, such changes have typically been enacted officially by legislation at local or national [[Government of India|Indian government]] level, and may or may not then be adopted by the [[Media of India|Indian media]], particularly the influential [[List of newspapers in India by readership|Indian press]]. In the case of smaller towns and districts which were less notable outside and inside India, and where a well known English name (or exonym) could not be said to exist, older spellings used under [[British India]] may not have had any specific legislation other than changes in practice on the romanisation of indigenous Indian language names.

===Realignment of the official Indian English name to an alternative local name===
Aside from changes to the official English spellings of local names there have also been renaming proposals to realign the official name, hence the English name with an alternative local name. Ethnically sensitive examples include the proposals by the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (1990, 2001) to rename [[Ahmedabad]] to Karnavati&lt;ref&gt;Steven I. Wilkinson ''Votes and Violence: Electoral Competition and Ethnic Riots in India''  2006 Page 23 "The BJP proposed in 1990 and 2001 that Ahmedabad be renamed "Karnavati." Hindu, June 1 1, 2001. Similar proposals have been made to restore Allahabad to "Prayag", as it had been known as before the Mughal era.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allahabad]] to [[Prayag]]. These two proposals are changes from the historically Mughal name to a Hindu native name. These can be represented as a change from Urdu language to Hindi language, but since the two languages are variants of Hindustani the proposal is effectively a cultural and ethno-religious proposal rather than a linguistic one.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmopolitanism - Page 73 Carol A. Breckenridge, Sheldon Pollock, Homi K. Bhabha - 2002 "In one sense, the decision to officialise the name ''Mumbai'' is part of a widespread Indian pattern of replacing names associated with colonial rule with names associated with local, national, and regional heroes. It is an indigenizing toponymic."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption of name changes in India and overseas===
Official name changes take place quickly if not immediately in official government sources.&lt;ref&gt;''Reserve Bank of India's instructions for banks &amp; banking operations'' [[Reserve Bank of India]] 2001 Page 713 "The new name "Mumbai" should be reflected in both English and Hindi and the change in name is to be brought about in all official communications, name plates, sign boards, office seals, rubber stamps, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption may be slower among the media in India and abroad, and among Indian authors.&lt;ref&gt;Perveez Mody ''The Intimate State: Love-Marriage and the Law in Delhi'' Page 59  - 2008 "Throughout this book, I refer to India's commercial capital as Bombay rather than Mumbai. ... I am well aware of the name-change effected by an Act of the Indian Parliament in 1997 that made the city officially 'Mumbai'. ... It is the same convention I adopt when referring to Calcutta rather than Kolkata."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pingali Sailaja ''Indian English'' Page 16  2009 "Bombay is now called Mumbai, Madras is now Chennai and Calcutta is Kolkata, in an attempt to de-anglicise them. In this work, the earlier names are retained since these names were used during the period that we mostly cover."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calcutta: A Cultural and Literary History - Page 3 Krishna Dutta - 2003 "nationalist stance, like Bombay, which changed its name to Mumbai, or Madras, which has become the unrecognisable Chennai, Calcutta has preferred a comparatively minor name change, which frankly is a bit of a multicultural mishmash."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need for unification of spelling==
India has various local languages. Even (Romanised) English spellings in long and wide use often vary depending upon which government department or agency uses them. To the point, a few examples are Quilandy vs. [[Koyilandy]], Canannore vs. [[Kannur]], and Rangiya vs. [[Rangiya|Rangia]]. Different departments of the government may have used official spellings in use at the time, while locations associated with Indian railways mostly maintained British-era spellings. The confusion inherent in such variations has often resulted in serious consequences like people having two "different" addresses (theoretically designating the same place) in their official records leading to legal disputes, or one house having residents of different house addresses due to differing place names. Many people argue that such confusion can lead to indeterminate and/or unintended consequences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igovernment.in/opinion/41631/merging-npr-uid?source=igov&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sri Lankan place name etymology''' is characterized by the linguistic and ethnic diversity of the island of [[Sri Lanka]] through the ages and the position of the country in the centre of ancient and medieval sea [[trade route]]s. While typical Sri Lankan placenames of [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] origin vastly dominate, [[toponym]]s which stem from [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] also exist. In the past, the many composite or hybrid place names and the juxtaposition of Sinhala and Tamil placenames reflected the coexistence of people of both language groups. Today, however, toponyms and their [[etymology|etymologies]] are a source of heated political debate in the country as part of the political struggles between the majority [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]]  and [[minority group|minority]] [[Sri Lankan Tamils]].

==Morphological structure of place names==
The [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] structure of Sri Lankan place names by and large depends on the language. Sinhala and Tamil favour transparent [[Compound word|compound]]s involving geological features combined with an animal or plant, while the European languages are more person centered and derive place names from saints or nobility or army.

===Sinhalese===
Place names of Sinhala origin, have a typical X+Y structure, where Y is a geographical feature such as
''mountain'', ''river'' or ''village''
and X is a qualifier, like an animal or plant often found at that place, or otherwise associated with it. Examples for this are

* singha+pitiya "lion place"
* weli+gama "sand village"
* [[Monaragala|monara+gala]] "peacock rock".

Commonly used trees in village names are ''pol'' ([[coconut]]) and ''Kitul'' (palm), among others.

The X part can be complex as in

* [[Kiribathgoda|kiri bath goda]] = milk rice village

The X part can also refer to social concepts like [[caste]]. Examples for this are ''waduwa'' (carpenter), ''batta'' (lower caste settlement), ''ambataya'' (barber), ''aruwa'' ([[Pottery|potter]]), ''goviya'' ([[govigama|farmer]]), ''bamuna'' ([[Brahmin]]) and ''Villiya'' ([[Rodiya]]).&lt;ref name="gnana"&gt;Gnanaprakasar, ''A Critical History of Jaffna'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Y parts already mentioned, other commonly used land usage forms are ''Kumbura'' (paddy fieldds), ''Deniya'', ''watte'' (garden), ''pola'', ''gama'' (village), and ''Hena'' (cultivated lands). Grasslands were termed as ''talava'' and tree groves were termed ''golla''. Village tanks were called ''pokuna'' or ''katuwa''. Irrigation tanks were called ''wewa''.&lt;ref&gt;Gnanaprakasar, ''A Critical History of Jaffna'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Canals from such lakes were called ''aala''. Flat lands were termed ''botha''. Ports were termed ''tota''.&lt;ref&gt;Gnanaprakasar, ''A Critical History of Jaffna'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Names of flower gardens belonging to [[Buddhist]] establishments end with ''uyana''.

===Tamil===
[[File:Negombo.jpg|In both Sinhala and Tamil, coconut trees often lend their names to the places where they are frequently found|right|thumb]]
Place names of Tamil origin, like Sinhala origin, also have a typical X+Y structure.&lt;ref name=k483/&gt;
The place names are simple and descriptive; they reflect criteria normal to early societies and are related to the concepts and outlooks of people of those times. The majority of the place names can be listed under caste and occupational, landforms, land classifications, coastal features, irrigation works, fields and farms, trees, animals, names of deities, personal names, old, new, big, small, good, settlement and village.&lt;ref name=k483&gt;Kularatnam, "Tamil Place Names in Ceylon outside the Northern and Eastern Provinces", p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

The X-part in Tamil place names is often one of the following: The commonly used trees are ''Vembu, Panai'' (palm) and ''Illupai''. Commonly used animals and birds are ''Anai'' (elephant), ''Puli'' (tiger), and ''Kuranku'' (monkey). Other notable classifications are deities such as ''[[Amman]]'', ''Andi'', ''[[Kali]]'' and ''[[Pillaiyar]]''.&lt;ref name=k484&gt;Kularatnam, "Tamil Place Names in Ceylon outside the Northern and Eastern Provinces", p. 484–492&lt;/ref&gt;
The commonly used caste or ethnic titles in Tamil are ''[[Chetty]], [[Vannan]]'' and ''[[Tamil people|Demala]]''.

As for the Y-part, the  commonly used landforms ''Mulai or Mulla'' (corner), ''Malai or Male'' (mountain), ''Aru'' (creek),  ''Kuda'' (bay) ''Manal'' (sandy place), ''Kuli'' (depression), ''Tivu'' (island),  ''Pallam'' (depression) and ''Ur'' or ''uruwa'' (village).&lt;ref name=k484/&gt; Land classification are ''Tottam'' (garden), ''Kudal'' (bay), ''Puval, Kadu'' (forest), ''Munai'' or ''Mune'' (front), ''Karai'' (coast) and ''Turai'' or ''Ture'' (port). Irrigation and agriculture classifications are ''Kulam'' or ''Kulama'' (tank), reflecting the most common village name endings in [[Anuradhapura District|Anuradhapura]] and [[Puttalam District|Puttalam]] [[Districts of Sri Lanka|districts]],&lt;ref name=k484/&gt; ''Kinaru'' (well), ''Kani'' (allotment), ''Vayal'' (paddy field), ''Vaikkal'' (canal) and ''Eri'' (tank).

===Portuguese===
[[File:Wolfendahl church.jpg|thumb|left|Wolfendahl [[Dutch Reformed]] Church]]
The Portuguese, who came to the [[Portuguese Ceylon|island in 1505 and left in 1658]], often gave names of Saints to whom the churches in the vicinity were dedicated. ''San Sebastian Hill'' and ''St. Joseph's Road'' are examples of these and ''Milagiriya'' had the church of Our Lady of Miracles (''milagre'' in Portuguese).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

A name like "Grand Pass", a northern suburb of Colombo, is the English rendering of "Grande Passo", the name of a ferry established by the Portuguese, to cross the Kelani River.

[[Point Pedro]] and [[Mount Pedro]] are also place names with the name of a Portuguese person as a component, although they might have been coined by the British.

The Portuguese language furthermore was an important step stone for the English terms used today, the British would often use Portuguese names and adapt them, rather than taking the original form. An example for this is [[Batticaloa]], and [[Ceylon]] itself.

===Dutch===
The [[Dutch Ceylon|Dutch rule the maritime provinces from 1658-1796]]. Amongst their legacy place names of Dutch origin although not many are still significant. For example, ''Hulftsdorp'' which is Dutch for 'Hulft's Village' and named after the Dutch general [[Gerard Pietersz. Hulft]].

Among the other place-names in Colombo which are of Dutch origin may be included ''Bloemendahl'' (Vale of Flowers) and ''Wolvendahl'' (Vale of Wolves). The latter was known as 'Guadelupe' by the Portuguese, which the Dutch took to mean 'Agua de lupe' which they translated accordingly.  It is still known as 'aadelippu' in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].

The ''Beira lake'' in Colombo probably takes its name from De Beer who is believed to have been an engineer in charge of the Dutch water defenses. A
granite plaque inscribed with the words 'De Beer 1700' recovered from an old Dutch sluice which controlled the flow of water from the lake has altered the hitherto accepted view that the lake takes its name from the Portuguese ''beira'' meaning 'bank or edge (of a lake)'.

The '[[Maliban Biscuit Manufactories Limited|Maliban]]' biscuit brand gets its name from the Maliban Hotel, which AG Hinni Appuhamy started at Maliban St, [[Pettah, Colombo|Pettah]] (now AG Hinniappuhamy Mawatha) - originally Maliebaan Straat, named for [[Maliebaan]], the [[Paille-maille|Pall Mall]] alley  in [[Utrecht]]. Leyn Baan Street in [[Galle]] is from 'lijnbaan', meaning 'rope walk' or 'ropery'.

The Dutch also christened  the  islands of Jaffna in remembrance of Dutch towns, such as ''[[Islands of Sri Lanka#Jaffna Peninsula|Hoorn, Delft, Leiden, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Middelburg and Enkhuizen]]'', but these names (with the exception of Delft) have all but disappeared and have been replaced by their local [[Tamil language|Tamil]] names.

===English===
[[File:The fort railway station colombo.jpg|Fort Railway station in Colombo bears an English name|thumb]]
The [[United Kingdom|British]] who followed the Dutch  left many place names within the capital Colombo city, like streets, squares and quarters, but their influence on larger geographical features like towns is limited. Within Colombo, many of the place names   have a British royal connotation, such as ''Queen's Street, Prince Street, Duke Street''. The quarters Fort, [[Cinnamon Gardens]], [[Slave Island]] and [[Mount Lavinia]] carry English names, next to the native ones.

Outside of Colombo, English influence can be found in the tea planting region with the towns of [[Hatton, Sri Lanka|Hatton]] and [[Dalhousie, Sri Lanka|Dalhousie]], and several estates such as ''Devon'',''Kenilworth'', ''Middleton'', ''Somerset'', ''Usk Valley'' and ''Wavenden''. [[Scots English]] is also widely represented by place names such as ''Blinkbonnie'', ''Holyrood'', ''Lauderdale'', ''Melfort'' and ''Sutherland''.

[[Horton Plains]] were named for Sir [[Robert John Wilmot-Horton]], the [[Governor of Ceylon]], who adopted the surname of his wife, Anne Beatrix Horton. Horton Place in Colombo is also named for him.

===Gaelic===
[[Scottish people|Scottish]] planters named many of the areas they planted after [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] place names from [[Scotland]]. Examples are [[Aberdeen, Sri Lanka|Aberdeen]], Balmoral, Clyde, Culloden, Frotoft, Kinross, Perth and Strathspey.

===Malay===
[[Ja-Ela]], Javanese Canal

===Algonquian===
Probably the only [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] place name in Sri Lanka is Rappahannock, in [[Uda Pussellawa]]. It comes from the [[Rappahannock River]] in [[Virginia]], itself originating from an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word, lappihanne (also recorded as toppehannock), meaning "river of quick, rising water" or "where the tide ebbs and flows," the name used by the local native population, the Rappahannock tribe.

===Vedda===
The common word ''Gala'' for stones found in Sinhalese is considered to be a borrowing from indigenous [[Vedda language]]. It is used in [[Toponyms]] found throughout the island.

===Arabic===
Place names in Arabic also exist throughout scattered pockets in Sri Lanka where substantial populations of Sri Lankan Moors reside. According to the location Arabic place names are often mixed with Sinhala or Tamil morphological naming conventions. For example,   the town of Katthankudy in Eastern Sri Lanka is thought to be named after an Arab settler named "Al Qahtan".

==Origins of some well-known place names==

===Big towns===
[[File:Colombo - Lake.jpg|thumb|The Beira Lake in the ''Slave Island'' area in Colombo]]
* [[Colombo]]:   Derived from ''Kolamba'' an indigenous Vedda word for harbor or fort, borrowed by Sinhalese. However, the Portuguese were probably struck by its similarity to the name of Colombus, and renamed the city 'Colombo'.
*  '[[Kandy]]' is an abbreviation of 'Kanda Udarata', or 'hill country' which was the seat of the later Sinhala kings.
* [[Galle]]: Galle was known as Gimhathitha in ancient times. The term is believed to be derived from the classical Sinhalese term meaning "port near the river Gin".
* [[Trincomalee]]: Also known as Thirukonemalee in Tamil, is derived from the [[honorific]] [[prefix]] used while addressing adult males in Tamil, being the equivalent of the [[English language|English]] "[[Mr.|Mr]]" and from the words "Kone" meaning King and Malee meaning mountain in Tamil. 
* [[Batticaloa]] meaning of: Land of the singing fish.
[[File:Jaffnalibrary1-edit1.jpg|thumb|130px|left|[[Jaffna Library|Public Library]], Jaffna]]
*'''[[Jaffna]]''' is the English rendering of Yazhpanam (யாழ்ப்பாணம்) in Tamil meaning "town of the harper"
[[Archaeologist]] [[Paranavithana]] suggests that the original name was ''Javapatuna'', where 'Java' alludes to the presence of [[Javaka]] people. The Portuguese historian De Queyroz refers to it at 'Jafanapataõ', which he says is said by some to be a corrupted form of 'Jafana-en-Putalam', or "Town of the Lord Jafana", and by others to be derived from 'Jafana-Patanaõture' meaning "long harbour".&lt;ref&gt;Fernaõ De Queyroz, ''The Temporal and Spiritual Conquest of Ceylon'', translated by S.G. Perera, Government Printer of Ceylon, Colombo: 1930 Vol I at pp. 47-48.  The translator, in his notes to De Queyroz's text, tentatively cites the Tamil phrases ''Yalppananin-paddanam'' and ''Talvana-paddanat-turai'' in connection with these names.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Akkaraipattu'''meaning - Ten Cities after the River.

===Touristic places===
* [[Polonnaruwa]]
* [[Anuradhapura]]
* [[Sigiriya]]: derived from the structure — Sīhā giri, the Lion Rock.
* [[Mihintale]] is derived from "Mihindu" (the arahat monk who brought [[Buddhism]] to Sri Lanka) + "thalaya" (highland). It is mentioned in [[Buddhist]] culture, that arahat monk "Mihindu" appeared on top of a high rock which is today known as Mihintale, and preached Buddhist teachings to then king of Sri Lanka, Devanampiyathissa.
* [[Negombo]]
* [[Hikkaduwa]]
* [[Unawatuna]]
* [[Ambalangoda]]
* [[Bentota]]
* [[Tangalle]]
* [[Nilaweli]]
* [[Nuwara Eliya]] means "city of light" in Sinhala

==Geolinguistic distribution==
As already stated above, European place names are found mainly in the big towns which used to be colonial centers. On the countryside, there is close to no European toponymy and the indigenous languages are dominant.

Given the very similar processes of place name formation in Sinhala and Tamil explicated above, it is not always easy to establish the original language of a place name, because [[loan translation]]s are common in both directions. For such an alleged example of loan translation, see the case of Trincomalee above. Additionally, some place names draw on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Pali]] roots, which are then adapted to Sinhala and Tamil phonology in different ways. These intricacies must be taken into account when evaluating claims that a certain area was predominantly inhabited by one group or the other at a certain point in time.

Taking a [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] point of view, Sinhala place names are more common in the Sinhala speaking areas in the South, whereas Tamil place names are more common in the Tamil speaking areas in the North and East. On a [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] point of view, things are more complicated, and both Sinhala settlements in the North and Tamil settlements in the South have been claimed to have been more common in the past. The motivation behind such analyses is not always scientific;  political goals also play a role in claiming a certain area for a certain language group, see the next section for more discussion of this. The following statements have to be interpreted with this caveat in mind.

Sinhalese place names are found throughout the island. As discussed by Sri Lankan historians such as Paul E Peiris, [[Karthigesu Indrapala]] and others, pre-[[Christianity|Christian]] stone inscriptions of Sri Lanka point to the extensive use of the Sinhala language in local administration. Much of the information for tracing the old place names comes from etymology, written texts, many stone inscriptions which are in Sinhala and dating back to pre-Christian times, as well as the more recent colonial records.

Dutch and British records show that the language of the inhabitants of [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] in the 17th and 18th centuries were [[Tamil language|Tamil]], while none of them considered Tamils to be native to the island, and state that the Tamils had come from the opposite coast and displaced the Sinhalese.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=An Historical Relation Of the Island Ceylon |author= Robert Knox |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14346/14346-h/14346-h.htm |accessdate=2011-11-03|quote=Besides the Dutch who possess, as I judge, about one fourth of the Island, there are Malabars, that are free Denizons and pay duty to the King for the Land they enjoy, as the Kings natural Subjects do; there are also Moors, who are like Strangers, and hold no Land, but live by carrying goods to the Sea-Ports, which now are in the Hollanders hands. The Sea-Ports are inhabited by a mixt people, Malabars and Moors, and some that are black, who profess themselves Roman Catholicks, and wear Crosses, and use Beads. Some of these are under the Hollander; and pay toll and tribute to them. '''But I am to speak only of the natural proper People of the Island, which they call Chingulays.''' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to M. Chelvadurai(a Tamil) only Tamil words were used for natural and human-made features in the [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] region with no trace of Sinhalese words,&lt;ref&gt;Chelvadurai, M. ''The Sri Lankan Tamils'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt; while Vanni itself is a Sinhala word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=A comparative dictionary of Indo-Aryan languages. London: Oxford University Press |url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:1465.soas.1399391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor K. Kularatnam, when analyzing the regional distribution of place names in Sri Lanka, one not only comes across Tamil names in areas which are Sinhala-speaking, and vice versa, but also composite or hybrid place names which are part Sinhalese and part Tamil in composition, as well as Sinhalese and Tamil place names juxtaposed within small areas.&lt;ref name=k483/&gt;

Most hybrid place names are found in the traditionally Sinhalese [[North Western Province, Sri Lanka|North Western]] and [[North Central Province, Sri Lanka|North Central]] [[Provinces of Sri Lanka|provinces]], as well as the traditionally Tamil [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern]] and [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern]] provinces.

[[Sigiri]] graffiti verses referring to the Jaffna peninsula and written c. 8th century, contain references to ''Vaeligama'',&lt;ref name=Paranavitana1956&gt;{{Cite book| author = Paranavitana, S. | year = 1956 | title = Sigiri Graffiti, Vols. I &amp; II | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}
Kularatnam concluded from the hybrid place names that the traditionally Sinhalese North Central and North Western Provinces, as well as the coastal tracts as far as south as [[Colombo]], were inhabited by Tamil-speaking people in the past.&lt;ref name=k493/&gt; In addition, there have been also at least small segments elsewhere in the island.&lt;ref name=k493/&gt; The many composite or hybrid place names and the juxtaposition of Sinhala and Tamil place names indicated the peaceful coexistence of people of both language groups.&lt;ref name=k493&gt;Kularatnam, "Tamil Place Names in Ceylon outside the Northern and Eastern Provinces", p. 493&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropological and political relevance of place names in Sri Lanka==
{{See also|Origins of the Sri Lankan civil war|Sri Lankan civil war}}
Place names are a source of controversy in Sri Lankan politics. According to Nissan &amp; Stirrat, the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] is an outcome of how modern ethnic identities have been made and re-made since the colonial period, with the political struggle between minority [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] and the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]]-dominant government accompanied by rhetorical wars over [[archeological]] sites and [[place name]] [[etymologies]], and the political use of the national past.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Both sides in the present political context back up their respective claims through the selective use of histories and through the selective and competitive use of archeological evidence. Factions on each side have been willing to destroy, or reinterpret, evidence which would support the other party. Differing maps are produced which purport to show the distribution of Sinhala and Tamil in Lanka during past centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Nissan and RL Stirrat "The generation of communal identities" in Spencer, ''Sri Lanka: History and the Roots of Conflict'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They  further note  that in the currently Tamil-dominant [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]] there are place names with Sinhalese etymologies, which is used by the Sinhala dominant government to claim the territory, whereas Tamils using Tamil place names in rationally Sinhala areas point to their antiquity in the island.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, ''Sri Lanka: History and the Roots of Conflict'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ebooks.ebookmall.com/title/sri-lanka-spencer-ebooks.htm|title= Sri Lanka Summary.|accessdate=2008-05-08 |work= Jonathan Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a movement in Sri Lanka that seeks to use original Sinhala names  throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Travesty of our place names |author=Perera, D. G. A. |url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/061112/Plus/pls13.html |accessdate=2008-03-06|quote=Sinhala language and its nomenclature was precise and meaningful. That was why even the English and Burgher lawyers are known to have preferred to have their land deeds drawn up in the Sinhala language.Therefore, giving attention to the preparation of an officially recognised list of all place names in the island, is of paramount importance. The Tamils can continue to pronounce the place names in their own way if they choose to do so, but the official spelling remains unchanged. Under British rule, the original Sinhala names of tea, rubber (and even coconut) estates were replaced by English ones, for the most part. But the Tamil estate workers who came from India coined their own names for each of these estates. The Ferguson’s Directory listed all these estate names in English and Tamil, while most of the original Sinhala names were allowed to be forgotten.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development of the place name controversies==
In the 1920s, two historical descriptions of Jaffna were published, ''Ancient Jaffna'' by C. Rasanayagam,  and ''A Critical History of Jaffna'' by Swamy Gnanaprakasar.&lt;ref name="gnana"/&gt; A main claim of these books was that the North and East were hereditary possessions of the Tamils.{{Dubious|date=November 2008}}Upon the  establishment of the University of Ceylon under the  Indian historian H. C. Ray, and the archeologist S. [[Paranavithana]], these claims were re-examined by Sinhalese academics. An issue of the [[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]] in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (ceylon Branch), vol III, p174-224 (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; examined the findings of Rasanaygam et al. and gave different interpretations.

[[File:O.S.A. book spine title.JPG|thumb|160px|''Old Statistical Account'']]
The '''''Statistical Accounts of Scotland''''' are a series of documentary publications, related in subject matter though published at different times, covering life in Scotland in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.

The ''Old (or First) Statistical Account of Scotland'' was published between 1791 and 1799 by [[Sir John Sinclair|Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster]]. The ''New (or Second) Statistical Account of Scotland'' published under the auspices of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] between 1834 and 1845. These first two Statistical Accounts of Scotland are among the finest European contemporary records of life during the [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural]] and [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolutions]].&lt;ref name=EDINA&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of Statistical Accounts of Scotland|url=http://edina.ac.uk/stat-acc-scot/description.html|work=[[EDINA]]|publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]|accessdate=9 October 2012|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Third Statistical Account of Scotland'' was published between 1951 and 1992.

==Early attempts==
[[File:O.S.A. Population Table Pencaitland.jpg|thumb|160px|O.S.A. Population table for [[Pencaitland]], [[East Lothian]]]]
[[File:O.S.A. Life expectancy Tranent.jpg|thumb|160px|O.S.A. Life expectancy table for [[Tranent]], [[East Lothian]]]]
[[File:O.S.A. Rent-Produce Cramond.jpg|thumb|160px|O.S.A. Rent &amp; Produce for [[Cramond]], [[Midlothian]]]] 
Attempts at getting an accurate picture of the geography, people and economy of Scotland had been attempted in the 1620s and 1630s, using the network of about 900 ministers of the established [[Church of Scotland]]. The time and resources involved, not to mention the troubled times of the [[English Civil War|Civil Wars]], led to limited results.

===Sir Robert Sibbald (1684–1690s)===
However, the [[Geographer Royal for Scotland]], [[Robert Sibbald|Sir Robert Sibbald]] took this forward between 1684 and the early 1690s. Sir Robert circulated some "General Queries" to parish ministers, but again this was the unsettled time of the [[Glorious Revolution]] and, though progress was made, the results provided a very incomplete picture of the nation.

===The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (1720–1755)===
The General Assembly proposed a "Geographical Description of Scotland" and took some action on this between 1720 and 1744, again during troubled times for the country, latterly involving the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite rebellion]] under [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]. Nonetheless, during 1743, the [[Moderator of the General Assembly]], the Rev Robert Wallace organised the distribution of questionnaires, aimed at finding out how to devise a scheme for the support of the widows and orphans of clergy. This work helped to develop [[actuarial]] methods, and explains the involvement of a society for ministers’ widows and orphans in later work.

The Rev [[Alexander Webster]] produced a population census of Scotland in 1755, based to some extent on Wallace's work.

===Sir James Steuart (1767) and David Erskine (1781)===
In 1767, Sir [[James Denham-Steuart]] suggested a national survey in his "Enquiry into the principles of Œconomy" and this was taken up in 1781 by [[David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan|David Erskine]], [[Earl of Buchan]]. However, by the time this came to fruition in 1792, it had been overtaken by the work of [[John Sinclair (writer)|Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster]].

==The First (Old) Statistical Account of Scotland==

[[Sir John Sinclair, 1st Baronet|Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster]] had studied German state surveys and wished to use what he called for the first time these "statistical" methods to measure the quantum of happiness that existed in the nation and find ways of improving this. In this he was a remarkable example of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] idealism at work. He stressed the empirical ideal of that age by lauding its anxious attention to the facts and he set about completing the work left unachieved by the previous attempt mentioned above. The results are crucial to an understanding of Scotland on the eve of both the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].

In 1790, Sir John sent structured questionnaires to over 900 parish ministers, covering the whole country. This contained 160 questions in 4 sections, namely

* Geography and topography
* Population
* Agricultural and Industrial production
* Miscellaneous questions

There were follow up questions in Appendices – six new questions in 1790 and four more in 1791. The general response was excellent, though the length and quality of submissions varied greatly, as can be seen by comparing those for two East Lothian parishes: [[Whittingehame]] (19 pages with detailed tables) and [[Stenton]] (2 pages of minimal information). Since the survey was not complete, Sir John sent out ''Statistical Missionaries'' in 1796 . The project was finished by June 1799, though much had already been published, and Sir John was able to lay before the General Assembly a detailed portrait of the nation. Taken as a whole, the reports are of inestimable historical value. Some are excellently written by ministers who were themselves meticulous Enlightenment scholars (see for example the response by the [[James Meek|''Rev Dr James Meek'']] for the Parish of  [[Cambuslang]] in [[Lanarkshire]]).

The finished volumes were published in [[Edinburgh]] by [[William Creech]].&lt;ref&gt;Statistical Accounts of Scotland: Sir John Sinclair&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Second (New) Statistical Account of Scotland==

As mentioned above, early attempts at producing an accurate statistical account of Scotland were related to schemes to support the widows and orphans of the clergy. In 1832 the ''Committee for the Society for the Sons and Daughters of the Clergy'', with the blessing of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], took Sir John's work further. It was to be more modern (including maps for each county) and was to draw upon the specialist knowledge of local doctors and schoolmasters. It very self-consciously set out not to produce a new statistical account, but a statistical account of a new country – one that the revolutions mentioned above had changed rapidly. It was, however, very much the child of the "Old Statistical Account". Indeed, the [[John Robertson, Minister|Rev Dr John Robertson]], the Minister responsible for of the new account for [[Cambuslang]], was the  former assistant to the [[James Meek|writer of the old account]].

=={{anchor|Third Statistical Account of Scotland}}The Third Statistical Account of Scotland==

Following a grant of some £8,000 from the [[Nuffield Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;Third Statistical Account of Scotland." The Scottish Historical Review, vol. 26, no. 101, 1947, pp. 86–89&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947, the Third Statistical Account was initiated, and followed a similar parish format to the earlier accounts. The first volume, covering [[Ayrshire]], was published in 1951. Ultimately it was more rigorous and wide-ranging than either of its predecessors, covering [[industry]], [[transport]], [[culture]] and [[demographics]]. Volume editors ensured a more generic approach than before, but even so the spirit of the originals was retained, even if idiosyncrasies remained.

The scale of the project, ongoing difficulties with funding and finding publishers (which included [[William Collins (publisher)|Collins]] and Oliver &amp; Boyd) meant that the project took over forty years to complete, with a gap of more than a decade following the publication of ''Edinburgh'' in 1966. It was not until 1992 that the last volume, ''The County of [[Roxburgh]]'', was published, under the auspices of the [[Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations]]. Another consequence of this delay was that the later volumes covered administrative divisions which no longer existed.  Several parish accounts had to be revised or rewritten due to the lapse of time between the fieldwork and publication.  One account, the parish of [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]] in West Lothian, was revised twice and all three versions appear in the published volume.  The account for the parish of [[Currie]] went missing by the time the Midlothian volume was put together and the book appears without it.

Although the project was more [[secular]] than before, sections of the accounts continued to focus on religious life, and several of the parish accounts were still written by Church of Scotland ministers.  The tone of the comments in the 'Way of Life' often appear surprisingly judgmental to a modern reader, and there can be ill-concealed exasperation with the behaviour of working-class parishioners. For example, again and again, spending on [[football pools]] is denounced, as are other ways of spending money and leisure time. Judgmentalism turns to plain insult in remarks like 'The people of [[Dura Den]] can be extremely ignorant' (Parish of [[Kemback]], Fife) and 'Singing in the schools and the church is painful to an educated ear' (Parish of [[Inch, Wigtownshire]]).

A '''syrt''' is a kind of an elevated [[landform]] in [[Russia]] and [[Central Asia]].

The word means "[[Highland (geography)|highland]]", "[[ridge]]" or "[[Vertebral column|backbone]]" in [[Turkic languages]] (''sırt'') and is present in Turkic [[toponym]]y in the mentioned areas: in [[Tien Shan]], [[Pamirs]], South [[Urals]], such as [[Obshchiy Syrt]] by [[Urals]], [[Uzun-Syrt]] ("Long [[dorsum (biology)|back]]") plateau by [[Koktebel]] in [[Crimea]].

It is a [[denudation]]al [[Highland (geography)|upland]] or elevated [[flatlands|flatland]], a kind of [[dissected plateau]]. Syrts may be separated from each other by higher ridges. At the same time, syrts may serve as [[water divide]]s between [[drainage basin]]s for larger rivers.

The term should not to be confused with the Latin term ''[[wikt:syrtis|syrtis]]'' and the derived term "syrt" for sandy shores or [[quicksand]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2814">The '''First Law of Geography''', according to [[Waldo Tobler]], is "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."&lt;ref&gt;Tobler W., (1970) "A computer movie simulating urban growth in the Detroit region". ''Economic Geography'', 46(Supplement): 234-240.&lt;/ref&gt; This first law is the foundation of the fundamental concepts of [[spatial dependence]] and [[spatial autocorrelation]] and is utilized specifically for the [[inverse distance weighting]] method for [[spatial interpolation]] and to support the [[regionalized variable theory]] for [[kriging]].&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Karen.  "Encyclopedia of Geographic Information Science", SAGE, 2008, p146-147&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobler first presented his seminal idea during a meeting of the [[International Geographical Union]]'s Commission on Qualitative Methods held in 1969 and later published by him in 1970. Though simple in its presentation, this idea is profound. Without it, "the full range of conditions anywhere on the Earth's surface could in principle be found packed within any small area. There would be no regions of approximately homogeneous conditions to be described by giving attributes to area objects. Topographic surfaces would vary chaotically, with slopes that were everywhere infinite, and the contours of such surfaces would be infinitely dense and contorted. Spatial analysis, and indeed life itself, would be impossible."&lt;ref&gt;De Smith, Michael John; Goodchild, Michael F.; Longley, Paul. "Geospatial Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide to Principles, Techniques and Software Tools", Troubador Publishing Ltd, 2007, p44&lt;/ref&gt;

Less well known is his second law, which complements the first: "The phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside".&lt;ref&gt;Linear pycnophylactic reallocation—Comment on a paper by D. Martin, ''International Journal of Geographical Information Science'', 13(1), 85-90, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and background==
The theory is based upon the concept of the [[friction of distance]] "where distance itself hinders interaction between places. The farther two places are apart, the greater the hindrance",&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Meredith; Alagona, Peter S. "AP Human Geography 2008", Barron's Educational Series, 91-92, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or cost. For example, one is less likely to travel across town to purchase a sandwich than walk to the corner store for the same sandwich. In this example hindrance, or cost, can readily be counted in time and transportation costs which are added to the price of the purchase and thus result in high levels of friction. The friction of distance and the increase in cost combine causing the [[distance decay]] effect.

'''William Soone''' or '''Zoone''' ([[fl.]] 1540–1575) was an English jurist and cartographer.

==Life==
Soone was educated at [[Cambridge University]], where he matriculated at [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]] in 1544. He graduated B.A. 1547, and proceeded M.A. at some date after 1549.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|SN544W|Sone, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[doctor of civil and canon laws]], probably at some university on the continent. The bursars' accounts of [[Caius College]] show that he was resident at [[Gonville Hall]], probably as a fellow, from 1548 to 1555. In 1561 he became [[Regius Professor of Civil Law (Cambridge)|regius professor of civil law]], and in June of that year was admitted fellow of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]].

He would not conform to the [[Church of England]], and, leaving Cambridge, went abroad. His successor in the professorship, [[William Clerke (professor)|William Clerke]], was appointed in 1563. Soone is said to have resided at Paris, Dol, Freiburg, and Padua, and to have been a professor of law for some time at [[Leuven]]. From Leuven he went, most likely, to [[Antwerp]], where he acted as assistant to [[Abraham Ortelius]].

In 1572 he was at [[Cologne]]. He then passed to Rome, and had some papal appointment.

==Works==
In Cologne he published ‘Gulielmi Sooni Vantesdeni Auditor sive Pomponius Mela disputator de Situ Orbis’. Part of this rare book, the ‘Novi incolæ orbis terrarum,’ is copied from that of [[Arnold Mylius]] and published by Ortelius in the 1570 edition of the ‘Theatrum.’ Accordingly Ortelius complained, and Soone offered explanations dated from Cologne, 31 August 1572.

Soone also copied the map of Cambridge which [[Richard Lyne (engraver)|Richard Lyne]] had drawn for [[John Caius]]'s ‘History of the University’ (1574), and published his copy in [[Georg Braun]] and Hogenberg's ‘Civitates Orbis terrarum’ (1575?). With this map went a description of the university.

The '''World Ocean Conference 2009''' ('''WOC''') is an international conference to develop a common understanding and firm commitment to address the adverse impact of [[climate change]] on the state of the world’s [[ocean]]s, and increase understanding on the role of the oceans as ‘climate moderator’. This conference includes diplomats and heads of state from a number of countries.  It took place in May 2009 in [[Manado]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Ocean Conference 2009 Digelar di Manado |url=http://edukasi.kompas.com/read/2008/11/27/17355392/world.ocean.conference.2009.digelar.di.manado |publisher=[[Kompas]]|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its topic is the threat to various nations from rising oceans due to [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Ocean Conference Bulletin|url=http://enb.iisd.org/oceans/woc2009/html/ymbvol162num5e.html |publisher=[[International Institute for Sustainable Development]]|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was scheduled to be held from 11 - 14 May, included hundreds of officials and experts from over 74 countries.&lt;ref name="development_bank_1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asian Development Bank|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as a prelude to talks in December 2009 regarding a successor agreement to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="nations_23"&gt;{{Harvnb|United Nations|2009|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), as the instrument that sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), and the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]], 1972, and its 1996 Protocol.&lt;ref name="nations_23"&gt;{{Harvnb|United Nations|2009|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982|url=http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm |publisher=[[United Nations]]|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognises that oceans and coasts provide valuable resources and services to support human populations, particularly coastal communities that heavily depend on them. Sustainable use of marine living resources will enhance global [[food security]] and reduce poverty for present and future generations. The declaration will be put forward to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN FCCC]] and hopefully adopted at the [[Copenhagen Accord|COP 15]] in [[Copenhagen]] at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="mangroves"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Ocean Conference|url=https://www.mangrovesforthefuture.org/news-and-media/events/indonesia/2009/world-ocean-conference/ |publisher=Mangroves for the Future|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;{{cite news|title=Manado Ocean Declaration Adopted at World Ocean Conference - Ocean States Eye Copenhagen|url=http://www.cep.unep.org/news-and-events/manado-ocean-declaration-adopted-at-world-ocean-conference-ocean-states-eye-copenhagen|publisher=Caribbean Environment Programme|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing the detrimental effects and importance of climate change, The WOC  agreed to discuss the commitments on how to increase the role ocean in reducing the impact of climate change. The WOC have three main interests of states:&lt;ref name="world bank"/&gt;
* SIDS - very concern on [[sea-level rise]] (Indonesia is the largest archipelagical country in the world). Climate change is particularly threatening to Indonesia as sea level rise would adversely affect many Indonesia's low lying coastal areas.&lt;ref name="vaughn_19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughn|2010|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tropical developing states - on adaptation measures, food security, and livelihood
* Developed states - observing the possibility that the ocean could function as "Carbon Sink"

==Objectives==
The main purpose of the WOC 2009 is to adoption of [[Manado Ocean Declaration]] (MOD).&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt; The declaration consists of 14 core opening paragraphs and 21 points of operative agreement. The contents of the declaration include the commitment to long-term conservation, management, and sustainable use of marine living resources, establish national strategies to sustainably manage marine and coastal ecosystems and enhance their resilience, reduce land- and sea-based pollution, and also to increase understanding and information exchange on coasts, oceans and climate change, particularly in developing countries.&lt;ref name="world bank"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deklarasi Kelautan Manado Disepakati 75 Negara|url=http://sains.kompas.com/read/2009/05/14/18203851/Deklarasai.Kelautan.Manado.Disepakati.75.Negara|publisher=[[Kompas]]|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticism the MOD was not strong enough to push the international community to help developing nations deal with the impacts of climate change, Indonesian Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Minister [[Freddy Numberi]], chairman of the conference, said the WOC had put oceans center stage in world attention and raised awareness of the importance of oceans in climate change. But representatives from both developed and developing countries expressed satisfaction with the results.&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FINAL Press Release: Laporan Capaian Panitia Penyelenggara WOC 2009 dan CTI Summit serta Langkah Menuju ke COP-15 UNFCCC Kopenhagen|url=http://beritamanado.com/final-press-release-laporan-capaian-panitia-penyelenggara-woc-2009-dan-cti-summit-serta-langkah-menuju-ke-cop-15-unfccc-kopenhagen/|publisher=PT BMCOM|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
