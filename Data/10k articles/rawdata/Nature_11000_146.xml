'''Aja''' is an [[Orisha]], the spirit of the forest, the animals within it and herbal healers. She is a patron of the forest and all the animals within it. She holds the secrets of botany, and is a master of potions and healing herbs. She passed this skill to the Yoruban people, who practice her craft to this very day.

'''Aloha Wanderwell''' (name '''Idris Galcia Hall''' born 13 October 1906 – 4 June 1996) was a Canadian-American internationalist, explorer, author, filmmaker, and aviatrix, born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, who would later become a United States citizen at a young age. While still a teenager, she joined an expedition to travel around the world by [[Ford Model T|Ford 1918 Model T]], 1930 Model A, and a 1935 Touring Sedan — all Fords — and continuing to use Fords until her passing in 1996.

Aloha began her adventuring career when she met her traveling companion, Walter "Cap" Wanderwell, in 1922. They married in 1925 and had two children. As they continued to travel the world, Aloha performed on stage doing travel lectures while next to her a silent movie, "Car and Camera Around the World", played. The Wanderwells recorded their world journeys on 35mm nitrate and 16mm film, which all reside in the vaults at The Academy Film Archives, Hollywood, California USA. While stranded in Brazil, she lived among the [[Bororo (Brazil)|Bororo people]] and recorded the earliest film documentation of them for 6 weeks. In 1932, her husband was shot and killed on his yacht ''Carma'' in Long Beach, California. Aloha later married Walter Baker and continued her travels, ultimately visiting over 80 countries and six continents, and driving over 500,000 miles all in Fords.

"First Female to Drive Around the World" 1922-1927 Guinness World Records.

The first female to drive around the world was achieved by Aloha Wanderwell (USA/Canada) who traveled the world in a Ford Model T, starting and ending in Nice, France, between 29 December 1922 and January 1927.
Aloha traveled as driver, translator and film maker for the Wanderwell Expeditions, a round-the-world motoring tour led by Walter "Cap" Wanderwell (Poland).

==Early life==
Idris Galcia Welsh was born on 13 October 1906 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] to Margaret Headley and Robert Welsh. In 1909, her mother married Herbert Hall, and her name was changed to Idris Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Obee|first1=Dave|title=Fearless young adventurer had roots on the Island|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/entertainment/books/fearless-young-adventurer-had-roots-on-the-island-1.2943569|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=Times Colonist|date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her step-father was a developer and rancher on [[Vancouver Island]] and the family lived in [[Parksville, British Columbia|Parksville]] and [[Duncan, British Columbia|Duncan]].&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt; In 1914, at the start of the [[First World War]], her step-father joined the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] and after arriving in England was transferred to the British Army and made a lieutenant in the [[Durham Light Infantry]]. The family (Idris, her sister Margret "Miki" Hall, and their mother) followed him to Europe, where they traveled around England, Belgium, and France. In June 1917, Herbert Hall was killed in combat in [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

Hoping to tame Idris's tomboyish tendencies, her mother sent her to boarding schools, first to Benedictine Soeurs du Saint-Sacrement in Courtrai, Belgium, later to Chateau Neuf in [[Nice]].&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;

==The Wanderwell Expedition==
In 1921, Walter Wanderwell was capturing headlines with the Million Dollar Wager, a round-the-world [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]] between two teams racing Ford Model Ts to see which team could visit the most countries. A controversial figure, Wanderwell (born Valerian Johannes Pieczynski) had been jailed in the United States during [[World War I]] on suspicion of being a German spy, but was released in 1918. Wanderwell was inspired by his meeting with the League of Nations and around 1930 he formed his own organization Work Around the World Educational Club or (WAWEC).&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

In 1922, when she was 16, Idris met Walter Wanderwell for the first time, after responding to one of his advertisements declaring ''"Brains, Beauty &amp; Breeches – World Tour Offer For Lucky Young Woman…. Wanted to join an expedition… Asia, Africa…"'' She met with "Captain" Wanderwell in Paris and secured a seat on the expedition. She served as the expedition's translator, driver and secretary, and took on the name "Aloha Wanderwell," even though Walter was still married to Nell at the time, but divorced after Aloha joined the expedition.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

Partially sponsored by the Ford Motor Company, the round-the-world tour also sustained itself through filming and travel lectures, from Africa through the Middle East and on to Asia. In Calcutta in 1924, their tour crossed paths with planes from the [[first aerial circumnavigation]], and Aloha filmed their meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell|first=Joseph N.|title=The Newport Connection to 'Great Air Race'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-30/news/li-379_1_great-air-race|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 30, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They came to the United States in January 1925. Aloha would become an American citizen and marry Wanderwell on April 7, 1925 in Riverside, California. Their marriage foiled a plan by FBI agents to arrest Pieczynski under the [[Mann Act]], a law that prohibits transporting women across state lines for "immoral purposes."&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes|year=2009|publisher=[[Facts on File]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4381-1914-4|pages=385–387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gijG7fSwvjAC&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;ots=KO2HEWeMDB&amp;dq=%22Aloha%20Wanderwell%22&amp;pg=PA386#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2nd|chapter=Wanderwell, Walter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Allan E|title=Aloha Wanderwell, Walter Piecynski, assorted hanky-panky and the Mann Act|url=http://www.freewebs.com/armchairadventurers/alohawanderwelletal.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130123135405/http://www.freewebs.com/armchairadventurers/alohawanderwelletal.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 January 2013|publisher=Armchair Adventurers|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aloha gave birth to a daughter, Valri, in December, 1925 and son Nile in April, 1927. The Wanderwells continued their travels, sailing to Cuba and South Africa. Aside from dealing with poor roads, the Wanderwells also had difficulty finding gasoline for their vehicles. During their travels through Africa from 1926–1928, they used crushed bananas for grease and elephant fat for engine oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Globe-Circling Car to be Gift to Ford: Aloha Wanderwell to Present Dearborn Museum Auto She and Husband Used|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 30, 1929 |quote=On this trip they used kerosene for gasoline, crushed bananas for grease in the differential and water and elephant fat for oil in the engine, she said. In India on their round-the-world trip oxen were required frequently to tow the Ford across mud flats and rivers, and in China in 1924, when civil warfare made it impossible to purchase fuel, coolies towed the car for eighty miles...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global tour included 43 countries. Author [[Benjamin Allen (cartoonist)|Stookie Allen]] contends that during this time, Hall cut her hair and fought as a member of the [[French Foreign Legion]].&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;

The Wanderwells returned to the United States where they made a home in Miami in 1929 and donated one of their Model Ts, known as ''Little Lizzie'', to [[Henry Ford]] before the screening of the film, ''Car and Camera Around the World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Around-the-World Movie: Miss Wanderwell's Exploits With Camera Shown at Fifth Avenue.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/12/17/archives/aroundtheworld-movie-miss-wanderwells-exploits-with-camera-shown-at.html |newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 17, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, Henry Ford decided that ''Little Lizzie'' and 50 other autos would be scrapped for the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Treace|first=Dan|title=The Wanderwell Expedition: Model T Fords circle the globe 1919–1925|url=http://www.tmodelman.com/wanderwell.php|publisher=Tmodelman.com|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==
In 1930 and 1931, Aloha learned to fly a German seaplane, "Junker" that she would later land on an uncharted part of the Amazon River when the Wanderwells traveled to the state of [[Mato Grosso]] in [[Brazil]]. They set up camp at the Descalvados Ranch in [[Cuiabá]] and were ostensibly searching for lost explorer [[Colonel Percival Harrison Fawcett]], who was looking for the legendary [[Lost City of Z]] (some speculate this to either be synonymous or different to the legendary city of Eldorado). They made several flights with a seaplane, once running out of fuel on the [[Paraguay River]] and receiving help from the [[Bororo (Brazil)|Bororo people]]. The crew's cameraman filmed a ceremonial dance, a [[first contact (anthropology)|first contact]] scenario with Boboré villagers, and Bororo men experiencing [[Couvade syndrome|sympathetic labor pains]]. The 32-minute silent film called ''Last of the Bororos'' is preserved in the Smithsonian Institution's Human Studies Film Archives and includes Aloha's meeting with Brazilian explorer [[Cândido Rondon]].&lt;ref name="Levine"&gt;{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Allan E|title=Aloha Wanderwell|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/aloha-wanderwell|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last of the Bororos 1930–1931|url=http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!218206!0|work=Human Studies Film Archives|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staples|first=Amy J.|title=Safari Adventure: Forgotten Cinematic Journeys in Africa|journal=Film History: An International Journal|year=2006|volume=18|issue=4|pages=392–411|doi=10.1353/fih.2007.0007|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/film_history/v018/18.4staples.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Walter Wanderwell==
In late 1932, the couple purchased a yacht, the 110-foot ''Carma'', intending to document their voyage to the South Seas on film. On December 5, 1932, the day before they were to embark, Walter Wanderwell was murdered on the yacht in the harbor near Long Beach, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guy Arraigned in Yacht Murder; Hearing Dec. 19|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2tFbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tVINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4714,2988525&amp;dq=aloha-wanderwell&amp;hl=en|newspaper=St. Joseph Gazette|date=December 15, 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; William James Guy, a member of their 1931 expedition to South America who had attempted to mutiny on a previous voyage, was tried for the crime. Guy had an alibi and was acquitted by the jury and Judge Kenny.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wanderwell Note Lost Since Death: Widow, at Trial, Says Missing Paper Involved Guy, the Man Accused of Murder|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 4, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another man, Edward Eugene Fernando Montague, was briefly considered a suspect, but was never charged.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

==Remarriage==
Aloha later married Walter Baker in Louisiana&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; The couple traveled to New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii, India, Cambodia, Wyoming USA &amp; [[Indochina]], with Aloha later recounting being surrounded by five herds of elephants and having to shoot their way out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Traveler Received Greatest Thrill in View of Rulers at Close Range|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UI0vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6tsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5534,5889882&amp;dq=aloha-baker&amp;hl=en|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=June 22, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her final films include ''To See the World by Car'' (1935–37), ''India Now'', and ''Explorers of the Purple Sage, in Technicolor'', which contains the only known footage of Desert Dust, the famous palomino wild horse. All films were made with Walter Baker.

She continued to give lectures and wrote an autobiographical account of her travels, ''Call to Adventure!'', published in 1939, and later republished in 2012. The couple eventually settled in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] where Wanderwell worked in radio broadcasting, WlW Radio 1939, and print journalism. In 1947, she and Walter Baker moved to Lido Isle community in [[Newport Beach, California]]. Aloha gave her final performance in front of 150 family members and guests, with Dr. Pete Lee, curator at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles in 1982. She died on June 4, 1996.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

==Archives==
Footage by Aloha Wanderwell, is held at the Academy Film Archive and AMPAS. in the Aloha Wanderwell Baker Film Collection. The Academy Film Archive has preserved approx. 66 cans,1000' each of film 35mm Nitrate and 16mm, including rare 1920s and 1930s footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aloha Wanderwell Film Collection|url=http://www.oscars.org/film-archive/collections/aloha-wanderwell-film-collection|website=Academy Film Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arctic coastal tundra''' is an [[ecoregion]] of the far north of North America, an important breeding ground for a great deal of wildlife.

==Setting==
This ecoregion is located on the north coast of [[Alaska]], and includes the east coast plain of [[Banks Island]], as well as the [[Anderson River (Northwest Territories)|Anderson River]] and [[Horton River (Canada)|Horton River]] plains, and the [[Tuktoyaktuk]] coast in the [[Northwest Territories]]. This is an area of low, flat, boggy coastal plains. The underlying soil of this damp Arctic coast is thick, solid permafrost, covered in summer with [[thermokarst]] "thaw lakes" of melted ice. Ice features such as [[ice wedge]]s and [[pingo]] mounds of soil and ice can be found. This coast has an arctic climate warm enough to allow plant growth in late-June, July and August only, and even then frosts may occur. On the whole this is a damper, wetter area than the [[Low Arctic tundra]] ecoregion that continues along the coast west of here to [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na1103|name=Arctic coastal tundra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
This area supports wetland plants especially [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and grasses, [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s, and right on the coast there are peat bogs. Trees such as [[dwarf birch]], [[willow]]s, northern Labrador tea ([[Dryas (plant)|Dryas]]) and [[alder]]s grow in the warmer areas of the region, the [[Mackenzie River]] delta and the [[Yukon]] coast.

==Fauna==
This region provides calving habitat for four herds of [[caribou]], the Western Arctic, Teshekpuk, Central Arctic, and [[Porcupine caribou]] herds. Another key species is the [[muskox]] of [[Banks Island]] and the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] coast. Other mammals include [[lemming]]s, [[polar bear]], [[walrus]], [[beluga whale]], [[snowshoe hare]] and [[Arctic hare]], [[red fox]], [[grey wolf]], [[Arctic ground squirrel]] and [[Pinniped|seal]]s. The coast is also home to many breeding waterbirds including [[snow goose]], [[spectacled eider]], [[Steller's eider]], [[king eider]], and [[yellow-billed loon]]. Important bird areas include the [[Colville River (Alaska)|Colville River]] delta, [[Teshekpuk Lake]] (which is within the [[National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska]]), and [[Kasegaluk Lagoon]] a breeding area for [[brant goose]]. Predatory birds include the [[snowy owl]]s that hunt waterbirds and lemmings. Fish of the waters here include the [[Arctic char]].

==Threats and preservation==
90% of natural habitat remains intact, except for the vicinity of [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]] and the oil fields of [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska]] and [[Kuparuk River Oil Field|Kuparuk]] which are expanding along the coast and may in future spread into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is the only major protected area on this coast (see [[Arctic Refuge drilling controversy]]), and on and around the [[Dalton Highway]] and the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]].

'''Bioclaustration''' is kind of interaction when one [[organism]] (usually soft bodied) is embedded in a living substrate (i.e. skeleton of another organism); it means “biologically walled -up”.  In case of [[symbiosis]] the walling-up is not complete and both organisms stay alive (Palmer and Wilson, 1988).

[[File:StairsOfReduction.svg|thumb|The place of the Boltzmann kinetic equation on the stairs of model reduction from microscopic dynamics to macroscopic continuum dynamics (illustration to the content of the book&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Gorban, I. V. Karlin, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27246969_Invariant_manifolds_for_physical_and_chemical_kinetics Invariant manifolds for physical and chemical kinetics], Lecture Notes in Physics, January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;)]]

The '''Boltzmann equation''' or '''Boltzmann transport equation''' ('''BTE''') describes the statistical behaviour of a [[thermodynamic system]] not in a state of [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], devised by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in 1872.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaediaof"&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R. G. Lerner, G. L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
The classic example of such a system is a [[fluid]] with [[temperature gradient]]s in space causing heat to flow from hotter regions to colder ones, by the random but biased transport of the [[particle]]s making up that fluid. In the modern literature the term Boltzmann equation is often used in a more general sense, referring to any kinetic equation that describes the change of a macroscopic quantity in a thermodynamic system, such as energy, charge or particle number.

The equation arises not by analyzing the individual [[position vector|position]]s and [[momentum|momenta]] of each particle in the fluid but rather by considering a probability distribution for the position and momentum of a typical particle—that is, the [[probability]] that the particle occupies a given [[infinitesimal|very small]] region of space (mathematically written &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}^3 \bf{r}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}&lt;/math&gt; means "[[differential of a function|differential]]") centered at the position &lt;math&gt;\bf{r}&lt;/math&gt;, and has momentum nearly equal to a given momentum vector &lt;math&gt; \bf{p}&lt;/math&gt; (thus occupying a very small region of [[momentum space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}^3 \bf{p}&lt;/math&gt;), at an instant of time.

The Boltzmann equation can be used to determine how physical quantities change, such as [[heat]] energy and [[momentum]], when a fluid is in transport. One may also derive other properties characteristic to fluids such as [[viscosity]], [[thermal conductivity]], and [[electrical conductivity]] (by treating the charge carriers in a material as a gas).&lt;ref name="Encyclopaediaof" /&gt; See also [[convection-diffusion equation]].

The equation is a [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] [[integro-differential equation]], and the unknown function in the equation is a probability density function in six-dimensional space of a particle position and momentum. The problem of existence and uniqueness of solutions is still not fully resolved, but some recent results are quite promising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=DiPerna | first1= R.

==Overview==

===The phase space and density function===
The set of all possible positions '''r''' and momenta '''p''' is called the [[phase space]] of the system; in other words a set of three [[coordinates]] for each position coordinate ''x, y, z'', and three more for each momentum component ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''. The entire space is 6-[[dimension]]al: a point in this space is ('''r''', '''p''') = (''x, y, z, p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''), and each coordinate is [[Parametric equation|parameterized]] by time ''t''. The small volume ("differential [[volume element]]") is written 
:&lt;math&gt; \text{d}^3\mathbf{r}\,\text{d}^3\mathbf{p} = \text{d}x\,\text{d}y\,\text{d}z\,\text{d}p_x\,\text{d}p_y\,\text{d}p_z. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the probability of ''N'' molecules which ''all'' have '''r''' and '''p''' within &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}^3\bf{r}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}^3\bf{p}&lt;/math&gt; is in question, at the heart of the equation is a quantity ''f'' which gives this probability per unit phase-space volume, or probability per unit length cubed per unit momentum cubed, at an instant of time ''t''. This is a [[probability density function]]: ''f''('''r''', '''p''', ''t''), defined so that,

:&lt;math&gt;\text{d}N = f (\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p},t)\,\text{d}^3\mathbf{r}\,\text{d}^3\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

is the number of molecules which ''all'' have positions lying within a volume element &lt;math&gt; d^3\bf{r}&lt;/math&gt; about '''r''' and momenta lying within a [[momentum space]] element &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}^3\bf{p}&lt;/math&gt; about '''p''', at time ''t''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Huang |first=Kerson |year=1987 |title=Statistical Mechanics |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-81518-1 |page=53 |edition=Second }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Integration (calculus)|Integrating]] over a region of position space and momentum space gives the total number of particles which have positions and momenta in that region:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
N &amp; = \int\limits_\mathrm{momenta} \text{d}^3\mathbf{p} \int\limits_\mathrm{positions} \text{d}^3\mathbf{r}\,f (\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p},t) \\[5pt]
&amp; = \iiint\limits_\mathrm{momenta} \quad \iiint\limits_\mathrm{positions}  f(x,y,z,p_x,p_y,p_z,t) \, \text{d}x \, \text{d}y \, \text{d}z \, \text{d}p_x \, \text{d}p_y \, \text{d}p_z
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is a [[multiple integral|6-fold integral]]. While ''f'' is associated with a number of particles, the phase space is for one-particle (not all of them, which is usually the case with [[deterministic]] [[many body problem|many-body]] systems), since only one '''r''' and '''p''' is in question. It is not part of the analysis to use '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for particle 1, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for particle 2, etc. up to '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; for particle ''N''.

It is assumed the particles in the system are identical (so each has an identical [[mass]] ''m''). For a mixture of more than one [[chemical species]], one distribution is needed for each, see below.

===Principal statement===

The general equation can then be written as&lt;ref name="McGrawHill"&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C. B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{df}{dt} =
 \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\text{force} +
 \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\text{diff} +
 \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\text{coll},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the "force" term corresponds to the forces exerted on the particles by an external influence (not by the particles themselves), the "diff" term represents the [[diffusion]] of particles, and "coll" is the [[collision]] term – accounting for the forces acting between particles in collisions. Expressions for each term on the right side are provided below.&lt;ref name="McGrawHill" /&gt;

Note that some authors use the particle velocity '''v''' instead of momentum '''p'''; they are related in the definition of momentum by '''p''' = ''m'''''v'''.

==The force and diffusion terms==

Consider particles described by ''f'', each experiencing an ''external'' force '''F''' not due to other particles (see the collision term for the latter treatment).

Suppose at time ''t'' some number of particles all have position '''r''' within element &lt;math&gt; d^3\bf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and momentum '''p''' within &lt;math&gt; d^3\bf{p}&lt;/math&gt;. If a force '''F''' instantly acts on each particle, then at time ''t'' + Δ''t'' their position will be '''r''' + Δ'''r''' = '''r''' + '''p'''Δ''t''/''m''  and momentum '''p''' + Δ'''p''' = '''p''' + '''F'''Δ''t''. Then, in the absence of collisions, ''f'' must satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;
f \left (\mathbf{r}+\frac{\mathbf{p}}{m} \, \Delta t,\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{F} \, \Delta t, t+\Delta t \right )\,d^3\mathbf{r}\,d^3\mathbf{p} = f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{p},t) \, d^3\mathbf{r} \, d^3\mathbf{p}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that we have used the fact that the phase space volume element &lt;math&gt; d^3\bf{r}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; d^3\bf{p}&lt;/math&gt; is constant, which can be shown using [[Hamilton's equations]] (see the discussion under [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]]). However, since collisions do occur, the particle density in the phase-space volume &lt;math&gt; d^3\bf{r}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;math&gt; d^3\bf{p}&lt;/math&gt; changes, so

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
dN_\mathrm{coll} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \right)_\mathrm{coll}\Delta td^3\mathbf{r} d^3\mathbf{p} \\[5pt]
&amp; = f \left (\mathbf{r}+\frac{\mathbf{p}}{m}\Delta t,\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{F}\Delta t, t+\Delta t \right)d^3\mathbf{r}d^3\mathbf{p} - f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{p}, t) \, d^3\mathbf{r} \, d^3\mathbf{p} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \Delta f \, d^3\mathbf{r} \, d^3\mathbf{p} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where Δ''f'' is the ''total'' change in ''f''. Dividing ({{EquationNote|1}}) by &lt;math&gt; d^3\bf{r}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; d^3\bf{p}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;Δ''t'' and taking the limits Δ''t'' → 0 and Δ''f'' → 0, we have

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d f}{d t} = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \right)_\mathrm{coll}&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The total [[differential of a function|differential]] of ''f'' is:

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d f &amp; = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \, dt 
+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \, dx
+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \, dy
+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \, dz
\right)
+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_x} \, dp_x
+\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_y} \, dp_y
+\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_z} \, dp_z
\right)\\[5pt]
&amp; = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}dt +\nabla f \cdot d\mathbf{r} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{p}}\cdot d\mathbf{p} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}dt +\nabla f \cdot \frac{\mathbf{p}}{m}dt + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{p}}\cdot \mathbf{F} \, dt
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

where ∇ is the [[gradient]] operator, '''·''' is the [[dot product]],

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{p}} = \mathbf{\hat{e}}_x\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_x} + \mathbf{\hat{e}}_y\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_y} + \mathbf{\hat{e}}_z \frac{\partial f}{\partial p_z}= \nabla_\mathbf{p}f
&lt;/math&gt;

is a shorthand for the momentum analogue of ∇, and '''ê'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''ê'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''ê'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] [[unit vector]]s.

===Final statement===

Dividing ({{EquationNote|3}}) by ''dt'' and substituting into ({{EquationNote|2}}) gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac{\mathbf{p}}{m}\cdot\nabla f + \mathbf{F} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{p}} = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \right)_\mathrm{coll}&lt;/math&gt;

In this context, '''F'''('''r''', ''t'') is the [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]] acting on the particles in the fluid, and ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the particles. The term on the right hand side is added to describe the effect of collisions between particles; if it is zero then the particles do not collide. The collisionless Boltzmann equation is often called the [[Vlasov equation]].

This equation is more useful than the principal one above, yet still incomplete, since ''f'' cannot be solved unless the collision term in ''f'' is known. This term cannot be found as easily or generally as the others – it is a statistical term representing the particle collisions, and requires knowledge of the statistics the particles obey, like the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell–Boltzmann]], [[Fermi–Dirac distribution|Fermi–Dirac]] or [[Bose–Einstein distribution|Bose–Einstein]] distributions.

==The collision term (Stosszahlansatz) and molecular chaos==

A key insight applied by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] was to determine the collision term resulting solely from two-body collisions between particles that are assumed to be uncorrelated prior to the collision. This assumption was referred to by Boltzmann as the "{{lang|de|Stosszahlansatz}}" and is also known as the "[[molecular chaos]] assumption". Under this assumption the collision term can be written as a momentum-space integral over the product of one-particle distribution functions:&lt;ref name="Encyclopaediaof" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
 \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\text{coll} =
 \iint gI(g, \Omega)[f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p'}_A, t) f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p'}_B,t) - f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p}_A,t) f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p}_B,t)] \,d\Omega \,d^3\mathbf{p}_A \,d^3\mathbf{p}_B,
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; are the momenta of any two particles (labeled as ''A'' and ''B'' for convenience) before a collision, '''p&amp;prime;'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p&amp;prime;'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; are the momenta after the collision,
:&lt;math&gt;
 g = |\mathbf{p}_B - \mathbf{p}_A| = |\mathbf{p'}_B - \mathbf{p'}_A|
&lt;/math&gt;
is the magnitude of the relative momenta (see [[relative velocity]] for more on this concept), and ''I''(''g'', Ω) is the [[differential cross section]] of the collision, in which the relative momenta of the colliding particles turns through an angle θ into the element of the [[solid angle]] ''d''Ω, due to the collision.

== Simplifications to the collision term ==
Since much of the challenge in solving the Boltzmann equation originates with the complex collision term, attempts have been made to "model" and simplify the collision term.  The best known model equation is due to Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Model for Collision Processes in Gases. I. Small Amplitude Processes in Charged and Neutral One-Component Systems|journal = Physical Review|date = 1954-05-01|pages = 511–525|volume = 94|issue = 3|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.94.511|first = P. L.|last = Bhatnagar|first2 = E. P.|last2 = Gross|first3 = M.|last3 = Krook|bibcode = 1954PhRv...94..511B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The assumption in the BGK approximation is that the effect of molecular collisions is to force a non-equilibrium distribution function at a point in physical space back to a Maxwellian equilibrium distribution function and that the rate at which this occurs is proportional to the molecular collision frequency.  The Boltzmann equation is therefore modified to the BGK form:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac{\mathbf{p}}{m}\cdot\nabla f + \mathbf{F} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{p}} = \nu (f_0 - f),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular collision frequency, and &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; is the local Maxwellian distribution function given the gas temperature at this point in space.

==General equation (for a mixture)==

For a mixture of chemical species labelled by indices ''i'' = 1, 2, 3, ..., ''n'' the equation for species ''i'' is&lt;ref name="Encyclopaediaof" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial t} + \frac{\mathbf{p}_i}{m_i} \cdot \nabla f_i + \mathbf{F} \cdot \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial \mathbf{p}_i} = \left(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial t} \right)_\text{coll},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''('''r''', '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''), and the collision term is

:&lt;math&gt;
 \left(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial t} \right)_{\mathrm{coll}} = \sum_{j=1}^n \iint g_{ij} I_{ij}(g_{ij}, \Omega)[f'_i f'_j - f_if_j] \,d\Omega\,d^3\mathbf{p'},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f&amp;prime;'' = ''f&amp;prime;''('''p&amp;prime;'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''), the magnitude of the relative momenta is

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = |\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j| = |\mathbf{p'}_i - \mathbf{p'}_j|,&lt;/math&gt;

and ''I&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the differential cross-section, as before, between particles ''i'' and ''j''. The integration is over the momentum components in the integrand (which are labelled ''i'' and ''j''). The sum of integrals describes the entry and exit of particles of species ''i'' in or out of the phase-space element. 

==Applications and extensions==

===Conservation equations===

The Boltzmann equation can be used to derive the fluid dynamic conservation laws for mass, charge, momentum and energy.&lt;ref name="dG1984"&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Groot |first1=S. R.|last2=Mazur|first2=P.|title=Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics |year=1984 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-486-64741-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 163}} For a fluid consisting of only one kind of particle, the number density ''n'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;n = \int f \,d^3p.&lt;/math&gt;

The average value of any function ''A'' is
: &lt;math&gt;\langle A \rangle = \frac 1 n \int A f \,d^3p.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the conservation equations involve tensors, the Einstein summation convention will be used where repeated indices in a product indicate summation over those indices. Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \mapsto x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \mapsto p_i = m w_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is the particle velocity vector. Define &lt;math&gt;A(p_i)&lt;/math&gt; as some function of momentum &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; only, which is conserved in a collision. Assume also that the force &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is a function of position only, and that ''f'' is zero for &lt;math&gt;p_i \to \pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Multiplying the Boltzmann equation by ''A'' and integrating over momentum yields four terms, which, using integration by parts, can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\int A \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \,d^3p = \frac{\partial }{\partial t} (n \langle A \rangle),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{p_j A}{m}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j} \,d^3p = \frac{1}{m}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(n\langle A p_j \rangle),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int A F_j \frac{\partial f}{\partial p_j} \,d^3p = -nF_j\left\langle \frac{\partial A}{\partial p_j}\right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int A \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\text{coll} \,d^3p = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the last term is zero, since ''A'' is conserved in a collision. Letting &lt;math&gt;A = m&lt;/math&gt;, the mass of the particle, the integrated Boltzmann equation becomes the conservation of mass equation:&lt;ref name="dG1984" /&gt;{{rp|pp 12,168}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rho + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(\rho V_j) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho = mn&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density, and &lt;math&gt;V_i = \langle w_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the average fluid velocity.

Letting &lt;math&gt;A = p_i&lt;/math&gt;, the momentum of the particle, the integrated Boltzmann equation becomes the conservation of momentum equation:&lt;ref name="dG1984" /&gt;{{rp|pp 15,169}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho V_i) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(\rho V_i V_j+P_{ij}) - nF_i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;P_{ij} = \rho \langle (w_i-V_i) (w_j-V_j) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure tensor (the [[viscous stress tensor]] plus the hydrostatic [[pressure]]).

Letting &lt;math&gt;A =\frac{p_i p_i}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;, the kinetic energy of the particle, the integrated Boltzmann equation becomes the conservation of energy equation:&lt;ref name="dG1984" /&gt;{{rp|pp 19,169}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(u + \tfrac{1}{2}\rho V_i V_i) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} (uV_j + \tfrac{1}{2}\rho V_i V_i V_j + J_{qj} + P_{ij}V_i) - nF_iV_i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u = \tfrac{1}{2} \rho \langle (w_i-V_i) (w_i-V_i) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the kinetic thermal energy density, and &lt;math&gt;J_{qi} = \tfrac{1}{2} \rho \langle(w_i - V_i)(w_k - V_k)(w_k - V_k)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux vector.

===Hamiltonian mechanics===

In [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], the Boltzmann equation is often written more generally as
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{L}}[f]=\mathbf{C}[f], \, &lt;/math&gt;
where '''L''' is the [[Liouville operator]] (there is an inconsistent definition between the Liouville operator as defined here and the one in the article linked) describing the evolution of a phase space volume and '''C''' is the collision operator. The non-relativistic form of '''L''' is

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{L}}_\mathrm{NR} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \frac{\mathbf{p}}{m} \cdot \nabla + \mathbf{F}\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{p}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Quantum theory and violation of particle number ===

It is possible to write down relativistic [[quantum Boltzmann equation]]s for [[Quantum field theory|relativistic]] quantum systems in which the number of particles is not conserved in collisions. This has several applications in [[physical cosmology]],&lt;ref name=KolbTurner&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Kolb  |author2=Michael Turner |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Early Universe|year=1990|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780201626742}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the formation of the light elements in [[big bang nucleosynthesis]], the production of [[dark matter]] and [[baryogenesis]]. It is not a priori clear that the state of a quantum system can be characterized by a classical phase space density ''f''. However, for a wide class of applications a well-defined generalization of ''f'' exists which is the solution of an effective Boltzmann equation that can be derived from first principles of [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref name=BEfromQFT&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Drewes |author2=C. Weniger |author3=S. Mendizabal |journal=Phys. Lett. B|date=8 January 2013|volume=718|issue=3|pages=1119–1124|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2012.11.046|arxiv = 1202.1301 |bibcode = 2013PhLB..718.1119D |title=The Boltzmann equation from quantum field theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General relativity and astronomy===

The Boltzmann equation is of use in galactic dynamics. A galaxy, under certain assumptions, may be approximated as a continuous fluid; its mass distribution is then represented by ''f''; in galaxies, physical collisions between the stars are very rare, and the effect of ''gravitational collisions'' can be neglected for times far longer than the [[age of the universe]].

Its generalization in [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehlers J (1971) General Relativity and Cosmology (Varenna), R K Sachs (Academic Press NY);Thorne K S (1980) Rev. Mod. Phys., 52, 299; 
Ellis G F R, Treciokas R, Matravers D R, (1983) Ann. Phys., 150, 487}&lt;/ref&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{L}}_\mathrm{GR}=p^\alpha\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\alpha} - \Gamma^\alpha{}_{\beta\gamma}p^\beta p^\gamma\frac{\partial}{\partial p^\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;

where Γ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Christoffel symbol]] of the second kind (this assumes there are no external forces, so that particles move along geodesics in the absence of collisions), with the important subtlety that the density is a function in mixed contravariant-covariant (''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') phase space as opposed to fully contravariant (''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;, p&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'') phase space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In [[physical cosmology]] the fully covariant approach has been used to study the cosmic microwave background radiation&lt;ref&gt;Maartens R, Gebbie T, Ellis GFR (1999). "Cosmic microwave background anisotropies: Nonlinear dynamics". Phys. Rev. D. 59 (8): 083506&lt;/ref&gt;. More generically the study of processes in the [[early universe]] often attempt to take into account the effects of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name=KolbTurner /&gt; In the very dense medium formed by the primordial plasma after the [[big bang]], particles are continuously created and annihilated. In such an environment [[quantum coherence]] and the spatial extension of the [[wavefunction]] can affect the dynamics, making it questionable whether the classical phase space distribution ''f'' that appears in the Boltzmann equation is suitable to describe the system. In many cases it is, however, possible to derive an effective Boltzmann equation for a generalized distribution function from first principles of [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref name=BEfromQFT /&gt; This includes the formation of the light elements in [[big bang nucleosynthesis]], the production of [[dark matter]] and [[baryogenesis]].

== Solving the Boltzmann equation ==
Exact solutions to the Boltzmann equations have been proven to exist in some cases;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-2011-00697-8 |arxiv=1011.5441 |title=Global Classical Solutions of the Boltzmann Equation without Angular Cut-off |authors=Philip T.

Close to [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics#Local thermodynamic equilibrium|local equilibrium]], solution of the Boltzmann equation can be represented by an [[asymptotic expansion]] in powers of Knudsen number (the [[Chapman–Enskog theory|Chapman-Enskog]] expansion&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Chapman; Thomas George Cowling [https://books.google.com/books?id=JcjHpiJPKeIC&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The mathematical theory of non-uniform gases: an account of the kinetic theory of viscosity, thermal conduction, and diffusion in gases], Cambridge University Press, 1970. {{ISBN|0-521-40844-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The first two terms of this expansion give the [[Euler equations#Euler's_partial_differential_equations|Euler equations]] and the [[Navier-Stokes equations]]. The higher terms have singularities. The problem of developing mathematically the limiting processes, which lead from the atomistic view (represented by Boltzmann's equation) to the laws of motion of continua, is an important part of [[Hilbert's sixth problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Theme issue [http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/376/2118 ‘Hilbert's sixth problem’], Phil.

'''Canoe Creek State Park''' is a {{convert|911.91|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Frankstown Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania|Frankstown Township]] in [[Blair County, Pennsylvania|Blair County]], [[Pennsylvania]].  It is 12 miles east of [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]], the nearest [[city]]. [[Canoe Lake (Pennsylvania)|Canoe Lake]], at {{convert|155|acre}}, is the focus of recreation at the park and is open for fishing year-round. Canoe Creek State Park is a half mile off [[U.S. Route 22]] near the small town of [[Canoe Creek, Pennsylvania|Canoe Creek]]. The park was opened to the public in 1979 and was developed as part of an expansion effort in the 1970s to improve the state park system in Pennsylvania.

Canoe Creek State Park was chosen by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of "Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks".&lt;ref name ="must see"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/index.htm | title = Find a Park: Twenty Must-see Parks | accessdate = November 26, 2011 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}} ''Note: Despite the title, there are twenty-one parks in the list, with [[Colton Point State Park|Colton Point]] and [[Leonard Harrison State Park]]s treated as one.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial history==
The area in and surrounding Canoe Creek State Park is rich in [[limestone]]. The limestone was [[quarry|quarried]] and used for many purposes like providing needed raw materials for the [[iron]] and [[steel]] industries of Pennsylvania. There are several abandoned quarries on the park lands. Two [[limekiln]]s also operated within the boundaries of the park during the 1900s.  The remnants of a kiln once owned by the [[Blair Limestone Company]] stand today as a reminder of the industrial past. The Blair Limestone Company kiln is a stop on the [[Path of Progress]] tour, a driving tour of Pennsylvania's industrial heritage stretching for {{convert|500|mi}}.&lt;ref name="canoecreeksp"&gt;{{cite web

==Wildlife==
The Frank Felbaum Bat Sanctuary is the home of the largest nursery colony of [[little brown bat]]s in Pennsylvania. This one-time church, now known as the Canoe Creek Bat Refuge, attracts visitors interested in observing the bats as they emerge each night for feeding. The park is also the site of a [[Hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernaculum]] for more than 30,000 bats of six species, including the endangered [[Indiana bat]].&lt;ref name="canoecreeksp"/&gt;

Canoe Creek State park is on the path followed by many species of migratory birds including [[waterfowl]], [[bald eagle]]s and [[osprey]]s. The wetlands provide habitat for birds like the [[bluebird]], [[New World oriole|oriole]], [[red-winged blackbird]] and the [[brown thrasher]].&lt;ref name="canoecreeksp"/&gt;

The park also provided a habitat for the woodland creatures most common in Pennsylvania, [[white-tailed deer]], [[Wild turkey|turkey]], [[Eastern gray squirrel|squirrels]], [[chipmunk]]s, and [[ruffed grouse]]. The [[hunting]] of these animals is permitted during the hunting seasons designated by the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]].&lt;ref name="canoecreeksp"/&gt;

==Recreation==
Canoe Lake is [[fish stocking|stocked]] with game fish by the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]]. Fisherman can catch [[bass (fish)|bass]], [[trout]], [[walleye]], [[muskellunge]], [[American pickerel|pickerel]] and [[catfish]] during the summer and winter months at Canoe Lake. [[Ice fishing]] is permitted, but the thickness of the ice is not monitored.&lt;ref name="canoecreeksp"/&gt;

The sand beach at Canoe Lake is opened starting [[Memorial Day]] weekend and ending [[Labor Day]] weekend.&lt;ref name="canoecreeksp"/&gt;  Beginning in 2008 lifeguards will not be posted at the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesleader.com/news/ap?articleID=384046 |title=Pa. state parks going without life guards at beaches in 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2008 |publisher=[[Times Leader]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007235840/http://www.timesleader.com/news/ap?articleID=384046 |archivedate=October 7, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only motorized boats permitted on Canoe Lake are electrically powered. They must be properly registered with any state. Non-powered boats such as [[rowboat]]s, [[canoes]] and [[kayaks]] must also display registration stickers from any state.&lt;ref name="canoecreeksp"/&gt;

There are eight miles of trails that are open year-round to [[hiking]], [[cross-country skiing]], [[horseback riding]], [[mountain biking]] and [[snowmobile]]s. These trails follow the shores of Canoe Lake and pass through [[woodland]]s, [[wetlands]], [[meadows]] and the historic limestone kilns. Hikers are asked to wear fluorescent orange, for safety matters, when hiking during [[hunting]] season.&lt;ref name="canoecreeksp"/&gt;

Canoe Creek State Park has a large picnic area near the lake. Charcoal grills are available for use. There are three [[pavilions]] for rent. Eight modern cabins are available to rent year-round. Each cabin sleeps six people and has electric heat, two bedrooms, living room, dining room, bathroom, and kitchen. Outside of the cabins are a fire ring and picnic table.&lt;ref name="canoecreeksp"/&gt;

The [[Terry Wentz]] Education Center is open year-round, near the modern cabins, and provides brochures on the education program and the wildlife of the park.&lt;ref name="canoecreeksp"/&gt;

[[File:Catalytic triad of TEV protease.png|thumb|360px|The enzyme [[TEV protease]]{{efn|name=TEV}} contains an example of a catalytic triad of residues (red) in its [[active site]]. The triad consists of an [[aspartate]] ([[acid]]), [[histidine]] ([[Base (chemistry)|base]]) and [[serine]] ([[nucleophile]]). The [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] (black) is bound by the [[binding site]] to orient it next to the triad. {{PDB|1lvm}}]]

A '''catalytic triad''' is a set of three coordinated [[amino acid]]s that can be found in the [[active site]] of some [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buller|first=AR|author2=Townsend, CA|date=Feb 19, 2013|title=Intrinsic evolutionary constraints on protease structure, enzyme acylation, and the identity of the catalytic triad|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=8|pages=E653–61|bibcode=2013PNAS..110E.653B|doi=10.1073/pnas.1221050110|pmc=3581919|pmid=23382230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads are most commonly found in [[hydrolase]] and [[transferase]] enzymes (e.g. [[protease]]s, [[amidase]]s, [[esterase]]s, acylases, [[lipase]]s and [[β-lactamase]]s). An [[Acid]]-[[Base (chemistry)|Base]]-[[Nucleophile]] triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for [[covalent catalysis]]. The [[Amino acid|residues]] form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]], forming a [[covalent]] intermediate which is then [[hydrolysed]] to release the [[Product (chemistry)|product]] and regenerate free enzyme. The nucleophile is most commonly a [[serine]] or [[cysteine]] amino acid, but occasionally [[threonine]] or even [[selenocysteine]]. The [[Protein tertiary structure|3D structure]] of the enzyme brings together the triad residues in a precise orientation, even though they may be far apart in the sequence ([[Protein primary structure|primary structure]]).&lt;ref name = "Stryer_Ch9"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H.

== Function ==
Enzymes that contain a catalytic triad use it for one of two reaction types: either to [[hydrolysis|split]] a substrate ([[hydrolase]]s) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate ([[transferase]]s). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the [[active site]] of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. [[binding site]] and [[oxyanion hole]]) to achieve [[nucleophilic catalysis]]. These triad residues act together to make the [[nucleophile]] member highly [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]], generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.

===Mechanism===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] using a residue as a nucleophile. The reactivity of the nucleophilic residue is increased by the [[functional group]]s of the other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.

Catalysis is performed in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the [[carbonyl]] carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen to accept an electron, leading to a tetrahedral [[reaction intermediate|intermediate]]. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an [[oxyanion hole]] within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting the first half of the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an [[acyl-enzyme intermediate]]. The ejection of this first [[leaving group]] is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.

The second stage of catalysis is the resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=PhD Thesis|last=Thomas|first=Shafee,|title=Evolvability of a viral protease: experimental evolution of catalysis, robustness and specificity|date=2014|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/245207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Triad mechanism.svg|1000px|General reaction mechanism of catalysed by a catalytic triad (black): [[nucleophilic substitution]] at a [[carbonyl]] substrate (red) by a second substrate (blue). First, the enzyme's nucleophile (X) attacks the carbonyl to form a covalently linked acyl-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by the second substrate's nucleophile (X'). If the second nucleophile is the hydroxyl of water, the result is hydrolysis, otherwise the result is [[Transferase#Reactions|group transfer]] of X'.}}

==Identity of triad members==
[[File:Triad chemical mech.png|thumb|300px|A catalytic triad charge-relay system as commonly found in proteases. The acid residue (commonly [[glutamate]] or [[aspartate]]) aligns and polarises the base (usually [[histidine]]) which activates the nucleophile (often serine or cysteine, occasionally [[threonine]]). The triad reduces the [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the nucleophilic residue which then attacks the substrate. An [[oxyanion hole]] of positively charged usually backbone [[amide]]s (occasionally side-chains) stabilise charge build-up on the substrate [[transition state]].]]

===Nucleophile===
The side-chain of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. The lone pair of electrons present on the oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive [[carbonyl]] carbon.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The 20 [[amino acid#Standard amino acids|naturally occurring biological amino acids]] do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult [[catalytic reaction]]s. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the [[hydroxyl]] (OH) of serine and the [[thiol]]/thiolate ion (SH/S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) of cysteine.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; Alternatively, [[threonine protease]]s use the [[secondary alcohol|secondary hydroxyl]] of threonine, however due to [[steric hindrance]] of the side chain's extra [[methyl group]] such proteases use their [[N-terminal|''N''-terminal]] amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt;

Use of oxygen or sulphur as the nucleophilic atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to [[Nucleophile#Oxygen|oxygen]], [[Nucleophile#sulphur|sulphur]]’s extra [[d orbital]] makes it larger (by 0.4 Å)&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642"&gt;{{cite journal|last = McGrath|first = ME|author2 = Wilke, ME|author3 = Higaki, JN|author4 = Craik, CS|author5 = Fletterick, RJ|title = Crystal structures of two engineered thiol trypsins.|journal = Biochemistry|date = Nov 28, 1989|volume = 28|issue = 24|pages = 9264–70|pmid = 2611228|doi = 10.1021/bi00450a005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and softer, allows it to form longer bonds (d&lt;sub href="thiol"&gt;C-X&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub href="Nucleophile#Oxygen"&gt;X-H&lt;/sub&gt; by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (by 5 units).&lt;ref name="polgár3232"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Polgár|first = L|author2 = Asbóth, B|title = The basic difference in catalyses by serine and cysteine proteinases resides in charge stabilization in the transition state.|journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology|date = Aug 7, 1986|volume = 121|issue = 3|pages = 323–6|pmid = 3540454|doi = 10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80111-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="polgár3232" /&gt; in order to achieve concerted [[deprotonation]] with catalysis.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first [[tetrahedral intermediate]] as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to [[protonate]] the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S&lt;sup href="deprotonation"&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Sterically]], the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier [[van der Waals radius]]&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; and if [[mutated]] to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642" /&gt;

Very rarely, the [[selenium]] atom of the uncommon amino acid [[selenocysteine]] is used as a nucleophile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The deprotonated Se&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; state is strongly favoured when in a catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Base===
Since no natural amino acids are strongly nucleophilic, the base in a catalytic triad [[Chemical polarity|polarise]]s and [[deprotonate]]s the nucleophile to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; Additionally, it [[protonate]]s the first [[Product (chemistry)|product]] to aid leaving group departure.

The base is most commonly histidine since its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=G|author2=Wlodawer, A|title=Catalytic triads and their relatives.|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1998|volume=23|issue=9|pages=347–52|pmid=9787641|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[β-lactamase]]s such as [[TEM-1]] use a [[lysine]] residue as the base. Because lysine's p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is so high (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damblon|first=C|author2=Raquet, X |author3=Lian, LY |author4=Lamotte-Brasseur, J |author5=Fonze, E |author6=Charlier, P |author7=Roberts, GC |author8= Frère, JM |title=The catalytic mechanism of beta-lactamases: NMR titration of an active-site lysine residue of the TEM-1 enzyme|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Mar 5, 1996|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1747–52|pmid=8700829|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.5.1747|bibcode=1996PNAS...93.1747D |pmc=39852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jelsch|first=C|author2=Lenfant, F |author3=Masson, JM |author4= Samama, JP |title=Beta-lactamase TEM1 of E. coli.

This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9" /&gt; Two amino acids have acidic [[Amino acid#Side chains|side chains]] at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) and so are the most commonly used for this triad member.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; [[Cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus}} uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} uses [[asparagine]] as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, [[hepatitis A]] virus protease{{efn|Hepatitis A virus protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C3}}}} contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.

==Examples of triads==
[[File:Triads and their substrates annotated.svg|thumb|500x500px|The range of amino acid residues used in different combinations in different enzymes to make up a catalytic triad for hydrolysis. On the left are the nucleophile, base and acid triad members. On the right are different substrates with the cleaved bond indicated by a pair of scissors. Two different bonds in [[beta-lactam]]s can be cleaved (1 by [[penicillin acylase]] and 2 by [[beta-lactamase]]).]]

===Ser-His-Asp===
The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif is one of the most thoroughly characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The triad is exemplified by [[chymotrypsin]],{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=S1}}}} a model serine protease from the [[PA clan|PA superfamily]] which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an [[oxyanion hole]] consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.

The same triad has also convergently evolved in [[α/β hydrolase]]s such as some [[lipase]]s and [[esterase]]s, however [[chirality|orientation]] of the triad members is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yueru|last2=Yin|first2=Shuhui|last3=Feng|first3=Yitao|last4=Li|first4=Jie|last5=Zhou|first5=Jiahai|last6=Liu|first6=Changdong|last7=Zhu|first7=Guang|last8=Guo|first8=Zhihong|date=2014-05-30|title=Molecular Basis of the General Base Catalysis of an α/β-Hydrolase Catalytic Triad|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/289/22/15867|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|language=en|volume=289|issue=22|pages=15867–15879|doi=10.1074/jbc.m113.535641|issn=0021-9258|pmid=24737327|pmc=4140940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauwerdink|first=Alissa|last2=Kazlauskas|first2=Romas J.|date=2015-10-02|title=How the Same Core Catalytic Machinery Catalyzes 17 Different Reactions: the Serine-Histidine-Aspartate Catalytic Triad of α/β-Hydrolase Fold Enzymes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5b01539|journal=ACS Catalysis|volume=5|issue=10|pages=6153–6176|doi=10.1021/acscatal.5b01539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, brain [[acetyl hydrolase]] (which has the same fold as a small [[G-protein]]) has also been found to have this triad. The equivalent Ser-His-''Glu ''triad is used in [[acetylcholinesterase]].

===Cys-His-Asp===
The second most studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif.&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt; Several families of [[cysteine protease]]s use this triad set, for example TEV protease{{efn|name=TEV|TEV protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C4}}}} and [[papain]].{{efn|name=papain|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}}} The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, with a few notable differences. Due to cysteine's low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, the importance of the Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. [[hepatitis A|hepatitis A virus]] protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain).&lt;ref name="beveridge1355"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beveridge|first=AJ|title=A theoretical study of the active sites of papain and S195C rat trypsin: implications for the low reactivity of mutant serine proteinases|journal=Protein Science|date=July 1996|volume=5|issue=7|pages=1355–65|pmid=8819168|pmc=2143470|doi=10.1002/pro.5560050714}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triad is also used by some amidases, such as [[Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase|''N''-glycanase]] to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The PUB Domain Functions as a p97 Binding Module in Human Peptide ''N''-Glycanase|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|year = 2006|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 16807242|pages = 25502–25508|volume = 281|issue = 35|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M601173200|first = Mark D.|last = Allen|first2 = Alexander|last2 = Buchberger|first3 = Mark|last3 = Bycroft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ser-His-His===
The triad of [[cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus|Cytomegalovirus protease {{MEROPS|clan=SH|fam=S21}}}} uses histidine as both the acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to &gt;10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.&lt;ref name="ekici2023"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekici|first=OD|author2=Paetzel, M |author3=Dalbey, RE |title=Unconventional serine proteases: variations on the catalytic Ser/His/Asp triad configuration.|journal=Protein Science|date=December 2008|volume=17|issue=12|pages=2023–37|pmid=18824507|doi=10.1110/ps.035436.108|pmc=2590910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ser-Glu-Asp===
An unusual triad is found in seldolisin proteases.{{efn|Seldolisin protease {{MEROPS|clan=SB|fam=53}}}} The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the glutamate carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH. The triad is hypothesised to be an [[adaptation]] to specific environments like [[acidic]] [[hot spring]]s (e.g. [[kumamolysin]]) or cell [[lysosome]] (e.g. [[tripeptidyl peptidase]]).&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt;

===Cys-His-Ser===
The [[Endothelium|endothelial]] protease [[VASH1|vasohibin]]{{efn|Vasohibin protease {{MEROPS|clan=CA}}|name=Vasohibin}} uses a cysteine as the nucleophile, but a serine to coordinate the histidine base.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanchez-Pulido|first=Luis|last2=Ponting|first2=Chris P.|date=2016-05-15|title=Vasohibins: new transglutaminase-like cysteine proteases possessing a non-canonical Cys-His-Ser catalytic triad|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/10/1441/1742608|journal=Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=32|issue=10|pages=1441–1445|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btv761|issn=1367-4803|pmc=4866520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sato|first=Yasufumi|last2=Sonoda|first2=Hikaru|date=2007-01-01|title=The Vasohibin Family: A Negative Regulatory System of Angiogenesis Genetically Programmed in Endothelial Cells|url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/27/1/37|journal=Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=37–41|doi=10.1161/01.atv.0000252062.48280.61|issn=1079-5642|pmid=17095714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the serine being a poor acid, it is still effective in orienting the histidine in the catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some homologues alternatively have a threonine instead of serine at the acid location.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Thr-Nter, Ser-Nter and Cys-Nter===
Threonine proteases, such as the [[proteasome]] protease subunit{{efn|name=Proteasome|Proteasome {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=T1}}}} and [[Glutamate N-acetyltransferase|ornithine acyltransferases]]{{efn|name=OAT|Ornithine acyltransferases {{MEROPS|clan=PE|fam=T5}}}} use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine in a manner analogous to the use of the serine [[primary alcohol|primary hydroxyl]].&lt;ref name="brannigan416"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brannigan|first=JA|author2=Dodson, G |author3=Duggleby, HJ |author4=Moody, PC |author5=Smith, JL |author6=Tomchick, DR |author7= Murzin, AG |title=A protein catalytic framework with an ''N''-terminal nucleophile is capable of self-activation|journal=Nature|date=Nov 23, 1995|volume=378|issue=6555|pages=416–9|pmid=7477383|doi=10.1038/378416a0|bibcode=1995Natur.378..416B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheng1902"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=H|author2=Grishin, NV|title=DOM-fold: a structure with crossing loops found in DmpA, ornithine acetyltransferase, and molybdenum cofactor-binding domain.|journal=Protein Science|date=July 2005|volume=14|issue=7|pages=1902–10|pmid=15937278|doi=10.1110/ps.051364905|pmc=2253344}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the steric interference of the extra methyl group of threonine, the base member of the triad is the ''N''-terminal amide which polarises an ordered water which, in turn, [[deprotonates]] the catalytic hydroxyl to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt; Similarly, there exist equivalent 'serine only' and 'cysteine only' configurations such as [[penicillin acylase]] G{{efn|Penicillin acylase G {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=S45}}}} and [[penicillin acylase]] V{{efn|Penicillin acylase V {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C59}}}} which are evolutionarily related to the proteasome proteases. Again, these use their ''N''-terminal amide as a base.&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

===Ser-''cis''Ser-Lys===
This unusual triad occurs only in one superfamily of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise the middle serine.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shin|first=S|author2=Yun, YS |author3=Koo, HM |author4=Kim, YS |author5=Choi, KY |author6= Oh, BH |title=Characterization of a novel Ser-cisSer-Lys catalytic triad in comparison with the classical Ser-His-Asp triad.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Jul 4, 2003|volume=278|issue=27|pages=24937–43|pmid=12711609|doi=10.1074/jbc.M302156200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one with the side chain hydroxyl and the other with the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual ''[[Cis–trans isomerism|cis]]'' orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and ''cis''-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerqueira|first=N.

===Sec-His-Glu===
The rare, but naturally occurring amino acid [[selenocysteine]] (Sec), can also be found as the nucleophile in some catalytic triads.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Wolfgang|last2=Wessjohann|first2=Ludger A.|date=2005-02-04|title=The Functional Role of Selenocysteine (Sec) in the Catalysis Mechanism of Large Thioredoxin Reductases: Proposition of a Swapping Catalytic Triad Including a Sec-His-Glu State|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbic.200400276/abstract|journal=ChemBioChem|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=386–394|doi=10.1002/cbic.200400276|issn=1439-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenocysteine is similar to cysteine, but contains a [[selenium]] atom instead of a sulphur. An example is in the active site of [[thioredoxin reductase]], which uses the selenium for reduction of disulphide in thioredoxin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Engineered triads===
In addition to naturally occurring types of catalytic triads, [[protein engineering]] has been used to create enzyme variants with non-native amino acids, or entirely synthetic amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toscano|first=Miguel D.|last2=Woycechowsky|first2=Kenneth J.|last3=Hilvert|first3=Donald|date=2007-04-27|title=Minimalist Active-Site Redesign: Teaching Old Enzymes New Tricks|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200604205/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=46|issue=18|pages=3212–3236|doi=10.1002/anie.200604205|issn=1521-3773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads have also been inserted into otherwise non-catalytic proteins, or protein mimics.

The triad remains the core of the active site, but it is evolutionarily [[adaptation|adapted]] to serve different functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How far divergent evolution goes in proteins|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X98800730|journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology|date = June 1998|pages = 380–387|volume = 8|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/S0959-440X(98)80073-0|first = Alexey G|last = Murzin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Divergent Evolution of Enzymatic Function: Mechanistically Diverse Superfamilies and Functionally Distinct Suprafamilies|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.209|journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry|date = 2001|pmid = 11395407|pages = 209–246|volume = 70|issue = 1|doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.209|first = John A.|last = Gerlt|first2 = Patricia C.|last2 = Babbitt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proteins, called [[pseudoenzyme]]s, have non-catalytic functions (e.g. regulation by inhibitory binding) and have accumulated mutations that inactivate their catalytic triad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=JM|last2=Farhan|first2=H|last3=Eyers|first3=PA|year=2017|title=Bio-Zombie: the rise of pseudoenzymes in biology|url=|journal=Biochem Soc Trans|volume=45|issue=|pages=537–544|doi=10.1042/bst20160400|pmid=28408493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction changes ===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate is resolved by water, the result is hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a [[transferase]]. For example, attack by an [[acyl]] group results in an [[acyltransferase]] reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sinapoyltransferases in the light of molecular evolution|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942209002970|journal = Phytochemistry|date = October 2009|pages = 1652–1662|volume = 70|series = Evolution of Metabolic Diversity|issue = 15–16|doi = 10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.07.023|first = Felix|last = Stehle|first2 = Wolfgang|last2 = Brandt|first3 = Milton T.|last3 = Stubbs|first4 = Carsten|last4 = Milkowski|first5 = Dieter|last5 = Strack|pmid=19695650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In different members of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, the Ser-His-Asp triad is tuned by surrounding residues to perform at least 17 different reactions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimitriou|first=Polytimi S.|last2=Denesyuk|first2=Alexander|last3=Takahashi|first3=Seiji|last4=Yamashita|first4=Satoshi|last5=Johnson|first5=Mark S.|last6=Nakayama|first6=Toru|last7=Denessiouk|first7=Konstantin|date=2017-10-01|title=Alpha/beta-hydrolases: A unique structural motif coordinates catalytic acid residue in 40 protein fold families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.25338/abstract|journal=Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=85|issue=10|pages=1845–1855|doi=10.1002/prot.25338|issn=1097-0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these reactions are also achieved with mechanisms that have altered formation, or resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, or that don't proceed via an acyl-enzyme intermediate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Additionally, an alternative transferase mechanism has been evolved by [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]]s, which has two active sites.{{efn|amidophosphoribosyltransferase {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C44}}}} In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a [[glutamine]] substrate to release free ammonia.

Divergent evolution of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease [[Protein superfamily|superfamilies]] have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This can be inferred when a superfamily (with the same [[protein structure|fold]]) contains [[protein family|families]] that use different nucleophiles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.&lt;ref name="pmid19892822"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Within protease superfamilies that contain a mixture of nucleophiles (e.g. the [[PA clan]]), families are designated by their catalytic nucleophile (C=cysteine proteases, S=serine proteases).

The [[enzymology]] of proteases provides some of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme [[Superfamily (proteins)|superfamilies]]. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different [[Protein tertiary structure|structural fold]]. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt;

=== Cysteine and serine hydrolases ===
The same triad geometries been converged upon by serine proteases such as the [[chymotrypsin]]{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin}} and [[subtilisin]] superfamilies. Similar convergent evolution has occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral [[C3 protease]] and [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

=== Threonine proteases ===
Threonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or histidine base.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; When the nucleophile of a serine protease was mutated to threonine, the methyl occupied a mixture of positions, most of which prevented substrate binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelc|first=Leslie A.|last2=Chen|first2=Zhiwei|last3=Gohara|first3=David W.|last4=Vogt|first4=Austin D.|last5=Pozzi|first5=Nicola|last6=Di Cera|first6=Enrico|date=2015-02-24|title=Why Ser and Not Thr Brokers Catalysis in the Trypsin Fold|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|journal=Biochemistry|volume=54|issue=7|pages=1457–1464|doi=10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|issn=0006-2960|pmc=4342846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it ''N''-terminus.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

Two evolutionarily independent [[enzyme superfamilies]] with different protein folds are known to use the ''N''-terminal residue as a nucleophile: Superfamily PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold)&lt;ref name="brannigan416" /&gt; and Superfamily PE ([[acetyltransferase]]s using the DOM fold)&lt;ref name="cheng1902" /&gt; This commonality of [[active site]] structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7170">The '''evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis''' was first proposed by Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold in 1995 as a way to explain the success of invasive, [[non-indigenous species]] (in particular, plants). Observing that:
# there is usually a lag period between the time of introduction of an [[invasive species]] and the point at which it is considered invasive, and
# invasive plants seem to be more virulent in habitats into which they have been introduced (as compared to their native habitats), the scientists presumed a sort of [[naturalization]] through modification for non-indigenous plants.
Because of a lack of native [[predation]], the scientists reasoned, introduced plants are able to reallocate resources from defense mechanisms into growth and development. Introduced plants can thereby [[evolution|evolve]] to grow taller, produce more [[biomass]], and yield more [[:wikt:viable|viable]] offspring than their native counterparts, according to the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/Blossey_Notzold_1995.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Blossey and Nötzold tested their hypothesis on ''[[Lythrum salicaria]]'' (purple loosetrife) by potting seeds from plants growing in Ithaca, New York, U.S.A., and Lucelle, Switzerland. The seeds were allowed to [[germinate]] in a lab at Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, northern Germany, and observed for two years. True to the predictions of the EICA Hypothesis, the plants derived from Ithaca produced significantly more biomass that the plants derived from Lucelle. The ''Lythrum salicaria'' plants derived from Ithaca also grew taller and were significantly less resistant to the root-feeding [[weevil]] present over its native range.

==Significance==

Unlike the notable ideas (concerning the success of invasive non-indigenous organisms) that preceded it, such as the [[enemy release hypothesis]] (ERH) and [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Habituation Hypothesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species. Pg. 114–116. Harvard University Press: eighteenth printing, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the EICA hypothesis [[postulate]]s that an invasive species is ''not'' as fit (in its introduced habitat) at its moment of introduction as it is at the time that it is considered invasive. As suggested by the name of the hypothesis (Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability), the hypothesis predicts that much of the invasive potential of an invasive species is derived from its ability to evolve to reallocate its resources.

This idea is troubling{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} in that it adds a new variable to "invasive potential", making it harder to predict whether or not a species will become invasive if it is introduced into a new area. In other words, the EICA hypothesis presents a new environmental safety concern. If its postulates hold, in the long run, [[introduced species]] may have to be more highly regulated than they are at present, because no set of [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] or pattern of introduction can predict the extent to which an organism can reallocate its resources in response to a release from stress.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Scientific support and revision==

Since its debut in 1995, Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold's paper, "Evolution of increased competitive ability in invasive nonindigenous plants: a hypothesis" has been met with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The paper has been cited in over 368 articles in [[scientific journals]], including [[review articles]], tests of the hypothesis using different [[model species]], and expansions and reformulations of the hypothesis. Among the model species on which the hypothesis has been evaluated most recently (in its original form) are ''[[Solidago gigantea]]'' (giant goldenrod),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/e5v2m075252j1202/ Altered patterns of growth, physiology and reproduction in invasive genotypes of Solidago gigantea (Asteraceae)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sapium sebiferum]]'' (Chinese Tallow),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l847377740371176/ Increased competitive ability and herbivory tolerance in the invasive plant Sapium sebiferum]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Lepidium draba]]'' (whitetop).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a0402043431336n7/ No difference in competitive ability between invasive North American and native European Lepidium draba populations]&lt;/ref&gt; Of these three model species, the success and behavior of ''Sapium sebifurum'' agreed most closely with the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, according to the researches conducting the study. In its study, the success and behavior of ''Solidago gigantea'' was only partially explained by the EICA hypothesis, according to its researchers. ''Lepidium draba'' did not seem to follow any of the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, as the researchers of the study understood them.

Through most of the studies done on the EICA Hypothesis (see examples above), it holds that the introduced populations of invasive plant species are less able to cope with the pressures of specialist [[herbivores]] than native populations of the same species are, suggesting that invasive species ''do'' respond to accelerated [[natural selection]] after being released from the [[selective pressure]] of specialist herbivores and ''do'' have the potential to reallocate resources away from specific forms of defense. However, not all of these introduced populations produce significantly more biomass than the native populations of the same species under laboratory conditions. A study conducted by Bossdorf et al. in 2004 on ''Alliaria petiolata'' (garlic mustard) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00583.x Blackwell Synergy – Ecol Letters, Volume 7 Issue 4 Page 346-353, April 2004 (Article Abstract)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; may lend some insight into this discrepancy. Bossdorf et al. potted seeds from native and introduced populations of ''Alliaria petiolata'' and put them in direct competition with one another in a laboratory setting (i.e. the native and introduced populations were grown on in the same pot of soil, and subjected to the same treatments), and found that in direct competition, the native populations were able to out-compete the invasive populations. Bossdorf et al. proposed that this observation could result from the fact that there is a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] cost to traits that increase so-called "competitive ability". Under this assumption, invasive populations of ''Alliaria petiolata'' had evolved a higher fitness (similar to ''Lythrum Salicaria'') in their introduced ranges at the cost of certain defense mechanisms ''and'' at the cost of certain aspects of growth and development (dissimilar to ''Lythrum Salicaria''). It could be, therefore, that the EICA Hypothesis is too narrow in scope, and should be reworded to place an emphasis on an invasive species' ability to reallocate its resources in order to procure a fitness advantage that may or may not involve more vigorous growth and development.

The '''fusion energy gain factor''', usually expressed with the symbol '''''Q''''', is the ratio of [[fusion power]] produced in a [[nuclear fusion]] reactor to the power required to maintain the [[Plasma physics|plasma]]  in [[steady state]]. The condition of ''Q'' = 1, when the power being released by the fusion reactions is equal to the required heating power, is referred to as '''breakeven'''.

The power given off by the fusion reactions may be captured within the fuel, leading to ''self-heating''. Most fusion reactions release at least some of their energy in a form that cannot be captured within the plasma, so a system at ''Q'' = 1 will cool without external heating. With typical fuels, self-heating in fusion reactors is not expected to match the external sources until at least ''Q'' = 5. If ''Q'' increases past this point, increasing self-heating eventually removes the need for external heating. At this point the reaction becomes self-sustaining, a condition called '''ignition'''. Ignition corresponds to infinite ''Q'', and is generally regarded as highly desirable for a practical reactor design.

Over time, several related terms have entered the fusion lexicon. As a reactor does not cover its own heating losses until about ''Q'' = 5, the term '''engineering breakeven''' is sometimes used to describe a reactor that produces enough electricity to provide that heating. Above engineering breakeven a machine would produce more electricity than it uses, and could sell that excess. A machine that can sell enough electricity to cover its operating costs, estimated to require at least ''Q'' = 20, is sometimes known as '''economic breakeven'''.

{{Asof|2017}}, the record for ''Q'' is held by the [[Joint European Torus|JET]] tokamak in the UK, at ''Q'' = (16 MW)/(24 MW) ≈ 0.67, first attained in 1997. [[ITER]] was originally designed to reach ignition, but is currently designed to reach ''Q'' = 10, producing 500&amp;nbsp;MW of fusion power from 50&amp;nbsp;MW of injected thermal power.

==Concept==
''Q'' is simply the comparison of the [[Fusion power|power]] being released by the fusion reactions in a reactor, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;, to the constant heating power being supplied, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;. However, there are several definitions of breakeven that consider additional power losses.

===Breakeven===
In 1955, [[John D. Lawson (scientist)|John Lawson]] was the first to explore the energy balance mechanisms in detail, initially in classified works but published openly in a now-famous 1957 paper. In this paper he considered and refined work by earlier researchers, notably [[Hans Thirring]], [[Peter Thonemann]], and a review article by [[Richard Post]]. Expanding on all of these, Lawson's paper made detailed predictions for the amount of power that would be lost through various mechanisms, and compared that to the energy needed to sustain the reaction.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|p=6}} This balance is today known as the [[Lawson criterion]].

In a successful fusion reactor design, the fusion reactions generate an amount of power designated ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;.{{efn|This was denoted ''P''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; in Lawson's original paper, but changed here to match modern terminology.}} Some amount of this energy, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;, is lost through a variety of mechanisms, mostly convection of the fuel to the walls of the reactor chamber and various forms of radiation that cannot be captured to generate power. In order to keep the reaction going, the system has to provide heating to make up for these losses, where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; to maintain thermal equilibrium.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|pp=8-9}}

The most basic definition of breakeven is when ''Q'' = 1,{{efn|In Lawson's original paper, the term ''Q'' was used to denote the total energy released by the individual fusion reactions, in MeV, and ''R'' referred to the power balance.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|p=6}} Later works used ''Q'' to refer to the power balance, as it is used in this article.}} that is, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;.

Some works refer to this definition as '''scientific breakeven''', to contrast it with similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=American Nuclear Society |url=http://www.ans.org/pubs/journals/fst/a_22885 |title= The Mirror Fusion Test Facility: An Intermediate Device to a Mirror Fusion Reactor  |first=V. N. |last=Karpenko |volume=4 |number=2P2 |date=September 1983 |doi=10.13182/FST83-A22885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= 17th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference |url=https://cordis.europa.eu/event/rcn/9860_en.html | date =19 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this usage is rare outside certain areas, specifically the [[inertial confinement fusion]] field, where the term is much more widely used.

===Extrapolated breakeven===
Since the 1950s, most commercial fusion reactor designs have been based on a mix of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] as their primary fuel; others fuels have been studied for a variety of reasons but are much harder to ignite. As tritium is radioactive, highly bioactive and highly mobile, it represents a significant safety concern and adds to the cost of designing and operating such a reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |url=https://thebulletin.org/2017/04/fusion-reactors-not-what-theyre-cracked-up-to-be/ |title=Fusion reactors: Not what they’re cracked up to be |date=19 April 2017 |first=Daniel |last=Jassby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to lower costs, many experimental machines are designed to run on test fuels of hydrogen or deuterium alone, leaving out the tritium. In this case, the term '''extrapolated breakeven''' is used to define the expected performance of the machine running on D-T fuel based on the performance when running on hydrogen or deuterium alone.&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ees.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~web_dai5/english/B.html |title=Plasma Dictionary |website=Nagoya University |first= M. A. |last=Razzak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The records for extrapolated breakeven are slightly higher than the records for scientific breakeven. Both JET and JT-60 have reached values around 1.25 (see below for details) while running on D-D fuel. When running on D-T, only possible in JET, the maximum performance is about half the extrapolated value.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

===Engineering breakeven===
Another related term, '''engineering breakeven''', considers the need to extract the energy from the reactor, turn that into electrical energy, and feed that back into the heating system.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; This closed loop is known as ''recirculation''. In this case, the basic definition changes by adding additional terms to the ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; side to consider the efficiencies of these processes.

Most fusion reactions release energy in a variety of forms, mostly [[neutron]]s and a variety of charged particles like [[alpha particle]]s. Neutrons are electrically neutral and will travel out of any [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (MFE) design, and in spite of the very high densities found in [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) designs, they tend to easily escape the fuel mass in these designs as well. This means that only the charged particles from the reactions can be captured within the fuel mass and give rise to self-heating. If the fraction of the energy being released in the charged particles is ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;, then the power in these particles is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;. If this self-heating process is perfect, that is, all of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; is captured in the fuel, that means the power available for generating electricity is the power that is not released in that form, or (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;)''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the case of neutrons carrying most of the practical energy, as is the case in the D-T fuel studied in most designs, this neutron energy is normally captured in a "blanket" of  [[lithium]] that produces more tritium that is used to fuel the reactor. Due to various [[exothermic]] and [[endothermic]] reactions, the blanket may have a power gain factor a few percent higher or lower than 100%, but that will be neglected here. The blanket is then cooled and the [[cooling fluid]] used in a [[heat exchanger]] driving conventional [[steam turbine]]s. These have an efficiency η&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; which is around 35 to 40%.

Consider a system that uses external heaters to heat the fusion fuel, then extracts the power from those reactions to generate electrical power. Some fraction of that power, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt;, is needed to recirculate back into the heaters to close the loop. This is not the same as the ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; because the self-heating processes are providing some of the required energy. While the system as a whole requires additional power for building climate control, lighting, and the confinement system, these are generally much smaller than the plasma heating system requirements.
 
Considering all of these factors, the heating power can thus be related to the fusion power by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;P_{heat} = \eta_{heat} \cdot f_{recirc}\cdot  \eta_{elec}\cdot  (1-f_{ch})\cdot P_{fus}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta_{heat}&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency that power supplied to the heating systems is turned into heat in the fuel, as opposed to lost in the equipment itself, and &lt;math&gt;\eta_{elec}&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency achieved when turning the heat into electrical power, for instance, through the [[Rankine cycle]].

The fusion energy gain factor is then defined as:

&lt;math&gt; Q_E \equiv \frac{P_{fus}}{P_{heat}} = \frac{1}{\eta_{heat} \cdot f_{recirc}\cdot  \eta_{elec}\cdot  (1-f_{ch})} &lt;/math&gt;

===Ignition===
As the temperature of the plasma increases, the rate of fusion reactions grows rapidly, and with it, the rate of self heating. In contrast, the non-capturable energy losses like x-rays do not grow at the same rate. Thus, in overall terms, the self-heating process becomes more efficient as the temperature increases, and less energy is needed from external sources to keep it hot.

Eventually ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; reaches zero, that is, all of the energy needed to keep the plasma at the operational temperature is being supplied by self-heating, and the amount of external energy that needs to be added drops to zero. This point is known as '''ignition'''.

Ignition, by definition, corresponds to an infinite ''Q'', but it does not mean that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt; drops to zero as the other power sinks in the system, like the magnets and cooling systems, still need to be powered. Generally, however, these are much smaller than the energy in the heaters, and require a much smaller ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt;. More importantly, this number is more likely to be near constant, meaning that further improvements in plasma performance will result in more energy that can be directly used for commercial generation, as opposed to recirculation.

===Commercial breakeven===
The final definition of breakeven is '''commercial breakeven''', which occurs when the economic value of any net energy left over after recirculation is enough to finance the construction of the reactor.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; This value depends both on the reactor and the [[spot price]] of electrical power.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary |website=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/education/glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial breakeven relies on factors outside the technology of the reactor itself, and it is possible that even a reactor with a fully ignited plasma will not generate enough energy to pay for itself. Whether any of the mainline concepts like [[ITER]] can reach this goal is being debated in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://issues.org/31-4/fusion-research-time-to-set-a-new-path/ |title=Fusion Research: Time to Set a New Path |first=Robert |last=Hirsch |date=Summer 2015 |magazine=Issues in Technology |volume=31 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical example==
Most fusion reactor designs being studied {{asof|2017|lc=yes}} are based on the D-T reaction, as this is by far the easiest to ignite, and is energy dense. However, this reaction also gives off most of its energy in the form of a single highly energetic neutron, and only 20% of the energy in the form of an alpha. Thus, for the D-T reaction, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2. This means that self-heating does not become equal to the external heating until at least ''Q'' = 5. 

Efficiency values depend on design details but may be in the range of η&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.7 (70%) and η&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.4 (40%). The purpose of a fusion reactor is to produce power, not to recirculate it, so a practical reactor must have ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2 approximately. Lower would be better but will be hard to achieve. Using these values we find for a practical reactor ''Q'' = 22.

==Transient vs. continual==
Many early fusion devices operated for microseconds, using some sort of pulsed power source to feed their [[magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic confinement]] system and used the confinement as the heating source. Lawson defined breakeven in this context as the total energy released by the entire reaction cycle compared to the total energy supplied to the machine during the same cycle.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Over time, as performance increased by orders of magnitude, the reaction times have extended from microseconds to seconds, and in [[ITER]], on the order of minutes. In this case definition of "the entire reaction cycle" becomes blurred. In the case of an ignited plasma, for instance, P&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; may be quite high while the system is being set up, and then drop to zero when it is fully developed, so one may be tempted to pick an instant in time when it is operating at its best to determine ''Q''. A better solution in these cases is to use the original Lawson definition averaged over the reaction to produce a similar value as the original definition.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

However, there is a complication. During the heating phase when the system is being brought up to operational conditions, some of the energy released by the fusion reactions will be used to heat the surrounding fuel, and thus not be released. This is no longer true when the plasma reaches its operational temperature and enters thermal equilibrium. Thus, if one averages over the entire cycle, this energy will be included as part of the heating term, that is, some of the energy that was captured for heating would otherwise have been released in P&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; and is therefore not indicative of an operational ''Q''.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Operators of the JET reactor argued that this input should be removed from the total:

&lt;math&gt; Q* \equiv \frac{P_{fus}}{P_{heat} - P_{temp}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt; P_{temp} = \frac{dWp}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

That is, P&lt;sub&gt;temp&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of energy needed to raise the internal energy of the plasma. It is this definition that was used when reporting JET's record 0.67 value.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Some debate over this definition continues. In 1998, the operators of the [[JT-60]] claimed to have reached ''Q'' = 1.25 running on D-D fuel, thus reaching extrapolated breakeven. However, this measurement was based on the JET definition of Q*. Using this definition, JET had also reached extrapolated breakeven some time earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-jt60.naka.jaea.go.jp/english/html/exp_rep/rep46.html |title=JT-60U Reaches 1.25 of Equivalent Fusion Power Gain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106002827/http://www-jt60.naka.jaea.go.jp/english/html/exp_rep/rep46.html |archive-date=6 January 2013 |date=7 August 1998 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one considers the energy balance in these conditions, and the analysis of previous machines, it is argued the original definition should be used, and thus both machines remain well below break-even of any sort.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

==Scientific breakeven at NIF==
Although most fusion experiments use some form of magnetic confinement, another major branch is [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) that mechanically presses together the fuel mass (the "target") to increase its density. This greatly increases the rate of fusion events and lowers the need to confine the fuel for long periods. This compression is accomplished by heating a lightweight capsule holding the fuel so rapidly that it explodes outwards, driving the fuel mass on the inside inward in accordance with [[Newton's third law]]. There are a variety of proposed "drivers" to cause the implosion process, but to date most experiments have used [[laser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://kfe.fjfi.cvut.cz/~limpouch/plazma/Pfalzner_Introduction_ICF.pdf |title=An Introduction to Inertial Confinement Fusion |first=S. |last=Pfalzner |publisher=CRC Press |date=2006 |pages=13-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Using the traditional definition of ''Q'', ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;, ICF devices have extremely low ''Q''. This is because the laser is extremely inefficient; whereas &lt;math&gt;\eta_{heat}&lt;/math&gt; for the heaters used in magnetic systems might be on the order of 70%, lasers are on the order of 1.5%. For this reason, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the leader in ICF research, has proposed another modification of ''Q'' that defines ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; as the energy delivered by the driver, as opposed to the energy put into the driver. This definition produces much higher ''Q'' values, and changes the definition of breakeven to be ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''&lt;sub&gt;laser&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. On occasion, they referred to this definition as "scientific breakeven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title=Status of the NIF Project |first=Edward |last=Moses |date=4 May 2007 |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Applied Optics |first=H.

On 7 October 2013, the BBC announced that LLNL had achieved scientific breakeven in the [[National Ignition Facility]]  (NIF) on 29 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24429621 |date=7 October 2013 |title=Nuclear fusion milestone passed at US lab |first=Paul |last=Rincon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Nature |url=https://www.nature.com/news/laser-fusion-experiment-extracts-net-energy-from-fuel-1.14710 |title=Laser fusion experiment extracts net energy from fuel |first=Philip |last=Ball |date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=HiPER |url=http://www.hiper-laser.org/News%20and%20events/index.html |title=Latest Fusion Results from the National Ignition Facility |date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; was approximately 14&amp;nbsp;kJ, while the laser output was 1.8&amp;nbsp;MJ. By their previous definition, this would be a ''Q'' of 0.0077. However, for this press release, they re-defined ''Q'' once again, this time equating ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; to be only the amount energy delivered to "the hottest portion of the fuel", calculating that only 10&amp;nbsp;kJ of the original laser energy reached the part of the fuel that was undergoing fusion reactions. This release has been heavily criticized in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=FIRE |url=https://fire.pppl.gov/ICF_Scientific_Breakeven_LLNL2.pdf |title=Scientific Breakeven for Fusion Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Science |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/10/fusion-breakthrough-nif-uh-not-really |title=Fusion "Breakthrough" at NIF?

The reddish area bordering the large inland lake is the [[Draining and development of the Everglades#Everglades Agricultural Area|Everglades Agricultural Area]].]]

The '''geography and ecology of the Everglades''' involve the complex elements affecting the natural environment throughout the southern region of the U.S. state of [[Florida]]. [[Draining and development of the Everglades|Before drainage]], the [[Everglades]] were an interwoven mesh of [[marsh]]es and [[prairie]]s covering {{convert|4000|sqmi|km2}}. The Everglades is simultaneously a vast [[drainage basin|watershed]] that has historically extended from [[Lake Okeechobee]] {{convert|100|mi|km}} south to [[Florida Bay]] (around one-third of the southern Florida peninsula), and many interconnected ecosystems within a geographic boundary. It is such a unique meeting of water, land, and climate that the use of either singular or plural to refer to the Everglades is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas]] wrote her definitive description of the region in 1947, she used the metaphor "River of Grass" to explain the blending of water and plant life.

Although [[Cladium|sawgrass]] and [[Swamp|sloughs]] are the enduring geographical icons of the Everglades, other ecosystems are just as vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood [[hammock (ecology)|hammocks]] are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the [[peat]], [[marl]], or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are [[Taxodium|cypresses]], whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater for months at a time. The Big Cypress Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; [[mangrove]] forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.

These ecological systems are always changing due to environmental factors. Geographic features such as the Western Flatwoods, Eastern Flatwoods, and the Atlantic Coastal Ridge affect drainage patterns. Geologic elements, climate, and the frequency of storms and fire are formative processes for the Everglades. They help to sustain and transform the ecosystems in the Shark River Valley, Big Cypress Swamp, coastal areas and mangrove forests. Ecosystems have been described as both fragile and resilient. Minor fluctuations in water levels have far-reaching consequences for many plant and animal species, and the system cycles and pulses with each change.

== Shaping processes of ecosystems ==
At only 5,000 years of age, the Everglades is a young region in geological terms. Its ecosystems are in constant flux as a result of the interplay of three factors: the type and amount of water present, the geology of the region, and the frequency and severity of fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Water ===
[[Image:Storm at Shark River in Everglades.jpg|thumb|A storm over the Shark River in the Everglades, 1966&lt;br&gt;Photo:Charles Barron / State Library and Archives of Florida]]

Water is the dominant element in the Everglades, and it shapes the land, vegetation, and animal life of South Florida. The South Florida climate was once [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]], interspersed with wet periods. Between 10,000 and 20,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, sea levels rose, submerging portions of the Florida peninsula and causing the [[water table]] to rise. Fresh water saturated the [[limestone]], eroding some of it and creating [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[sinkhole]]s. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and through evaporation formed [[thunderstorm]]s. Limestone was dissolved by the slightly acidic rainwater. The limestone wore away, and groundwater came into contact with the surface, creating a massive wetland ecosystem.&lt;ref name="McCally"&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the region appears flat, the wearing away of the limestone in some areas created slight valleys and plateaus—a difference of inches in elevation—that affected not only the flow of water, but also types of vegetation present.

The Everglades are unique; no other wetland system in the world is nourished primarily from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge,&amp;nbsp;p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the first attempt at draining the Everglades in 1882, the entire [[drainage basin|watershed]] extended from [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] to [[Florida Bay]] comprising the [[Kissimmee River|Kissimmee]]–[[Lake Okeechobee]]–Everglades (KLOE) watershed. Kissimmee River outlets flow into Lake Okeechobee, which sits {{convert|18|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Only two seasons exist in the Everglades: wet (May to November) and dry (December to April). Average annual rainfall in the Everglades is approximately {{convert|62|in|cm}}, though fluctuations of precipitation are normal.&lt;ref name="usgs climate"&gt;

The gradient change is so slight that the river moves only {{convert|2|ft|m}} a minute.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Sawgrass thrives in this river, dominates freshwater marshes and [[Swamp|sloughs]], and is the main characteristic of the region.

Severe weather, in the form of [[tropical cyclone|tropical storms and hurricanes]], also affects the structure of the Everglades. Between 1871 and 2003, 40&amp;nbsp;tropical cyclones struck the Everglades, usually every one to three years.&lt;ref name="hurdat"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division |year=2008 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/tracks1851to2007-apr08.txt |title=Atlantic hurricane best track |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=2008-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916070017/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/tracks1851to2007-apr08.txt |archivedate=2008-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt; These storms alter the coastline, flush decaying vegetation from [[estuary|estuaries]], strip weakened branches from trees, and disperse seeds, pollen, and plant material.&lt;ref&gt;Jewell, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hurricane Donna]] in 1960 affected {{convert|120|sqmi|km2}} of [[mangrove]] forests by depositing [[marl]] over the roots and depriving the trees of oxygen. It also eradicated [[Orchidaceae|orchids]], [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]], and other [[epiphyte]]s that once flourished in the mangroves; their reappearance may take a century or more. Donna also significantly spread [[Conocarpus|buttonwood]], [[saltwort]], and [[Salicornia|glasswort]], and epiphytes began to grow in new areas.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;89–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the lasting effects remain to be seen, [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 also destroyed mangrove forests and snapped slash pines in half. However, regrowth occurred quickly, and sand deposited by the storm surge improved nesting conditions for [[American crocodile|crocodiles]] and [[sea turtle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Toops, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geology ===
{{Further|Everglades#Geology}}

A vast marshland could only have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida.&lt;ref name="gleason"&gt;Gleason, Patrick, Peter Stone, "Age, Origins, and Landscape Evolution of the Everglades Peatland" in ''Everglades: The Ecosystem and its Restoration'', Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), St. Lucie Press. {{ISBN|0-9634030-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floor of the Everglades formed between 25&amp;nbsp;million and 2&amp;nbsp;million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation.&lt;ref name="gleason"/&gt; The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of [[calcium carbonate]] were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized [[bryozoa]]ns and tiny shells, or [[ooid]]s, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a ''hydroperiod'',&lt;ref name="McCally"/&gt; determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.

Shorter hydroperiods of three or four months promote the growth of [[periphyton]]: algae and other microscopic organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals.&lt;ref name="gleason"/&gt; Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, [[peat]] builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.

Five types of peat appear in the Everglades system; each type supports a specific type of vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–17&lt;/ref&gt; Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]]. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into [[carbon dioxide]] and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as the peat deteriorated; other areas lost approximately {{convert|8|ft|m}} of soil depth.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1880s and 2005, an estimated 3.4 billion metric tons of soil has been lost in the Everglades due to oxidation. Most of that loss occurs in the Everglades Agricultural Area; the least amount of loss is found in Everglades National Park.&lt;ref&gt;SFWMD (2010), p. 6-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fire ===
[[Image:Fire in the Everglades.jpg|thumb|left|Fire near a cypress dome in the Turner River area in the early 1920s]]

Fire is another important element in the maintenance of the Everglades. The majority are caused by [[lightning]] strikes from [[thunderstorm]]s during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: [[Cladium|sawgrass]] will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than [[decomposition]].&lt;ref name="lodgefire"&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas.&lt;ref&gt;

  | accessdate = 2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic [[peat]] and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225&amp;nbsp;years for one foot (0.3&amp;nbsp;m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000&amp;nbsp;years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.&lt;ref name="mccallyfire"/&gt;

Researchers have noted that fires appear in cycles associated with those of the hydroperiods.&lt;ref name="mccallyfire"&gt;McCally, p.&amp;nbsp;18–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The first cycle is the annual wet-season fires that occur with rapid frequency during the summer, but are quickly extinguished. Dry-season fires are rarer due to the lack of lightning, but their damage may be more pervasive.&lt;ref name="lodgefire"/&gt; A longer fire cycle spanning ten to fourteen years coincides with similar water cycles affected by global climate conditions. Fires in this cycle may be numerous and have little effect, or rare and have catastrophic consequences. The third cycle appears in a 550-year frequency associated with severe drought. Layers of [[charcoal]] have been detected inside peat in parts of the Everglades, indicating the region endured severe fires for years at a time, although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence around 940 [[BCE]].&lt;ref name="mccallyfire"/&gt;

== Ecosystem characteristics ==
[[Image:Historic Everglades Regions.jpg|thumb|alt=A color satellite image of the lower third of the Florida peninsula with labels superimposed over major landscapes before human alterations: directly to the south of Lake Okeechobee is a thin custard apple and cypress swamp, a much larger cypress swamp borders the lake to the east, and a major section of western pine flatwoods borders it to the west. Massive sawgrass plains are formed to the south of the custard apple swamps, which eventually merge into ridge and slough formations that narrow into the Shark River that flow into the Gulf of Mexico. Where the Shark River forms the area is lined with marl marshes, and the Big Cypress Swamp is located between the ridge and slough formations and the Gulf of Mexico. To the east the Atlantic Coastal Ridge rises slightly above the Everglades, which is where the major population centers are located|Major landscape types in the Everglades before human action. Source: U.S. Geological Survey]]

The Everglades are dominated by [[Cladium|sawgrass]] in water; this is the titular "River of Grass" popularized by [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas]] in 1947. This river contains a wide variety of plant and animal life. An early American environmentalist named [[Gifford Pinchot]] said of the Everglades, "It is a region so different that it hardly seems to belong to the United States. It is full of the most vivid and most interesting life on land, in the air, and in the water. It is a land of strangeness, separate and apart from the common things we all know so well."&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sawgrass grows in prairies or strands, in between channels of water in a shallow river {{convert|100|mi|km}} long and {{convert|60|mi|km}} wide flowing from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. Some authors refer to the sawgrass and water combination as the "true Everglades" or just "the Glades".&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Draining and development of the Everglades|first drainage attempts in 1905]], the ''sheetflow'', or the wide shallow river starting in Lake Okeechobee, occupied nearly a third of the lower Florida peninsula.&lt;ref name="McCally"/&gt; Though sawgrass remains the main feature of the Everglades, other ecosystems are scattered among the marshes and prairies, and their borders are sometimes imperceptible.

=== Sawgrass marsh ===
Most marshes in the Everglades are dominated by the [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] known as ''[[Cladium]]'', or sawgrass in common terminology.  The sedge is a three-dimensional v-shaped stalk with upward-pointing teeth. Sawgrass thrives in the slowly moving water, but may die if oxygen is unable to reach its roots and is particularly vulnerable to floods immediately after a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p.&amp;nbsp;168.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the sawgrass can grow up to {{convert|6|ft|m}} tall, and directly south of [[Lake Okeechobee]] it has grown to {{convert|10|ft|m}}. Farther south, where the peat is not as rich, it typically grows {{convert|4|ft|m}} tall in patches, as opposed to the prairies of the upper glades.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The hydroperiod for the marsh is usually nine months but can last longer. In shorter hydroperiods, [[marl]] may form instead of peat.&lt;ref&gt;Jewell, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where sawgrass grows densely, few animals or other plants thrive, although [[alligator]]s often choose these locations for nesting. Where there is more room, [[periphyton]] grows, appearing as mats or brown sausage-shaped chunks. Periphyton is predominantly [[algae]], although over 100&amp;nbsp;different [[microorganisms]] help create it.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney,&amp;nbsp;p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larval insects]] and [[amphibians]] are supported by periphyton; these in turn provide food for birds, fish, and reptiles. Periphyton also absorbs [[calcium]] from the water, which creates marl where sawgrass takes root.&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freshwater sloughs ===
Sloughs are channels of free-flowing water in between the sawgrass marshes. Sloughs are deeper than sawgrass marshes, about {{convert|3|ft|m}}, and may stay flooded for at least 11&amp;nbsp;months out of the year if not multiple years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; The peat beds that support sawgrass are slightly elevated and may begin abruptly creating ridges of grass. The borders between these systems are called "ridge-and-slough" landscapes. Aquatic animals such as turtles, young alligators, snakes, and fish live in sloughs and they usually feed on aquatic invertebrates, such as the Florida [[apple snail]].&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants grow here, usually submerged or floating like bladderwort (''[[Utricularia]]''), waterlily (''[[Nymphaeaceae]]''), or spatterdock (''[[Nuphar lutea]]''). Major sloughs in the Everglades system include the [[Shark River (Florida)|Shark River]] Slough draining to Florida Bay, Lostmans Slough bordering The Big Cypress, and [[Taylor Slough]] in the eastern Everglades.

Two kinds of wet prairies thrive in the Everglades: [[marl]] and water-marsh community. Wet prairies are slightly elevated like sawgrass marshes, but contain abundant plant diversity.  Marl prairies are located where marl covers limestone that may protrude as pinnacles or erode into ''solution holes'': depressions formed by the same processes that create [[sinkhole]]s. Solution holes, however, do not meet the water table; they are filled with rain water.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; The surface is covered only three to seven months of the year, but the water is usually just {{convert|4|in|cm}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; Marl is created by layers of periphyton loosely attached to the limestone, and forms a grey or white crumbly mud when it dries. When flooded, the marl can support a variety of water plants, and dwarf cypresses may grow for hundreds of years though not exceed {{convert|10|ft|m}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p.&amp;nbsp;164.&lt;/ref&gt; Solution holes may remain flooded even when the prairies are dry, and they support aquatic invertebrates such as crayfish and snails, as well as larval amphibians which feed young [[Wader|wading birds]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p.&amp;nbsp;163.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the predominant soil is peat, a water-marsh community exists. Its hydroperiod is longer than the marl prairie, although its plants are less diverse. These regions tend to be on the border between sloughs and sawgrass marshes.

Alligators have created an ecological niche in wet prairies; they dig at low spots with their claws and snouts and create ponds free of vegetation that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral to the survival of aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. Alligators feed upon animals that visit the hole.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp.&amp;nbsp;45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands of trees featuring dense temperate or tropical trees are called [[tropical hardwood hammock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt; They may rise between {{convert|1|and|3|ft|m}} above water level in freshwater sloughs, sawgrass prairies, or pineland. These islands illustrate the difficulty of characterizing the climate of the Everglades as tropical or subtropical. Hammocks in the northern portion of the Everglades consist of more temperate plant species, but closer to Florida Bay the trees are tropical and smaller shrubs are more prevalent. Tropical trees like the West Indian mahogany (''[[Swietenia mahagoni]]'') were probably spread by birds carrying seeds from the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name="Lodge"&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt;

These hammocks form on slightly elevated areas unharmed by deep peat fires or limestone plateaus rising several inches above the surrounding peat.  Hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees that grow in very dense clumps, such as southern live oak (''[[Quercus virginiana]]''), gumbo limbo (''[[Bursera simaruba]]''), royal palm (''[[Roystonea]]''), and willow bustic (''[[Dipholis salicifolia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the bases of hammocks sharp saw palmettos (''[[Serenoa repens]]'') flourish, making the hammocks very difficult to penetrate. Water in sloughs flow around the islands creating [[moat]]s. Though some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire, hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover; the moats are therefore essential for protection.&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; Islands vary in size, but most range between {{convert|1|and|10|acre|ha}}; the water slowly flowing around them limits their size and gives them a teardrop appearance from above.&lt;ref&gt;Toops, p.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt; The height of the trees is limited by factors such as frost, lightning, and wind: the majority of trees in hammocks grow no higher than {{convert|55|ft|m}}.

Florida strangler figs (''[[Ficus aurea]]'') are common in hammocks, and find particular ease in rooting at the heads of cabbage palms (''[[Sabal palmetto]]''). After taking root into the ground, they build complex frameworks around the host tree, eventually squeezing out light and nutrients, and essentially taking its place.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of invertebrates including beetles, ants, spiders, and [[tree snail]]s support a food chain that includes frogs, owls and other birds of prey, snakes, rodents, [[bobcat]]s, and [[raccoon]]s. There are more than 50&amp;nbsp;varieties of tree snails in the Everglades; the color patterns and designs unique to single islands may be a result of the isolation of certain hammocks.&lt;ref&gt;Toops, p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical hardwood hammocks in the Everglades have been harvested for lumber, particularly by shipbuilders seeking West Indian mahogany and black ironwood (''[[Krugiodendron ferreum]]''). The largest and most mature of these trees had been removed by the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="Lodge"/&gt; [[Seminole]]s made their villages in hammocks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; they lived in groups of [[chickee]]s numbering half a dozen, with one central chickee for cooking and another for eating. Dugout canoes, cookware, [[still]]s, and sewing machines may still be found in remote locations.&lt;ref&gt;Toops, p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bayheads and willowheads====
Some hammocks are dominated by types of vegetation that grow in relation to the amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called [[humus]], made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (''[[Magnolia virginiana]]'') and others like swamp holly (''[[Ilex decidua]]''), wax myrtle (''[[Myrica cerifera]]''), and cocoplum (''[[Chrysobalanus icaco]]'').&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (''[[Salix caroliniana]]''), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a [[donut]] appearance from above.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flatwoods and the Atlantic Coastal Ridge ==
[[File:South Florida rocklands on Everglades National Park Long Pine Key Nature Trail.jpg|thumb|alt=A color image of a pine rockland ecosystem showing mostly short palmettos and the tall thin trunks of South Florida slash pines|The pine rockland ecosystem is dominated by South Florida [[slash pine]]s and shrubs like [[Serenoa|saw palmettos]].]]

The prairies and sloughs of the Everglades system are bordered by two areas of poorly drained sandy soil on both sides of Lake Okeechobee: the Eastern Flatwoods and the Western Flatwoods just north of Big Cypress Swamp. The predominant ecosystem in the Flatwoods is pine forest, but there are also cypress swamps and sloughs in the Eastern Flatwoods.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along the eastern border of the Everglades is the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, rising {{convert|20|ft|m}} in elevation, and curving to the southwest, gradually decreasing in elevation until it meets Taylor Slough. The Coastal Ridge prevents Everglades water from flowing into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, directing it southwesterly into Florida Bay. The [[South Florida metropolitan area]] is located on a portion of the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, and much of the landscape has changed drastically within the past 100&amp;nbsp;years as a result of urban growth.

=== Pine rockland ===
[[South Florida rocklands#Pine rockland|Pine rocklands]] (also called pinelands) are found on uneven [[limestone]] [[Stratum|substrates]] that contain pinnacles and solution holes. There are three primary locations of pine rocklands: the Miami Ridge, which runs from Miami into Long Pine Key near the main entrance of [[Everglades National Park]]; the lower Florida Keys; and the Big Cypress Swamp.&lt;ref&gt;Jewell, p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant feature of the pine rockland ecosystem is the South Florida slash pine ([[Slash Pine|''Pinus elliotti'' var ''densa'']]; also called Dade County pine) that reaches a height of {{convert|22|ft|m}}. Pine rockland communities require fire for maintenance; they have adapted to promote and resist fire at the same time.&lt;ref name="fwspine"&gt;U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. "[http://www.fws.gov/southeast/vbpdfs/commun/pr.pdf South Florida Multi-Species Recovery Plan: Pine rockland]" (PDF), Retrieved May 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These communities are located in the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod, although some floors may have flooded solution holes or puddles for a few months at a time. The sandy floor of the pine rocklands is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; A period without significant fire can turn pineland into hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines.&lt;ref name="usgsfire"&gt;

The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are herbs, of which two dozen species exist. These plants contain [[tuber]]s and other mechanisms allowing for quick sprouts after charring.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildlife in pine rockland communities is diverse. In some forests, 15&amp;nbsp;species of birds can be found. Common among them are the [[pine warbler]] (''Dendroica pinus''), the [[red-bellied woodpecker]] (''Melanerpes carolinus''), and the [[eastern meadowlark]] (''Sturnella magna''). More than 20&amp;nbsp;species of reptiles and amphibians have been noted, such as the [[green anole]] (''Anolis carolinensis''), [[southern leopard frog]] (''Rana sphenocephala''), and southern black racer (''[[Coluber constrictor priapus]]''). Mammals such as the [[critically endangered]] [[Florida panther]] (''Puma concolor coryi''), [[American black bearFlorida black bear ]](''Ursus americanus floridanus''), and several types of bats also live in the pine rocklands.&lt;ref name="fwspine"/&gt;

Before urban development of the South Florida region, pine rocklands covered around {{convert|161660|acre|km2}} in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]. Pine forests were extensively cleared by urban developers and the lumber industry in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="fwspine"/&gt; Within Everglades National Park, {{convert|19840|acre|km2}} of pine rockland communities are protected, but outside the park, {{convert|1780|acre|km2}} of pine forests remain as of 1990, averaging {{convert|12.1|acre|km2}} in size.&lt;ref name="fwspine"/&gt;  Dade County pine has a remarkable longevity and has proven to be [[termite]]-resistant, though dense enough to make driving nails difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 they were protected by a county [[Local ordinance|ordinance]], after many pine areas had been depleted. A misunderstanding of fire's role also played a part in the disappearance of pine forests, as natural fires were put out and pine rocklands transitioned into hardwood hammocks.&lt;ref name="fwspine"/&gt; Today [[prescribed fire]]s occur in Everglades National Park in pine rocklands every three to seven years.

== The Big Cypress ==
West of the sawgrass prairies and sloughs lies the Big Cypress Swamp, commonly called "The Big Cypress", referring to its size rather than the height or diameter of its trees. It takes up the majority of [[Collier County, Florida|Collier County]]; at its most limited measurement, the swamp measures {{convert|1200|sqmi|km2}}, but its hydrological boundary is nearly twice as large.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Cypress is slightly elevated at {{convert|22|ft|m}} at its highest point and slopes gradually to the coastline for approximately {{convert|35|mi|km}}. Because the defining feature of The Big Cypress is the abundance of trees it is considered a swamp, rather than a marsh where grass is the main characteristic.

The basin for The Big Cypress receives on average {{convert|55|in|cm}} of water in the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of The Big Cypress sits atop a bedrock covered by a thin layer of limestone that contains [[quartz]], creating a sandy soil that hosts a variety of vegetation.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; The majority of trees are bald cypress (''[[Taxodium distichum]]'') and not true cypresses (''[[Cupressaceae]]''). Cypresses are conifers that are uniquely adapted to thrive in flooded conditions, with buttressed trunks and root projections that protrude out of the water, called "knees".&lt;ref&gt;Jewell, p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cypress trees in the area can live for hundreds of years; some giants grow to {{convert|130|ft|m}} and are 500&amp;nbsp;years old. Still, they may be only seventh- or eighth-generation cypresses. Few massive trees survived the logging operations that took place in the 1930s and 1940s. As a result, much of The Big Cypress is protected by various federal or state agencies that include [[Big Cypress National Preserve]], [[Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary]], [[Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve]] and two Indian reservations.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cypress head ===
[[Image:Big cypress.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A color photograph of a pond surrounded by cypress trees in standing water, featuring their flared trunks at the bottom and some water plants bordering the pond in the foreground|A pond in The Big Cypress]]

Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as "heads", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt; They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, pp.&amp;nbsp;31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (''[[Acer rubrum]]''), swamp bay (''[[Persea palustris]]''), and pop ash (''[[Fraxinus caroliniana]]''). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest.

Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as [[orchid]]s, [[bromeliad]]s, and [[fern]]s thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (''[[Mycteria americana]]'') nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100&amp;nbsp;years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to [[Restoration of the Everglades|controlled water]]. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000&amp;nbsp;wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, pp.&amp;nbsp;30–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mangroves and coastal prairie ==
[[File:Everglades mangroves Buttonwood Canal.JPG|thumb|Red [[mangrove]] trees bordering a canal in the Everglades near Flamingo]]

Water from Lake Okeechobee and The Big Cypress eventually flows to the ocean. At a transitional zone where fresh water meets salt water, [[mangrove]] trees thrive, adapted as they are to both kinds of water. This [[brackish]] mixture of water and mangrove systems, crisscrossed by hundreds of [[tidal creek]]s, harbors a very productive ecosystem. The depth of these zones is dependent on how much water flows from the Everglades. In the wet season, fresh water pours into Florida Bay and sawgrass appears near the coastline. In dryer years, salt water creeps inland to the coastal prairie, an ecosystem that buffers the freshwater marshes by absorbing sea water. Mangrove trees grow in fresh water ecosystems when the salt water flows far enough inland.&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Everglades have the most extensive contiguous system of mangroves in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Katherisen, K. (2001). "Biology of Mangroves and Mangrove Ecosystems", ''Advances in Marine Biology'', Alan J. Southward (ed.) '''40''', pp.&amp;nbsp;18–251. {{ISBN|978-0-12-026140-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The mangrove forests of the [[Ten Thousand Islands]] cover almost {{convert|200000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name="Ripple"&gt;Ripple, p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mangroves ===
Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]''), black (''[[Avicennia germinans]]''), and white (''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]''), although all are from different families.&lt;ref&gt;Jewell, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt; All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p.&amp;nbsp;286.&lt;/ref&gt; Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and [[storm surge]]s.

The estuaries act as [[fisheries]] for fry and nurseries for [[crustacean]]s. Shrimp, [[oyster]]s, crabs, [[whelk]]s, [[cockle (bivalve)|cockles]], and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial [[Atlantic horseshoe crab|horseshoe crabs]] (''Limulus polyphemus''). The region supports a $59&amp;nbsp;million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (''[[Farfantepenaeus duorarum]]'') industry, and a $22&amp;nbsp;million-a-year [[Florida stone cran|stone crab]] (''Menippe mercenaria'') industry.&lt;ref&gt;

The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called [[propagule]]s, are full [[embryo]]s and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, pp.&amp;nbsp;288–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as [[roseate spoonbill]]s (''Platalea ajaja''), [[egret]]s, and [[tricolored heron]]s (''Egretta tricolor'') use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, pp.&amp;nbsp;295–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Shorebirds like [[Rallidae|rails]], [[tern]]s and [[gull]]s; diving birds such as [[pelican]]s and [[grebe]]s; and [[birds of prey]] such as [[osprey]]s, [[hawk]]s and [[vulture]]s are among the more than 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.

== Florida Bay ==
[[Image:Florida Bay at Flamingo.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the greenish blue water of Florida Bay, featuring a large Sabal palm to the left and a mangrove island in the distance|A clump of mangroves in the distance, [[Florida Bay]] at [[Flamingo, Florida|Flamingo]]]]

Because much of the coast and inner estuaries are built by mangroves—and there is no border between the coastal marshes and the bay—the ecosystems in [[Florida Bay]] are considered part of the Everglades. More than {{convert|800|sqmi|km2}} of Florida Bay is protected by [[Everglades National Park]], representing the largest body of water in the park boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;

 | accessdate = 2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately one hundred [[cay|keys]] in Florida Bay, many of which are mangrove forests.&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; Larger islands may be taken over by hardwood hammocks. The outer rims of the Ten Thousand Islands and [[Cape Sable]] share characteristics of the intertwining saltwater bays and fresh water marshes.

The fresh water entering Florida Bay from the Everglades creates ideal conditions for vast beds of [[seagrass|turtle grass]] and algae formations that foster animal life in the bay. [[Sea turtle]]s and [[manatee]]s (''Trichechus manatus latirostris'') eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, clams, and other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic [[plankton]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, pp.&amp;nbsp;313–316.&lt;/ref&gt; Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The [[Calusa]] Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, due to the lack of dense rock with which to make tools. They used the horse conch (''[[Triplofusus papillosus]]''), left-handed whelk (''[[Sinistrofulgur]]''), and the Florida crown conch (''[[Melongena corona]]'') as drinking vessels, picks, hammers, knives and awls.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, pp.&amp;nbsp;93—103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea grasses stabilize sea beds and protect shorelines from erosion by absorbing energy from waves. Shrimp, [[spiny lobster]]s, and [[sea urchin]]s live in and among the grasses and feed on [[phytoplankton]]; they in turn feed larger predators such as [[shark]]s, [[Rajiformes|rays]], [[barracuda]], and [[king mackerel]] (''Scomberomorus cavalla'').&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, pp.&amp;nbsp;328–330.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to shallow water and abundant sunlight, Florida Bay hosts communities of [[coral reef]]s and [[sponge]]s, although the majority of the state's reefs are closer to the [[Florida Keys]].&lt;ref&gt;Jewell, p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt; Everglades keys that foster mangroves also support nurseries for wading birds such as the [[Great blue heron]] (''Ardea herodias''), which was almost wiped out in the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]] (only 146 were counted afterward).&lt;ref&gt;Toops, p.&amp;nbsp;88.&lt;/ref&gt; After recovering to number more than 2,000, they were further endangered by [[Hurricane Donna]] in 1960, which decreased their numbers by 35 to 40&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea floor patterns of Florida Bay are formed by currents and winds. However, since 1932, sea levels have been rising at a rate of {{convert|1|ft|m}} per 100&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt; Though mangroves serve to build and stabilize the coastline, seas may be rising more rapidly than the trees are able to build.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
Ecosystems in the Everglades have been described as both fragile and resilient.&lt;ref name="toops92"&gt;Toops, p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Michael Grunwald wrote about the observations of the Everglades' first American visitors: "If the Grand Canyon was a breathtaking painting, the Everglades was a complex drama, and everything in it had a role."&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 11,000&amp;nbsp;species of seed-bearing plants and 400&amp;nbsp;species of land or water vertebrates live in the Everglades, but slight variations in water levels affect many organisms and reshape land formations. The health and productivity of any ecosystem relies on the number of species present: the loss of one species weakens the entire ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p.&amp;nbsp;383.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Florida apple snails (''[[Ampullariidae|Pomacea paludosa]]'')  are an amphibious fresh water mollusk.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt; They have a single gill and lung, and live on stalks of sawgrass in water depths no more than {{convert|20|in|cm}}. They are the primary food of the endangered [[snail kite]] (''Rostrhamus sociabilis'') and [[limpkin]] (''Aramus guarauna'') as well as the raccoon, otter, and young alligator. Apple snails lay their eggs on sawgrass stalks about {{convert|6|in|cm}} above the water line, and they are intolerant of being submerged for long periods of time. When the eggs hatch, young snails must enter the water quickly or face death. When water levels are too low or rise too quickly while snail eggs are developing, apple snails do not flourish, affecting the many reptiles, mammals, and birds that feed on them.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;136.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the ecology of [[trophic dynamics]], or food chains, the 174&amp;nbsp;species of invertebrates play a vital role in the Everglades.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;140.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crayfish]], insects, scorpions, and other invertebrates also support a web of animals.

The group of animals most integral to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places in the Everglades stay submerged from one year to the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal community as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also play an important role in the food chain. [[Tadpole]]s spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt;

These smaller animals support communities of larger animals, including 70&amp;nbsp;species of land birds that breed within the Everglades, and 120&amp;nbsp;water birds, of which 43 breed in the area. Many of these birds go on to migrate through the West Indies and North America.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;183–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Several dozen species of mammals also thrive in the region, from tiny bats and shrews to midsize [[raccoon]]s (''Procyon lotor''), [[North American river otter|otter]]s (''Lontra canadensis''), [[Virginia opossum|opossum]]s (''Didelphis virginiana''), and [[fox]]es. The largest include [[white tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), the Florida black bear, and the Florida panther.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;175–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although slight changes in water level affect many species, the system as a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the diversity of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the [[Restoration of the Everglades#Invasive species|introduction of exotic species]], and rapid [[global warming]]. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but [[wood stork]]s and [[Cape Sable seaside sparrow]]s (''Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis'') do well in dryer circumstances.&lt;ref name="toops92"/&gt;

=== Development ===
{{main|Draining and development of the Everglades|Restoration of the Everglades}}

People have lived in the Everglades region for thousands of years. Within the past 100&amp;nbsp;years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades.&lt;ref&gt;Light, Stephen, Dineed, J. Walter, "Water Control in the Everglades: A Historical Perspective", in ''Everglades: The Ecosystem and its Restoration'', Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), Delray Beach, Fla.: St. Lucie Press. {{ISBN|0-9634030-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Florida metropolitan area]] grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 1: Background and understanding |work=The Governor's Commission for a Sustainable South Florida |publisher=State of Florida |date=October 1, 1995 |url=http://dlis.dos.state.fl.us/fgils/agencies/sust/intro.html |accessdate=2008-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518165911/http://dlis.dos.state.fl.us/fgils/agencies/sust/intro.html |archivedate=May 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre-drainage conditions as possible.

=== Invasive species ===
{{main|List of invasive species in the Everglades|Burmese pythons in Florida}}

Humans have also adversely impacted the ecology of the Everglades by introducing numerous [[invasive species]], which may prey on or compete with native species. A spectacular and particularly damaging example of this phenomenon is the recent proliferation of the [[Burmese python]] in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995,&lt;ref name = "NatGeo_2005"&gt;Mott, Maryann (October 28, 2005).

'''Gulf Stream Turbines LLC''' is start up company that is trying to create a renewable energy source using the [[Gulf Stream]] current. The Gulf Stream, which is produced by the earth’s rotation, contains an enormous amount [[hydrokinetic energy]].  To tap into this immense source of renewable energy to produce electricity Gulf Stream Turbines plan on creating submersible power plants that can operate for extremely long periods without servicing.  The Gulf Stream Turbine can do this because of its failure-proof design that depends on the [[laws of physics]] and has few moving parts.

==Technology==
The Gulf Stream Turbine relies on the relative locations of its centers of [[buoyancy]] and gravity to obtain its great stability and on a unique method of leveraging opposing forces to balance the lifting forces produced by the hydrofoils against the downward vector forces produced by the horizontal drag acting through the downward-angled anchor line.  Because of their simplicity and lack of moving parts, they can generate electricity for extremely long periods without servicing.

The patents cover a self-supporting structure that allows the [[turbines]] to be positioned at those depths where the current can generate electricity at near the turbines’ design capacities.  The actual conversion of the water’s kinetic energy into electricity utilizes the same technologies that are used by the wind-turbine industry.  Unlike the wind turbines, the Gulf Stream Turbines will have very high capacity factors, extremely low O&amp;M costs, and be able to produce usable power 24-7.

==Benefits==

Every kilowatt-hour of electricity generated with renewable energy can replace the same amount of electricity that is generated with a fossil fuel.  If the electricity generated with a 1.2-MW Gulf Stream Turbine were to replace that generated by a coal-fired plant, the [[CO2 emissions]] would be cut by about 13,000 tons.  If that electricity replaced that generated by a gas-fired turbine, those emissions would be reduced by about 5,900 tons.

During off-peak periods, the electricity produced by the Gulf Stream Turbines can replace the fossil-fuel-produced electricity, produce hydrogen for fuel-cell-powered cars, and recharge the batteries of plug-in hybrids and electric cars – all of which would further reduce the CO2 emissions.      
It is impossible to predict the additional incomes that might result from the sale of the carbon permits because the prices of those permits will be determined by auction and the supply will be controlled by those government officials administering the program.

A number of economists have estimated that the carbon prices will probably range between $20 and $40 per ton.  With a carbon offset commodity futures price of $30 a ton, the owners of a 1.2-MW Gulf Stream Turbine could potentially receive an additional income of $390,000 per year – based on the 13,000 tons of CO2 that would be emitted by coal-fired plants producing that same amount of electricity.

With a wholesale electricity price of 10 cents per kWh, the revenues from the sale of the electricity and the PTC subsidy would be $1,081,897.  Adding the $390,000 from the sale of the carbon permits would increase it to $1,471,897.  That $1,471,897 would produce a return of 61.3% on an investment of $2.4 million ($2,000/kW) and of 49% on an investment of $3 million ($2,500/kW)

[[File:Dionysos Horai Louvre MR720.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Dionysus]] leading the Horae ([[Neo-Attic]] [[Roman sculpture|Roman relief]], 1st century)]]
In [[Greek mythology]] the '''Horae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɔː|r|iː}}) or '''Horai''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɔː|r|aɪ}}) or '''Hours''' ({{lang-el|Ὧραι}}, ''Hōrai'', {{IPA-el|hɔ̂ːraj|pron}}, "Seasons") were the [[goddess]]es of the seasons and the natural portions of time.

== Etymology ==
The word "Horae" comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] stem *''Hioh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-r-'' "year."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1681.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
[[File:Edward John Poynter - Horae Serenae (detail), 1894.jpg|thumb|261x261px|A detail of ''Horae Serenae'' by [[Edward Poynter]] (1894)|right]]They were originally the personifications of nature in its different seasonal aspects, but in later times they were regarded as  goddesses of order in general and natural justice. "They bring and bestow ripeness, they come and go in accordance with the firm law of the periodicities of nature and of life",  [[Karl Kerenyi]] observed: "''Hora'' means 'the correct moment'."&lt;ref&gt;References to the Horai in classical sources are credited in Karl Kerenyi's synthesis of all the mythology, ''The Gods of the Greeks'' 1951, pp 101f and passim (index, "Horai")&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, they guarded the gates of Olympus, promoted the fertility of the earth, and rallied the stars and constellations.

The course of the seasons was also symbolically described as the dance of the Horae, and they were accordingly given the attributes of spring flowers, fragrance and graceful freshness. For example, in Hesiod's ''[[Works and Days]]'', the fair-haired ''Horai'', together with the [[Charites]] and [[Peitho]] crown [[Pandora]]—she of "all gifts"—with garlands of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;''Works and Days'' lines 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Aphrodite, emerging from the sea and coming ashore at [[Cyprus]], is dressed and adorned by the ''Horai'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Homeric Hymn]] 6.5-13.&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to a surviving fragment of the epic ''[[Cypria]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cypria'', fr. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Aphrodite wore clothing made for her by the Charites and Horai, dyed with spring flowers, such as the ''Horai'' themselves wear.{{Greek myth (personified)}}

== Names and numbers ==
The number of Horae varied according to different sources, but was most commonly three: either the trio of '''Thallo''', '''Auxo''' and '''Carpo''' (goddesses of the order of nature) or '''[[Eunomia (goddess)|Eunomia]]''' (goddess of good order and lawful conduct) and her sisters '''[[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]''' (goddess of Justice) and '''[[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]]''' (goddess of Peace).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/HoraEunomia.html Eunomia]. [[Theoi Project]]. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== The earlier Argive Horae ===
In [[Argos]], two Horae, rather than three, were recognised presumably  winter and summer: '''[[Auxesia]]''' (possibly another name for Auxo) and '''[[Damia (goddess)|Damia]]''' (possibly another name for Carpo).

In late [[euhemerism|euhemerist]] interpretations, they were seen as Cretan maidens who were worshipped as goddesses after they had been wrongfully stoned to death.

=== The classical Horae triads ===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2015}}  
The earliest written mention of ''Horai'' is in the ''[[Iliad]]'' where they appear as keepers of [[Zeus]]'s cloud gates.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 5. 749-51.&lt;/ref&gt; "Hardly any traces of that function are found in the subsequent tradition," [[Karl Galinsky]] remarked in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Galinsky, "Venus, Polysemy, and the Ara Pacis Augustae" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''96'''.3 (July 1992:457-475) p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; They were daughters of [[Zeus]] and [[Themis]], half-sisters to the [[Moirai]].&lt;ref&gt;G.M.A. Hanfmann, ''The Seasons Sarcophagus at Dumbarton Oaks'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts) 1951; V. Machaira, in ''[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae]]'' '''5'''.1 (1990), p 502f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horai are mentioned in two aspects in [[Hesiod]] and the [[Homeric Hymns]]:
* in one variant emphasizing their fruitful aspect, Thallo, Auxo, and Carpo—the goddesses of the three seasons the Greeks recognized: spring, summer and autumn—were worshipped primarily amongst rural farmers throughout Greece;
* in the other variant, emphasising the "right order" aspect of the Horai, Hesiod says that Zeus wedded "bright [[Themis]]" who bore Diké, Eunomia, and Eirene, who were law-and-order goddesses that maintained the stability of society; they were worshipped primarily in the cities of [[Athens]], [[Argos]] and [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].

==== First triad ====
Of the first, more familiar, triad associated with [[Aphrodite]] and Zeus is their origins as emblems of times of life, growth (and the classical three seasons of year):
{{Wiktionary|Thallo|Auxo|Carpo}}
* '''Thallo''' (Θαλλώ, literally "The one who brings blossoms"; or '''[[Flora (mythology)|Flora]]''' for Romans) or '''Thalatte''' was the goddess of [[spring (season)|spring]], buds and blooms, a protector of youth.
* '''Auxo''' (Αὐξώ. "Increaser" as in plant growth) or '''Auxesia''' was worshipped (alongside [[Hegemone]]) in [[Athens]] as one of their two [[Charites]], Auxo was the Charis of spring and Hegemone was the Charis of autumn. One of the Horae, and the goddess and personification of the season of [[summer]]; she is the protector of vegetation and plants, and growth and fertility.
* '''Carpo''' (Καρπώ), '''Carpho''' or '''Xarpo''' (not to be mistaken with [[Karpos]]) was the one who brings food (though [[Robert Graves]] in ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955) translates this name as "withering") and was in charge of [[autumn]], [[ripening]], and [[harvest]]ing, as well as guarding the way to [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]] and letting back the clouds surrounding the mountain if one of the gods left. She was an attendant to [[Persephone]], [[Aphrodite]] and [[Hera]], and was also associated with [[Dionysus]], [[Apollo]] and [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].

At Athens, two Horae; Thallo (the Hora of spring) and Carpo (the Hora of autumn), also appear in rites of [[Attica]] noted by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 9.35.2. Compare [[Hyginus]], ''Fabula'' 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thallo, Auxo and Carpo are often accompanied by [[Chione (daughter of Boreas)|Chione]], a daughter of [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] (the god/personification of the [[North wind|North Wind]]) and [[Orithyia|Orithyia/Oreithyia]] (originally a mortal princess, who was later [[Deifying|deifyied]] as a goddess of cold mountain winds), and the goddess/personification of [[snow]] and [[winter]].  Along with Chione, Thallo, Auxo and Carpo were a part of the entourage of the goddess of the turn of the seasons, [[Persephone]].[[File:Jacob Jordaens- Al·legoria de la Pau.jpg|thumb|Allegory of peace and happiness of the state. In this picture we can see Dike (the justice), Eunomia (order) and, in the center, Eirene (the Peace)|279x279px]]

==== Second triad ====
Of the second triad associated to Themis and Zeus for law and order:
* '''[[Dike (mythology)|Diké]]''' (Δίκη, "Justice"; '''[[Iustitia]]''' for Romans) was the goddess of moral justice: she ruled over human justice, as her mother [[Themis]] ruled over divine justice. The [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphisation]] of Diké as an ever-young woman dwelling in the cities of men was so ancient and strong that in the 3rd century BCE [[Aratus]] in ''[[Aratus|Phaenomena]]'' 96 asserted that she was born a mortal and that, though Zeus placed her on earth to keep mankind just, he quickly learned this was impossible and placed her next to him on Olympus, as the Greek astronomical/astrological constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|The Maiden]].
* '''[[Eunomia (goddess)|Eunomia]]''' (Εὐνομία, "Order", governance according to good laws) was the goddess of law and legislation. The same or a different goddess may have been a daughter of [[Hermes]] and [[Aphrodite]].
* '''[[Eirene (Greek goddess)|Eirene]]''' or '''Irene''' (Εἰρήνη. "Peace"; the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent was '''[[Pax (mythology)|Pax]]'''), was the personification of peace and wealth, and was depicted in art as a beautiful young woman carrying a [[cornucopia]], [[scepter]] and a torch or [[rhyton]].

==== Third triad ====
[[Hyginus]] (''Fabulae'' 183) identifies a third set of Horae:
* '''[[Pherusa]]''' (Substance, farm estates),
* '''[[Euporie]]''' or '''Euporia''' (Abundance), and
* '''Orthosie''' or '''Orthosia''' (Prosperity).

=== The Four Seasons ===
[[Nonnus]] in his ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' mentions a distinct set of four Horae, the daughters of [[Helios]]. [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] also attributes the Horae as the daughters of Helios and [[Selene]], and describes them as the four handmaidens of [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, "SELENE", pp. 970–971; Quintus Smyrnaeus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K7qQPTMiKaEC&amp;pg=PA442 10.336 ff. pp. 442&amp;ndash;443]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek words for the four seasons of year:
* '''Eiar''' (Spring),
* '''Theros''' (Summer),
* '''Phthinoporon''' (Autumn), and
* '''Cheimon''' (Winter).

=== The Hours ===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - The Hours, 1882.jpg|thumb|''The Hours'' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (1882)|293x293px]]
Finally, a quite separate suite of Horae personified the twelve hours (originally only ten), as tutelary goddesses of the times of day. The hours run from just before sunrise to just after sunset, thus winter hours are short, summer hours are long:

==== The nine Hours ====
According to [[Hyginus]], the list is only of nine, borrowed from the three classical triads alternated:
* '''Auco''', or perhaps '''Auxo''' (Growth, from the 1st triad),
* '''Eunomia''' (Order, from the 2nd triad),
* '''Pherusa''' (Substance, from the 3rd triad),
* '''Carpo''' (Fruit, from the 1st triad),
* '''Diké''' (Justice, from the 2nd triad),
* '''Euporie''' or '''Euporia''' (Abundance, from the 3rd triad),
* '''Eirene''' or '''Irene''' (Peace, from the 2nd triad),
* '''Orthosie''' or '''Orthosia''' (Prosperity, from the 3rd triad) and
* '''Thallo''' (Flora, from the 1st triad).&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus Fabulae 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The ten or twelve Hours ====
[[File:Kersting - Apollo with the Hours.jpg|thumb|200px|''Apollo with the Hours'' by [[Georg Friedrich Kersting]] (1822)]]
This last distinct set of ten or twelve Hours is much less known:
* '''Auge''', first light (initially not part of the set),
* '''Anatolê''' or '''Anatolia''', sunrise,
* '''Mousikê''' or '''Musica''', the morning hour of music and study,
* '''Gymnastikê''', '''Gymnastica''' or '''Gymnasia''', the morning hour of education, training, gymnastics/exercise,
* '''[[Nymph]]ê''' or '''Nympha''', the morning hour of ablutions (bathing, washing),
* '''Mesembria''', noon,
* '''Sponde''', [[libation]]s poured after lunch,
* '''Elete''', prayer, the first of the afternoon work hours,
* '''Aktê''', '''Acte''' or '''Cypris''', eating and pleasure, the second of the afternoon work hours,
* '''[[Hesperides|Hesperis]]''', end of the afternoon work hours, start of evening,
* '''Dysis''', sunset,
* '''Arktos''' or '''Arctus''', night sky, constellation (initially not part of the set).

An '''hydrological transport model''' is a [[mathematical model]] used to simulate river or [[stream flow]] and calculate [[water quality]] parameters. These models generally came into use in the 1960s and 1970s when demand for numerical forecasting of water quality was driven by [[environmental legislation]], and at a similar time widespread access to significant computer power became available. Much of the original model development took place in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], but today these models are refined and used worldwide.

There are dozens of different transport models that can be generally grouped by [[water pollution|pollutants]] addressed, complexity of pollutant sources, whether the model is steady state or dynamic, and time period modeled. Another important designation is whether the model is distributed (i.e. capable of predicting multiple points within a river) or lumped. In a basic model, for example, only one pollutant might be addressed from a simple point discharge into the [[receiving water]]s. In the most complex of models, various [[line source]] inputs from [[surface runoff]] might be added to multiple [[Point source (pollution)|point source]]s, treating a variety of [[chemical]]s plus [[sediment]] in a dynamic environment including vertical river stratification and interactions of pollutants with in-stream [[biota (ecology)|biota]]. In addition [[Drainage basin|watershed]] [[groundwater]] may also be included. The model is termed "physically based" if its parameters can be measured in the field.

Often models have separate modules to address individual steps in the simulation process. The most common module is a [[subroutine]] for calculation of surface runoff, allowing variation in [[land use]] type, [[topography]], [[soil]] type, [[vegetation|vegetative cover]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and land management practice (such as the application rate of a [[fertilizer]]). The concept of hydrological modeling can be extended to other environments such as the [[ocean]]s, but most commonly (and in this article) the subject of a river watershed is generally implied.

==History==

In 1850, T. J. Mulvany was probably the first investigator to use mathematical modeling in a [[stream hydrology]] context, although there was no chemistry involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mulvany | first1 = T.J. | year = 1850 | title = On the use of self registering rain and flow gauges | url = | journal = [[Proc. Institute Civ. Eng.]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1892 M.E. Imbeau had conceived an [[event model]] to relate runoff to peak rainfall, again still with no chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Imbeau, (1892) ''La Durance: Regime. Crues et inundations'', ''Ann. Ponts Chausses Mem. Doc. Ser.'' 3(I) 5-18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E. Horton]]’s seminal work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = R.E. | year = 1933 | title = The role of infiltration on the hydrologic cycle | url = | journal = Trans. Am. Geophys. Union | volume = 145 | issue = | pages = 446–460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[surface runoff]] along with his coupling of quantitative treatment of erosion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = R.E. | year = 1945 | title = Erosional development of streams and their drainage basins: Hydrological approach to quantitative geomorphology | url = | journal = [[Bull.

==Types==

===Physically based models===

Physically based models (sometimes known as deterministic, comprehensive or process-based models) try to represent the physical processes observed in the real world. Typically, such models contain representations of surface runoff, subsurface flow, evapotranspiration, and channel flow, but they can be far more complicated. "Large scale simulation experiments were begun by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1953 for reservoir management on the main stem of the Missouri River". This,&lt;ref&gt;''Report on use of electronic computers for integrating reservoir operations'', vol.1 DATAmatic Corporation technical reports, prepared in cooperation with Raytheon Manufacturing Company for the Missouri River Division, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, January, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; and other early work that dealt with the River Nile&lt;ref&gt;M.P.Barnett, ''Comment on the Nile Valley Calculations'', Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, vol. 19, 223, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.A.W. Morrice and W.N. Allan, ''Planning for the ultimate hydraulic development of the Nile Valley'', Proceedings of the Institute of Civil Engineers, 14, 101, 1959,&lt;/ref&gt; and the Columbia River&lt;ref&gt;F.S. Brown, ''Water Resource Development -- Columbia River Basin'', in ''Report of Meeting of Columbia Basin Inter-Agency Committee, Portland, OR, Dec. 1958&lt;/ref&gt; are discussed, in a wider context, in a book published by the Harvard Water Resources Seminar, that contains the sentence just quoted.&lt;ref&gt;D.F. Manzer and M.P. Barnett, ''Analysis by Simulation: Programming techniques for a High-Speed Digital Computer'', in Arthur Maas ''et al'', ''Design of Water Resource Systems'', pp. 324--390, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early model that integrated many submodels for basin chemical hydrology was the Stanford Watershed Model (SWM).&lt;ref&gt;N.H. Crawford and R.K. Linsley. ''Digital simulation in hydrology: Stanford Watershed Model IV'', Technical Report No.39 [[Stanford University]], Palo Alto, Ca. (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; The SWMM ([[Storm Water Management Model]]), the HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program - FORTRAN) and other modern [[United States|American]] derivatives are successors to this early work.

In Europe a favoured comprehensive model is the Système Hydrologique Européen (SHE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = P.E.O'Connell | last2 = Bathurst | first2 = J.C. | last3 = Cunge | first3 = J.A. | last4 = Rasmussen | first4 = J. | year = 1986 | title = An Introduction to the European System: Systeme Hydrologique Europeen (SHE) | url = | journal = [[Journal of Hydrology]] | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 61–77 | doi=10.1016/0022-1694(86)90115-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vijay P. Singh,, ''Computer Models of Watershed Hydrology, Water Resource Publications'', pgs. 563-594 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; which has been succeeded by [[MIKE SHE]] and [[SHETRAN]]. [[MIKE SHE]] is a watershed-scale physically based, spatially distributed model for water flow and [[sediment transport]]. Flow and transport processes are represented by either finite difference representations of partial [[differential equation]]s or by derived empirical equations. The following principal submodels are involved:

:* [[Evapotranspiration]]: [[Penman-Monteith]] formalism
:* Erosion: Detachment equations for raindrop and overland flow
:* Overland and [[Channel (geography)|Channel]] Flow: Saint-Venant equations of continuity and [[momentum]]
:* Overland Flow [[Sediment]] Transport: 2D total sediment load conservation equation
:* Unsaturated Flow: [[Richards equation]]
:* Saturated Flow: [[Darcy's law]] and the [[conservation of mass|mass conservation]] of 2D laminar flow
:* Channel Sediment Transport 1D mass conservation equation.

This model can analyze effects of [[land use]] and [[climate change]]s upon in-stream water quality, with consideration of [[groundwater]] interactions.

Worldwide a number of basin models have been developed, among them RORB ([[Australia]]), Xinanjiang ([[China]]), Tank model ([[Japan]]), ARNO ([[Italy]]), TOPMODEL ([[Europe]]), UBC ([[Canada]]) and [[HBV hydrology model|HBV]] ([[Scandinavia]]), MOHID Land ([[Portugal]]). However, not all of these models have a chemistry component. Generally speaking, SWM, SHE and TOPMODEL have the most comprehensive stream chemistry treatment and have evolved to accommodate the latest data sources including [[remote sensing]] and [[geographic information system]] data.

In the United States, the Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center in conjunction with a researchers at a number of universities have developed the Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis [[GSSHA]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Downer, C.W., and F.L. Ogden, 2006, Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) User's Manual, Version 1.43 for Watershed Modeling System 6.1, System Wide Water Resources Program, Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center, ERDC/CHL SR-06-1, 207 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Downer | first1 = C.W. | last2 = Ogden | first2 = F.L. | year = 2004 | title = GSSHA: A model for simulating diverse streamflow generating processes | url = | journal = J. Hydrol. Engrg | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 161–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downer, C.W., F.L. Ogden, J. M. Niedzialek, and S. Liu, 2006, Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) Model: A Model for Simulating Diverse Streamflow Producing Processes, pp.&amp;nbsp;131–159, in Watershed Models, V.P. Singh, and D. Frevert, eds., Taylor and Francis Group, CRC Press, 637 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[GSSHA]] is widely used in the U.S. for research and analysis by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts and larger consulting companies to compute flow, water levels, distributed erosion, and sediment delivery in complex [[engineering]] designs. A distributed nutrient and contaminant fate and transport component is undergoing testing. [[GSSHA]] input/output processing and interface with [[GIS]] is facilitated by the Watershed Modeling System (WMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaveo.com/wms|publisher=[[Aquaveo]]|title=Watershed Modeling System|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model used in the United States and worldwide is [[Vflo|V''flo'']], a physics-based distributed hydrologic model developed by Vieux &amp; Associates, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vieuxinc.com Vieuxinc.com]&lt;/ref&gt; V''flo'' employs radar rainfall and GIS data to compute spatially distributed overland flow and channel flow. Evapotranspiration, inundation, infiltration, and snowmelt modeling capabilities are included. Applications include civil infrastructure operations and maintenance, stormwater prediction and emergency management, soil moisture monitoring, land use planning, water quality monitoring, and others.

===Stochastic models===

These models based on data are [[Black box (systems)|black box]] systems, using mathematical and statistical concepts to link a certain input (for instance [[rainfall]]) to the model output (for instance [[Surface runoff|runoff]]). Commonly used techniques are [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[transfer function]]s, [[neural networks]] and [[system identification]]. These models are known as stochastic hydrology models. Data based models have been used within hydrology to simulate the rainfall-runoff relationship, represent the impacts of [[antecedent moisture]] and perform real-time control on systems.

==Model components==

===Surface runoff modelling===

[[Image:ColumbiarivergorgeJRH.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Columbia River]], which has [[surface runoff]] from [[agriculture]] and [[logging]]]]

A key component of a hydrological transport model is the [[surface runoff]] element, which allows assessment of sediment, [[fertilizer]], [[pesticide]] and other chemical contaminants. Building on the work of Horton, the unit hydrograph theory was developed by Dooge in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;J.C.I. Dooge, ''Parameterization of hydrologic processes'', JSC Study Conference on Land Surface Processes in Atmospheric General Circulation Models, 243-284 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; It required the presence of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and kindred other national legislation to provide the impetus to integrate water chemistry to hydrology model protocols. In the early 1970s the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) began sponsoring a series of water quality models in response to the [[Clean Water Act]]. An example of these efforts was developed at the Southeast Water Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, Leda Patmore, Gary Latshaw, Harry Seidman et al. ''Computer modeling of pesticide transport in soil for five instrumented watersheds'', U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Southeast Water Laboratory, Athens, Ga. by [[ESL Inc.]], Sunnyvale, California (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first attempts to calibrate a surface runoff model with field data for a variety of chemical contaminants.

The attention given to surface runoff contaminant models has not matched the emphasis on pure hydrology models, in spite of their role in the generation of stream loading contaminant data. In the United States the EPA has had difficulty interpreting&lt;ref&gt;Steven Grant, I K Iskandar , ''Contaminant Hydrology'', CRC Press (2000) {{ISBN|1-56670-476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; diverse proprietary contaminant models and has to develop its own models more often than conventional resource agencies, who, focused on [[flood]] forecasting, have had more of a centroid of common basin models.

==Example applications==

Liden applied the [[HBV hydrology model|HBV model]] to estimate the riverine transport of three different substances, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[suspended sediment]]&lt;ref&gt;Rikard Liden, ''Conceptual Runoff Models for Material Transport Estimations'', PhD dissertation, [[Lund University]], Lund, Sweden (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; in four different countries: [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. The relation between internal hydrological model variables and [[nutrient]] transport was assessed. A model for [[nitrogen]] sources was developed and analysed in comparison with a statistical method. A model for suspended sediment transport in [[tropical]] and [[semi-arid]] regions was developed and tested. It was shown that riverine total nitrogen could be well simulated in the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] climate and riverine suspended sediment load could be estimated fairly well in tropical and semi-arid climates. The HBV model for material transport generally estimated material transport loads well. The main conclusion of the study was that the HBV model can be used to predict material transport on the scale of the [[drainage basin]] during stationary conditions, but cannot be easily generalised to areas not specifically calibrated. In a different work, Castanedo et al. applied an evolutionary algorithm to automated watershed model calibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castanedo | first1 = F. | last2 = Patricio | first2 = M.A. | last3 = Molina | first3 = J.M. | year = | title = Evolutionary Computation Technique Applied to HSPF Model Calibration of a Spanish Watershed | doi = 10.1007/11875581_26 | journal = IDEAL | volume = 2006 | issue = | pages = 216–223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:lake-tahoe.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[Lake Tahoe]], [[headwater]] sub-basin of the [[Truckee River]] watershed]]

The United States EPA developed the [[DSSAM Model]] to analyze [[water pollution|water quality]] impacts from [[land use]] and [[wastewater]] management decisions in the [[Truckee River]] basin, an area which include the cities of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Sparks, Nevada]] as well as the [[Lake Tahoe]] basin. The model&lt;ref&gt;''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; satisfactorily predicted nutrient, sediment and dissolved oxygen parameters in the river. It is based on a pollutant loading [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] called "Total Daily Maximum Load" (TDML). The success of this model contributed to the EPA’s commitment to the use of the underlying TDML protocol in EPA’s national policy for management of many river systems in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;USEPA. 1991. ''Guidance for water quality-based decisions: The TMDL process'', EPA 440/4-91-001. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSSAM Model is constructed to allow dynamic decay of most pollutants; for example, total nitrogen and phosphorus are allowed to be consumed by [[Benthic zone|benthic]] [[alga]]e in each time step, and the algal communities are given a separate population dynamic in each river reach (e.g. based upon river temperature). Regarding stormwater runoff in [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], the specific elements within a new [[xeriscape]] ordinance were analyzed for efficacy using the model. For the varied agricultural uses in the watershed, the model was run to understand the principal sources of impact, and management practices were developed to reduce in-river pollution. Use of the model has specifically been conducted to analyze survival of two [[endangered species]] found in the [[Truckee River]] and [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]: the [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]]  (endangered 1967) and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]] (threatened 1970).

[[File:Isla Martana Lago Bolsena.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Martana island in [[Lake Bolsena]], [[Italy]]]]
A '''lake island''' is any landmass within a [[lake]]. It is a type of  [[inland island]].  Lake islands may form a lake [[archipelago]].

== Formation ==
Lake islands may form in numerous ways. They may occur through a build-up of [[sedimentation]] as [[shoal]]s, and become true islands through changes in the level of the lake. They may have been originally part of the lake's shore, and been separated from it by [[erosion]], or they may have been left as pinnacles when the lake formed through a raising in the level of a river or other waterway (either naturally, or artificially through the damming of a river or lake). They may also have formed through [[earthquake]], [[meteor]], or [[volcano|volcanic]] activity. In the latter case, [[crater lake|crater or caldera islands]] exist, with new volcanic prominences in lakes formed in the craters of larger volcanoes. Other lake islands include ephemeral beds of floating vegetation, and islands artificially formed by human activity.

===Volcanic crater and caldera lake islands===
{{Further information|Crater lake}}
Lakes may sometimes form in the circular depressions of [[volcanic crater]]s. These craters are typically circular or oval basins around the vent or vents from which magma erupts. 
A large [[volcanic eruption]] sometimes results in the formation of a [[caldera]], caused by the collapse of the [[magma chamber]] under the volcano. If enough magma is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight of the volcano, and a roughly circular fracture, the [[ring fault]], develops around the edge of the chamber. The centre of the volcano within the ring fracture collapses, creating a ring-shaped depression. Long after the eruption, this caldera may fill with water to become a lake. If volcanic activity continues or restarts, the centre of the caldera may be uplifted in the form of a [[resurgent dome]], to become a crater lake island. Though typically calderas are larger and deeper than craters and form in different ways, a distinction between the two is often ignored in non-technical circumstances and the term [[crater lake]] is widely used for the lakes formed in both craters and calderas. The following is a list of large or notable crater lake islands:

* Teodoro Wolf and Yerovi Islands in [[Cuicocha Lake]], Ecuador
* Teopan Island in [[Lake Coatepeque]], El Salvador
* Islas Quemadas in [[Lake Ilopango]], El Salvador
* Island in [[Lake Wenchi]], Ethiopia
* [[Samosir Island]] in [[Lake Toba]], Sumatra, Indonesia

* [[Wizard Island]] and [[Phantom Ship (island)|Phantom Ship]] in [[Crater Lake]], Oregon, United States

===Impact crater islands===
{{further information|Impact crater|Annular lake}}
[[Impact craters]], formed by the collision of large [[meteorite]]s or [[comet]]s with the Earth, are relatively uncommon, and those which do exist are frequently heavily eroded or deeply buried. Several, however, do contain lakes. Where the impact crater is [[Complex crater|complex]], a central peak emerges from the floor of the crater. If a lake is present, this central peak may break the water's surface as an island. In other cases, other geological processes may have caused only a ring-shaped [[annular lake]] to remain from an impact, with a large central island taking up the remaining area of the crater. The world's largest impact crater island (and the world's second-largest lake island of any kind) is [[René-Levasseur Island]], in [[Lake Manicouagan]], Canada. The [[Sanshan Islands, Wuxi|Sanshan Islands]] of [[Lake Tai]], China, are also examples of impact crater islands, as are the islands in Canada's [[Clearwater Lakes]], and the [[Slate Islands (Ontario)|Slate Islands]] of Lake Superior, also in Canada. [[Sollerön|Sollerön Island]] in [[Siljan (lake)|Siljan Lake]], Sweden, and an unnamed island in Lake [[Karakul (Tajikistan)|Karakul]], Tajikistan, was also formed by meteor impact.

===Floating islands===
{{main article|Floating island}}
The term [[floating island]] is sometimes used for accumulations of vegetation free-floating within a body of water. Due to the lack of currents and tides, these are more frequently found in lakes than in rivers or the open sea. Peaty masses of vegetable matter from shallow lake floors may rise due to the accumulation of gases during decomposition, and will often float for a considerable time, becoming ephemeral islands until the gas has dissipated enough for the vegetation to return to the lake floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marr|first=J.E.|year=1900|title=The scientific study of scenery|location=London|publisher=Methuen|url=https://archive.org/stream/scientificstudy01marrgoog/scientificstudy01marrgoog_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial islands===
{{main article|Artificial island}}
Artificial or man-made islands are islands constructed by human activity rather than formed by natural means. They may be totally created by humans, enlarged from existing islands or reefs, formed by joining small existing islands, or cut from a mainland (for example, by cutting through the isthmus of a peninsula). Artificial islands have a long history, dating back to the [[crannog]]s of prehistoric Britain and Ireland, and the traditional floating [[Uru people|Uru]] islands of [[Lake Titicaca]] in South America. Notable early artificial islands include the Aztec city of [[Tenochtitlan]], at the site of modern [[Mexico City]]. Though technically caused by human activity, islands formed from hilltops by the deliberate flooding of valleys (such as in the creation of [[hydroelectricity]] projects and [[reservoir]]s) are not normally regarded as artificial islands.
[[File:Amsterdam IJburg 20041105.jpg|thumb|The artificial island of IJburg, Amsterdam, Netherlands]]
Artificial islands are built for numerous uses, ranging from flood protection to immigration or quarantine stations. Other uses for reclaimed artificial islands include expansion of living space or transportation centres in densely populated regions. Agricultural land has also been developed through reclamation of [[polder]]s in the Netherlands and other low lying countries.

Notable modern examples of artificial lake islands include the Dutch polder of [[Flevopolder]] in [[Flevoland]], the island of [[IJburg]] in [[Amsterdam]], and Flamingo Island in [[Kamfers Dam]], South Africa. At {{convert|948|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, Flevopolder, in the now-freshwater lake [[IJsselmeer]], is the largest man-made island in the world.

== Lists of lake islands ==

=== Naturally occurring lake islands, by area ===

# [[Manitoulin Island]] in [[Lake Huron]], [[Canada]] – {{convert|2,766|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="World Atlas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/islands.htm |title=Islands of the World: Largest Lake Islands|publisher= World Atlas| accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[René-Levasseur Island]] in the [[Manicouagan Reservoir]], [[Quebec]], Canada – {{convert|2,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="World Atlas"/&gt; It became an artificial island when the [[Manicouagan Reservoir]] was flooded in 1970, merging Mouchalagane Lake on the western side and Manicouagan Lake on the eastern side.
# [[Soisalo]] between the lakes [[Kallavesi]], [[Suvasvesi]], [[Kermajärvi]], [[Ruokovesi]], [[Haukivesi]] and [[Unnukka]], [[Finland]] – {{convert|1,638|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Some{{who|date=May 2016}} consider that Soisalo is not a real island because the lakes surrounding it are not on the same level. The greatest difference between the surrounding lakes is 6 m.
# [[Olkhon]] in [[Lake Baikal]], [[Russia]] – {{convert|730|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="World Atlas"/&gt;
# [[Isle Royale]] in [[Lake Superior]], [[United States]] – {{convert|541|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="World Atlas"/&gt;
# [[Ukerewe Island]] in [[Lake Victoria]], [[Tanzania]] – {{convert|530|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="World Atlas"/&gt;
# [[St. Joseph Island (Ontario)|St. Joseph Island]] in Lake Huron, Canada – {{convert|365|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="World Atlas"/&gt;
# [[Drummond Island]] in Lake Huron, United States – {{convert|347|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="World Atlas"/&gt;
# [[Idjwi]] in [[Lake Kivu]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] – {{convert|285|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="World Atlas"/&gt;
# [[Ometepe Island]] in [[Lake Nicaragua]], [[Nicaragua]] – {{convert|276|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="worldislandinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldislandinfo.com/LAKEV1.htm |title=Largest Lake Islands of the World |publisher=WorldIslandInfo.com |accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Bugala Island]] in Lake Victoria, Uganda –  {{convert|275|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="worldislandinfo"/&gt;
# [[St Ignace Island]] in Lake Superior, Canada –  {{convert|274|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="worldislandinfo"/&gt;
Note: [[Samosir]] in [[Lake Toba]], [[Indonesia]] – {{convert|630|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="World Atlas"/&gt; was originally formed as a peninsula; its current island status, however, is only through its deliberate separation from the mainland by a canal. For this reason, it is not included in the above list.&lt;!--

a cutoff of 100 sq miles seems appropriate, given that this also leaves a round dozen islands--&gt;

===Other lake islands larger than 80 km²===

* [[Ukara Island]] in [[Lake Victoria]], [[Tanzania]] – {{convert|81|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;!--

A working criteria for inclusion of greater than 80 km² will probably keep this section short enough. --&gt;

===Islands within lakes recursively===
* The largest lake on an island is [[Nettilling Lake]] on [[Baffin Island]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=elbruz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elbruz.org/Special%20Projects/Islands%20and%20Lakes.htm|title=Some interesting islands and lakes|publisher=Elbruz|accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The largest island in a lake is [[Manitoulin Island]] in [[Lake Huron]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=elbruz/&gt;
* The largest island in a lake on an island is [[Pulau Samosir]] in [[Danau Toba]] on [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref name=elbruz/&gt;
* The largest lake on an island in a lake is [[Lake Manitou]] on Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron.&lt;ref name=elbruz/&gt;
* The largest lake on an island in a lake on an island is a nameless, approximately {{convert|375|acre|ha|disp=flip|adj=on}} lake at {{coord|66.387|N|69.645|W|display=inline}} on nameless island in [[Nettilling Lake]] on [[Baffin Island]], [[Canada]].
* The largest island in a lake on an island in a lake is [[Treasure Island (Ontario)|Treasure Island]] in [[Mindemoya Lake]] on Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron.&lt;ref name=elbruz/&gt;
* The largest island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island is a nameless, approximately {{convert|10|acre|ha|disp=flip|adj=on}} island at {{coord|66.687|N|70.479|W|display=inline}}, situated within [[Nettilling Lake]] on [[Baffin Island]], [[Canada]].

===Notable island systems and former lake islands===
* [[Vozrozhdeniya Island]] in the [[Aral Sea]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] – {{convert|2,300|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="World Atlas"/&gt;  Became a peninsula in 2002 due to the shrinking of the sea, so no longer appears in rankings.
* [[Sääminginsalo]] in [[Saimaa]], [[Finland]] – {{convert|1069|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Saimaa is sometimes referred to as a "lake system", and Sääminginsalo is surrounded by three separately named lakes ([[Haukivesi]], [[Puruvesi]] and [[Pihlajavesi (Saimaa)|Pihlajavesi]]) that are at the same level, and by an artificial canal, ''Raikuun kanava'', built in 1750s. Since it is detached from land by a canal, it is debatable whether Sääminginsalo can be considered an island.

Category&amp;nbsp;3 is the third-highest classification on the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale]], and categorizes [[tropical cyclones]] with 1-minute [[maximum sustained winds]] between {{convert|96|kn|mph km/h m/s|lk=on}} and {{convert|112|kn|mph km/h m/s}}. Tropical cyclones that attain such winds and [[landfall|move over land]] while maintaining those winds are capable of causing severe damage to human lives and infrastructure. From 1949 to 2018, a total of 82 recorded [[Pacific hurricane]]s have peaked at Category&amp;nbsp;3 strength within the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Eastern Pacific|Northeast Pacific tropical cyclone basin]], which is denoted as the part of the [[Pacific Ocean]] north of the [[equator]] and east of the [[International Date Line]]. This does not include storms that also attained Category&amp;nbsp;4 or 5 status on the scale.

The development of Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific basin is influenced by many factors. During the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring months of December to April, [[sea surface temperature]]s in the tropics are usually too low to support [[tropical cyclogenesis]]. Furthermore, from January to April, the [[North Pacific High]] and [[Aleutian Low]] induce strong [[vertical wind shear]] and unfavorable conditions that serve to prevent the development of hurricanes. These effects are reduced or even disappear during hurricane season from May to November, when sea surface temperatures are also high enough to support tropical cyclogenesis; the bulk of recorded Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricanes developed during June to October. Global weather patterns may also influence hurricane development in the Northeast Pacific. [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño events]] result in increased numbers of powerful hurricanes through weaker wind shear and higher [[sea surface temperature]]s within the basin, while [[La Niña]] events reduce the number of such hurricanes through the opposite.

On the Saffir–Simpson scale, a hurricane reaches Category&amp;nbsp;3 status when it attains [[maximum sustained wind]]s of between {{convert|96|kn|mph km/h m/s|lk=on}} and {{convert|112|kn|mph km/h m/s}}.&lt;ref name="SSHWS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/sshws.pdf|title=The Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale|first1=Timothy|last1=Schott|first2=Christopher W|last2=Landsea|first3=Gene|last3=Hafale|first4=Jeffrey|last4=Lorens|first5=Arthur|last5=Taylor|first6=Harvey|last6=Thurm|first7=Bill|last7=Ward|first8=Mark|last8=Willis|first9=Walt|last9=Zaleski|date=February 1, 2012|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|location=[[Miami, Florida]]|access-date=May 24, 2018|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213223055/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/sshws.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) takes sustained winds to be the average wind speed measured over the period of one minute at the height of {{convert|10|m|ft}} above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D4.html|title=TCFAQ D4) What does "maximum sustained wind" mean?

The Northeast Pacific [[tropical cyclone basin]] is defined as the region of the Pacific Ocean north of the [[equator]] and east of the [[International Date Line]]. The Northeast Pacific is further divided into two sub-basins, namely the east and central Pacific. The east Pacific runs east of the [[140th meridian west]], and tropical cyclones occurring there are warned upon by the [[National Hurricane Center]], the current [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] (RSMC) for that area. The central Pacific, running from the 140th meridian west to the International Date Line, currently has the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] as its RSMC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/F1.html|title=TCFAQ F1) What regions around the globe have tropical cyclones and who is responsible for forecasting there?|first=Christopher W|last=Landsea|date=June 1, 2018|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113000158/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/F1.html|archive-date=2012-11-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical cyclones are generally much rarer in the central Pacific than in the east Pacific, with an average of just four to five storms forming or moving into the central Pacific compared to around 15 for the east Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPHC Climatology|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/pages/climatology.php|publisher=[[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AsDoYMIJ?url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/pages/climatology.php|archive-date=2012-09-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background Information: East Pacific Hurricane Season|url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Epac_hurr/background_information.html|date=May 27, 2015|publisher=[[Climate Prediction Center]]|accessdate=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gsJts3lk?url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Epac_hurr/background_information.html|archive-date=2009-05-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All tropical cyclones recorded by past and present RSMCs of the Northeast Pacific basin since 1949 are listed in the Northeast and North Central Pacific hurricane database (HURDAT), which is compiled and maintained by the National Hurricane Center.{{Tropical Cyclones of the Eastern North Pacific Basin, 1949-2006}}&lt;ref name="EPAC HURDAT"/&gt;

Before 1970, tropical cyclones within the Northeast Pacific were classified into three categories: tropical depression, tropical storm, and hurricane; these were assigned intensities of 30&amp;nbsp;mph (45&amp;nbsp;km/h), 50&amp;nbsp;mph (85&amp;nbsp;km/h), and 85&amp;nbsp;mph (140&amp;nbsp;km/h) respectively. Exceptions to these rules would be storms that affected humans and as such humans were able to measure or estimate wind speeds or pressure data.{{Tropical Cyclones of the Eastern North Pacific Basin, 1949-2006}} Due to this lack of specific intensity records, there has been only one confirmed Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane prior to 1970.&lt;ref name="EPAC HURDAT"/&gt;

Ekeka is the only Category&amp;nbsp;3 Pacific hurricane to develop outside of the normal dates of the Pacific hurricane season.|alt=A small, intense hurricane in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.]]
Hurricane season in the Northeast Pacific tropical cyclone basin begins on May&amp;nbsp;15 in the east Pacific and June&amp;nbsp;1 in the central Pacific, and ends on November&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;ref name="SeasonDates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html|title=TCFAQ G1) When is hurricane season?|first=Neal|last=Dorst|date=June 2, 2016|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|access-date=July 24, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gYGdo8A6?url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html|archive-date=2009-05-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1949, a total of 82 Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricanes have developed in the Northeast Pacific basin. Only one has occurred in the off-season: Hurricane Ekeka of 1992, which peaked in February. Only one Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane has reached that intensity in May.

The formation and development of tropical cyclones, termed [[tropical cyclogenesis]], requires high [[sea surface temperature]]s of at least {{convert|26.5|C|F|abbr=on|lk=on}} and low vertical [[wind shear]]. When these conditions are met, a pre-existing tropical disturbance&amp;nbsp;– usually a [[tropical wave]]&amp;nbsp;– can develop into a tropical cyclone, provided the disturbance is far enough from the [[Equator]] to experience a sufficiently strong [[Coriolis force]] which is responsible for the counterclockwise rotation of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="cyclogenesis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html|title=TCFAQ A15) How do tropical cyclones form?|first=Christopher W|last=Landsea|year=2014|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|access-date=August 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827030639/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html|archive-date=2009-08-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter and spring months of December to April, sea surface temperatures in the tropics are usually too low to support development. Also, the presence of a [[ridge (meteorology)|semi-permanent high-pressure area]] known as the [[North Pacific High]] in the eastern Pacific greatly suppresses formation of tropical cyclones in the winter, as the North Pacific High results in vertical wind shear that causes environmental conditions to be unconducive to tropical cyclone formation. Another factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the presence of a semi-permanent [[low-pressure area]] called the [[Aleutian Low]] between January and April. Its effects in the central Pacific near the [[160th meridian west]] cause tropical waves that form in the area to drift northward into the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and dissipate or become [[extratropical]]. Its retreat in late-April allows the warmth of the Pacific High to meander in, bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it. The [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] departs southward in mid-May permitting the formation of the earliest tropical waves,&lt;ref name="longshore"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones|last=Longshore|first=David|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Facts on File, Inc]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8160-3398-0|edition=1st|pages=333, 334|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=8kXwskQHBLoC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;lpg=PA334&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qFGf1P76-U&amp;sig=RvDUOXniAjo9XgEkcKZRVx0qtEI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNh9Ta0_bcAhXNXn0KHfmWBesQ6AEwDXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|access-date=2018-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818214458/https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=8kXwskQHBLoC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;lpg=PA334&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qFGf1P76-U&amp;sig=RvDUOXniAjo9XgEkcKZRVx0qtEI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNh9Ta0_bcAhXNXn0KHfmWBesQ6AEwDXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=2018-08-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on May&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;ref name="SeasonDates"/&gt; During summer and autumn, sea surface temperatures rise further to reach near {{convert|29|C|F|abbr=on}} in July and August, well above the {{convert|26.5|C|F|abbr=on}} threshold for tropical cyclogenesis. This allows for hurricanes developing during that time to strengthen significantly.&lt;ref name="longshore"/&gt;

The [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] also influences the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific basin. During years with the existence of an El Niño event, [[sea surface temperature]]s increase in the Northeast Pacific and average vertical wind shear decreases, resulting in an increase in activity; the opposite happens in the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Northern Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic basin]] during El Niño, where increased wind shear creates an unfavorable environment for tropical cyclone formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Hurricanes/hurricanes_3.php|title=Hurricanes: The Greatest Storms on Earth: Feature Articles|first1=Steve|last1=Graham|first2=Holli|last2=Riebeek|date=November 1, 2006|work=[[NASA Earth Observatory|Earth Observatory]]|publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|accessdate=July 24, 2018|location=United States|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506091751/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Hurricanes/hurricanes_3.php|archive-date=2017-05-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to El Niño, [[La Niña]] increases wind shear and decreases sea surface temperatures over the eastern Pacific, while reducing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures over the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="longshore"/&gt;

Within the Northeast Pacific, tropical cyclones generally head west out into the open Pacific Ocean, steered by the westward [[trade wind]]s. Closer to the end of the season, however, some storms are steered northwards or northeastwards around the [[subtropical ridge]] nearer the end of the season, and may bring impacts to the western coasts of [[Mexico]] and occasionally even [[Central America]]. In the central Pacific basin, the North Pacific High keeps tropical cyclones away from the Hawaiian Islands by forcing them southwards.&lt;ref name="longshore"/&gt; Combined with cooler waters around the Hawaiian Islands that tend to weaken approaching tropical cyclones, this makes direct impacts on the Hawaiian Islands by tropical cyclones rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2018-08-03-hawaii-hurricane-tropical-typical-track-history|title=Hawaii Hurricanes: How Unusual Are They?|last=Belles|first=Jonathan|date=August 3, 2018|work=[[The Weather Channel]]|access-date=August 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820203427/https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2018-08-03-hawaii-hurricane-tropical-typical-track-history|archive-date=2018-08-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quill''' were a humanoid species from the planet Rhodia who had a long history of war with the other species on Rhodia, the Rhodians. All the Rhodians and the Quill were killed by the Shadow Kin, except the Prince of Rhodia and Andra'ath, the Quill freedom fighter who was indentured to him via an Arn in her brain. The two were rescued by the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and brought to Coal Hill Academy, where the prince took on the name "Charlie Smith" and Andra'ath the name "Miss Quill". On Earth, Miss Quill was able to remove the Arn in her brain with the aid of Ballon.

}}

The '''Racnoss''' appeared in the [[Tenth Doctor]] story "[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]" in 2006.

The Racnoss are described by the Tenth Doctor as an ancient race of aliens from the Dark Times of the universe. Half-humanoid, half-arachnid in appearance, they were an invasion force who consumed everything on the planets they conquered. Their race was wiped out by the Fledgling Empires, over 4.6 billion years ago. Although the Time Lords are not specified as being a part of the Empires, the Doctor acknowledges that his people unravelled their power source, Huon particles, and upon hearing the name of the Doctor's planet, [[Gallifrey]], the [[List of Doctor Who villains#Empress of the Racnoss|Empress]] claims that they "murdered" the Racnoss. The Doctor and [[Donna Noble]] are shown witnessing nearly all of the survivors of the race escape in their ship to where the Earth would later [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|form]], serving in place of a [[planetesimal]] as its core, hibernating for billions of years, with the exception of their Empress. The Doctor notes that because the Huon particles ceased to exist, the surviving Racnoss are stuck in hibernation. The Empress is seen coming to Earth in her ship, the Webstar in this episode, seeking to use the Huon particles which had been recreated by the [[Torchwood Institute]] using the water of the [[River Thames]] as a means of reviving her "children" before feasting on the human population of Earth. The last Racnoss are presumed wiped out when the Doctor drains the waters of the Thames down the shaft leading to their ship; the Empress is killed when her own ship is destroyed by the British army at the order of "[[The Master (Doctor Who)|Mr Saxon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Runaway Bride |episode-link=The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who) |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Russell T (writer) |last=Davies |author-link=Russell T Davies |first2=Euros (director) |last2=Lyn |author-link2=Euros Lyn |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=25 December 2006 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Empress appears briefly in a flashback in "[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]" (2008). In the parallel universe created by Donna, she has still been defeated, but the Doctor, without Donna to stop him and ultimately save his life, is shown having drowned; a UNIT soldier speculates that he died "too fast for him to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]]"; without his protection, the Earth is shown becoming a [[dystopia]] over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Turn Left |episode-link=Turn Left (Doctor Who) |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Russell T (writer) |last=Davies |author-link=Russell T Davies |first2=Graeme (director) |last2=Harper |author-link2=Graeme Harper |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=21 June 2008 |season= |series-no=4 |number=11 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Racnoss also appear in the ''[[Doctor Who: Classic Doctors, New Monsters]]'' audio ''Empire of the Racnoss'', which sees the [[Fifth Doctor]] being drawn into the war against the Racnoss in the distant past when a call for help during the war is picked up by a long-dormant program in the TARDIS, resulting in the Doctor being caught up in a political struggle between the Empress of the Racnoss and her traitorous old consort and her replacement consort.

===Raxacoricofallapatorians===
[[File:Slitheen (3151315454).jpg|thumb|Slitheen, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience|alt=]]
{{Main|Slitheen}}
Native to [[Raxacoricofallapatorius]], Raxacoricofallapatorians are grouped by extended family names which are sometimes used to refer to their species generically. They hatch from eggs and are composed of living calcium. Capital punishment is practised on the home world, which involves immersion of convicted criminals in acid that slowly dissolves them while still alive.

The Slitheen family are a ruthless criminal sect motivated by profit. Convicted for their crimes on Raxacoricofallapatorius, they have been exiled from their homeworld and face execution if they return.

The Blathereen family are sworn enemies of the [[Slitheen]], and have infiltrated the prison on the planet Justicia.&lt;ref&gt;BBC BOOK, The Monsters Inside&lt;/ref&gt;

A Raxacoricofallapatorian appears in an alien bar in ''[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]''.

===Reaper===
{{Doctor Who race
|name=Reapers|type=Extradimensional flying reptiles
|affiliation=None
|planet=None (Outside of time and space)
|start="[[Father's Day (Doctor Who)|Father's Day]]" (2005)
}}
'''Reapers''' appeared in the [[Ninth Doctor]] episode "[[Father's Day (Doctor Who)|Father's Day]]", written by [[Paul Cornell]]. Although not named on screen, they were referred to as "Reapers" in the publicity material for the episode. The production team based their design on the [[Grim Reaper]], with their tails shaped like [[scythe]]s.

Reapers are multi-limbed, flying creatures similar to [[pterosaur]]s, with a large wingspan, sharp teeth both in the form of a beak and a secondary mouth in their torsos, coupled with a rapacious attitude. The Reapers are apparently extradimensional, materialising and dematerialising out of the [[spacetime]] vortex. They are attracted to temporal [[physical paradox|paradoxes]] that damage time, like bacteria swarming around a wound. They then proceed to "sterilise" the wound by consuming everyone in sight. The older the thing they devour the more it satisfies them.

Once in this dimension, however, they can be blocked by material barriers. The older the barriers, the more effective they are, but even the oldest of barriers cannot stop them forever. Paradoxes can also allow them to directly materialise at the spot of the paradox. If the timeline is restored, they vanish, with their actions reversed as if they had never happened.

In "Father's Day", the Doctor explained that when the [[Time Lord]]s were still around, there were laws to prevent the spread of paradoxes and that such paradoxes could be repaired. This implies that the Reapers are a natural phenomenon whose manifestation could be prevented if the paradox was resolved quickly. However, with the elimination of the other Time Lords in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], there was no longer any agency that could repair time.

&lt;!-- Speculation commented out until a source to verify this can be found
The Reapers are reminiscent of the [[#Vortisaur|Vortisaurs]] of the [[Big Finish Productions]] [[radio drama|audio plays]], the Hunters of the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[The Pit (Doctor Who)|The Pit]]'' by Neil Penswick, and the depiction of the Chronovores (first featured in ''[[The Time Monster]]'') in Cornell's own novel ''[[No Future]]''.

The '''Rhodians''' were a humanoid species that ruled the planet Rhodia and had a long history of war with the Quill. All the Rhodians and the Quill were killed by the Shadow Kin, except the Prince of Rhodia and the Quill freedom fighter who was indentured to him. The two were rescued by the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and brought to Coal Hill Academy, where the prince took on the name "Charlie Smith" and Andra'ath the name "Miss Quill". Charlie managed to bring the Cabinet of Souls with him to Earth, a device that contained the souls of all the fallen Rhodians, which he later used to wipe out all the Shadow Kin when they invaded Earth.

'''Saturnyn''' are vampiric, lobster-like aliens that battled the [[Eleventh Doctor]] in 16th-century [[Venice]] in "[[The Vampires of Venice]]" (2010). Their appearance is quite obviously fear-inducing due to many sharp protrusions and fangs. They were able to breathe underwater and had vampire-like qualities such as a vulnerability to sunlight, no reflections and a thirst for human blood. However, these are easily explainable; as "fish from space", they are used to living in the dark depths; anyone's mind cannot deal with conflicting information of a perception filter and a Saturnyn's true reflection; Rosanna and Francesco drank the blood of the girls attending the school so they could replace it with their own. Their leader, [[List of Doctor Who villains#Signora Rosanna Calvierri|Signora Rosanna Calvierri]] used a perception filter to appear as a human woman, who started a school for girls; it was a guise for seeking victims to be transformed into mates for Francesco's brothers. They planned to flood Venice in an attempt to continue their civilization since their own planet Saturnyne was destroyed by cracks in the universe. When the Doctor foiled their plan, Rosanna committed suicide by allowing her brood to [[Cannibalism|devour]] her. However, when the Doctor rewrote time in "[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]" (2010) by preventing the cracks' existence, it is highly likely Saturnyne was not destroyed by the cracks and the Calvierri family did not end.

The Doctor, at least in his eleventh incarnation, considered his adventure battling the Saturnyens to be memorable. In "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]" (2011), he said his adventures were "running about, sexy, fish vampires, and blowing up stuff", and even asked Melody Pond if Amy told her about the "Vampires in Venice" during "[[Let's Kill Hitler]]" (2011).

}}
An unnamed gaseous alien parasite that comes to Earth to feed on [[orgasm]]ic energy in "[[Day One (Torchwood)|Day One]]" (2006), claiming that there's no other energy in the universe like it; it's possible that orgasmic energy is like a drug to the gas, and that it's addicted. Composed of vorax and ceranium gases, Earth's atmosphere is poisonous to the alien, so it needs to take a human host to survive for prolonged periods; it doesn't show up on cameras. It vies for control with its host, causing physiological changes that will eventually cause the host's internal organs to explode.

The alien also makes its host secrete a blend of ultra-powerful [[pheromone]]s that cause tremendous sexual attraction in those around it for the purposes of feeding; those with stronger wills might be able to resist the pheromones. Coupling with the host is fatal, causing the host's partner to disintegrate into a pile of dust at climax and allowing the alien to absorb the energy from the orgasm. It appeared to know human biology well (or at least just enough), knowing it needed the opposite gender in order to get the energy. It was tricked out of its host and left in a portable energy prison until it expired from being poisoned by the earth's air.

The BBC Torchwood website lists it as the "Sex gas". Producer [[Russell T Davies]], in the documentary series ''Torchwood Declassified'', refers to it as a "sex monster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

The '''Shadow Kin''' were a race of fire-type humanoids from the Underneath. The Shadow Kin could exist as pure shadow and in a solid form, but could only survive physically with the presence of a shadow. They were ruled by the Shadow King, who ruled from the Shadow Palace on the Underneath. The Shadow Kin arrived on Rhodia in the midst of a civil war and killed all the Rhodians and Quills save the Rhodian prince Charlie Smith and his Quill protector Miss Quill, who were rescued by the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and brought to Coal Hill Academy. Following them to Earth, the Shadow Kin, led by Corakinus, emerged through a tear in space-time at the school's prom night but were forced back by the Doctor. During the invasion, when Coal Hill student April MacLean fired a displacement gun at Corakinus and Charlie pushed her out of the way, she and Corakinus began sharing April's heart. April found her way to the Shadow Palace and defeated Corakinus in battle. She became the new king, and had the Shadow Kin lock up Corakinus. However, they later returned to invade Earth again under Corakinus' command. Charlie decided to use a displacement gun to kill April and Corakinus, thus allowing Charlie to become the new Shadow King. As King, he ordered his army to retreat, and then he used the Cabinet of Souls to wipe all the Shadow Kin out of existence. After he used the cabinet, April resurrected but in Corakinus' body.

The Shakri are a species spoken of in [[Time Lord|Gallifreyan]] myths, said to be the "pest controllers of the universe"; Amy Pond found it a "strange choice for a bed-time story". They attack any species that they believe will pose a threat to the universe, hence why they tried eliminating humanity in the 21st century, years before they could colonise space in the future. A hologram of a wrinkled humanoid in a black robe was seen on the Shakri ship; however, it is not known if this is actually what the Shakri look like. The Shakri consider seven an important number, given they used that amount of portals, ships, cube activation time, and for a countdown. They follow something known as "the Tally"; [[Eleventh Doctor|the Doctor]] has implied that the Shakri compare a species' failures and successes to decide whether or not they will be subjected to "pest control".

===Shalka===
{{Infobox Doctor Who race

}}
The '''Shalka''' appear to be a [[snake|serpentine]] alien race made of living rock and [[magma]], but they are actually bioplasmic entities, living plasma, their physical appearance merely a "crust" concealing their true forms. They breathe volcanic air and prefer high temperatures, being most comfortable underground where lava meets [[metamorphic rock]]. They communicate through high-pitched screaming, which they can use for a variety of effects, like tunnelling through rock or mentally controlling other life forms. They also use sound as a part of their technology.

In an alternate timeline, the Shalka arrived on Earth via meteorite, initially landing near [[Mount Ruapehu]], New Zealand, subsequently establishing a beachhead for their planned invasion of Earth beneath the [[Lancashire]] town of Lannet. They also created a stable [[wormhole]] for landing their invasion force, which could also be converted into a [[black hole]] to dispose of their enemies, as they tried to do with the [[Shalka Doctor|Doctor]].

As they claimed to have done to billions of planets before, they intended to implant Shalka larvae into key segments of the population, mind controlling them into emitting a scream that would destroy the [[ozone layer]]. In this way, the Shalka intended to raise the surface temperature of the planet to the point where the human race would perish but the Shalka could thrive. The Shalka would then live beneath the surface, with the rest of the universe believing that Earth's inhabitants had died of self-inflicted ecological damage. The Doctor defeated their plans with the help of the British military and a Lannet barmaid named [[List of Doctor Who spin-off companions#Alison Cheney|Alison]].
They are not technically Doctor Who monsters since they appeared in a failed attempt to restart the series before it was permanently revived.

A fleet of Shansheeth announce to Sarah Jane via UNIT the death of the Doctor, and take charge of the funeral procession; Mr Smith confirms their status as the undertakers of the universe, finding fallen heroes on battlefields. However, the band of Shansheeth Sarah Jane and former companion [[Jo Grant|Jo Jones]] ([[Katy Manning]]) encounter want to use the companions' memories of the Doctor, in conjunction with their Memory Weave device to create a TARDIS key with which they can steal the TARDIS and prevent death across the timeline. Sarah and Jo, instead, overload the device, which blows up and destroys the Shansheeth along with their UNIT accomplice. The main branch of the Shansheeth later apologise to Sarah Jane for the actions of this rogue group.

==="Simon"===
'''"Simon"''' was an alien mentioned on the Torchwood website, specifically in an article attached to, and especially in, Amanda Davies' diary. He was travelling on Earth, seeking to discover the source of life. He wandered into a countryside village and was taken in by the Davies family. Simon, having based his appearance on Jon Bon Jovi, near-instantly seduced the family's daughter - Amanda, and ultimately left her pregnant with an alien baby (which itself quickly developed, and began to degrade her health). Simon then disappeared around the same time as Jack Harkness arrived (implying he had been captured or killed by Torchwood), and later Jack met with Amanda's father and (apparently) made an agreement to have the entire village, including Amanda, subjected to amnesia pills, have all records and evidence that the Davies' existed in the village (including Amanda's diary) confiscated, have the alien baby removed before Amanda died, and then send the Davies family away with a new identity.

===The Silence===
{{Main|Silence (Doctor Who)}}
Self-proclaimed "Sentinels of History", the Silence are genetically engineered members of the Papal Mainframe under the Academy of the Question. As they were originally created as confessional priests, Silents cannot be remembered unless they are being looked at, or if someone is wearing an eyedrive. In "[[The Time of the Doctor]]" (2013), with the Doctor's enemies converging on Trenzalore, the Papal Mainframe underwent a faith conversion into the Church of the Silence whose main belief is that "Silence will fall" to keep the Doctor from answering the oldest question in the universe "Doctor Who?" to avert a war caused by the Time Lords' return. However, a group of Silents under a splinter chapel led by Madam Kovarian wanted to completely avoid the Siege of Trenzalore by eliminating the Doctor: their attempts range from destroying reality in Series 5, which caused the events at Trenzalore, and using [[River Song (Doctor Who)|Melody Pond]] in an attempt to murder the Doctor in Series 6. The Silents still loyal to the Papal Mainframe remain and joined forces with the Doctor to fight back all the villains converging on Trenzalore.

The Siren is a virtual doctor that was aboard a spaceship of an unknown alien race that crashed in a dimension parallel to the ocean the ship ''Fancy'' was sailing on in 1699. Thanks to "protein circuitry", she could appear before a species in a form that would be alluring to them for cooperation. To sedate her patients, the Siren could sing a beautiful vocal song. However, being nothing more than a program, the Siren had '''very''' little reasoning skills. The Siren turned red with demonic-looking face when faced with resistance and germs. When the ship she was doctor to crashed in a spatial rift where the ''Fancy'' had been becalmed (and the crew dead from a human disease), she impulsively started to take the injured of the ship, even if it was for a simple cut, showing a great lack of intelligence. Were it not for the Doctor's arrival, the Siren would eventually have reached shore and started trying to process anyone who was ill. Captain Henry Avery, Toby Avery and the crew of the ''Fancy'' took over the ship to give her someone to look after, and to see the universe.

The sky fish are fish-like creature capable of swimming through the air using the electricity of the planet Ember's crystalline fog. They are attracted to music as it causes the crystals in the fog to resonate in a way that produces delta waves. They vary from small fish to fully grown sharks.

===Slitheen===
{{Main|Slitheen}}

The '''Slitheen''' are a family of massive, bipedal extraterrestrials. They are creatures of living calcium, hatched from eggs and native to the planet [[Raxacoricofallapatorius]]. While, strictly speaking, the name "Slitheen" refers to a specific family, the term has been used by the Doctor to refer to the Raxacoricofallapatorian race in general.

The Slitheen are able to wear a human's skin as a disguise, using a compression field to shrink themselves. As they are mostly made of calcium, they are vulnerable to [[acetic acid]] ([[vinegar]]).

The Slitheen have appeared in the ''Doctor Who'' episodes "[[Aliens of London]]", "[[World War Three (Doctor Who)|World War Three]]" and "[[Boom Town]]" and the interactive episode, "[[Attack of the Graske]]" (all 2005). "[[From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love]]", a mini episode of ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' for Comic Relief, featured [[Ronnie Corbett]] as a small Slitheen. They have also appeared in ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' episodes ''[[Revenge of the Slitheen]]'' and ''[[The Lost Boy (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Lost Boy]]''.

The Slitheen are mentioned as being part of The Alliance formed to trap the Doctor in "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" (2010).

===Slyther===
The '''Slyther''' was a monster that served the [[Daleks]]. It was seen in episodes four and five of ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'' (1964), guarding the Dalek mines in [[Bedfordshire]].

The '''Solonians''' are a race of humanoid creatures from the planet [[Sontar|Solos]], colonized by [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens#Overlord|the Overlords]]. The atmosphere contains a nitrogen isotope which causes the air to become toxic to humans in sunlight, although it has no effect on Solonians. Because Solos' environment changes drastically every 500 years, they must undergo major mutations periodically in order to survive.

===Sontarans===

{{Main|Sontarans}}

A '''Sontaran''' first appeared as the antagonist in the Third Doctor serial ''[[The Time Warrior]]'' (1973–74). The '''Sontarans''' were referred to in ''[[Eye of the Gorgon]]'' by [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#Bea Nelson-Stanley|Bea]] who said they looked like a huge potato with a raygun. Commander Kaagh appears in Series 2 in the story ''[[The Last Sontaran]]'' after the destruction of his battle fleet as well as the death of the other Sontarans on board in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' two-parter episodes "[[The Sontaran Strategem]]" and "[[The Poison Sky]]" (2008). He returns in ''[[Enemy of the Bane]]'', where he sides up with Mrs Wormwood, the recurring Bane. In the end, he sacrifices himself to foil her plans of the destruction of Earth. He makes a small appearance in "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" (2010). The Sontarans remain slightly miffed that they weren't allowed to fight in the Time War.

As seen with Strax, Sontarans can't tell the difference between men and women ("Two genders is a bit further than [they] can count"), and think polite terms such as Miss or Mister are military ranks.

===Spiridon===
The '''Spiridons''' featured in the serial ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'' (1973). They are the dominant species of sentient humanoids on planet [[Sontar|Spiridon]] in the Ninth System. They have developed a form of invisibility, capable of generating "anti-reflecting light waves". They become visible after death, having pale skin and a gaunt appearance. They wear heavy purple fur cloaks at night to protect themselves from the harsh nights of Spiridon. [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] returns to Spiridon in spin-off audio adventures ''[[Return of the Daleks]]'' and ''[[Brotherhood of the Daleks]]''.

The '''star whale''' is a giant whale-like creature, presumed to be the last of its kind, used to pilot the Starship UK, so as to save its citizens from the dangerous solar flares. The whale has the features of other animals such as an anglerfish angler, an octopus' tentacles and a scorpions' tail, as well as having a bright [[pink]] hide with bioluminescent patches. It arrived on Earth as it heard the children of the United Kingdom crying, and was unable to bear the sound. Believing its arrival to be a one-in-a-million miracle, the people of Britain captured it and built their ship around it, torturing it via powerful electric pulses, administered directly into the opened pain center of the Whale's brain, in order to keep the ship flying. Over the years, they realised that they could not justify keeping the creature in agony, but feared that if they set it free, the ship and all those aboard would be destroyed as the creature fled, so they chose to instead forget, and fed those who protested to the beast. When the Doctor learnt of this, he decided to render the creature brain-dead, ending its suffering and saving the lives of all those on the ship, but [[Amy Pond|Amy]] set it free, revealing that the whale had volunteered to help, and that contrary to the beliefs of the station's masters, that it would continue flying without the need to torture it. The creature's exact size is not specified, and it is only visible in its entirety towards the episode's ending.

The '''Stenza''' are a warrior race who possess sub-zero body temperatures. As physical contact with any part of them can cause death from sub-zero burns, Stenza require the use of specialised suits to be able to interact safely with other lifeforms. The Stenza maintain two traditions amongst their people - a ritualistic hunt to earn the right of leadership, in which a Stenza hunts a randomly selected quarry without the use of weapons or any form of aid; and collecting a tooth from a kill to later apply to their face. The Stenza are noted for conducting [[ethnic cleansing]] on planets they conquer, as revealed in "[[The Ghost Monument]]", using the conquered populace to create weapons for their use.

===Stigorax===

Fifi's death showed Helen A that sadness could not be prevented.

===Swampie===

Green-skinned, green-haired natives of the third moon of Delta Magma. Other than their colour, they appear similar to humans. Swampies are intelligent but primitive, lacking technology. They worship a giant squid-like creature called Kroll. Throughout ''The Power of Kroll'', only male Swampies are seen.

===The Swarm===
{{Main|Planet of the Dead}}

Also known by the Unified Intelligence-Taskforce ([[UNIT]]) as Stingrays, they are flying [[manta ray]]-like creatures, with metal exoskeletons that allow them to travel from planet to planet via wormholes. They consume everything on a planet, turning it into desert; and then swarm over the planet's surface, generating a wormhole which allows them to travel to the next planet.

The Stingrays are apparently arthropods, as they are exothermic, and possess an exoskeleton composed of metal that has been ingested then exuded to the exoskeleton. They are voracious feeders, eating both organic and inorganic materials ranging from flesh and bone to plant matter to metals and plastic. They also produce vast numbers of young and grow from birth to adult in under a year, as shown when the [[Tenth Doctor]] shows a year-old clip of San Helios before its Stingray infestation.

They travel to other planets through [[wormholes]] created in the fabric of Spacetime by circling a planet faster and faster, and as each swarm can contain billions of giant stingrays, they rip a hole in space. Their wormholes can transport the whole swarm an infinite distance through space.

{{See also|The Christmas Invasion}}
The '''Sycorax''' first appeared in the debut [[Tenth Doctor]] story "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" in 2005.

The Sycorax appear to be skinless humanoids wearing mantles of bone, usually keeping their features concealed under helmets. They are proficient in the use of weapons like swords and whips, the latter which can deliver an energy discharge that disintegrates the flesh of its target. Their language is called Sycoraxic. The Sycorax also appear to have technology that is either disguised or treated as magic, referring to "curses" and the Doctor's regenerative abilities as "witchcraft". The Sycorax leader referred to an "armada" that they could use to take Earth by force if their blood control plan failed. They also appear to have a martial society, with traditions of honourable combat, yet they have no qualms about killing prisoners.

According to a write-up by [[Russell T Davies]] on the BBC website,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/confidential/x/sycorax.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; the Sycorax facial structure was inspired by the skull of a horse. According to the same write-up, the Sycorax originated on an asteroid in the distant JX82 system, known as the Fire Trap. They were [[Biological uplift|uplifted]] when a spaceship crashed on their asteroid and the Sycorax Leader enslaved the survivors, forcing the aliens to teach them about their technology. The asteroid was then retrofitted into the first of many spaceships, which the Sycorax then used to raid other planets, becoming feared interstellar scavengers. This reputation is made clear in their attitude to other 'inferior' races. The Sycorax leader comments to Rose that he would not 'dirty his tongue' with her language, and their translated word for 'human' can also be taken to mean 'cattle'. Their armada is permanently in orbit around the Jewel of Staa Crafell.

In ''The Doctor Who Files'' books, the name of the Sycorax homeworld is given as "Sycorax". It is unclear if this is another name for the Fire Trap. Furthermore, after the destruction of the Fire Trap, the Sycorax spread further through the galaxy, and like humans are one of three species that continually survive and adapt, even unto the End of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Starships And Spacestations 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The name [[Sycorax]] is used in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''. Shakespeare's Sycorax has died before the play begins; she is described as a witch who was the mother of the beast [[Caliban]]. The Shakespearean name is referenced in the third series episode "[[The Shakespeare Code]]" when the Doctor finds a horse's skull in The Globe's prop cupboard. He comments that it "Reminds [him] too much of the Sycorax". Shakespeare remarks he likes the sound of the word, obviously then going on to use it in ''[[The Tempest]]''.

The [[Sycorax]] also make a brief appearance in "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" (2010) as part of The Alliance formed to trap the Doctor.  Later, in "[[The Name of the Doctor]]" (2013), the Great Intelligence mentions them as one of those that left the Doctor blood-soaked.

In issue #1 of the IDW published Doctor Who comic book, a Sycorax is collecting near-extinct species to use with shape-shifters for expensive hunts. The Sycorax race also make a return in the [[Tenth Doctor]] comic strip "The Widow's Curse", in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' #395. The DWM comic story is the first appearance of female Sycorax, who seem to operate separately from the males.

In the audio series ''[[Doctor Who: Classic Doctors, New Monsters|Classic Doctors, New Monsters]]'', the [[Seventh Doctor]] faces the Sycorax in the audio "Harvest of the Sycorax", where he has to stop their efforts to take control of a space station that contains blood samples taken from virtually the entire human race of the far future.

The '''Tenza''' are an alien species that has their young raised by other species. Put simply, "a Tenza's sole function is to fit in." They adapt perfectly to what their foster parents want, such as "George" becoming the son Claire was unable to give birth to. Tenzas have powerful psychic abilities such being able to create monsters with just their imagination, as well as mentally creating massive perception filters that alter their foster parents' memories. Since George didn't seem aware of his nature as a Tenza, the young of his species must do these things subconsciously or simply forget their true identities to blend in perfectly. The Doctor has said that Tenza puberty is "always a funny time", and said he might be back to deal with George again if something else goes awry.

The '''Terileptils''' appeared in the [[Fifth Doctor]] serial ''[[The Visitation (Doctor Who)|The Visitation]]'' by [[Eric Saward]]. They are a [[reptilian humanoid]] species, they cannot survive long without breathing soliton gas, which is highly combustible when combined with oxygen. As an advanced society, they enjoy a heightened appreciation of both aesthetics and warfare, and have been known to employ bejewelled [[android (robot)|androids]]. Criminal punishment in Terileptil society includes life imprisonment working in tinclavic mines on the planet Raaga, often with sub-standard medical care.

In 1666, a group of Terileptil prison escapees hidden near London attempted to use a genetically enhanced version of the [[Black Plague]] to destroy humanity. The destruction of their lab in Pudding Lane caused the [[Great Fire of London]].

The Terileptils destroyed the [[Sonic screwdriver]] which did not appear again until the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|''Doctor Who'' TV movie]].

The Terileptils are mentioned as being part of The Alliance formed to trap the Doctor in "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" (2010).  They were also present during the [[The Time of the Doctor|siege of Trenzalore]]. A Terileptil is briefly shown as one of the criminals displayed by Psi in "[[Time Heist]]" (2014).

According to the [[Virgin Missing Adventures]] novel ''The Dark Path'' by [[David A. McIntee]], by the 34th century, their homeworld Terileptus is a member of the Galactic Federation, and a noted builder of starships. A Terileptil also appears as the chief engineer on a Federation starship. The planet is destroyed during the events described in the novel.

The '''Tetraps''' are a [[bat]]-like race from the planet Tetrapyriarbus. A pack of Tetraps was employed by [[The Rani (Doctor Who)|the Rani]] to help defend her [[List of Doctor Who items#G|Giant Brain]] in the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s debut story, ''[[Time and the Rani]]'' (1987) by [[Pip and Jane Baker]]. The Rani armed a pack of Tetraps for this purpose and used them as general henchmen to terrorise the native Lakertyans.

Tetraps have four eyes, one on each side of their head, giving them all-round vision, and put this to good use in stalking fugitives. Like bats, they sleep by hanging upside-down in a cavern. They feed off a dark red-coloured sludge that the Lakertyan leader releases down a chute into a trough.

Tetraps possess limited intelligence, but they soon realise that the Rani's plans would have them all killed on [[List of Doctor Who planets#L|Lakertya]]. This is confirmed when their leader, Urak, hears of her plans and she later leaves him to guard over her laboratory rather than take him with her in her [[TARDIS]], thus condemning him to death. Urak and the enraged Tetraps capture the Rani in her ship and take her back to their home planet, to force her to help solve their natural resource shortages.

}}
The '''Time Beetle'''&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode accompanying "Turn Left", [[Russell T Davies]] stated that the production team refer to it as the Time Beetle.&lt;/ref&gt; is a member of the ''Trickster's Brigade'', a group of aliens that serve [[#The Trickster|the Trickster]]. The Time Beetle, similar to the Trickster himself, feeds on time energy and can cause a victim to change a decision they made in the past, thereby altering history. The change in history is usually very minor, affecting only the person the beetle attaches to, and the universe usually "compensates" for the discrepancy.

When the beetle attaches to Donna in "[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]" (2008), instead of compensating it creates a "great big parallel world" where Donna never meets the Doctor, resulting in disaster for Earth. The Doctor, Martha Jones, Sarah Jane Smith, and Torchwood staff [[Ianto Jones]] and [[Gwen Cooper]] were all killed, the city of London was completely destroyed when the ''Titanic'' crashes into Buckingham Palace, Captain [[Jack Harkness]] is taken to the Sontaran homeworld, and millions of people die from threats the Doctor would have otherwise prevented. Donna travels back in time to make her make the original decision that leads to her meeting the Doctor, killing the Beetle. According to both the Doctor and Donna, this universe ceased to exist.

In an accompanying "Monster Files" episode, Captain Jack raised doubts over whether the whole of the Trickster's Brigade consists of beetles, suggesting all individuals are of different species.

In the ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode "[[Immortal Sins]]" (2011), the ''Trickster's Brigade'' is mentioned as they attempt to cause the victory of [[Nazi Germany]] by assassinating [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] through a parasite.

===Time Lord===
{{Main|Time Lord}}
{{See also|Doctor (Doctor Who)}}
The '''Time Lords''' are a race of humanoid aliens to which [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], among other characters, belongs. Time Lords have the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] when mortally wounded. This process creates for them an entirely new body and results in major changes in personality, but retains the Time Lord's memories and identity. It is suggested in ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'' (1966) that some detectable feature is retained, as the [[Dalek]]s are immediately able to recognize the [[Second Doctor]], even though he has just regenerated. During "[[The Time of the Doctor]]" (2013), it was confirmed by the [[Eleventh Doctor]] that a Time-Lord, naturally, is only allowed 12 regenerations, resulting in 13 different incarnations. In the same episode, the Doctor saves [[Clara Oswald|Clara's]] life by sending her home to her own time, but in protest she clings to the [[TARDIS]] through the Time Vortex on its return. Upon arriving 300 years later, she finds a visibly aged Doctor, proving that Time Lords experience natural physical changes during each lifespan between regenerations. In the episode "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]" (2011), it is suggested this ability evolved due to the Time Lord race's long-term exposure to the untempered schism.

Time Lords exhibit various other superhuman abilities, including certain [[Time Lord#Mental powers|mental powers]], and resistance to otherwise harmful effects such as extreme cold and radiation. They possess a binary vascular system (two hearts), and therefore a faster heart rate, as well as a cooler internal body temperature. The Doctor would later claim that Time Lords came before humans did in "[[The Beast Below]]" (2010).

The first Time Lord to appear other than the Doctor and his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] is [[The Monk (Doctor Who)|the Monk]], in the 1965 serial ''[[The Time Meddler]]'', but the term itself is not used until ''[[The War Games]]'' (1969), when the race as a whole is introduced.

As of the 2005 revival series, the Time Lords are essentially extinct, apart from the Doctor, as they have been destroyed by him during [[Time War (Doctor Who)|the Time War]]. However, "[[The Day of the Doctor]]" (2013) shows that this was a ruse; the Time Lords are still alive in pocket universe, where everyone one of the Doctors put them to save them from destruction.

===Time Zombies===
Creatures that appeared in "[[Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS]]" (2013). They are echoes of the possible future selves that the Doctor, Clara, Trickey and Gregor would have become from being exposed to the Eye of Harmony too long; they were burnt by it as their cells liquified. It appeared that they lacked most of their former intelligence, along with the ability to speak. However, each may have been driven by a particular motive - the Doctor wanted the part of the Arch Rec back from Gregor, Clara could have wanted revenge on the Van Baalens for being the cause of all the trouble, and Gregor and Tricky would want revenge for being mutated into a monster. Each could be identitified, although not as easily with the Doctor and Clara, because of how they changed; the Doctor is stuck holding his head, and the Van Baalens are stuck to each other.

Unlike the other time echoes, they could touch the present world, and killed Bram Van Baalen. They end up trapping their past selves in the Eye of Harmony's room by accident, setting up the existence of the Time Zombies. The Doctor realised how to avert the future, killing all but Clara's echo by knocking them off the rail. However, the Van Baalens couldn't avoid their fate. The Doctor eventually prevented the existence of these things by resetting time, preventing the TARDIS from being damaged and salvaged by the Van Baalen Brothers.

The '''Tivolians''' are a cowardly rodent-faced race that live on Tivoli, the most invaded planet in the galaxy. As a result, they have designed their cities to be comfortable for invading armies and their national anthem is "Glory To &lt;Insert Name Here&gt;". They are known for surrendering as soon as possible, and actually enjoy being conquered. As a result of the natives' cowardly attitudes, the planet Tivoli has lasted longer than any of the greater civilizations. They do not assert their own opinions often, just wishing to be ordered around or enslaved, as seen in the case of Gibbis and Albar Prentis. The [[Twelfth Doctor]] says that Tivolians wouldn't say 'Boo' to a goose—they'd be more likely to give the goose their car keys and bank account information. Among the list of those who ruled the Tivolians are the Fisher King and the "glorious Arcateenians”.

The '''Toclafane'''&lt;ref&gt;Their name has been quoted by [http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/facts/fact_313.shtml Doctor Who Fact Files] on the BBC's website as meaning roughly "Fool the fan", in French. It has actually no meaning in that language.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the last remnants of humanity from the year 100&amp;nbsp;trillion. Originally intending to travel to [[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]], the last refuge of a dying universe, they find nothing but "the dark and the cold" of space. Losing the last shred of hope they had, they turned on themselves, cannibalising their own bodies to create a new cyborg race. As part of this process they regress into little more than children with [[group mind (science fiction)|shared memories]]. The name Toclafane is given to them by [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], who takes it from the [[Gallifrey]]an equivalent of the [[bogeyman]].

The Toclafane's cyborg forms possess energy devices capable of killing and disintegrating targets. They are equipped with numerous retractable blades. The first four to be seen also exhibit apparent teleportation or cloaking abilities, not displayed by others of their race. All that remains of their bodies are barely recognisable human faces wired into basketball-sized mechanical spheres.

In "[[The Sound of Drums]]"/"[[Last of the Time Lords]]" (2007), the Master rescues four Toclafane from the end of the universe prior to an eventual [[Big Freeze]], using them to fake a first contact situation in order to draw the world's leaders into one place for easy capture. He then uses a "[[Paradox Machine|paradox machine]]" to allow the future of the human race to slaughter many in the present, in short bringing the six billion humans that are alive in the year 100&amp;nbsp;trillion to return in the form of the Toclafane. The paradox machine creates a temporal paradox, allowing them to kill their ancestors without damaging themselves, and thus establish the Master's rule over Earth. After subduing Earth, the Master aims to establish a new [[Time Lord]] empire with himself as the leader and the Toclafane as his people and ground troops. This plan is foiled when the paradox machine is destroyed, causing time to rewind and trapping the Toclafane back at the end of the universe.

The Toclafane feature on the cover of the [[New Series Adventures]] novel, ''[[The Story of Martha]]'', which chronicles Martha Jones's adventures during [[Last of the Time Lords|The Year That Never Was]].

A humanoid species, with great intelligence, that live on the peaceful planet of Traken, which is part of the Traken Union. A Keeper is chosen to guard the Source once the life of the current one draws close to ending. Their planet would petrify anything evil that would arrive, until the Keeper's life began waning and thus the petrification would weaken. During ''[[Logopolis]]'' (1981), the Master caused the destruction of the Traken Union and its people by unleashing entropy back into the universe, leaving Nyssa (as far as she or anyone knew) the sole Trakenite in existence.

===Travist Polong===

'''Travist Polong''' is an orange, metre-long, five-eyed [[slug]]/[[slater]]-like alien. Sarah Jane attempted to catch it at a hospital at Tarminster in ''[[The Mark of the Berserker]]'' (2008), but left to deal with a Berserker.

Travist Polong was later delivered to Sarah Jane in ''[[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith]]'' (2009) after she saw it on eBay in its dormant stage. Rani and Clyde took it inside Rani's house, but it escaped. They chased it to 13 Bannerman Road, where they caught it in a garbage can. Sarah Jane directed Rani to order Mr Smith to teleport it to Polongus, its home planet. Sarah Jane described Travist Polong as "not evil, just trouble".

===The Trickster===
'''The Trickster''' is a being beyond the universe which seeks to manifest itself through causing chaos. It can interfere in deaths, by making deceptive deals to prolong life at a price. It can only exist within the universe for brief periods, without physical form, sometimes in a mirror or other reflective surface. It is a member of the Pantheon of Discord. Played by [[Paul Marc Davis]], the Trickster is a recurring nemesis in ''The Sarah Jane Adventures''. Though the character does not directly appear in the series' related programmes (parent show ''Doctor Who'' and adult sister show ''[[Torchwood]]''), the Trickster's attempts to change history have nevertheless been depicted.

In ''[[Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?]]'', in order to create chaos of sufficient magnitude, the Trickster removed Sarah Jane from history so that an asteroid that only she could have stopped would hit the Earth. The Trickster altered an incident in Sarah Jane's childhood in 1964 that originally led to the death of her best friend Andrea. The Trickster switched the places of the two girls after gaining Andrea's consent, creating a timeline in which Sarah Jane died at age 13. Preferring a meaningless destruction of Earth rather than for profit or military conquest, the Trickster also influenced the various alien threats Sarah Jane had faced on Earth to stay away from the planet, creating a peaceful timeline up until the impending asteroid strike. Keeping Sarah Jane in [[Limbo]], it further planned to use her to find and remove the Doctor from history, which would create a timeline of diabolical chaos, wherein the many tragedies the Doctor averted would have instead proceeded.

The [[#Time Beetle|Time Beetle]] that consumes time energy by changing an individual's personal timeline in the ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]" is described in the episode as one of "[[#The Trickster's Brigade|the Trickster's Brigade]]".

In ''[[The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith]]'', the Trickster returned with the [[Graske]]. It manifested in 1951 after Sarah Jane saved her parents' lives. By 2008 it had completely devastated the planet and enslaved the human population, and was working on conquering other planets. Sarah Jane returned to the point of his manifestation in an attempt to stop him, but could not think of a suitable method. Her parents willingly drive off in their car, leading to their death, causing the Trickster to vanish and the original time to be restored. The Trickster materialised through the Abbott's Gate at the old monastery in Sarah Jane's home village of Foxgrove. This entry point was razed for the construction of an [[Great Britain road numbering scheme#A roads|A road]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Smith states the history of Foxgrove to Sarah Jane at her request in ''[[The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trickster returned in ''[[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith]]'', having made a deal with lawyer Peter Dalton after an accident at home, granting Dalton his life and the love he never had, Sarah Jane Smith. Sarah Jane fell in love with Dalton, and agreed to marry him, but the wedding was interrupted by the arrival of the [[Tenth Doctor|Doctor]]. The Trickster took the hotel out of time, trapping Sarah Jane and Peter in one second while the Doctor, K9, Luke, Clyde and Rani were trapped in another. Realising that the Trickster intended for Sarah's marriage to end her life of defending the Earth, Sarah Jane convinced Peter that he must break the deal, sacrificing himself so that Sarah Jane could continue to save the world. The Trickster made reference to the Tenth Doctor's future [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] and added that the Doctor's first meeting with the Pantheon of Discord had sent ripples back through time. The Trickster was revealed to be vulnerable to artron energy (the power source of the [[TARDIS]]). Clyde became charged with artron energy when he came in contact with the TARDIS while it was attempting to penetrate the Trickster's time rift. He was able to use the energy to harm the Trickster, draining its energy long enough for the Doctor to penetrate the Trickster's temporal trap.

The Trickster is briefly referenced in the ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]'' episode "[[Immortal Sins]]". In the episode, [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] and his lover/companion [[List of Torchwood characters#Angelo Colasanto|Angelo Colasanto]] intercept and destroy an alien parasite that the Trickster's brigade had planned to use to infect U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and create an alternate timeline where [[Nazi Germany]] won [[World War II]].

A shot of the Trickster is briefly shown in the 2014 ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[Time Heist]]", describing him as one of many of the galaxy's most notorious criminals. Considering he desires nothing but chaos, the Trickster is likely ''the'' most wanted criminal.

===The Trickster's Brigade===
'''The Trickster's Brigade''' serve the recurring ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' villain, [[#The Trickster|the Trickster]]. They also feed on chaos in time as the Trickster does. In "[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]", a [[#Time Beetle|Time Beetle]], a member of ''The Trickster's Brigade'', attaches itself onto the back of companion [[Donna Noble]], creating a parallel world where she never met the Doctor in "[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]", leading to his death.

In the ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode "[[Immortal Sins]]", [[Jack Harkness]] and [[List of Torchwood characters#Angelo Colasanto|Angelo Colasanto]] discover that ''The Trickster's Brigade'' plans to cause the victory of [[Nazi Germany]] by assassinating [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] with the use of a [[List of Torchwood creatures and aliens#Brain Parasite|brain parasite]] but Jack shoots it in the head, killing it instantly.

===Trion===

A humanoid species, with no visible differences from humans, Trions are quite intelligent. A civil war broke out on the planet, and those on the wrong side were banished to different planets, Turlough ended up on Earth, while the rest of his family ended up on a volcanic planet. The descendants of the original exiles came to believe the mark of exile meant those who had it were chosen by their god, Mulkur, to lead them. After several years past, the exile was lifted from those banished from the planet, allowing them back home.

The '''Usurians''' from the planet [[Utopia (Doctor Who place)|Usurius]] are a species that abandoned military conquest in favour of economic conquest. They enslaved humanity after their engineers made [[Malcassario|Mars]] suitable for human habitation, humans having depleted the [[List of Doctor Who planets#E|Earth's]] resources. Once humanity had depleted Mars's resources as well, the Usurians engineered [[Peladon|Pluto]] so that humans could inhabit it. They created six artificial "Suns" around it and installed [[List of Doctor Who villains#The Collector|the Collector]] to oversee the collection of taxes from their human workforce. They intended to abandon Pluto and leave humanity to become extinct once the humans had exhausted its resources, there being no economically viable planet to relocate humanity to once more. The humans on Pluto revolted against the Collector and seized control of Pluto. The revolutionaries intended to relocate to Earth as the [[Fourth Doctor|Doctor]] assured them it would have regenerated in their absence.

The Usurians have knowledge of the [[Time Lords]], graded as "Grade 3" in their "latest market survey", considering [[Gallifrey]] to be of low commercial value. Usurians can adopt a [[humanoid]] form but in their natural state they resemble [[seaweed]]. Shock can force them to revert to their natural form. According to the Doctor, Usurians are listed in a "flora and fauna" of the universe written by a Professor Thripthead under poisonous fungi.

===Uvodni===

The '''Uvodni''' is a bug-like race, first introduced in ''[[Warriors of Kudlak]]'' (2007). [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#General Kudlak|General Kudlak]] served in his race's military until injuries forced him to retire. In order to gain more troops for his race's continuing war effort, Kudlak was dispatched to Earth. He seized control of the Combat 3000 laser game franchise, which he secretly used to find human children with strong combat skills. These children were teleported to Kudlak's orbiting spaceship and dispatched to fight in his race's war. Kudlak took orders from a battle computer that used the image of a female of his race as an avatar, which he referred to as "Mistress". An error left the computer unable to comprehend the concept of the war ending, so it withheld from Kudlak an announcement of peace from his emperor for over a decade. When this fact was revealed, by intervention of Luke Smith's computer hacking, Kudlak destroyed the computer. He then dedicated his life to finding and returning the already dispatched human children, hoping to gain inner peace by doing so.

An Uvodni appeared in "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" (2010) as part of the Alliance formed to trap the Doctor.

The Uvodni are mentioned in the audio book ''The White Wolf'', when Ben remarks that the Uvodni could have helped them get home.

The Uvodni are mentioned in the audio book ''[[Wraith World]]'', when [[Clyde Langer]] remarks he cannot understand why [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke]] and [[Rani Chandra (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Rani]] would want to read about made up adventures, when they have faced Uvodni.

Living metal created by the Time Lords, capable of many tasks due to its origins. Such metal ended up on Earth and Lady Peinforte used it to make a statue of herself, the Nemesis Statue. The Doctor, through his various incarnations, sent the statue off Earth every 25 years, only for it to return, due to the bow and arrow being missing and thus draw the statue back; every great disaster in Earth's history that's 25 years apart was caused by it.

In 1988, the Doctor was able to recover all the pieces and have the statue explode in the middle of a Cyberman fleet.

===Vampire===
A number of different types of vampire have appeared in televised Doctor Who:
* In the fourth episode of the 1965 [[First Doctor]] serial ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]'', the [[First Doctor]], [[Ian Chesterton|Ian]], [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara]] and [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] encounter [[Count Dracula]] and [[Frankenstein's Monster]], who make short work of a pursuing party of [[Dalek]]s. The Doctor speculates that the monsters and the haunted mansion that they inhabit are the products of [[nightmare]]s created from the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. As the [[TARDIS]] and the Daleks' time capsule leave, it is revealed that the monsters are in fact funfair robots.
* The [[Fourth Doctor]] encounters [[vampire]]s whilst travelling in E-Space in the 1980 serial ''[[State of Decay]]''. The Doctor, [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]], [[Adric]] and [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] encounter three vampires, Aukon, Camilla and Zargo. It is revealed that the three are servants of the giant King Vampire who once fought a great war against the [[Time Lord]]s but was the sole survivor of the war by escaping to E-Space. The Doctor defeats the King Vampire by launching the lesser vampires' tower—actually the command module of the ship piloted by the originally human trio – and using it as a stake to pierce the giant vampire's heart. The three servant vampires perish along with their king.
* Creatures similar to vampires, [[#Saturnyn|Saturnyns]], appeared in the [[Eleventh Doctor]] episode "[[The Vampires of Venice]]".

Vampires have also appeared in ''Doctor Who'' stories in other media. Vampires related to the Great Vampires seen in ''State of Decay'' are featured prominently in the Virgin New Adventures novel ''[[Blood Harvest]]'', the Missing Adventure ''[[Goth Opera]]'', the BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures novel ''[[Vampire Science]]'', and the Big Finish Productions audio dramas ''[[Project Twilight|Project: Twilight]]'' and ''[[Project Lazarus|Project: Lazarus]]''. The Eighth Doctor Adventure ''[[The Eight Doctors]]'' also features them in a flashback to ''State of Decay''; in addition, the war between the vampires and the Time Lords is a significant plot element in the New Adventure ''[[Damaged Goods (Doctor Who novel)|Damaged Goods]]''. Other vampires or vampire-like creatures have been featured in the Missing Adventure ''[[Managra]]'', the audio drama ''[[UNIT: Snake Head]]'', the BBCi webcast ''[[Death Comes to Time]]'', the short story ''The Feast of the Stone'' (featuring [[Shalka Doctor|an alternate Ninth Doctor]]), the ''[[Bernice Summerfield]]'' anthology ''[[The Vampire Curse]]'', and the ''[[Torchwood]]'' website.

Vampires also featured in the Big Finish Doctor Who 40th anniversary story ''[[Zagreus (audio drama)|Zagreus]]''. Here an account is given that the Vampires originally fed on mindless creatures they bred themselves, until the Time Lords attacking them forced them to feed on sentient species. It is also claimed here that Rassilon developed regeneration from the Vampires.

===Varga Plant===
{{Doctor Who race
|name=Varga Plants
|type=Animal/plant hybrid
|affiliation=[[Dalek]]s
|planet=Skaro
|start="[[Mission to the Unknown]]" (1965)
}}
The '''Varga Plants''' (sometimes '''Vaarga''') appeared in the [[First Doctor]] episode "[[Mission to the Unknown]]" and the serial ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'' (1965–66), which were essentially a prologue and main epic respectively. They were created by [[Terry Nation]].

Varga Plants grew naturally on the Daleks' homeworld, [[Skaro]], and when the Daleks set up a base on the planet Kembel they brought some Varga plants with them to act as sentries in the jungle surrounding their base. They were suited to this as they could move around freely by dragging themselves along with their roots.

Varga plants resemble [[Cactus|cacti]]; they are covered in fur and thorns. Anyone pricked by a Varga thorn will be consumed by the urge to kill, while simultaneously becoming a Varga plant themself. This grisly fate befell astronauts Jeff Garvey and Gordon Lowery, and their commander, Marc Cory, was forced to kill them.

The plants later made an appearance in the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio ''[[I, Davros: Purity]]''. In this, it was revealed that the Varga plants were one of the oldest species on Skaro, but for most of their history had been immobile. Since the start of the Kaled-Thal war however, exposure to radiation and chemical weapons had caused them to rapidly evolve into a much deadlier form, capable of self-locomotion. It was this discovery that caused [[Davros]] to become interested in genetically engineering creatures in order to create weapons of war. In ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Dalek Empire II: Dalek War|Dalek Empire II: Dalek War]]'', they were found on a terraformed Jupiter where they infected earth troops. They appeared in ''[[Doctor Who: The Adventure Games|City of the Daleks]]'' where after the Time War they infested the ruined Dalek city of Kaalann on Skaro but here their appearance was much different.

===Varosian===
{{Main|Vengeance on Varos}}

Varosians are the descendants of prisoners that were kept on the planet, though the truth of this has faded with time, with only a few knowing the truth.

===Vashta Nerada===
{{Doctor Who race
|name=Vashta Nerada
|type=Carnivorous swarm
|affiliation=Unknown
|planet= Practically universal
|start="[[Silence in the Library]]"
}}
{{Main|Silence in the Library|Forest of the Dead}}
Vashta Nerada (literally: the shadows that melt the flesh) are microscopic swarm creatures which, when present in a high enough concentration, are indistinguishable from shadows, and use this to their advantage in approaching and attacking prey. They are described as the "[[piranha]]s of the air", able to strip their victims to the bone in an instant in high enough densities. The Doctor says that almost every planet in the universe has some, including [[Earth]], and claims that they can be seen as the specks of dust visible in bright light. He states they are the reason most sentient creatures have an instinctual fear of the dark. On most planets, however, Vashta Nerada exist in relatively low concentrations, feeding primarily on [[carrion]], with attacks on people being comparatively rare. In the episode "[[Silence in the Library]]", an unusually high concentration of Vashta Nerada had completely overrun the 51st-century "Library", resulting in the apparent death of everyone inside at the time.

Vashta Nerada normally live in forested areas, and reproduce by means of microscopic spores which can lie dormant in wood pulp. In the episode "[[Forest of the Dead]]", this is revealed to be the reason for their unusual prevalence in The Library, as it is made known that the books and The Library itself was constructed of wood from the Vashta Nerada's native forest feeding grounds. Individually, Vashta Nerada are non-sentient, but if a large enough concentration come together, they can form a group mind of human-level intelligence capable of communication.

The fourth episode of ''[[Doctor Who: The Adventure Games]]'', "Shadows of the Vashta Nerada", features them as the leading villain when a temporal rift draws a swam of Vashta Nerada to an underwater base that is being visited by the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[Amy Pond]].

The Vashta Nerada appear in the second volume of the [[Big Finish Productions]] audio ''[[Doctor Who: Classic Doctors, New Monsters|Classic Doctors, New Monsters]]''; "Night of the Vashta Nerada" sees the [[Fourth Doctor]] visiting a theme park that has unleashed the local Vashta Nerada after the planet's forests were torn down to allow the park to be constructed, and "Day of the Vashta Nerada" pits the [[Eighth Doctor]] against genetically-altered Vashta Nerada that have been created as a new weapon in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]].

===Veil===
'''Veils''' are able to step into the bodies of others, controlling them. They can also induce a trance by touching their victims. This can be done with their extremely long tongue. In the episode, ''[[Prisoner of the Judoon]]'', [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#Androvax|Androvax]], the last Veil, was a fugitive responsible for destroying twelve planets, and was pursued by the [[Judoon]] after the Judoon prison ship containing him crashed on Earth. He then returned on the episode ''[[The Vault of Secrets]]'', seeking help from Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani due to the fact that he was ill and wanted to return to his own kind. Androvax was successful in awakening the survivors of the Veils as he searches for a new world for them to reside in.

In "[[Heaven Sent (Doctor Who)|Heaven Sent]],"  the Twelfth Doctor encountered another creature that is also called the Veil while trapped in his Confession Dial. The creature modeled after an image of a rotting female corpse the Doctor saw in his childhood, the Veil's purpose is to force the Doctor to confess what he knew of the Hybrid.

===Venom Grub===
{{Main|The Web Planet}}

===Venusian===
Venusians are inhabitants of the planet [[Venus]], the closest planet to [[Earth]]. They had large feet, and six arms. The [[Third Doctor]] often employed a form of Venusian martial art (called Venusian [[aikido]] or Venusian [[karate]]) and sang Venusian [[lullabies]] (to the tune of ''[[God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen]]''). Venusian aikido is allegedly very hard for two-armed beings to learn. Its use appeared in the serials [[Inferno (Doctor Who)|Inferno]], [[Day of the Daleks]], and others. The [[Seventh Doctor]] favored a more subtle version which involved applying a single finger, seen in ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]].'' The [[Fourth Doctor]] revealed to [[Davros]] in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' that a battle between the Venusians and the Daleks "in the Space Year 17,000" was ended by the intervention of a group of battleships from the planet Hyperon. Although Venus today is utterly devoid of life, the [[Virgin Missing Adventures]] novel ''[[Venusian Lullaby]]'' shows Venus to have been inhabited billions of years ago, before the surface became too hot to support life.

===Vervoid===
[[File:Doctor Who Experience series 10 (36275943691).jpg|thumb|A Vervoid, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition.|alt=]]
{{Main|Terror of the Vervoids}}

Artificially created plant-based humanoids who possess problem-solving intelligence and the power of speech; they were intended to perform tasks usually carried out by robots, but for a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately they instead decided to eradicate all of 'animalkind'. Vervoids had about the size and strength of humans, but were covered in leaves which provided them with energy through photosynthesis. They possessed thorns so poisonous they could kill a human on contact, and could produce copious amounts of methane-based swamp gas.

===Vespiform===
{{Doctor Who race
|name=Vespiform
|type=Morphing insectoids
|planet= Unknown, Silfrax Galaxy
|start="[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]"
}}
{{Main|The Unicorn and the Wasp}}
The Vespiform are an [[insectoid]] species resembling giant [[wasp]]s, born ''en masse'' in hives in the Silfrax Galaxy. Each possesses the ability to morph into other species. It also has the ability to breed with other species, including humans, to produce offspring. The ''Monster Files'' feature establishes them as an ancient race and that they have fought the [[The Dominators|Quark rebels]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC – Doctor Who – Videos – Series Four&lt;/ref&gt;

Vespiform have a telepathic connection to objects called firestones, which contains part of their mind. Like Earth's wasps, the Vespiform are vulnerable to water. A Vespiform-human hybrid can live a normal life as a human until a burst of intense emotion awakens its alien biology. When the Vespiform morphs into another species it emits a purple light.

In "[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]", a Vespiform appears and goes on a killing spree in the style of [[Agatha Christie]]'s murder mystery books. Eventually it turns out the reason for Vespiform's killings was due to his firestone in the possession of Lady Eddison, who was thinking about Christie's novels. Furthermore, the Vespiform is revealed to be Lady Eddison's illegitimate son: Reverend Golightly. In the end, trying to get the firestone back, the Vespiform dies chasing after the item when Donna Noble throws it into a lake.

===The Vigil===
{{main|The Rings of Akhaten}}

===Vinvocci===
{{Main|The End of Time (Doctor Who)}}
The Vinvocci are a race of spiky green aliens who first appeared in ''[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]''. A pair of Vinvocci came to Earth as part of a salvage operation to recover Vinvocci technology—a medical device for healing entire planets, which Joshua Naismith named the "Immortality Gate". They possess disguise technology referred to by the Doctor as a Shimmer. When the Doctor notes a similarity to Bannakaffalatta from ''[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]'', noting the distinction that "he was small, and red", the Vinvocci are quick to differentiate themselves from the Zocci; both races may be at odds with each, explaining the response. They also find it racist when someone calls them cacti.

===Viperox===
{{Main|Dreamland (Doctor Who)}}

[[Insectoid]] creatures that attempted to destroy Earth in 1958, in the Dry Springs of Nevada.

===Visian===
{{Main|The Daleks' Master Plan}}
'''Visians''' are invisible creatures indigenous to the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#M|Mira]]. They are completely invisible, detectable only by their footprints and the sounds they make while moving through the jungle. [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] states that they are 8 feet tall and extremely hostile, evidenced by the fact that they attack both the Doctor's party and the [[Daleks]] indiscriminately.

===Viyrans===

A highly advanced race of creatures which specialise in virus experimentation.  They have featured in the Fifth Doctor Audio Story [[The Mind's Eye &amp; Mission of the Viyrans#Mission of the Viyrans|Mission of the Viyrans]] and the Sixth Doctor Audio Stories [[Patient Zero (audio drama)|Patient Zero]] and [[Blue Forgotten Planet]].  They also appeared in [[Dark Eyes (audio drama)#Dark Eyes 2|Dark Eyes 2]].

===Vogan===
{{Main|Revenge of the Cybermen}}
The natives of the planet Voga, where it was entirely made of gold. The Cybermen sought to destroy their planet,  to hinder the organics' ability to combat them in the Cyber Wars.

===Voord===
{{Main|Voord}}
A race of amphibious humanoids introduced in the [[First Doctor]] serial ''[[The Keys of Marinus]]'' (1964).

===Wallarian===
A race mentioned in ''[[Carnival of Monsters]]'', known for their gambling.

===Weeping Angels===

===Weevil===

===Werewolf===
{{Main|Werewolf (Doctor Who)}}
{{See also|The Greatest Show in the Galaxy|Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|l2=Tooth and Claw}}

Two different kinds of werewolves have appeared in Doctor Who during the series' 50-year run. In The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, a woman named Mag had been found by a [[:wikt:blowhard|blowhard]] explorer on one of his trips; Mag became feral and changed slightly into a more animalistic appearance in moonlight, simulated or real. The Seventh Doctor was able to encourage Mag to regain control of herself, something she wondered she would be able to do again.

In Tooth and Claw, a bacterial life form was worshiped by a religious order, and wanted to establish the Empire of the Wolf by infecting Queen Victoria. The Tenth Doctor was able to destroy it and its host by overloading it with moonlight. However, he suspected that a tiny bit of the lifeform was able to sneak into the Queen through a cut on her finger; the Doctor guessed that the lifeform wouldn't pose a threat until the 21st century.

===Whisper Men===
[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30943593585).jpg|thumb|The Whisper Men as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience|alt=]]
{{main|The Name of the Doctor}}
The '''Whisper Men''' are faceless beings who serve the [[Great Intelligence]]. They dress in Victorian attire and speak in rhyming whispers. Their faces are blank and white except for a mouth full of sharp teeth, and their hands can phase through a person's chest and stop their hearts at will. When the Great Intelligence inhabits one of the Whisper Men, it takes the form of Walter Simeon. The Whisper Men all vanish from existence when the Great Intelligence willingly destroys itself by scattering itself throughout the Doctor's timeline at Trenzalore, the Doctor's final resting place.

===Wirrn===
{{Doctor Who race
|name=Wirrn
|type=Parasitic insectoids
|affiliation=Noah
|planet= "Andromeda"
|start=''[[The Ark in Space]]'' (1975)
}}
The '''Wirrn''' are an [[insectoid]] race that made their debut in the 1975 [[Fourth Doctor]] story ''[[The Ark in Space]]''. The name is sometimes spelled '''Wirrrn''', which is a spelling originating from the novelisation of the story.

The Wirrn claim to have originated from Andromeda (whether they meant the [[Andromeda Galaxy|galaxy]], the [[Andromeda (constellation)|constellation]], or even a planet named "Andromeda" is unclear), but were driven into space by human settlers. They are slightly larger than humans, dark green and wasp-like in appearance, and live mostly in space, although their breeding colonies are terrestrial. Their bodies are a self-contained system, their lungs being able to recycle waste [[carbon dioxide]] and only needing to touch down occasionally on planetary bodies for food and [[oxygen]]. The Wirrn's life cycle involves laying their eggs in living hosts; the larvae emerge to consume the host, absorbing its memories and knowledge. A Wirrn larva is a green slug-like creature, varying in size from a few inches to 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;metres across. It can "infect" another organism through contact with a substance it excretes, mutating them into an adult Wirrn and connecting their consciousness to the hive mind.

In ''The Ark in Space'', the Wirrn found Space Station Nerva in orbit around an Earth devastated centuries before by solar flares. The survivors had lain in [[suspended animation]] waiting for the planet to recover, but had overslept by several millennia. The Wirrn intended to use the sleepers as a food source and claim the empty Earth for their own, as both a means of survival and an act of revenge against the human race for taking their former territories. In the course of their plan, Noah, leader of Nerva, was infected and converted to their kind. However, Noah still retained "more than a vestige of human spirit", probably thanks to the encouragements of the Doctor, and led the Wirrn into Nerva's transport ship even though he knew it was rigged to explode. It did so, ending the Wirrn threat.

The Wirrn have also appeared in the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Placebo Effect (Doctor Who)|Placebo Effect]]'' by [[Gary Russell]], and in the audio play ''Wirrn: Race Memory'', produced by [[BBV]]. [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] used them in the audio stories ''[[Wirrn Dawn]]'' with the Eighth Doctor and ''[[Wirrn Isle]]'' with the Sixth. A dead Wirrn appears briefly in television story ''[[The Stones of Blood]]''.

===Wolfweed===
{{Main|The Creature from the Pit}}

===Wyrrester===
An alien species, which resemble giant scorpions; they appear in the novel ''The Crawling Terror''. According to the Twelfth Doctor, the Wyrresters are warmongers that have ravaged their entire star system; their venom has a hypnotic suggestion effect. Attempting to depart from their star system once it was out of habitable planets, the Wyrresters sent out a message in the 1940s, which was picked up by the Germans and the Allied Forces; the message contained instructions on how to build a teleportation device. Hitler believed it was a super weapon gifted to him by the heavens, but the British scientists knew better. Though the Doctor attempted to stop the experiment, a Wyrrester got through and stung a scientist before being slain by a bombing; this resulted in 70 years of experimentation trying to bring the minds of the Wyrresters to Earth via inhabiting mutated insect bodies. The Doctor's past self arrived to discover the situation, and time traveled to discover what had happened. With the aid of the local military, the Doctor was able to prevent the Wyrresters from teleporting by destroying the device.

===Xeraphin===
{{Doctor Who race
|name=Xeraphin
|type=Gestalt humanoid
|affiliation=[[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]]
|planet=Xeriphas
|start=''[[Time-Flight]]'' (1982)
}}
The '''Xeraphin''' were an ancient species encountered by the [[Fifth Doctor]] in the story ''[[Time-Flight]]'' (1982) by [[Peter Grimwade]]. Originating from the planet Xeriphas, they possessed immense psychokinetic and scientific powers. The Doctor believed the race to have been wiped out during the crossfire during the Vardon/Kosnax war. Instead, the entire race fled to Earth in an escaping spacecraft. The ship crashed near present-day Heathrow some 140 million years ago. When the Xeraphin emerged they built a Citadel to mark their new home but the Xeraphin were so plagued with [[radiation]] that they abandoned their original humanoid bodies and transformed into a single bioplasmic [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] intelligence within a sarcophagus at the heart of the Citadel.

The arrival of [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] coincided with their emergence from the gestalt state when the radiation effects had subsided, and his influence caused the emergence of a split personality of good and evil, each side competing for their tremendous power while yearning to become a proper species once again. The Master, who was stranded on Earth at the time too, succeeded in capturing the Xeraphin as a new power source for his [[TARDIS]]. However, the Doctor's intervention meant his nemesis' TARDIS was sent to Xeriphas where events became out of his control.

Before fleeing Xeriphas and the Xeraphin, the Master took with him [[Kamelion]], a Xeraphin war weapon with advanced shape-changing abilities dependent on the will of its controller. Kamelion was freed from the Master and joined the Doctor's TARDIS crew in ''[[The King's Demons]]'' (1983).

===Xylok===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sarah Jane Smith holds a Xylok (screencap).jpg|thumb|[[Sarah Jane Smith]] carefully holds a Xylok life form.]] --&gt;
{{Main|Mr Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|l1=Mr Smith}}

'''Xyloks''' are a crystalline race that crashed into Earth as a meteorite about 60 million years ago. Consequently, the Xyloks that survived the crash were trapped beneath the surface of the Earth, regrowing over thousands of millennia.

After the eruption of mount [[Krakatoa]] in 1883, one of the Xyloks was found in the post-volcanic aftermath. It was eventually passed to [[Sarah Jane Smith]] by a geologist friend when she was researching volcanic activity, 18 months prior to the events of ''[[The Lost Boy (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Lost Boy]]''. During her studies of the crystalline structure, she found that it could use her laptop to communicate. The Xylok agreed to help Sarah Jane protect Earth, and was integrated into the supercomputer [[Mr Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Mr Smith]], built by Sarah Jane under the instruction of the Xylok. Unbeknownst to Sarah Jane, this was a plot, in anticipation that it would one day be able to release the imprisoned Xylok race. Sarah Jane and her companions were able to thwart its intentions; as a result, Mr Smith was reprogrammed and became a benefit to the human race once again.

===Zanak Humanoid===
{{Main|The Pirate Planet}}

===Zaralok===
{{Main|Doctor Who: The Adventure Games#Shadows of the Vashta Nerada}}
The '''Zaralok''' was a shark-like creature that prowled the waters around the flooded 23rd-century London, now little more than a network of underwater tunnels codenamed 'Poseidon'. When the Doctor and Amy land the [[TARDIS]] in Poseidon, the Zaralok immediately attacks, attempting to ram its way into the glass tunnels. While constantly having to evade the monster, the two slowly unravell the mystery of Poseidon, which has fallen under threat from not only the Zaralok, but also the [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Vashta Nerada|Vashta Nerada]] and otherworldly radiation. They eventually discover that all the anomalies arrived at the city when the [[USS Eldridge]], an American WWII-era ship which had vanished through a wormhole to another world hundreds of years ago, suddenly jumped back through into the sea several days ago. However, the ship became lodged in the wormhole and held it open, allowing the creatures and the radiation to seep through. The Doctor and Amy travel to the wreckage of the Eldridge and are able to close the wormhole; the Zaralok is seen being dragged back to its own world, while the other anomalies disappear with it. The name of the creature is probably derived from ''Žralok'', a shark in [[Slovak language|Slovak]] or [[Czech language]].

===Zarbi===
{{Doctor Who race
|name=Zarbi
|type=Insectoid
|affiliation=Animus
|planet=[[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]]
|start=''[[The Web Planet]]''
}}
The '''Zarbi''' appeared in the 1965 [[First Doctor]] story ''[[The Web Planet]]'' written by [[Bill Strutton]], and are an [[ant]]-like insectoid species, with some characteristics associated with [[beetle]]s, from the planet [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]], which were controlled by the power of the [[Animus (Doctor Who)|Animus]]. They are roughly eight feet long, and the [[Menoptra]] claim that they are "little more than cattle".

They possess little [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] but were not at all aggressive until the Animus arrived. They were enslaved to the alien [[consciousness]] and considered the [[butterfly]]-like Menoptra their mortal enemies. Only they could control the [[woodlouse]]-like venom grubs, also known as larvae guns.

They returned to their normal ways after the Animus was defeated by the [[First Doctor]], [[Ian Chesterton]], [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] and [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]]. It is presumed that the various species on Vortis are now living peacefully together.

A Zarbi and a Menoptra were shown on cover of the first edition of ''Doctor Who Annual'' in September 1965 along with two other ''Doctor Who'' alien races, a [[Voord]] and a [[Sensorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doctor Who: The Sixties|author=[[David J.

{{See also|The End of Time (Doctor Who)}}
The Zocci are a diminutive race of red spiked aliens. ''[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]'' featured a Zocci named Bannakaffalatta. His species was first named in ''[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]'', where the Vinvocci are quick to differentiate themselves from the Zocci.

===Zolfa-Thuran===
A race of intelligent [[cacti]] from the planet Zolfa-Thura.  Meglos, from the [[Meglos|episode of the same name]], was the last surviving member of the species.

'''Nazir Mustafa Karamagi''' (born December 13, 1953) is a [[Tanzania]]n politician and a [[List of Tanzania National Assembly members|Member of Parliament]] in the [[National Assembly of Tanzania]], representing Bukoba Vijijini constituency.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://www.parliament.go.tz/bunge/Mp_Cv3.asp?PTerm=2005-2010&amp;fpkey=295 CV at Parliament website].&lt;/ref&gt;

Karamagi has been a member of the National Executive Council of the [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM) since 2002.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; He was appointed Minister of Industry, Trade and Marketing in the Cabinet named on January 4, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan Muhiddin, [http://www.ippmedia.com/ipp/guardian/2006/01/05/57238.html "JK’s beefed up team"], ''Guardian'' (IPP Media), January 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He was then moved to the position of Minister of Energy and Minerals on October 15, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ippmedia.com/ipp/guardian/2006/10/16/76527.html "Kikwete reshuffles Cabinet"], ''Guardian'' (IPP Media), October 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; remaining in the latter post until he resigned on February 7, 2008 after being implicated in a scandal regarding a government contract to supply emergency power. His resignation came shortly after Prime Minister [[Edward Lowassa]] resigned for the same reason.&lt;ref name=Follow&gt;[http://www.ippmedia.com/ipp/guardian/2008/02/08/107958.html "...as Karamagi, Msabaha follow suit"], ''Guardian'' (IPP Media), February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karamagi, he took over the Ministry of Energy and Minerals six months after the government had signed the aforementioned contract, which Karamagi said was a deal made in good faith and intended to provide more energy for the country.&lt;ref name=Follow/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">The concept of '''negative and positive [[frequency]]''' can be as simple as a wheel rotating one way or the other way: a ''signed value'' of frequency can indicate both the rate and direction of rotation. The rate is expressed in units such as revolutions (a.k.a. ''cycles'') per second ([[hertz]]) or [[radians per second|radian/second]] (where 1&amp;nbsp;cycle corresponds to 2''π''&amp;nbsp;[[radian]]s).

==Sinusoids==
Let ''ω'' be a nonnegative parameter with units of radians/sec.  Then the angular function (angle vs. time) {{nowrap|−''ωt'' + ''θ''}}, has slope −''ω'', which is called a '''negative frequency'''.  But when the function is used as the argument of a cosine operator, the result is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' − ''θ'')}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, {{nowrap|sin(−''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' − ''θ'' + ''π'')}}.  Thus any [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] can be represented in terms of positive frequencies.  The sign of the underlying phase slope is ambiguous.

[[File:Negative frequency.svg|thumb|right|300px|A negative frequency causes the sin function (violet) to lead the cos (red) by 1/4 cycle.]]
[[File:Unit_circle.svg|thumb|right|300px|The vector {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}} rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/second, and completes a circle every 2''π'' seconds.  The vector {{nowrap|(cos −''t'', sin −''t'')}} rotates in the other direction (not shown).]]
The ambiguity is resolved when the cosine and sine operators can be observed simultaneously, because {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} leads {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} by 1/4 cycle (= ''π''/2 radians) when {{nowrap|''ω'' &gt; 0}}, and lags by 1/4 cycle when {{nowrap|''ω'' &lt; 0}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, a vector, {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}}, rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/sec, and completes a circle every 2π seconds, and the vector {{nowrap|(cos −t, sin −t)}} rotates in the other direction.

The sign of ''ω'' is also preserved in the [[complex-valued function]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t} = \underbrace{\cos(\omega t)}_{R(t)} + i\cdot \underbrace{\sin(\omega t)}_{I(t)},&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;The equivalence is called [[Euler's formula]]&lt;/ref&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}

since R(''t'') and I(''t'') can be separately extracted and compared.  Although &lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; clearly contains more information than either of its components, a common interpretation is that it is a simpler function, because:
* It simplifies many important [[Euler's formula#Relationship to trigonometry|trigonometric calculations]], which leads to its formal description as the [[analytic signal|analytic representation]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See {{section link|Euler's formula|Relationship to trigonometry}} and {{section link|Phasor|Addition}} for examples of calculations simplified by the complex representation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A corollary of {{EquationNote|Eq.1}} is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t) = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\left(e^{i \omega t} + e^{-i \omega t}\right),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}
which gives rise to the interpretation that cos(''ωt'') comprises ''both'' positive and negative frequencies.&amp;nbsp; But the sum is actually a cancellation that contains less, not more, information.  Any measure that indicates both frequencies includes a false positive, because ''ω'' can have only one sign.&lt;ref&gt;Conversely, any measure that indicates only one frequency has made an assumption, perhaps based on collateral information.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;  The [[Fourier transform]], for instance, merely tells us that cos(''ωt'') correlates equally well with both {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') + ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}} and with {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') − ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Applications==

Perhaps the most well-known application of negative frequency is the calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;X(\omega) = \int_{a}^{b} x(t)\cdot e^{-i\omega t} dt,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a measure of the amount of frequency ω in the function ''x''(''t'') over the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}.  When evaluated as a continuous function of ''ω'' for the theoretical interval {{nowrap|(−∞, ∞)}}, it is known as the [[Fourier transform]] of ''x''(''t'').  A brief explanation is that the product of two complex sinusoids is also a complex sinusoid whose frequency is the sum of the original frequencies.  So when ''ω'' is positive, &lt;math&gt;e^{-i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; causes all the frequencies of ''x''(''t'') to be reduced by amount ''ω''.  Whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency ''ω'' is changed to frequency zero, which is just a constant whose amplitude level is a measure of the strength of the original ''ω'' content.  And whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency zero is changed to a sinusoid at frequency −''ω''.  Similarly, all other frequencies are changed to non-zero values.  As the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} increases, the contribution of the constant term grows in proportion.  But the contributions of the sinusoidal terms only oscillate around zero.  So ''X''(''ω'') improves as a relative measure of the amount of frequency ''ω'' in the function ''x''(''t'').

The [[Fourier transform]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; produces a non-zero response only at frequency ''ω''.  The transform of &lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; has responses at both ''ω'' and −''ω'', as anticipated by {{EquationNote|Eq.2}}.

==Sampling of positive and negative frequencies and aliasing==
{{Main article|Aliasing#Complex sinusoids}}
[[File:Aliasing between a positive and a negative frequency.png|frame|left|This figure depicts two complex sinusoids, colored gold and cyan, that fit the same sets of real and imaginary sample points.  They are thus aliases of each other when sampled at the rate (''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') indicated by the grid lines.  The gold-colored function depicts a positive frequency, because its real part (the cos function) leads its imaginary part by 1/4 of one cycle.  The cyan function depicts a negative frequency, because its real part lags the imaginary part.]]

'''Nuclear power in the European Union''' accounted for approximately 15% of total energy consumption in 2005. The energy policies of the [[European Union]] (EU) member countries vary significantly. As of January 2010, 14&amp;nbsp;out of 27 countries have [[nuclear reactor]]s. The countries with reactors are: [[Nuclear power in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Nuclear power in Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Nuclear power in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[Nuclear power in Finland|Finland]], [[Nuclear power in France|France]], [[Nuclear power in Germany|Germany]], [[Nuclear power in Hungary|Hungary]], [[Nuclear power in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Nuclear power in Romania|Romania]], [[Nuclear power in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Nuclear power in Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[Nuclear power in Spain|Spain]], [[Nuclear power in Sweden|Sweden]], and the [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=uic1&gt;

==Stress tests==
Stress tests were developed within the [[European Union|EU]] in the aftermath of the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], with the goal of making all 132 operating European reactors follow the same safety standards and have the same safety level for a list of possible catastrophical events (e.g. earthquake, flooding or plane crash). Most reactors proved well during the tests, with just 4 reactors in 2 countries having less than one hour for reactivating safety systems; however, most reactors will also have to undergo a program of safety upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52012DC0571 COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on the comprehensive risk and safety assessments ("stress tests") of nuclear power plants in the European Union and related activities /* COM/2012/0571 final */]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the costs of additional safety improvements were estimated to be in the range of €30 million to €200 million per reactor unit. Thus, the total costs for the 132 reactors operating in the EU could be in the order of €10–25 billion for all NPP units in the EU over the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/safety/doc/com_2012_0571_en.pdf COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on the comprehensive risk and safety assessments ("stress tests") of nuclear power plants in the European Union and related activities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021075436/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/safety/doc/com_2012_0571_en.pdf |date=21 October 2012 }} Brussels, 4.10.2012 page 8 [http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/safety/stress_tests_en.htm Stress tests]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy mix==
The EU-27 in 2005 satisfied its primary energy consumption with 36.7% oil, 24.6% gas, 17.7% coal, 14.2% nuclear, 6.7% [[renewables]] and 0.1% industrial waste.&lt;ref&gt;http://dataservice.eea.europa.eu/atlas/viewdata/viewpub.asp?id=3392{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Esteban&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] provided the largest source (29.5%) of electricity with a production of 990 TWh, and an installed capacity of 134&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Gigawatt|GWe]] (17.6% of all installed capacity). It was the leading electric power source in Belgium, France, Hungary, Lithuania and Slovakia. France, where nuclear is also the largest ''primary'' energy source, produced 450&amp;nbsp;[[TWh]] in 2006 – 45% of the EU's total. Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Austria, Poland and Portugal did not produce any nuclear energy.&lt;ref name = Eurostat_new&gt;

The majority of this growth occurred in the 1990s.

==Uranium resources==
[[File:2009 EU uranium sources.png|thumb|300px|Sources of uranium delivered to EU utilities in 2009, from the [http://ec.europa.eu/euratom/ar/last.pdf 2009 Annual report] of the [[Euratom]] Supply Agency]]
In 2009, only 3% of the [[uranium]] used in European nuclear reactors was [[Uranium mining|mined]] in Europe. Australia, Russia, Canada and Niger were the largest suppliers of nuclear materials to the EU, supplying more than 70% of the total needs in 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/euratom/ar/last.pdf 2009 Annual report of the Euratom Supply Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

==EU-level policy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
European nuclear policy is governed by the [[Euratom Treaty]]. Therefore, regular EU policy on for example [[Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission)|environment]] or the market does not apply to issues in the nuclear field. Nuclear policy is mainly in the competence of the member states. In the EU level, [[Directorate-General for Energy (European Commission)|DG ENER]] is the main authority for EU nuclear issues.

The [[European Council]] is the locus for intergovernmental decisions. The [[European Parliament]] does not have authority in the field of nuclear policy other than the right to ask questions to the European Commission.

In case of a radiological emergency, the EU will trigger its [[ECURIE]] alert system, which immediately notifies all national authorities of an impending nuclear hazard. This system was installed after the experience with the [[Chernobyl disaster]].

The Commission's [[Energy policy of the European Union#SET Plan|SET plan]] mentions the "sustainable nuclear fission initiative" to develop [[Generation IV]] reactors as one of the research priorities of the European Union.

The European Commission is proposing a stress test for all nuclear power plants in Europe, to prove the nuclear fleet can withstand incidents like those in Fukushima.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2011/110159/LDM_BRI(2011)110159_REV2_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission is also proposing tests for countries near the EU that make use of nuclear power.

==Nuclear waste==
On average, the EU creates about 40,000 cubic meters of [[radioactive waste]] per year. Eighty percent of that is short-lived [[low-level radioactive waste]].&lt;ref name=Europa&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; France and the United Kingdom are currently the only EU countries that [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocess waste]]. However, the reprocessing of spent fuel in the UK is being phased out but is expected to continue in France. The countries that currently use this reprocessed fuel ([[MOX]]) include [[Nuclear power in Germany|Germany]], [[Nuclear power in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Nuclear power in France|France]] and [[Nuclear power in Switzerland|Switzerland]].&lt;ref name = cea&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Reprocessing spent fuel significantly decreases its volume and extracts [[plutonium]] from it. Although plutonium is commonly associated with [[nuclear weapons]], the plutonium extracted with reprocessing is not suitable for 'classic' nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite news

The [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]] is financing the [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] of old nuclear plants in [[Nuclear power in Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Nuclear power in Lithuania|Lithuania]] and [[Nuclear power in Slovakia|Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebrd.com/pages/sector/nuclearsafety.shtml Nuclear safety &amp;#91;EBRD – Sector&amp;#93;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026060832/http://www.ebrd.com/pages/sector/nuclearsafety.shtml |date=26 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU memberstates Austria, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Italy, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovenia are working since January 2009 together in the [[European Repository Development Organisation]] (ERDO) to address common issues on nuclear waste storage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erdo-wg.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

ERDO was working early 2010 on a plan to store European nuclear waste somewhere in eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/193361-eastern-europe-nuclear-dustbin |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008073120/http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/193361-eastern-europe-nuclear-dustbin |archive-date=8 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Some 7,000 cubic meters of high-level nuclear waste are produced across the EU each year. Most Member States store spent fuel and other highly radioactive wastes in above-ground storage facilities that need continuous maintenance and oversight and are at risk of accidents, such as airplane crashes, fires or earthquakes. Hungary and Bulgaria currently ship nuclear waste to Russia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2011/2011-07-19-01.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023212111/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2011/2011-07-19-01.html |archivedate=23 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July 2011, the European Commission adopted a Directive for regulating and handling nuclear waste in the EU.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/906&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en&lt;/ref&gt;
"Exports to countries outside the EU is allowed under very strict and binding conditions: The third country needs to have a final repository in operation, when the waste is being shipped. Such a repository for highly radioactive waste is internationally defined to be a deep geological repository. At present, such deep geological repositories do not exist anywhere in the world nor is a repository in construction outside of the EU. It takes currently a minimum of 40 years to develop and build one."&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;

The MAX project (2011 to August 2014), funded partly with an almost €3 million European Commission contribution,&lt;ref&gt;http://ipnwww.in2p3.fr/MAX/index.php/maxproject (see section "Project information")&lt;/ref&gt; embodied working on transmuting the waste into less toxic shorter-lived elements.&lt;ref&gt;http://eucard-old.web.cern.ch/eucard-old/news/newsletters/issue10/article4.html&lt;/ref&gt; The final report from August 2014 is available.&lt;ref&gt;http://ipnwww.in2p3.fr/MAX/images/stories/freedownloads/MAX_Deliverable_1.5_final_free_download.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It concludes that one milestone was not achieved.

==Nuclear decommissioning==
By 2025, it is estimated that over a third of the EU's currently operational reactors will be at the end of their lifecycle and in need of shutdown. At the time of the accession to the EU, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia agreed to shut down reactors at the sites of Kozloduy, Ignalina and Bohunice respectively: these programs are currently under way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/nuclear-energy/decommissioning-nuclear-facilities Decommissioning of nuclear facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; Other decommissioning activities are under way for older reactors, phased out for political reasons (e.g. Italy, Germany) or simply because they reached their end-of-life (e.g. United Kingdom).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/decommissioning-nuclear-facilities.aspx Decommissioning Nuclear Facilities - January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Reuters]] reported that the [[European Commission]] estimated that the EU's [[nuclear decommissioning]] liabilities were seriously underfunded by about 118 billion euros, with only 150 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 268 billion euros of expected decommissioning costs covering both dismantling of nuclear plants and storage of radioactive parts and waste. Among EU member states still operating nuclear plants, only Britain's operators have enough dedicated assets to cover the expected costs, 63 billion euros, the Commission's draft working paper finds. [[Nuclear power in France|France]] had the largest shortfall with only 23 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 74 billion euros of expected costs, while a stress test carried out by Germany’s Economy Ministry late last year showed the provisions made by the country’s utilities – E.ON, RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall [VATN.UL] – were adequate. Decommissioning costs vary according to reactor type and size, location, the proximity and availability of disposal facilities, the intended future use of the site and the condition of the reactor at the time of decommissioning. Although decommissioning might gradually become cheaper, the cost of final waste depositories is largely unknown and costs could also grow, rather than shrink, over the many decades in question. The European Commission declined to comment on an unpublished document and has not confirmed when the report will be officially published.&lt;ref name=reuters-20160216&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-nuclear-idUKKCN0VP2KN |title=EU short of 118 billion euros in nuclear decommissioning funds |author=Christoph Steitz, Barbara Lewis |publisher=Reuters |date=16 February 2016 |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flamanville-3 2010-07-15.jpg|thumb| right|EDF has said its third-generation EPR [[Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant|Flamanville]] 3 project (seen here in 2010) will be delayed until 2019, due to "both structural and economic reasons," and the project's total cost has climbed to EUR 11 billion in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-edf-nuclear-flamanville-idUSBRE8B214620121203 EDF raises French EPR reactor cost to over $11 billion], ''Reuters'', Dec 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

Advanced new reactors under construction in Finland and France, which were meant to lead a [[nuclear renaissance]], have been delayed and are running over-budget.&lt;ref name="jk"/&gt; There has been a 15-year gap in building reactors, which has meant that there are difficulties in manufacturing the high quality parts required for a reactor. The new reactor also represents an advance over existing technologies, with better reliability and safety over [[Generation II reactor]]s. Finally, they are "first-of-a-kind" industrial plants, having then all the kinds of problems and delays that should be avoided in following projects.

The European nuclear industry is working to develop [[Generation IV]] nuclear reactors. [[Foratom]] is a Brussels-based trade organisation that bills itself as the "voice of the nuclear industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foratom.org/about-us.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003223116/http://www.foratom.org/about-us.html |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with companies and trade organisations like Foratom, [[General Electric]], [[Hitachi]], and [[Toshiba]] are all partners in the European Nuclear Industry. Other partners may include [[Tokyo Electric Power Company|TEPCO]] from Japan and [[Korea Electric Power Corporation|KEPCO]] from South Korea. The nuclear industry is regulated by governments and financing is often provided to private contractors who do the work.

Nuclear Safety is an ongoing discussion in the EU. The Western European Nuclear Regulators Association has members from 17 states or European countries. Nuclear safety faces many challenges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wenra.org/extra/pod/?id=14&amp;module_instance=1&amp;action=pod_show{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  WENR addresses these challenges and commits itself to objective reporting.  An example of a report is the publication, "Stress Test" specifications, Proposal by the WENRA Task Force, 21 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wenra.org/dynamaster/file_archive/110421/0ea2c97b35d658d73d1013f765e0c87d/StressTestsSpecifications2011-04-21.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future plans==
Currently, eight European countries are building new reactors, or seriously planning to build new ones:&lt;ref name="Nuclear Power in the World Today"&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/world-nuclear-power-reactors-and-uranium-requireme.aspx World Nuclear Power Reactors &amp; Uranium Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;

Power companies are building nuclear reactors in Finland and France and the French state continues to fund nuclear power, with a €1 billion added to help research for fourth-generation technology and nuclear safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France nuclear power funding gets 1bn euro boost|date=27 June 2011|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13924602|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries, among the ones owning nuclear power plants, have anyway expanded their nuclear power generation capacity by just upgrading existing reactors. Such upgrades granted from 10% to 29% more power per unit.&lt;ref name="Plans For New Reactors Worldwide"&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Current-and-Future-Generation/Plans-For-New-Reactors-Worldwide/ Plans For New Reactors Worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atom-Moratorium.svg|thumb| Eight German nuclear power reactors (Biblis A and B, Brunsbuettel, Isar 1, Kruemmel, Neckarwestheim 1, Philippsburg 1 and Unterweser) were permanently shutdown on 6 August 2011, following the Japanese [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/programmes/a2/ |title=Power Reactor Information System |author=IAEA |date=2011|work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As said, the 2011 Japanese [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] has led some European energy officials to re-think about nuclear power generation, above all in Germany and Switzerland. [[Switzerland]] has abandoned plans to replace its old nuclear reactors and will take the last one offline in 2034. [[Anti-nuclear movement in Germany|Anti-nuclear opposition]] intensified in Germany. In the following months [[Cabinet Merkel II|the government]] decided to shut down eight reactors immediately (6 August 2011) and to have the other nine off the grid by the end of 2022. [[Renewable energy in Germany]] is believed to be able to compensate for much of the loss. In September 2011 Siemens, which had been responsible for constructing all 17 of Germany's existing nuclear power plants, announced that it would exit the [[nuclear sector]] following the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent changes to German energy policy. Chief executive [[Peter Loescher]] has supported the German government's planned ''[[Energiewende]]'', its transition to renewable energy technologies, calling it a "project of the century" and saying Berlin's target of reaching 35% renewable energy sources by 2020 was feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14963575 | work=BBC News | title=Siemens to quit nuclear industry | date=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the phasing out of nuclear energy seems to be much more difficult and costly than expected. The transition is tending more towards polluting fossil fuel plants than clean renewable energies, sparking several critics. Actually, transition plans did not meet their short-term goals and will hardly meet their medium-term goals; fossil fuel prices and technology are still more efficient, cheaper and easier to implement than heavily state-subsidised solar and wind power generation.&lt;ref name="spiegel.de"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paristechreview.com"/&gt;

'''Rapid intensification''' is a [[meteorology|meteorological]] condition that occurs when a [[tropical cyclone]] intensifies dramatically in a short period of time. The United States [[National Hurricane Center]] defines rapid intensification as an increase in the [[maximum sustained winds]] of a tropical cyclone of at least {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h|round=5}} in a 24-hour period.&lt;ref name="NHC glossary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of NHC Terms|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|accessdate=April 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OVedwMm5?url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml|archivedate=April 1, 2014|deadurl=no|author=National Hurricane Center|date=March 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Necessary conditions==
===External===
In order for rapid intensification to occur, several conditions must be in place. [[Sea surface temperature|Water temperatures]] must be extremely warm (near or above 30&amp;nbsp;°C, 86&amp;nbsp;°F), and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not churn deeper cooler waters up to the surface. [[Wind shear]] must be low; when wind shear is high, the [[Convection#Atmospheric convection|convection]] and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/hurricane-patricia-factors-for-rapid-intensification-strongest-hurricane-on|title=Multiple Factors Allowed Hurricane Patricia to Rapidly Intensify|first=Linda|last=Lam|publisher=The Weather Channel|date=October 23, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Internal===
Usually, an [[anticyclone]] in the upper layers of the [[troposphere]] above the storm must be present as well—for extremely low surface pressures to develop, air must be rising very rapidly in the [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]] of the storm, and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently.&lt;ref name="Energetics"&gt;{{cite web | author=Diana Engle | title=Hurricane Structure and Energetics | publisher=Data Discovery Hurricane Science Center | accessdate=2008-10-26 | url=http://www.newmediastudio.org/DataDiscovery/Hurr_ED_Center/Hurr_Structure_Energetics/Hurr_Struct.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527094650/http://www.newmediastudio.org/DataDiscovery/Hurr_ED_Center/Hurr_Structure_Energetics/Hurr_Struct.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=September 2017}} [[Hot towers]] have been implicated in tropical cyclone rapid intensification, though they have diagnostically seen varied impacts across basins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhuge|first1=Xiao-Yong|last2=Ming|first2=Jie|last3=Wang|first3=Yuan|title=Reassessing the Use of Inner-Core Hot Towers to Predict Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification*|journal=Weather and Forecasting|date=October 2015|volume=30|issue=5|pages=1265–1279|doi=10.1175/WAF-D-15-0024.1|bibcode=2015WtFor..30.1265Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ratargul Swamp Forest, Sylhet..jpg|Ratargul Swamp Forest|thumb|right|300px]]
'''Ratargul Swamp Forest''' is a [[freshwater swamp forest]] located in Gowain River, Fatehpur Union, [[Gowainghat Upazila|Gowainghat]], [[Sylhet District|Sylhet]], Bangladesh. It is the only swamp forest located in Bangladesh and one of the few freshwater swamp forest in the world. The forest is naturally conserved under the Department of Forestry, Govt. of Bangladesh.

Its area is 3, 325.61 acre including 504 acre declared as the animal sanctuary in 2015. It is known as the Amazon of Bangla and Sundarbans of Sylhet. This only swamp forest in Bangladesh is located 26 km far from Sylhet.  The forest's name comes from the word, "Rata" or "Pati" tree, used by the locals of Sylhet.

The evergreen forest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-bangla.blogspot.in/2011/11/land-found-in-haors.html|title=The land found in the haors|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is situated by the river ''Goain'' and linked with the channel ''Chengir Khal''. Most of the trees growing here are the [[Millettia pinnata]] (করচ গাছ "Koroch tree''). The forest is submerged under 20–30 feet water in the rainy season. For the rest of the year, the water level is about 10 feet deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banglaview24.com/tourist-places/ratargul-swamp-forest.html|title=Ratargul Swamp forest  –  Bangladesh|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daily-sun.com/details_yes_13-05-2012_Ratargul_142_1_2_1_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wtd.unwto.org/en/photo-competitor/2012-08-31/ratargul-swamp-forest|title=Ratargul swamp forest – World Tourism Day|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:Ratargul Swamp Forrest Sylhet 2.jpg|thumb|297x297px|View of the swamp forest from the watch tower.]]
Ratargul is about 26 kilometres from [[Sylhet district|Sylhet]]. There is a 3,325 acres wetland in Sylhet range-2 under the forest department and in that wetland Ratargul swamp forest is about 504 acres.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.visitbangladesh.biz/2013/09/swamp-forest-ratargul-amazon-of.html Amazon of Bangladesh]&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Gowainghat Upazila|Gowainghat]].

Access date: 13 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==
Tropical air from the north-west of Sylhet causes heavy rainfall. According to Sylhet Weather Centre, average rainfall is 4162 millimetre per year. Highest rainfall occurs in July which is 1250 millimetre. On the other hand, December is the driest season with 74% [[relative density]] which jumps up to more than 90% in July–August. The forest is linked with [[Gowain river]] through a lake namely ''chengir khal''. In the rainy season, too much water from [[India]] enter into the lake through Gowain river and the forest become flooded. This situation prevails from May to early October and the temperature remains 32-degree Celsius which drops to 12-degree Celsius in January. In the rainy season, trees remain 10&amp;nbsp;ft (somewhere even 15–20&amp;nbsp;ft) under water but the forest become dry in winter season.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury2004"&gt;{{cite book| first=Junayed K. |last=Chowdhury |year=2004 |title=Biodiversity of Ratargul Swamp Forest, Sylhet |publisher=IUCN The World Conservation Union| oclc=255416492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hybridknowledge.info/2013/11/ratargul-swamp-forest.html Ratargul Swamp Forest climate]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant diversity ==

73 species of plants could be found in the forest till now. 80 percent of the forest area is covered with umbrella of the trees.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury2004" /&gt;

Two layer of plants can be seen in the swamp forest. The upper layer consists of trees and the lower one consists of intense [[Schumannianthus dichotomus]]. The canopy of the plants spreads up to 15 meters of height.

Though the forest is natural, the Forestry Department of Bangladesh has planted some watery plants like [[Calamus tenuis]], [[Burflower Tree]], [[Barringtonia acutangula]], [[Calamus tenuis]]. [[Banyan Tree]] is very common in the forest. Besides that, [[Barringtonia acutangula]], [[Milletia Pinnata]], [[Sacred Garlic Pear]] or [[Temple Plant]], [[Alstonia Scholaris]] can also be seen.

A '''ring current''' is an [[electric current]] carried by charged particles trapped in a planet's [[magnetosphere]]. It is caused by the longitudinal drift of energetic (10&amp;ndash;200 k[[electron volt|eV]]) particles.

==Earth's ring current==
[[File:Currents.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Schematic view of the different current systems which shape the Earth's [[magnetosphere]].]]
[[Earth]]'s ring current is responsible for shielding the lower latitudes of the Earth from magnetospheric electric fields.  It therefore has a large effect on the electrodynamics of [[geomagnetic storm]]s. The ring current system consists of a band, at a distance of 3 to 8 [[Earth radius|''R''&lt;sub&gt;E]]&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The ring current energy is mainly carried around by the ions, most of which are protons. However, one also sees alpha particles in the ring current, a type of ion that is plentiful in the solar wind. In addition, a certain percentage are O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen ions, similar to those in the ionosphere of Earth, though much more energetic. This mixture of ions suggests that ring current particles probably come from more than one source.

During a [[geomagnetic storm]], the number of particles in the ring current will increase. As a result, there is a decrease in the effects of [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic field]].

Rise Against Hunger, [http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/wake-county/article129005999.html formerly Stop Hunger Now], is an international hunger relief non-profit organization that coordinates the packaging and distribution of food and other life-changing aid to people in developing nations. Founded in 1998, Rise Against Hunger mobilizes more than 350,000 volunteers each year to package meals for people in need around the globe. Since 2005, Rise Against Hunger has  distributed more than 315,000,000 meals to recipients in 74 countries with a mission to end hunger in our lifetime.
==History==

Rise Against Hunger is an international hunger relief agency that seeks to end global hunger by engaging local volunteers. The organization was formed in 1998 by Ray Buchanan, a United Methodist Minister, and began its meal packaging program in 2005. The organizational mission is stated as "Rise Against Hunger is driven by the vision of a world without hunger. Its mission is to end hunger in our lifetime by providing food and life-changing aid to the world’s most vulnerable and creating a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources."

==Areas of Focus==
Rise Against Hunger aims to end hunger through four pathways: Nourishing Lives, Responding to Emergencies, Empowering Communities and Growing the Movement. From the implementation of sustainable development community projects to the meal packaging program that utilizes local volunteers, Rise Against Hunger strives to make a global impact on hunger by building resilience, self-sufficiency and empowerment among the world’s most vulnerable populations.   

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/nourishing-lives/ Nourishing Lives]===
Rise Against Hunger supports safety net programs that support nourishment and skills trainings that help the world’s most vulnerable navigate the difficult journey out of poverty. Rise Against Hunger partners with schools in order to promote and incentivize increased attendance. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger works to partner with skills trainings and clinics in order to support adults learning new trades and encourage healthy lifestyles. Rise Against Hunger works to nourish lives through a holistic approach in the development of the most vulnerable populations.

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/responding-to-crisis/ Responding to Emergencies]===
Rise Against Hunger responds to emergencies. In times of floods, droughts or political unrest, to name a few, Rise Against Hunger aims to provide the immediate critical need, food. Access to food, wages and market systems are often destroyed in times of emergency. Rise Against Hunger works with its in-country partner organizations in order to address the immediate needs in the wake of crisis. Each year Rise Against Hunger reserves 10% of its projected meals to respond to crisis situations. Official Rise Against Hunger responses include the 2016 [[Hurricane Matthew]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian conflict]], [[South Sudanese Civil War|South Sudanese conflict]] and [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/empowering-communities/ Empowering Communities]===
In order to create long-term solutions to hunger and poverty, Rise Against Hunger works to empower communities through agricultural and income-generating initiatives. Rise Against Hunger works to increase agriculture production and incomes through programs that promote improved agricultural methods, business skills and market access. Farmers, one of the most food insecure populations in the world, are given access to quality seeds and fertilizers to increase agricultural production and diversify their crops. Rise Against Hunger supports vocational training to help at-risk individuals increase their earning potentials and gain consistent access to food.

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/get-involved/ Growing the Movement]===
Part of Rise Against Hunger’s mission is to create a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources to end hunger. Rise Against Hunger works with volunteer groups from [http://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/local/hearing-the-call-ridgeview-baptist-fights-hunger/article_44250e2a-1cbd-11e7-b13c-db649d8b7886.html communities of faith], [http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Markets/Kraft-Heinz-expands-CSR-to-hunger-sustainability-environment corporations], [http://pilotonline.com/news/local/milestones-virginia-beach--year-old-organizes-fun-run-food/article_17c83b47-0fd8-5c61-b326-1d82310b7202.html schools] and [http://maynard.wickedlocal.com/news/20170320/local-rotary-clubs-pack-meals-for-rise-against-hunger civic clubs] to package meals while developing a greater awareness of hunger-related issues. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger engages its supporters to participate in advocacy activities to work toward changing laws, policies, systems and attitudes to end hunger by 2030.

==Meal packaging program==

The assembly process combines rice, soy, dehydrated vegetables and a micronutrient flavoring mix formulated by [http://www.heinz.com/sustainability/communities/heinz-micronutrient-campaign.aspx Kraft Heinz Company Foundation] that includes 23 essential vitamins and minerals. The cost of each meal varies between 29 and 34 cents. The food has a shelf-life of two years.
Rise Against Hunger provides over 70% of its meals to support transformational development programs such as school lunch programs, vocational training programs, early childhood development programs, orphanages, and medical clinics. Working with these programs helps enhance lives by giving beneficiaries the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty through education, skills development, and healthcare while also receiving much needed nutrition.

==Grant program==

Rise Against Hunger supports partner organizations in developing countries by providing direct financial assistance to support ongoing programs that provide food, medicines or other basic necessities to impoverished populations. This program enables Rise Against Hunger to respond to crises immediately by working with organizations already on the ground. It also supports local economies in developing areas and promotes self-reliance.

A '''rock veneer''' is a [[geomorphic]] formation in which rock fragments ([[clasts]]) of gravel or cobble size form a thin cover over a surface or hillslope. Rock veneers are typically one or two clasts thick and may partially or fully cover the ground surface.&lt;ref&gt;Osterkamp, W.R., 2008, [http://fisp.wes.army.mil/OFR20081217.pdf ''Annotated Definitions of Selected Geomorphic Terms and Related Terms of Hydrology, Sedimentology, Soil Science and Ecology'']. U.S Department of the Interior U.S Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia, Open File Report 2008-1217, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
Veneers typically form in semiarid and arid regions where chemical weathering rates and the potential for [[mass wasting]] are low. Other names for a rock veneer are rock-fragment cover (RFC), stone pavement, desert pavement, stony mantle, [[wikt:hammada|hammada]] and [[wikt:reg|reg]].

==Formation==
Rock veneers commonly arise from the weathering of resistant rocks of [[quartzite]], felsic [[granites]], coarse granites, and dense [[basalts]]. As these larger rocks are deposited on a surface, smaller sands either are removed by wind or water erosion, or settle and form a fine-grained layer beneath the larger veneer rocks. The larger clasts then rearrange and settle to form the rock veneer.&lt;ref&gt;Lenart, M.T., Osterkamp, W.R., and Toy, T.J., "Development of partial rock veneers by root throw in a subalpine setting". Wiley InterScience, Sept 27, 2005. {{doi|10.1002/esp.1222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock veneers form a variety of ways, with two major types; ''in situ'' veneers form in place by means of [[weathering]], [[fluvial erosion]], [[Aeolian processes|deflation]] (the removal of loose, fine-grained particles) or [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]]; other veneers are transported via [[soil creep]], [[sheet flooding]] or gully gravure (described below).&lt;ref&gt;Toy, Terrence, and Osterkamp, W.R., "The Stability of Rock-Veneered Hillslopes." International Journal of Sediment Research, Vol 14, No 3, 1999, pp. 63-73. {{doi|10.1002/esp.1222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock veneers are typically distinguished through six variables: particle size, particle density, stability characteristics, potential for storing mobile sediments, degree of abrasion, and varnishing.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D.K.C., Cooke, R.U., and Warren, A., 1986. [http://qjegh.lyellcollection.org/content/19/3/251.abstract "Geomorphological investigation, for engineering purposes of blowing sand and dust hazard"]. Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology, Vol 19, pp. 251-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gully Gravure===
Gully gravure is a transportation process by which rock veneers can be formed. Valleys formed of [[gullies]] and [[rill]]s are made and coarse rock fragments are deposited in side channels. As the side channels fill in, water forms new, less resistant channels down the borders of the coarse channels and finer gullies and rills. These channels build up, and the process happens again, resulting in a reversal of rills and gullies, with coarser clasts on the surface.

===Root Throw===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}

Root throw is the process that occurs when a tree topples, raising its rootwad and the rock fragments in it. Fine sediment falls back into the rootwad pit or travels downstream, but coarse sediments form a local rock veneer around the rootwad. This local rock veneer is larger than the pit of the rootwad, as falling clasts extend the area of veneer. In a study{{which|date=May 2011}} of rootwads in Westcliffe, Colorado, it was estimated that root throw could have created a rock veneer over 90% of the surface during the [[Holocene]].

Root throw produces a rock veneer when there are a large number of clasts near the surface, where there are: a slow rate of chemical weathering, insufficient precipitation to move the large clasts, high velocity winds, conditions favorable to shallow-rooted trees, and trees large enough to embed coarse rock in their roots.

==Effects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}

Hillslopes with a rock veneer are more stable than those without and have lower erosion rates. Rock veneers form a rocky armor on the hillslope which prevents the erosion of smaller sediments and stabilizes the slope. Rock veneers, forming when influx and outflux sediment rates are equal, indicate a hillslope in equilibrium, partly due to their protective cover on the slope. Erosion rates on veneered hillslopes are low to moderate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3659">{{about|the rotation of an object around a single axis (a one-dimensional rotation)|the kinetic energy of an object that rotates in three dimensions|rigid rotor}}'''Rotational energy''' or '''angular kinetic energy''' is [[kinetic energy]] due to the [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotation]] of an object and is part of its [[Kinetic energy#Rotation in systems|total kinetic energy]]. Looking at rotational energy separately around an object's [[axis of rotation]], the following dependence on the object's [[moment of inertia]] is observed:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{rotational} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt; \omega \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]]
: &lt;math&gt; I \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] around the axis of rotation
: &lt;math&gt; E \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[kinetic energy]]
The [[mechanical work]] required for / applied during rotation is the [[torque]] times the rotation angle. The instantaneous [[power (physics)|power]] of an angularly accelerating body is the [[torque]] times the angular velocity. For free-floating (unattached) objects, the axis of rotation is commonly around its [[center of mass]].

Note the close relationship between the result for rotational energy and the energy held by linear (or translational) motion:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{translational} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 &lt;/math&gt;

In the rotating system, the [[moment of inertia]], ''I'', takes the role of the mass, ''m'', and the [[angular velocity]], &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;, takes the role of the linear velocity, ''v''. The rotational energy of a [[wheel|rolling]] [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] varies from one half of the translational energy (if it is massive) to the same as the translational energy (if it is hollow).

An example is the calculation of the rotational kinetic energy of the Earth. As the Earth has a period of about 23.93 hours, it has an angular velocity of 7.29×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; rad/s. The Earth has a moment of inertia, I = 8.04×10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/MomentofInertiaEarth.html Moment of inertia--Earth], Wolfram&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it has a rotational kinetic energy of 2.138×10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; J.

Another example of actually using earth's rotational energy is the locating of opportune spaceports. The European spaceport in French Guiana ([[Guiana Space Centre]]) is within about 5 degrees of the equator, so space rocket launches (for primarily geo-stationary satellites) from here to the east obtain nearly all of the full rotational speed of the earth at the equator (about 1,000 mph, sort of a "sling-shot benefit). Rocket launches easterly from Kennedy (USA) on the other hand obtain only about 400 mph added benefit, due to the lower relative rotational speed of the earth at that northerly latitude. This saves significant rocket fuel per launch, so this tends to be a relatively more economic spaceport.

Part of the earth's rotational energy can also be tapped using [[tidal power]]. Additional friction of the two global tidal waves creates energy in a physical manner, infinitesimally slowing down Earth's angular velocity ''ω''. Due to the [[Angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conservation of angular momentum]], this process transfers angular momentum to the Moon's [[orbit]]al motion, increasing its distance from Earth and its orbital period (see [[tidal locking]] for a more detailed explanation of this process).

Riyadh declared that it was following a nuclear power program without co-operation of other countries, and according to a royal command in April 2010: "The development of atomic energy is essential to meet the Kingdom's growing requirements for energy to generate electricity, produce desalinated water and reduce reliance on depleting hydrocarbon resources." [[King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy|KA-CARE]] has been set up in the capital of Saudi Arabia in order to progress this agenda which is considered as an alternative to oil, and also to be the proper agency for the purpose of treaties on nuclear energy signed by Saudi kingdom.

"The Saudi government's use of weapons which contain toxic and pathogenic gases in air and missile strikes against residential areas is aimed at genocide and breaking the legitimate resistance of the brave Yemeni people,"  [[Ali Shamkhani|Shamkhani]] as the Secretary of [[Iran]]'s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) did remark in a meeting which was held with an agent of Yemen's high council of revolution in Iran. Meanwhile, according to a report by the human rights watch, Saudi Arabia has used a kind of poisonous gas in four airstrikes on diverse parts of the province of Sa'ada in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.alalam.ir/news/1746125/shamkhani--saudi-arabia-uses-biological-weapons-against-yemeni-people Shamkhani: Saudi Arabia Uses Biological Weapons against Yemeni People] en.alalam.ir Retrieved 22 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7351">The '''South Western Ghats montane rain forests''' are an [[ecoregion]] of [[South India|southern India]], covering the southern portion of the [[Western Ghats]] range in [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], at elevations over 1000 meters. They are cooler and wetter than the lower-elevation [[South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests]], which surround the montane rain forests.

==Setting==
The ecoregion is the most species rich in peninsular [[India]], and is home to numerous [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species. It covers an area of {{convert|22,600|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. It is estimated that two-thirds of the original forests have been cleared, and only 3,200 square kilometers, or 15% of the intact area, is protected.

The southern portion of the Western Ghats contains the highest peaks in the range, notably [[Anai Mudi]] in Kerala, at 2695 meters elevation. The Ghats intercept the moisture-laden [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], and the average annual precipitation exceeds 2,800&amp;nbsp;mm. The northeast monsoon from October to November supplements the June to September southwest monsoon. The South Western Ghats are the wettest portion of peninsular India, and are surrounded by drier ecoregions to the east and north.

==Flora==
[[File:Satyrium nepalense-Silent Valley-2016-08-13-001.jpg|thumb|''[[Satyrium nepalense]]'' in [[Silent Valley National Park]]]]
The cool and moist climate, high rainfall, and variety of microclimates brought about by differences in elevation and exposure supports lush and diverse forests; 35% of the plant species are endemic to the ecoregion. Moist evergreen [[montane forest]]s are the predominant [[habitat]] type. The montane evergreen forests support a great diversity of species. The trees generally form a canopy at 15 to 20 m, and the forests are multistoried and rich in [[epiphytes]], especially [[orchid]]s. Characteristic canopy trees are ''[[Cullenia]] exarillata'', ''[[Mesua ferrea]]'', ''[[Palaquium]] ellipticum'', ''[[Gluta]] travancorica'', and ''[[Nageia]] wallichiana''. ''Nageia'' is a [[podocarp]] [[conifer]] with origins in the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], of which India was formerly part, and a number of other plants in the ecoregion have Gondwana origins. Other evergreen tree species of the montane forest include ''[[Calophyllum]] austroindicum'', ''[[Garcinia]] rubro-echinata'', ''Garcinia travancorica'', ''[[Diospyros]] barberi'', ''[[Memecylon]] subramanii'', ''Memecylon gracile'', ''[[Goniothalamus]] rhyncantherus'', and ''[[Vernonia]] travancorica''.

The other major habitat type in the ecoregion is the ''[[shola]]''-grassland complex, found at elevations of 1,900 to 2,220 m. ''Shola'' is a stunted forest, with an upper story of small trees, generally ''Pygeum gardneri'', ''[[Schefflera]] racemosa'', ''[[Linociera]] ramiflora'', ''[[Syzygium]]'' spp., ''[[Rhododendron]] nilgiricum'', ''[[Mahonia]] nepalensis'', ''[[Elaeocarpus]] recurvatus'', ''[[Ilex]] denticulata'', ''[[Michelia]] nilagirica'', ''[[Actinodaphne]] bourdellonii'', and ''[[Litsea]] wightiana''. Below the upper story is a low understory and a dense shrub layer. These ''shola'' forests are interspersed with [[montane grassland]]s, characterized by frost- and fire-resistant [[grass]] species like ''Chrysopogon zeylanicus'', ''Cymbopogon flexuosus'', ''Arundinella ciliata'', ''Arundinella mesophylla'', ''Arundinella tuberculata'', ''Themeda tremula'', and ''Sehima nervosum''.

==Fauna==
The ecoregion also supports a rich fauna, which is also high in endemism: of 78 [[mammal]] species, 10 are endemic, along with 42% of the [[fish]]es, 48% of the [[reptile]]s, and 75% of the [[amphibia]]ns. Of 309 [[bird]] species, 13 are endemic.

The ecoregion supports India's largest [[elephant]] population, along with populations of threatened [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris''), [[leopard]] (''Panthera pardus''), [[sloth bear]] (''Melursus ursinus''), [[gaur]] (''Bos gaurus''), and [[dhole|dhole or Indian wild dog]] (''Cuon alpinus''). The rare and endemic [[Nilgiri tahr]] (''Nilgiritragus hylocrius'') is limited to a 400&amp;nbsp;km band of ''[[shola]]''-grassland mosaic, from the [[Nilgiri Hills]] in the north to the [[Agasthyamalai Hills|Agasthyamalai (Ashambu) Hills]] in the south. The [[lion-tailed macaque]] (''Macaca silenus'') and [[Nilgiri langur]] (''Semnopithecus johnii'') are endangered endemic [[primate]] species.

90 of India's 484 reptile species are endemic to the ecoregion, with eight endemic genera (''Brachyophidium, Dravidogecko, Melanophidium, Plectrurus, Ristella, Salea, Teretrurus'', and ''Xylophis''). Almost 50% of India's 206 amphibian species are endemic to the ecoregion, with six endemic genera (''Indotyphlus, Melanobatrachus, Nannobatrachus, Nyctibatrachus, Ranixalus'', and ''Uraeotyphlus'').

==Protected areas==
As of 1997, 13 protected areas were designated, covering an area of over 3,200 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wikramanayake|first1=Eric|last2=Dinerstein|first2=Eric|last3=Loucks|first3=Colby J.|year=2002|title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment|publisher=Island Press|location=[[Washington, DC]]|page=326–328|isbn=978-1559-639-23-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the protected areas in the northern portion of the ecoregion are included within the [[Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve]], and the [[Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve]] covers the southern portion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4285">'''Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic''' is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of eastern Africa. It is a southern variation of [[Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic]].

==Setting==
The [[ecoregion]] extends along the coast of [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]], from Tanzania's [[Lukuledi River]] south almost the whole way to the mouth of the [[Limpopo River]]. The ecoregion supports habitats of [[forest]], [[savanna]] and [[swamp]]s.

The ecoregion is bounded on the east by the [[Indian Ocean]]. To the north, it abuts the [[Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic]]. It transitions to drier open woodlands to the west – the [[Eastern Miombo woodlands]] at the northern end, the [[Zambezian and Mopane woodlands]] in the central portion, and the [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] at the southern end. To the south, it borders the [[Maputaland coastal forest mosaic]]. It also includes some small offshore islands in Mozambique, including the [[Quirimbas Islands]] and [[Bazarruto Archipelago]].

The ecoregion is mostly coastal, generally within 50 km of the Indian Ocean. It encompasses coastal lowlands, rolling hills, and isolated plateaus and inselbergs, including the [[Rondo Plateau|Rondo]] and [[Makonde Plateau|Makonde]] plateaus in southern Tanzania and the [[Mueda Plateau]] in northern Mozambique. It includes some isolated mountainous enclaves further inland, including [[Mount Chiperone]], [[Mount Mabu]], [[Mount Morrumbala]], [[Mount Namuli]], and [[Mount Tumbine]] in Mozambique. The mountains intercept humid southwesterly winds from the Indian Ocean, which form clouds and rain and create a cooler, wetter climate than the surrounding lowlands. These mountains are home to lowland evergreen forests with a similar flora to the coastal lowland forests, and higher-elevation montane forests, woodlands, grasslands, and heathlands which are home to many [[Afromontane]] species.&lt;ref&gt;"Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane Coastal Forest Mosaic". Worldwide Fund for Nature. Accessed 24 June 2018. [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0128]&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern portion of the ecoregion is not very well known due to the prolonged civil war in [[Mozambique]].

==Climate==
The climate is tropical in the northern portion, becoming sub-tropical at the southern end. In the area around Lindi in Tanzania there is one long dry season and one wet season. Rainfall is 800–1000 mm per year, and is higher on some of the plateaus and mountains. The climate is similar in the Mozambican portion, although rainfall is lower (800 mm) in northern Mozambique, which is in the [[rain shadow]] of [[Madagascar]]. Mean maximum temperatures are 30-27° C in the north and 24° C in the south, and mean minimum temperature is 18-15° C throughout the ecoregion.&lt;ref&gt;"Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane Coastal Forest Mosaic". Worldwide Fund for Nature. Accessed 24 June 2018. [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0128]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protected areas==
Protected areas within the ecoregion include:
* [[Rondo Forest Reserve]], Tanzania
* [[Bazaruto National Park]], Mozambique
* Caça do Gilé wildlife reserve (part), Mozambique
* [[Gorongosa National Park]] (part), Mozambique
* [[Pomene National Reserve]], Mozambique
* [[Quirimbas National Park]], Mozambique

==History of synthetic rubber==
The expanded use of bicycles, and particularly their pneumatic [[tire]]s, starting in the 1890s, created increased demand for rubber. In 1909, a team headed by [[Fritz Hofmann (chemist)|Fritz Hofmann]], working at the [[Bayer]] laboratory in [[Elberfeld]], Germany, succeeded in polymerizing [[isoprene]], the first synthetic rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=The Moving Powers of Rubber |location=Leverkusen, Germany |publisher=[[Lanxess AG|LANXESS AG]]: 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pslc.ws/macrog/exp/rubber/synth/methyl.htm |series=The Story of Rubber |title=Destination Germany: A Poor Substitute|date=2000|first1=Mark |last1=Michalovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rubber polymer synthesized from [[butadiene]] was created in 1910 by the Russian scientist [[Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev]]. This form of synthetic rubber provided the basis for the first large-scale commercial production by the tsarist empire, which occurred during World War I as a result of shortages of natural rubber. This early form of synthetic rubber was again replaced with natural rubber after the war ended, but investigations of synthetic rubber continued. Russian American [[Ivan Ostromislensky]] who moved to New York in 1922 did significant early research on synthetic rubber and a couple of monomers in the early 20th century. Political problems that resulted from great fluctuations in the cost of natural rubber led to the enactment of the [[Stevenson Act]] in 1921. This act essentially created a [[cartel]] which supported rubber prices by regulating production, but insufficient supply, especially due to wartime shortages, also led to a search for alternative forms of synthetic rubber.

By 1925 the price of natural rubber had increased to the point that many companies were exploring methods of producing synthetic rubber to compete with natural rubber. In the United States, the investigation focused on different materials than in Europe, building on the early laboratory work of Fr [[Julius Nieuwland]], a professor of chemistry at the [[University of Notre Dame]], who developed the synthesis of [[neoprene]].

Studies published in 1930 written independently by Lebedev, the American [[Wallace Carothers]] and the German scientist [[Hermann Staudinger]] led in 1931 to one of the first successful synthetic rubbers, known as [[neoprene]], which was developed at [[DuPont]] under the direction of [[Elmer Keiser Bolton|E. K. Bolton]]. Neoprene is highly resistant to heat and chemicals such as [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gasoline]], and is used in fuel hoses and as an insulating material in machinery. The company [[Thiokol]] applied their name to a competing type of rubber based on [[1,2-Dichloroethane|ethylene dichloride]],&lt;ref name=hb-elast-p135&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=Douglas C. |editor1-last=Bhowmick |editor1-first=Anil K. |editor2-last=Stephens|editor2-first=Howard |title=Handbook of Elastomers, Second Edition |date=2001 |publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc. |isbn=0-8247-0383-9 |page=135 |chapter=Chap. 5 – Liquid Rubber |edition=First |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ZFwp_jBu0QsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Handbook+of+Elastomers,+Second+Edition+%2B+liquid+elastomers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1BrXVK2ADOTtmQWchoLIAw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Handbook%20of%20Elastomers%2C%20Second%20Edition%20%2B%20liquid%20elastomers&amp;f=false |accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was commercially available in 1930.

The first rubber plant in Europe [[:ru:СК-1 (завод)|SK-1]] (from Russian "Synthetic Kauchuk", {{lang-ru|СК-1}}) was established (Russia) by [[Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev|Sergei Lebedev]] in [[Yaroslavl]] under [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[first five-year plan]] on July 7, 1932.

In 1935, [[Germans|German]] chemists synthesized the first of a series of synthetic rubbers known as [[Reppe chemistry#Reppe chemistry|Buna rubbers]]. These were [[copolymers]], meaning the [[polymers]] were made up from two [[monomers]] in alternating sequence. Other brands included ''Koroseal'', which [[Waldo Semon]] developed in 1935, and ''Sovprene'', which Russian researchers created in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography'' 1940, "SEMON, WALDO LONSBURY" pp. 723–724&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Sheet of synthetic rubber coming off the rolling mill at the plant of Goodrich.jpg|thumb|Sheet of synthetic rubber coming off the rolling mill at the plant of [[BFGoodrich|Goodrich]] (1941)]]
[[File:"WATCH FOR THESE MARKS" - NARA - 516054.jpg|thumb|World War II poster about synthetic rubber tires]]
[[Goodrich Corporation|B. F. Goodrich Company]] scientist [[Waldo Semon]] developed a new and cheaper version of synthetic rubber known as Ameripol in 1940. Ameripol made synthetic rubber production much more cost effective, helping to meet the United States' needs during World War II.

The production of synthetic rubber in the United States expanded greatly during World War II, since the [[Axis powers]] controlled nearly all the world's limited supplies of natural rubber by mid-1942. Military trucks needed rubber for [[tire]]s, and rubber was used in almost every other war machine. The U.S. government launched a major (and largely secret) effort to improve synthetic rubber production. A large team of chemists from many institutions were involved, including [[Calvin Souther Fuller]] of [[Bell Labs]]. The rubber designated [[Styrene-butadiene|GRS]] (Government Rubber Styrene), a copolymer of butadiene and [[styrene]], was the basis for U.S. synthetic rubber production during World War II. By 1944, a total of 50 factories were manufacturing it, pouring out a volume of the material twice that of the world's natural rubber production before the beginning of the war. It still represents about half of total world production.

===Post-war===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
[[Solid-fuel rocket]]s during World War II used [[nitrocellulose]] for propellants, but it was impractical and dangerous to make such rockets very large. During the war, [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) researchers came up with a new solid fuel based on [[asphalt]] mixed with an [[oxidizing agent|oxidizer]] (such as [[Potassium perchlorate|potassium]] or [[ammonium perchlorate]]), and [[aluminium]] powder. This new solid fuel burned more slowly and evenly than nitrocellulose, and was much less dangerous to store and use, but it tended to slowly flow out of the rocket in storage and the rockets using it had to be stockpiled nose down.

After the war, Caltech researchers began to investigate the use of synthetic rubbers to replace asphalt in their solid fuel rocket motors. By the mid-1950s, large missiles were being built using solid fuels based on synthetic rubber, mixed with ammonium perchlorate and high proportions of aluminium powder. Such solid fuels could be cast into large, uniform blocks that had no cracks or other defects that would cause non-uniform burning. Ultimately, all large solid-fuel military rockets and missiles would use synthetic-rubber-based solid fuels, and they would also play a significant part in the civilian space effort.

Additional refinements to the process of creating synthetic rubber continued after the war. The chemical synthesis of [[isoprene]] accelerated the reduced need for natural rubber, and the peacetime quantity of synthetic rubber exceeded the production of natural rubber by the early 1960s.

Synthetic rubber is used a great deal in printing on textiles, in which case it is called '''rubber paste'''. In most cases titanium dioxide is used with copolymerization and volatile matter in producing such synthetic rubber for textile use. Moreover, this kind of preparation can be considered to be the pigment preparation based on titanium dioxide.

By the 1960s, most [[chewing gum]] companies had switched from using [[chicle]] to [[butadiene]]-based synthetic rubber which was cheaper to manufacture.

==Natural vs. synthetic rubber==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
[[File:RubberSyn&amp;Natural.png|thumb|440px|Chemical structure of cis-polyisoprene, the main constituent of natural rubber.  Synthetic cis-polyisoprene and natural cis-polyisoprene are derived from different precursors by different chemical pathways.]]
Natural rubber, coming from [[latex]] of ''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]'', is mainly poly-''cis''-[[isoprene]] containing traces of impurities like protein, dirt etc. Although it exhibits many excellent properties in terms of mechanical performance, natural rubber is often inferior to certain synthetic rubbers, especially with respect to its thermal stability and its compatibility with petroleum products.

Synthetic rubber, like other [[polymer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, is made from various petroleum-based [[monomer]]s.  The most prevalent synthetic rubbers are [[styrene-butadiene rubber]]s (SBR) derived from the [[copolymer]]ization of [[styrene]] and [[1,3-Butadiene|1,3-butadiene]]. Other synthetic rubbers are prepared from [[isoprene]] (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), [[chloroprene]] (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene), and [[isobutylene]] (methylpropene) with a small percentage of isoprene for [[cross-link]]ing. These and other monomers can be mixed in various proportions to be [[copolymer]]ized to produce products with a range of physical, mechanical, and chemical properties. The monomers can be produced pure, and the addition of impurities or additives can be controlled by design to give optimal properties. Polymerization of pure monomers can be better controlled to give a desired proportion of [[Cis-trans isomerism|''cis'' and ''trans'']] [[Covalent bond|double bonds]].

'''''The Selfish Gene''''' is a 1976 book on [[evolution]] by [[Richard Dawkins]], in which the author builds upon the principal theory of [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]'s ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966). Dawkins uses the term "selfish gene" as a way of expressing the [[gene-centered view of evolution|gene-centred view of evolution]] as opposed to the views focused on the organism and the [[Group selection|group]], popularising ideas developed during the 1960s by [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others. From the gene-centred view, it follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other.

A lineage is expected to evolve to maximise its [[inclusive fitness]]—the number of copies of its genes passed on globally (rather than by a particular individual). As a result, populations will tend towards an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. The book also coins the term ''[[meme]]'' for a unit of human [[cultural evolution]] analogous to the gene, suggesting that such "selfish" replication may also model human culture, in a different sense. [[Memetics]] has become the subject of many studies since the publication of the book.  In raising awareness of Hamilton's ideas, as well as making its own valuable contributions to the field, the book has also stimulated research on [[human inclusive fitness]].&lt;ref name="SBNK"&gt;{{cite book |author=Holland, Maximilian |year=2012 |title=[[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship|''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches'']] |publisher=Createspace Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the foreword to the book's 30th-anniversary edition, Dawkins said he "can readily see that [the book's title] might give an inadequate impression of its contents" and in retrospect thinks he should have taken [[Tom Maschler]]'s advice and called the book ''The Immortal Gene''.&lt;ref name="timesexcerpt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article738678.ece |title=It's all in the genes |last=Dawkins |first=Richard| date=12 March 2006 |publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] |accessdate=6 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615135027/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article738678.ece | archivedate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, ''The Selfish Gene'' was listed as the most influential science book of all time in a poll to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the [[Royal Society]] science book prize.

==Background==
Dawkins builds upon [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]'s book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966), which argued that [[altruism]] is not based upon [[group selection|group benefit]] ''per se'',&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; but is a result of [[natural selection|selection]] that occurs "at the level of the gene mediated by the [[phenotype]]"&lt;ref name=Williams2/&gt; and any selection at the group level occurred only under rare circumstances.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt; This approach was developed further during the 1960s by [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others who opposed [[group selection]] and selection aimed directly at benefit to the individual organism:&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the principle of '[[survival of the fittest]]' the ultimate criterion which determines whether [a gene] ''G'' will spread is not whether the behavior is to the benefit of the behaver, but whether it is to the benefit of the gene ''G'' ...With altruism this will happen only if the affected individual is a relative of the altruist, therefore having an increased chance of carrying the gene.
:— W. D. Hamilton, ''The Evolution of Altruistic Behavior'', pp. 354–355&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An extended discussion of Dawkins' views and his book ''The Selfish Gene'' is provided by Wilkins and Hull.&lt;ref name=Hull/&gt;

===Contents===

Dawkins begins by discussing the [[altruism]] that people display, indicating that he will argue it is explained by gene selfishness, and attacking [[group selection]] as an explanation. He considers the [[origin of life]] with the arrival of molecules able to replicate themselves. From there, he looks at [[DNA]]'s role in [[evolution]], and its organisation into [[chromosome]]s and [[gene]]s, which in his view behave selfishly. He describes [[organism]]s as [[teleology in biology|apparently purposive]] but fundamentally simple survival machines, which use [[negative feedback]] to [[homeostasis|achieve control]]. This extends, he argues, to the [[brain]]'s ability to simulate the world with subjective [[consciousness]], and [[signalling theory|signalling between species]]. He then introduces the idea of the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]], and uses it to explain why [[game theory|alternative competitive strategies]] like bullying and retaliating exist. This allows him to consider what selfishness in a gene might actually mean, describing [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s argument for [[kin selection]], that genes for [[ethology|behaviour]] that improves the survival chances of close relatives can spread in a population, because those relatives carry the same genes. 

Dawkins examines childbearing and raising children as evolutionary strategies. He attacks the idea of group selection for the good of the species as proposed by [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards]], arguing instead that each parent necessarily behaves selfishly. A question is whether parents should invest in their offspring equally or should favour some of them, and explains that what is best for the survival of the parents' genes is not always best for individual children. Similarly, Dawkins argues, there are conflicts of interest between males and females, but he notes that [[R. A. Fisher]] showed that the optimal sex ratio is 50:50. He explains that this is true even in an extreme case like the harem-keeping [[elephant seal]], where 4% of the males get 88% of copulations. In that case, the strategy of having a female offspring is safe, as she'll have a pup, but the strategy of having a male can bring a large return (dozens of pups), even though many males live out their lives as bachelors. [[Amotz Zahavi]]'s theory of [[honest signalling]] explains [[stotting]] as a selfish act, he argues, improving the springbok's chances of escaping from a predator by indicating how difficult the chase would be. 

Dawkins discusses why many species live in groups, achieving mutual benefits through mechanisms such as Hamilton's [[selfish herd]] model: each individual behaves selfishly but the result is herd behaviour. Altruism too can evolve, as in the [[social insects]] such as ants and bees, where [[worker bee|workers]] give up the right to reproduce in favour of a sister, the queen; in their case, the unusual ([[haplodiploid]]) system of [[sex determination system|sex determination]] may have helped to bring this about, as females in a nest are exceptionally closely related.

The final chapter of the first edition introduced the idea of the [[meme]], a [[Cultural learning|culturally-transmitted]] entity such as a hummable tune, by analogy to genetic transmission. Dawkins describes God as an old idea which probably arose many times, and which has sufficient psychological appeal to survive effectively in the meme pool. The second edition (1989) added two more chapters.

===Themes===
===="Selfish" genes====
In describing genes as being "selfish", Dawkins states unequivocally that he does not intend to imply that they are driven by any motives or [[Volition (psychology)|will]], but merely that their effects can be metaphorically and pedagogically described ''as if'' they were. His contention is that the genes that are passed on are the ones whose [[evolution]]ary consequences serve their own implicit interest (to continue the [[anthropomorphism]]) in being replicated, not necessarily those of the organism. In later work, Dawkins brings evolutionary "selfishness" down to creation of a widely proliferated [[The Extended Phenotype|''extended phenotype'']].&lt;ref name=ExPh/&gt;

For some, the metaphor of "selfishness" is entirely clear, while to others it is confusing, misleading, or simply silly to ascribe mental attributes to something that is mindless. For example, [[Andrew Brown (Guardian journalist)|Andrew Brown]] has written:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Brown |date=22 December 1998 |url=http://webpages.charter.net/sn9/science/dawkins2.html |title=The Science of Selfishness (book review of ''Unweaving the Rainbow'') |publisher=Salon Media Group |work=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:""Selfish", when applied to genes, doesn't mean "selfish" at all. It means, instead, an extremely important quality for which there is no good word in the English language: "the quality of being copied by a Darwinian selection process." This is a complicated mouthful. There ought to be a better, shorter word—but "selfish" isn't it."

[[Donald Symons]] also finds it inappropriate to use anthropomorphism in conveying scientific meaning in general, and particularly for the present instance. He writes in ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' (1979):&lt;ref name=Symons&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Donald Symons |last=Symons |first=Donald |chapter=The semantics of ultimate causation |title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality |page=42 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0195029079 |edition=Paperback |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lkISQRDurU0C&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In summary, the rhetoric of ''The Selfish Gene'' exactly reverses the real situation: through [the use of] metaphor genes are endowed with properties only sentient beings can possess, such as selfishness, while sentient beings are stripped of these properties and called machines...The anthropomorphism of genes...obscures the deepest mystery in the life sciences: the origin and nature of mind."

===="Replicators"====
Dawkins proposes the idea of the "replicator":&lt;ref name=DawkinsRep&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |author=Dawkins, Richard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OirfBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT231 |publisher=Best Books |year=1976}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:"It is finally time to return to the problem with which we started, to the tension between individual organism and gene as rival candidates for the central role in natural selection...One way of sorting this whole matter out is to use the terms ‘replicator’ and ‘vehicle’. The fundamental units of natural selection, the basic things that survive or fail to survive, that form lineages of identical copies with occasional random mutations, are called replicators. DNA molecules are replicators. They generally, for reasons that we shall come to, gang together into large communal survival machines or 'vehicles'."
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA253 p. 253] (Anniversary Edition)

The original replicator (Dawkins' ''&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;eplicator'') was the initial [[molecule]] which first managed to reproduce itself and thus gained an advantage over other molecules within the [[Abiogenesis#"Primordial soup theory|primordial soup]].&lt;ref name=Replicator&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |page=15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA15 |quote=At some point a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by accident. We will call it the ''Replicator''. It may not necessarily have been the biggest or the most complex molecule around, but it had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself |author=Dawkins, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; As replicating molecules became more complex, Dawkins postulates, the replicators became the genes within organisms, with each organism's body serving the purpose of a 'survival machine' for its genes.

Dawkins writes that gene combinations which help an organism to survive and reproduce tend to also improve the gene's own chances of being replicated, and, as a result, "successful" genes frequently provide a benefit to the organism. An example of this might be a gene that protects the organism against a disease. This helps the gene spread, and also helps the organism.

====Genes vs organisms====
There are other times when the implicit interests of the vehicle and replicator are in conflict, such as the genes behind certain male spiders' instinctive mating behaviour, which increase the organism's [[inclusive fitness]] by allowing it to reproduce, but shorten its life by exposing it to the risk of [[Spider cannibalism|being eaten by the cannibalistic female]]. Another example is the existence of [[Intragenomic conflict|segregation distorter]] genes that are detrimental to their host, but nonetheless propagate themselves at its expense.&lt;ref name=DawkinsUR/&gt; Likewise, the persistence of [[Noncoding DNA#Junk DNA|junk DNA]] that [Dawkins believed at that time] provides no benefit to its host can be explained on the basis that it is not subject to selection. These unselected for but transmitted DNA variations connect the individual genetically to its parents, but confer no survival benefit.&lt;ref name=DawkinsUR2/&gt;

These examples might suggest that there is a power struggle between genes and their interactor. In fact, the claim is that there isn't much of a struggle because the genes usually win without a fight. However, the claim is made that if the organism becomes intelligent enough to understand its own interests, as distinct from those of its genes, there can be true conflict.

An example of such a conflict might be a person using birth control to prevent fertilisation, thereby inhibiting the replication of his or her genes. But this action might not be a conflict of the 'self-interest' of the organism with his or her genes, since a person using birth control might also be enhancing the survival chances of their genes by limiting family size to conform with available resources, thus avoiding extinction as predicted under the [[Malthusian]] model of population growth.

====Altruism====
Dawkins says that his "purpose" in writing ''The Selfish Gene'' is "to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism." He does this by supporting the claim that "gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour. However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of [[altruism]] at the level of individual animals." Gene selection provides one explanation for [[kin selection]] and [[eusociality]], where organisms act altruistically, against their individual interests (in the sense of health, safety or personal reproduction), namely the argument that by helping related organisms reproduce, a gene succeeds in "helping" copies of themselves (or sequences with the same [[phenotype|phenotypic effect]]) in other bodies to replicate. The claim is made that these "selfish" actions of genes lead to unselfish actions by organisms. A requirement upon this claim, supported by Dawkins in Chapter 10: "You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours" by examples from nature, is the need to explain how genes achieve [[kin recognition]], or manage to orchestrate [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] and [[coevolution]]. Although Dawkins (and biologists in general) recognize these phenomena result in more copies of a gene, evidence is inconclusive whether this success is selected for at a group or individual level. In fact, Dawkins has proposed that it is at the level of the [[The Extended Phenotype|''extended phenotype'']]:&lt;ref name=ExPh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bury&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=Burying the Vehicle: Commentary |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=17 |number=4 |pages=616–617 |year=1994 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/248092678/Burying-the-Vehicle#scribd |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00036207}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"We agree [referring to Wilson and Sober's book ''Unto others: The evolution and psychology of unselfish behavior''] that genes are replicators, organisms and groups are not. We agree that the group selection controversy ought to be a controversy about groups as vehicles, and we could easily agree to differ on the answer...I coined the [term] vehicle not to praise it but to bury it....Darwinism can work on replicators whose phenotypic effects (interactors) are too diffuse, too multi-levelled, too incoherent to deserve the accolade of vehicle...Extended phenotypes can include inanimate artifacts like beaver dams...But the vehicle is not something fundamental...Ask rather 'Is there a vehicle in this situation and, if so, why?'"
::—Richard Dawkins, ''Burying the Vehicle''

Although Dawkins agrees that groups can assist survival, they rank as a "vehicle" for survival only if the group activity is replicated in descendants, recorded in the gene, the gene being the only true replicator. An improvement in the survival lottery for the group must improve that for the gene for sufficient replication to occur. Dawkins argues qualitatively that the lottery for the gene is based upon a very long and broad record of events, and group advantages are usually too specific, too brief, and too fortuitous to change the gene lottery.
::"We can now see that the organism and the group of organisms are true rivals for the vehicle role in the story, but neither of them is even a ''candidate'' for the replicator role.  The controversy between ‘individual selection’ and ‘group selection’ is a real controversy between alternative vehicles...As it happens the outcome, in my view, is a decisive victory for the individual organism. The group is too wishy-washy an entity." 
::—Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&amp;pg=PA254 pp. 254-255]

Prior to the 1960s, it was common for altruism to be explained in terms of [[group selection]], where the benefits to the organism or even population were supposed to account for the popularity of the genes responsible for the tendency towards that behaviour. Modern versions of [[Multilevel selection theory|"multilevel selection"]] claim to have overcome the original objections,&lt;ref name=Korb&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal Behaviour: Evolution and Mechanisms |author=Judith Korb |chapter=§7.4—The level of selection debate: multilevel selection |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej953ZCO_Q8C&amp;pg=PA195 |pages =195 ''ff'' |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3642026232  |year=2010 |editor=Peter Kappeler}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely, that at that time no known form of group selection led to an evolutionarily stable strategy. The claim still is made by some that it would take only a single individual with a tendency towards more selfish behaviour to undermine a population otherwise filled only with the gene for altruism towards non-kin.&lt;ref name=PinkerS&gt;Pinker describes the futility of the "Public Good Game" where individuals elect not to aid the group: {{cite book |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |authorlink=Steven Pinker|author=Pinker, Steven |page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePNi4ZqYdVQC&amp;pg=PA257 |isbn=9781101200322 |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Selfish Gene'' was extremely popular when first published, causing "a silent and almost immediate revolution in biology",{{Sfn|Grafen &amp; Ridley|p=72}} and it continues to be widely read. It has sold over a million copies, and has been translated into more than 25 languages.{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006}} Proponents argue that the central point, that replicating the gene is the object of selection, usefully completes and extends the explanation of evolution given by [[Charles Darwin]] before the basic mechanisms of [[genetics]] were understood.

According to the ethologist [[Alan Grafen]], acceptance of adaptionist theories is hampered by a lack of a mathematical unifying theory and a belief that anything in words alone must be suspect.&lt;ref name=Grafen&gt;{{cite book |title=Richard Dawkins: How a scientist changed the way we think |author1link=Alan Grafen |last1=Grafen |first1=Alan |author2link=Mark Ridley (zoologist) |last2=Ridley |first2=Mark |page=68 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lH4sh2436rEC&amp;pg=PT59 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780191500770}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Grafen, these difficulties along with an initial conflict with population genetics models at the time of its introduction "explains why within biology the considerable scientific contributions it [''The Selfish Gene''] makes are seriously underestimated, and why it is viewed mainly as a work of exposition."&lt;ref name=Grafen/&gt; According to comparative psychologist Nicky Hayes, "Dawkins presented a version of sociobiology that rested heavily on metaphors drawn from animal behavior, and extrapolated these...One of the weaknesses of the sociological approach is that it tends only to seek confirmatory examples from among the huge diversity of animal behavior. Dawkins did not deviate from this tradition."&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles Of Comparative Psychology |author=Hayes, Nicky |page=33 |chapter=The "selfish gene" theory |isbn=978-1317758754 |year=2014 |edition=Digital printing of 1996 |publisher=Psychology Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tsx7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, critics argue that ''The Selfish Gene'' oversimplifies the relationship between genes and the organism. (As an example, see Thompson.&lt;ref name=Thompson2/&gt;)

''The Selfish Gene'' further popularised [[sociobiology]] in Japan after its translation in 1980.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sakura |first=Osamu |date=1 July 1998 |title=Similarities and Varieties: A Brief Sketch on the Reception of Darwinism and Sociobiology in Japan |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1006504623820 |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=341–357 |doi=10.1023/A:1006504623820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the addition of Dawkins's book to the country's consciousness, the term "meme" entered popular culture. Yuzuru Tanaka of Hokkaido University wrote a book, ''Meme Media and Meme Market Architectures'', while the psychologist [[Susan Blackmore]] wrote ''[[The Meme Machine]]'' (2000), with a foreword by Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Lectures/Japan%202005.htm |title=The Evolution of Meme Machines |authorlink=Susan Blackmore |last=Blackmore |first=Susan |date=17 May 2005 |website=Dr. Susan Blackmore |access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information scientist Osamu Sakura has published a book in Japanese and several papers in English on the topic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=遺伝子vsミーム―教育 |last=佐倉 |first=統 |publisher=廣済堂出版 |date=2001 |isbn=4331850056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.natureinterface.com/e/ni04/P026-029/ |title=What is the Evolution of Communication? -- Osamu Sakura |website=www.natureinterface.com |access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nippon Animation produced an educational television program titled ''[[Mīmu Iro Iro Yume no Tabi|The Many Journeys of Meme]]''.

In 1976, the ecologist [[Arthur Cain]], one of Dawkins's tutors at Oxford in the 1960s, called it a "young man's book" (which Dawkins points out was a deliberate quote of a commentator on the [[New College, Oxford]]{{efn|Dawkins's college.}} philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]'s ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936)). Dawkins noted that he had been "flattered by the comparison, [but] knew that Ayer had recanted much of his first book and [he] could hardly miss Cain's pointed implication that [he] should, in the fullness of time, do the same."&lt;ref name="timesexcerpt" /&gt; This point also was made by the philosopher [[Mary Midgley]]: "The same thing happened to AJ Ayer, she says, but he spent the rest of his career taking back what he'd written in ''Language, Truth and Logic''. "This hasn't occurred to Dawkins", she says. "He goes on saying the same thing.""&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mary Midgley: a late stand for a philosopher with soul  |journal=The Guardian |author=Anthony, Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/mary-midgley-philosopher-soul-human-consciousness |date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Wilkins and Hull,&lt;ref name="Hull2"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Wilkins, John S. |author2=Hull, David |title=Replication and Reproduction |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition) |editor=Zalta, Edward N. |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/replication/#DawRepVeh |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins' thinking has developed, although perhaps not defusing this criticism:

:"In Dawkins' early writings, replicators and vehicles played different but complementary and equally important roles in selection, but as Dawkins honed his view of the evolutionary process, vehicles became less and less fundamental... In later writings Dawkins goes even further and argues that phenotypic traits are what really matter in selection and that they can be treated independently of their being organized into vehicles....Thus, it comes as no surprise when Dawkins  proclaims that he "coined the term ‘vehicle’ not to praise it but to bury it."&lt;ref name=Bury/&gt; As prevalent as organisms might be, as determinate as the causal roles that they play in selection are, reference to them can and must be omitted from any perspicuous characterization of selection in the evolutionary process. Dawkins is far from a genetic ''determinist'', but he is certainly a genetic ''reductionist''."
::— John S Wilkins, David Hull, ''Dawkins on Replicators and Vehicles'', The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]

===Units of selection===
As to the [[unit of selection]]: "One internally consistent logical picture is that the unit of replication is the gene,...and the organism is one kind of ...entity on which selection acts directly."&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{cite book |title=Levels of Selection in Evolution |editor=Keller, Laurent |author1=Reeve, H. Kern |author2=Keller, Laurent  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b_iEzNFlBUC&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |chapter=Burying the debate over whether genes or individuals are the units of selection |isbn=978-0691007045 |year=1999 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins proposed the matter without a distinction between 'unit of replication' and 'unit of selection' that he made elsewhere: "the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even strictly the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity."&lt;ref name=Dawkins76A&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene  |chapter=Chapter 1: Why are people? |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |edition=30th Anniversary |isbn=978-0199291144 |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Dawkins, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continues in a later chapter:

:"On any sensible view of the matter Darwinian selection does not work on genes directly. ...The important differences between genes emerge only in their ''effects''. The technical word ''phenotype'' is used for the bodily manifestation of a gene, the effect that a gene has on the body...Natural selection favours some genes rather than others not because of the nature of the genes themselves, but because of their consequences—their phenotypic effects...But we shall now see that the phenotypic effects of a gene need to be thought of as ''all the effects that it has on the world''. ...The phenotypic effects of a gene are the tools by which it levers itself into the next generation. All I am going to add is that the tools may reach outside the individual body wall...Examples that spring to mind are artefacts like beaver dams, bird nests, and caddis houses." 
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', Chapter 13, pp. 234, 235, 238

Dawkins' later formulation is in his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' (1982), where the process of selection is taken to involve every possible [[Phenotype|phenotypical]] effect of a gene.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] finds Dawkins' position tries to have it both ways:&lt;ref name=GouldSJ&gt;{{cite book |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LMrAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA640 |pages=640–641 |isbn=978-0674417922 |year=2002 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Dawkins claims to prefer genes and to find greater insight in this formulation. But he allows that you or I might prefer organisms—and it really doesn't matter."
::— Stephen Jay Gould, ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', pp. 640-641

The view of ''The Selfish Gene'' is that selection based upon groups and populations is rare compared to selection on individuals. Although supported by Dawkins and by many others, this claim continues to be disputed.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;For a view opposing 'multilevel selection', see {{cite web |author=Pinker, Steven |authorlink=Steven Pinker |title=The false allure of group selection |url=http://edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection |work=Edge: the online version of "The Reality Club" |publisher=John Brockman |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2015}} For a more modern (and technical) argument, see {{cite journal |title=Kin selection is the key to altruism |author1=Foster, Kevin R. |author2=Wenseleers, Tom |author3=Francis L.W.

The conflict arises in part over defining concepts:

In ''[[The Social Conquest of Earth]]'' (2012), the entomologist [[E. O. Wilson]] contends that although the selfish-gene approach was accepted "until 2010 [when] Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita, and I demonstrated that inclusive fitness theory, often called kin selection theory, is both mathematically and biologically incorrect."&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Edward |title=The Social Conquest of Earth |year=2012 |publisher=Liveright Publishing |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-87140-413-8 |page=143 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StLT0zJOczkC&amp;pg=PA143}} Although it contains no reference to the "selfish gene", Wilson probably is referring to {{cite journal |title=The evolution of eusociality |author1=Nowak, M.

He criticises earlier approaches to social evolution, saying: "...unwarranted faith in the central role of kinship in social evolution has led to the reversal of the usual order in which biological research is conducted. The proven best way in evolutionary biology, as in most of science, is to define a problem arising during empirical research, then select or devise the theory that is needed to solve it. Almost all research in inclusive-fitness theory has been the opposite:  hypothesize the key roles of kinship and kin selection, then look for evidence to test that hypothesis." According to Wilson: "People must have a tribe...Experiments conducted over many years by social psychologists have revealed how swiftly and decisively people divide into groups, and then discriminate in favor of the one to which they belong." (pp.&amp;nbsp;57, 59) According to Wilson: "Different parts of the brain have evolved by group selection to create groupishness." (p.&amp;nbsp;61)

Some authors consider facets of this debate between Dawkins and his critics about the level of selection to be blather:&lt;ref name=Keller2&gt;{{cite book |title=Levels of Selection in Evolution |author1=H Kern Reeve |author2=Laurent Keller |editor=Laurent Keller |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b_iEzNFlBUC&amp;pg=PA4 |page=4 |chapter=Burying the debate over whether genes or individuals are the units of selection |isbn=978-0691007045 |year=1999 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The particularly frustrating aspects of these constantly renewed debates is that, even though they seemed to be sparked by rival theories about how evolution works, in fact they often involve only rival metaphors for the very same evolutionary logic and [the debates over these aspects] are thus empirically empty."
::— Laurent Keller, ''Levels of Selection in Evolution'', p.4

Other authors say Dawkins has failed to make some critical distinctions, in particular, the difference between group selection for group advantage and group selection conveying individual advantage.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology |author=Lloyd, Elizabeth |chapter=Units and Levels of Selection |pages=54–57 |isbn=978-1139827621 |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZOgg-x4UyIC&amp;pg=PA54 |editor1=Hull, David L. |editor2=Ruse, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choice of words===
A good deal of objection to ''The Selfish Gene'' stemmed from its failure to be always clear about "selection" and "replication". Dawkins says the gene is the fundamental unit of selection, and then points out that selection doesn't act directly upon the gene, but upon 'vehicles' or 'extended phenotypes'. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] took exception to calling the gene a 'unit of selection' because selection acted only upon [[phenotype]]s.&lt;ref name="onselfishgenesinpandasthumb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1990 |chapter=Caring Groups and Selfish Genes |title=The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=72–78 |isbn=0-393-01380-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0XY7Rg_lOwC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing the Dawkins-Gould difference of view, Sterelny says:&lt;ref name=Sterelny&gt;{{cite book |title=Dawkins ''vs.'' Gould: Survival of the Fittest |author=Sterelny, Kim |isbn=978-1840467802 |publisher=Icon Books |year=2003 |page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=vXX8VLWaJZHSoATd5IC4Cg&amp;id=LwpFAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Gould thinks gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations, they register those changes." 
::—Kim Sterelny: ''Dawkins ''vs.'' Gould'', p. 83

The word 'cause' here is somewhat tricky: does a change in lottery rules (for example, inheriting a defective gene "responsible" for a disorder) 'cause' differences in outcome that might or might not occur? It certainly alters the likelihood of events, but a concatenation of contingencies decides what actually occurs. Dawkins thinks the use of 'cause' as a statistical weighting is acceptable in common usage.&lt;ref name=DawkinsDC&gt;{{cite book |title=A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love |author=Dawkins, Richard  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loVMMlxC1XoC&amp;pg=PA106e |page=106 |chapter=§2.4 Genes aren't us |isbn=9780618485390 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Like Gould, Gabriel Dover in criticizing ''The Selfish Gene'' says:&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{cite book |title=Dear Mr. Darwin: Letters on the Evolution of Life and Human Nature |isbn=9780520227903 |year=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |author=Dover, Gabriel A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sElrZSzoLYMC&amp;pg=PA56 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"It is illegitimate to give 'powers' to genes, as Dawkins would have it, to control the outcome of selection...There are no genes for interactions, as such: rather, each unique set of inherited genes contributes interactively to one unique phenotype...the true determinants of selection".
::— Gabriel Dover: ''Dear Mr. Darwin'', p. 56

However, from a comparison with Dawkins' discussion of this very same point, it would seem both Gould's and Dover's comments are more a critique of his sloppy usage than a difference of views.&lt;ref name=Keller2/&gt; Hull suggested a resolution based upon a distinction between replicators and interactors.&lt;ref name=HullDL&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hull, David L. |title=Individuality and selection |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |year=1980 |volume=11 |pages=311–32 |url=http://www.joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/Hull%201980%20-%20Individuality%20and%20Selection.pdf |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.11.110180.001523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'replicator' includes genes as the most fundamental replicators but possibly other agents, and ''interactor'' includes organisms but maybe other agents, much as do Dawkins' 'vehicles'. The distinction is as follows:&lt;ref name=HullDL/&gt;&lt;ref name=GodfreySmith&gt;{{cite journal |author=Godfrey-Smith, Peter |title=The replicator in retrospect |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=15 |year=2000 |pages=403–423 |url=http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167win10/PGS%2000%20-%20the%20replicator%20in%20retrospect.pdf |doi=10.1023/a:1006704301415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''replicator'': an entity that passes on its structure largely intact in successive replications.
:''interactor'': an entity that interacts as a cohesive whole with its environment in such a way that this interaction ''causes'' replication to be differential.
:''selection'': a process in which the differential extinction or proliferation of interactors causes the differential perpetuation of the replicators that produced them.

Hull suggests that, despite some similarities, Dawkins takes too narrow a view of these terms, engendering some of the objections to his views. According to Godfrey-Smith, this more careful vocabulary has cleared up "misunderstandings in the "units of selection" debates."&lt;ref name=GodfreySmith/&gt;

===Enactive arguments===
[[Behavioural genetics]] entertains the view:

:"that genes are dynamic contributors to behavioral organization and are sensitive to feedback systems from the internal and external environments." "Technically behavior is not inherited; only DNA molecules are inherited. From that point on behavioral formation is a problem of constant interplay between genetic potential and environmental shaping"&lt;ref name=Thiessen&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Mechanism specific approaches in behavior genetics |author=Thiessen, D. D. |editor=Gilgen, Albert R. |title=Contemporary Scientific Psychology |page=91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIVGBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 |isbn=978-1483266183 |publisher=Academic Press |year= 2013 |edition=Reprint of 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::—D.D. Thiessen, ''Mechanism specific approaches in behavior genetics'', p. 91

This view from 1970 is still espoused today,&lt;ref name=Kelso&gt;{{cite book |title=Dynamic Patterns: The Self-organization of Brain and Behavior |chapter=Intentional dynamics |quote=To describe the gene as a program sending instructions to cells belittles the complexity of the gene...Moreover, genetic ''rearrangement'' occurs... as a result of normal processes. |page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpjejjytkiIC&amp;pg=PA140 |isbn=978-0262611312 |publisher=MIT Press |author=J.

{{cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |title= River out of Eden: A Darwinian View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmKvnPyBSoC&amp;pg=PA4 |page=4 |isbn=978-0786724260 |publisher=Basic Books  |year=2008 |edition=Paperback reprint of 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical/biological field of [[enactivism]] stresses the interaction of the living agent with its environment and the relation of probing the environment to cognition and adaptation. [[Regulation of gene expression|Gene activation]] depends upon the cellular milieu. An extended discussion of the contrasts between enactivism and Dawkins' views, and with their support by [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]], is provided by Thompson.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind in Life:  Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind |author=[[Evan Thompson]] |chapter=Chapter 7: Laying down a path in walking: Development and evolution |pages=166 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVGna4ZEpWwC&amp;pg=PA166 |isbn=978-0674025110 |year=2007 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mind in Life'', the philosopher Evan Thompson has assembled a multi-sourced objection to the "selfish gene" idea.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; Thompson takes issue with Dawkin's reduction of "life" to "genes" and "information":
:"Life is just bytes and bytes and bytes of digital information"&lt;ref name=DawkinsRE&gt;{{cite book |title= River out of Eden: A Darwinian View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmKvnPyBSoC&amp;pg=PA19 |page=19 |isbn=9780786724260 |publisher=Basic Books  |year=2008 |edition=Paperback reprint of 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::— Richard Dawkins: ''River out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life'', p. 19

:"On the bank of the Oxford canal...is a large willow tree, and it is pumping downy seeds into the air...It is raining instructions out there; it's raining programs; it's raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading algorithms. That is not a metaphor, it is the plain truth"&lt;ref name=DawkinsBW&gt;{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=The Blind Watchmaker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&amp;pg=PA111 |page=111 |isbn=978-0393315707 |year=1986 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::— Richard Dawkins: ''The Blind Watchmaker'', p. 111

Thompson objects that the gene cannot operate by itself, since it requires an environment such as a cell, and life is "the creative outcome of highly structured contingencies". Thompson quotes Sarkar:&lt;ref name="Sarkar"/&gt;

:"there is no clear technical notion of "information" in molecular biology. It is little more than a metaphor that masquerades as a theoretical concept and ...leads to a misleading picture of the nature of possible explanations in molecular biology."
::— Sahotra Sarkar ''Biological information: a skeptical look at some central dogmas of molecular biology'', p. 187

Thompson follows with a detailed examination of the concept of [[DNA]] as a look-up-table and the role of the cell in orchestrating the DNA-to-RNA [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], indicating that by anyone's account the DNA is hardly the whole story. Thompson goes on to suggest that the cell-environment interrelationship has much to do with reproduction and inheritance, and a focus on the gene as a form of "information [that] passes through bodies and affects them, but is not affected by them on its way through"&lt;ref name=DawkinsRE1&gt;{{cite book |title= River out of Eden: A Darwinian View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmKvnPyBSoC&amp;pg=PA4 |page=4 |isbn=978-0786724260 |publisher=Basic Books |year=2008 |edition=Paperback |origyear=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; is tantamount to adoption of a form of material-informational dualism that has no explanatory value and no scientific basis. (Thomson, p.&amp;nbsp;187) The [[Enactivism|enactivist]] view, however, is that information results from the probing and experimentation of the agent with the agent's environment subject to the limitations of the agent's abilities to probe and process the result of probing, and DNA is simply one mechanism the agent brings to bear upon its activity.

===Moral arguments===
Another criticism of the book is its treatment of morality, and more particularly altruism, as existing only as a form of selfishness:

:"It is important to realize that the above definitions of altruism and selfishness are ''behavioural'', not subjective. I am not concerned here with the psychology of motives...My definition is concerned only with whether the effect of an act is to lower or raise the survival prospects of the presumed altruist and the survival prospects of the presumed beneficiary." 
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', p. 12 
:"We can even discuss ways of cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism, something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world."
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', p. 179

The philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] has suggested this position is a variant of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes']] explanation of altruism as [[enlightened self-interest]], and that Dawkins goes a step further to suggest that our genetic programming can be overcome by what amounts to an extreme version of [[free will]].&lt;ref name=Midgley/&gt; Part of Mary Midgley's concern is that Richard Dawkins' account of ''The Selfish Gene'' serves as a moral and ideological justification for selfishness to be adopted by modern human societies as simply following "nature", providing an excuse for behavior with bad consequences for future human society.

Dawkins' major concluding theme, that humanity is finally gaining power over the "selfish replicators" by virtue of their intelligence, is criticized also by [[primatologist]] [[Frans de Waal]], who refers to it as an example of a "[[veneer theory]]" (the idea that [[morality]] is not fundamental, but is laid over a brutal foundation).&lt;ref name=deWaal&gt;{{cite book |last=De Waal |first=Frans |title=Primates and Philosophers: How morality evolved |quote=Dawkins waited until the very last sentence of ''The Selfish Gene'' to reassure us that, in fact, we are welcome to chuck all those genes out the window: "We alone on earth can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish gene replicators." |isbn=978-1400830336 |year=2009 |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PccMuO2pcOcC&amp;pg=PA9 |page=9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins claims he merely describes how things are under evolution, and makes no moral arguments.{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name=DawkinsMoral&gt;An extended disclaimer is found in {{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |chapter=Endnotes for p.2: ''I am not advocating a morality based upon evolution'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ICKantUfvoC&amp;pg=PA267 |pages=267–268 |edition=30th Anniversary |isbn=978-0199291144 |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Dawkins, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; On BBC-2 TV, Dawkins pointed to evidence for a [[Tit for tat|"Tit-for-Tat" strategy]] (shown to be successful in game theory&lt;ref name=Dugatkin2/&gt;) as the most common, simple, and profitable choice.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, Dennis (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_7sirll_RDUC&amp;pg=PA56 "The Not-So-Selfish Gene."] ''New Scientist'' 110 (24 Apr): 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the objection has been made that ''The Selfish Gene'' discusses philosophical and [[morality|moral]] questions that go beyond  biological arguments, relying upon anthropomorphisms and careless analogies.&lt;ref name= Kaye&gt;{{cite book |title=The Social Meaning of Modern Biology |last=Kaye |first=Howard L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aDpwfE9DO0C&amp;pg=PA137 |page=137 |isbn=978-1412838962 |publisher=Transaction Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''The Selfish Gene'' was first published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1976 in eleven chapters with a preface by the author and a foreword by [[Robert Trivers]].{{Sfn|Dawkins|1976}} A second edition was published in 1989. This edition added two extra chapters, and substantial endnotes to the preceding chapters, reflecting new findings and thoughts. It also added a second preface by the author, but the original foreword by Trivers was dropped. The book contains no illustrations.

The book has been translated into at least 23 languages including Arabic, Thai and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ti:The Selfish Gene au:Richard Dawkins|url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3AThe+Selfish+Gene+au%3ARichard+Dawkins&amp;fq=x0%3Abook+%3E+-mt%3Afic&amp;dblist=638&amp;fc=ln:_25&amp;qt=show_more_ln%3A&amp;cookie|publisher=WorldCat|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, a 30th-anniversary edition{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006}} was published with the Trivers foreword and a new introduction by the author. It was accompanied by a ''[[festschrift]]'' entitled ''[[Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think]]'' (2006). In March 2006, a special event entitled ''The Selfish Gene'': Thirty Years On was held at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Selfish Gene: Thirty years on |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/CPNSS/research/projectsCurrentlyOnHold/darwin/events/sg/Home.aspx |publisher=London School of Economics |accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Audible Inc published an audiobook edition narrated by Richard Dawkins and [[Lalla Ward]].

In 2016, Oxford University Press published a 40th anniversary edition with a new epilogue, in which Dawkins describes the continued relevance of the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|gene's eye view of evolution]] and states that it, along with [[Coalescent theory|coalescence analysis]] "illuminates the deep past in ways of which I had no inkling when I first wrote ''The Selfish Gene''...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198788607 |edition=40th Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wave cloud''' is a [[cloud]] form created by atmospheric [[internal wave]]s.

[[File:Wave Clouds from South Sandwich Islands.jpg|thumb|300 px|[[interference pattern]]s in wave clouds at the [[South Sandwich Islands]]]]

==Formation==
The atmospheric [[internal wave]]s that form wave clouds are created as stable air flows over a raised land feature such as a [[mountain range]], and can form either directly above or in the lee of the feature.   As an air mass travels through the wave, it undergoes repeated uplift and descent. If there is enough moisture in the atmosphere, clouds will form at the cooled crests of these waves.  In the descending part of the wave, those clouds will evaporate due to [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] heating, leading to the characteristic clouded and clear bands. The cloud base on the [[leeward]] side is higher than on the windward side, because precipitation on the windward side removes water from the air.&lt;ref name="Wallace, John M. 1977"&gt;Wallace, John M., Hobbs, Peter V. Atmospheric Science, and Introductory Survey. San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that simple [[convection]] from mountain summits can also form wave clouds.  This occurs as the convection forces a wave or lenticular wave cloud into the more stable air above.&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, R. M. "Lenticular wave cloud above the convective boundary layer of the Rocky Mountains," Weather 57(2002):87–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==

===Climate modeling===
Wave clouds are typically mid- to upper-tropospheric ice clouds. They are relatively easy to study, because they are quite consistent. As a result, they are being analyzed to increase our understanding of how these upper-level ice clouds influence the Earth's radiation budget. Understanding this can improve climate models.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;Baker, B. A., Lawson, R. P. (2006) In Situ Observations of the Microphysical Properties of Wave, Cirrus, and Anvil Clouds. Wave clouds got their name because they look like waves. Part I: Wave Clouds. Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences: Vol. 63, No. 12 pp. 3160–3185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recreation===
The streamlines in these clouds have the steepest slope a few kilometers downwind of the lee slope of a mountain. It is in these regions of highest vertical velocity that [[gliding|sailplanes]] can reach record-breaking altitudes.&lt;ref name="Wallace, John M. 1977"/&gt;

==Structure==
In an ideal model, a wave cloud consists of [[supercooled]] liquid water at the lower part, a mixed phase of frozen and liquid water near the ridge, and ice beginning slightly below the ridge and extending downstream. However, this doesn't always occur. Wave cloud structure ranges from smooth and simple, to jumbled phases occurring randomly.&lt;ref name="Wallace, John M. 1977"/&gt; Often, ice crystals can be found downwind of the waves. Whether this happens depends on the saturation of the air. The composition of the ice is currently an active topic of study. The main mechanism for ice formation is homogeneous [[nucleation]]. The ice crystals are mostly small spheroidal and irregular-shaped particles. Ice columns make up less than 1%,&lt;ref name=atoptics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/platcol.htm|title=Cloud Crystals - Columns &amp; Plates - Atmospheric Optics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plates are virtually nonexistent.&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt;
Multi-level mountain wave clouds form when the moisture in the air above the mountain is located in distinct layers, and vertical mixing is inhibited.

'''''Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History''''' is a 1989 book on the  [[evolution]] of [[Cambrian]] [[fauna]] by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. The volume made [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]],&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, Edwin (1989).  [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/08/books/book-notes-844389.html "Book Notes."] ''The New York Times'' Nov. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; was the 1991 winner of the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books|Rhone-Poulenc Prize]], the [[American Historical Association]]'s Forkosch Award, and was a 1991 finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Gould described his later book ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin|Full House]]'' (1996) as a companion volume to ''Wonderful Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1996). ''Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin''. New York: Harmony Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tSD60-9r7b8C&amp;pg=PA4 p. 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
[[File:Charles Doolittle Walcott (1850-1927), Sidney Stevens Walcott (1892-1977), and Helen Breese Walcott (1894-1965).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Burgess Shale]] founder [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]] (1850-1927) with his children Sidney Stevens Walcott (1892-1977), and Helen Breese Walcott (1894-1965).]]

Gould's thesis in ''Wonderful Life'' was that [[Contingency plan|contingency]] plays a major role in the [[evolutionary history of life]]. He based his argument on the extraordinarily well preserved [[fossils of the Burgess Shale]], a rich fossil-bearing deposit dating 505 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Ward, Peter]] and Joe Kirschvink (2015). ''A New History of Life.'' New York: Bloomsbury Publishing, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DA8bBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125 125.]&lt;/ref&gt; Gould argues that during this period just after the [[Cambrian explosion]] there was a greater disparity of anatomical body plans ([[phylum|phyla]]) than exist today. However most of these phyla left no modern descendants. All of the Burgess animals, Gould argues, were exquisitely adapted to their environment, and there exist little evidence that the survivors were any better adapted than their extinct contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1989) ''Wonderful Life''. New York: Norton, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=q8BUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA236 236.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gould proposed that given a chance to "rewind the tape of life" and let it play again, we might find ourselves living in a world populated by descendants of ''[[Hallucigenia]]'' rather than ''[[Pikaia]]'' (the ancestor of all vertebrates). Gould's stressed that his argument was not based on ''randomness'' but rather ''contingency''; a process by which historical outcomes arise from an unpredictable sequence of antecedent states, where any change in the sequence alters the final result.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1989). ''Wonderful Life''. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=q8BUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA283 283.]&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] for existing conditions does not guarantee [[Geologic time scale|long-term survival]] — particularly when conditions change catastrophically — the survival of many species depends more on luck than conventional features of anatomical superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (2004). [https://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/ciencias/jspinill/documentos/ECOLOGIA/lecturas/Gould-para_clase_EVOLUCION.pdf "The Evolution of Life On Earth."]
''Scientific American'' 290 (March): 97-98, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Gould maintains that, "traits that
enhance survival during an [[Extinction event|extinction]] do so in ways that are incidental and unrelated to the causes of their evolution in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1989) ''Wonderful Life''. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gwlVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA307 307.]&lt;/ref&gt; Gould earlier coined the term [[exaptation]] to describe fortuitously beneficial traits, which are [[Adaptation|adaptive]] but arise for reasons other than incremental natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Gould | first1 = S.

Gould regarded ''[[Opabinia]]''—an odd creature with five eyes and frontal nozzle—as so important to understanding the Cambrian explosion that he wanted to call his book ''Homage to Opabinia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knoll|first=A.H.|title= The First Three Billion Years of Evolution on Earth|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2004|page=192|chapter=Cambrian Redux|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Lq0S-C6zMHAC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=%22burgess+shale%22|accessdate=2009-04-22 | isbn=978-0-691-12029-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould wrote:

But none of these has taught us anywhere near so much about the nature of evolution as a little two-inch Cambrian oddball invertebrate named ''Opabinia''.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1989). ''Wonderful Life''. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=q8BUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 136.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception==
[[File:H._sparsa.jpg|thumb|right|335px|Modern artistic rendering of ''Hallucigenia''.]]
''Wonderful Life'' quickly climbed the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|national bestseller lists]] within weeks of publication.&lt;ref&gt;Mehren, Elizabeth (1989). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/mehren_wonderful-life.html "The Cosmic Lottery."] ''Los Angeles Times'' Nov. 28, pp.  E1, E6.&lt;/ref&gt; It stimulated wide discussion regarding the nature of progress and contingency in evolution. Gould's controversial thesis was that if the history of life were replayed over again, [[Human intelligence|human level intelligence]] would prove unlikely to ever arise again. In his review, the biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote that, "''Wonderful Life'' is a beautifully written and deeply muddled book. To make unputdownable an intricate, technical account of the anatomies of worms, and other inconspicuous denizens of a half-billion-year-old sea, is a literary ''tour-de-force''. But the theory that Stephen Gould wrings out of his fossils is a sorry mess."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins, Richard]] (1990).

({{ISBN|978-0-7538-1750-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] argued that Gould, "made such contingencies a major theme in ''Wonderful Life'', and I have come to the conclusion that here he may be largely right."&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (2001). ''[https://sunsetridgemsbiology.wikispaces.com/file/view/mayr-whatevolutionis.pdf/245942423/mayr-whatevolutionis.pdf What Evolution Is.]'' New York: Basic Books, p.

Biologist  [[John Maynard Smith]] wrote, "I agree with Gould that evolution is not in general predictable. … Although I agree with Gould about contingency, I find the problem of progress harder. …  I do think that progress has happened, although I find it hard to define precisely what I mean."&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, John (1992).

It is … a thrilling story that Gould tells in a way that no one else could equal."&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, Michael (2004).

Some of the anatomical reconstructions cited by Gould were soon challenged as being incorrect, most notably [[Simon Conway Morris]]' 1977 reconstruction of ''[[Hallucigenia]]''.&lt;ref name=Briggs2005&gt;{{Cite journal
