      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12361">The '''1948 Globetrotters–Lakers game''' was a dramatic match-up between the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] and the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Minneapolis Lakers]]. Played in [[Chicago Stadium]], the game took place two years before professional basketball was desegregated. The Globetrotters' 61–59 victory – by two points at the buzzer – challenged prevailing racial stereotypes about the abilities of black athletes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tricksters in the Madhouse|last=Christgau|first=John|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Globetrotters Lakers.jpg|thumb|George Mikan goes up for a shot during the 1948 Lakers–Globetrotters game.]]
The idea for the game, which was held on Feb. 19, 1948, was hatched by Globetrotters owner and coach [[Abe Saperstein]] and Lakers general manager [[Max Winter]], two friends who both believed they had the best basketball team in the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Babwin|first=Don|title=Globetrotters Played for Real in a Game that Altered History|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Globetrotters-played-for-real-in-a-game-that-3228031.php|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=February 17, 2008|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each had good reason to think so. For two decades, the Globetrotters had traveled the country winning game after game. It was because the team was so unbeatable that the players first started clowning around to make the game more interesting. When the Globetrotters arrived at the Chicago Stadium to face the Lakers, they were on a 102-game winning streak.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Ron|title=How the Harlem Globetrotters Integrated the NBA|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-harlem-globetrotters-lakers-flashback-per-20150213-story.html|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=February 14, 2015|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers, on the other hand, were a new team, formed only six months earlier. But they were already on their way to becoming a powerhouse, with two future Hall of Famers: The 6'10" [[George Mikan]], who is described by the NBA as the league's "first superstar", and [[Jim Pollard]], whose leaping ability – he could dunk from the free throw line – inspired the nickname, "The Kangaroo Kid".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/jim-pollard/|title=James C. "Jim" Pollard|last=|first=|date=|website=Basketball Hall of Fame|publisher=|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barreiro|first=Dan|title=George Mikan: The First Icon|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/mikan_icon_050602.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers, who took their name from Minnesota's designation as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes", were members of the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA), which was the precursor to the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsteamhistory.com/los-angeles-lakers/minneapolis-lakers|title=Minneapolis Lakers|last=|first=|date=|website=Sports Team History|publisher=|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a black team, the Globetrotters were not allowed into that league, or any professional league. A year earlier, [[Jackie Robinson]] had broken the color barrier in professional baseball, but basketball remained segregated. Four black basketball players had briefly been on various teams in another league, the National Basketball League. But when a fight between a white player and a black player during a game in [[Syracuse, New York]], triggered a riot in the stands, black players quietly disappeared from the league.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many sports fans, team owners, and coaches did not want to see teams integrated. Some held the racist view that blacks were not equipped for sports like basketball that required coordination, strategy, and finesse. In 1941, [[Dean Cromwell]], the assistant head coach for the U.S. track team at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], which included [[Jesse Owens]], wrote that black athletes excelled in certain events because they were closer to primitive man than white men were.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Racism dominated other aspects of the Globetrotters' lives as well. The night before the game, the team checked into the same small two-story rooming house on the segregated South Side of Chicago that they visited every time they were in town. Called Ma Piersall's, its rooms were tiny, no more than ten feet by ten feet, and featured sagging single beds. Across town, the Lakers spent the night at the popular, luxurious, high-rise Morrison Hotel where a month earlier a black actress had been denied a room and told to find a room in a "South Side hotel for colored people".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The game ==
A record number of fans showed up at Chicago Stadium to watch the Lakers face off against the Globetrotters. It was an exhibition game played right before the official Basketball Association of America contest between the [[Chicago Stags]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. Still in its infancy, professional basketball had never attracted more than 9,000 fans in Chicago. That day, nearly 18,000 filled the stadium.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Globetrotters starting lineup, a combination of the best players from Saperstein's East and West units, featured [[Goose Tatum|Reece "Goose" Tatum]], [[Marques Haynes]], Ermer Robinson, Wilbert King, and Louis "Babe" Pressley.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stewthornley.net/mplslakers_trotters.html|title=Harlem Globetrotters vs. Minneapolis Lakers|last=Thornley|first=Stew|date=1989|website=Stewthornley.net|publisher=|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1950 Minneapolis Lakers.jpeg|thumb|The Minneapolis Lakers circa 1950]]

During the first half, Laker fans had reason to gloat. Their team quickly jumped to a 9–2 lead. The Lakers held a significant height advantage over the Globetrotters, with several players towering over Tatum, the Globetrotters' star, six-foot-three center, and Haynes, who was barely six feet tall.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Tatum turned out to be no match for Mikan, the Lakers' center, who scored 18 points in the first half while preventing Tatum from scoring at all.

At halftime, Minnesota led 32–23. During the break, Saperstein and his team devised a plan to defend Mikan with two men instead of one. They also decided to fast break each time they got the ball, to tire the Lakers out. The Globetrotters knew they were in great shape, having played nearly every night for as long as they could remember. The strategy worked. With both Tatum and Pressley guarding Mikan, he was able to score only 6 points in the second half. The Globetrotters tied the game for the first time in the third quarter. On several occasions they led, only to watch the Lakers come back to tie the score.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Abe Saperstein.jpeg|thumb|Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein.]]

In the final quarter, both Tatum and Pressley fouled out from guarding Mikan so closely. The rest of the team picked up the slack. With 90 seconds left, the Lakers tied the game at 59 with a free throw. When the Globetrotters got the ball, Marques Haynes, who earlier in the game had teased the Lakers by dribbling while lying down on the court, dribbled to run out the clock, since there was no shot clock at the time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was easy for Haynes: He once dribbled an entire fourth quarter to overcome a two-player handicap and sustain the Globetrotters' one-point lead.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

With only a few seconds left, Haynes flipped the ball to Ermer Robinson, who was stationed 30 feet from the basket. Flexing his knees and holding the ball to his chest, Robinson let fly the one-handed shot he had practiced hundreds of times a day on his childhood courts in San Diego. It was the same shot he had already missed three times in a row, and none from that far out. But this time the ball went in, hitting nothing but net. Screaming fans poured onto the court. When the Globetrotters reached their locker room, they hoisted Saperstein, who was wearing double-breasted suit and wide tie, onto their shoulders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A year later, the Lakers and Globetrotters met for a rematch, with the Globetrotters again winning, this time 49–45. The teams met six more times after that, with the Lakers winning each of those games.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== The aftermath ==
The racial implications of the game were not immediately apparent. The ''Chicago Sun-Times''{{'}} headline, "Mikan Cooks Tatum's Goose", focused on the fact that the Globetrotter star only scored three baskets. Neither Saperstein nor Winter saw the game as being about race relations; they simply wanted to see which team was best.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "I'm positive that he [Abe] didn't see it as a racial game", Gerald Saperstein, a cousin of Abe Saperstein's who was at the game, told the Associated Press.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

But to many team owners in the young and struggling basketball leagues, there was a clear message: Not only were black players as talented and capable as white players, they added a level of excitement to the game that appealed to both white and black audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To black basketball fans, it was a moment of empowerment. "It just revitalized so many of us, from the fact that [it showed] what we can be", said [[John Chaney (basketball, born 1932)|John Chaney]], the former longtime [[Temple University]] basketball coach who, in 1948, was a teenager in deeply segregated [[Jacksonville, Florida]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Two years later, in 1950, three former Globetrotters became the first black players on NBA teams. The [[Boston Celtics]] drafted [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]], the New York Knicks signed center [[Nathaniel Clifton|Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton]], and the Tri-Cities Blackhawks (now the [[Atlanta Hawks]]) took [[Hank DeZonie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=They Cleared the Lane: The NBA's Black Pioneers|last=Thomas|first=Ron|publisher=Bison Books|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As basketball became integrated, giving talented black players greater opportunity to play professionally, the Globetrotters had fewer recruits to choose from. Rather than try to compete with the NBA, Abe Saperstein transformed the Globetrotters into a touring act, first against teams of all-star college players around the country and then with ambitious tours of Europe, South America, and the rest of the world. The Globetrotters also expanded their dazzling ball handling and shooting tricks, cementing their reputation as "the magicians of basketball".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spinning the Globe: The Rise, Fall, and Return to Greatness of the Harlem Globetrotters|last=Green|first=Ben|publisher=Amistad|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers went on to become an outstanding team, winning six professional basketball titles in the next seven years: 1948 (NBL), 1949 (BAA), 1950 (NBA), 1952 (NBA), 1953 (NBA), 1954 (NBA). When Mikan retired in 1954, the team struggled financially. To boost attendance and revenue, then-owner Bob Short relocated the team to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Basketball's Original Dynasty: The History of the Lakers|last=Thornley|first=Stew|publisher=Nodin Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago Stadium, the venue of the first Globetrotter-Lakers game, was demolished in 1995. The impact of that game, however, was felt for many years to come. "Those Lakers-Trotters games definitely contributed to the integration of the league", basketball historian Claude Johnson told ESPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howard|first=Johnette|title=Why Minneapolis Lakers' loss to Globetrotters was so meaningful|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/16211736/when-lakers-were-minneapolis-loss-globetrotters-was-blow-segregation|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures, LLC|website=ESPN.com|date=August 25, 2016|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alternative Bank Switzerland''' (ABS) is a [[sustainability]]-oriented [[bank]] based in [[Olten]], [[Canton of Solothurn]], in Switzerland.

It is situated at the former location of the [[Walter Verlag]]. Its aim is clearly not to maximize profit, but to promote and social or ecological businesses and projects.

== History and orientation ==
The Alternative Bank Switzerland (ABS) is the ''everyday banking for those who want to know what is happening with their money and how it can make even good work'' declares the bank. It was founded in 1990 by several organisations, a union, various charities, among them [[Greenpeace Switzerland]] and [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), and also initiated by the [[Public Eye (Erklärung von Bern)|Erklärung von Bern]] (EvB, renamed "Public Eye" in 2016) association. Since 1990 the ABS has evolved from an alternative operation with a few people to a hierarchically structured company with departments and supervisors. The ''bank had also to say goodbye to some ideals'', so it could ''not support people that make no money, just because they have a ‹good ethological opinion›''. As some years ago, some cooperatively organized enterprises got in bankruptcy after the founding, ''it was sobering for the bank's staff. ABS survived this turmoil without saying goodbye to their core values''. Regardless, the ABS shares in today's banking environment continuously gained value, so ''[[sustainability]] is expressed also in sustainable growth''.&lt;ref name=WOZ2012&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.woz.ch/1217/gute-finanzinstitute/die-banken-die-auch-anders-koennen|title=Gute Finanzinstitute: Die Banken, die auch anders können.|publisher=[[Die Wochenzeitung WOZ]] 17/2012|author=Susan Boos and Ursula Häne (photos)|language=German|date=2012-04-26|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, over the years the ABS threw some strict requirements over board. So they did not want to grant loans for single-family homes, but ceased in the late of 1990s that otherwise customers would be lost. In order to fulfil their founding goals, the ABS introduced a private real estate rating, resulting in favourable loans for social and ecological buildings.&lt;ref name=WOZ2012/&gt;

== Investment strategy ==
Investing their customers' money involves difficult ethical decisions for the ABS: which stocks should be bought, which titles are all right, which are not? The economist Martin Rohner, former director of the [[Max Havelaar Foundation]] (Switzerland), has been the ABS'S managing director since 2012. ABS has "green and red lists" for their investment strategy, the latter including companies dealing with weapons, the nuclear industry, or which earn money with gene technology, as well as the porn industry in general. For example, corporations that produce environmentally friendly cars, or a pharmaceutical company, which uses genetic engineering but at the same time provides affordable medicines for the poor – are categorized using an extensive list including: eligibility criteria, exclusion criteria and positive criteria. The ABS does not publish its rating list, but for customers, however, this is accessible. Today, after the ABS has served as model since the 1990s, almost all banks offer so-called sustainable, ethical funds. However, for the ABS ethical standards are far more than just a marketing strategy. It uses the ''triple-bottom-line ‹People-planet-profit›,'' ideology, which means a strict adherence to ensuring the economy is a means to an end, and not for earning high profits. Banks should meet the needs of the people, without destroying the world.&lt;ref name=WOZ2012/&gt;

== Microfinancing ==
In March 2009, eleven ethical banks formed a global alliance to strengthen alternatives to the crisis-shaken conventional financial model. The new network was launched in the Netherlands, and ABS was a founding member of the [[Global Alliance for Banking on Values]]. The members also include Bangladesh (BRAC Bank), Peru (Mibanco), USA (ShoreBank Corporation), Germany (GLS Bank), Mongolia (XacBank) comprising, as of 2009, about 12,000 million [[Swiss franc]]s assets and seven million customers in 20 countries to form the Global Alliance. Its goals include ''solidar economic cooperation, long-term action and responsible income''.&lt;ref name="abs-globalalliance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abs.ch/de/ueber-die-abs/die-abs-aktuell/aktuelle-meldungen/news/2009/03/13/global-alliance-for-banking-on-values-gegruendet/|title=Global Alliance for Banking on Values gegründet |publisher=ABS|author=|language=German|date=2009-03-13|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABS offers to their customers a bank account to support [[Microfinance|microfinancing]], the so-called ''Oikocredit-Förderkonto'' in co-operation with international partners. To provide this account, in November 2016 the Netherlands-based [[Oikocredit]] announced partnership with ABS.&lt;ref name="oikocredit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oikocredit launches banking partnership with social bank ABS in Switzerland|url=http://www.oikocredit.coop/k/n171/news/view/166668/8951/oikocredit-launches-banking-partnership-with-social-bank-abs-in-switzerland.html|publisher=Oikocredit|date=2016-11-16|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oikocredit is thus financing partner organizations in over 70 developing and emerging countries. These, for example, grant small loans to women to build up self-employment or loans to small businesses. ABS jointly promotes sustainable development and guarantees the balances on the promotion account to the same extent as for a savings account.&lt;ref name="abs-microfinance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abs.ch/de/privatpersonen/sparen-vorsorgen/oikocredit-kampagne/|title=Oikocredit-Förderkonto|publisher=ABS|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Weissgeldstrategie'' ==
The ABS also clearly differentiate at the time of its founding by conventional Swiss banks, by is its strategy, as today in general called ''Weissgeldstrategie'', literally meaning "white money strategy":&lt;ref name="srf-weissgeld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/news/wirtschaft/wie-ernsthaft-verfolgen-banken-die-weissgeldstrategie|title=Wie ernsthaft verfolgen Banken die Weissgeldstrategie?|publisher=Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen SRF|author=|language=German|date=2014-07-24|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; All customers from Switzerland and from abroad must declare, that the money they bring to the ABS, is tax paid. For five years, the Alternative Bank Schweiz also reports interest income from non-Swiss assets unsolicited to the tax authorities of the home countries of the foreign clientele. Customers must give their consent, but if they do not comply, they cannot open an account at the ABS. In principle, this corresponds to the automatic exchange of information require more and more countries of the Switzerland to combat tax evasion.&lt;ref name=WOZ2012/&gt;

== Negative interest rates ==
The ABS was the first bank in Switzerland that introduced [[Interest rate#Negative interest rates|negative interest rates]] for assets on the accounts of their  retail banking customers: From 1 January 2016, they have to pay 0.125% on the ordinary accounts for private payments.&lt;ref name="srf-20151016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/news/wirtschaft/erste-schweizer-bank-verlangt-zins-fuer-bankguthaben|title=Erste Schweizer Bank verlangt Zins für Bankguthaben|publisher=[[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen]] SRF|author=Jan Baumann|language=German|date=2015-10-16|accessdate=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABS responded to the introduction of negative interest rates by the [[Swiss National Bank]] and, since 1 April 2015, the ABS for the time being paid no more interest on all settlement accounts. Since end of January 2015, the Swiss banks have to pay on their deposits with the National Bank (SNB) an interest rate of 0.75%.&lt;ref name="abs-feb2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abs.ch/de/ueber-die-abs/die-abs-aktuell/aktuelle-meldungen/einzelansicht/news/2015/02/24/nationalbank-zwingt-abs-zum-handeln/|title=Nationalbank zwingt ABS zum Handeln|publisher=Alternative Bank Schweizer|author=|language=German|date=2015-02-24|accessdate=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy and organization ==
The [[balance sheet]] total grew to 2012 by 10% to 1,120 million Swiss francs. The profit rose by 55% to nearly 6 million Swiss francs in 2012. 90 employees take care of around 33,224 customers as of 2014. Thus, in the national comparison the ABS is a small bank; in comparison, the [[Raiffeisen (Switzerland)|Raiffeisen bank]] has a total assets of 15,500 million francs, 3.5 million customers and about 8,000 employees.&lt;ref name=WOZ2012/&gt; 44% of the ABS management positions are staffed with women, which represents an extremely high rate in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=ABS-zahlen/&gt;

The ABS is organized as an [[Aktiengesellschaft]] according to Swiss law. Originally, the founders planned to organize the bank as a [[cooperative]], but the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority]] did not allow to grant any new [[cooperative bank]]. In fact this legal disadvantage makes it thus easier for ABS to find new shareholders, because share holder value may easier to be sold to new owners as the planned cooperative shares. Therefore, the ABS may also award a modest dividend.&lt;ref name=WOZ2012/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3263">'''Aluku''' is a [[Bushinengue]] ethnic group living mainly on the riverbank in [[Maripasoula]] in southwest [[French Guiana]].  The group is sometimes called Boni, referring to a notorious leader, [[Boni (guerrilla leader)|Bokilifu Boni]] (described as a former mulatto slave).

== History ==
The Aluku is a legendary ethnic group in [[French Guiana]] whose people are descended in part from African slaves who escaped in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries from the Dutch plantations in what is now known as [[Suriname]]. Toward the end of the eighteenth century, they settled alongside the riverbanks of Lawa [[Maroni]], which now forms the border between [[French Guiana]] and [[Suriname]].  There were at least two other groups of escaped Africans in the area, The [[Saramaka|Saramaka people]] and the [[Ndyuka people]], who  eventually assimilated with the Aluku to form a new ethnic group.

In the late eighteenth century, the Aluku occupied the region of [[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]], [[Apatou]], [[Grand-Santi]]; the largest piece of the territory still occupied is called ''Fochi-ké'' (First Cry), better known as Aluku, located in the region of [[Maripasoula]], consisting of:
* the municipalities and city of [[Maripasoula]] and the capital city of [[Papaïchton]], and the traditional villages of Kormontibo, Assissi, Loca, Tabiki, and Agoodé, in French Guiana;
* [[Cottica]], in Suriname.

There is also a very large Aluku population in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, [[Cayenne]], [[Matoury]], and [[Kourou]].

== Culture ==
Traditionally, the Aluku people lived by hunting and gathering and fishing. Currently they appear to have succumbed to modernity, the market economy, and a society of consumption. Some are hired as river boat drivers by the Army. According to Bernard Delpech (in ''Les Cahiers d’Outre-Mer'', nº 182), the Aluku have undergone "destabilization of the basic traditional material, cultural transformation, altering the rules of collective life".

Aluku is the [[eponym]]ous term for their language, which may have more than 5,000 speakers;{{cn|date=April 2015}} however, the 1980 census in French Guiana did not reveal exact counts, as many of the responders were also bilingual with French.

The Aluku language is a creole of [[English language|English]] (inherited from the British colonies in  Suriname) as well as Dutch, African languages, and more recently French.  It was influenced by the languages spoken by the Pamaka and Ndjuka, and it is similar to the languages spoken by the [[Paramaccan]] and [[Kwinti]] and the [[Jamaican Patois]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13719">The '''Anaang''' (also spelled '''Annang''') is a cultural and ethnic group native to "South South" [[Geopolitical zones of Nigeria|geopolitical zone in Nigeria]].  The Anaang people are indigenes of 8 local government areas of the present 31 local government areas in Akwa Ibom State. (Akwa Ibom State [[Akwa Ibom State#Administrative areas|Local Government Areas]]), namely [[Abak]], [[Essien Udim]], [[Etim Ekpo]], [[Ika, Nigeria|Ika]], [[Ikot Ekpene]], [[Obot Akara]], [[Oruk Anam]], [[Ukanafun]] in [[Akwa Ibom State]] , and part of [[Obi Ngwa]] L.g.a of Abia state, e.g Akirika and others,  Nigeria. They were formerly located in the former [[Abak]] and [[Ikot Ekpene]] Divisions of the Anaang Province, in the former Eastern Region of Nigeria. The proper name for the [[Ika people|Ika]] of [[Akwa Ibom]] is [[Ika-Annang]].

Population; over 8.1 million Native speakers

==Location==
The Anaang people are located in South South [[Nigeria]] and specifically [[Akwa Ibom State]].  The political capital of the Anaang people is Ikot Ekpene Local Government Area. 

==Culture==
Anaang society is [[patriarchal]]. Individuals locate their place in the social world from the ''Idip'', literally translated as "womb". Thus a brother/sister from the same ''Idip'' means that they can trace their origin to the same mother or father. Since [[polygamy]] is practised in the society, those who can so trace their ancestry to the same parents form ''Ufok'' (literally a house or compound). Several ''ufoks'' make up ''Ekpuks'' or [[extended family]] and several ''Ekpuks'' (extended families) make up "Idung" (meaning village) and several villages make up the "''abie''" or clan.

Leadership at the family, lineage, village, or clan level remains the prerogative of the men, and lineage ties extends to women even after marriage. There are many societies and associations (''Urim'' also called "udim") for men and women which are very important in traditional village life. Individuals are measured by both the number and types of memberships in ''Urim'' and by the achievements of one or more ''Urims''.  Governance is done by elderly males who act as the legislative arm called Afe Isong, directed by the ''Obong''  or ''Abong Ichong'' (Village Chief and Clan Chief) who is the head and the chief executive but without the authority beyond what the ''Afe Ichong'' gives. A chief can be appointed by the ''Afe'' or can be an inherited office. 

The Anang speak the [[Annang language]] and perform a masquerade after the yam harvest to mark the visit of ancestral spirits, or ''ekpo''. This is also the name of a men's associations that once had great influence among Ibibio groups. The Anang carve masks with grotesque features, known as ''idiok'', which are considered dangerous and may only be viewed by members of the ''ekpo''. Other masks embody the beautiful spirit, or ''mfon''.&lt;ref name="masks"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hahner-Herzog |first1=Iris |last2=Kecskési |first2=Maria |last3=Vajda |first3=László |date=1998|title=African masks from the Barbier-Mueller Collection, Geneva|publisher=Prestel|location=Munich|isbn=978-3-7913-1806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of any individual, family (or group for that matter) is typically based upon a consensus of the village or clan through this complex social system.  In all this, Anang women are not completely subordinate to men.  Instead Anaang women are partners and leaders in many aspects of Anaang tradition, including serving as female chief priests "Abia Idiong" in the Idiong cult or as healers in the healing cults.  The first-born female known as ''Adiaha'' is important and commands respect in the family and lineage.  Some traditions hold that a woman's first birth should take place in her mother's compound.  Women's organizations such as "abi-de" and "Nyaama", and "Isong Iban"  play important roles in giving the women voice and status in society. There are no traditional or cultural barriers that prevent women from attaining high offices or positions.

Anaangs value the ability to speak well and oratory ability using [[proverb]]s is highly desirable, especially among the leaders. The American anthropologist, [[Peter Farb]], stated that the name "Anaang" among this group means "they who speak well". An individual who has the gift of eloquent speech is often complimented as ''Akwo Anaang'', meaning the "singer of Anaang".&lt;ref&gt;Farb, P. (1974) Word Play: What Happens when People Talk. New York. Alfred Knopf Publishers {{ISBN|0-679-73408-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fattening room===
The fattening room is traditionally where virgin adolescent girls were fattened up in preparation for marriage. A fattening room girl is known as a ''mbobo''. This was an occasion for a major village celebration. As part of her preparation for marriage the girl was also instructed on how to be a wife. She would spend her time in the room naked so that her fattening could be observed, and would sleep on a bamboo bed which was thought to fatten her up. It was also meant to make it more possible for her to conceive easily.

This use for fertility purposes was also used at time for infertile wives and as a prerequisite for entrance into secret societies.&lt;ref name=Brink&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Aspects of Obesity|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-2884491853|pages=71–84|author=Pamela J Brink|editor=I.De Garine and Nancy J. Pollock|chapter=Fertility and Fattening: the Annang Fattening Room}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Oral history===
According to oral tradition, the Abiakpo came to the northern range of Anaang from Eka Abiakpo. They were quickly followed by the Ukana clan, the Utu, Ekpu, Ebom and Nyama (the [[British people|British]] lumped these groups together and gave them the name Otoro), and other Anaang clans. The Anaang and the entire people of Akwa Ibom and Cross River States of Nigeria (AkwaCross people) have occupied their land in the coastal Southeastern Nigeria for thousands of years.

The group is related to the [[Efik people|Efiks]] and the [[Ibibios]]. Migration brought the groups to live among the [[Akan people|Twi]] of [[Ghana]] where the name Anaang means "fourth son". From Ghana, the group moved eastward into present-day [[Cameroon]]. It was in the Cameroon highlands that the group broke off but later arrived at same territory in the Coastal Southeastern [[Nigeria]]. Lineages were recognized and the groups organized themselves into clans based on old family origins known as Iman, a similar structure extends into the land of their northern neighbors, the [[Igbo people|Igbo]].

===Written history===
Very little was written about the Anaang people before the mid-19th century. Early European traders who arrived in the cross river territories referred to groups who lived outside of the coastal areas as residents of Egbo-Sharry Country. The first written mention of the Anaangs is in [[Sigismund Koelle]]'s account of liberated slaves in [[Sierra Leone]]. He mentioned a liberated slave named ''Ebengo'' who hailed from Nkwot in [[Abak]]. Ebengo was captured and sold to the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] but was subsequently freed by a British warship and later settled in [[Waterloo, Sierra Leone]]. The British soldiers listed the languages spoken by the slaves in that captured ship as "Anaang". The second mention is a description of what is known as the Ikot Udo Obong Wars. The British described the killings of the Anaangs by King ''Jaja'' of [[Opobo]] as a punishment for defying his orders and trading in palm oil directly with the British merchants instead of going through him as a middle man. In the war that ensued, the British intervened and with the help of the Anaangs, they captured King Jaja and exiled him to the [[West Indies]]. The British established a military post at [[Ikot Ekpene]] in 1904.

Following [[British colonialism]] and with changes and ban in ancient hunting practices, the Anaang witnessed attacks by wild animals. As the men went to fight in [[World War II]] these attacks intensified. The British authorities called the attacks murder and blamed it on "the barbarism of the Africans". The Anaang were accused of belonging to a secret society called ''Ekpeowo'' ([[Leopard Society|The Human Leopards Society]]). It has been argued that killings born out of insurgency against the British elsewhere in Africa led to the branding of leopard attacks as murders by the British authorities among the Anaang. Between 1945 and 1948 about 196 people were killed in [[Ikot Okoro]] community in the present-day Oruk Anam LGA; the [[Ikot Okoro]] Police station was set up because of this reason. The British convicted 96 people and executed 77 innocent people. The Anaang religion called Idiong was banned and the priests arrested. Articles and worship materials were publicly burnt and those who did not convert to Christianity automatically became suspects.

The Anaangs have a history and reputation for fearlessness and the ability of villages and clans to bind together to fight a common enemy. This is perhaps why they were able to thrive living so close to the [[Aro Confederacy]]'s center, [[Arochukwu]] with its famed [[Ibini Ukpabi]] oracle. A particular interesting war group, or "Warrior cult", was the famous Oko warriors. This war group was highly functional in the 1950s. These warriors were considered invulnerable to penetration of knives, spears, and arrows. In various instances sharp machetes were tested on the body parts of members.

The Anaangs suffered [[genocide]] during the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. The war lasted for three years (1967–1970) and the Anaang lost a significant number of its people. The effect of the war and the resulting neglect of the Anaang is now a serious political issue and a source of unrest in the area.

==Written language==
Parts of the [[Annang language]] may be intelligible to speakers of [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]], [[Oro language|Oron]], [[Eket]] (also known as [[Ekid]]) of the [[Akwa Akpa|Old Calabar Kingdom]]. Though the Anaang speech pattern was not written down, linguists have now produced an orthography of the language which makes it possible to produce written materials in the language (Idem-Agozino &amp; Udondata, 2001).
In Annang dialect,the word "ilung"means village while in Ibibio it is called " Idung". The major linguistic difference between the Annang and other dialects is the predominant use of the letter "L" in place of "r" or "d",and the use of "g" in place of "w".The Annang dialect sounds hard but it is a dialect of freewill,ie the words roll out easily from your tongue than the Ibibio.

The '''''Assisted Human Reproduction Act''''' (the ''Act'') is law enacted by the Parliament of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''Assisted Human Reproduction Act'', S.C. 2004, c. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to regulate assisted human reproduction (AHR) and related research.  It is one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation in the world concerning reproductive technologies and related research. It was introduced and passed in 2004 and was fully in force by 2007.

The ''Act'' was meant to provide Canadians with a system of [[licensing]], [[surveillance|monitoring]], [[inspection]] and [[enforcement]] of activities relating to AHR in order to protect and promote Canadians' health, safety and values. It identifies prohibited activities, as well as controlled activities, which are AHR activities that can be performed in Canada but require a licence and adherence to the regulations.&lt;ref name="Paterson2014"&gt;Stephanie Paterson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LZHdAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164 Fertile Ground: Exploring Reproduction in Canada]''. MQUP; June 2014. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-9212-4}}. p. 164–.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2010 Supreme Court case that ruled that certain sections of the Act exceeded the federal government's legislative power means that the scope of the Act's regulatory framework was significantly reduced (see below).

==Constitutional validity==

{{main|Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act}}

On December 22, 2010, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared some sections of the ''Assisted Human Reproduction Act'' unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.org/en/2010/2010scc61/2010scc61.html Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act, 2010 SCC 61] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104204506/http://scc.lexum.org/en/2010/2010scc61/2010scc61.html |date=2011-11-04 }}, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 457&lt;/ref&gt; It was ruled that the sections listed below exceeded the [[Canadian federalism|legislative jurisdiction]] of the [[Parliament of Canada]] under the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'':

* 10,11,13: Certain provisions regarding controlled activities
* 14-18: Certain provisions regarding privacy and access to information
* 40(2), 40(3), 40(3.1), 40(4), 40(5), 44(2), 44(3): Certain provisions regarding administration

===Prohibited activities===
Prohibited activities, defined in sections 5 to 9 of the ''Act'', are AHR activities that Parliament has determined to be ethically unacceptable or incompatible with Canadian values, or to pose significant risks to the health, safety and values of Canadians. These activities are not allowed in Canada. Prohibitions include:
*Creating an ''in vitro'' embryo for any purpose other than creating a human being or improving or providing instruction in assisted reproduction procedures
*Human cloning.
*Pre-selecting or increasing the probability that an embryo will be a particular sex (except to prevent a sex-linked genetic condition).
*Transplanting a sperm, egg, embryo or foetus of a non-human life form into a human being, or using a sperm, egg, or ''in vitro'' embryo that was transplanted into a non-human life form to create a human being
*Creating a hybrid for the purpose of reproduction, or transplanting a hybrid into a human being or non-human life form
*Creating a chimera for any purpose, or transplanting a chimera into a human being or non-human life form
*Using gametes or ''in vitro'' embryos without the consent of the donor of the gametes or embryo
*Obtaining gametes from a person under 18 years of age (except for own use preservation purposes)
*Paying, offering to pay, or advertising payment for sperm, eggs or ''in vitro'' embryos from donors or for the services of surrogate mothers (including payment to a third party for arranging for the services of a surrogate mother)

This last prohibition prevents the "commercialization" of human reproduction in Canada. While the ''Act'' currently allows donors and surrogate mothers to be reimbursed for legitimate expenses, [[Health Canada]] is developing specific regulations about what constitutes a legitimate expenditure.

===Controlled activities===
Controlled activities, set out in sections 10 to 12 of the ''Act'', are AHR activities permitted if performed in accordance with regulations and by a licensed clinic or individual in licensed premises. However, section 10, which addressed the "use of human reproductive material," and section 11, which addressed "transgenics," were ruled ''ultra vires''. Section 12, which addresses the "reimbursement of expenditures" for providing gametes and surrogacy services, is ''intra vires'' but is not yet in force.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1875">The '''Association of British Scrabble Players''' oversees competitive [[Scrabble]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It was formed in 1987 by agreement with [[J W Spear &amp; Sons]], the game's trademark owner, who were subsequently bought out by [[Mattel]] in 1993. It currently has around 600 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wespa.org/assoc/ wespa.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805165802/http://www.wespa.org/assoc/ |date=August 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABSP controls a rating system containing the names of over 2,000 people who have played in Scrabble tournaments around the country. The Association also maintains a calendar of these events, handles publicity for them and many other Scrabble-related events and actively pursues sponsorship and the development of tournament Scrabble in the UK.

The honorary president of the Association is former [[Member of Parliament]] [[Gyles Brandreth]], who founded the first [[National Scrabble Championship (UK)|British National Scrabble Championship]] in 1971 and has taken a keen interest in the game ever since. Former ABSP Chairman [[Allan Simmons]] is a prolific Scrabble author and the ABSP website was formerly maintained by ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'' series champion [[Stewart Holden]], who now holds the post of publicity officer for the association.

The current ABSP chairperson is Amy Byrne.

'''Ayacucho''' (also called '''Chanca''' or '''Chanka''')&lt;ref&gt;after the former Chancas local tribe that dominated the area before Incan conquest&lt;/ref&gt; is a variety of [[Southern Quechua]] spoken in the [[Ayacucho Region]], [[Peru]], as well as by immigrants from Ayacucho in [[Lima]]. With roughly a million speakers, it is the largest variety of Southern Quechua after [[Cusco Quechua]]. The literary standard of Southern Quechua is based on these two closely related Quechua varieties.

Spanish Loanwords

Ayacucho Quechua has three vowels: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}, which are rendered by native speakers as {{IPA|[æ]}}, {{IPA|[ɪ]}}, and {{IPA|[ʊ]}} respectively. When these vowels appear adjacent to the uvular fricative {{IPA|/χ/}}, they are lowered (with {{IPA|[æ]}} instead being produced further back), yielding {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} respectively. In bilingual speakers, the Spanish realizations {{IPA|[a]}}, {{IPA|[i]}}, and {{IPA|[u]}} may also be found.

Notable differences from Cusco Quechua:
* There are no [[Ejective consonant|ejective stops]]. See [[Quechuan languages#Phonology|Cusco Phonology]] for examples of ejective consonants.
* '''q''' represents the uvular fricative {{IPA|/χ/}} rather than the uvular stop {{IPA|/q/}} of Cusco. The '''q''' grapheme is kept merely to allow for easy comparison due to its use with other Quechua languages.
* Ayacucho Quechua lacks the characteristic [[Lenition|spirantization]] of stops at the end of a syllable; compare Cusco ''ñuqanchis'' with Ayacucho ''ñuqanchik'' "we/you and I".

Ayacucho Quechua has borrowed hundreds of words from Spanish, and some speakers (even monolinguals) approximate the Spanish pronunciation. For such speakers, {{IPA|/f/ /rr/ /b/ /d/ /ɡ/ /e/ /o/}} are phonemes in borrowed words like ''libru'' (from Spanish ''libro'' "book") or ''serbey'' (from Spanish ''servir'' "to serve")

=== Stress Rules and Syllable Structure  ===
Quechua primary (strong) stress regularly falls on the penultimate syllable (if a word has more than one syllable). It may also occur on the final syllable, in which case it is directly indicated by the acute diacritic. In slow speech, weak stress tends to fall on the first syllable of a word.

All phonemes appear in word initial position, though vowel clusters are not allowed, and word initial consonant clusters occur only in words borrowed from Spanish (these clusters are ''bl''-, ''br''-, ''bw''-, ''by''-, ''pl''-, ''pr''-, ''pw''-, ''py''-, ''dy'',  ''dr''-, ''ty''-, ''tr''-, ''gr''-, ''gl''-, ''gw''-, ''kr''-, ''kl''-, ''kw''-, ''fr''-, ''fl''-, ''sp''-, ''sk''-, "st"-, "sw"- and ''sy''-). The consonants ''h'', and ''ñ'' cannot occur in word-final position (as well as borrowed Spanish consonants ''b'', ''g'', and ''f''). This leads to a minimal possible syllable of V (only word initially) and a maximal native syllable of CVC ''ñan'' (with the prohibited consonants unable to appear in the final position), and a maximal possible syllable of CCVC ''kreyey'' (from Spanish ''creer'' "to believe").

==Morphology==

===Substantive Morphology===

====Overview====
Quechua is a largely [[agglutination|agglutinative language]] and nouns can be modified by many [[affix]]es (mostly suffixes) which can mark the case of a [[noun]] or derive a new word. Some suffixes are possible in combination, such as ''-pa'' + ''-ta'', ''ñuqapata'', "to my place". Pronouns are marked with the same suffixes as regular nouns, as in ''-ñuqa'' "I", ''-ñuqa-pa'' "my".

====Personal Pronouns====
{| class="wikitable"
! rowspan=1 | 
! colspan=1 | &amp;nbsp;[[Grammatical number|Singular]]&amp;nbsp;
! colspan=2 | &amp;nbsp;[[Grammatical number|Plural]]&amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp;'''[[Grammatical person|1st Person]]'''&amp;nbsp;
| align=center | ñuqa
| align=center | ñuqanchik
| align=center | ñuqayku
|-
| &amp;nbsp;'''[[Grammatical person|2nd Person]]'''&amp;nbsp;
| colspan=1 align=center | qam
| colspan=2 align=center | qamkuna
|-
| &amp;nbsp;'''[[Grammatical person|3rd Person]]'''&amp;nbsp;
| align=center | pay 
| colspan=2 align=center | paykuna
|}
The first person plural pronouns Ayacucho Quechua are divided into [[clusivity|inclusive and exclusive pairs]]. ''Ñuqanchik'', the inclusive pronoun, means "we" and includes the person to whom the speaker is talking, as in "you and I". The exclusive pronoun, ''ñuqayku'', also means "we", but does not include the listener, meaning approximately "we but not you".

====Case Marking====
Ayacucho Quechua substantives are marked for eleven [[grammatical case]]s, which are also conveyed through the use of suffixes. These suffixes may be placed onto nouns, numerals, pronouns, and—with an adverbial meaning—on adjectives and adverbs.

*'''''-ta''''' marks the object or goal of a [[transitivity (grammatical category)|transitive verb]]. This includes the direct object in sentences like ''wasi'''ta''' qawan'' "he watches the house". It also has an adverbial function with adjectives (e.g. ''allin'' "good" → ''allin'''ta''''' "well"), numbers in telling time, adverbs, and adverbial nouns (e.g. ''punchaw'' "day" → ''punchaw'''ta''''' "by day").
*'''''-pi''''' marks [[locative case|location]] in, on, at, or within the noun to which it is attached (e.g. ''wasi'''pi''''' "in the house"). When attached to an adverbial noun, ''-pi'' acquires the meaning "during", as in ''setembri'''pi''''' "during September". When suffixed to a nominalized verbal, it means "while", as in ''suyasqam'''pi''''' "while he waited". Additionally, ''-pi'' can be affixed to adjectives to indicate an adverbial function (e.g. ''katulika'''pi''' kasarakunqa'' "they'll get married in a Catholic church".
*'''''-pa''''' marks the [[genitive case]] (e.g. ''wasi'''pa''''' "the house's; of the house". A number of adverbials can also be formed from nouns + ''-pa'' (e.g. ''waqta'' "side" → ''waqta'''pa''''' "on its side, sideways".
*'''''-man''''' means almost the same as "-ta" but it is related with movement (e.g. "wasiman rin" "he goes to the house"). It marks the direction towards a noun for a non-human actor (e.g. ''kay ñanmi ayakuchu'''man''' riq'' "this road goes to Ayacucho").
*'''''-manta''''' (which is not composed of the individual suffixes ''-man'' and ''-ta'') marks [[ablative case|motion away from]] a noun (e.g. ''wasi'''manta''''' "from the house"). It is also used for a number of other relational meanings such as "about", "instead of", or "made of" (e.g. ''firu'''manta'''m'' "made of iron"; ''wasi'''manta''' riman'' "he speaks about the house").
*'''''-wan''''' marks accompaniment (as in ''ñuqa'''wan'''mi rin'' "he goes with me"), or indicates the means by which an action is performed (as in ''lampa'''wan''' llamkachkan'', "he is working with the hoe").
*'''''-paq''''' indicates the [[benefactive case|beneficiary of an action]], as in ''amikum'''paq'''mi rimapunqa'', "he'll speak on behalf of his friend"). When attached to a verbal, it means "about to", as in ''mikuy'''paq''' kachkan'', "he is about to eat".
*'''''-rayku''''' indicates causality (e.g. ''ñuqa'''rayku''''' "because of me"; ''munasqay'''rayku''''', "because I want to").
*'''''-kama''''' marks motion up to but not farther than the object (or, in the case of a verbal, passage of time until the affixed verbal), as in ''wasi'''kama''''' "up to the house".
*'''''-pura''''' indicates the location of an object among others of its kind (e.g. ''kikinchik'''pura''' qunakuranchik papakunta'', "we exchanged potatoes amongst ourselves").
*'''''-nka''''' implies equal distribution among members in a group (e.g. ''iskay'''ninka*''' quwanchik'', "he gives us two each"). This suffix appears as ''-ninka'' following a consonant
*'''''-kuna''''' pluralizes the noun to which it is attached (e.g. ''wasikuna'' "the houses"). It can be used in conjunction with other suffixes and precedes all other suffixes except the personal markers, as in ''wasikichik'''kuna'''man'' "to your (pl.) houses". This suffix is not obligatory and can be omitted if the meaning is clear without it, as in ''runa'' and ''runakuna'' which both mean people (''runa'' may also mean a single person).

===Verbal Morphology===

====Verbal Conjugations====
In contrast to the fairly simple [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] for nouns, Quechua verbal morphology is much more complex. Verbs are conjugated for [[grammatical person|person]] and number of both the subject and the object. Subject suffixes precede explicit object suffixes as in ''riku-y-ki-ku'' "We see you", in which the first person ''-y'' appears before the second person ''-ki'' (''ku'', in this case pluralizes the first person). However, even the subject markers are preceded by the suffixes ''-wa'' and ''-su'' which indirectly convey the direct object of the verb, as in ''riku-wa-n-ki'' "You see me". Explicit personal markers are preceded by one of the tentatively titled "[[grammatical aspect|aspect]]" morphemes. The simple present tense is marked by the suffix ''-n-'', apart from first-person subject and second-person object, where there is no suffix.

*Verbal Suffixes
**''-y'' refers to the speaker. It appears as ''-y'' following a vowel, ''-niy'' following a consonant, ''-i'' following the ''-n-'' marker of the simple present, and Zero following the future ending ''-sqa''.
**''-ki'' refers to the addressee, the person to whom one is speaking. It appears as ''-yki'' following /a/ or /u/, ''-niki'' following a consonant, and as ''-ki'' elsewhere
**''-n'' refers to a person other than the speaker or the addressee ([[Grammatical person|third person]]). It appears as ''-n'' following a vowel, and ''-nin'' following a consonant.
**''-chik'' refers to a group which includes the addressee. It appears as ''-nchik'' following a vowel, ''-ninchik'' following a consonant, and ''-chik'' elsewhere (as when it follows the ''-n-'' morpheme).
**''-ku'' refers to a group which excludes the addressee. It has no allomorphy.
**''-wa'' indicates that the speaker is the object of second or third person action
**''-su'' indicates that the addressee is the object of action by the third person (when followed by the second person ending).

Below is shown the verb ''rikuy'', "to see", fully conjugated in the simple present tense. The persons are shown accompanied by their coirresponding Quechua pronouns declined into the appropriate cases. Blocks which are left empty are either instances in which the object is the same as the subject, which requires the reflexive marker -''ku''-, as in ''riku-ku-y'' "I saw myself", or cases where such a statement is logically impossible, as in the intersection between a second person subject and a first person plural inclusive object, which would mean, approximately "You helped you and I".

==Syntax==
Ayacucho Quechua has a standard SOV word order, as in ''(pay) wasitam ruwachkan'' "he is building a house", but this can be inverted, since the syntactic relationship between nouns is made clear by the overt case markers. However, unlike in other casemarked languages (like [[Russian grammar#Syntax|Russian]] or [[Latin grammar#Word order|Latin]]), the inversion of the standard word order in Ayacucho Quechua does not serve to topicalize the word (or phrase) in question since this too is explicitly marked by the ''-qa'' [[topic–comment|discourse topic]] marker. Primarily then, inversions of word order serve to emphasize words as particularly relevant or salient (particularly verbs). Compare standard ''wasita qawan'' "he watches the house" with ''qawan wasita'' "he watches the house" (as opposed to feeling it or hearing about it) in which the act of watching is being specifically highlighted.

With respect to smaller constituents, the order is much more fixed. Modifiers, such as adjectives, preadjectivals, adverbials and attributive nouns all occur before the head which they modify (including possessive nouns marked with ''-pa''). Prepositions, when they occur, are also placed before their noun phrases.

'''Badagry Festival''' is an annual event held in [[Badagry]], a town in [[Lagos State]], Nigeria. It is organised by the African Renaissance Foundation (AREFO). The event reflects the significance of the ancient town during the slave trade era. It is a convergence of culture and display of African heritage. The organizer brings the indegine and culture-loving fans from around the world to celebrate the festival. One of the major highlights is the artistic display by masquerades, dancers, and fire eaters. It features football competition, the beating of [[Sato drum]], and Liberation Day Celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/09/african-magic-masquerades-end-badagry-festival/|title=African Magic, masquerades end Badagry festival|work=Vanguard Nigeria|author=Japhet Alakam|date=6 September 2015|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/08/2015-badagry-festival-calls-for-end-to-modern-slavery-in-africa/|title=2015 Badagry Festival: Calls for end to modern slavery in Africa|work=Vanguard Nigeria|author=Japhet Alakam|date=31 August 2015|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/08/badagry-festival-2015-uniting-the-diaspora-with-motherland/|title=Badagry Festival 2015… uniting the Diaspora with motherland|author=Anote Ajeluorou|work=The Guardian|date=25 August 2015|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2015/08/31/fanfare-at-badagry-festival/|title=Fanfare at Badagry Festival|author=PM News|date=31 August 2015|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/arts-entertainment/96974-annual-badagry-festival-begins.html|title=Annual Badagry Festival Begins|author=Premium Times|date=18 August 2012|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/lagos-black-heritage-festival-2015-beckons/207210/ |title=Lagos Black Heritage festival 2015 Beckons |work=Thisday News |author=Yinka Olatunbosun |accessdate=30 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518085904/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/lagos-black-heritage-festival-2015-beckons/207210/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyindependentnig.com/2015/07/badagry-glimpse-lagos-famous-tourist-site/|title=badagry glimpse lagos famous tourist site|author=Daily Independent|work=Kimberly Okonkwo|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/08/world-mayors-hail-badagry-festival/|title=World mayors hail Badagry festival|author=|work=Vanguard News|date=26 August 2012|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was initiated in 1999 to commemorate the end of the slave trade era and the significance of the ancient city during the period.

The 2015 Badagry festival was tagged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mybadagry.org/index.php/nawe/news/do-you-know/item/99-the-objectives-of-the-badagry-festival-by-sewedo-balogun|title=Objective of Badagry Festival by Sewedo Balogun|author=mybadagry.org|work=viyhon awhanse|
accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Toussaint L'Ouverture]]: The Catalyst for the struggle for liberation of the black". The event started on 20 August and ended on 30 August 2015. The festival creates a platform in Nigeria of those from the African diaspora to reunite with their motherland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mybadagry.org/index.php/badagry-the-place/festivals/item/33-badagry-festivals|title=Badagry Festival|work=my badagry|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held at Badagry Grammar School, Badagry, Lagos, Nigeria.

===City slave history===
The name Badagry derives from the means of livelihood of the indigenous people of the city, which include fishing, farming, salt making. However, others believe the city was named after [[Agbedeh]], a popular farmer, whose farm was named Agbadarigi, which was later pronounced Badagry by the Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyindependentnig.com/2015/07/badagry-glimpse-lagos-famous-tourist-site/|title=Badagry Glimpse Lagos Famous Tourist Site|author=Kinberly Okonjwo|work=Daily Independent|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 18th century Badagry served as a route for the Europeans when slaves were transported to the new destination of their buyers. It houses the cenotaph "Point of No Return", a place where the well was enchanted to ensure that slaves who drank from it forgot its destination. At the end of the 18th century, Badagry was one of the routes that benefited from the recurrent battle between [[Portnovo]] and [[Dahomey]] for the movement of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0198719035|title=West African Warfare in Bahia and Cuba|author=Manuel Barcia|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2014|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badagry was noted as the auction point for slaves captured during inter-village warfare.&lt;ref name=BSSC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=60SEBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=isbn:1496982010&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=9781496982018|title=Both Sides of the Same Coin|author=Damian C.

The first two-storey building was built in Marina, Badagry, in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1841623970|title=Nigeria|author=Lizzie Williams, Mark Shenley|date=2012|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, the site is facing massive environmental degradation due to lack of maintenance by the government, as well as the activities of commercial tree fellers. The government of [[Babatunde Fashola]] in an effort to reignite the glory of the city has started the construction of Badagry Expressway project, commissioning of Badagry Marina project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/157295-badagry-slave-route-faces-environmental-degradation.html|title=Badagry Slave Route faces environmental degeneration|author=Abiose Adelaja|work=Prime Time|date=24 March 2014|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0299054047|title=The African Slave Trade|author=Phillip Curtin|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|page=314|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BSSC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?isbn=1135765898|title=From Slave Trade to Empire|author=Olivier Pétré Grenouilleau|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Belarusian minority in Poland''' is composed of 47,000 people according to the Polish census of 2011.&lt;ref name="stat"&gt;''[http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/Przynaleznosc_narodowo-etniczna_w_2011_NSP.pdf Przynależność narodowo-etniczna ludności – wyniki spisu ludności i mieszkań 2011]''.

A small but unconfirmed Belarusian population remains in the [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship]] in western Poland. They may be assimilated into the Polish population, but Belarusian culture has not firmly disappeared in the whole of Poland since World War II.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
Poland first acquired a [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] (predominant ancestors of modern Belarusians) minority in the 16th century, when after the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 Poland gained control over some of eastern territories formerly belonging to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Poland retained control over that region until the [[partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century. In time, the Belarusian culture and nationality started to develop in that region, but also increasing number of people became [[Polonization|Polonized]]. Later influences, particularly [[Lithuanization]] and [[Russification]], further contributed to the blurry ethnic border and resulted in a region with many territories with significant minority of one culture or another.

===1918–1939===

[[File:BiałoruskiIIRP.PNG|thumb|Belarusian minority in the Second Polish Republic]]

In 1921, at the end of the [[Polish–Soviet War]], Belarusian territories were divided between [[Second Polish Republic]] and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] under the terms of the [[Peace of Riga]]. Thus the newly reborn Poland gained a disputed territory, known as [[Kresy]] or [[West Belarus]], inhabited by both Belarusians and Poles. According to the [[Polish census of 1921]], there were around 1 million Belarusians in the country. According to Soviet sources, there were 3 million Belarusians in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=AP2Hh3LVGaUC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;dq=1931+Poland+belorussians#PPA250,M1 ''Purism and Language: A Study in Modern Ukrainian and Belorussian Nationalism '', [[Indiana University]], [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians estimate the number of Belarusians in Poland at that time to be from 1.7 million&lt;ref&gt;Żarnowski, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; up to 2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Mironowicz, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Belarusians formed 3.1% of the populations of the Second Polish Republic, mostly inhabiting the [[Administrative division of Second Polish Republic|east-central voivodeships]], particularly the [[Nowogródek Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Nowogródek Voivodeship]].&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stosunki" /&gt; Belarusians consisted the majority of population of [[Polesie Voivodship]], however most of them didn't declare themselves as Belarusians, but at [[Tutejszy|Tutejsi ("Locals")]].

[[Osadnik|Several thousand Poles were settled]] in the area pursuant to the legislation of December 20, 1920.&lt;ref name="Glos"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klara Rogalska |title=Oni byli pierwsi (They were the first) |journal=[[Głos znad Niemna]] |year=18 February 2005 |volume=7 |issue=664 |pages=– |url=http://www.glos.wschod.org/664/historia.shtml |language=pl |access-date=2007-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012174514/http://www.glos.wschod.org/664/historia.shtml |archive-date=2007-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Polish legislative election, 1922|elections of November 1922]], a Belarusian party (in the ''[[Blok Mniejszości Narodowych]]'' coalition) obtained 14 seats in the [[Sejm|Polish parliament]] (11 of them in the lower chamber, [[Sejm]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mironowicz, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1923, [[Prime Minister of Poland]] [[Władysław Sikorski]] ordered a report on the situation of the Belarusian minority in Poland. That summer, a new regulation was passed allowing for the [[Belarusian language]] to be used officially both in courts and in schools. Obligatory teaching of the Belarusian language was introduced in all Polish [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]] in areas inhabited by Belarusians in 1927.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In the 1921–1926 period Poland did not have a consistent policy towards its ethnic minorities. Belarusian schools, not being subsidized by the Polish government, were facing severe financial problems already by 1921.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} After an early period of liberalization, tensions between increasingly nationalistic Polish government and various increasingly separatist ethnic minorities started to grow, and the Belarusian minority was no exception.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stosunki" /&gt; A Belarusian organization, the ''[[Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union]]'', was banned in 1927, and opposition to Polish government was met with state repressions.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stosunki" /&gt; Nonetheless compared to the (larger) [[Ukrainian minority in Poland|Ukrainian minority]], Belarusians were much less politically aware and active, and thus suffered fewer repressions than the Ukrainians.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stosunki" /&gt;

Increasingly, Belarusians in Poland faced extensive [[Polonization]]. After the [[Polish legislative election, 1930|1930 elections in Poland]], Belarusian representation in the Polish parliament was reduced and in the early 1930s the Polish government started to introduce policies intended to Polonize minorities.

In 1935, after the death of [[Józef Piłsudski]], a new wave of repressions was released upon the minorities, with many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches and Belarusian schools being closed.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stosunki" /&gt; In 1938 about 100 Orthodox churches were destroyed or converted to [[Roman Catholic]] ones in the eastern parts of Poland, the majority of them in ethnically Ukrainian territories.&lt;ref&gt;Mironowicz, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the [[Belarusian language]] was discouraged.  Not a single Belarusian school survived until the spring of 1939, and only 44 schools teaching the Belarusian language still existed in Poland at the beginning of [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Belarusian leadership was sent to [[Bereza Kartuska prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivan S. Lubachko. ''Belorussia under Soviet Rule, 1917–1957'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1972), 137&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, Belarusian political leaders reported to the League of Nations of tens of thousands being flogged by police, and subject to torture in interrogations.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan S. Lubachko. ''Belorussia under Soviet Rule, 1917–1957'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1972), 136–137&lt;/ref&gt; According to Belarusian accounts, sixty to seventy peasants were hanged daily during anti-guerrilla campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Vakar. ''Belorussia: The Making of a Nation'' (Cambridge: Harvard University, 1956), 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and pursuant [[invasion of Poland (1939)|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939]], portrayed by Soviet propaganda as 'liberation of Western Belarus and Western Ukraine', some Belarusians welcomed unification with [[Belorussian SSR]], although attitudes of many changed after experiencing the [[Soviet terror]].&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stosunki" /&gt; Nonetheless from 1939, with the exception of a brief period of Nazi occupation, almost all Belarusians previously living in Poland would live in the [[Belorussian SSR]].&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''[[God's Playground]]'' (Polish edition), second tome, p.512-513&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stosunki"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.bialorus.pl/index.php?secId=49&amp;docId=60&amp;&amp;Rozdzial=historia Stosunki polsko-białoruskie pod okupacją sowiecką (1939–1941)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623073822/http://www.bialorus.pl/index.php?secId=49&amp;docId=60&amp;&amp;Rozdzial=historia |date=2008-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initially planned to move the capital of the Byelorussian SSR to [[Vilnius]]. However, the same year [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered that the city and surrounding region be transferred to [[Lithuania]], which some months later was also invaded by Soviet Union and became a new Soviet Republic – [[Lithuanian SSR]]. Minsk therefore was proclaimed the capital of the enlarged [[Byelorussian SSR]]. The borders of the BSSR were again altered somewhat after the war (notably the largely Polish area around the city of [[Białystok]] was returned to Poland) but in general they coincide with the borders of the modern [[Republic of Belarus]].

After entering the Soviet Union, the people of Western Belarus, especially those who favored democracy and Belarusian independence, immediately faced violent repression from the [[NKVD]], which may explain incidents of local collaboration with Germans during the Nazi occupation of Belarus. Refugees from Western Belarus were arrested by Soviet authorities and frequently executed, [[Kurapaty]] graves contain many products from Poland – cloths, shoes. The most prominent victim of NKVD was the activist and linguist [[Branislaw Tarashkyevich]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The Belarusian minority has been active in political life in Poland since 1989.
In the 2006 elections to the Podlasie Sejmik, the Białoruski Komitet Wyborczy (Belarusian Electoral Committee) received 7,914 votes (2.05%), however this was not enough to receive any seats in the Council. The most votes from this list were for [[Jan Czykwin]] (2,405), Eugeniusz Wappa (1,669) and Eugeniusz Mironowicz (1,119).

When the local elections were repeated in the region on 20 May 2007, the Belarusians again submitted their own electoral committee, which for the first time had several Lithuanians running on the list, in their region of [[Sejny]] and [[Puńsk]].

There is an unknown number of Belarusians in northwest Poland, but some Polish Belarusians were relocated there by the Soviet invasion of Germany in April 1945 and the captured lands of formerly German [[Pomerania]] was annexed by Poland.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

[[File:Hans Memling - Allegory with a Virgin - WGA14896.jpg|thumb|right|[[Allegory]] of chastity by [[Hans Memling]]]]

'''Chastity''' is one of the [[seven virtues|seven virtues]] and it is defined as refraining from deviant [[Human sexual activity|sexual conduct]]. Chastity is usually defined within the [[morality|moral]] standards and guidelines of a culture, civilization or [[religion]]. The term is closely associated (and can be used interchangeably) with [[sexual abstinence]], especially in the context of [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chastity |title=Chastity &amp;#124; Define Chastity at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/chastity |title=Chastity &amp;#124; Define Chastity at Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The words "chaste" and "chastity" stem from the [[Latin]] adjective ''castus'' ("pure"). The words entered the English language around the middle of the 13th century. At that time, they meant slightly different things. "Chaste" meant "virtuous or pure from unlawful sexual intercourse" (referring to [[extramarital sex]]),&lt;ref name=etymonlineChaste&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chaste|title=chaste - Origin and meaning of chaste by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=podDictEtym&gt;{{cite web|url=http://podictionary.com/?p=605|title=podictionary - for word lovers - daily stories, trivia &amp; dictionary etymology|author=|date=|website=podictionary.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
while "chastity" meant "virginity".&lt;ref name="podDictEtym" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=chastity|title=chastity - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the late 16th century did the two words come to have the same basic meaning as a related adjective and noun.&lt;ref name="etymonlineChaste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="podDictEtym" /&gt;

==In Abrahamic religions ==
For many Muslims and Christians, acts of sexual nature are [[fornication|restricted to marriage]]. For unmarried persons, chastity is identified with [[sexual abstinence]]. Sexual acts outside or apart from marriage, such as [[adultery]], [[fornication]], and [[prostitution]], are considered [[sin]]ful.

===Christianity===
{{Redirect|Vow of chastity|vows of Catholic Religious|Evangelical counsels|vows of chastity in other Christian Churches|Religious vows}}

In many [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions, chastity is synonymous with sexual purity. Chastity means not having any sexual relations before marriage. It also means fidelity to husband or wife during marriage. In [[Catholicism|Catholic]] morality, chastity is placed opposite the [[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]] of [[lust]], and is classified as one of [[seven virtues]]. The moderation of sexual desires is required to be virtuous. Reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.

In [[marriage]], the spouses commit to a lifelong relationship that excludes sexual intimacy with other persons. After marriage, a third form of chastity, often called "vidual chastity", is expected of a woman while she is in mourning for her late husband. For example, Anglican Bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]] defined 5 rules in ''Holy Living'' (1650), including abstaining from marrying "so long as she is with child by her former husband" and "within the year of mourning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Holy Living |chapter = Chapter II, Section III, Of Chastity | author = [[Jeremy Taylor]] | year = 1650 | url = http://www.anglicanlibrary.org/taylor/holyliving/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular ethical system may not prescribe each of these. For example, Roman Catholics view sex within marriage as chaste, but prohibit the use of artificial contraception as an offense against chastity, seeing contraception as unnatural, contrary to God's will and design of human sexuality. Many [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] communities allow for artificial contraception, seeing the restriction of family size by artificial contraception as possibly not contrary to God's will. A stricter view is held by the [[Shakers]], who prohibit marriage (and [[sexual intercourse]] under any circumstances) as a violation of chastity. The [[Catholic Church]] has set up various rules regarding [[clerical celibacy]], while most Protestant communities allow clergy to marry.

Celibacy is required of [[Christian monasticism|monastic]]s—monks, nuns and friars—even in a rare system of [[double cloister]]s, in which husbands could enter the (men's) monastery while their wives entered a (women's) sister monastery. Required celibacy among the clergy is a relatively recent practice: it became Church policy at the [[Second Lateran Council]] in 1139. It was not uniformly enforced among the clergy until 200 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch, 'Reformation', Penguin Books, 2003, pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Catholic priests are permitted to marry, provided they do so before ordination and outside monastic life.

''Vows of chastity'' can also be taken by laypersons, either as part of an organised religious life (such as Roman Catholic [[Beguines and Beghards]] in the past) or on an individual basis: as a voluntary act of devotion, or as part of an ascetic lifestyle (often devoted to [[contemplation]]), or both. Some protestant religious communities, such as the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]], take vows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bruderhof.com/en/our-faith/foundations/church-order/our-vows|title=Our Vows|website=Bruderhof|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; of chastity as part of the church membership process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voluntary aspect has led it to being included among the main [[counsels of perfection]].

Chastity is a central and pivotal concept in Roman Catholic [[Christian theological praxis|praxis]]. Chastity's importance in traditional Roman Catholic teaching stems from the fact that it is regarded as essential in maintaining and cultivating the unity of body with spirit and thus the integrity of the human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=I. "Male and Female He Created Them . . ." |title=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] |chapter-url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P84.HTM |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2332}} It is also regarded as fundamental to the practise of the Catholic life because it involves an ''apprenticeship in self-mastery''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=II. The Vocation to Chastity |title=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] |chapter-url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P85.HTM |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2339}} By attaining mastery over one's passions, reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS, not evangelical church), chastity is very important, quoting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Physical intimacy between husband and wife is a beautiful and sacred part of God's plan for His children. It is an expression of love within marriage and allows husband and wife to participate in the creation of life. God has commanded that this sacred power be expressed only between a man and a woman who are legally married. The law of chastity applies to both men and women. It includes strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one's spouse after marriage.

"The law of chastity requires that sexual relations be reserved for marriage between a man and a woman.

"In addition to reserving sexual intimacy for marriage, we obey the law of chastity by controlling our thoughts, words, and actions. Jesus Christ taught,"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matthew 5:27–28)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/chastity/what-is-the-law-of-chastity?lang=eng|title=What Is the Law of Chastity?|author=|date=|website=lds.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

LDS teaching also includes that sexual expression within marriage is an important dimension of spousal bonding apart from, but not necessarily avoiding its procreative result.

=== Islam ===
Chastity is mandatory in Islam. Sex outside legitimacy is prohibited, for both men and women whether married or unmarried.

The most famous personal example of chastity in the Quran is Virgin Mary (Mariam) :

"And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Gabriel], and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds." (21 :91)

'''"'''And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.She said, "Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah ."He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy."She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?"'''"''' (19:17-20)

Extramarital sex is forbidden and the Quran says:

"And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way." (17:32)

"And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.Multiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated -Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful." (25:68-70)

The injunctions and forbiddings in Islam apply equally to men and women. The legal punishment for adultery is equal for men and women.  Social hypocrisy in many societies over history had led to a double standard when considering sin committed by men versus sin committed by women. Society tended to be more lenient and permissive towards men forgiving men for sins not forgivable when women do them. At the root of the contemporary wave of free sex for both sexes was apparently to establish equality and remove discrimination between man and woman. Instead of calling for equal cleanliness the call was for equal dirt. Not so in Islam. and in a list of commendable deeds the Quran says:

"Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward." (33:35)

Because the sex desire is usually attained before a man is financially capable of marriage, the love to God and mindfulness of Him should be sufficient motive for chastity:

"But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allah enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] from among whom your right hands possess - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful." (24:33) The prophet's prescription to the youth was:

Those of you who own the means should marry for this should keep their eyes uncraving and their chastity secure. Those who don't, may practise fasting for it curbs desire. " (Ibn Massoud)

Chastity is an attitude and a way of life. In Islam it is both a personal and a social value. A Muslim society should not condone relations entailing or conducive to sexual license. Social patterns and practices bent on flaring up the sexual desire are frowned upon by Islam be the means permissive ideologies, pruritic art or neglect of moral upbringing.  Personal freedoms should never be taught as the freedom to challenge God's injunctions or trespass over the limits He drew.

===Bahá'í Faith===
Chastity is highly prized in the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Similar to other Abrahamic religions, [[Bahá'í teachings]] call for the restriction of sexual activity to that between a wife and husband in [[Bahá'í marriage]], and discourage members from using pornography or engaging in sexually explicit recreational activities. The concept of chastity is extended to include avoidance of alcohol and mind-altering drugs, profanity, and gaudy or immoderate attire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Compilation of Compilations (Volume 1)|last=Research Department|first=Universal House of Justice|publisher=Baha'i Publications Australia|year=1991|isbn=|location=Australia|pages=|chapter=A Chaste and Holy Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Eastern religions ==

===Hinduism===
[[Hinduism]]'s view on premarital sex is rooted in its concept of [[Ashrama (stage)]] or the stages of life. The first of these stages, known as ''[[Brahmacharya]],'' roughly translates as chastity. Celibacy and chastity are considered the appropriate behavior for both [[male]] and [[female]] [[student]]s during this stage, which precedes the stage of the married householder ([[Grihastha]]). [[Sanyasa|Sanyasis]] and Hindu monks or [[Sadhu]]s are also celibate as part of their [[asceticism|ascetic]] discipline.

===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]], premarital or extra-marital sex is strictly forbidden. However, it is encouraged to marry and live as a family unit to provide and nurture children for the perpetual benefit of creation (as opposed to sannyasa or living as a monk, which was, and remains, a common spiritual practice in India). A Sikh is encouraged not to live as a recluse, beggar, monk, nun, celibate, or in any similar vein.

=== Jainism ===
Celibacy is a must for all [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks and nuns]]. Chastity (Bhramacharya) is one of the five major vows of [[Jainism]]. The general Jain code of [[ethics]] requires that one do no harm to any living being in thought, action, or word. Adultery is clearly a violation of a moral agreement with one's spouse, and therefore forbidden, and fornication too is seen as a violation of the state of chastity.

===Buddhism===
The teachings of [[Buddhism]] include the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], comprising a division called [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right action|right action]]. Under the [[Five Precepts]] ethical code, [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā]] lay followers should abstain from sexual misconduct, while [[Bhikkhu]] and [[Bhikkhuni]] monastics should practice strict chastity.

=== Daoism ===
The [[Five Precepts (Taoism)|Five Precepts]]  of the [[Daoist]] religion include No Sexual Misconduct, which is interpreted as prohibiting extramarital sex for lay practitioners and marriage or sexual intercourse for monks and nuns.

The '''Crimean Karaites''' or '''Krymkaraylar''' (Crimean [[Karaim language|Karaim]]: Кърымкъарайлар ''Qrımqaraylar'' sg. къарай – ''qaray''; [[Trakai]] [[Karaim language|Karaim]]: sg. karaj, pl. karajlar; {{lang-he-n|קראי מזרח אירופה}}; {{lang-tr|Karaylar}}), also known as ''Karaims'' and ''Qarays'', are an ethnic group derived from [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] adherents of [[Karaite Judaism]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], especially in the territory of the former [[Russian Empire]]. "Karaim" is a Russian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, and Polish name for the community.

== Origins ==

[[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] (in the [[Crimean Tatar language]], ''Qaraylar'') have lived in [[Crimea]] for centuries. Their origin is a matter of great controversy. Some regard them as descendants of Karaite Jews who settled in Crimea and adopted a form of the [[Kypchak]] tongue (see [[Karaim language]]). Others view them as descendants of [[Khazar]] or [[Cumans|Cuman]], [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] converts to Karaite Judaism. Today many Crimean Karaites deny ethnic Semitic origins and identify as descendants of the Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;Blady 113–130.&lt;/ref&gt; Some specialists in Khazar history question the Khazar theory of Karaim origins,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brook 2006 p. 110–111, 231.&lt;/ref&gt; noting the following:
* the Karaim language belongs to the [[Kipchak language|Kipchak]] [[linguistic]] group, and the Khazar language belongs to the [[Oghur languages|Bulgar]] group; there is no close relationship between these two Turkic languages;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Erdal|Erdal, Marcel]] (1999). "The Khazar Language". In: Golden et al., 1999:75–107&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the [[Khazar Correspondence]], Khazar Judaism was, most likely, [[Rabbinic Judaism|Talmudic]].&lt;ref&gt;"...After the days of Bulan there arose one of his descendants, a king Obadiah by name, who reorganized the kingdom and established the Jewish religion properly and correctly. He built synagogues and yeshiva/yeshivot, brought in Jewish scholars, and rewarded them with gold and silver. … They explained to him the Bible, Mishnah, Talmud and the order of divine services. The King was a man who revered and loved the Torah. He was one of the true servants of God. May the Divine Spirit give him rest!…" [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Khazar_Correspondence Khazar Correspondence text]&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of [[Karaite Judaism]] ranks only the [[Tanakh]] as a holy book and does not recognize the [[Talmud]];
* Khazars disappeared in the 11th century. But, the first written mention of the Crimean Karaites was in the 14th century;&lt;ref&gt;A. Harkavy, ''Altjudische Denkmaler aus der Krim, mitgetheilt von Abraham Firkowitsch, SPb.,'' 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19th century Crimea, Karaites began to distinguish themselves from other Jewish groups, sending envoys to the czars to plead for exemptions from harsh anti-Jewish legislation. These entreaties were successful, in large part due to the czars’ wariness of the Talmud, and in 1863 Karaites were granted the same rights as their Christian and Tatar neighbors. Exempted from the Pale of Settlement, later they were considered non Jews by Nazis. This left the community untouched by [[Holocaust]], unlike other Turkic-speaking Jews, like the [[Krymchak]] Jews that were almost wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/crimea-karaites-welcome-russia-1.5341282&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Karaim resist being identified as Jews, emphasizing their Turkic heritage and claiming they are Turkic practitioners of a "Mosaic religion" separate and distinct from Judaism. Miller says that Crimean Karaites did not start claiming a distinct identity apart from the Jewish people before the 19th century, and that such leaders as [[Avraham Firkovich]] and [[Sima Babovich]] encouraged this position to avoid the strong [[anti-Semitism]] of the period.&lt;ref name=MillerIntro&gt;Miller, Philip. ''Karaite Separatism in 19th Century Russia'', pp xv-xvi, 3, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of the [[Golden Horde]] onward, Karaites were present in many towns and villages throughout Crimea and around the [[Black Sea]]. During the period of the [[Crimean Khanate]], they had major communities in the towns of [[Çufut Qale]], [[Sudak]], [[Kefe]], and [[Bakhchisaray]].

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===
According to most opinions, the upper stratum of the Khazar society converted to Judaism in the 8th–9th centuries CE. The extent of this conversion and its scope is not known. With the collapse of the Khazar Khanate, a group of the Khazars who took part in a failed rebellion, joined the [[Magyars]] in the invasion of Hungary; they settled there at the end of the 9th century CE. An archeological relic of this Khazar settlement was discovered in [[Transylvania]] (today [[Romania]]) in the 20th century. Known as the [[Alsószentmihály inscription|Alsószentmihály Rovas inscription]], it was transcribed by the archaeologist-historian [[Gábor Vékony]].&lt;ref&gt;Vékony, Gábor (2004): ''A székely rovásírás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története'' [The Relics, Relations and the History of the Szekely Rovas Script]. Publisher: Nap Kiadó, Budapest. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the transcription, the two-row inscription means the following:&lt;ref&gt;Vékony, Gábor (1997): ''Szkíthiától Hungáriáig: válogatott tanulmányok''. [From Scythia to Hungary: Selected Studies] Szombathely: ''Életünk Szerk. Magyar Írók Szövetsége.'' Nyugat-magyarországi Csoport. Ser.: Életünk könyvek, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;
(first row) ''"His mansion is famous."'' &lt;br /&gt;
(second row) ''"Jüedi Kür Karaite."'' or ''"Jüedi Kür the Karaite."''

Scholars take this as evidence that at least a part of the Khazars were Karaites. (See [[Karaite Judaism#Karaite writings#Inscription in Khazarian Rovas script (10th century CE)|Inscription in Khazarian Rovas script]])

There they continued to speak their own language. But the Lithuanian dialect of the [[Karaim language]] differs significantly from the Crimean one.&lt;ref name="Schegoleva" /&gt; The Lithuanian Karaites settled primarily in [[Vilnius]] and [[Trakai]], as well as in [[Biržai]], [[Pasvalys]], [[Naujamiestis, Panevėžys|Naujamiestis]] and [[Upytė]] – smaller settlements throughout [[Lithuania proper]].

The Lithuanian Karaites also settled in lands of modern [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], which were part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Karaite communities emerged in [[Halicz]] and Kokizow (near [[Lwów]]) in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], as well as in [[Łuck]] and [[Derazhne]] in [[Volhynia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nosonovsky, M. |author2=Shabarovsky, V. |title=Караимская община XVI-XVIII веков в Деражном на Волыни|journal=Vestnik EUM |year=2005|volume=9|pages=31–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Шабаровський, В.

The [[Trakai]] Karaim refused to comply, citing differences in faith. Later all Jews, including Karaites,&lt;ref&gt;"He-Avar" ("Хе-Авар") Magazine, Petrograd, № 1, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; were submitted to [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinite]] "[[Council of Four Lands]]" (Vaad)&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Mann, "Karaica", ''Texts and Studies in Jewish History and Literature'', no. 11, Philadelphia, 1935; Jurgita Šiaučiūnaitė – Verbickienė, Žydai Lietuvos Didžiosios Kunigaikštystės visuomenėje: sambūvio aspektai, Vilnius, 2009; Idem, Ką rado Trakuose Žiliberas de Lanua, arba kas yra Trakų žydai, in ''Lietuvos istorijos studijos'', no. 7, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Council of the Land of Lithuania" taxation (1580–1646). The Yiddish-speaking Rabbinites considered the [[Karaim language|Turkic]]-speaking Karaites to be apostates, and kept them in a subordinate and depressed position. The Karaites resented this treatment. In 1646 the Karaites gained expulsion of the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinites]] from Trakai. Despite such tensions, in 1680 Rabbinite community leaders defended the Karaites of Shaty (near [[Trakai]]) against [[blood accusation]]. Representatives of both groups signed an agreement in 1714 to respect the mutual privileges and resolve disputes without involving the Gentile administration.

S. Pallas ''Bemerkungen auf einer Reise in die Südlichen Statthalterschaften des Russischen Reichs'' (1799–1801)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some famous Karaim scholars in Lithuania included [[Isaac b. Abraham of Troki]] (1543–1598), [[Joseph ben Mordecai Malinovski]], [[Zera ben Nathan of Trakai]], [[Salomon ben Aharon of Trakai]], [[Ezra ben Nissan]] (died in 1666) and [[Josiah ben Judah]] (died after 1658). Some of the Karaim became quite wealthy.

During the times of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the Karaim suffered severely during the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] of 1648 and the wars between Russia and Commonwealth [[History of Poland (1569–1795)|in the years 1654–1667]]. The many towns plundered and burnt included [[Derazhne]] and Trakai, where only 30 families were left in 1680. The destruction of the Karaite community in [[Derazhne]] in 1649 is described in a poem (both in Hebrew and [[Karaim language]]) by a leader of the congregation, [[Hazzan]] Joseph ben Yesh'uah Ha-Mashbir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nosonovsky, M. |title=The Karaite Community in Derażne and its Leader Hazzan Joseph ben Yeshu'ah |journal=Eastern European Karaites in the Last Generations|year=2011|pages=17–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic missionaries worked to convert the local Karaim to Christianity, but were largely unsuccessful.

=== Russian Empire ===
[[File:Trakai Kenesa.JPG|thumb|Karaim [[kenesa]] in [[Trakai]] (modern day Lithuania).]]
19th century leaders of the Karaim, such as [[Sima Babovich]] and [[Avraham Firkovich]], were driving forces behind a concerted effort to alter the status of the Karaite community in eyes of the [[Russia]]n legal system. Firkovich in particular was adamant in his attempts to connect the Karaim with the [[Khazars]], and has been accused of forging documents and inscriptions to back up his claims.&lt;ref&gt;Harkavy, Albert. "Altjudische Denkmaller aus der Krim mitgetheilt von Abraham Firkowitsch, 1839–1872." In ''Memoires de l’Academie Imperiale de St.-Peterboug'', VIIe Serie, 24, 1877; reprinted Wiesbaden, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the Tsarist government officially recognized the Karaim as being innocent of the death of [[Jesus]].So they were exempt from many of the harsh restrictions placed on other Jews. They were, in essence, placed on equal legal footing with [[Crimean Tatars]]. The related [[Krymchak]] community, which was of similar ethnolinguistic background but which practiced rabbinical Judaism, continued to suffer under Tsarist anti-Jewish laws.

[[Solomon Krym]] (1864–1936), a Crimean Karaite agronomist, was elected in 1906 to the First [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|Duma]] (1906–1907) as a ''Kadet'' ([[Constitutional Democratic Party|National Democratic Party]]). On November 16, 1918 he became the Prime Minister of a short-lived Crimean Russian liberal, anti-separatist and anti-Soviet government also supported by the German army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Alan W.|title=The Crimean Tatars|publisher=Hoover Press|year=1978|pages=264|isbn=978-0-8179-6662-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjwid7xcOPIC|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the incorporation of Crimea into the [[Russian Empire]] the main center of the Qarays is the city of [[Yevpatoria]]. Their status under Russian imperial rule bore beneficial fruits for the Karaites decades later.

=== During the Holocaust ===
In 1934, the heads of the Karaite community in Berlin asked the [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities to exempt Karaites from the anti-Semitic regulations based on their legal status as Russians in Russia. The [[Reich Agency for the Investigation of Families]] determined that, from the standpoint of German law, the Karaites were not to be considered Jews. The letter from the Reichsstelle für Sippenforschung &lt;small&gt;([[:de:Reichsstelle für Sippenforschung|de]])&lt;/small&gt; officially ruled:
{{quotation|The Karaite sect should not be considered a Jewish religious community within the meaning of paragraph 2, point 2 of the First Regulation to [[the Reich Citizenship Law]]. However, it cannot be established that Karaites in their entirety are of blood-related stock, for the racial categorization of an individual cannot be determined without … his personal ancestry and racial biological characteristics|&lt;ref&gt;YIVO archives, Berlin Collection, Occ E, 3, Box 100, letter dated January 5, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This ruling set the tone for how the Nazis dealt with the Karaite community in Eastern Europe. At the same time, the Nazis had serious reservations about the Karaites. [[SS]] Obergruppenfuhrer [[Gottlob Berger]] wrote on November 24, 1944:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Their Mosaic religion is unwelcome. However, on grounds of race, language and religious dogma... Discrimination against the Karaites is unacceptable, in consideration of their racial kinsmen [Berger was here referring to the Crimean Tatars]. However, so as not to infringe the unified anti-Jewish orientation of the nations led by Germany, it is suggested that this small group be given the opportunity of a separate existence (for example, as a closed construction or [[labor battalion]])..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite having exempt status, groups of Karaites were massacred in the early phases of the war. German soldiers who came across Karaites in Russia during the invasion of [[Operation Barbarossa]], unaware of their legal status under German law, attacked them; 200 were killed at [[Babi Yar]] alone. German allies such as [[Vichy France]] began to require the Karaites to register as Jews, but eventually granted them non-Jewish status after getting orders by [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Semi ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

When interrogated, [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[rabbis]] in Crimea told the Germans that Karaites were not Jews, in an effort to spare the Karaite community the fate of their [[Rabbanites|Rabbanite]] neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Blady 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Karaites risked their lives to hide Jews, and in some cases claimed that Jews were members of their community. The Nazis impressed many Karaites into [[labor battalion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Green ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vilnius]] and [[Trakai]], the Nazis forced Karaite [[Hakham]] [[Seraya Shapshal]] to produce a list of the members of the community. Though he did his best, not every Karaite was saved by Shapshal's list.&lt;!-- Unclear --&gt;

=== Post-War ===
After the Soviet recapture of Crimea from Nazi forces in 1944, the Soviet authorities counted 6,357 remaining Karaites. Karaites were not subject to mass deportation, unlike the Crimean Tatars, Greeks, Armenians and others the Soviet authorities alleged had collaborated during the Nazi German occupation. Some individual Karaites were deported.

Assimilation and emigration greatly reduced the ranks of the Karaite community. A few thousand Karaites remain in [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]] and [[Poland]]. Other minor communities exist in [[Israel]], [[Turkey]], the [[United States]], and [[Great Britain]].

In the 1990s, about 500 Crimean Karaites, mainly from Ukraine, emigrated to Israel under the [[Law of Return]].&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Kizilov.

== Geographic distribution ==
The name "Crimean Karaites" has often been considered as something of a misnomer, as many branches of this community found their way to locations throughout Europe.

As time went on, some of these communities spread throughout the region, including to Crimea. According to Karaite tradition, all the Eastern European Karaite communities were derived from those in the [[Crimea]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkiye.net/sota/karalit.html The Karaite Encyclopedia by Nathan Schur (Frankfurt, 1995)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228105622/http://www.turkiye.net/sota/karalit.html |date=2007-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but some modern historians doubt the Crimean origin of Lithuanian Karaites.&lt;ref name="Schegoleva"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eajc.org/page34/news24063.html|title=Karaites of Crimea: History and Present-Day Situation in Community|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahiezer, G. and Shapira, D. 2001.'Karaites in Lithuania and in Volhynia-Galicia until the Eighteenth Century' [Hebrew]. Peamin 89: 19–60&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this name, "Crimean Karaites" is used for the Turkic-speaking Karaites community supposed to have originated in Crimea, distinguishing it from the historically [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking Karaites of the [[Levant]], [[Anatolia]], and the [[Middle East]].For the purposes of this article, the terms "Crimean Karaites", "Karaim", and "Qarays" are used interchangeably, while "Karaites" alone refers to the general Karaite branch of [[Judaism]].

=== Lithuania ===
[[File:Karaite Kenesa Vilnius.jpg|thumb|upright|Kenesa in Vilnius]]
The local Karaim communities still exist in Lithuania (where they live mostly in [[Panevėžys]] and [[Trakai]] regions) and Poland. The 1979 census in the USSR showed 3,300 Karaim. ''Lithuanian Karaim Culture Community'' was founded in 1988.

According to the Lithuanian Karaim website the Statistics Department of Lithuania carried out an ethno-statistic research entitled "Karaim in Lithuania" in 1997. It was decided to question all adult Karaim and mixed families, where one of the members is a Karaim. During the survey, for the beginning of 1997, there were 257 people of Karaim nationality, 32 of whom were children under 16.

== Religion ==
Until the 20th century, [[Karaite Judaism]] was the only religion of the Karaim,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karaimskijkatichizis.estranky.cz/clanky/2.------------------------------------------------.html Катехизис, основы Караимского закона.

The Crimean Karaites' [[emancipation]] in the [[Russian Empire]] caused [[cultural assimilation]] followed by [[secularization]]. This process continued in the USSR when most of the [[kenesa]]s were closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/2003/vil2003_kizilov.htm|title=Karaites and Karaism: Recent Developments|author=Mikhail Kizilov|publisher=paper presented at the CESNUR 2003 Conference, Vilnius, Lithuania|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 [[secular]] Karaim [[philologist]] [[Seraya Shapshal]] was elected as [[Hacham]] of Polish and Lithuanian Karaim. Being a strong adopter of Russian orientalist V. Grigorjev's theory about the [[Khazars|Khazarian]] origin of the Crimean Karaites, Shapshal developed the Karaim's religion and historical dejudaization doctrine&lt;ref&gt;Roman Freund, ''Karaites and Dejudaization'' (Acta Universitas Stockholmiensis. 1991. – №30).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1930s, he began to create a theory describing the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]]-[[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin of the Karaim and the pagan roots of Karaite religious teaching (worship of sacred oaks, polytheism, led by the god [[Tengri]], the Sacrifice). Shapshal's doctrine is still a topic of critical research and public debate.

He made a number of other changes aimed at the Karaim's [[Turkification]] and at erasing the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jewish]] elements of their culture and language.&lt;ref&gt;М. Кизилов, ''Новые материалы к биографии Шапшала''// Материалы девятой международной конференции по иудаике (2002), с. 255—273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g compare the Trakai kenassa gate in 1932 [https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151445370009686&amp;set=o.426620280746666&amp;type=1&amp;theater] and today [[:File:Trakai Kenesa.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt; He issued an order canceling the teaching of [[Hebrew]] in Karaite schools and replaced the names of the Jewish holidays and months with Turkic equivalents ([[#Crimean Karaites Holidays names evolution in the 20th century|see the table below]]).

According to Shapshal, Crimean Karaites were pagans who adopted the law of [[Moses]], but continued to adhere to their ancient [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] beliefs. In addition, he claimed that the Karaites had revered [[Jesus]] and [[Mohammed]] as prophets for centuries. In the Post-Soviet period, Shapshal's theory was further developed in modern Karaylar publications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archipelag.ru/authors/malgin/?library=1169 A. Malgin. Евреи или тюрки.

== Genetics ==
Leon Kull and Kevin Alan Brook led the first scientific study of Crimean Karaites using genetic testing of both Y chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA and the results showed that Crimean Karaites are indeed partially of Middle Eastern origin and related to the descendants of rabbinic Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Alan Brook, Leon Kull, and Adam J. Levin, "The Genetic Signatures of East European Karaites," August 28, 2013, [http://www.khazaria.com/genetics/karaites.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Alan Brook, "The Genetics of Crimean Karaites," ''Karadeniz Araştırmaları'' №42 (Summer 2014): pp. 69–84, [http://www.karam.org.tr/DergiPdfDetay.aspx?ID=859 pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

=== Language ===
[[Karaim language|Karaim]] is a [[Kypchak]] [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language being closely related to [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], Armeno-Kipchak etc. Among the many different influences exerted on Karaim, those of Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian were the first to change the outlook of the Karaim lexicon. Later, due to considerable Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian influence, many Slavic and Baltic words entered the language of Polish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Russian Karaim. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] remained in use for liturgical purposes. Following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation of Crimea, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] was used for business and government purposes among Karaim living on the Crimean peninsula. Three different dialects developed: the Trakai dialect, used in [[Trakai]] and [[Vilnius]] ([[Lithuania]]), the Lutsk or Halych dialect spoken in [[Lutsk]] (until [[World War II]]), and [[Halych]], and the Crimean dialect. The last forms the Eastern group, while Trakai and Halych Karaim belong to the Western group. Currently only small minority of Karaim can speak the Karaim language (72 Crimean dialect speakers,&lt;ref name="ukrcensus_all_Ukraine" /&gt; 118 [[Trakai]] dialect speakers, and about 20 [[Halych]] dialect speakers).

=== Cuisine ===
[[File:Kibinai.jpg|thumb|''Kybyn'']]
The most famous Crimean Karaite food is ''Kybyn'' ({{lang-ru|Кибина}} pl. {{lang|ru|Кибины}}, [[Karaim language|Karaim:]] ''kybyn'' pl. ''kybynlar'', {{lang-lt|Kibinai}}). Kybynlar are half moon shaped pies of leavened dough with a stuffing of chopped beef or mutton, baked in [[dutch oven]] or baking sheet. Other meals common for Crimean Karaites and [[Lipka Tatars|Tatars]] are ''[[Chiburekki]]'', ''[[Pelmeni]]'', ''[[Shashlik|Shishlik]]'' (These are most often made from mutton).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caraimica.org/document/584 Virtual Karaim Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414124653/http://www.caraimica.org/document/584 |date=2013-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceremony dishes, cooked for religious holidays and weddings are:

This article is about the [[demographic]] features of the population of [[Iraq]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

The population is estimated to be {{UN_Population|Iraq}} as of {{UN_Population|Year}}, with most of the population being Arab (75-80%), followed by Kurds (15-20%) and others (5%). Iraqis are 0.6% - 3% Christian (down from 6% before 2003), 3% Yazidis, 2% Shabaks with numerous other faiths Shi'a Muslims make up 65% and form the majority and the rest belong to other religious minorities.

==Background==

{{See also|History of Iraq}}
Iraq is the region known outside the [[Islamic world]] as [[Mesopotamia]]. The population estimate in 1920 was 3 million. The ruins of [[Ur]], [[Babylon]] and other ancient cities are situated in Iraq, as is the legendary location of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Almost 75% of Iraq's population lives in the flat, alluvial plain stretching southeast from [[Tikrit]] to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]] carry about 70 million cubic meters of silt annually from this plain down to the delta. The water from these two great rivers, and the fertility of the soil in the alluvial plain and the delta, allowed early agriculture to sustain a stable population as far back as the [[7th millennium BC]].

Iraq's dominant ethnic group are the Mesopotamian Arabs, who account for more than three-quarters of the population.

According to the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]], citing a 1987 Iraqi government estimate,&lt;ref name="TWFIraq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html |title=Iraq|work=[[The World Factbook]]|date=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the population of Iraq is formed of 75-80% [[Arabs]] followed by 15% [[Kurds in Iraq|Kurds]].&lt;ref name="TWFIraq"/&gt; In addition, the estimate claims that other minorities form 5% of the country's  population, including the [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen/Turcoman]], [[Yezidis]], [[Shabak people|Shabak]], [[Kaka'i]], [[Bedouins]], [[Gypsies in Iraq|Roma]], [[Assyrians in Iraq|Assyrians]], [[Circassians in Iraq|Circassians]], Sabaean-Mandaean, and [[Ajam of Iraq|Persians]].&lt;ref name="TWFIraq"/&gt; However, the [[International Crisis Group]] points out that figures from the 1987 census, as well as the  1967, 1977, and 1997 censuses, "are all considered highly problematic, due to suspicions of regime manipulation" because Iraqi citizens were only allowed to indicate belonging to either the Arab or Kurdish ethnic groups;&lt;ref name=ICG&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2008|title= Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds: Conflict or Cooperation?|url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/images/Iraq_08_11_13_Turkey_and_Iraqi_Kurds_Conflict_or_Cooperation.pdf|publisher=[[International Crisis Group]]|page=16|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, this skewed the number of other ethnic minorities, such as Iraq's third largest ethnic group – the Turkmens/Turkomans.&lt;ref name=ICG/&gt;

A report published by the [[European Parliamentary Research Service]] suggests that in 2015 there was 24 million Arabs (15 million [[Shia]] and 9 million [[Sunni]]); 4 million Sunni [[Kurds]] (plus 500,000 Shia [[Faili Kurds]] and 200,000 [[Kaka'i]]); 3 million [[Iraqi Turkmen|Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman]]; 1 million [[Black Iraqis]]; 500,000 [[Christians]] (including [[Assyrians in Iraq|Assyrians]] and [[Armenians in Iraq|Armenians]]); 500,000 [[Yazidis]]; 250,000 [[Shabaks]]; 50,000 [[Gypsies in Iraq|Roma]]; 3,000 [[Mandaeism|Sabean-Mandaeans]]; 2,000 [[Circassians in Iraq|Circassians]]; 1,000 [[Baha’i]]; and a few dozen [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Jews]].&lt;ref name=EPRS&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2015|title=Minorities in Iraq Pushed to the brink of existence|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2015/548988/EPRS_BRI(2015)548988_REV1_EN.pdf|publisher=[[European Parliamentary Research Service]]|pages=3–4|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurds are the largest minority in Iraq. They are a [[Northwestern Iranian languages|Northwestern Iranic]] ethnic group who began migrating into various regions of Ancient Assyria in northern Iraq from Persian Azerbaijan in the period prior to the establishment of Abbasid rule in AD 750.&lt;ref&gt;Aboona, H. (2008). Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans: Intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Amherst, NY: Cambria Press. p. 92 - 95&lt;/ref&gt; According to most scholars, the Kurds formed a pastoral and tribal society.&lt;ref&gt;Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. . {{ISBN|978-1-60497-583-3}}. page 89-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Aboona, Kurds were "less disposed to adopt civilisation than the Persians and Turks that adopted Islam at its advance". In the region of Sulaimaniyah in 1820-1821, Kurds were still chiefly pastoral nomads, and four out of five were still living as such. Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. . {{ISBN|978-1-60497-583-3}}. page 89-105&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Kurds comprise between 15% and 20% of the country's population, and they have one of the highest birth rates of any group in Iraq (and the Middle East).&lt;ref&gt;On the Margins of Nations: Endangered Languages and Linguistic Rights.

==Languages==
{{See also|Languages of Iraq}}
Arabic and Kurdish are the two official languages of Iraq. Arabic is spoken or understood by arab population and some kurdish intellectuals, while Kurdish is spoken or understood by the Kurdish population in northern Iraq.

Kurdish, including several dialects, is the second largest language and has [[regional language]] status in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. Aramaic, in antiquity spoken throughout the whole country, is now only spoken by the Assyrian minority. The [[Iraqi Turkmen#language|Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman dialect]] of Turkish is spoken in pockets of northern Iraq (particuarly in the so-called [[Turkmeneli]] region) and numerous [[languages of the Caucasus]] are also spoken by minorities, notably the Chechen community.

97% of Iraqis follow [[Islam]]: 65% [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and 30% [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]].  1% of these describe themselves as "Just a Muslim".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CIA Factbook, Shias make up 65% of population, while Sunnis 30%. [[Christianity]] accounts for 5%, and the rest practice [[Mandaeism]], [[Yazidism]] and other religions.

While there has been voluntary relocation of many Christian families to northern Iraq, recent reporting indicates that the overall Christian population may have dropped by as much as 50 percent since the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]] in 2003, with many fleeing to Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon (2010 estimate).&lt;ref name="TWFIraq"/&gt; The percentage of Christians has fallen from 6% in 1991 or 1.5 million to about one third of this, due to massive exodus - [[Assyrian exodus from Iraq|two-thirds of Assyrian Christians]] have fled to other countries in the Middle East, Europe, United States and Canada.

Nearly all Iraqi Kurds are Sunni Muslims. A survey in Iraq concluded that "98% of Kurds in Iraq identified themselves as Sunnis and only 2% identified as Shias".&lt;ref name="pewresearch.org"&gt;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/20/who-are-the-iraqi-kurds/&lt;/ref&gt; The religious differences between Sunni [[Arabs]] and Sunni Kurds are small. While 98 percent of Shia Arabs belief that visiting the shrines of saints is acceptable, 71 percent of Sunni Arabs did and 59 percent of Sunni Kurds support this practice.&lt;ref name="pewresearch.org"/&gt; About 94 percent of the population in Iraqi Kurdistan is  Muslim &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-mansfield/religious-neutrality-iraqi-kurdistan_b_1587042.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2490">"'''Don't Panic — The Truth about Population'''" was a 2013 [[documentary]] about [[human overpopulation]] produced by Wingspan Productions and [[Open University|The Open University]] for the [[BBC]] as part of the ''[[This World (TV Series)|This World]]'' series and presented by Swedish statistician [[Hans Rosling]] of the [[Gapminder Foundation]].

The documentary combines a lecture by Rosling, showing [[Musion Eyeliner|Musion 3D]] [[infographics]] in front of him, with film sequences featuring exemplary stories in different regions in the world. One film section is about a [[family planning]] worker in [[Bangladesh]], where the [[life expectancy]] increased from less than 50 years in 1972 to over 70, while the number of children per woman declinded from more than seven to less than 2.5 in average, and is still falling. Rosling states that this number is representative worldwide, the reason why the total number of children globally is now at a stable level of 2 billions. According to him, the so-called [[population explosion]] has already been overcome, the human population will peak at eleven billions, and stabilize at this level by the end of the century.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[[The Daily Telegraph#Website|The Telegraph]], [[Tom Chivers]]: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10434043/Dont-Panic-the-Truth-About-Population-BBC-Two-review.html ''Don't Panic: the Truth About Population, BBC Two, review''], November 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]]: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2013/45/this-world-hans-rosling.html ''Don't Panic - The Truth About Population''].  Retrieved 12 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reviews described the documentary as "surprisingly upbeat"&lt;ref&gt;morethangreen.es: [http://www.morethangreen.es/en/overpopulated-bbc-documentary-by-hans-rosling/ ''Overpopulated – BBC Documentary by Hans Rosling'']&lt;/ref&gt; and as "wise and thoroughly informative programme, filled with surprising statistics, but mainly, it was an optimistic one".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

Filmmakers Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern capture Emmanuel Yeboah’s heart, spirit, and determination through the 2005 documentary ''Emmanuel’s Gift'', based on the true story of Emmanuel’s life solely dedicated to making change. Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, the documentary follows Emmanuel on his journey to change the political and societal norms wrapped around disabled people in his home country of Ghana. Being that he was born with a deformed right leg, Emmanuel witnessed firsthand his whole life how disabled people were treated and viewed in the eyes of society. Children born with disabilities in Ghana are often abandoned or, in more extreme cases, killed. If they do survive, they often become poor beggars on the street. He, on the other hand, grew up in a small home with his mother and family. His father abandoned his mother when he found out that his son had a deformed leg. Emmanuel shined shoes every day for $2, refusing to let the prejudices against disabled people get to his head. One day he put in a grant request to the Challenged Athletes Foundation based in California all the way over in the United States. His request was not one for money, but rather for a bike that he would later receive to travel nearly 380 miles across the entire country of Ghana on to show those that did not support equal rights that disabled people can accomplish above and beyond what society tells them they can.
Word spread fast about Emmanuel’s long journey on the bike given to him by the foundation. The Challenged Athletes Foundation, whom gave Emmanuel the bicycle, reached out and asked him to come to America to do their triathlon. Being the ultimate go getter, Emmanuel went along and was even given a prosthetic leg after due time. Being as selfless as he is, Emmanuel used his newly found fame to better the 2 million disabled people of Ghana. He was awarded the CAF Most Inspirational Athlete of the Year Award and Nike’s Casey Martin award in America. Along with these awards he was also gifted money, and he used it all to give the people of Ghana free wheelchairs, and started the Emmanuel Education Fund. Hearing about his son’s fame, Emmanuel’s father returned to him to make amends. Emmanuel clarifies in the documentary that he doesn’t buy the excuses his father stresses, but gifts his father with his forgiveness anyway. The documentary wraps up by showing many promising changes Emmanuel has made to Ghana and plans to make in the future.

'''Emotional promiscuity''' has been addressed in both the [[Popular psychology|popular press]] as well as in [[scientific literature]]. 

In the popular press, there was a book published in 2007 entitled, ''Avoid the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity,'' written by Brienne Murk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murk|first=Brienne|title=Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity|year=2007|publisher=Regal Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her book, Murk argues that (a) guarding one's heart is required for staying pure, (b) emotions cannot be trusted, and (c) that young people must set physical and emotional boundaries.  Murk also attempts to discourage young people from having premarital sex and engaging in activities she deems impure. The book is written from a Christian perspective, and its assertions based on the author's religious interpretations.

In scientific literature, Jones (2011) examined the concept of ''Emotional Promiscuity'' as a [[Personality psychology|personality]]/[[Differential psychology|individual difference]] construct &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Daniel|title=Emotional Promiscuity: Consequences for health and well-being|url=https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/37893|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones defines emotional promiscuity as the predisposition to fall in love easily, fast, and often.  Such individuals tend to love the feeling of [[falling in love]], and want to be with many [[Romance (love)|romantic]] partners.

Emotional promiscuity can be assessed through [[Self-report study|self-report]] using the Emotional Promiscuity Scale (or EP Scale;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Daniel|title=The Emotional Promiscuity Scale|year=2011|publisher=Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures|location=New York, Routledge|isbn=0415801753|pages=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is distinct from both [[Promiscuity|sexual promiscuity]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Jeffrey|author2=Gangestad, Steve|title=Individual differences in sociosexuality: Evidence for convergent and discriminant validity.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=60|pages=870–883|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.6.870}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|anxious attachment]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hazan|first=C|author2=Shaver, Phillip|title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1987|volume=52|pages=511–524|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511|pmid=3572722}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, emotional promiscuity poses a health risk when combined with sexual promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Daniel|author2=Paulhus, Delroy|title=The role of emotional promiscuity in unprotected sex.  |journal=Psychology &amp; Health|year=2012|volume=27|pages=1021–1035|doi=10.1080/08870446.2011.647819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular individuals who fall in love frequently and easily, and who are also comfortable with [[casual sex]], have many [[Safe sex|unprotected sexual]] partners. The authors argue this finding results from premature [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] which eventuates into the faulty perception that protection is unnecessary.

'''Filipinos in the Netherlands''' comprise migrants from the [[Philippines]] to the [[Netherlands]] and their descendants living there.&lt;ref name="embassy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philembassy.nl/default.asp?iId=KHKDG|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF PHILIPPINE - NETHERLANDS RELATIONS|date=2008|publisher=The Philippine Embassy in The Hague|accessdate=2009-01-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215025932/http://philembassy.nl/default.asp?iId=KHKDG|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FFON"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffon.org/documents/residents.doc|title=Filipino residents in the Netherlands |last=Palpallatoc|first=Mercy|publisher=FFON|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dutch government statistics, 16,719 persons of first or second-generation Philippine background lived in the Netherlands in 2011.&lt;ref name="CBS2011"/&gt; Though Filipinos live throughout the country, [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]] are homes to the largest Filipino communities.&lt;ref name="FFON"/&gt;

==Migration history and motivations==
The first Filipina to marry and settle came in 1947 to work in a hospital.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFON"/&gt; In the 1960s, a larger number of Filipinos arrived to work in hospitals in [[Leiden]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], as well as a clothing factory in [[Achterhoek]].&lt;ref name="FFON"/&gt; Since then, most Filipinos went to the Netherlands as contract workers, higher-education students, or medical workers.&lt;ref name="FFON"/&gt; Partly because of the large number of Filipinos living in the Netherlands, in 2009 [[KLM]] increased the number of direct flights to [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] (in [[Manila]]) to seven per week, and seven per week amongst other Filipino airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aseanaffairs.com/page/philippines,_netherlands_boost_two-way_air_flights|title=Philippines, Netherlands boost two-way air flights|date=2008-07-14|publisher=ASEAN Affairs|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every day, roughly 300–500 Filipino seamen pass through Dutch ports.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt; One-third of the [[au pair]]s in the Netherlands (1,500) are Filipinas.&lt;ref name="country"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philsol.nl/of/country-profiles.htm|title=Filipino Migration to Europe: Country Profiles |date=1997-11-24|work=Philippine International Migration:Issues and Concerns of the Filipino Migrants in the Netherlands|publisher=CFMW|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about 500 Filipinos work on [[Oil platform|oil rig]]s in the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name="country"/&gt; More than 80 Filipino students attend Dutch universities pursuing Masters or Doctorate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sikatangpinoy.com/pinoy-scholar-in-holland-continues-to-inspire.html|title=Pinoy scholar in Holland continues to inspire|last=Galicia|first=Loui|date=2009-01-23|publisher=Sikat ang Pinoy|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community organisations==
The first Filipino organisation in the Netherlands, Philippine Nurses Association of the Academisch Ziekenhuis in Leiden, was created in 1965.&lt;ref name="MNNM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mnnetherlands.com/dir/_page/100214/|title=History of the Filipino Community in the Netherlands|last=Flores-Valenzuela|first=Orquidia |work=Munting Nayon News Magazine|year=1999|issue=125|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, other organisations such as the Dutch-Philippine Association and Dutch-Philippine Club were formed. In 1999 there were more than 20 such organisations in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="MNNM"/&gt;

There are two major Philippine publications in the Netherlands, the ''Philippine Digest'' and the ''Munting Nayon''.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;

Historically the heritage of the French people is mostly of [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] origin, descending from the ancient and medieval populations of [[Gauls]], [[Ligures]], [[Italic peoples|Latins]], [[Iberians]], and to a lesser extent, [[Germanic people]] such as [[Franks]],  [[Alamans]] and [[Norsemen]].&lt;ref name="Ligures, Ibères 2008, p. 261" /&gt; France has long been a patchwork of local customs and regional differences, and while most French people still speak the [[French language]] as their [[mother tongue]], languages like [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Auvergnat language|Auvergnat]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[French Flemish]], [[Lorraine Franconian]], [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] remain spoken in their respective regions. [[Varieties of arabic|Arabic]] is also widely spoken, arguably the largest minority language in France as of the 21st century (a spot previously held by [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To count or not to count|url=https://www.economist.com/node/13377324|accessdate=26 May 2018|work=The Economist|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern French society is a [[melting pot]].&lt;ref&gt;French historian Gérard Noiriel uses the phrase "creuset français" to express the idea, in his pioneering work ''Le Creuset français'' (1988). See {{cite book |title=The French melting pot: immigration, citizenship, and national identity |last=Noiriel |first=Gérard |year=1996 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press  |location=Minneapolis |isbn=0816624194}} ; translated from French by Geoffroy de Laforcade.&lt;/ref&gt; From the middle of the 19th century, it experienced a high rate of [[Immigration to France|inward migration]], mainly consisting of [[Arab-Berber]]s, [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan]] [[Africans]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and other peoples from [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and [[East Asia]], and the government, defining France as an inclusive nation with universal values, advocated [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] through which immigrants were expected to adhere to French values and cultural norms. Nowadays, while the government has let newcomers retain their distinctive cultures since the mid-1980s and requires from them a mere [[Social integration|integration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/french-government-revives-assimilation-policy|title=French Government Revives Assimilation Policy|date=1 October 2003|website=Migrationpolicy.org|accessdate=12 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130222428/http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/french-government-revives-assimilation-policy|archivedate=30 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; French citizens still equate their [[nationality]] with [[citizenship]] as does French law.&lt;ref name=Const58/&gt;

==Citizenship and legal residence==
To be French, according to the first article of the French [[French Constitution of 1958|Constitution]], is to be a citizen of France, regardless of one's origin, race, or religion (''sans distinction d'origine, de race ou de religion'').&lt;ref name=Const58&gt;"France shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic. It shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without distinction of origin, race or religion", [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp Constitution of 4 October 1958]&lt;/ref&gt; According to its principles, France has devoted itself to the destiny of a ''proposition nation'', a generic territory where people are bounded only by the [[French language]] and the assumed willingness to live together, as defined by [[Ernest Renan]]'s "''plébiscite de tous les jours''" ('everyday plebiscite') on the willingness to live together, in Renan's 1882 essay "[[Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]").

The debate concerning the integration of this view with the principles underlying the European Community remains open.&lt;ref&gt;One point of friction can be the status of minority languages. However, though almost extinct, such regional languages are preserved in France and one can learn them at school as a second language (''enseignement de langue regionale'').&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of foreigners&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica ''"in the 19th and especially in the 20th century, [France has become] the prime recipient of foreign immigration into Europe"'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-41116/France Encyclopædia Britannica Article: French ethnic groups].&lt;/ref&gt; have traditionally been permitted to live in France and succeeded in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephine Baker]], one of the most famous American residents in France, has said: ''the USA is my country but Paris is my home''.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the country has long valued its [[openness]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and the quality of services available.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the [[World Health Organization]] found that France provided the "best overall health care" in the world [http://www.who.int/whr/2000/media_centre/press_release/en/ World Health Organization Assesses the World's Health Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; Application for [[French citizenship]] is often interpreted as a renunciation of previous state [[allegiance]] unless a [[dual citizenship]] agreement exists between the two countries (for instance, this is the case with [[Switzerland]]: one can be both French and Swiss). The [[European treaties]] have formally permitted movement and European citizens enjoy formal rights to employment in the state sector (though not as trainees in reserved branches, e.g., as [[magistrates]]).

Seeing itself as an inclusive nation with universal values, France has always valued and strongly advocated [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]]. However, the success of such assimilation has recently been called into question. There is increasing dissatisfaction with, and within, growing [[Ethnic enclave|ethno-cultural enclaves]] (''[[communitarianism|communautarisme]]''). The [[2005 French riots]] in some troubled and impoverished suburbs (''les quartiers sensibles'') were an example of such tensions. However they should not be interpreted as [[ethnic conflict]]s (as appeared before in other countries like the USA and the UK) but as [[social conflict]]s born out of [[Economic inequality|socioeconomic problems]] endangering proper integration.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes LAGRANGES, ''Emeutes, renovation urbaine et alienation politique'', Observatoire sociologique du changement, Paris, 2007 [http://osc.sciences-po.fr/publication/nd_2007_05.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of France}}

French people are the descendants of [[Gauls]] and Romans, western European [[Celts|Celtic]] and Italic peoples, as well as [[Bretons]], [[Aquitani]]ans, [[Ligurians]], and [[Germanic people]] arriving at the beginning of the [[Frankish Empire]] such as the [[Franks]], the [[Visigoths]], the [[Suebi]], the [[Saxons]], the [[Allemanni]] and the [[Burgundians]], and later Germanic groups such as the [[Vikings]] (known as [[Normans]]), who settled in [[Normandy]] and to a lesser extent in [[Brittany]] in the 9th century.&lt;ref name="The normans"&gt;[http://www.jerseyheritagetrust.org/edu/resources/pdf/normans.pdf The normans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326114613/http://www.jerseyheritagetrust.org/edu/resources/pdf/normans.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }} Jersey heritage trust&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "France" etymologically derives from the word [[Francia]], the territory of the [[Franks]]. The Franks were a Germanic tribe that [[Migration Period|overran]] Roman Gaul at the end of the [[Roman Empire]].

===Celtic and Roman Gaul===
[[File:Map Gallia Tribes Towns.png|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Map of Gaul before complete Roman conquest (circa 58 [[Common Era|BCE]]) and its five main regions : [[Gallia Celtica|Celtica]], [[Gallia Belgica|Belgica]], [[Gallia Cisalpina|Cisalpina]], [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonensis]] and [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitania]].]]
{{Main article|Celts|Gaul|Gauls|Roman Empire}}

In the pre-Roman era, all of Gaul (an area of Western Europe that encompassed all of what is known today as France, Belgium, part of Germany and Switzerland, and Northern Italy) was inhabited by a variety of peoples who were known collectively as the [[List of peoples of Gaul|Gaulish tribes]]. Their ancestors were [[Celts]] who came from Central Europe in the 7th century [[Common Era|BCE]] (and even before, according to new research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Venceslas|last = Kruta|title= Les Celtes : Histoire et dictionnaire|language = French|date = 2000|publisher = Robert Laffont|isbn = 978-2221056905}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and dominated native peoples including the [[Ligures]], and [[Aquitanic]] people (among them, the [[Basques]]) in Aquitaine. Some, particularly in the northern and eastern areas, may have had Germanic admixture (the [[Belgae]]); many of these peoples had already spoken Celtic ([[Gaulish]]) by the time of the Roman conquest.

Gaul was militarily conquered in 58–51 BCE by the [[Roman legions]] under the command of General [[Julius Caesar]] (except the south-east which had already been conquered about one century earlier). Over the next six centuries, the two cultures intermingled, creating a hybridized [[Gallo-Roman culture]]. In the late Roman era, in addition to [[Coloniae|colonists from elsewhere in the Empire]] and Gaulish natives, Gallia also became home to some in-migrating populations of Germanic and Scythian origin, such as [[Alans]].

The [[Gaulish language]] is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable Romanization of the local material culture.&lt;ref name=Helix&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence Hélix| title=Histoire de la langue française|isbn=978-2-7298-6470-5|publisher=Ellipses Edition Marketing S.A.|page=7|quote=Le déclin du Gaulois et sa disparition ne s'expliquent pas seulement par des pratiques culturelles spécifiques: Lorsque les Romains conduits par César envahirent la Gaule, au 1er siecle avant J.-C., celle-ci romanisa de manière progressive et profonde.

The [[Vulgar Latin]] in the region of Gallia took on a distinctly local character, some of which is attested in graffiti&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;, which evolved into the [[Gallo-Romance]] dialects which include French and its closest relatives.

===Frankish Kingdom===
{{Main article|Franks|Frankish Kingdom}}
With the decline of the Roman Empire in Western Europe, a federation of Germanic peoples entered the picture: the [[Franks]], from which the word "French" derives. The Franks were Germanic pagans who began to settle in northern Gaul as ''[[laeti]]'', already during the Roman era. They continued to filter across the [[Rhine River]] from present-day [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] between the third to the 7th century. At the beginning, they served in the Roman army and reached high commands. Their language is still spoken as a kind of Dutch ([[French Flemish|Flemish]] - [[Low Frankish]]) in northern France ([[Westhoek (region)|Westhoek]]) and [[Franks#Language and literature|Frankish]] ([[Central Franconian]]) in German speaking [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]]. Another Germanic people immigrated massively to [[Alsace]]: the Alamans, which explains the [[Alemannic German]] spoken there. They were competitors of the Franks; that's why, in Renaissance times, it became the French word for "German": ''Allemand''.

By the early 6th century the Franks, led by the [[Merovingian]] king [[Clovis I]] and his sons, had consolidated their hold on much of modern-day France, the country to which they gave their name. The other major Germanic people to arrive in France (after the [[Burgundians]] and the [[Visigoths]]) were the [[Norsemen]] or [[Viking expansion#West Francia|Northmen]], (which was shortened to [[Norman people|Norman]] in France), [[Viking]] raiders from modern [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], who settled with Anglo-Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons from the [[Danelaw]] definitely in the northern region known today as [[Normandy]] in the 9th and 10th century, and which was given in fiefdom of the kingdom of France by king [[Charles the Simple|Charles III]]. The Vikings eventually intermarried with the local people, converting to [[Christianity]] in the process. It was the Normans who, two centuries later, would go on to [[Norman conquest|conquer]] England and [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Southern Italy]].

Eventually, though, the largely autonomous [[duchy of Normandy]] was incorporated back into the [[crown lands of France|royal domain]] (i. e. the territory under direct control of the French king) in the [[France in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]. In the crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], founded in 1099, at most 120 000 Franks (predominantly [[French language|French]]-speaking Western Christians) ruled over 350,000 Muslims, Jews, and native Eastern Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Z. Kedar, "The Subjected Muslims of the Frankish Levant", in ''The Crusades: The Essential Readings'', ed. [[Thomas F. Madden]], Blackwell, 2002, pg. 244. Originally published in ''Muslims Under Latin Rule, 1100–1300'', ed. James M. Powell, Princeton University Press, 1990. Kedar quotes his numbers from [[Joshua Prawer]], ''Histoire du royaume latin de Jérusalem'', tr. G. Nahon, Paris, 1969, vol. 1, pp. 498, 568-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the roughly 900 years after the [[Normans|Norman invasions]] France had a fairly settled population.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Unlike elsewhere in Europe, France experienced relatively low levels of emigration to the [[Americas]], with the exception of the [[Huguenots]], due to a lower birthrate than in the rest of Europe. However, significant emigration of mainly [[Roman Catholic]] French populations led to the settlement of the Province of [[Acadia]], [[Canada (New France)]] and [[Louisiana]], all (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the [[West Indies]], [[Mascarene]] islands and [[Africa]].

On 30 December 1687 a community of French [[Huguenots in South Africa|Huguenots]] settled in [[South Africa]]. Most of these originally settled in the [[Cape Colony]], but have since been quickly absorbed into the [[Afrikaner]] population. After Champlain's founding of Quebec City in 1608, it became the capital of [[New France]].

===French Republic===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by Eugène Delacroix]]
The [[French First Republic]] appeared following the 1789 [[French Revolution]]. It replaced the ancient kingdom of France, ruled by the [[divine right of kings]].

Hobsbawm highlighted the role of [[conscription]], invented by Napoleon, and of the 1880s public instruction laws, which allowed mixing of the various groups of France into a [[nationalist]] mold which created the French citizen and his consciousness of membership to a common nation, while the various regional [[languages of France]] were progressively eradicated.

The 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]], which led to the short-lived [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, was instrumental in bolstering [[patriotic]] feelings; until [[World War I]] (1914–1918), French politicians never completely lost sight of the disputed [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which played a major role in the definition of the French nation and therefore of the French people.

The [[Crémieux decrees|decrees of 24 October 1870]] by [[Adolphe Crémieux]] granted automatic and massive French citizenship to all [[Jewish people]] of Algeria.

===20th century===
Successive waves of immigrants during the 19th and 20th centuries were rapidly assimilated into French culture. France's population dynamics began to change in the middle of the 19th century, as France joined the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The pace of industrial growth attracted millions of European [[immigrants]] over the next century, with especially large numbers arriving from [[Poland]], [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uUsLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Transactions of the American Philosophical Society. III. French Government and the Refugees]''". American Philosophical Society, James E. Hassell (1991). p.22. {{ISBN|0-87169-817-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 1915 to 1950, many immigrants came from [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. Small but significant numbers of Frenchmen in the North and Northeast regions have relatives in [[Germany]] and [[Great Britain]].

Between 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 North African [[Jews]] from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco also immigrated to France due to the decline of the French empire and following the Six-Day War. Hence, by 1968, Jews of North African origin comprised the majority of the Jewish population of France. As these new immigrants were already culturally French they needed little time to adjust to French society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Esther Benbassa]], ''The Jews of France: A History from Antiquity to the Present'', Princeton University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

French law made it easy for thousands of [[settlers]] (''colons'' in French), national French from former colonies of North and East [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[Indochina]] to live in mainland France. It is estimated that 20,000 settlers were living in [[Saigon]] in 1945, and there were 68,430 European settlers living in [[Madagascar]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"''The educated African: a country-by-country survey of educational development in Africa''".

In the 1960s, a second wave of immigration came to France, which was needed for reconstruction purposes and for cheaper labour after the devastation brought on by [[World War II]]. French entrepreneurs went to [[Maghreb]] countries looking for cheap labour, thus encouraging work-immigration to France. Their settlement was officialized with [[Jacques Chirac]]'s family regrouping act of 1976 (''regroupement familial''). Since then, immigration has become more varied, although France stopped being a major immigration country compared to other European countries. The large impact of [[North African]] and [[Arab]] immigration is the greatest and has brought [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], socio-cultural and [[religious]] questions to a country seen as [[wiktionary:Homogenous|homogenous]]ly European, French and [[Christian]] for thousands of years.

Algerian and Moroccan immigrants have a higher propensity to exogamy than Asians or Portuguese but a much weaker labour market position. (...) Confirming the results from other analyses of immigrant assimilation in France, this study shows that North Africans seem to be characterized by a high degree of cultural integration (reflected in a relatively high propensity to exogamy, notably for Tunisians) that contrasts with a persistent disadvantage in the labour market.", [http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_ARTICLE=POPE_802_0239 Intermarriage and assimilation: disparities in levels of exogamy among immigrants in France], Mirna Safi, Volume 63 2008/2&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Emmanuel Todd]] the relatively high exogamy among French Algerians can be explained by the colonial link between France and Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emmanuel Todd]], ''Le destin des immigrés: assimilation et ségrégation dans les démocraties occidentales'', Paris, 1994, p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

A small French descent group also subsequently arrived from [[Latin America]] ([[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]) in the 1970s.

Most French people speak the [[French language]] as their [[mother tongue]], but certain languages like [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Auvergnat language|Auvergnat]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Basque language|Euskara]], [[French Flemish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] remain spoken in certain regions (see [[Language policy in France]]). There have also been periods of history when a majority of French people had other first languages (local languages such as [[Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[West Flemish]], [[Lorraine Franconian]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Picard language|Picard]] or Ch'timi and [[Arpitan]]). Today, many immigrants speak another tongue at home.

According to historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], "the French language has been essential to the concept of 'France'," although in 1789, 50 percent of the French people did not speak it at all, and only 12 to 13 percent spoke it fairly well; even in [[oïl languages]] zones, it was not usually used except in cities, and even there not always in the [[faubourgs|outlying districts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''Nations and Nationalism since 1780 : programme, myth, reality'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1990; {{ISBN|0-521-43961-2}}) chapter II "The popular protonationalism", pp.80-81 French edition ([[Gallimard]], 1992). According to Hobsbawm, the base source for this subject is [[Ferdinand Brunot]] (ed.), ''Histoire de la langue française'', Paris, 1927–1943, 13 volumes, in particular the tome IX. He also refers to [[Michel de Certeau]], Dominique Julia, Judith Revel, ''Une politique de la langue: la Révolution française et les patois: l'enquête de l'abbé Grégoire'', Paris, 1975. For the problem of the transformation of a minority official language into a mass national language during and after the [[French Revolution]], see Renée Balibar, ''L'Institution du français: essai sur le co-linguisme des Carolingiens à la République'', Paris, 1985 (also ''Le co-linguisme'', [[PUF]], [[Que sais-je?]], 1994, but out of print) ("The Institution of the French language: essay on colinguism from the [[Carolingian]] to the [[French Republic|Republic]]"). Finally, Hobsbawm refers to Renée Balibar and Dominique Laporte, ''Le Français national: politique et pratique de la langue nationale sous la Révolution'', Paris, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abroad===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|The [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] has two French mottos: [[Dieu et mon droit]] and [[Honi soit qui mal y pense]].]]

Abroad, the [[French language]] is spoken in many different countries – in particular the [[French colonial empires|former French colonies]]. Nevertheless, speaking French is distinct from being a French citizen. Thus, ''[[francophonie]]'', or the speaking of French, must not be confused with French citizenship or ethnicity. For example, French speakers in [[Switzerland]] are not "French citizens".

Native English-speaking Blacks on the island of [[Saint-Martin]] hold French nationality even though they do not speak French as a first language, while their neighbouring French-speaking Haitian immigrants (who also speak a French-creole) remain foreigners. Large numbers of people of French ancestry outside Europe speak other first languages, particularly English, throughout most of North America (except French Canada), Spanish or Portuguese in southern [[South America]], and [[Afrikaans]] in [[South Africa]].

The adjective "French" can be used to mean either "French citizen" or "French-speaker", and usage varies depending on the context, with the former being common in France. The latter meaning is often used in Canada, when discussing matters internal to Canada.

==Nationality, citizenship, ethnicity==
The modern ethnic French are the descendants of [[Romans]], [[Celts]], [[Iberians]], [[Ligures|Ligurians]] and [[Greeks]] in southern France,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Éric Gailledrat, ''Les Ibères de l'Èbre à l'Hérault (VIe-IVe s. avant J.-C.)'', Lattes, Sociétés de la Protohistoire et de l'Antiquité en France Méditerranéenne, Monographies d'Archéologie Méditerranéenne - 1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominique Garcia 1997, pp. 38-40"&gt;Dominique Garcia: ''Entre Ibères et Ligures.

À Narbonne, les traces d'une mosquée datant du VIIIe siècle sont le témoignage de l'ancienneté de ce passé. Lors de la célèbre, et en partie mythologique, bataille de Poitiers en 732, dont les historiens reconsidèrent aujourd'hui l'importance, Charles Martel aurait stoppé la progression des envahisseurs arabes. Des réfugiés musulmans qui fuyaient la Reconquista espagnole, et plus tard l'Inquisition, firent souche en Languedoc-Roussillon et dans le Pays basque français, ainsi que dans le Béarn", [[Justin Vaïsse]], ''Intégrer l'Islam'', Odile Jacob, 2007, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Vikings]] who mixed with the [[Normans]] and settled mostly in [[Normandy]] in the 9th century.&lt;ref name="The normans"/&gt;

According to [[Dominique Schnapper]], "The classical conception of the nation is that of an entity which, opposed to the ethnic group, affirms itself as an open community, the will to live together expressing itself by the acceptation of the rules of a unified public domain which transcends all particularisms".&lt;ref name="Schnapper"&gt;[[Dominique Schnapper]], "La conception de la nation", "Citoyenneté et société", ''Cahiers Francais'', n° 281, mai-juin 1997&lt;/ref&gt; This conception of the nation as being composed by a "will to live together," supported by [[What is a Nation?|the classic lecture]] of [[Ernest Renan]] in 1882, has been opposed by the French [[far-right]], in particular the [[nationalism|nationalist]] ''[[National Front (France)|Front National]]'' ("National Front" - FN) party which claims that there is such a thing as a "French ethnic group". The discourse of ethno-nationalist groups such as the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (FN), however, advances the concept of ''Français de souche'' or "indigenous" French.

The conventional conception of French history starts with Ancient Gaul, and French national identity often views the Gauls as national precursors, either as biological ancestors (hence the refrain ''nos ancêtres les Gaulois''), as emotional/spiritual ancestors, or both.&lt;ref name="WhatFrench?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is France?

However, despite its occasional nativist usage, the Gaulish identity has also been embraced by French of non-native origins as well: notably, [[Napoleon III]], whose family was ultimately of Corsican and Italian roots, identified France with Gaul and Vercingetorix,&lt;ref name="AncientAlesia"/&gt; and declared that "New France, ancient France, Gaul are one and the same moral person."&lt;ref name="VercingeVatel"/&gt;

It has been noted that the French view of having Gallic origins has evolved over history. Before the French Revolution, it divided social classes, with the peasants identifying with the native Gauls while the aristocracy identified with the Franks.&lt;ref name="VercingeVatel" /&gt; During the early nineteenth century,&lt;ref name="VercingeVatel"/&gt; intellectuals began using the identification with Gaul instead as a unifying force&lt;ref name="AncientAlesia"/&gt; to bridge divisions within French society with a common [[National myth|national origin myth]]. Myriam Krepps of the University of Nebraska-Omaha argues that the view of "a unified territory (one land since the beginning of civilization) and a unified people" which de-emphasized "all disparities and the succession of waves of invaders" was first imprinted on the masses by the unified history curriculum of French textbooks in the late 1870s.&lt;ref name="VercingeVatel"/&gt;

Since the beginning of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940), the state has not categorized people according to their alleged ethnic origins. Hence, in contrast to the [[United States Census]], French people are not asked to define their ethnic appartenance, whichever it may be. The usage of ethnic and racial categorization is avoided to prevent any case of discrimination; the same regulations apply to religious membership data that cannot be compiled under the French Census. This classic French republican non-[[essentialist]] conception of nationality is officialized by the [[French Constitution]], according to which "French" is a [[French nationality law|nationality]], and not a specific ethnicity.

===Genetics===
France has been influenced by the many different human migrations that wide-crossed Europe over time. Prehistoric and Neolithic population movements could have influenced the genetic diversity of this country. A study in 2009 analysed 555 French individuals from 7 different regions in mainland France and found the following [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA Haplogroups]]. The five main haplogroups are R1 (63.41%), E (11.41%) (traced mostly in the Paris area), I (8.88%), J (7.97%) and G (5.16%). [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]] (particularly R1b1b2) was found to be the most dominant Y chromosomal lineage in France, covering about 60% of the Y chromosomal lineages. The high frequency of this haplogroup is typical in all West European populations. Haplogroups [[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|I]] and [[Haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|G]] are also characteristic markers for many different West European populations. Haplogroups [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] and [[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] (M35, M78, M81 and M34) consist of lineages with differential distribution within Middle East, North Africa and Europe. Only adults with French surnames were analyzed by the study.&lt;ref&gt;Ramos-Luisa et al.

[[Provence]], a province of southern France was colonized by Ancient Greeks who founded the cities of [[Marseilles]] and [[Nice]]. A study in 2011 found that 17% of the Y-chromosomes (exclusive to males) of Marseilles may be attributed to Greek colonization, predicting a maximum of a 10% Greek contribution into the local population as opposed to Celto-Ligurian autochthonous input, suggesting a Greek male elite-dominant input into the Iron Age Provence population. There was also some evidence for limited Greek influence in Corsica.&lt;ref name="Chiaroni, Jacques 2011"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/69/abstract |author= Chiaroni, Jacques |title= The coming of the Greeks to Provence and Corsica: Y-chromosome models of archaic Greek colonization of the western Mediterranean |publisher=BMC Evolutionary Biology |year= 2011|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-69 |quote= The process of Greek colonization of the central and western Mediterranean during the Archaic and Classical Eras has been understudied from the perspective of population genetics. To investigate the Y chromosomal demography of Greek colonization in the western Mediterranean, Y-chromosome data consisting of 29 YSNPs and 37 YSTRs were compared from 51 subjects from Provence, 58 subjects from Smyrna and 31 subjects whose paternal ancestry derives from Asia Minor Phokaia, the ancestral embarkation port to the 6th century BCE Greek colonies of Massalia (Marseilles) and Alalie (Aleria, Corsica). Results 19% of the Phokaian and 12% of the Smyrnian representatives were derived for haplogroup E-V13, characteristic of the Greek and Balkan mainland, while 4% of the Provencal, 4.6% of East Corsican and 1.6% of West Corsican samples were derived for E-V13. An admixture analysis estimated that 17% of the Y-chromosomes of Provence may be attributed to Greek colonization. Using the following putative Neolithic Anatolian lineages: J2a-DYS445 = 6, G2a-M406 and J2a1b1-M92, the data predict a 0% Neolithic contribution to Provence from Anatolia. Estimates of colonial Greek vs. indigenous Celto-Ligurian demography predict a maximum of a 10% Greek contribution, suggesting a Greek male elite-dominant input into the Iron Age Provence population. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationality and citizenship===
{{Further information|Nationality|Citizenship}}

French nationality has not meant automatic citizenship. Some categories of French people have been excluded, throughout the years, from full citizenship:
* [[Women's suffrage|Women]]: until the Liberation, they were deprived of the [[right to vote]]. The [[provisional government of the French Republic|provisional government]] of General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] accorded them this right by the 21 April 1944 prescription. However, women still suffer from under-representation in the political class. The 6 June 2000 law on parity attempted to address this question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite French law|number or usual name=n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 2000-493|date in French=6 juin 2000|full name=tendant à favoriser l'égal accès des femmes et des hommes aux mandats électoraux et fonctions électives|language=French|URL=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000400185&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French Army|Military]]: for a long time, it was called "''la grande muette''" ("the great mute") in reference to its prohibition from interfering in political life. During a large part of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940), the Army was in its majority [[republicanism|anti-republican]] (and thus [[counterrevolutionary]]). The [[Dreyfus Affair]] and the [[Seize Mai|16 May 1877 crisis]], which almost led to a [[monarchist]] ''[[coup d'état]]'' by [[Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta|MacMahon]], are examples of this anti-republican spirit. Therefore, they would only gain the right to vote with the 17 August 1945 prescription: the contribution of De Gaulle to the interior [[French Resistance]] reconciled the Army with the Republic. Nevertheless, militaries do not benefit from the whole of public liberties, as the 13 July 1972 law on the general statute of militaries specify.
* Young people: the July 1974 law, voted at the instigation of president [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], reduced from 21 to 18 the [[age of majority]].
* [[Naturalization|Naturalized foreigners]]: since the 9 January 1973 law, foreigners who have acquired French nationality do not have to wait five years after their naturalization to be able to vote anymore.
* [[French colonial empires|Inhabitants of the colonies]]: the 7 May 1946 law meant that soldiers from the "Empire" (such as the ''[[tirailleurs]]'') killed during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] were not citizens.&lt;ref name="Citizenship"&gt;{{cite web| author=B. Villalba| title=Chapitre 2 - Les incertitudes de la citoyenneté| accessdate=2006-05-03| publisher=Catholic University of [[Lille]], Law Department| url=http://droit.univ-lille2.fr/enseignants/villalba/cours_PSC/Psc_chap_citoyen.html| language=fr| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116061353/http://droit.univ-lille2.fr/enseignants/villalba/cours_PSC/Psc_chap_citoyen.html| archivedate=16 November 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The special case of [[European Union citizen|foreign citizens of an EU member state]] who, even if not French, are allowed to vote in French local elections if living in France, and may turn to any French consular or diplomatic mission if there is no such representations of their own country.

France was one of the first countries to implement [[denaturalization]] laws. Philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] has pointed out this fact that the 1915 French law which permitted denaturalization with regard to naturalized citizens of "enemy" origins was one of the first example of such legislation, which [[Nazi Germany]] later implemented with the 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Giorgio Agamben]], ''[[Homo Sacer]]: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'', Stanford University Press (1998), {{ISBN|0-8047-3218-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some authors who have insisted on the "crisis of the nation-state" allege that nationality and citizenship are becoming separate concepts. They show as example "[[international]]", "[[supranational]] citizenship" or "[[world citizenship]]" (membership to [[international nongovernmental organization]]s such as [[Amnesty International]] or [[Greenpeace]]). This would indicate a path toward a "[[postnational]] citizenship".&lt;ref name="Citizenship"/&gt;

Beside this, modern citizenship is linked to [[civic participation]] (also called [[positive freedom]]), which implies voting, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], [[petition]]s, [[activism]], etc. Therefore, [[social exclusion]] may lead to deprivation of citizenship. This has led various authors ([[Philippe Van Parijs]], [[Jean-Marc Ferry]], [[Alain Caillé]], [[André Gorz]]) to theorize a [[guaranteed minimum income]] which would impede exclusion from citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} P. Hassenteufel, "Exclusion sociale et citoyenneté", "Citoyenneté et société", ''Cahiers Francais'', n° 281, mai-juin 1997), quoted by B. Villalba of the Catholic University of Lille, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiculturalism versus universalism===
[[File:AlfredAmedeeDodds.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Alfred-Amédée Dodds]], a mixed-race French general and colonial administrator born in Senegal]]
In France, the conception of citizenship teeters between [[Moral universalism|universalism]] and [[multiculturalism]], especially in recent years. French citizenship has been defined for a long time by three factors: integration, [[individualism|individual adherence]], and the primacy of the soil (''[[jus soli]]''). Political integration (which includes but is not limited to [[racial integration]]) is based on voluntary policies which aims at creating a common identity, and the interiorization by each individual of a common cultural and historic legacy. Since in France, the state preceded the nation, voluntary policies have taken an important place in the creation of this common [[cultural identity]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the interiorization of a common legacy is a slow process, which B. Villalba compares to [[acculturation]]. According to him, "integration is therefore the result of a double will: the nation's will to create a common culture for all members of the nation, and the communities' will living in the nation to recognize the legitimacy of this common culture".&lt;ref name="Citizenship"/&gt; Villalba warns against confusing recent processes of integration (related to the so-called "second generation immigrants", who are subject to [[discrimination]]), with older processes which have made modern France. Villalba thus shows that any democratic nation characterize itself by its project of transcending all forms of particular memberships (whether biological - or seen as such,&lt;ref&gt;Even the biological conception of sex may be questioned: see [[gender theory]]&lt;/ref&gt; ethnic, historic, economic, social, religious or cultural). The citizen thus emancipates himself from the particularisms of identity which characterize himself to attain a more "universal" dimension. He is a citizen, before being a member of a community or of a [[social class]]&lt;ref&gt;It may be interesting to refer to [[Michel Foucault]]'s description of the [[Philosophy of history|discourse of "race struggle"]], as he shows that this medieval discourse - held by such people as [[Edward Coke]] or [[John Lilburne]] in Great Britain, and, in France, by [[Nicolas Fréret]], [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], and then [[Sieyès]], [[Augustin Thierry]] and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]] -, tended to identify the French noble classes to a Northern and foreign race, while the "people" was considered as an [[Indigenous peoples|aborigine]] - and "inferior" races. This historical discourse of "race struggle", as isolated by Foucault, was not based on a biological conception of race, as would be latter [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racialism]] (aka "[[scientific racism]]")&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, according to Villalba, "a democratic nation is, by definition, multicultural as it gathers various populations, which differs by their regional origins (Auvergnats, Bretons, Corsicans or Lorrains...), their national origins (immigrant, son or grandson of an immigrant), or religious origins (Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Agnostics or Atheists...)."&lt;ref name="Citizenship"/&gt;

===Ernest Renan's ''What is a Nation?'' (1882)===
[[Ernest Renan]] described this republican conception in his famous 11 March 1882 conference at the [[Sorbonne]], ''Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?'' ("[[What is a Nation?]]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/bib_lisieux/nation01.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216031848/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/bib_lisieux/nation01.htm |date=16 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, to belong to a [[nation]] is a [[subjectivity|subjective]] act which always has to be repeated, as it is not assured by [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] criteria. A [[nation-state]] is not composed of a single homogeneous ethnic group (a community), but of a variety of individuals willing to live together.

Renan's non-essentialist definition, which forms the basis of the French Republic, is diametrically opposed to the [[German people|German]] ethnic conception of a nation, first formulated by [[Fichte]]. The German conception is usually qualified in France as an "exclusive" view of nationality, as it includes only the members of the corresponding ethnic group, while the Republican conception thinks itself as [[universalist]], following the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s ideals officialized by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. While Ernest Renan's arguments were also concerned by the debate about the disputed [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region, he said that not only one [[referendum]] had to be made in order to ask the opinions of the Alsatian people, but also a "daily referendum" should be made concerning all those citizens wanting to live in the French nation-state. This ''plébiscite de tous les jours'' ('everyday plebiscite') might be compared to a [[social contract]] or even to the classic definition of [[consciousness]] as an act which repeats itself endlessly.&lt;ref&gt;See [[John Locke]]'s definition of consciousness and of identity. Consciousness is an act accompanying all thoughts (I am conscious that I am thinking this or that...), and which therefore doubles all thoughts. Personal identity is composed by the repeated consciousness, and thus extends so far in time (both in the past and in the future) as I am conscious of it (''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689), Chapter XXVII "Of Identity and Diversity", available here [http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/l#a2447])&lt;/ref&gt;

Henceforth, contrary to the German definition of a nation based on objective criteria, such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[ethnic group]], which may be defined by the existence of a common [[language]], among other criteria, the people of France is defined as all the people living in the French nation-state and willing to do so, i.e. by its citizenship. This definition of the French nation-state contradicts the [[doxa|common opinion]], which holds that the concept of the French people identifies with one particular [[ethnic group]]. This contradiction explains the seeming paradox encountered when attempting to identify a "French [[ethnic group]]": the French conception of the nation is radically opposed to (and was thought in opposition to) the German conception of the ''[[Volk]]'' ("ethnic group").

This universalist conception of citizenship and of the nation has influenced the French model of [[colonialism|colonization]]. While the [[British empire]] preferred an [[indirect rule]] system, which did not mix the colonized people with the colonists, the French Republic theoretically chose an integration system and considered parts of its [[French colonial empires|colonial empire]] as France itself and its population as French people.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), second part on "Imperialism"&lt;/ref&gt; The ruthless [[French rule in Algeria|conquest of Algeria]] thus led to the integration of the territory as a [[Département]] of the French territory.

This ideal also led to the ironic sentence which opened up history textbooks in France as in its colonies: "Our ancestors the Gauls...". However, this universal ideal, rooted in the 1789 French Revolution ("bringing liberty to the people"), suffered from the [[racism]] that impregnated colonialism. Thus, in Algeria, the [[Adolphe Crémieux|Crémieux decrees]] at the end of the 19th century gave French citizenship to north African Jews, while Muslims were regulated by the 1881 Indigenous Code. Liberal author [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]] himself considered that the British model was better adapted than the French one and did not balk before the cruelties of [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud de la Piconnerie|General Bugeaud]]'s conquest. He went as far as advocating [[racial segregation]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=[[Olivier LeCour Grandmaison]]|title=Torture in Algeria: Past Acts That Haunt France - Liberty, Equality and Colony|publisher=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |date = June 2001| url=http://mondediplo.com/2001/06/11torture2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This paradoxical tension between the universalist conception of the French nation and the racism inherent in colonization is most obvious in Ernest Renan himself, who went as far as advocating a kind of [[eugenics]]. In a 26 June 1856 letter to [[Arthur de Gobineau]], author of ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–55) and one of the first theoreticians of "[[scientific racism]]", he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "You have written a remarkable book here, full of vigour and originality of mind, only it's written to be little understood in France or rather it's written to be misunderstood here. The French mind turns little to ethnographic considerations: France has little belief in race, [...]

The fact of race is huge originally; but it's been continually losing its importance, and sometimes, as in France, it happens to disappear completely. Does that mean total decadence? Yes, certainly from the standpoint of the stability of institutions, the originality of character, a certain nobility that I hold to be the most important factor in the conjunction of human affairs. But also what compensations! No doubt if the noble elements mixed in the blood of a people happened to disappear completely, then there would be a demeaning equality, like that of some Eastern states and in some respects China. But it is in fact a very small amount of noble blood put into the circulation of a people that is enough to ennoble them, at least as to historical effects; this is how France, a nation so completely fallen into commonness, in practice plays on the world stage the role of a gentleman. Setting aside the quite inferior races whose intermingling with the great races would only poison the human species, I see in the future a homogeneous humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Renan]]'s 26 June 1856 letter to [[Arthur de Gobineau]], quoted by Jacques Morel in ''[http://perso.wanadoo.fr/jacques.morel67/ccfo/crimcol/node60.html Calendrier des crimes de la France outre-mer]'', [[L'esprit frappeur]], 2001 (Morel gives as source: Ernest Renan, ''Qu'est-ce qu'une nation? et autres textes politiques'', chosen and presented by Joël Roman, [[Presses Pocket]], 1992, p 221.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Jus soli'' and ''jus sanguinis''===
{{Main article|French nationality law}}

During the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' (before the 1789 French revolution), ''[[jus soli]]'' (or "right of territory") was predominant. Feudal law recognized personal allegeance to the [[Monarch|sovereign]], but the subjects of the sovereign were defined by their birthland. According to the 3 September 1791 Constitution, those who are born in France from a foreign father and have fixed their residency in France, or those who, after being born in foreign country from a French father, have come to France and have sworn their civil oath, become French citizens. Because of the war, distrust toward foreigners led to the obligation on the part of this last category to swear a civil oath in order to gain French nationality.

However, the [[Napoleonic Code]] would insist on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' ("right of blood"). [[Paternity (law)|Paternity]], against Napoléon Bonaparte's wish, became the principal criterion of nationality, and therefore broke for the first time with the ancient tradition of ''jus soli'', by breaking any residency condition toward children born abroad from French parents. However, according to [[Patrick Weil]], it was not "ethnically motivated" but "only meant that family links transmitted by the pater familias had become more important than subjecthood".&lt;ref&gt;"In eighteenth-century Europe, jus soli was the dominant criterion of nationality law in the two most powerful kingdoms : France and United Kingdom. It was the transfer of a feudal tradition to the state level : human beings were linked to the lord who held the land where they were born. The French Revolution broke from this feudal tradition. Because jus soli connoted feudal allegiance, it was decided, ''against Napoléon Bonaparte's wish'', that the new Civil Code of 1804 would grant French nationality at birth only to a child born to a French father, either in France or abroad . It was not ethnically motivated; it only meant that family links transmitted by the pater familias had become more important than subjecthood", [[Patrick Weil]], [http://www.patrick-weil.com/Fichiers%20du%20site/2001%20-%20Access%20to%20citizenship.doc Access to citizenship : A comparison of twenty five nationality laws ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501102440/http://www.patrick-weil.com/Fichiers%20du%20site/2001%20-%20Access%20to%20citizenship.doc |date=1 May 2011 }}, dans T. Alexander Aleinikoff and Douglas Klusmeyer (ed.), Citizenship Today: Global Perspectives and Practices, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington DC, 2001, p.17-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 7 February 1851 law, voted during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] (1848–1852), "double ''jus soli''" was introduced in French legislation, combining birth origin with paternity. Thus, it gave French nationality to the child of a foreigner, if both are born in France, except if the year following his coming of age he reclaims a foreign nationality (thus prohibiting [[dual nationality]]). This 1851 law was in part passed because of [[conscription]] concerns. This system more or less remained the same until the 1993 reform of the Nationality Code, created by the 9 January 1973 law.

The 1993 reform, which defines the [[French Nationality law|Nationality law]], is deemed controversial by some. It commits young people born in France to foreign parents to solicit French nationality between the ages of 16 and 21. This has been criticized, some arguing that the principle of equality before the law was not complied with, since French nationality was no longer given automatically at birth, as in the classic "double ''jus soli''" law, but was to be requested when approaching adulthood. Henceforth, children born in France from French parents were differentiated from children born in France from foreign parents, creating a hiatus between these two categories.

The 1993 reform was prepared by the [[Charles Pasqua|Pasqua laws]]. The first Pasqua law, in 1986, restricts residence conditions in France and facilitates [[Deportation|expulsion]]s. With this 1986 law, a child born in France from foreign parents can only acquire French nationality if he or she demonstrates his or her will to do so, at age 16, by proving that he or she has been schooled in France and has a sufficient command of the French language. This new policy is symbolized by the expulsion of 101 [[Mali]]ans by [[charter airlines|charter]].&lt;ref name="Citizenship"/&gt;

The second Pasqua law on "immigration control" makes regularisation of illegal aliens more difficult and, in general, residence conditions for foreigners much harder. Charles Pasqua, who said on 11 May 1987: "Some have reproached me of having used a plane, but, if necessary, I will use trains", declared to ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 2 June 1993: "France has been a country of immigration, it doesn't want to be one anymore. Our aim, taking into account the difficulties of the economic situation, is to tend toward 'zero immigration' ("''immigration zéro''")".&lt;ref name="Citizenship"/&gt;

Therefore, modern French nationality law combines four factors: paternality or 'right of blood', birth origin, residency and the will expressed by a foreigner, or a person born in France to foreign parents, to become French.

===European citizenship===
{{Main article|Citizenship of the European Union}}
The 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] introduced the concept of [[Citizenship of the European Union|European citizenship]], which comes in addition to national citizenships.

===Citizenship of foreigners===
By definition, a "[[alien (law)|foreigner]]" is someone who does not have French nationality. Therefore, it is ''not'' a synonym of "[[immigration|immigrant]]", as a foreigner may be born in France. On the other hand, a Frenchman born abroad may be considered an immigrant (e.g. former prime minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] who lived the majority of his life abroad). In most of the cases, however, a foreigner is an immigrant, and vice versa. They either benefit from legal sojourn in France, which, after a residency of ten years, makes it possible to ask for [[naturalisation]].&lt;ref&gt;This ten-year clause is threatened by Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s law proposition on immigration.&lt;/ref&gt; If they do not, they are considered "[[alien (law)|illegal aliens]]". Some argue that this privation of nationality and citizenship does not square with their contribution to the national economic efforts, and thus to [[economic growth]].

In any cases, rights of foreigners in France have improved over the last half-century:
* 1946: right to elect [[trade union]] representative (but not to be elected as a representative)
* 1968: right to become a trade-union delegate
* 1972: right to sit in [[works council]] and to be a delegate of the workers at the condition of "knowing how to read and write French"
* 1975: additional condition: "to be able to express oneself in French"; they may vote at ''prud'hommes elections'' ("industrial tribunal elections") but may not be elected; foreigners may also have administrative or leadership positions in tradeunions but under various conditions
* 1982: those conditions are suppressed, only the function of ''conseiller prud'hommal'' is reserved to those who have acquired French nationality. They may be elected in workers' representation functions (Auroux laws). They also may become administrators in public structures such as [[Social security]] banks (''caisses de sécurité sociale''), OPAC (which administers [[HLM]]s), Ophlm...
* 1992: for European Union citizens, right to vote at the European elections, first exercised during the [[European Parliament election, 1994|1994 European elections]], and at municipal elections (first exercised during the 2001 municipal elections).

===Statistics===

The [[INSEE]] does not collect data about language, religion, or ethnicity – on the principle of the secular and unitary nature of the French Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2003/april/ethrellangroups Ethnic, Religious and Language Groups: Towards a Set of Rules for Data Collection and Statistical Analysis], Werner Haug&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are some sources dealing with just such distinctions:

*The [[CIA World Factbook]] defines the ethnic groups of France as being "Celtic and Latin with Teutonic, Slavic, North African, Sub-Saharan African, Indochinese, and Basque minorities. Overseas departments: black, white, mulatto, East Indian, Chinese, Amerindian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fr.html |title=CIA Factbook - France |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nXdBl0QT?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fr.html |archivedate=14 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its definition is reproduced on several Web sites collecting or reporting demographic data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationbynation.com/France/Population.html France Population] - Nation by Nation&lt;/ref&gt;
*The U.S. Department of State goes into further detail: "Since prehistoric times, France has been a crossroads of trade, travel, and invasion. Three basic [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] [[ethnic]] stocks – Celtic, Latin, and Teutonic (Frankish) – have blended over the centuries to make up its present population. . . . Traditionally, France has had a high level of immigration. . . . In 2004, there were over 6 million Muslims, largely of North African descent, living in France.

*The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] says that "the French are strongly conscious of belonging to a single nation, but they hardly constitute a unified ethnic group by any scientific gauge", and it mentions as part of the population of France the [[Basques]], the [[Celts]] (called [[Gauls]] by Romans), and the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] (Teutonic) peoples (including the [[Norsemen]] or [[Vikings]]). France also became "in the 19th and especially in the 20th century, the prime recipient of foreign immigration into Europe. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-41116/France Encyclopædia Britannica Article: French ethnic groups].

As of 2008, the French national institute of statistics [[INSEE]] estimated that 5,3 million foreign-born immigrants and 6,5 million direct descendants of immigrants (born in France with at least one immigrant parent) lived in France representing a total of 11.8 million and 19% of the total population in [[metropolitan France]] (62,1 million in 2008). Among them, about 5,5 million are of [[Europe]]an origin and 4 million of North African origin.&lt;ref name="insee.fr"&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=ip1287 Être né en France d'un parent immigré], [[Insee Première]], n°1287, mars 2010, Catherine Borrel et Bertrand Lhommeau, Insee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Insee_1"&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=immigrespaysnais Répartition des immigrés par pays de naissance 2008], Insee, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There are nearly seven million French speakers out of nine to ten million people of French and partial French ancestry in [[Canada]]. The Canadian province of [[Quebec]] (2006 census population of 7,546,131), where more than 95 percent of the people speak French as either their first, second or even third language, is the center of French life on the Western side of the Atlantic; however, French settlement began further east, in [[Acadia]]. Quebec is home to vibrant French-language arts, media, and learning. There are sizable [[French-Canadian]] communities scattered throughout the other provinces of Canada, particularly in [[Ontario]], which has about 1 million people with French ancestry (400 000 who have French as their mother tongue), [[Manitoba]], and [[New Brunswick]], which is the only fully [[bilingual]] province and is 33 percent [[Acadian]].

===United States===
{{See also|French American}}

The United States is home to an estimated 13 to 16 million people of [[French American|French descent]], or 4 to 5 percent of the US population, particularly in [[Louisiana]], [[New England]] and parts of the [[Midwest]]. The French community in Louisiana consists of the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], the descendants of the French settlers who arrived when Louisiana was a French colony, and the [[Cajuns]], the descendants of [[Acadia]]n refugees from the [[Great Upheaval]]. Very few creoles remain in New Orleans in present times. In New England, the vast majority of French immigration in the 19th and early 20th centuries came not from France, but from over the border in Quebec, the [[Quebec diaspora]]. These French Canadians arrived to work in the timber mills and textile plants that appeared throughout the region as it industrialized. Today, nearly 25 percent of the population of [[New Hampshire]] is of French ancestry, the highest of any state.

English and Dutch colonies of pre-Revolutionary America attracted large numbers of French [[Huguenots]] fleeing religious persecution in France. In the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] that later became New York, northern New Jersey, and western [[Connecticut]], these French Huguenots, nearly identical in religion to the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], assimilated almost completely into the Dutch community. However, large it may have been at one time, it has lost all identity of its French origin, often with the translation of names (examples: ''de la Montagne'' &amp;gt; ''Vandenberg'' by translation; ''de Vaux'' &amp;gt; ''DeVos'' or ''Devoe'' by phonetic respelling). Huguenots appeared in all of the English colonies and likewise assimilated. Even though this mass settlement approached the size of the settlement of the French settlement of Quebec, it has assimilated into the English-speaking mainstream to a much greater extent than other French colonial groups and has left few traces of cultural influence. [[New Rochelle, New York]] is named after [[La Rochelle]], France, one of the sources of Huguenot emigration to the Dutch colony; and [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz, New York]], is one of the few non-urban settlements of Huguenots that did not undergo massive recycling of buildings in the usual redevelopment of such older, larger cities as New York City or New Rochelle.

===Argentina===
{{See also|French Argentine}}

French Argentines form the third largest ancestry group in [[Argentina]], after Italian and Spanish Argentines. Most of French immigrants came to Argentina between 1871 and 1890, though considerable immigration continued until the late 1940s. At least half of these immigrants came from Southwestern France, especially from the Basque Country, Béarn (Basses-Pyrénées accounted for more than 20% of immigrants), Bigorre and Rouergue but also from Savoy and the Paris region. Today around 6.8&amp;nbsp;million Argentines have some degree of French ancestry or are of partial or wholly of French descent (up to 17% of the total population).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canalacademie.com/Les-merveilleux-francophiles,1009.html Canal Académie: Les merveilleux francophiles argentins] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605035505/http://www.canalacademie.com/Les-merveilleux-francophiles,1009.html |date=5 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; French Argentines had a considerable influence over the country, particularly on its architectural styles and literary traditions, as well as on the scientific field. Some notable Argentines of French descent include writer [[Julio Cortázar]], physiologist and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Bernardo Houssay]] or activist [[Alicia Moreau de Justo]].
With something akin to Latin culture, the French immigrants quickly assimilated into mainstream Argentine society.

===Uruguay===
{{Main article|French Uruguayan}}

French Uruguayans form the third largest ancestry group in [[Uruguay]], after Italian and Spanish Uruguayans. During the first half of the 19th century, [[Uruguay]] received mostly French immigrants to [[South America]]. It constituted back then the second receptor of French immigrants in the [[New World]] after the [[United States]]. Thus, while the [[United States]] received 195,971 French immigrants between 1820 and 1855, 13,922 Frenchmen, most of them from the [[Northern Basque Country|Basque Country]] and [[Béarn]], left for Uruguay between 1833 and 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ecrivainsargentins.viabloga.com/news/l-immigration-francaise-en-argentine-1850-1930 |title=L'immigration française en Argentine, 1850–1930 |quote=L'Uruguay capta seulement 13.922 [immigrants français] entre 1833 et 1842, la plupart d'entre eux originaires du Pays Basque et du Béarn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of immigrants were coming from the [[Northern Basque Country|Basque Country]], [[Béarn]] and [[Bigorre]]. Today, there are an estimated at 300,000 French descendants in Uruguay.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Uruguay-MIGRATION.html|title=Migration - Uruguay|website=Nationsencyclopedia.com|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|French British}}

[[French migration to the United Kingdom]] is a phenomenon that has occurred at various points in history. Many British people have French ancestry, and French remains the foreign language most learned by British people. Much of the UK's mediaeval [[aristocracy]] was descended from [[France|Franco]]-[[Normans|Norman]] migrants at the time of the [[Norman Conquest of England]], and also during the [[Angevin Empire]] of the [[Plantagenet]] dynasty.

According to a study by [[Ancestry.com|Ancestry.co.uk]], 3 million British people are of French descent.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7578817/Britons-can-trace-French-ancestry-after-millions-of-records-go-online.html |title=Britons can trace French ancestry after millions of records go online|quote=The documents disclose that despite our rivalry with our continental counterparts, 3 million Britons - one in 20 – can trace their ancestry back to France. | location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Murray |last=Wardrop |date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those are television presenters [[Davina McCall]] and [[Louis Theroux]]. There are currently an estimated 400,000 French people in the United Kingdom, most of them in [[London]].&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18234930 |title=London, France's sixth biggest city|quote=The French consulate in London estimates between 300,000 and 400,000 French citizens live in the British capital|publisher=BBC News |date=2012-05-30 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-bz.expats04sep04,0,717461.story?track=rss |title=Sarkozy raises hopes of expats |publisher=Baltimoresun.com |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043810/http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-bz.expats04sep04,0,717461.story?track=rss |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costa Rica===
The first French emigration in [[Costa Rica]] was a very small number to [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] in the mid-nineteenth century. Due to [[World War II]], a group of exiled French (mostly soldiers and families orphaned) migrated to the country.&lt;ref name="fr-cri"&gt;[http://www.genealogia.or.cr/docs/revistas/accg_revista012.pdf Los franco-ticos la genealogía y la paz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524080817/http://www.genealogia.or.cr/docs/revistas/accg_revista012.pdf |date=24 May 2015 }} October 2008, {{ISSN|1659-3529}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{See also|French immigration to Mexico}}

In [[Mexico]], a sizeable population can trace its ancestry to France. After Spain, this makes France the second largest European ethnicity in the country. The bulk of French immigrants arrived in Mexico during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

From 1814 to 1955, inhabitants of [[Barcelonnette]] and the surrounding [[Ubaye Valley]] emigrated to Mexico by the dozens. Many established textile businesses between Mexico and France. At the turn of the 20th century, there were 5,000 French families from the Barcelonnette region registered with the French Consulate in Mexico. While 90% stayed in Mexico, some returned, and from 1880 to 1930, built grand mansions called ''Maisons Mexicaines'' and left a mark upon the city.

In the 1860s, during the [[Second Mexican Empire]] ruled by Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]]—which was part of [[Napoleon III]]'s scheme to create a Latin empire in the New World (indeed responsible for coining the term of "Amérique latine", "Latin America" in English)-- many French soldiers, merchants, and families set foot upon Mexican soil. Emperor Maximilian's consort, [[Charlotte of Belgium|Carlota of Mexico]], a Belgian princess, was a granddaughter of [[Louis-Philippe I, King of the French|Louis-Philippe of France]].

Many Mexicans of French descent live in cities or states such as [[Zacatecas]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Monterrey]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], and the capital, [[Mexico City]], where French surnames such as Chairez/Chaires, Renaux, Pierres, Michel, Betancourt, Alaniz, Blanc, Ney, Jurado (Jure), Colo (Coleau), Dumas, or Moussier can be found.

===Chile===
{{Main article|French Chilean}}

The French came to Chile in the 18th century, arriving at [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] as merchants, and in the mid-19th century to cultivate vines in the [[haciendas]] of the [[Central Valley of Chile|Central Valley]], the homebase of world-famous [[Chilean wine]]. The [[Araucanía Region]] also has an important number of people of French ancestry, as the area hosted settlers arrived by the second half of the 19th century as farmers and shopkeepers. With something akin to [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin culture]], the French immigrants quickly assimilated into mainstream Chilean society.

From 1840 to 1940, around 25,000 Frenchmen immigrated to Chile. 80% of them were coming from Southwestern France, especially from [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Basses-Pyrénées]] ([[Northern Basque Country|Basque country]] and [[Béarn]]), [[Gironde]], [[Charente-Maritime|Charente-Inférieure]] and [[Charente]] and regions situated between [[Gers]] and [[Dordogne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alhim.revues.org/index1252.html |title=La emigración francesa en Chile, 1875–1914  |quote=El 80% de los colonos que llegan a Chile provienen del País Vasco, del Bordelais, de Charentes y de las regiones situadas entre Gers y Périgord. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of French immigrants settled in the country between 1875 and 1895. Between October 1882 and December 1897, 8,413 Frenchmen settled in Chile, making up 23% of immigrants (second only after Spaniards) from this period. In 1863, 1,650 French citizens were registered in Chile. At the end of the century they were almost 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uai.cl/p3_humanidades/site/edic/20030530094405/asocfile/ASOCFILE220030428191759.pdf|format=PDF|title=La influencia francesa en la vida social de Chile de la segunda mitad del siglo XIX|quote=Los datos que poseía el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Francia ya en 1863, cuando aúno se abría Agencia General de Colonización del Gobierno de Chile en Europa, con sede en París, daban cuenta de 1.650 ciudadanos franceses residentes.

Today it is estimated that 500,000 Chileans are of French descent.

Former president of Chile, [[Michelle Bachelet]] is of French origin, as was [[Augusto Pinochet]]. A large percentage of politicians, businessmen, professionals and entertainers in the country are of French ancestry.

It is estimated that there are 1 million to 2 million or more Brazilians of French descent today. This gives Brazil the second largest French community in South America.&lt;ref name="studyrama1965"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vivrealetranger.studyrama.com/article.php3?id_article=216 |title=Vivre à l'étranger |quote=Ils ont été 100 000 à émigrer dans ce pays entre 1850 et 1965 et auraient entre 500 000 et 1 million de descendants.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1819 to 1940, 40,383 Frenchmen immigrated to [[Brazil]]. Most of them settled in the country between 1884 and 1925 (8,008 from 1819 to 1883, 25,727 from 1884 to 1925, 6,648 from 1926 to 1940). Another source estimates that around 100,000 French people immigrated to Brazil between 1850 and 1965.

The French community in Brazil numbered 592 in 1888 and 5,000 in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiqFIaY0LpEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en |title=Possible paradises: Basque emigration to Latin America |quote=The French colony in this country numbered 592 in 1888 and 5,000 in 1915 (page 226).}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that 14,000 Frenchmen were living in Brazil in 1912, 9% of the 149,400 Frenchmen living in [[Latin America]], the second largest community after Argentina (100,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDCbEhbfNMMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0 |title=L'Amérique latine et l'Europe à l'heure de la mondialisation |quote=p. 194.

The [[Brazilian Imperial Family]] originates from the Portuguese House of Braganza and the last emperor's heir and daughter, Isabella, married Prince Gaston d'Orleans, Comte d'Eu, a member of the [[House of Orléans]], a cadet branch of the Bourbons, the French Royal Family.

===Guatemala===
{{See also|French Guatemalan}}
The first French immigrants were politicians such as Nicolas Raoul and Isidore Saget, Henri Terralonge and officers Aluard, Courbal, Duplessis, Gibourdel and Goudot. Later, when the [[Central American Federation]] was divided in 7 countries, Some of them settled to [[Costa Rica]], others to [[Nicaragua]], although the majority still remained in [[Guatemala]]. The relationships start to 1827, politicians, scientists, painters, builders, singers and some families emigrated to Guatemala. Later in a Conservative government, annihilated nearly all the relations between [[France]] and [[Guatemala]], and most of French immigrants went to [[Costa Rica]], but these relationships were again return to the late of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;''Asociación para el Fomento de los Estudios Históricos en Centroamérica (AFEHC)'' [http://www.afehc-historia-centroamericana.org/index.php?action=fi_aff&amp;id=1497 Relaciones entre Francia y Guatemala (1823–1954)] Guatemala, 2007.

Many people in these countries still bear French names.

===Asia===
[[File:Puducherry EFEO.jpg|thumb|left| Building of the [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] in [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]]]]
In Asia, a proportion of people with mixed French and Vietnamese descent can be found in Vietnam. Including the number of persons of pure French descent. Many are descendants of French settlers who intermarried with local Vietnamese people. Approximately 5,000 in Vietnam are of pure French descent, however, this number is disputed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/detail.asp?ref_id=ir-sd20101 Naissances selon le pays de naissance des parents 2010], Insee, septembre 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A few thousand [[French people in India|French citizens]] of Indian, European or creole ethnic origins live in the former French possessions in India (mostly [[Pondicherry]]).
In addition to these Countries, small minorities can be found elsewhere in Asia; the majority of these living as expatriates.&lt;ref name="joshuaproject.net"/&gt;

==Ecclesiastical ministry==
Devasahayam began teaching at the Lutheran Theological College in [[Rajahmundry]] from 1944 onwards until his elevation to the Presidency of the Lutheran Society in 1956 and again in 1963 when Devasahayam proceeded to Guntur to take up the responsibilities of the Society.  After his second stint as President ended in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times of India Directory and Year Book Including Who's who'', Bennett and Coleman, Calcutta, 1964, p.88.

'''Ghanaian Arabs''' ([[Akan language|Akan]]: ''Nkɔmbɔtwetwe Arabia Gaana''; {{lang-ar|''' غانيون عرب'''}}) are [[Ghanaian people|Ghanaians]] and [[Ghanaian nationality law|citizens]] of [[Arab]] origin or descent. Ghanaian Arabs are mainly from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Maghreb|Arab Maghreb]]. Ghana has the largest [[Arab]] population in western Africa.

== Distribution ==
The vast majority of Arabs live in major cities and towns in south central, south eastern, south western or southern Ghana. Coastal cities such as [[Accra]], [[Cape Coast]], [[Sekondi-Takoradi]], and [[Tema]] also have Arab populations. Apart from Accra and Kumasi, Coastal Areas and Southern Ghana, there are Arab communities in [[Koforidua]] and  [[Sunyani]].

== Background ==
[[File:Fathia Nkrumah with son Gamal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[First Lady of Ghana]], [[Fathia Nkrumah]] with son [[Gamal Nkrumah]] the [[International relations|international affairs]] [[editor]] of ''[[Al Ahram Weekly]]'' [[newspaper]] of [[Egypt]].]]
[[Arab]]s have been present in Ghana for millennia, mostly as [[merchant]]s in the 15th century, then into the 21st century as [[Business person|business people]], and due to this intermarriage has occurred with also the production offsprings of [[Afro-Arab]]s; [[Fathia Nkrumah]] is a notable [[Arab]] with ties to Ghana. She was the late wife of Ghana's first president and revolutionist [[Kwame Nkrumah]], whose marriage was seen as helping plant the seeds of cooperation between [[Egypt]] and other African countries as they struggled for independence from European colonization. This helped advance the formation of the [[African Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ausummit-accra.org.gh/index1.php?linkid=289&amp;adate=04%2F07%2F2007&amp;archiveid=140&amp;page=1 African Union Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307113837/http://ausummit-accra.org.gh/index1.php?linkid=289&amp;adate=04%2F07%2F2007&amp;archiveid=140&amp;page=1 |date=2012-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabs who have lived in Ghana for most of their lives have acquired [[Ghanaian nationality law|Ghanaian citizenship]].

==Economics==
Mostly [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Business person|business people]] or [[Syria|Syrians]] own [[business]]es, such as [[restaurant]]s, [[hotel chain]]s, import and export companies. Historically Arab [[merchant]]s have been operating in Ghana and across Sub-Saharan Africa for millennia.&lt;ref name="History of the Ashanti Goldfields Company"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Ghana.aspx Migration in Ghana].

Iraq is both a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to [[human trafficking|trafficking in persons]], specifically [[forced prostitution]] and [[forced labor]]. Iraqi women and girls, some as young as 11 years old, are subjected to conditions of human trafficking within the country and in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and possibly [[Yemen]] for forced prostitution and [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] within households.

In some cases, women are lured into forced sexual exploitation through false promises of work. The more prevalent means of human trafficking is through sale or [[forced marriage]]. Family members have coerced girls and women into prostitution to escape desperate economic circumstances, to pay debts, or to resolve disputes between families. Some women and girls are trafficked within Iraq for the purpose of sexual exploitation through the traditional institution of temporary marriages ([[mutaa|muta’a]]). Under this arrangement, the family receives a [[dowry]] from the husband and the marriage is terminated after a specified period. Iraqi males have also taken advantage of muta’a to traffic multiple women into other Iraqi provinces or neighboring countries, especially Syria, for the purposes of forced prostitution. Anecdotal reports tell of desperate Iraqi families abandoning their children at the Syrian border with the expectation that traffickers on the Syrian side will pick them up and arrange forged documents so the young women and girls can stay in Syria in exchange for working in a nightclub or [[brothel]]. The large population of [[internally displaced person]]s and [[refugee]]s moving within Iraq and across its borders are particularly at risk of being trafficked.&lt;ref name="dos"&gt;"Iraq". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142760.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq is a destination country for men and women who migrate from [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nepal]], [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Jordan, and [[Uganda]] and are subsequently subjected to conditions of forced labor as construction workers, security guards, cleaners, handymen, and [[domestic worker]]s. Such men and women often reported their employers seized workers’ passports and official documents, refused to honor employment contracts, and made threats of deportation as a means to keep them in a situation of forced labor. Some governments ban their nationals from working in Iraq. These bans are not effective, however, as many [[migrant worker|migrating laborers]] and labor brokers circumvent the law. Some of these foreign migrants were recruited for work in other countries such as Jordan or the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] but were forced or coerced to travel to Iraq, where their passports were confiscated and their wages withheld, ostensibly to repay labor brokers for the costs of recruitment, transport, and food and lodging. Other foreign migrants were aware they were destined for Iraq but once in-country, found the terms of employment were not what they expected or the jobs they were promised did not exist, and they faced coercion and serious harm, financial or otherwise, if they attempted to leave. In one case that came to light last year, 14 Ugandan women were subjected to forced labor in Iraq. These women were told they would work on U.S. military bases as domestic workers, although no U.S. contractors or subcontractors were involved in bringing them to Iraq. Upon arrival, the women were sent to work as domestic workers for private Iraqi families and received significantly lower wages. Some of the women were locked in rooms, had their passports stolen, and were physically or [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by either the recruitment agent or the employer, practices potentially used to keep them in compelled service.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

Some Iraqi boys from poor families are subjected to forced street begging and other nonconsensual labor exploitation and forced commercial sexual exploitation. Some women from [[Ethiopia]], Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines who migrated to the area under the jurisdiction of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] (KRG) experienced conditions of involuntary domestic servitude after being recruited with offers of different jobs. An Iraqi official revealed networks of women have been involved in the [[trafficking of children|trafficking and sale of male and female children]] for the purposes of forced prostitution. There were reports some Iraqi boys were trafficked internally for the purpose of [[organ donation]]; [[Baghdad]] hospitals did not question the “voluntary” donation because often the father of the boy was present. There have been isolated cases of Iraqi border forces intercepting older men and young girls attempting to travel together out of Iraq using fake documents; [[NGO]]s contend these are cases of trafficking. Anecdotal evidence and media reports suggested some trafficking victims were taken from orphanages and other charitable institutions by employees of these organizations.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The Government of Iraq does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so in spite of resource and capability constraints. The Iraqi government continued to move its draft anti-trafficking bill through its [[Government of Iraq#Legislative branch|legislative structures]]. Because the determination that Iraq is making significant efforts is based on indications of a commitment to take additional future steps over the next year, particularly the passage of the anti-trafficking law. U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2 Watchlist"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The government made minimal progress in its anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts over the past year. The 2005 [[Constitution of Iraq|Iraqi Constitution]] prohibits forced labor, [[slavery]], [[slave trade]], trafficking in women or children, and [[sex trade]], though the Constitution does not prescribe specific punishments for these acts and it cannot be used to prosecute offenders. The Government of Iraq has not yet passed its anti-trafficking draft legislation; however, it is reported the legislation finally progressed through the [[Shura Council]]. Although no single law defines trafficking in persons or establishes it as a criminal offense, various provisions of Iraqi law apply to trafficking. During the last six months, the Iraqi government initiated both a criminal and a human rights investigation into an alleged labor trafficking crime, which resulted in the issuance of two arrest warrants. There were no mechanisms to collect data on offenses or enforcement. There was some evidence of complicity in trafficking by officials. An investigation of alleged trafficking involving the director of a women’s shelter in the KRG area last year had not been completed at the time of this report.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Iraqi government demonstrated minimal efforts to ensure that victims of trafficking were given access to protective services during the reporting period. Iraq did not have formal procedures to identify victims of trafficking among vulnerable groups, such as women arrested for prostitution or foreign workers imported to Iraq by labor brokers, some of whom reportedly provided workers for U.S. [[government contractor]]s and [[sub-contractor]]s. The government did not fund even temporary shelters for trafficking victims, and did not show efforts to develop or implement procedures by which government officials systematically refer victims to organizations providing legal, medical, or psychological services. However, two ministries refer adult and juvenile detainees to medical screening if they report abuse; reports of abuse of juvenile detainees are investigated, although the results of these investigations are not known. All care is administered by NGOs, which run victim-care facilities and shelters accessible to victims of trafficking. Because [[coercion]] is not recognized in Iraqi courts as a legal defense for engaging in an unlawful act, women who have been coerced into prostitution have been prosecuted and convicted. [[Sex trafficking]] victims reportedly were prosecuted for prostitution and some spent several months in detention awaiting trial. In the few known cases of children who were forced into armed service, the child victims were prosecuted for [[terrorism]] offenses. Some child trafficking victims were placed in protective facilities, orphanages, and [[foster care]], while others were placed in [[juvenile detention]] centers. Since trafficking is not established as a crime in Iraq, the government did not encourage victims to assist in investigations or prosecution. Foreign victims had no legal protection against removal to countries in which they may face hardship or retribution. Iraq did not assist foreign trafficking victims by providing temporary or [[permanent residency]] status or other relief from [[deportation]]. There was no victims’ [[restitution]] program. In August 2009, the Iraqi government assisted in the [[repatriation]] of the 14 Ugandan women subjected to forced labor in Iraq. Iraq did not provide any specialized training for government officials to identify trafficking victims. Furthermore, the government denied permission for an NGO to visit Baghdad’s women’s prison, where the NGO had previously identified trafficking victims among women detained for offenses committed as a result of being trafficked.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Government of Iraq took minimal efforts to prevent trafficking in persons during the reporting period. The Ministry of Human Rights, working in tandem with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, initiated a public awareness campaign aimed at educating children at schools and youth centers across the country about trafficking. However, the government has not yet created an effective mechanism to disseminate awareness information to front-line [[Iraqi police|law enforcement officers]] who are most likely to come into contact with trafficking victims. Law enforcement officials did not consistently screen people leaving or entering Iraq for evidence of trafficking, and the borders of Iraq remained generally unsecured. The Iraqi government had not taken steps to end the practice of forced marriages and curb the use of temporary marriages, which can result in situations of sexual and involuntary domestic servitude; and it had not regulated recruitment practices of foreign labor brokers to prevent practices facilitating forced labor. The Supreme Committee to Combat Human Trafficking, an inter-ministerial committee composed of members from the Ministries of Human Rights, Foreign Affairs, and Labor and Social Affairs, continued to serve as a coordinating body on human trafficking issues, though it wielded no special authority to implement its recommendations.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

Drugs become '''known for off-label use''' when publications begin discussing how they can be used for [[off-label use|off-label treatment]] of medical conditions.

==List==
* [[Actiq]] (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate), a [[controlled substance]], is used off-label to treat moderate to severe chronic, non-malignant pain even though it is approved in the United States solely for [[breakthrough pain]] in cancer patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paduda |first=Joe |url=http://www.joepaduda.com/archives/000875.html |title=UPDATE - The lollypop story gets big - Managed Care Matters |publisher=Joe Paduda |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119033918/http://www.joepaduda.com/archives/000875.html |archivedate=2011-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bevacizumab]] ([[Avastin]]) has been used against wet age-related [[macular degeneration]], as well as [[macular edema]] from diseases such as [[diabetic retinopathy]] and [[central retinal vein occlusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/medicine/story/0,,1799772,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Drugs firm blocks cheap blindness cure | first=Sarah | last=Boseley | date=2006-06-17 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Buprenorphine#Antidepressant features|Buprenorphine]] has been shown experimentally (1982–1995) to be effective against severe, refractory depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naabt.org/documents/The_Buprenorphine_effect_on_Depression.pdf |title=The Buprenorphine Effect on Depression |publisher=Naabt.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bodkin JA, etal | year = 1995 | title = Buprenorphine Treatment of Refractory Depression | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 49–57 | pmid = 7714228 | doi=10.1097/00004714-199502000-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bupropion]], when sold under the brand name Wellbutrin is indicated for depression. It is also sold as a smoking cessation drug, under the name Zyban. In Ontario, Canada, smoking cessation drugs are not covered by provincial drug plans. Thus, a physician can write a prescription for Wellbutrin to assist with giving up the habit of smoking. Sometimes it is also prescribed as second-line treatment of ADHD, often in combination with the stimulant being used, but it was also shown to work on its own as a [[norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maneeton|first=Narong|last2=Maneeton|first2=Benchalak|last3=Srisurapanont|first3=Manit|last4=Martin|first4=Stephen D.|date=2011-12-01|title=Bupropion for adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=65|issue=7|pages=611–617|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2011.02264.x|issn=1440-1819|pmid=22176279}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also given to counter [[SSRI]]s' negative effects on the [[libido]], anorgasmia and anhedonia.
* [[Carbamazepine]], or Tegretol, has been used as a [[mood stabilizer]] and is accepted treatment for [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeheymd.com/charts/dep4_1.html |title=Mood Stabilizers for Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depressive) |publisher=Leeheymd.com |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Colchicine]] (Colcrys) for pericarditis: colchicine is indicated for the treatment and prevention of gout, though it is also generally considered first-line treatment for acute pericarditis, as well as preventing recurrent episodes. Although the exact mechanism of colchicine is not fully understood, its anti-inflammatory effect for pericarditis appears to be related to its ability to inhibit microtubule self-assembly, resulting in decreased leucocyte motility and phagocytosis. Other non-FDA-approved uses include actinic keratosis, amyloidosis, Peyronie's disease, and psoriasis.
* [[Dexamethasone]] and [[Betamethasone]] in [[premature labor]], to enhance pulmonary maturation of the fetus.&lt;ref name=wing&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wing DA, Powers B, Hickok D |title=U.S. Food and Drug Administration Drug Approval: Slow Advances in Obstetric Care in the United States |journal=[[Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (journal)|Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology]] |doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181d53843| volume=115| issue=4| pages=825–33| year=April 2010 |pmid=20308845}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Doxepin]] has been used to treat [[Angiodema]] and severe allergic reactions due to its strong antihistamine properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/140/7/957 |title=PsychiatryOnline &amp;#124; American Journal of Psychiatry &amp;#124; Doxepin as a potent H2 and H2 antihistamine for epigastric distress |publisher=Ajp.psychiatryonline.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gabapentin]], approved for treatment of [[seizures]] and [[postherpetic neuralgia]] in adults, is used off-label for a variety of conditions including [[bipolar disorder]], [[essential tremor]], [[hot flashes]], [[migraine]] prophylaxis, [[neuropathic pain]] syndromes, [[phantom limb]] syndrome, and [[restless leg syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idahodur.isu.edu/leaflets/2004/GABAPENTIN%20EDU%20LEAFLET%202004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809235342/http://idahodur.isu.edu/leaflets/2004/GABAPENTIN%20EDU%20LEAFLET%202004.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Propranolol]] (Inderal) for performance anxiety: propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used for the treatment of hypertension and the prophylaxis of angina pectoris. In 1991, a published study showed that a single dose of propranolol immediately before the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) significantly improved performance in high school students prone to cognitive dysfunction due to test anxiety. In addition to test taking, propranolol has been tested for public speaking, performing surgery, musical recitals, and sports, all with varying degrees of benefit. Other off-label uses for propranolol include the treatment of thyroid storm, portal hypertension, and neuroleptic-induced akathisia.
* [[Magnesium sulfate]] is used in obstetrics for [[premature labor]] and [[preeclampsia]].&lt;ref name=wing/&gt;
* [[Methotrexate]] (MTX), approved for the treatment of [[choriocarcinoma]], is frequently used for the medical treatment of an unruptured [[ectopic pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://drugs.nmihi.com/whd/pregnancy.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007115832/http://drugs.nmihi.com/whd/pregnancy.html|date=October 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no FDA-approved drug for this purpose and there is little incentive to sponsor an unpatented drug such as MTX for FDA-approval.
*[[Misoprostol]] is approved for medical abortion regimens when administered at the office, but clinicians often give abortion patients the drug to be taken at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gold, Marji|author2=Chong, Erica|title=If we can do it for misoprostol, why not for mifepristone?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''Making Sense of Abstinence''' is a collection of 16 lessons for teaching about [[sexual abstinence]] in the context of comprehensive [[sexuality education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getthefactsny.org/educators/documents/NewMakingSenseFlyer.pdf|title=Empire State Acts|website=Getthefactsny.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy, Prevention, and Parenting, it is "a [[curriculum]] that takes [[abstinence]] beyond a one-dimensional scope of 'just say no,'...[utilizing] positive and engaging activities to help young people think about [[abstinence]] in a way that values their ability to make decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moappp.org/Documents/MakingSenseAbstinence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Making Sense of Abstinence : Lessons for Comprehensive Sexuality Education|website=Moappp.org|date=February 8, 2006|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample lessons include such titles as "So What's An Abstinence Anyway?" "Hey, Mom?  Hey, Dad? Hey...Gram?  Can We Talk about Abstinence?" "Just Say Know," "Masturbation:  A Touchy Subject," "Handling Horny," and "Some Day:  Making the Transition from Sexual Abstinence".

The manual has received praise from sexuality educators for expanding the way [[sexuality education]] teaches about abstinence, and for teaching the subject in a positive way, unlike other fear-based approaches.  For example, the online journal "Sexual Intelligence" praised "Making Sense of Abstinence" for "not treating kids like robotic idiots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualintelligence.org/newsletters/issue71.html#four|title=Sexual Intelligence by Marty Klein, Ph.D.|website=Sexualintelligence.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abstinence-only]] advocates have criticized the manual for including such topics as [[outercourse]] and [[masturbation]], behaviors they believe should not be acknowledged.  Critics also claim that teenagers should not learn information to protect themselves when their abstinence decisions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedom.us/pdf/abstinence_ed.pdf|format=PDF|title=Faith and Freedom|website=Faithandfreedom.us|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of "Making Sense of Abstinence" state that neither the "Just say no" approach, nor the "Always say yes," is appropriate for abstinence education.  Rather, they emphasize that teens need complete information to help them make the best decisions for themselves.

'''Muqaddam''' is an Arabic title, adopted in other Islamic cultures, for any of various civil or religious officials. The literal meaning is something like "expediter", "facilitator", or "assistant".

* in the [[Tijaniyyah]], [[Shadhiliyyah]], and other [[Sufism|Sufi orders]], a '''muqaddam''' is a student of the Sufi path (a [[murid]] or [[dervish]]) who has been authorized by his/her Guide (''aka'' [[shaikh]], [[Pir (Sufism)|pir]], or [[murshid]]) to assist in teaching the path to other students.
* in Bengal, the '''muqaddam''' (in some places he was called '''mukhiya''') was the village headman, through whom the government dealt with the peasants. 
* As per the Persian documents of medieval India, a '''muqaddam''' was the headman of a village. He was, by profession, a peasant of the village which he headed. He could sell and buy land for the village and settle the common treasury. His position was hereditary; however, it could also be bought and sold. He was never a government servant, but he could be dispossessed of his status by the revenue official.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irfan Habib|Habib, Irfan]]: The Agrarian System of Mughal India, Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-565595-8}}, pp. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt;
* in Mount [[Lebanon]], the '''Muqaddams''' were the secular leaders of their religious community. The last Muqaddams disappeared in the beginning of the 16th Century.
* in the militaries (generally ground forces and sometimes air forces) of several Arab nations, '''Muqaddam''' is equivalent to the Anglophone rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Army officer ranks]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 The cows meat near by to chest is also called Muqaddam ka Ghost. Bade Mazee ka rehta.

{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}
{{Family law}}
A '''parenting plan''' is a child custody plan that is negotiated by parents, and which may be included in a marital separation agreement or final decree of divorce.&lt;ref name="relationshipspp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parenting plans|url=http://www.familyrelationships.gov.au/BrochuresandPublications/Pages/parenting-plans.aspx|website=Family Relationships Online|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Parenting Plan?|url=http://www.jud6.org/ContactInformation/familyLaw/ParentingPlanFlyerSept08.pdf|website=Sixth Judicial Circuit of Florida|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially when a separation is acrimonious to begin with, specific agreements about who will discharge these responsibilities and when and how they are to be discharged can reduce the need for litigation. Avoiding litigation spares parties not only the financial and emotional costs of litigation but the uncertainty of how favorable or unfavorable a court's after-the-fact decision will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haet|first1=Tamarah|title=California Child Custody Litigation and Practice|date=2017|publisher=CEB|isbn=0762625279|page=416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qLcDgAAQBAJ|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the agreement itself can authorize the employment of dispute-resolution methods, such as arbitration and mediation, that may be less costly than litigation.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=RCW 26.09.184. Permanent parenting plan.|url=http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.09.184|website=Revised Code of Washington|publisher=Washington State Legislature|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting a parenting plan==
A well-drafted parenting plan addresses both the custodial rights and responsibilities of parents who share custody of a minor child or children, and the logistical and other procedures for carrying out its substantive requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parenting Plan Checklist|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/parent/ppc-lvppp/index.html|website=Department of Justice|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can agree to a plan that takes into consideration their children's ages and needs and, if they continue to co-parent effectively, can adjust their plans over time to ensure that their plan remains in the best interest of their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Custody, Parenting Time and Child Development|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/child_custody/child-up_parenting.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidelines===
Some jurisdictions have guidelines, either default rules&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|last1=Jolly|first1=Sherry B.|last2=Roper|first2=J. David|last3=Craig|first3=Daniel J.|title=Parenting Plans &amp; Revised Child Support Addendum|url=http://www.augustabar.org/Resources/459.pdf|website=Augusta Bar Association|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''i.e.'', rules that apply only in the absence of provisions to the contrary) or hard-and-fast requirements to which all agreements must adhere,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Revised Protocol for Family Law Cases|url=http://www.co.champaign.il.us/CircuitCourt/PDFS/Family_Law/2017FamilyLawProtocol.pdf|website=Circuit Court|publisher=Champaign County, Illinois|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the content of parenting plans. Moreover, courts in some communities offer proposed templates whose terms take into account community-specific factors such as availability of day-care services, school-bus routes and schedules, and schedules of school and community athletics and other activities.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A journal of the [[American Psychological Association]] published an article, endorsed by 110 researchers and practitioners including prominent international authorities on early child development and divorce, featuring recommendations for parenting plans for children under four years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Warshak|Warshak, R. A.]], with the endorsement of 110 researchers and practitioners. (2014). [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/law/20/1/46/%5D Social Science and Parenting Plans for Young Children: A Consensus Report]. [[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]], ''20, (1)'', 46-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
Topics addressed in a parenting plan may include, but are not limited to:

*Physical custody (how the child's time is to be divided between the separating parents and their separate households; a well-drafted plan will specifically contemplate holidays and school vacations)
:*Transferring the child from one parent to the other: schedule, method, and location
:*Departures from the typical custody schedule (''e.g.'', overnight stays with the other parent or with other relatives during a given parent's normal custody time)
:*Restrictions, as needed, on places visited and/or persons associated with while the child is present
*Legal custody (decision-making authority and rights to information)
:*Authority over physical and mental health-care decisions; access to health records
:*Authority to change the place at which a child resides while in the physical custody of a given parent
:*Authority over educational decisions such as where the child attends school; access to educational records
:*Authority to take the child on travel, especially travel outside the geographic jurisdiction of the court adjudicating the separation or divorce
:*Authority to claim the child as a dependent for income-tax purposes
*Financial support obligations:
:*Provision for basic needs
:*Payment for education
:*Payment of health-insurance premiums and other medical expenses
:*Inclusion of the other parent and/or the child in a given parent's estate planning, including both the probate process (disposition of assets by will) and procedures outside of probate (payout of life-insurance policies, distribution of survivor benefits, etc.)
*Communication between parents:
:*Obligation to keep the other parent apprised of contact information both of a given parent and of the child while with that parent
:*Right of the other parent to information about circumstances and events affecting the child's well-being
*Procedures for resolving disputes, including but not limited to disputes about the meaning of the plan's language and disputes alleging improper performance of the plan's provisions
:*Provisions, if desired, for [[alternative dispute resolution]] such as [[arbitration]] and [[mediation]]

In some cases, parenting plans may be established through the combined effect of multiple agreements each addressing a different subject. For example, one agreement may address physical custody while another addresses financial support.

===Entry by a court===
A parenting plan agreed upon by the parties in an out-of-court setting is often termed "endorsed", "stipulated" or "on consent."&lt;ref name="aucourts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Lester|title=Mandatory mediation: A rose by any other name|journal=Conflict Resolution Quarterly|date=September 1991|volume=9|issue=1|pages=33–46|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/crq.3900090105/full|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge who finds a stipulated parenting plan to be consistent with the child's best interest may be able approve the plan without requiring the parties or the child to be present in court, sparing the parents inconvenience and the child the emotional stress of dealing with authority figures in an unfamiliar setting.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Australia ==
Parenting Plans in [[Australia]]&lt;ref name="relationshipspp"/&gt; are a written agreement between two parents and are made without the assistance or endorsement of a court,&lt;ref name="aucourts"&gt;{{cite web|title=If you agree on parenting arrangements|url=http://www.familycourt.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/fcoaweb/family-law-matters/parenting/if-you-agree-on-arrangements/|website=Family Court of Australia|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can be made with the assistance of a mediator. Parenting plans can include as many or as few considerations about the child or children as both parents agree to. However child support payments are not generally included as payable child support is calculated by the Australian Government Child Support Agency (CSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.gov.au|title=Australian Government Child Support Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parenting plans are non-binding and not legally enforceable but may be written in such a way that they can submitted to a court for endorsement.&lt;ref name="aucourts"/&gt; Once endorsed the parenting plan becomes a biding consent order.&lt;ref name="aucourts"/&gt; Even if not endorsed by a court so as to be legally enforceable, if legal action is initiated after a parenting plan has been agreed between the parents, the court will give careful consideration and considerable weight to the agreed plan as it shows the intent of each parent at the time of signing.

There is no such thing as a "standard" parenting plan as each one is unique, but unofficial example parenting plans are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Share the Care Parenting Plan|url=https://www.relationships.org.au/relationship-advice/publications/pdfs/share-the-care-parenting-plan|website=Relationships Australia, Inc.|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Belgium &amp; the Netherlands ==
The parental plan is introduced in the legislation in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;See the Dutch Civil Code - Book 1, Law of Person and Family Law, [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-iOqOKLc35PelNsaTZKeGN6Y0E/edit Title 1.14 Authority over children]&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a law project in Belgium&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dekamer.be/FLWB/PDF/53/2595/53K2595001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to introduce it is, as well.

== Great Britain ==
In [[England]] and [[Wales]] the [[Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service]], a [[non-departmental public body]], produces a booklet ''Parenting Plans Putting your children first: a guide for separating parents''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parenting Plans: Putting your children first: a guide for separating parents|url=http://www.multicompare.com.au/guide-for-separating-parents/|website=Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070506105755/http://dfes.gov.uk/childrensneeds/|archivedate=6 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Romania ==
Upon the introduction of the joint-custody in the national legislation in Romania, a standard parenting plan was released with the public. Parental plans appeared for the first time with the mediation law&lt;ref&gt;What is mediation law [http://www.dreptonline.ro/legislatie/lege_mediere_profesia_mediator_192_2006.php here]&lt;/ref&gt;, which provided in Articles 2 and 64 that parents may be mediated about how to raise children after divorce. Thus, although in Romania, in 2006-2011, only the notion of single custody was actually applicable in fact through mediation agreements, mediators have implemented legal arrangements for [[Joint custody|joint legal custody]].&lt;ref&gt;See also this article, [https://www.juridice.ro/257270/mediere-pentru-negocierea-planului-parental.html] in Romanian.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was adapted to the specific of Romania and it is now being used by the mediators across the county. Due to the introduction (as of October 2011) of the joint parental authority, the notion of parental plan has legal support through, Article 506 of the new Civil Code. There is a proposal of non-governmental associations to implement the parental plan in tertiary legislation (implementation guide under the aegis of authorized institutions), but also to introduce this plan into primary legislation (these are amendments to Law 272/2004 initiated by the DGPC).

In the [[United States|United States of America]], many{{which|date=November 2016}} [[Federalism in the United States|state courts]] require that separating or divorcing couples who have children include a parenting plan among the terms of their separation agreement and/or their eventual divorce decree. Separated or unmarried parents may enter into a parenting plan of their own creation without going to court, but that plan won't be enforceable in court.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g, {{cite web|title=Co-Parenting Guide|url=https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/cs/coparenting.pdf|website=Office of the Attorney General of Texas|accessdate=3 October 2017}} (Discussing informal parenting plans).&lt;/ref&gt;

Parenting plans are usually initiated as part of a divorce decree or custody case between unmarried parents.  Divorced parents whose child custody is governed by a parenting plan can request that a court amend the plan or replace it with a new one.  In jurisdictions whose laws permit the practice, some plans permit the parties to amend certain provisions, such as those specifying where a parent will live during that parent's time with the child, by agreement without court approval.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

A court reviewing a petition for amendment or replacement of a court-ordered parenting plan will employ the "child's best interest" standard in light of circumstances or changes in circumstances such as a parent's relocation, the presence or absence of [[child abuse]] in one or both parents' households, and health problems of a parent or the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abramowicz|first1=Sarah|title=Contractualizing Custody|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=2014|volume=83|page=67|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/flr83&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the parents in a custody dispute request, many states allow children who are old enough to state an informed preference, to testify about their own preferences as to custody and parenting time, with their opinion taken into consideration by the court along with all other evidence relating to their best interest.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=The "Best Interests of the Child" Factors|url=https://michiganlegalhelp.org/self-help-tools/family/best-interests-of-child-factors|website=Michigan Legal Help|accessdate=3 October 2017}}, {{cite web|title=Best Interests of the Child|url=http://www.nycbar.org/get-legal-help/article/family-law/child-custody-and-parenting-plans/best-interests-of-the-child/|website=New York City Bar|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The weight assigned by the court to a child's testimony will vary with factors such as the child's intellectual and psychological maturity, for which the child's age is often used as a proxy; the child's level of insight into his or her situation; and the credibility of the child's testimony as affected by factors ranging from the child's level of honesty to any undue influence on the child by either or both parents.

Most states require that court-ordered parenting plans set forth the minimum amount of parenting time and access to which a noncustodial parent is entitled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/107.102|title=Oregon 107.102 Parenting plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circuitclerk.nashville.gov/circuit/forms/formcir_8_pprequirements.pdf|title=Tennessee, Minimum parenting plan requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiacourts.org/forms/Parenting%20PlanForm_08.pdf|title=Georgia parenting plan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006000351/http://www.georgiacourts.org/forms/Parenting%20PlanForm_08.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jud14.flcourts.org/CountyPrograms/FamilyLaw/Brochures/Parenting%20Plan%20Brochure.pdf|title=Florida Parenting Plan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314110745/http://www.jud14.flcourts.org/CountyPrograms/FamilyLaw/Brochures/Parenting%20Plan%20Brochure.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/family/custody/parenting/inplan.htm|title=California Parenting Plans}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these states, an agreement's failure to specify the non-custodial parent's minimum level of access can constitute grounds for appeal of the adjudicating court's approval of the plan.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  In cases where separated or divorced parents live near each other, most U.S. states' [[family court]]s follow a [[default rule]] of granting the non-custodial parent the right of visitation on every second weekend and some holidays.

'''Police corruption in [[Mexico]]''' is currently one of the greatest challenges facing Mexican law enforcement agencies and politicians. Corruption has a long-standing role in Mexican history and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.transparency.org/content/download/1856/12434/file/2014_CPIBrochure_EN.pdf Corruption Perceptions Index 2014] [[Transparency International]], PDF, Retrieved March 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Corruption==
[[Corruption in Mexico]] has its roots in colonial times. With the arrival of conquistadors, the Spanish crown began assigning offices of power to certain wealthy and influential people {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. These offices were often short-lived because officials were charged with collecting revenue, maintaining order, and sustaining their regions while relying on only local sources of wealth and sustenance. At the same time, corruption in the church became widespread {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, with people of power and money purchasing positions of influence within the church. People began to learn how to manipulate their local political and religious leaders. They would hold fiestas to gain favor with church officials who could protect them from landowners or officials while political leaders were bribed so that they would protect the people from the church. This system of bribery and purchasing one's way into power and influence continued into post-colonial times, where the Mexican society organized itself into a pyramid-like hierarchy with the rich and powerful at the top {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. After independence, corruption was used not only as a means of advancement but also as a means to provide goods and services {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. In this way, corruption became a method for lowly-paid bureaucrats to raise revenue in order to boost infrastructural and social projects as well as supplement incomes.

==Causes of Corruption in Mexico==

===Social Advancement and Economic Survival===
Corruption exists as a means to either boost ones standing in the local community or to supplement the extremely low incomes that most of the Mexican population receive. Many Mexican officials use corruption to either boost their social influence or to boost their income{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Corruption is also caused by a desire to manipulate and influence other people. 

===Fear, Organized Crime, and Drugs===
One of the main causes of corruption in Mexico is the prevalence of drug-trafficking criminals who bribe police and official to either overlook law-breaking or to use their positions of authority to actively assist in criminal activity.

==Corruption in the Police==
Corruption in the Mexican police can take many forms. It ranges from taking bribes to ignore crimes to active participation in criminal activity such as extortion, drug-trafficking, and assassination. The Mexican police are notorious for their corruption that is evident on all levels of law-enforcement, local and federal. Many Mexican police officers enter law-enforcement not because of a genuine interest in policing but because of ulterior motives. Some join to escape criminal pasts in other states, others join to earn some money before moving onto other business ventures, while others join to increase their criminal networks, allowing them to boost drug and crime spread, connections, and distribution.

==Effects of Police Corruption==
There are several resulting effects of the blatant and widespread police corruption. Over 90% of crimes go unreported or are not investigated{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Many Mexican citizens do not feel safe and protected by the police tasked with their safety and protection{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. 43% of Mexican citizens believe that corruption is the main obstacle facing successful law-enforcement{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Many people have reported bribing the police, even for minor incidents such as illegal parking and other traffic violations{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Mexico's business officials have noted that police corruption has had a severely negative influence on business and economic progress{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Police corruption is also in part to blame for the widely accepted failure of the war on drugs and the continued spread of illicit narcotics and the growth of the drug-manufacturing and distribution industries{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

==Efforts to Stop Corruption==
The Mexican government has taken many steps to combat corruption, some efforts including international aid, mostly from the United States. As a tourist, not carrying large amounts of cash and refusing to pay bribes can help to stop police corruption. If in doubt, ask to see the written law violation in the police station.

The '''Polish minority in the Republic of Ireland''' numbered approximately 122,515 (2.57% of the population) according to 2016 census figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/population/2017/Chapter_5_Diversity.pdf Census 2016 ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420234900/http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/population/2017/Chapter_5_Diversity.pdf |date=April 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Poland]] joined the [[European Union]] in May 2004, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] was one of just three existing EU members to open its borders and welcome Polish workers (the others being the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Sweden]]). Ireland quickly became a key destination for Poles wishing to work outside the country; in 2004 a website advertising Irish jobs in [[Polish language|Polish]] received over 170,000 hits in its first day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0519/internet-business.html|title=New Irish jobsite a hit in Poland|date=19 May 2004|work=RTÉ.ie|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2007 [[Polish parliamentary election, 2007|Polish general election]], Polish parties campaigned in Ireland and three voting locations were set up; in Dublin, [[Cork (city)|Cork]], and [[Limerick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0930/poland.html|title=Polish opposition party campaigns in Ireland|date=30 September 2007|work=RTÉ.ie|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|2008 economic downturn]], the number of Polish people in Ireland has declined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1015464.shtml|title=Up to 1,300 Polish people leaving Ireland every week|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some reports suggesting that 30,000 were leaving Ireland per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/poles-flee-ailing-irish-economy-1511401.html|title=Poles flee ailing Irish economy|work=Independent.ie|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] reporting a decrease in the number of Polish people applying for [[Personal Public Service Number|PPS numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/labour_market/current/ppsn.pdf CSO - Foreign Nationals: PPSN Allocations, Employment and Social Welfare Activity - 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish, although not officially an established subject, can be taken as part of the Irish [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] examination as is the case with all official languages of the European Union. The exam used is based on the paper of the [[European Baccalaureate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&amp;mc=ex&amp;sc=eu|title=State Examination Commission - Examination Information|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest Polish umbrella organization is Polish Educational Society in Ireland (PESI)  established in 2012. PESI embraces Polish supplementary schools in Ireland and widely cooperates with Polish government bodies and organisations working for the maintenance and promotion of Polish language abroad. Polish Educational Society in Ireland is a non-profit organisation, an independent NGO  - limited company registered with CRO (525504).http://www.polskamacierz.com/english.html

The large number of Poles in Ireland led to the provision of a number of media outlets catering to them. Newspapers: "Nasz  Glos" The Free Polish Weekly distributed across Ireland [http://www.ng24.ie ng24.ie], ''Polska Gazeta''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskagazeta.ie|title=Polska Gazeta - NAJWIĘKSZY POLSKI TYGODNIK W IRLANDII OD 2005 ROKU|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a section in Dublin's [[Evening Herald]] entitled "''Polski'' Herald". Dublin cable television channel, [[City Channel (Dublin)|City Channel]], also features a programme aimed at Poles in Ireland entitled Oto Polska (This is Poland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://networkeurope.radio.cz/feature/polish-language-tv-helping-irelands-fastest-growing-immigrant-group-feel-at-home|title=Polish language TV helping Ireland’s fastest growing immigrant group feel at home|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Prevention of Corruption Act 1906''' (6 Edw.7 c.34) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (as it was then). It is one of the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 1916.

Section 1 makes it an offence (formerly classified as a misdemeanour) subject to imprisonment up to 7 years:
* for an agent to obtain a consideration as an inducement or reward for doing any act, or showing favour or disfavour to any person, in relation to his principal's affairs.  
* for any person to give a consideration to an agent to induce him to do an act in relation to his principal's affairs.  
* for any person or agent to knowingly falsify receipts, accounts or other documents with the intent to deceive the principal.

==Agent and principal==

An "agent" includes any person employed by or acting for another, and a "principal" includes an employer.&lt;ref&gt;The Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, section 1(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

The "principal" is the person the agent is employed by or acting for.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

Anyone working for the government counts as an agent. (s.1(3)) 

In 2002, [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001#Part 12 (Bribery and corruption)|Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] extended this law for England, Wales and Northern Ireland internationally so that it could be exercised in cases where the agent and the principal had no connection with the UK. An equivalent change was made for Scotland by the [[Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003]]. 

A prosecution in England and Wales for an offence under this Act cannot be instituted without the consent of the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]],&lt;ref&gt;The Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, section 2(1)&lt;/ref&gt; who can discontinue an investigation that is working towards a prosecution under the Act.

'''Raute''' are a [[nomad]]ic indigenous ethnic group officially recognized by the [[Government of Nepal]]. They are known for subsistence hunting of [[langur]] and [[macaque]] monkeys. They gather wild forest [[tuber]]s, fruits, and greens on a regular basis. To obtain grain, iron, cloth, and jewelry, they carve wooden bowls and boxes to trade for goods from local farmers. They do not sell other forest products, [[bushmeat]], or forest medicinal plants.

Their population is estimated at about 650 people living in small settlements in the regions of western Nepal. Most have been forcibly settled by the government of Nepal but there are about 150 nomadic Raute.

The Raute language is called "Raute" in most studies and sometimes "Khamci," meaning "our talk" in a few other studies. It is closely related to the language spoken by two related ethnic groups, the Ban Raji ("Little Rulers of the Forest") and Raji ("Little Rulers") of the same region (Fortier and Rastogi 2004). The closest well-documented language to Raute known at the present time is [[Nepali language|Nepalese]] spoken by an ethnic group of west-central Nepal who also have been [[hunter-gatherer]]s until the current generation.

Rautes emphasize that they wish to remain full-time foragers and not assimilate into the surrounding farming population.

==Founding Principles==

The Raute people emphasize that their continued existence is based on three principles:
* Remain nomadic.
* Continue their own native culture, language, and education.
* Remain hunter-gatherers

'''Social entrepreneurship''' is the use of [[Startup company|start-up companies]] and other [[entrepreneur]]s to develop, fund and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/now/enterprisingideas/what-is.html ''Enterprising Ideas''], What is a Social Entrepreneur, PBS Foundation &lt;/ref&gt; This concept may be applied to a variety of organizations with different sizes, aims, and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;"The Meaning of Social Entrepreneurship," J. Gregory Dees, 1998, rev 2001 {{cite web | publisher=caseatduke.org | title=The Meaning of Social Entrepreneurship | url=http://caseatduke.org/ | accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For-profit entrepreneurs typically measure performance using business metrics like [[Profit (economics)|profit]], [[revenues]] and increases in [[stock price]]s, but social entrepreneurs are either [[non-profit organization|non-profits]] or blend for-profit goals with generating a positive "return to society" and therefore must use different metrics. Social entrepreneurship typically attempts to further broad social, cultural, and environmental goals often associated with the [[voluntary sector]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = J.L. | year = 2002 | title = The World of the Social Entrepreneur | url = | journal = The International Journal of Public Sector Management | volume = 15 | issue = 4/5| page = 413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in areas such as poverty alleviation, [[health care]] and [[community development]].

At times, profit-making [[social enterprise]]s may be established to support the social or cultural goals of the organization but not as an end in itself. For example, an organization that aims to provide housing and employment to the [[homelessness|homeless]] may operate a [[restaurant]], both to raise money and to provide employment for the homeless.

In the 2010s, social entrepreneurship is facilitated by the use of the [[Internet]], particularly [[social networking]] and [[social media]] websites. These [[website]]s enable social entrepreneurs to reach a large number of people who are not geographically close yet who share the same goals and encourage them to [[collaboration|collaborate]] online, learn about the issues, disseminate information about the group's events and activities, and raise funds through [[crowdfunding]].

== Modern definition ==
[[File:Yunus Social entrepreneurs Sanwar Uddin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Grameen Bank]] founder and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Muhammad Yunus]] (left) with two young social entrepreneurs (right).]] 
In the 2000s, scholars and practitioners have debated which individuals or organizations can be considered to be social entrepreneurs. Thus far, there has been no firm consensus on the definition of social entrepreneurship, as so many different fields, disciplines and organization types are associated with social entrepreneurship, ranging from for-profit businesses to hybrid models combining charitable work with business activities, to non-profit charities, voluntary sector organizations and non-governmental organizations. Philanthropists, social activists, environmentalists, and other socially-oriented practitioners are often referred to as social entrepreneurs. Social entrepreneurs can include a range of career types and professional backgrounds, ranging from [[social work]] and [[community development]] to [[entrepreneurship]] and [[environmental science]]. For this reason, it is difficult to determine who is a social entrepreneur. [[David Bornstein (author)|David Bornstein]] has even used the term "social innovator" interchangeably with social entrepreneur, due to the creative, non-traditional strategies that many social entrepreneurs use.&lt;ref&gt;David Bornstein, "''How to Change the World''" (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 1, 92&lt;/ref&gt; For a clearer definition of what social entrepreneurship entails, it is necessary to set the function of social entrepreneurship apart from other voluntary sector and charity-oriented activities and identify the boundaries within which social entrepreneurs operate.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Saifan, S. 2012. [http://www.timreview.ca/article/523 Social Entrepreneurship: Definition and Boundaries]. [http://www.timreview.ca/ Technology Innovation Management Review]. [http://www.timreview.ca/issue/2012/february February 2012]: 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have advocated restricting the term to founders of organizations that primarily rely on earned income (meaning income earned directly from paying consumers), rather than income from donations or grants. Others have extended this to include contracted work for public authorities, while still others include grants and donations.

Social entrepreneurship in modern society offers an altruistic form of entrepreneurship that focuses on the benefits that society may reap.&lt;ref name="Wee" /&gt; Simply put, entrepreneurship becomes a social endeavor when it transforms [[social capital]] in a way that affects society positively.&lt;ref name="Alvord"&gt;Alvord, Sarah H., Brown, David L., and Letts, Christine W. "Social Entrepreneurship and Societal Transformation: An Exploratory Study." The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science. no. 3 (2004): 260-282.&lt;/ref&gt; It is viewed as advantageous because the success of social entrepreneurship depends on many factors related to social impact that traditional corporate businesses do not prioritize. Social entrepreneurs recognize immediate social problems, but also seek to understand the broader context of an issue that crosses disciplines, fields, and theories.&lt;ref name="Alvord" /&gt; Gaining a larger understanding of how an issue relates to society allows social entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions and mobilize available resources to affect the greater global society. Unlike traditional corporate businesses, social entrepreneurship ventures focus on maximizing gains in social satisfaction, rather than maximizing profit gains.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;Baron, David P. "Corporate Social Responsibility and Social Entrepreneurship." Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy. no. 3 (2007): 683-717.&lt;/ref&gt; Both private and public agencies worldwide have had billion-dollar initiatives to empower deprived communities and individuals.&lt;ref name="Alvord" /&gt; Such support from organizations in society, such as government-aid agencies or private firms, may catalyze innovative ideas to reach a larger audience.

Prominent individuals associated with social entrepreneurship include Pakistani [[Akhter Hameed Khan]] and Bangladeshi [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]], a leader of [[social entrepreneurship in South Asia]]. Yunus was the founder of [[Grameen Bank]], which pioneered the concept of [[microcredit]] for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He received a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Others, such as former [[Indianapolis]] mayor [[Stephen Goldsmith]] addressed social efforts on a local level by using the private sector to provide city services.&lt;ref name="economist810"&gt;{{cite news

==Characteristics ==
Bill Drayton founded Ashoka in 1980, an organization which supports local social entrepreneurs. Drayton tells his employees to look for four qualities: creativity, entrepreneurial quality, social impact of the idea, and ethical fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has two parts: goal-setting and problem-solving. Social entrepreneurs are creative enough to have a vision of what they want to happen and how to make that vision happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book The Power of Unreasonable People John Elkington and Pamela Hartigan identify why social entrepreneurs are, as they put it, unreasonable. They argue that these men and women seek profit in social output where others would not expect profit. They also ignore evidence suggesting that their enterprises will fail and attempt to measure results which no one is equipped to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elkington|first1=John|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|date=2008|publisher=Harvard Business Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4221-0406-4|pages=15–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; About this, the Schwab Foundation says that entrepreneurs have, "A zeal to measure and monitor their impact. Entrepreneurs have high standards, particularly in relation to their own organization's efforts and in response to the communities with which they engage. Data, both quantitative and qualitative, are their key tools, guiding continuous feedback and improvement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Social Entrepreneur?|url=http://www.schwabfound.org/content/what-social-entrepreneur|website=Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurs|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka operates in multiple countries.

Entrepreneurial quality builds from creativity. Not only do entrepreneurs have an idea that they must implemented, they know how to implement it and are realistic in the vision of implementing it. Drayton says that, "Entrepreneurs have in their heads the vision of how society will be different when their idea is at work, and they can't stop until that idea is not only at work in one place, but is at work across the whole society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=124–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; This manifests through a clear idea of what they believe the future will look like and a drive to make this come true. Besides this, entrepreneurs are not happy with the status quo; they want healthy change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elkington|first1=John|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|date=2008|publisher=Harvard Business Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4221-0406-4|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changemaking process has been described as the creation of market disequilibria through the conversion of antagonistic assets into complementarities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hockerts | first1 = K. | year = 2015 | title = How hybrid organizations turn antagonistic assets into complementarities | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1525/cmr.2015.57.3.83 | journal = California Management review | volume = 57 | issue = 3| page = 83-106. }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Komatsu | first1 = T. | year = 2016 | title =Social Innovation Business Models: Coping with Antagonistic Objectives and Assets| url = https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/S2043-905920160000011013 | journal = Finance and Economy for Society: Integrating Sustainability | page = 315-347. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social impact measures whether the idea itself will be able to cause change after the original founder is gone. If an idea has intrinsic worth, once implemented it will cause change even without the charismatic leadership of the first entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason that these entrepreneurs are unreasonable is that they are unqualified for the task they take on. Most entrepreneurs have not studied the skills needed to implement their ideas. Instead, they bring a team of qualified people around themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elkington|first1=John|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|date=2008|publisher=Harvard Business Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4221-0406-4|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the idea that draws this team.

Ethical fiber is important because leaders who are about to change the world must be trustworthy. Drayton described this to his employees by suggesting that they picture a situation that frightens them and then place the candidate in the situation with them. If they feel comfortable in this scenario, the entrepreneur has ethical fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; One distinguishing attribute of entrepreneurs is that they rarely take credit for making change. They insist that the change they have brought about is due to everyone around them. They also tend to be driven by emotion; they are not trying primarily to make a profit but to address suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elkington|first1=John|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|date=2008|publisher=Harvard Business Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4221-0406-4|pages=12, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad Yunus says about this characteristic, "He (or she) competes in the marketplace with all other competitors but is inspired by a set of social objectives. This is the basic reason for being in the business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yunus|first1=Muhhamad|title=Banker to the Poor|date=2007|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586481988|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Because the world of social entrepreneurship is relatively new, there are many challenges facing those who delve into the field. First, social entrepreneurs are trying to predict, address, and creatively respond to future problems.&lt;ref&gt; The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 86 &lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most business entrepreneurs, who address current market deficiencies, social entrepreneurs tackle hypothetical, unseen or often less-researched issues, such as overpopulation, unsustainable energy sources, food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; pp. 86-115&lt;/ref&gt; Founding successful social businesses on merely potential solutions can be nearly impossible as investors are much less willing to support risky ventures.

The lack of eager investors leads to the second problem in social entrepreneurship: the pay gap. Elkington and Hartigan note that “the salary gap between commercial and social enterprises… remains the elephant in the room, curtailing the capacity of [social enterprises] to achieve long-term success and viability.”&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Social entrepreneurs and their employees are often given diminutive or non-existent salaries, especially at the onset of their ventures. Thus, their enterprises struggle to maintain qualified, committed employees. Though social entrepreneurs are tackling the world’s most pressing issues, they must also confront skepticism and stinginess from the very society they seek to serve.&lt;ref&gt; The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason social entrepreneurs are often unsuccessful is because they typically offer help to those least able to pay for it. Capitalism is founded upon the exchange of capital (most obviously, money) for goods and services. However, social entrepreneurs must find new business models that don’t rely on standard exchange of capital in order to make their organizations sustainable. &lt;ref&gt;The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; This self-sustainability is what distinguishes social businesses from charities, who rely almost entirely on donations and outside funding. &lt;ref&gt;The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; pp. 31-&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Social entrepreneurship is distinct from the concept of entrepreneurship, yet still shares several similarities with its business cousin. [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] (1767–1832), a French economist, defined an entrepreneur as a person who "undertakes" an idea and shifts perspectives in a way that it alters the effect that an idea has on society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Osberg | first2 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Social entrepreneurship: The case for definition | url = | journal = Stanford social innovation review | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 28–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An entrepreneur is further defined by Say as someone who "shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield."&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Drucker, ''Innovation and Entrepreneurship'' (New York: Harper Business, 1993), 21&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between "entrepreneurship" and "social entrepreneurship", however, stems from the purpose of a creation. Social entrepreneurs seek to transform societies at large, rather than transforming their [[profit margin]], as classic entrepreneurs typically seek to do. Social entrepreneurs use a variety of resources to bring societies into a better state of well-being.

The concept of "social entrepreneurship" is not a novel idea, but in the 2000s, it has become more popular among society and academic research, notably after the publication of "The Rise of the Social Entrepreneur" by [[Charles Leadbeater]].&lt;ref name="Wee"&gt;Wee-Liang, Williams, John, and Tan, Teck-Meng. "Defining the ‘Social’ in ‘Social Entrepreneurship’: Altruism and Entrepreneurship." The International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal. no. 3 (2005): 353-365.&lt;/ref&gt; Many activities related to community development and higher social purpose fall within the modern definition of social entrepreneurship. Despite the established definition nowadays, social entrepreneurship remains a difficult concept to define, since it may be manifested in multiple forms.&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;Mair, Johanna, and Marti, Ignasi. "Social entrepreneurship research: A source of explanation, prediction, and delight." Journal of World Business.no. 1 (2006): 36-44.&lt;/ref&gt; A broad definition of the concept allows interdisciplinary research efforts to understand and challenge the notions behind social entrepreneurship. No matter in which sector of society certain organizations are (i.e. corporations or unincorporated associations, societies, associations or [[cooperative]]s), social entrepreneurship focuses on the social impact that an endeavor aims at.&lt;ref name="Wee" /&gt; Whether social entrepreneurship is [[altruistic]] or not is less important than the effect it has on society.

The terms ''social entrepreneur'' and ''social entrepreneurship'' were used first in the literature in 1953 by H. Bowen on his book "Social Responsibilities of the Businessman".&lt;ref&gt;For example, the phrase was used as a description of [[Howard Bowen]], ''Social Responsibilities of the Businessman'', America, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; The terms came into widespread use in the 1980s and 1990s, promoted by [[Bill Drayton]],&lt;ref name="social entreprenuer"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[US News &amp; World Report]] | title=The Social Entrepreneur Bill Drayton| date = 2005-10-31 | url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31drayton.htm | accessdate=2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Leadbeater, and others.&lt;ref&gt;'The Rise of the Social Entrepreneur, Demos, London, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1950s to the 1990s, the politician [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] was a leading promoter of social entrepreneurship and in the 1980s, he was described by Professor [[Daniel Bell]] at Harvard University as the "world's most successful entrepreneur of social enterprises". Young created more than sixty new organizations worldwide, including the [[School for Social Entrepreneurs]] (SSE) which exists in the UK, Australia, and Canada and which supports individuals to realize their potential and to establish, scale, and sustain, social enterprises and [[social business]]es. Another notable British social entrepreneur is [[Andrew Mawson, Baron Mawson|Andrew Mawson]] [[OBE]], who was given a peerage in 2007 because of his [[urban regeneration]] work including the [[Bromley by Bow Centre]] in East London. Although the terms are relatively new, social entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurship may be found throughout history. A list of a few noteworthy people whose work exemplifies the modern definition of "social entrepreneurship" includes [[Florence Nightingale]], founder of the first [[nursing school]] and developer of modern nursing practices; [[Robert Owen]], founder of the [[cooperative]] movement; and [[Vinoba Bhave]], founder of India's [[Bhoodan movement|Land Gift Movement]]. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries some of the most successful social entrepreneurs straddled the civic, governmental, and business worlds. These pioneers promoted new ideas that were taken up by mainstream public services in welfare, schools, and health care.

Groups focused on social entrepreneurship may be divided into several categories: community-based enterprises, socially responsible enterprises, [[social services]] industry professionals, and socio-economic enterprises.&lt;ref name="Wee" /&gt; Community-based enterprises are based on the social ventures aimed at and involving an entire community. These enterprises build on the community's culture and capital (e.g., volunteer resources, financing, in-kind donations, etc.) to empower the enterprise and the community.&lt;ref name="Peredo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peredo | first1 = Ana Maria | last2 = Chrisman | first2 = James J. | year = 2006 | title = Toward a theory of community-based enterprise | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 309–328 | doi=10.5465/amr.2006.20208683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socially responsible enterprises focus on creating [[sustainable development]] through their inside organization acts that focus mostly on creating societal gains for the community.&lt;ref name="Wee" /&gt; Social service industry professionals such as [[social worker]]s and [[public health nurse]]s work in [[social services]], either for a government or a non-profit organization. They aim to expand [[social capital]] for individuals, communities, and organizations. Socio-economic enterprises include corporations that balance earning profits with nonprofit goals, such as seeking social change for communities. Some social entrepreneurship organizations are not enterprises in a business sense; instead, they may be charities, non-profit organizations or voluntary sector organizations.

In addition, there are support organizations dedicated to empowering social entrepreneurs, connecting them with [[mentor]]s, strengthening their enterprise models, and preparing them for [[capital investment]]s. These [[Business incubator|incubators]] and [[Business accelerator|accelerator]] organizations provide office and meeting space (often free), [[mentoring]] and coaching for social enterprise founders and leaders to help them develop their enterprises by improving the effectiveness of their business model, marketing, and strategy. Some accelerator organizations help social entrepreneur leaders to scale up their organization, either by taking it from a local scale to a national scale or from a national scale to a global scale. Some [[entrepreneurship]] support organizations also provide mentoring and coaching to social entrepreneurs.

One well-known [[Social entrepreneurship in South Asia|social entrepreneur from South Asia]] is [[Muhammad Yunus]], who founded the [[Grameen Bank]] in 1976. He is known as the "father of [[microcredit]]," and established the [[microfinance]] movement, which aims to help millions of people rural communities to access small loans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For his work, he was awarded a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="GB Nobel"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] | title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2006 | year = 2006 | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/ | accessdate=2006-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work that Yunus did through Grameen Bank has been described as a major influence on later social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="business-socialventures"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Changemakers | title=Business-Social Ventures Reaching for Major Impact| date = November 2003 | url=http://www.changemakers.net/journal/03november/index.cfm| accessdate=2006-11-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614210056/http://www.changemakers.net/journal/03november/index.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Larger countries in Europe and South America have tended to work more closely with public organizations at both the national and local level.

===Types ===

In ''[[The Power of Unreasonable People]]'', [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]] and [[Pamela Hartigan]] describe social entrepreneurs' business structures as falling under three different models, applicable in different situations and economic climates:
# ''Leveraged non-profit'': This business model leverages financial and other resources in an innovative way to respond to social needs.&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Hybrid non-profit'': This organizational structure can take a variety of forms, but is distinctive because the hybrid non-profit is willing to use profit from some activities to sustain its other operations which have a social or community purpose. Hybrid non-profits are often created to deal with [[government failure]]s or [[market failure]]s, as they generate revenue to sustain the operation without requiring loans, grants, and other forms of traditional funding.&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg.37&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Social business venture'': These models are set up as businesses that are designed to create change through social means. Social business ventures evolved through a lack of funding. Social entrepreneurs in this situation were forced to become for-profit ventures, because loans and [[equity financing]] are hard to get for social businesses.&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a broader range of hybrid profit models, where a conventional business invests some portion of its profits on socially, culturally or environmentally beneficial activities. The term "[[Philanthropreneurship]]" has been applied to this type of activity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Corporate employees can also engage in social entrepreneurship, which may or may not be officially sanctioned by the company. This has been described as [[corporate social entrepreneurship]].&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway, Christine A. ''Corporate Social Entrepreneurship: Integrity Within''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013. pg.135 {{ISBN|978-1-107-44719-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One private foundation has staked the ground of more precise lexicon following the [[Newman's Own]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmansownfoundation.org/|title=Newman's Own Foundation - The Power of Philanthropy to Transform Lives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; model having coined the phrase "Commercial Philanthropy" where commercial businesses are held and operated with all net proceeds going to serve social service needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commercialphilanthropy.com/ Foundation for Commercial Philanthropy, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International presence==
Organizations such as the [[Skoll Foundation]], the [[Omidyar Network]], the [[Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship]], [[Tasamy]], [[Athgo]], [[New Profit Inc.]], [[National Social Entrepreneurship Forum]], [[Echoing Green]], and [[Center for Science, Technology, and Society|the Global Social Benefit Institute]] among others, promote and providing resources to advance the initiatives of social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt; The North American organizations tend to have a strongly individualistic stance focused on a handful of exceptional leaders. For example, The Skoll Foundation, created by [[eBay]]'s first president, [[Jeff Skoll]], makes capacity-building "[[Mezzanine funding|mezzanine level]]" grants to social entrepreneurial organizations that already have reached a certain level of effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 425–431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of technology==
The Internet, [[social networking websites]] and [[social media]] have been pivotal resources for the success and collaboration of many social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;Malecki, E. J. (1997). Technology and economic development: the dynamics of local, regional, and national change. ''University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Historical Research Reference in Entrepreneurship''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, the Internet has become especially useful in disseminating information to a wide range of like-minded supporters in short amounts of time, even if these individuals are geographically dispersed. In addition, the Internet allows for the pooling of design resources using [[open source]] principles. Using [[wiki]] models or [[crowdsourcing]] approaches, for example, a social entrepreneur organization can get hundreds of people from across a country (or from multiple countries) to collaborate on joint online projects (e.g., developing a [[business plan]] or a [[marketing]] strategy for a social entrepreneurship venture). These websites help social entrepreneurs to disseminate their ideas to broader audiences, help with the formation and maintenance of [[business networks|networks of like-minded people]] and help to link up potential investors, donors or volunteers with the organization. This enables social entrepreneurs to achieve their goals with little or no start-up capital and little or no "[[bricks and mortar]]" facilities (e.g., rented office space). For example, the rise of [[open-source appropriate technology]] as a [[sustainable development]] paradigm enables people all over the world to collaborate on solving local problems, just as [[open source software]] development leverages collaboration from software experts from around the world.

==Public opinion==

=== Controversy ===
Many initiatives carried out with social entrepreneurs while innovative, have had problems becoming sustainable and effective initiatives that ultimately were able to branch out and reach the larger society as a whole (versus a small community or group of people). Compromises in social initiatives were developed, which often did not reach large audiences or help larger communities. Since the concept of social entrepreneurship has been popularized in the 2000s, some advocates suggest that there needs to be some standardization of the process in scaling up social endeavors to increase the impact of these ventures across the globe.&lt;ref name="Alvord" /&gt;

Policymakers around the globe may need to learn more about social initiatives, to increase the [[sustainability]], effectiveness, and efficiency of these projects.&lt;ref name=Wee/&gt; Involvement and collaboration between private corporations and government agencies allows for increased support for carrying out social entrepreneurship initiatives, increased accountability on both ends, and increased connections with communities, individuals, or agencies in need. For example, private organizations or nonprofit organizations have tackled [[unemployment]] issues in communities.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;Cook, Beth, Dodds, Chris, and Mitchell, William. "Social Entrepreneurship: False 
Premises and Dangerous Forebodings." The Australian Journal of Social Issues. no. 1 (2003): 57-72.&lt;/ref&gt; One challenge is that in some cases, social entrepreneurs may only propose short-term solutions, or that they are unable to scale up their virtual, online organization to a larger degree to maximize the number of people who are helped.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; Government program are able to tackle large issues; however, there is often little collaboration between governments and social entrepreneurs, which may have limited the effectiveness of social entrepreneurship. This lack of inter-sectoral collaboration may  lead to stagnation, if the motives and goals of social enterprises and of those in policy-making and programs are not aligned.&lt;ref name=Drayton&gt;Drayton, William. "The Citizen Sector: BECOMING AS ENTREPRENEURIAL AND COMPETITIVE AS BUSINESS." ''California management review'' 44, no. 3 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Those in policy-making and the development of delivery of government programs tend to have different priorities than social entrepreneurs, resulting in slow growth and expansion of social initiatives.

Since social entrepreneurship has only started to gain momentum in the 2000s, current social entrepreneurs are encouraging social advocates and activists to develop into innovative social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=Drayton/&gt; Increasing the scope and scale of social entrepreneurship may increase the likelihood of an efficient, sustainable, and effective initiative; although it may also render social entrepreneurship more challenging. Increased participation draws more attention to social entrepreneurship ventures from policymakers and privately owned corporations. The increased involvement from corporations and governments may help to strengthen social entrepreneurship, as it may lead to policy changes and to the development of training programs and [[leadership]] development programs for social entrepreneurs. Simultaneously, research shows that as social entrepreneurs attempt to widen their impact and scale their efforts, external institutions will have a key role to play in their success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sud | first1 = M. | last2 = VanSandt | first2 = C.V. | last3 = Baugous | first3 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Social Entrepreneurship: The Role of Institutions | url = | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 201–216 | doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sophonisba Preston Breckinridge''' (April 1, 1866 &amp;ndash; July 30, 1948) was an [[United States|American]] activist, [[Progressive Era]] social reformer, social scientist and innovator in higher education. She was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in political science and economics then the [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] at the University of Chicago, and she was the first woman to pass the Kentucky bar. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] in 1933 sent her as a delegate to the 7th [[Pan-American Conference]] in Uruguay - making her the first woman to represent the U.S. government at an international conference. She led the process of creating the academic professional discipline and degree for [[social work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hammond|first1=Claire Holton|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Women Economists|date=2000|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham, UK|page=81|chapter=Sophonisba Breckinridge (1866–1948)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Born in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], Sophonisba "Nisba" Preston Breckinridge was a member of the politically active and socially prominent Kentuckian elite, Desha family and [[Breckinridge family]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James C. Klotter|Klotter, James C.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z0fBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA356&amp;ots=9X7x0ucnVv&amp;dq=Issa%20Desha&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky, 1760–1981.''] Lexington, Ky: University Press of Kentucky, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the second child of seven of Issa Desha Breckinridge, the second wife of [[William Breckinridge|Col. William C.P. Breckinridge]], a member of Congress from Kentucky, editor and a lawyer. Her paternal grandfather was the [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] minister [[Robert Jefferson Breckinridge]]; her maternal grandfather was General [[Joseph Desha]], a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] and the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|ninth]] [[Governor of Kentucky|governor]] of [[Kentucky]]. Her great-grandfather was [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], the [[United States Attorney General]]. Her cousin, [[John C. Breckinridge]], was [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States#List of vice presidents|Vice President of the United States]] during [[James Buchanan|James Buchanan's]] presidency, and ran against [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]]. At fourteen, she attended the Kentucky Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College (later called the [[University of Kentucky]]) when it opened to women in 1880. She was not allowed to be degree-seeking, but she studied there for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goan|first1=Melanie Beals|title=Establishing their place in the dynasty: Sophonisba and Mary Breckinridge's Paths to Public Service|journal=The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society|date=2003|volume=101|issue=Winter/Spring|pages=45–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Breckenridge graduated from [[Wellesley College]] in 1888 and worked for two years as a high school teacher in [[Washington, D.C.]], teaching mathematics. She traveled in Europe for the next two years returning to Lexington in 1892 when her mother suddenly died. She studied the legal system in her father's law office and in 1895 became the first woman to be admitted to the Kentucky bar.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Ellen F. ''Academics and Activists: Women Social Scientists and the Impulse for Reform, 1892–1920.'' Ph.D. dissertation, [[Brandeis University]], 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Breckinridge had few clients who would hire a woman lawyer, she left Kentucky to become a secretary to [[Marion Talbot]], the [[Dean of Women]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. She enrolled as a graduate student eventually receiving a Ph.M. degree in 1897, and a Ph.D. in [[political science]] and [[economics]] in 1901 from the University of Chicago. Her thesis for the Ph.M. degree was on "The Administration of Justice in Kentucky," and her Ph.D. in Political Science came in 1903 with her [[dissertation]], "Legal Tender: A Study in English and American Monetary History."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/legaltenderstudy00brecuoft#page/n9/mode/2up ''Legal Tender: A Study in English and American Monetary History''], Chicago, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, she was appointed in 1902 as assistant dean of women of the university, and the next year she was hired as an instructor. In 1904, she became the first woman to graduate from the [[University of Chicago Law School]]. "My record there was not distinguished," she later wrote in her autobiography, "but the faculty and students were kind, and the fact that the law school, like the rest of the University...accepted men and women students on equal terms publicly".&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0306/features/cause-timeline.shtml Legal Actions: A chronology of the University of Chicago Law School]&lt;/ref&gt; She also became the first woman to be admitted to [[Order of the Coif]], an honorary legal scholastic society. A news writer in [[Paris, Kentucky]] announced her achievement and gushed that Breckinridge, "is considered one of the most brilliant women in the South."&lt;ref&gt;[http://kdl.kyvl.org/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=bibview;cc=bibview;idno=bn1904061701;didno=bn1904061701;view=pdf;seq=5 The Bourbon News], Paris, Ky., June 17, 1904, col 3, p. 5.

==Social scientist==
As a social scientist, teaching and conducting research at the University of Chicago, Breckinridge focused on the intersection of the social problems, public policy and social reforms with an emphasis on immigrants, African Americans, child laborers, and working women in American urban centers, among other issues. From the beginning, she took an activist approach and became involved with the [[Women's Trade Union League]] (WTUL), serving as a factory inspector.

In 1907 she joined the [[Hull House]] project and began in earnest to work with the leaders of the Chicago settlement house movement, [[Jane Addams]], [[Mary McDowell]], and [[Margaret Dreier Robins]] on such issues as vocational training, housing, juvenile delinquency and truancy. Breckinridge also collaborated with [[Vassar College]] graduate and social reformer [[Julia Lathrop]], and [[social gospel]] minister [[Graham Taylor]], a founder of the [[settlement house]] ''Chicago Commons'', to create the ''Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy'', becoming its first dean.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy Files, 1903–1922, in the [http://www.newberry.org/collections/findingaids/taylor/taylor.html#series8 Graham Taylor Papers, 1820–1975, bulk 1866–1940], Roger and Julie Baskes Department of Special Collections, [http://www.newberry.org The Newberry Library], Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, Breckinridge and Lathrop had convinced the Board of the School to merge it into the University of Chicago, forming the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100822060108/http://www.ssa.uchicago.edu/aboutssa/schooldesc.shtml Graduate School of Social Service Administration]. By 1927 the faculty of this new academic unit created the scholarly journal ''[[Social Service Review]]'' which remains the premier journal in the field of social work. Breckinridge and [[Edith Abbott]] were the founding editors, and Breckinridge worked on its publication every year until her death in 1948.

By 1909, Breckenridge had become an assistant professor of social economy, and over ten years later, in 1920, she finally convinced her male colleagues of her research abilities and earned tenure as associate professor at the [[University of Chicago]]. From 1923 to 1929, she was also dean in the College of Arts, Literature and Science. She earned full professorship in 1925, and in 1929 she served as the dean of pre-professional social service students and Samuel Deutsch professor of public welfare administration until her retirement from the faculty in 1933.

==Important works==
===''The Delinquent Child and the Home'' (1912)===

''The Delinquent Child and the Home'' was one of Breckinridge's first books. It was published in 1912 and looks specifically at crime, consequences, and criminal records of children in Chicago. There are eleven chapters that explain the study and expected outcomes of children that live in different settings in the city. Some notable chapters include the first chapter, Discretion of the Inquiry. This chapter talks about children who have been charged with crimes, how the family unit has an impact on this, and how the court needs to make adjustments in its system when working with juveniles.

"The Child of the Immigrant: The Problem of Adjustment" looks at the impact of children growing up in ethnic enclaves in Chicago in the early 1900s. Sophonisba alludes to examples of young people adjusting to life in the United States or how they are understanding what it means to live in America while living a different kind of life in the home that ties back to their own roots or their parents cultures. "The Poor Child: The Problem of Poverty" talks about how poverty often is the reason for juvenile delinquency. Breckinridge says it is usually because they are engaging in activities in order to survive, help their families, or do not have a school to go to that may help in lessening delinquent activity. "The Child Without Play: The Problem of Neighborhood", specifically refers to the West side of Chicago in the early 1900s and explains how dense neighborhoods are often where the most crime occurs among children because of the lack of parks and space for children to roam freely. In "The Child from the Comfortable Home: The Problem of the Unmanageable", Breckinridge speaks in the final parts of her book about how there could be underlying problems from growing up. Though most of these children are from good homes and live under authority, sometimes they are sent to boarding schools where they might be better disciplined. Breckinridge points out the opposing classes in this chapter by explaining how children from families of higher social status are put in a boarding school while children from families of lower social classes usually face court or put in a state mandated institution.

===''The Modern Household'' (1912)===

Written in 1912, ''The Modern Household'' analyzes the stereotypically feminine role in the domestic and social spheres. For those women who worked, Breckinridge and Talbot point out, they would end up with double obligations because they would also have to maintain a house. The wife would also need to maintain certain household style that indicated a wealthier lifestyle. There are assumptions such as that every house would have, at least, a housekeeper and multiple children. Talbot and Breckinridge incorporate the legal angles, economic perspectives, and social roles. This book serves focus on guiding the smallest details, such as preparation food, as well as covering the larger issues like house income. The authors remark how the world is already changing with the influx of technology. At the end of each chapter, she has a list of questions for the reader to reflect upon. The language used in ''The Modern Household'' is more formal but very clear.

===''New Homes for Old'' (1921)===

In her book ''New Homes For Old'', published in 1921, Breckinridge discusses various aspects of the immigrant experience when moving to the United States. She begins with the adjustment which these immigrants must undergo upon arrival and the process of finding a new home in an unfamiliar place. Breckinridge then transitions to an analysis of the relationships within the immigrant family, detailing work situations, family structures, and certain living conditions. In the next section, she addresses taking care of the household, focusing on the responsibilities of the woman in a family. She follows with an explanation of the financial needs and difficulties faced by immigrants, including currency changes, special events, property ownership, the irregularity of income, and buying items such as furniture and clothing. Next is a discussion of the care of children, addressing issues such as school, parental authority, and dealings with the juvenile court. The next two sections address organizations and institutions which offer and provides aid to immigrants. While some of these organizations are focused on specific immigrant groups, others are more general and provide both support and education for varied groups of immigrants. The final section of the book addresses the need for involvement of a social work agency for those immigrant families who have been unable to successfully adjust and are facing difficulties.

===''Marriage and the Civic Rights of Women: separate domicil and independent citizenship'' (1931)===

Published in 1931, the focus of ''Marriage and the Civic Rights of Women: separate domicil and independent citizenship'' is studying the effect of the [[Cable Act]]s on women born in other countries who, after moving to the United States, needed to prepare themselves for independent citizenship. The first section addresses a legal approach to the problem, concerning questions such as separate domicil (place of residence) for married women, their independent citizenship, and flaws in the citizenship legislation which the Cable Act had failed to correct. Also discussed is the situation of women born in other countries who, by marrying American citizens, forfeited their nationality of origin without acquiring American citizenship in addition to a summary of the movement to implement an International Convention dealing with this subject. In the second section a social interpretation of these issues is established, presenting a case study based on interviews with a considerable number of women and some men living in Chicago. This case study illustrates the attitude, the motivating forces and the problems of women born outside the United States who have succeeded in obtaining their papers and have become citizens, those who have tried to do so and have failed, and those who have not yet tried

===''Women in the Twentieth Century; A Study of Their Political, Social and Economic Activities'' (1933)===

''Women in the Twentieth Century; A Study of Their Political, Social and Economic Activities'' was published in 1933. Breckinridge's work shows her careful documentation of the social situations and cultural climates that produced various political, social, and economic interest groups. She provided the material in a clear, chronological manner with estimates of attendance to conferences and members, along with mission statements. From the beginning of the text, she demonstrates her observations by reflecting on the environment she lived in through her data collection. Breckinridge references other sociologists like Edith Abbott in her literature. In "Chapter II: The Nineties &amp;ndash; An Introduction to the New Century," Breckinridge presents a detailed account of the beginning of women joining clubs. An example listed is the General Federation of Women's Clubs which was founded in 1890. This group had certain requirements that, in turn, restricted membership: "Article IV of the adopted constitution provided that clubs applying for membership in the General Federation must show that no sectarian or political test is required and that while distinctly humanitarian movements may be recognized, their chief purpose is not philanthropic or technical, but social, literary, artistic or scientific culture."&lt;ref&gt;http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/cool:@field(DOCID+@lit(lg59T000)) pages 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; The various groups formations begin with groups like The National American Woman Suffrage Association and the Women's Christian Associations but within the decade, there was also the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, National Association of Colored Women, and the National Congress of Mothers All of these eventually evolved to include occupational focuses National Woman's Trade Union League, Quota International, the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. She also focuses on the macro level as seen by "The Industrial Problem as it affects Women and Children." These business changes created legislation similar to current labor laws. For example, "no child under 14 years of age be employed in mill, factory, workshop, store, office, or laundry, and no boy under 16 years in mines" and required schools to provide education to the community.&lt;ref&gt;http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/cool:@field(DOCID+@lit(lg59T000)) page 21&lt;/ref&gt; The trend of new groups emerging continued exponentially lead to a societal shift in understanding the social roles. Consequently, Breckinridge points out that the labor market has to change because up until this point, the majority of workers were men and their relationship had different connotations than with married women who wanted to work. Overall, Women in the Twentieth Century demonstrates her progressive and scrutinizing lens through which she views the world.

The '''Survey of Activities of Young People''' (SAYP) is a national household-based [[Statistical survey|survey]] of work-related activities among [[South Africa]]n [[child]]ren, conducted for the first time in 1999 by [[Statistics South Africa]].

The official results were released in October 2002, and provides a national, quantitative picture. It also gives an indication of the different categories of working children who are most in need or who are at the greatest risk of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] in work and [[employment]].

The survey constituted the first step in the development of the South African ''[[Child Labour Programme of Action (South Africa)|Child Labour Programme of Action]]'' which was provisionally adopted in September 2003.

A household-based survey cannot pick up some of the worst forms of [[child labour]] &amp;mdash; for this reason, qualitative research projects are undertaken or planned by the "[[Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour]]" (TECL) Programme.

In Nepal, until 1950, Tamangs were neither accepted into government posts, whether administrative, judicial or political, nor allowed to accept foreign employment, serving as a labour pool for the ruling class.&lt;ref name="bluespace" /&gt; But nowadays, Tamangs are highly respected as Buddhist Monks (priest) as [[rinpoche]], khempo. In many Tamang Villages, there is still a tradition of sending the second son to study Buddhism and preferably to remain in the Monastery, and serve as a Buddhist Monk throughout his life.

The Nepal Government has considered that the empowerment of Tamang community is essential to in order to increase the living standard of the people. On August 3 the Nepalese parliament adopted a bill amending the Civil Service Act 1993. The amendments provide reservations for disadvantaged groups by allocating 45 percent of the jobs in the bureaucracy to these groups.

Today they inhabit the borders of Nepal and Tibet, due to marginalization from Kathmandu, and are among the groups hardest hit by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]].

==Political participation==
Tamangs are represented by [[Tamsaling Rastriya Mukti Morcha]] and [[Tamsaling Nepal Rastriya Dal]], neither of which holds any seats in Parliament. The umbrella group [[Mongol National Organisation]] supports self-determination and works against said discrimination not just for Tamangs but for all Mongoloid groups in Nepal.  Mongol National is against conversion to Hinduism of non-Hindus, but it holds no official parliamentary vote. [[Federal Limbuwan State Council]] (FLSC) also works towards similar goals for [[self-determination]] for the [[Kirati people]]s, who co-mingle with Tamangs, citing a reneged treaty with Kathmandu for autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Chemjong, Iman Singh (2003). History and Culture of Kirat People (4th ed.). Kathmandu: Kirat Yakthung Chumlung. {{ISBN|99933-809-1-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The associated [[Sanghiya Limbuwan Party]] has participated in calling [[bandh|banda]] during the [[2015 Nepal blockade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sanghiya-limbuwan-party-calls-indefinite-eastern-region-bandh/ |title=Sanghiya Limbuwan Party calls indefinite Eastern Region bandh |publisher=The Himalayan Times |date=2015-09-04 |accessdate=2015-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223090948/http://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sanghiya-limbuwan-party-calls-indefinite-eastern-region-bandh/ |archivedate=2015-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless international press had not only failed to take note of their ''bandh'', but even pretended not to notice their very existence and instead focused intently on 4 party India-backed Madhesi Morcha actions, geopolitical concerns with [[China]], as [[Limbuwan]] also opposes both the Madhesi goals as well as Kathmandu's domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Om Astha Rai |url=http://nepalitimes.com/regular-columns/As-It-Happens/Nepal-needs-to-look-within-and-mend-fences,603 |title=Look south &amp;#124; As It Happens |publisher=Nepali Times |date= |accessdate=2015-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223143548/http://nepalitimes.com/regular-columns/As-It-Happens/Nepal-needs-to-look-within-and-mend-fences,603 |archivedate=2015-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is rationale to India and Western nation's denial of information about Limbuwan actions during the fuel blockade, in the 1980s, a violent [[Gorkhaland]] movement within [[India]] was led by the prominent Tamang [[Subhas Ghising]] to which India had viewed as a security threat due to the proximity of [[Siliguri Corridor|India's chicken neck]].&lt;ref name="EmergentNE" /&gt; [[Madan Tamang]], a Tamang-Indian politician, and proponent for Gorkhaland statehood, was assassinated in 2010, with [[West Bengal]] government placing blame on another Gorkhaland political party, in effect weakening the movement. [[Gorkhaland Territorial Administration]] was then created in place of statehood in [[India]], nevertheless across the border, ethnic discrimination issues regarding the numerous Mongoloid groups (who have taken part in each other's politics) are left unresolved within Nepal. In 2017 [[Binay Tamang]] was appointed as the Chairperson of GTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gta-reconstituted-rebel-gjm-leader-tamang-is-chairperson/article19724174.ece|title=GTA reconstituted, rebel GJM leader Tamang is chairperson|date=2017-09-21|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-02-28|others=Special Correspondent, Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228230723/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gta-reconstituted-rebel-gjm-leader-tamang-is-chairperson/article19724174.ece|archivedate=2018-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Tamang Gompa, Jorpati (02).jpg|thumb|Tamang Gompa, Jorpati (02)]]
The religion is considered by Tamangs as [[Nyingma]] tradition of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, the earliest form of Buddhism to come to Nepal/Tibet with Padmasambhava, and due to geopolitical focus on Tibet, Tamangs hold their beliefs are also ''largely ignored'' by Western scholars.&lt;ref name="bluespace"/&gt;    Tamang have [[gompa]]s (monasteries) in every sizeable village.  Every family has their special Buddhist Yidam and book to practice every morning. The Tamangs retain ''jhankris'' (shamans) in addition to their [[Lama clan (Tamang)]] (priests), the latter whose surnames are also Lama.  Additionally there exists the honorific term [[Lama (honorific)]], assigned to all Tamang regardless of kinship clan (''swagen bhai'').  This is not to be confused with [[Lama]] of Tibet or the [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] Lama surname and clan.  These jhankris perform certain rites such as trances and sacrifices to alleviate problems or assure good fortune.&lt;ref name="bluespace"/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Tamang'' was derived from the word ''Tamag'', where ''Ta'' means “horse”, and ''Mag'' means “soldier”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://advancedadventures.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/tamang-people-of-nepal/|title=Who actually are the Tamang People?

==Culture==

===Festivals===
'''Sonam Lhochhar'''  is the main festival of the Tamangs and is celebrated in the month on Magh (February - March).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://streetnepal.com/sonam-lhochhar-celebrated/|title=Sonam Lhochhar celebrated  {{!}} Street Nepal|website=streetnepal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816080424/http://streetnepal.com/sonam-lhochhar-celebrated/|archivedate=2016-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is celebrated to welcome the Tamang new year.

Colorful flags, printed Buddhist [[mantra]] cloths are put up in various places in villages and towns.&lt;ref name="Ghimire" /&gt;  The Tamangs have a genre of music called called " ''[[Tamang Selo]]"'' that is performed with the ''[[Damphu_drum|Damplu]]'' instrument, also known as Damphoo Dance, having a brisk movement and rhythmic beat specific to the Tamangs.&lt;ref name="EmergentNE" /&gt;

The second most important festival is '''Saga Dawa''' (Buddha Jayanti) and is celebrated as a religious festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://advancedadventures.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/tamang-people-of-nepal/|title=Who actually are the Tamang People? An Insight into Indigenous Tribe of Nepal|date=2015-01-05|work=Chronicles of ADVENTURE TRAVEL|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301044744/https://advancedadventures.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/tamang-people-of-nepal/|archive-date=2018-03-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Dashain]] and [[Tihar (festival)]] is also celebrated with much enthusiasm by Tamangs.&lt;ref name="Ghimire" /&gt;

===Livelihood===
Most Tamangs are farmers, engaged in [[agriculture]]. Due to the lack of irrigation at higher altitudes, their crops are often limited to corn, millet, wheat, barley, and potatoes.  They often supplement their farming income with manual labour.  Due to the discrimination experienced by the Tamang people in the past, they have remained on the whole poorly educated, and the majority have been limited to working as farmers, mountain trekking, portering, and driving in Kathmandu. They also work in manufacture of Tibetan rugs, Thankas (Tibetan painting), driving and labour.&lt;ref name="bluespace" /&gt;  As far as farming is concerned, Tamang are dependent on rainfall and do not employ modern machinery.&lt;ref name="Ghimire" /&gt;

===Kinship clans===
Thars ([[Tamang language]]:''Swagen Bhai'') are exogamous clans with complex intermarriage restrictions.  There are over 39 listed ''swagen bhai'' in one study.&lt;ref name="Ghimire"/&gt;

==Origins and history==
Tamangs are coming from tibet and have long inhabited Kathmandu Valley and the hills of Nepal in general, yet the origins of Tamang are exactly from upper tibet( around govi desert ) according to archiological study done by Dr. anatoly yakoblave shetenko, yet they believe they are indigenous to the area had once ruled lhasa. They have beliefs that they have been descended from bhote which is called as [[tibet]] in modern district.&lt;ref name="bluespace"/&gt;Tamang found in sikkim also

==Trekking and tourism==
Tamang villages are often visited on Nepal's numerous trekking routes, one being labelled ''Tamang Heritage Trail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Post Report |url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2015-07-30/tamang-heritage-trail-reopens-after-quake.html |title=The Kathmandu Post :: Tamang Heritage Trail reopens after quake |publisher=Kathmandupost.ekantipur.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065012/http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2015-07-30/tamang-heritage-trail-reopens-after-quake.html |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also work as porters and the chances are that the porters and guides on a Trek are more likely to be a Tamang than an actual [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]].&lt;ref name="bluespace"/&gt;

We want new laws that curtail online surveillance. Today we fight back."&lt;ref name=Hill /&gt; Organizers hoped lawmakers would be made aware "that there's going to be ongoing public pressure until these reforms are instituted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Siner|first=Emily|title=The Internet Flexes Political Muscle With Anti-NSA Protest|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/02/11/274901562/the-internet-flexes-political-muscle-with-anti-nsa-protest|publisher=NPR|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest was announced on January 10, 2014, by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF).&lt;ref name="MintPress News" /&gt; Other early organizers included digital rights groups such as [[Fight for the Future]], and [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], as well as social media website [[Reddit]], [[Firefox]] producer [[Mozilla]], collaborative blogging website [[Boing Boing]], and populist advocacy group '"The Other 98%".&lt;ref name="PCWorld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MintPress News" /&gt;&lt;ref name="International Business Times" /&gt;

According to the official website, the protest asked U.S. "legislators to oppose the [[FISA Improvements Act]], support the [[USA Freedom Act]], and enact protections for non-Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thedaywefightback.org/ |title=Today, February 11th, 2014 is The Day We Fight Back against mass surveillance |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/02/data-spying-feb-11-to-become-the-day-we-fight-back/ |title=Data Spying: Feb. 11 To Become "The Day We Fight Back" |publisher=Valuewalk.com|date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|02|12}}&lt;!-- the lede needs to be updated with the actual day reality, rather than merely a pre-event projection, and should explicate what, if any, impact followed. --&gt; Protest organizers said roughly 96,000 calls were placed to members of Congress and 555,000 "pro-privacy emails" were sent via the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Damon|first=Poeter|title=The Day We Fight Back Generates Nearly 100K Calls To Congress|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2453387,00.asp|accessdate=17 February 2014|work=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The Day We Fight Back was intended as a day of "worldwide solidarity" in protest against NSA surveillance. It was at once an action against censorship and surveillance, and a commemoration of late "open-Internet activist" [[Aaron Swartz]].&lt;ref name="International Business Times" /&gt; In the US, a main goal of the protest was to encourage passage of the [[USA Freedom Act]], a bill that seeks to reign in telephone data collection. Additionally, the banner urged people to call Congress and voice opposition to the [[FISA Improvements Act]], which the ACLU called "a dream come true for the NSA" that would "codify the NSA's unconstitutional call-records program and allow bulk collection of location data from mobile phone users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wagstaff|first=Keith|title=Reddit, Tumblr and More Protest NSA With 'Day We Fight Back'|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/reddit-tumblr-more-protest-nsa-day-we-fight-back-n26416|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the US, the goal was similar. A ''Guardian'' op-ed described the activists' objective globally as "to push authorities toward policies favoring liberty and privacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gilmore|first=Dan|title=Get ready: the day we fight back against mass surveillance is coming|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/nsa-fighting-back-against-surveillence-state|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers posted to their website: "Together we will push back against powers that seek to observe, collect, and analyze our every digital action.Together, we will make it clear that such behavior is not compatible with democratic governance. Together, if we persist, we will win this fight."&lt;ref name=PC4,000 /&gt; Rainey Reitman, director of activism at the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]], said, "The idea is to really harness the outrage of the Internet community in speaking out in one big voice on Feb. 11." The protest comes a month after President Obama made a surveillance reform speech introducing his proposed changes to the collection of US citizens' data. Critics said the reformations wouldn't be "nearly enough".g&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite news |last=Hattem|first=Julian|title="The idea is to really harness the outrage of the Internet community in speaking out in one big voice on Feb. 11," said Rainey Reitman, the director of activism at the Electronic Frontier Foundation|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/197859-thousands-of-sites-to-protest-nsa-spying |publisher=The Hill|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers compared the February protest with the SOPA protest two years prior, saying, "Today we face a different threat, one that undermines the Internet and the notion that any of us live in a genuinely free society". The threats were 'International counterparts like [[Five Eyes]] and [[Tempora]], mass surveillance, and programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], Canada's [[Communications Security Establishment Canada|CSEC]] airport monitoring activities'.&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{cite news |last=Rickwood|first=Lee|title=Protesting mass surveillance: Canada called to join The Day We Fight Back|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/technology/Protesting+mass+surveillance+Canada+called+join+Fight+Back/9468059/story.html|work=Calgary Herald|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Day We Fight Back was promoted in a trailer for an upcoming documentary about Aaron Swartz, currently titled ''The Internet's Own Boy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/11/aaron-swartz-documentary_n_4578257.html |title=Aaron Swartz Documentary Clip Reveals Activist's Thoughts On NSA, Pushes Day Of Action |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |first=Joanna |last=Zelman |date=January 11, 2014 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the clip, the late activist comments on [[Global surveillance|mass surveillance]]: "It is shocking to think that the accountability is so lax that they don't even have sort of basic statistics about how big the spying programme is. If the answer is, 'Oh, we're spying on so many people we can't possibly even count them,' then that's an awful lot of people."

===Reddit "Ask Me Anything" ===
Comparing the opposition to surveillance with the previous defeat of SOPA, in which Demand Progress and Aaron Swartz had been deeply involved, the organizers took to Reddit and called for a month of activities culminating in the February 11 "day of action"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1uw05k/aaron_swartz_passed_away_a_year_ago_tomorrow_we/ |title=Aaron Swartz passed away a year ago tomorrow.

Those participating were [[Cory Doctorow]] of [[BoingBoing]]; [[Brian Knappenberger]], who made the films ''The Internet's Own Boy'', a documentary about Aaron Swartz, and ''[[We Are Legion]]'', a film about the hacker group "Anonymous"; [[David Segal (politician)|David Segal]], co-founder of [[Demand Progress]]; Peter Eckersley of [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]; and [[Sina Khanifar]], website developer for "The Day We Fight Back" and several other activist projects.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Doctorow and Eckersley indicated they had been close friends of Swartz.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

:Two years ago, reddit and its users joined in fighting back against dangerous Internet censorship legislation during the SOPA protests. You blacked out your websites and started hundreds of creative campaigns to defeat a piece of legislation that threatened freedom on the Internet.

:In the last 6 months we've seen that government agencies, namely the NSA and GCHQ and others, have broken laws and twisted legal interpretations to create an infrastructure of mass surveillance of all of us online. This creates a dark form of censorship as people become afraid to speak freely -- and it's one that undermines our security and our right to privacy as well. As users of the Internet, we have a responsibility to defend its freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Segal|first=David|title=We are "The Day We Fight Back" Organizers, Ask Us Anything|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm761/we_are_the_day_we_fight_back_organizers_ask_us/|publisher=Reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaron Swartz was an American activist who founded the online group [[Demand Progress]], known for its campaign against the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA).

Sites like Tumblr, Mozilla and [[DuckDuckGo]], which were listed as organizers, did not include the banner on their homepages. The eight major technology companies—Google, [[Microsoft]], Facebook, AOL, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], Twitter, Yahoo and LinkedIn ... only participated Tuesday insofar as having a joint website flash the protest banner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/the-day-the-internet-didnt-fight-back/ |title=The Day the Internet Didn't Fight Back |work=[[The New York Times]] |series=Bits |first=Nicole |last=Perlroth |date=February 11, 2014 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although '''Tibetan Canadians''', or '''Canadians of Tibetan ancestry''', comprise a small portion of Asian [[Canadians]], Canada holds one of the largest concentrations of Tibetans outside Asia. Tibetans began immigrating to Canada as early as the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="macpherson"&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/USFocus/display.cfm?ID=693 Global Nomads: The Emergence of the Tibetan Diaspora (Part I)], by Seonaigh MacPherson (University of British Columbia), Anne-Sophie Bentz (Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies), Dawa Bhuti Ghoso&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
In 2016, the Tibetan population in Canada was recorded as being 8,040.&lt;ref name="statcan1"/&gt;

The majority of Tibetan-Canadians live in the [[Toronto]] metropolitan area. In 2016, there were 6,035 Tibetan-Canadians living in the [[Greater Toronto Area]].&lt;ref name="statcan1"/&gt; There is a sizable Tibetan community with Tibetan businesses and restaurants, known as [[Little Tibet (Toronto)|Little Tibet]], in the [[Parkdale, Toronto|Parkdale]] neighborhood in Toronto, in the area bound by Queen St. W. to the north, the Gardiner Expressway to the west and south, and Atlantic Ave. to the east. There is also a growing Tibetan community in South Etobicoke.&lt;ref name=thestar&gt;Loriggio, Paola.[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2008/05/15/at_home_in_little_tibet.html 'At home' in Little Tibet], ''[[Toronto Star]]''. May 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Displaced Tibetan ==
Tibetans that have migrated to Canada and other countries have been subjected to a complex and violent history. Being under the rule of the Dalai Lama, Tibet was seen as a contained region on the global scale. This was true between the years 1912 to 1950.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;Logan, J., &amp; Murdie, R. (2016). Home in Canada? The Settlement Experiences of Tibetans in Parkdale, Toronto. ''Journal Of International Migration And Integration'', ''17''(1), 95-113&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period of time, this was independent Tibet .

The official religion of Tibet in the 13th century was Buddhism Tibet.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dhussa, R. C. (2009). Tibet: A Nation in Exile. American Geographical Society's Focus On Geography, 52(2), 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, China occupied Tibet causing the Tibetan government to be also under Chinese jurisdiction. Throughout the years, culture and religion took an impact from Chinese occupation which was expressed through the ruination of religious statues of Tibet and the destruction of buildings that represented the Tibetan culture &lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

In 1959, around 87,000 are killed during the Chinese occupation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Tibetans that practiced their religion were killed. At least 80 000 Tibetans and the Dalai Lama left Tibet to Nepal but were denied access.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;Raska, J. (2016). Humanitarian Gesture: Canada and the Tibetan Resettlement Program, 1971-5. ''Canadian Historical Review'', ''97''(4), 546-575.&lt;/ref&gt; Then they found refuge in India.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; India took them, however had difficulty to give imperative services and help needed to Tibetan refugees. However, there were more migration patterns towards India in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;

During the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees in 1951, India did not sign this convention. This entailed that Tibetans living in India had little rights and hence tried to find another place for resettlement.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

=== Nomadic Lifestyle ===
Tibetan’s nomadic life style was notably present when China had a significant control over the geographical area of Tibet, the Chinese occupation. Therefore, Tibetans started to move and not submitting to this control.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This means Tibetans were being displaced within their borders.

==Tibetan resettlement to Canada==

In 1970 and 1971, 240 Tibetan refugees settled into Canada from India. The resettlement of Tibetan refugees was viewed by the Canadian government as a pilot project to evaluate what the country would do in the future regarding refugee aid. It was after a direct plea from the [[Dalai Lama]] to Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]] in 1966 that launched Canada's slow process to bring 60 families into their country. The first Tibetans to arrive from the resettlement group were Tsering Dorjee Wangkhang and Jampa Dorjee Drongotsang when they landed in Toronto on October 15, 1970. The two settled in [[Batawa]], Ontario where the first Tibetan community was planned to be located. Wangkhang and Drongotsang both started working at the Bata shoe factory. Factory owner Thomas Bata had gone to India, one of the countries where Tibetans were exiled, and took the initiative to employ three to four refugees in his company.&lt;ref&gt;Dubinsky, Karen, et al. Canada and the Third World: Overlapping Histories. University of Toronto Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a two-year immigration program to bring 2,000 Tibetan refugees to Canada was organized by Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] after a plea by the Dalai Lama. The first 21 Tibetans flew from India to Vancouver International Airport and were expected to settle into the [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Sunshine Coast (British Columbia)|Sunshine Coast]] areas.&lt;ref name="Bradley, A. 2010"&gt;Bradley, A. (2010). Beyond Borders: Cosmopolitanism and Family Reunification for Refugees in Canada. International Journal Of Refugee Law, 22(3), 379-403.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Home in Canada and Integration Process ==
Canada originally declined Tibetan refugees to settle as a group, however this changed with consultations and national meeting with the Prime minister, Pierre Elliot Trudeau. This involved the one of the previous high commissioners to India called James George. James Gorge’s impact on Pierre Elliot Trudeau helped immigration officials to be more lenient with refuge policies for Tibetans.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;

In the 1960s, the Canadian government accepts Tibetan refugees under a few conditions. These conditions were set under the Tibetan Refugee program. This was an experimental program that would let 228 Tibetans enter Canada quickly and at a lower cost.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

It took a decade for the first Tibetans migrants to set foot in Canada. The Canadian government officials did not want Tibetans to settle in a group but on individual basis and family basis. This means that only young families and single people coming as laborers were approved to seek refuge in Canada. Additionally, Canadian immigration officials were concerned about Tibetans nomadic lifestyles and establishing/settling themselves as a group. This would pose a challenge on the integration process. If group settlement had been approved, the integration process would have been much more difficult and permanency of integration would also be a challenge for new comers and pose issues on the governmental level.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Canadian immigration officials were worried that it would pose problems. Such problems were isolation and dependence within members of the same ethnic community. Additionally, learning one of the official languages of Canada was another problem that could arise and could affect integration directly (Logan &amp; Murdie, 2014). Moreover, immigration officials chose younger Tibetan immigrants over older immigrant groups because integration would be easier regarding the process of learning one of the official languages. Therefore, finding a job and reaching out if one needs help or services would also be affected positively.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Batarseh, R. C. (2016). Inside/Outside the Circle: From the Indochinese Designated Class to Contemporary Group Processing. Refuge (0229-5113), 32(2), 54-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan immigrants were also selected from towns and villages because knowing their nomadic lifestyle, immigrant officials wanted Tibetans that had sedentary patterns. Tibetans also needed to have a certain level of high education.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Integration was facilitated through “group processing” which involves refugees and the state work together to aid resettlement into Canada.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

== Parkdale, Toronto ==
The neighbourhood of [[Parkdale, Toronto|Parkdale]] in [[Toronto]] contains the largest concentration of Tibetan immigrants and refugees in Canada. As of the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canadian Census]], around 11% of Parkdale residents were of Tibetan ethnicity, comprising 1,985 persons (62% of Toronto's total Tibetan population and 42% of Tibetans in all of Canada).&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; According to global population estimates, this makes the Parkdale Tibetan community the largest outside of Tibet and its surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/global-nomads-emergence-tibetan-diaspora-part-i&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the housing in the area consists of high-rise apartment buildings and single-family homes. Compared to much of the Toronto core, rent prices in Parkdale are affordable, and the area provides many amenities and services to recent immigrants and at-risk populations. Additionally, public transit offers accessibility to the city centre of Toronto.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== Culture and Community ===
Parkdale's existing Tibetan community and cultural institutions encourage the continued immigration of Tibetans to the neighbourhood, with 64% of Tibetan immigrants citing the existing presence of other Tibetans as a major factor in their decision to settle in the area.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; [[Little Tibet, Toronto|Little Tibet]] is centered around a series of blocks on [[Queen Street West]], consisting of a number of Tibetan restaurants and shops with diverse influences from India, Nepal and China.

=== Family Reunification Concerns ===
Within Parkdale, a significant concern among Tibetan Canadian families is reunification with their relatives. Tibetans living in Canada that have already obtained permanent residency have found difficulty bringing their family members into Canada. Many of the relatives that have been unable to come to Canada live in Nepal and India. Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) states that the Nepalese government is blocking Tibetan peoples that found refuge in Nepal after 1989 from exiting the country. India imposes that Tibetans must have a valid Identity Certificate to exit the country, and the process of obtaining this document can take several years.&lt;ref name="Bradley, A. 2010"/&gt;

The '''Tibetan calendar''' ({{bo|t=ལོ་ཐོ|w=lo-tho}}) is a [[lunisolar calendar]], that is, the Tibetan year is composed of either 12 or 13 [[lunar month]]s, each beginning and ending with a [[new moon]]. A thirteenth month is added every two or three years, so that an average Tibetan year is equal to the [[solar year]].

The Tibetan [[New Year]] celebration is [[Losar]] ({{bo|t=ལོ་གསར་|w=lo-gsar}}). According to almanacs the year starts with the third Hor month. There were many different traditions in Tibet to fix the beginning of the year. The dates of [[Mongolian calendar]] are all the same with it.

==Years==

There were different traditions of naming years ({{bo|t=ལོ་|w=lo}}) in Tibet. From the 12th century onwards, we observe the usage of two sixty-year cycles. The 60-year cycle is known as the [[Vṛhaspati]] cycle and was first introduced into Tibet by an Indian Buddhist by the name of Chandranath and Tsilu Pandit in 1025 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Sarat Chandra Das, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YNm2kWddMNQC&amp;pg=PR8 ''A Tibetan-English dictionary: with Sanskrit synonyms''], p. viii (accessed: October 25, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The first cycle is the ''rabjyung'' ({{bo|t=རབ་བྱུང༌།|w=rab byung}}) cycle. The first year of the first ''rabjyung'' cycle started in 1027. This cycle was adopted from India. The second cycle was derived from China and was called ''Drukchu kor'' ({{bo|t=དྲུག་ཅུ་སྐོར།|w=drug cu skor}}, Sanskrit ''Vrhaspati''). The first year of the first ''Drukchu kor'' cycle started in 1024. The cycles were counted by [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]]s, but the years within the cycles were never counted but referred to by special names. The structure of the ''drukchu kor'' was as follows:
Each year is associated with an animal and an [[Classical element#Bön elements|element]], similar to the [[Chinese zodiac]]. Animals have the following order:
:{| border="1" class="wikitable"
| [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]]||[[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]]||[[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]]||[[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]]||[[Goat (zodiac)|Goat]]||[[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]]||[[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]]||[[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]]||[[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]]||[[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]]||[[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]]||[[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]]
|}
Elements have the following order:
:{| border="1" class="wikitable"
| Fire||Earth||Iron||Water||Wood
|}

Each element is associated with two consecutive years, first in its male aspect, then in its female aspect. For example, a '''male Earth-[[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]]''' year is followed by a '''female Earth-[[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]]''' year, then by a '''male Iron-[[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]]''' year. The sex may be omitted, as it can be inferred from the animal.

The element-animal designations recur in cycles of 60 years (a [[Sexagenary cycle]]), starting with a (male) '''Wood-[[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]]''' year. These large cycles are numbered, the first cycle starting in 1024. Therefore, 2005 roughly corresponds to the (female) '''Wood-[[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]]''' year of the 17th cycle. The first year of the sixty-year cycle of Indian origin (1027) is called ''rab-byung'' (same name as the designation of the cycle) and is equivalent to the (female) fire-[[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]] year.

===Years with cardinal numbers===
Three relatively modern notations of [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s are used for Tibetan years.

On [[Historical money of Tibet|Tibetan banknotes]] from the first half of the 20th century cardinal numbers can be seen, with year 1 in 255 CE, which is a reference to the legendary [[List of emperors of Tibet|28th Emperor of Tibet]], [[Thothori Nyantsen]].

Since the second half of the 20th century another year notation has been used, where the year of, for example, 2009 coincides with the Tibetan year of 2136. This relatively modern year notation is referred to as ''Bö Gyello'' (''bod rgyal lo''). In this era the first year is 127 BCE, dated to the [[legendary progenitor]] of the [[Yarlung dynasty]], [[Nyatri Tsenpo]].

In Tibetan calendars of the second half of the 20th century and on Tibetan [[Historical money of Tibet|coins]] cardinal year numbers are found with the indication of ''raplo'', where the first year coincides with the first year of the ''rabjyung''-cycle, that is 1027. ''Rab lo'' 928, for example, is the year of 1954 on the western [[Gregorian calendar]].

==Months==

During the time of the [[Tibetan Empire]] (7th – 9th century) Tibetan months ({{bo|w=zla ba|t=ཟླ་བ་}}) were named according to the four seasons:

:First spring month (''dpyid zla ra ba''), middle spring month (''dpyid zla 'bring po''), last spring month (''dpyid zla mtha' chung''), 
:first summer month (''dbyar zla ra ba''), middle summer month (''dbyar zla 'bring po''), last summer month (''dbyar zla mtha' chung''), 
:first autumn month (''ston zla ra ba''), middle autumn month (''ston-zla 'bring-po''), last autumn month (''ston zla mtha' chung''), 
:first winter month (''dgun zla ra ba''), middle winter month (''dgun-zla 'bring-po'') and last winter month (''dgun zla mtha' chung'').

From the 12th century onwards each month has been named by the 12 animals of the [[Chinese zodiac]]:

:''stag'' ([[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]]), ''yos'' ([[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]]),'' 'brug'' ([[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]]), ''sbrul'' ([[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]]), ''rta'' ([[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]]), ''lug'' ([[Goat (zodiac)|Goat]]), 
:''spre'u'' ([[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]]), ''bya'' ([[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]]), ''khyi'' ([[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]]), ''phag'' ([[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]]), ''byi'' ([[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]]) and ''glang'' ([[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]]).

With the introduction of the calendar of the ''Kalacakratantra'' in the second half of the 11th century, months were also named via lunar mansions within which, roughly speaking, a full moon took place each month:

{|
|
:1st: Chu (''mchu'', Skt. ''māgha'') 
:2nd: Wo (''dbo'', Skt. ''phālguna'')
:3rd: Nagpa (''nag pa'', Skt. ''caitra'')
:4th: Saga (''sa ga'', Skt. ''vaiśākha'')
:5th: Non (''snron'', Skt. ''jyeṣṭha'')
:6th: Chuto (''chu stod'', Skt. ''āṣāḍha'')
:7th: Drozhin (''gro bzhin'', Skt. ''śrāvaṇa'')
:8th: Trum (''khrums'', Skt. ''bhādrapada'')
:9th: Takar (''tha skar'', Skt. ''āśvina'') 
:10th: Mindrug (''smin drug'', Skt. ''kārttika'')
:11th: Go (''mgo'', Skt. ''mārgaśīrṣa'')
:12th: Gyal (''rgyal'', Skt. ''pauṣa'')
|}

In the second half of the 13th century the famous ruler [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]] introduced the system of counting the month by ordinal numbers, the so-called ''Hor'' "Mongolian" month:

{|
|
:1st Hor month (''hor-zla dang-po'')
:2nd Hor month (''hor-zla gnyis-pa'')
:3rd Hor month (''hor-zla gsum-pa'')
:4th Hor month (''hor-zla bzhi-pa'')
:5th Hor month (''hor-zla lnga-pa'')
:6th Hor month (''hor-zla drug-pa'')
|
:7th Hor month (''hor-zla bdun-pa'')
:8th Hor month (''hor-zla brgyad-pa'')
:9th Hor month (''hor-zla dgu-pa'')
:10th Hor month (''hor-zla bcu-pa'')
:11th Hor month (''hor-zla bcu-gcig-pa'')
:12th Hor month (''hor-zla bcu-gnyis-pa'')
|}

All these systems of counting or naming months were used up to modern times.

==Days==

There are three different types of days (''zhag''), the ''khyim zhag'', the ''tshes zhag'' and the ''nyin zhag''.

The first two of these days are astronomical days. The time needed for the mean sun to pass through one of the twelve traditional signs of the zodiac (the twelve ''khyim'') is called ''khyim zla'' (solar month). One-thirtieth of one solar month (''khyim zla'') is one ''khyim zhag'', which might be called a zodiacal day, because there is no equivalent name in Western terminology.

The time needed by the moon to [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongate]] 12 degrees from the sun and every 12 degrees thereafter is one [[tithi]] (''tshes zhag'', "lunar day"). The lengths of such lunar days vary considerably due to variations in the movements of the moon and sun.

Thirty lunar days form one lunar or synodic month (''tshes zla''), the period from new moon to new moon. This is equal to the time needed for the moon to elongate 360 degrees from the sun (sun to sun). The natural day (''nyin zhag'') is defined by Tibetans as the period from dawn to dawn. Strictly speaking, the months appearing in a Tibetan almanac, called by us Tibetan calendar months, are not the same as lunar or synodic months (''tshes zla''), which can begin and end at any time of day. In Tibetan, there is no special term for a calendar month containing whole days. These calendar months are just called ''zla ba'' (month).

A Tibetan calendar month normally starts with the week day or natural day (''gza' '' or ''nyin zhag'') in which the first tithi (''tshes zhag'') ends.  A Tibetan calendar month normally ends with the week day or natural day (''gza&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' or ''nyin zhag'') in which the 30th tithi (''tshes zhag'') ends. In consequence, a Tibetan calendar month (''zla ba'') comprises 29 or 30 natural days. In the sequence of natural days or week days, there are no omitted days or days that occur twice. But since these days are also named by the term ''tshes'' together with a cardinal number, it happens that certain numbers or dates (the corresponding tithi) do not occur at all (''chad'') or appear twice (''lhag''). The tithi are counted from 1 to 30 and it can happen that a Monday with the lunar day number 1 (''tshes gcig'') is followed by a Tuesday with the moon day number 3 (''tshes gsum''). On the other hand, a Monday with the lunar day number 1 (''tshes gcig'') may be followed by a Tuesday with the lunar day number 1 (''tshes gcig''). In other words, it happens quite often that certain dates do not appear in the Tibetan almanac and certain dates occur twice. But there are no natural days or week days that occur twice or which are omitted.

The days of the week ({{bo|t=གཟའ|w=gza'}}) are named for [[astronomical object]]s.

''Nyima'' "Sun", ''Dawa'' "Moon" and ''Lhakpa'' "Mercury" are common personal names for people born on Sunday, Monday or Wednesday respectively.

==History==
During the time of the Yarlung dynasty, years were named after the 12 animals common in the [[Chinese zodiac]]. The month were named according to the four seasons of a year and the year started in summer.

The translation of the ''[[Kalachakra]]tantra'' in the second half of the 11th century CE marked the beginning of a complete change for the calendar in Tibet.  The first chapter of this book contains among others a description of an Indian astronomical calendar and descriptions of the calculations to determine the length of the five planets and the sun and moon eclipses.

According to the Buddhist tradition, the original teachings of the Kalacakra were taught by Buddha himself. Nevertheless, it took more than two hundred years until the Kalacakra calendar was officially introduced as the official Tibetan calendar by the ruler [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]] in the second half of the 13th century. Although this calendar was changed many times during the subsequent centuries, it kept its original character as a luni-solar calendar of Indian origin.

'''Vida B. Johnson''' is an American [[criminal defense attorney]] and professor of law at [[Georgetown University Law Center]]. Johnson works in the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic and Criminal Justice Clinic, and supervises attorneys in the [[E. Barrett Prettyman]] Post-Graduate Fellowship Program. Johnson regularly writes in the area of criminal law and procedure.

==Family and Education==
Johnson's grandfather, Dr. Reverend [[Allen Johnson (activist)|Allen Johnson]], was a leader in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=those&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Abbe|last2=Freedman|first2=Monroe|title=How Can You Represent Those People|publisher=palgrave|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, the Johnson family home in [[Laurel, Mississippi]] was bombed by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Johnson and his family were targeted because he was an activist in the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dittmer|first1=John|title=Local People: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi|date=1994|publisher=University of Illinois Press|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vida Johnson was raised in [[San Diego, California]].&lt;ref name=those/&gt; Johnson went to college at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite web|title=Vida Johnson Profile|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/johnson-vida.cfm#|website=georgetown.edu|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson earned her degree in American History. Johnson went on to law school at [[New York University School of Law]].&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt; Johnson went to law school wanting to be a civil rights lawyer, following in the footsteps of her grandfather.&lt;ref name=those/&gt; After her first year of law school, Johnson worked at the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center where she worked on class-action lawsuits on behalf of death row inmates at the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]].&lt;ref name=those/&gt; After her second summer, she interned at the [[San Francisco]] public defender's office. During her final year of law school, she worked in the Juvenile Defense Clinic at NYU Law.&lt;ref name=those/&gt; After law school, Johnson was an [[E. Barrett Prettyman]] fellow at Georgetown Law.&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt; As a fellow, she represented indigent adults in the [[D.C. Superior Court]] and supervised students in the Criminal Justice Clinic.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;

==Legal career==

===Public Defender Service===
After her fellowship at Georgetown Law, Johnson began work as a public defender with the trial division of the [[Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia]] (PDS), where she worked for eight years.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; At PDS, Johnson handled serious felony cases. She tried numerous felony cases in D.C. Superior Court representing indigent clients facing charges including homicide, sexual assault, and armed offenses.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; Johnson eventually became a supervisor of the trial division and served as one of the PDS's two representatives to the D.C. Superior Court Sentencing Guidelines Commission.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;

===Georgetown Law===
In 2009, Johnson began working and teaching in the Juvenile Justice Clinic at Georgetown University Law Center.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; Johnson now works in the Criminal Justice Clinic (CJC) and Criminal Defense &amp; Prisoner Advocacy Clinic (CDPAC).&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;  In her CDPAC and CJC role, she directs [[Juris Doctor]] students representing defendants facing misdemeanor charges in D.C. Superior Court.&lt;ref name=cdpac&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Defense &amp; Prisoner Advocacy Clinic (CDPAC)|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/clinical-programs/our-clinics/criminal-defense-prisoner-advocacy/|website=law.georgetown.edu|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CJC&gt;{{cite web|title=CJC Staff|url=https://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/clinical-programs/our-clinics/Criminal-Justice-Clinic/cjc-staff-contact-us.cfm|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson is also a supervisor for the E. Barrett Prettyman Fellowship and Stuart Stiller Post-Graduate Fellowship Program.&lt;ref name=prettyman&gt;{{cite web|title=Prettyman Program|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/clinical-programs/our-clinics/criminal-justice-clinic/cjc-graduate-teaching-fellowships.cfm|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The E. Barrett Prettyman and Stuart Stiller Fellowship Program combines instruction in the Law Center's graduate school with representation of indigent clients in the local courts of the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=prettymanfellow&gt;{{cite web|title=CDPAC Graduate Teaching Fellowships|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/clinical-programs/our-clinics/criminal-defense-prisoner-advocacy/graduate-teaching-fellowships.cfm|website=law.georgetown.edu|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It trains recent law graduates in both the academic and practical aspects of courtroom advocacy.&lt;ref name=prettyman/&gt; The program aims to improve defense advocacy in the criminal justice system by providing able, devoted counsel under mature supervision for indigent defendants.&lt;ref name=prettymanfellow/&gt; The fellowships are awarded to three recent law graduates selected to participate in a two-year program leading to the [[LL.M.]] degree.&lt;ref name=prettymanfellow/&gt; In the program, Johnson supervises fellows handling felonies and misdemeanors.&lt;ref name=prettyman/&gt;

==Writing and Views==
Johnson writes and teaches in the area of criminal law.

'''Vietnamese people in Korea''', also known as '''Vietnamese Koreans''', have a history going back to the latter days of Vietnam's [[Lý Dynasty]]; several princes of Lý sought refuge with the kingdom of [[Goryeo]].&lt;ref&gt;Professors review Vietnamese-Korean cultural relationship,{{cite web|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2007/07/719203/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919175244/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2007/07/719203/ |archivedate=September 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[division of Korea]] and the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnamese people]] had various contacts with both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]. In the latter, Vietnamese are the second-largest group of foreigners, after [[Chinese people in Korea|Chinese migrants]].&lt;ref name="Immigration.go.kr"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.immigration.go.kr/HP/COM/bbs_003/ListShowData.do?strNbodCd=noti0096&amp;strWrtNo=120&amp;strAnsNo=A&amp;strOrgGbnCd=104000&amp;strRtnURL=IMM_6050&amp;strAllOrgYn=N&amp;strThisPage=1&amp;strFilePath=imm/|chapter=체류외국인 국적별 현황|title={{asiantitle|2013년도 출입국통계연보|||a}}|publisher=Ministry of Justice|publication-place=South Korea|year=2009|accessdate=2011-03-21|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

One of the earliest Vietnamese people in Korea was [[Lý Dương Côn]] (李陽焜), an adopted son of Emperor [[Lý Nhân Tông]]; following a succession crisis, he fled to [[Goryeo]]. He is known in modern-day Korea as an early non-Korean member of the [[Jeongseon|Jeongseon-gun]], [[Gangwon (historical)|Gangwon-do]] ''[[bon-gwan]]'' of the [[Lee (Korean name)|Lee]] family.&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;{{citation|url=http://tuoitre.vn/Chinh-tri-Xa-hoi/Phong-su-Ky-su/172417/800-nam-hoai-co-huong.html|title=Đi tìm dòng họ Lý ở Hàn Quốc: 800 năm hoài cố hương (Looking for the Lee family in Korea)|author=Trung Nghia|periodical=Tuoi Tre |date=2006-11-14|accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a Vietnamese prince of the [[Lý Dynasty]], [[Lý Long Tường]] (the seventh son of emperor [[Lý Anh Tông]]) and his crew of several thousand mandarins and servants escaped directly to Korea after hearing that the Lý Dynasty would be overthrown by the [[Trần Dynasty]]. [[Lý Anh Tông]] and his crew sought refuge in the great Goryeo Kingdom in 1226. A report on [[Lý Long Tường]] was broadcast by the South Korean TV channel [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] in December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kelly|first=Tim|date=2006-09-18|title=Ho Chi Minh Money Trail|periodical=Forbes|url=http://members.forbes.com/global/2006/0918/028.html|accessdate=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Legend has it that King [[Gojong of Goryeo]] (1213–1259) had dreamt of a phoenix flying from the south landing in his nation; therefore, he ordered the local government of [[Haeju]], [[Hwanghae]] to allow the Vietnamese refugees permission to live in a manor in the nearby countryside. The same phoenix gave certain Vietnamese people to go from Vietnamese to Korean if they had wished. [[Lý Long Tường]] thus became the patriarch of the [[Lee (Korean name)|Lee]] family of [[Hwasan]], [[Ongjin, South Hwanghae|Ongjin-gun]].&lt;ref name="TT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://article.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.asp?total_id=2858015&amp;cloc=olink|periodical=JoongAng Ilbo|title=당신의 몸에도 다른 피가 흐른다|date=2007-08-20|accessdate=2010-01-14|author=Yi Hun-beom|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713120754/http://article.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.asp?total_id=2858015&amp;cloc=olink|archive-date=2011-07-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North Korea==

Students from the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] began going to [[North Korea]] to study as early as the 1960s, even before the formal establishment of Korean-language education in their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://newsletter.kf.or.kr/english/contents.asp?vol=51&amp;lang=English&amp;no=545|title=Korean Studies in Vietnam|journal=Korea Foundation Newsletter|date=February 2005|volume=14|issue=1|last=Le|first=Quang Thiem|accessdate=2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Vietnamese ambassador to South Korea is a graduate of [[Kim Il-sung University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://article.joins.com/article/article.asp?total_id=442471|title=`우리는 김일성대학 동문 사이`|periodical=JoongAng Ilbo|date=2005-01-27|accessdate=2007-07-09|last=Choe|first=Won-gi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of a former staff member in the Vietnamese embassy in [[Pyongyang]], who also attended Kim Il-sung University between 1998 and 2002, gave an interview in 2004 with [[Newspapers of South Korea|South Korean newspaper]] ''[[The Chosun Ilbo]]'' about the experiences he had while living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=The Chosun Ilbo|date=2004-10-05|title=김일성大 베트남 유학생이 본 북한}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Korea==

Vietnamese migration to South Korea began later, but quickly grew to a much larger scale; their population consists mainly of migrant workers and women introduced to local husbands through marriage agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Nguyen|first=Nhu|year=1999|title=The Reality: Vietnamese Migrant Workers in South Korea|location=Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam|publisher=Mobility Research and Support Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, 20,493 [[guest worker|labour migrants]] went from [[Vietnam]] to South Korea on traineeship visas; by 1997, this had risen by about 10% to 22,325. Migrants were mostly male and unskilled; they were employed in small and medium-sized companies in labour-intensive industries such as fishing and manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Migration in the Asia Pacific: Population, Settlement and Citizenship Issues|last=Iredale|first=Robin R.|author2=Castles, Stephen|author3= Hawksley, Charles|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Cheltenham, United Kingdom|year=2003|isbn=1-84064-860-0|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mail-order bride|Spousal migration]] has a somewhat longer history; during the [[Vietnam War]], some of the more than 300,000 [[Military of South Korea|South Korean soldiers]] and civilian support staff stationed in Vietnam married Vietnamese women and brought them back to Korea; however, many of these marriages ended in divorce.&lt;ref name=Kagan&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hamline.edu/~rkagan/Publications_Asian%20Literary%20Views%20on%20Vietnam.html|title=Disarming Memories: Japanese, Korean and American Literature on the Vietnam War|publisher=Hamline University|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|last=Kagan|first=Richard C.|access-date=2008-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201111114/http://www.hamline.edu/~rkagan/Publications_Asian%20Literary%20Views%20on%20Vietnam.html|archive-date=2008-12-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spousal migration would not become a large-scale phenomenon until the 1990s, when South Korean men, who outnumber South Korean women by about 8%, began to turn to marriage agencies to seek brides in overseas countries, including Vietnam.

A '''violent crime''' or '''crime of violence''' is a [[crime]] in which an offender or perpetrator uses or threatens to use force upon a victim. This entails both crimes in which the [[violence|violent]] act is the objective, such as murder or rape, as well as crimes in which violence is the means to an end. Violent crimes may, or may not, be committed with weapons. Depending on the jurisdiction, violent crimes may vary from homicide to harassment. Typically, violent criminals includes [[aircraft hijacking|aircraft hijackers]], [[bank robbers]], [[Robbery|muggers]], [[burglars]], [[terrorists]], [[carjackers]], [[rapists]], [[kidnappers]], [[torture]]rs, [[active shooter]]s, [[murderers]], [[gangsters]], [[drug cartels]], and others.

==Violent crime by country==

The comparison of violent [[crime statistics]] between countries is usually problematic, due to the way different countries classify crime.&lt;ref name=eurosb2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segessenmann, Tanya [http://www.justice.govt.nz/pubs/reports/2002/intl-comparisons-crime/section-2.html Section 2 - International Comparisons of Recorded Violent Crime Rates for 2000], Research &amp; Evaluation Unit, Ministry of Justice, Wellington, New Zealand. 11 June 2002 Retrieved 23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Compiling-and-comparing-International-Crime-Statistics.html |title=Compiling and Comparing International Crime Statistics |publisher=Unodc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Crime_statistics |title=Crime statistics - Statistics Explained |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valid comparisons require that similar [[crime|offence]]s between jurisdictions be compared. Often this is not possible, because crime statistics aggregate equivalent offences in such different ways that make it difficult or impossible to obtain a valid comparison. Depending on the jurisdiction, violent crimes may include: [[homicide]], [[murder]], [[assault]], [[manslaughter]], [[sexual assault]], [[rape]], [[robbery]], [[negligence]], [[endangerment]], [[kidnapping]] (abduction), [[extortion]], and [[harassment]]. Different countries also have different systems of recording and reporting crimes.

===Australia===
The first annual national survey of crime victimization in Australia, the Crime Victimisation Survey, was conducted in 2008-09.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4530.0main+features100022012-13 |title=Crime Victimisation, Australia, 2012-13 |author=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=2014-02-11 |website=abs.gov.au |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal crimes included in the survey are: 
*Physical assault
*Threatened assault (including face-to-face and non face-to-face)
*Robbery (including attempted)
*Sexual assault (including attempted)

In 2009, the Australian Standard Offence Classification (ASOC), which had no single category for violent crime, was replaced by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC). The ANZSOC also has no single category for violent crime, but the first 6 of its divisions involve offenses committed against a person: 
#Homicide and related offences;
#Acts intended to cause injury;
#Sexual assault and related offences;
#Dangerous or negligent acts endangering persons;
#Abduction, harassment and other offences against the person;
#Robbery, extortion and related offences.

Canada conducts an annual measure of crime incidences called the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=3302 |title=Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013-07-24 |website=statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Canada.gc.ca |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UCR "Violent ''Criminal Code''" violations include: homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, assault, robbery, criminal harassment, uttering threats, and other violent violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/legal50a-eng.htm |title=Crimes, by type of violation, and by province and territory |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013-07-25 |website=statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Canada.gc.ca |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada also collects information on crime victimization every five years via its General Social Survey on Victimisation (GSS). Among the eight GSS crimes tracked are three violent crimes: sexual assault, robbery, and physical assault.&lt;ref name=CVC2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2010002/article/11340-eng.htm?fpv=2693 |title=Criminal victimization in Canada, 2009 |last1=Perreault |first1=Samuel |last2=Brennan |first2=Shannon |date=2013-05-31 |website=statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Canada.gc.ca |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, England, Latvia, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece and Sweden count minor violence like slapping another person as assault.&lt;ref name=eurosb2010&gt;[http://www.europeansourcebook.org/ob285_full.pdf European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics – 2010], fourth edition, p30.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the case of Ilias Kasidiaris in 2012. Kasidaris, then spokesperson for Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party, slapped a left-wing female opponent in the face during a live televised debate. He was subsequently wanted by Greek prosecutors for assault and faced an arrest warrant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18352258 Greek far-right Golden Dawn MP wanted for assault]. BBC.co.uk. June 7, 2012. Retrieved November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

France does not count minor violence like slapping somebody as assault.&lt;ref name=eurosb2010/&gt;

The United Kingdom includes all [[violence]] against the person, [[sexual offence]]s, as violent crime.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Today violent crimes are considered the most heinous whereas historically, according to Simon Dedo, crimes against property were equally important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dedo |first=Simon |title=When Theft Was Worse Than Murder |url=http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/when-theft-was-worse-than-murder |date=2014-04-24 |work=Nautilus |publisher= |accessdate=2014-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of violent crime in the UK are recorded by the [[British Crime Survey]]. For the 2010/2011 report on crime in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home Office |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb1011 |title=British Crime Survey |publisher=Homeoffice.gov.uk |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2013-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the statistics show that violent crime continues a general downward trend observed over the last few decades as shown in the graph. "The 2010/11 BCS showed overall violence was down 47 per cent on the level seen at its peak in 1995; representing nearly two million fewer violent offences per year." In 2010/11, 31 people per 1000 interviewed reported being a victim of violent crime in the 12 preceding months. Regarding murder, "increasing levels of homicide (at around 2% to 3% per year) [have been observed] from the 1960s through to the end of the twentieth century". Recently the murder rate has declined, "a fall of 19 per cent in homicides since 2001/02", as measured by The Homicide Index.

There are two main crime databases maintained by the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ): the Bureau of Justice Statistics' [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's [[Uniform Crime Report]] (UCR). Non-fatal violence is reported in the NCVS, which measures [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]], [[robbery]], and [[Aggravated assault|aggravated]] and simple [[assault]] reported by households surveyed by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]].&lt;ref name=BJSNCVS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&amp;iid=245 |title=Bureau of Justice Statistics: National Crime Victimization Survey |website=bjs.gov |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCR tracks similar non-fatal violence, plus [[murder]] and non-negligent [[manslaughter]] recorded by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=FBIUCR-Violent&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/violent-crime/violent-crime |title=FBI: Violent Crime |website=fbi.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant methodological and definitional differences between the NCVS and UCR:
*The NCVS includes estimates of both reported and unreported crimes, while the UCR collects data on crimes recorded by the police.
*The UCR includes homicide, arson, and commercial crimes, while the NCVS does not.
*The UCR excludes simple assault (attacks or attempted attacks without a weapon resulting in either no injury or minor injury) and sexual assault, which are in the NCVS.
*The NCVS data are estimates from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households, but the UCR data are based on the actual counts of offenses reported by law enforcement.
*The NCVS excludes crimes against children under 12 years, persons in institutions, and, possibly, highly mobile populations and the homeless; however, victimizations against these persons may be included in the UCR.
Since they use different methodologies and measure overlapping, but not identical, crimes, the data are complementary and not necessarily congruent.&lt;ref name=BJSCStats2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv12.pdf |title=Criminal Victimization, 2012 |last1=Truman |first1=Jennifer |last2=Langton |first2=Lynn |last3= |first3= |date=October 2013 |website=bjs.gov |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

In October 2013, the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS) reported that violent crime (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault) rates for U.S. residents aged 12 and older increased in 2012 for the second consecutive year. The overall rate rose from 22.6 victimizations per 1,000 persons in 2011 to 26.1 in 2012. Most of the increase was in simple assaults.&lt;ref name=BJSCStats2012/&gt;{{rp|1}} From 1993 to 2012, overall violent victimization declined by two-thirds, from a rate of 79.8 per 1,000 to 26.1 per 1,000.&lt;ref name=BJSCStats2012/&gt;{{rp|6}}

In 2011, the UCR violent crime rate had dropped to 386.3 cases per 100,000 persons, compared to 729.6 per 100,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=Statista2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/191219/reported-violent-crime-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/ |title=Reported violent crime rate in the United States from 1990 to 2012 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 2013 |website=statista.com |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-15 }} Using FBI data.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. homicide data is also available in the [[National Vital Statistics System]] (NVSS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1755">The '''Western Apoi tribe''' of the [[Ijaw people]] live in [[Ondo State]], [[Nigeria]]. The tribe (also called Ijaw Apoi or Apoi) consists of nine settlements: Igbobini, Ojuala, Ikpoki, Inikorogha, Oboro, Shabomi, Igbotu, Kiribo and Gbekebo. The Apoi inhabited higher ground than most of the other Ijaw tribes. They speak the [[Yoruba language]] as they no longer speak the Ijaw language. They are bordered to the north by the [[Ikale]] [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and to the west by the [[Ilaje]] Yoruba. The clan also shares border with the [[Arogbo clan|Arogbo]] Ijaw to the south and the [[Furupagha]] Ijaw to the east across the Siluko River.&lt;ref&gt;Alagoa, Ebiegberi Joe (2005). ''A History of the Niger Delta'', Port Harcourt: Onyoma Research Publications. {{ISBN|978-37314-5-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apoi people trace their origin to a migration from the Central [[Niger Delta]] in present day [[Bayelsa State]]. Prior to arriving at their present location, tribal traditions recall a long period of settlement at Ukomu in what is now [[Furupagha tribe|Furupagha]] territory.

The Apoi king is called Oba and the title is Kalasuwe and the seat of the throne is in Shabomi.

Here is the list of Apoi Kings, and the communities they rule over.:
* Kalasuwe of Apoi Land - Oba (Prof.) Sunday Adejimola Amuseghan
* Olu of Igbobini - Oba Oyedele Raphael
* Odogun of Igbekebo - Oba E.O. Egbukuyomi
* Gbaluwe of Igbotu - Oba Adeniyi Ajayi
* Niyon of Kiribo - Oba F.A. Omosegbon
* Takunbe of ikpoke - Oba Moses Omomofe Olomu
* Jowe of Inikorogha - Oba M.A. Olasehinde
* Ibini of Ojuala - Oba Olatunbosun-Luyi
* Okiribiti of Sabomi - Vacant
