      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5561">"'''A Causal Theory of Knowing'''" is a philosophical essay written by [[Alvin Goldman]] in 1967, published in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]''. It is based on existing theories of knowledge in the realm of [[epistemology]], the study of philosophy through the scope of knowledge. The essay attempts to define knowledge by connecting facts, beliefs and knowledge through underlying and connective series called causal chains. It provides a '''causal theory of knowledge'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

A [[causal chain]] is repeatedly described as a sequence of events for which one event in a chain causes the next. According to Goldman, these chains can only exist with the presence of an accepted fact, a belief in the fact, and a cause for the subject to believe the fact.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay also explores the ideas of perception and memory through the use of the causal chains and the concept of knowledge.

==Background==
The essay is regarded as an improvement and rebuttal of [[Edmund Gettier|Edmund Gettier's]] "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", which is one of many attempts to explain the necessary conditions for knowledge to develop. Goldman implements the causal connection to reiterate his own theory of knowledge. Knowledge exists, says Goldman, if and only if the belief is justified by a reaction to the accepted fact.

Goldman's theory later counters that of Michael Clark, stating that his own theory including figures and diagrams is more appropriate than Clark's. "A Causal Theory of Knowing" uses figures which make explicit references to causal beliefs. Clark's model does not utilize these arrows, and Goldman states that the lack of these arrows deems Clark's model deficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
[[Alvin Goldman]], currently a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Rutgers University]], wrote "A Causal Theory of Knowing" when he was in his late twenties. Goldman received his Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]], and has taught at numerous universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|Professional Biography|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman's research deals mainly with epistemology and other cognitive sciences. "A Causal Theory of Knowing" was Goldman's first published paper explaining his own views of epistemology. Currently, Goldman has written more than ten essays focusing on knowledge and cognitive science.

==Contents==
The essay starts with a definition of Gettier's theory, followed by multiple reiterations of the idea of causal connections, figures to explain knowledge through a visual perspective, and references to [[perception]] and [[memory]] through causal chains.

The essay tends to focus on examples in which knowledge or other sensations do not exist, rather than proving a certain fact to be known.  Goldman also states on multiple occasions that he does not wish to explain the causal process in detail, instead pointing out counterexamples.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At numerous times in the essay, he also points out that he does not intend to give definitive answers to each of the propositions mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman also refocuses the idea of [[perception]], or knowledge through sensation (specifically sight) using his own theory of knowing. The concept of causal perception indicates that one observes something only if the object itself causes the sensation of sight to be accepted as known.  Thus, the object's existence must be factual and one must believe its existence. While all knowledge comes from facts, inferred knowledge emerges when physical object facts cause sense data which can be perceived as senses. The sense data can also be used to make conclusions, known as inferred knowledge, about certain physical object facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|pp=358–359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From "A Causal Theory of Knowing", Goldman constructs the idea that [[memory]] is also a causal process. Memory is explained as being an extension of knowledge into the future, and remembering is the act of recalling a fact that has already been known.  Further, the theory states that if knowledge is forgotten at one time, it cannot be considered a memory in the future. According to Goldman, if a fact is known at Time 1 but forgotten at Time 2, and then at Time 3 that the fact is perceived again but not known, at Time 3 the original fact is not a memory because there is no causal connection between the fact and the memory.

Newton is a graduate of [[Haverford College]] and has a Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]] (1992). While at Harvard, his book, ''Narrative ethics'', "sought a bridge between the disciplines of [[Ethics|ethical philosophy]] and literary studies by proposing a new way to think about the moral realms of risk and responsibility as problems of reading." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yucommentator.com/news/2007/09/04/Features/Fresh.Faces-2944273.shtml |publisher=The Commentator, Official Newspaper of Yeshiva College and the Sy Syms School of Business |title=Fresh Faces |work=2007-09-04 Interview |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He defines narrative ethics as "the ethical consequences of narrating story... and the reciprocal claims binding teller, listener, witness, and reader in that process."&lt;ref&gt;Ballaster, R.

The '''Afro-Shirazi Party''' (ASP) was the union between the mostly [[Shirazi (ethnic group)|Shirazi]] Shiraz Party and the mostly [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] Afro Party in the island of [[Zanzibar]]. The formation of ASP led to the ouster of the Arabs from power with the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] in 1964. The party joined with the [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU) to form [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM) in January 1977.

'''Antun Bauer''' (February 11, 1856 – December 7, 1937) was a Yugoslav theologian and philosopher who served as [[Archbishop of Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=6326 |contribution=Bauer, Antun |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=February 18, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Breznica, Croatia]], hailing from a family of [[Burgenland Croats]]. He studied in Zagreb, Budapest and Vienna, where he received his PhD in philosophy and theology in 1883. He was ordained in 1879. After returning from his studies, for a time was a chaplain in Zagreb, Ivanec and Samobor, and afterwards he worked for a few years in Zagreb as a catechist in the male teachers' training college and high school. In 1887 he was transferred to the Faculty of Theology, where he worked at first as a lecturer, then as an associate, and since 1904 as a full professor of philosophy and basic theology. In 1905–1906 and 1906–1907 he served as the Dean of the Theological Faculty, and in the period 1906–1907 as the Rector of the [[University of Zagreb]]. Since 1896 was an associate, and since in 1899 full member of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (from 1915 to his death also a sponsor).&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

In 1911 he was appointed coadjutor to Archbishop [[Juraj Posilović]]. On April 26, 1914 he took the management of the [[Zagreb Archdiocese]]. He was an editor (1886–1890) and a longtime collaborator of ''Katolički list'' and many other Catholic newsletters. In the period of 1885–1911 he was elected as a representative for five times, which enabled him to actively participate in the work of the [[Croatian Parliament]]. At first he was a member of the Party of Rights (''Stranka prava''), and afterward as a representative of ''Matica stranke prava'', i.e. ''Udružena opozicija'' ("United Opposition"), and finally as a representative of the [[Croatian Party of Rights]], whence he approached the [[Croatian-Serbian Coalition]].&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

As an Archbishop, Bauer mainly dealt with church affairs. At his instigation and under his presidency the [[Croatian Bishops' Conference]] was established in 1918. In 1925 he organized the first synod of the Archdiocese of Zagreb (after 1690). In 1922 he participated in the work of the Commission for the preparation of the concordat. He is also credited for turning the [[Institute of St. Jerome]] into a national institution. Together with Đokovo bishop [[Antun Akšamović]] he built a seminary and high school in Zagreb. He also helped the reestablishment of [[Caritas International|Caritas]] in Croatia.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

In the period of up to the 1914 Bauer has established himself as a prolific philosophical writer. In his philosophical and theological works he advocated the [[Neo-Thomist]] interpretation of metaphysics.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

He died in [[Zagreb]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3305">'''Class collaboration''' is a principle of social organization based upon the belief that the division of society into a hierarchy of [[social class]]es is a positive and essential aspect of [[civilization]].

==Fascist views==
Class collaboration is one of the main pillars of social architecture in [[fascism]]. In the words of [[Benito Mussolini]], fascism "affirms the irremediable, fruitful and beneficent inequality of men."&lt;ref name = "Mussolini"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1932|title=The Doctrine of Fascism| encyclopedia = [[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|publisher=''Istituto Giovanni Treccani''|location=[[Rome]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this premise, fascists conclude that the preservation of social hierarchy is in the interests of all classes, and therefore all classes should [[Collaboration|collaborate]] in its defense. Both the lower and the higher classes should accept their roles and perform their respective duties.

In fascist thought, the principle of class collaboration is combined with strong [[ultranationalism]]. The stability and the prosperity of the nation was seen as the ultimate purpose of collaboration between classes.

==Communist views==
[[Communism|Communists]] are ideologically and fundamentally opposed to class collaboration, advocating for [[class struggle]] and generally favoring a [[classless society]] instead.

Whereas the doctrine of class struggle urges the lower classes to overthrow the ruling class and the existing social order for the purpose of establishing equality, the doctrine of class collaboration urges them to accept inequality as part of the natural state of things and preserve the social order. Furthermore, it holds that the State alone 'reconciles' class antagonisms in society, and that the strife which gives rise to Communism can be harmonized.

Some Marxists use the term "class collaboration" as a pejorative term describing working class organisations that do not pursue [[class struggle]]. In this [[word sense|sense]] the term echoes the [[connotation]]s of [[collaborationism]].

At the same time, however, communists do not necessarily reject all alliances between classes. Some communists argue that, in a country with a large peasant population, the transition to communism can be accomplished by an alliance between two classes, the [[peasant]]ry and the [[proletariat]], united against the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1923/jan/23.htm|title=How We Should Reorganise the Wokers' and Peasants' Inspection|date=January 23, 1923|author=V. I. Lenin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[New Democracy]] concept calls for "the peasantry, the proletariat, the petty bourgeoisie and national and patriotic elements from the bourgeoisie to collectively operate for the building of a socialist society".

'''David Oswald Thomas''' (4 March 1924 &amp;ndash; 28 May 2005) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] philosopher, best known as an interpreter of the work of [[Richard Price]].

Thomas was born in [[Rhuthun]], Denbighshire, the son of the Clerk to the Department of Education for the county.  He was educated at [[Denbigh]] Grammar School, after which he worked as a bank clerk. In 1943, after two years in the bank, he joined the RAF. He served until 1946. Stationed for most of the time in the Middle East, he served one and a half years in Iraq. At the end of his service he took advantage of a scheme for demobilizing into university and studied philosophy at the University College of Wales, Bangor. His student days were marked by the onset of [[ankylosing spondylitis]].  After completing his degree, Thomas studied the [[British idealism|British idealists]] for his MA, and then moved from Bangor to London where, for his PhD, he studied the political philosophy of [[Richard Price]]. His choice of subject had been influenced by the publication in 1948 of D.D. Raphael's new edition of Price's ''A Review of the Principal Questions in Morals'', first published 190 years earlier.  He was successively Tutor in Philosophy and Psychology at [[Coleg Harlech]] 1955-60; Lecturer in Philosophy, [[Aberystwyth University|UCW Aberystwyth]] 1960-67, Senior Lecturer 1967-79, Reader 1979-83.  In 1965, he married Dr Beryl Jones, with whom he had one daughter, Janet.  Thomas died in [[Aberystwyth]] on 28 May 2005.

Dr. Thomas made Richard Price, the eighteenth-century Welsh philosopher and polymath, his life's work. In 1977 he published the definitive study of Price, ''The Honest Mind''.  This was followed by the complete correspondence of Price, which he produced in collaboration with Bernard Peach of [[Duke University]], and with the assistance of his wife, Beryl Thomas.

Thomas felt that thinkers like Price had received insufficient attention and wished to encourage studies in that area.  In 1977, in collaboration with Dr. Martin FitzPatrick, he began the ''Price-Priestley Newsletter'', which in 1982, matured into the journal ''Enlightenment and Dissent''. The journal itself fulfilled his expectations, publishing major articles on eighteenth-century thought including special issues on [[Samuel Clarke]] and ''Enlightenment, Religion, Science and Popular Culture''.

Thomas had a special ability to combine philosophical insight with historical understanding. Immune to fashionable trends in the history of philosophy and of ideas, he was critical of the concept of paradigms of thought associated with the work of [[J. G. A. Pocock]].  He preferred the notion of traditions, yet was also insistent that traditions of thought should not be viewed as mutually exclusive.  His own method enabled him to analyse philosophical problems as they appeared to eighteenth-century writers and at the same time to indicate how those problems might still pose difficulties for us today. His examination of the conflict between Price and Edmund Burke in The Honest Mind is a fine example of his approach. He identified the essential differences between the two thinkers while also demonstrating that Burke's attack on Price was founded, at least in part, on a misunderstanding of Price's political principles.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fitzpatrick and W. Bernard Peach; ''Enlightenment and Dissent''; Aberystwyth; 19, 2000, vii-xiii; and 21, 2002 vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Derech HaShem''''' (The "Way of God") is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] text written in the 1730s by Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]].  It systematizes the basic principles of [[Judaism|Jewish]] belief regarding the [[existence of God]], God's purpose in [[Creation myth|creation]], and the [[logical consequence]] of other concepts in Judaism. The reader is led from thought to idea, from idea to a logical whole of the structure of Jewish belief. 

Presented from a [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] perspective, yet presupposing no prior knowledge and without the use of Kabbalistic terminology, this work provides a foundation for understanding the [[worldview]] and ideas found in the ''[[Zohar]]'', the writings of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]] the ''Ari'zal'' and other Kabbalistic works.  

The book is organized into four main sections: the general basis of all existence, God's Divine Providence, [[prophecy]], and religious observance.

The '''Detroit Black Community Food Security Network''' (DBCFSN) is an urban, community-oriented, predominantly black, [[grassroots]] [[Food Justice Movement|food justice]] group.&lt;ref name="dbfs"&gt;Detroit Black Food Security Network . (n.d.). Retrieved February 15, 2018, from https://detroitblackfoodsecurity.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was initiated by a communal desire to start an [[organic garden]] collective, and has grown from its founding in 2006 with over 50 [[Detroit]] residents as members.&lt;ref name="fivedecades"&gt;Pothukuchi, K.

The goal of the organization is to increase food security and [[sovereignty]] within Detroit’s black population. It formulates efforts to provide communal access to spaces where food is healthy, available, and affordable. DBCFSN uses community activism, alliance building and educational programs to highlight various structures which perpetuate the inequality of black communities in present-day Detroit.&lt;ref name="Agyeman, J. 2014"&gt;Agyeman, J., &amp; McEntee, J.

==History==
===Pretext for founding===
Following the 1950s city demolition of [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] and Paradise Valley for highway construction, the residents of Detroit increased the presence of the [[Black Power movement|Black Power Movement]], and the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], throughout the 1960's.&lt;ref name="fivedecades"/&gt;  By 1967, Pastor [[Albert Cleage]], founder of the Central United Church of Christ, later named the Shrines of the Black Madonna of the Pan-African Orthodox Christian Church, founded the Black Star Market, the first black communal cooperative business.&lt;ref name="fivedecades"/&gt; The [[Cooperative|co-op]] closed within two years, but started forming the framework for much of DBCFSN’s work. Mayor [[Coleman Young]] of Detroit developed and implemented the Farm-A-Lot program in 1975 to encourage [[urban agriculture]] in the city, but the impact of this effort faded at the turn of the century.&lt;ref name="fivedecades"/&gt;

Outside and foreign investors, [[white flight]], and the collapse of the automobile industry have made it difficult for local Detroit residents to own land, a reflection of the trend since 1910 of African American land ownership.&lt;ref name="guzman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sisters"&gt;White, M. M. (2011). Sisters of the Soil: Urban Gardening as Resistance in Detroit. Race/Ethnicity: Multidisciplinary Global Contexts, 5(1), 13-28. doi:10.2979/racethmulglocon.5.1.13&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s of Detroit maintained a trend of supermarket closures, with [[Farmer Jack]], the last chain grocery store in Detroit in 2007.&lt;ref name="guzman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="environmental"&gt;White, M.

After the country-wide recession struck, Detroit's depression worsened, which resulted in increases in unemployment, crime, and poverty levels.&lt;ref name="White, M. M. 2010"/&gt;

===Founding===
In 2000, Malik Yakini, principal of Nsoroma Institute Public School Academy charter school, worked with staff, parents and supporters (including Anan Lololi of the Afr-Can Food Basket) to implement organic gardening and to develop a food security curriculum.&lt;ref name="yakini"&gt;Wallace, H. (2016, March 28). Malik Yakini of Detroit's Black Community Food Security Network. Retrieved March 27, 2018, from https://civileats.com/2011/12/19/tft-interview-malik-yakini-of-detroits-black-community-food-security-network/&lt;/ref&gt; The garden grew to form the Shamba Organic Garden Collective (SOGC), where faculty and parents plotted and maintained 20 gardens in backyards and vacant lots.&lt;ref name="yakini"/&gt; "Groundbreakers" took on the role of tilling gardens for community members who were unable to do so. The founding meeting of DBCFSN occurred in 2006 when Yakini assembled a group of 40 community members strongly connected to food at the Black Star Community Bookstore.&lt;ref name="fivedecades"/&gt;&lt;ref name="environmental"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yakini"/&gt; This would have not been possible without the organizations effect in influencing public policy.&lt;ref name="yakini"/&gt; People such as JoAnne Watson and council man Kwame Kenyatta were crucial characters in connecting this cause to the people within the Detroit City Council who eventually approved the food security policy.&lt;ref name="yakini"/&gt; The specific policy in which DBCFSN is particularly concerned is "the Right to Farm act." This states no higher power has authority to create laws and regulate agriculture in their area.&lt;ref name="yakini"/&gt; This is an important case for DBCFS because they need to refrain from breaking any laws and regulations while carrying out the mission to develop healthy urban agricultural systems.&lt;ref name="yakini"/&gt;

The group discussed the need for black community [[involvement]] in urban agriculture, as well as food justice, security and sovereignty.&lt;ref name="environmental"/&gt; The newfound Detroit Black Community Food Security Network began gardening on a quarter-acre plot of land in Detroit’s east side, quickly moving to a half-acre plot in Detroit’s westside. In 2008, DBCFSN secured a long-term lease on seven acres of property in [[River Rouge (Michigan)|Rouge]] Park, establishing D-Town Farm as the city’s largest community run farm.&lt;ref name="fivedecades"/&gt; Currently, DBCFSN operates the D-Town Farm, The Food Warriors Youth Development Program (under the leadership of Education and Outreach Director Hanifa Adjuman) and is opening the Detroit People's Food Cooperative in 2019.&lt;ref name="dbfs"/&gt;

==Structure of DBCFSN==
Detroit Black Community Food Security Network has more than 70 members, of which 80% are women, including individuals, seven families, and one organization.&lt;ref name="environmental"/&gt; The D-Town Farm maintains one full-time employee, five part‐time farmers, and around ten internships annually.&lt;ref&gt;Richtr, J., &amp; Potteiger, M.

(n.d.). Farming as a Tool of urban rebirth?

Members of DBCFSN generally identify with [[Black nationalism|Black Nationalism]] and political analysis from the [[Black Power Movement]], and have been engaged with community involvement in prior experiences.&lt;ref name="sisters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="environmental"/&gt;

===Executive Director===
Malik Yakini, the primary co-founder of DBCFSN and the Executive Director of the organization, handles the daily operations of the organization.&lt;ref name="fivedecades"/&gt; His experience promoting food justice in the African-centered charter school Nsoroma Institute Public School Academy in Detroit provided a platform for community engagement and education.&lt;ref name="yakini"/&gt; His work as a black liberation activist and bookstore owner has made him popular among Detroit's black residents.&lt;ref&gt;White, M.

Indiana University Press. Retrieved March 4, 2018, from Project MUSE database.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Detroit community, he is known as an urban farming pioneer, as well as an advocate for the urban agricultural movement.&lt;ref name="guzman"/&gt; Additionally, he is an educator, he teaches topics such as African history and culture, sustainable agriculture, and systems of oppression including [[white supremacy]], [[capitalism]], and [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name="fivedecades"/&gt; His work is directed to guide and inspire members of the community to join in the drive to build more localized urban agricultural systems for struggling Detroit community members.&lt;ref name="yakini"/&gt;

===Board of Directors and staff===
The Board of Directors for DBCFSN includes Albert Seevers, Shakara Tyler, Nikolette Barnes, Ndidika Vernon and Charles Needham.&lt;ref name="dbfs"/&gt; This board determine the organizational policies of DBCFSN and appoints the Executive Director.&lt;ref name="environmental"/&gt; Nikolette Barnes is also on the staff of Keep Growing Detroit, an organization that promotes the growth and production of urban gardening throughout Detroit. The organization works closely with efforts similar to those of the DBCFSN, urging community members to think proactively about the sources of their food, and encouraging the support of local gardening efforts. Similar to the DBSFSN, Keep Growing Detroit also includes educational efforts, such as youth programs, which aim to provide more information about food sovereignty to the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://detroitagriculture.net/|title=Keep Growing Detroit|last=|first=|date=|website=Keep Growing Detroit|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizations work simultaneously towards the same goal, which is to increase efforts of community engagement combating food insecurity.

===Membership information===
There are three levels of membership in DBCFSN: an individual membership which is $10 in annual dues, a family membership which is $25, and an organizational membership which costs $120.&lt;ref name="dbfs"/&gt; All of the money supports DBCFSN’s community work, and members are eligible for D-Town farm produce discounts. Membership meetings are held monthly at the DBCFSN office (11000 W McNichols, Suite 103, Detroit, MI 48221). This membership connects people through the Detroit People's Food Co-op. This Co-op is a part of DBCFN's community development complex known as the Detroit Food Commons.&lt;ref name="dbfs"/&gt; A significant community development project that connects the local community to a large amount of resources to better themselves and their knowledge and well-being.&lt;ref name="dbfs"/&gt;

==Framework==
DBCFSN extends the legacy of the Black Freedom Movement, attributing foundational ideas to those of [[Ida B. Wells]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Fannie Lou Hamer|Fannie Lou Hammer]], Rev. [[Albert Cleage|Albert B. Cleage]] and others .&lt;ref name="Fernandez, M. 2012"&gt;Fernandez, M., Goodall, K., Olson, M., &amp; Mendez, E. (2012).

==Land ownership==

===2006-2008===
Upon their formation, DBCFSN acquired use of a quarter acre plot of land near the 4-H Club on McClellan in the Eastside of Detroit in 2006, and the land was purchased by a developer in the fall of that year. In June 2007, the organization acquired use of a half acre plot of land owned by the Pan African Orthodox Christian Church.&lt;ref name="dbfs"/&gt;

===2008: $1 lease===
After 2 years of planning and meetings with the Detroit City Council and the City Planning and Recreation Department, DBCFSN acquired a temporary 10-year license agreement to use a designated 2 acre site in the City of Detroit's Meyers' Tree Nursery in Rouge Park for $1 annually.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, L.

Malik Yakini and DBCFSN are currently working on a project named the Detroit Food Commons Project. It will be 30,000 square feet, and will feature the Detroit People's Food Co-op mentioned above, a local cafe, kitchen, and meeting rooms for DBCFSN and the local community.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/peoples-food-coop-north-end-011518.aspx|title=A Co-op for the people: The rocky process of developing the Detroit People's Food Co-op|last=|first=|date= January 15, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/table-and-bar/archives/2018/01/16/huge-new-food-co-op-food-commons-are-planned-for-detroits-north-end|title=Huge new food co-op, 'food commons' are planned for Detroit's North End|last=Perkins|first=Tom|date= January 16, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dbcfsn.org/detroit-people-s-food-co-op|title=Detroit People's Food Co-op|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the project is so grand-scale, there has been some difficulties getting it together.

== Community outreach and engagement ==

===Food Warriors Youth Development Program===
DBCFSN established the Food Warriors Youth Development Program as an African-centered program for young people between 5 – 12 years of age, that seeks to educate Detroit youth on food, where it comes from, and how to grow it locally and sustainably.&lt;ref name="michigannightlight.com"&gt;Adjuman, H. (2013, December 2). Food Warriors [Interview]. Retrieved March 27, 2018, from http://www.michigannightlight.com/programs/foodwarriors.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of an after-school program at Timbuktu Academy of Science and Technology and a Saturday Community Food Warriors Program at the Pan African Orthodox Christian Church.&lt;ref name="dbfs"/&gt; Children are provided with tools to develop their own sense of agency by learning how to plant, tend, and harvest a garden and how healthy eating is connected to the health of their overall community. The program also strives to de-stigmatize the connection many people have between agriculture and African Americans.&lt;ref name="michigannightlight.com"/&gt; What really sets the Food Warriors initiative apart is their seven principles of Nguzo Saba. This is a set of core values that signify the importance of strengthening the family, community and the African centered paradigm.&lt;ref name="michigannightlight.com"&gt;Adjuman, H. (2013, December 2). Food Warriors [Interview]. Retrieved March 27, 2018, from http://www.michigannightlight.com/programs/foodwarriors.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==="What's For Dinner" lecture series===
The "What's For Dinner" lecture series is hosted by DBCFSN through the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History annually during the months of April, June, August and October.&lt;ref name="dbfs"/&gt; The lectures are free and open to the public, and they concentrate on issues within the food system with intentions of informing the Detroit public. Previous lecturers at these events include Dr. Jessica B. Harriss, Cashawn Meyers and Anthony Hatinger.&lt;ref&gt;2015 "What's for Dinner?" Lecture Series Kick-off. (April 18, 2015).

==Political involvement==
The roots of DBCFSN trace back to the U.S. [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the Black Power Movement within Detroit.&lt;ref name="Pothukuchi, K. 20152"/&gt; The organization operates under a food sovereignty policy framework, guided by principles including food as a human right, agrarian reform, protection of natural resources, reorganization of food trade, ending hunger, peace and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Piribert, M. 2008. Toward food sovereignty: Reclaiming autonomous food systems. London: IIED&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, chaired by JoAnn Watson, DBCFSN spoke before the Neighborhood and Community Service Standing Committee of the Detroit City Council to implement a food security policy for the city of Detroit.&lt;ref name="dbfs"/&gt;

The Public Policy Committee of DBCFSN presented the draft at a public forum during their September 2007 Harvest Festival. The City Council of Detroit unanimously passed the Detroit Food Security Policy bill on March 25, 2008.&lt;ref name="Pothukuchi, K. 20152"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hungercenter.org"/&gt; The bill includes plans for developing a food system analysis database for Detroit, undertaking data collection on hunger and malnutrition, formulating recommendations for alternative food systems such as urban agriculture, creating citizen education guidelines, and producing an emergency response plan in the event of a natural disaster.&lt;ref name="White, M. M. 2011"/&gt;

==Biography==
Gyuzelov was born in 1902 in [[Dojran|Doyran]], but after the destruction of the city during [[World War I]] his family moved to [[Strumica]]. He finished Serbian high school in that city and then studied philosophy and Slavic studies in the Faculty of Philosophy in Skopje, during which time he was sponsored by [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO).&lt;ref name="IC"/&gt; In 1924 he joined the [[Macedonian Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization]] (MYSRO) shortly after its establishment and initial development, and like this organized  wide activities by forming a nuclei of organization in many cities of Macedonia.

After the occupation of most of the Yugoslav [[Vardar Banovina]] by Bulgaria in 1941, Gyuzelov returned to Vardar Macedonia and became director of [[Radio Skopje]]. After the end of war, the Communist government of [[Yugoslavia]] sentenced him to death by hanging, labeling him like many other prominent [[Macedonian Bulgarians]] as a "Bulgarian fascist". He was shot, together with [[Dimitar Chkatrov]], in the vicinity of Zaychev Rid, three kilometers outside of [[Skopje]].&lt;ref&gt;Църнушанов, Коста. „Македонизмът и съпротивата на Македония срещу него“, Унив. изд.

'''Dominic Bezzina''' (18th/19th centuries) was a minor Maltese philosopher who mainly specialised in [[physics]]. He also dealt with [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, pp. 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
It seems that Bezzina was born around the mid-18th century. After becoming a priest, he taught [[philosophy]] and [[science]] at the Cathedral School at [[Mdina]], [[Malta]]. He was also a Canon at the Bishop’s Cathedral Chapter. Bezzina taught at [[Mdina]] at least since 1819. One of the courses he delivered concerned [[physics]].

==Extant work==
Bezzina’s only extant work is called '''''Institutum Philosophicum''''' (Philosophical Teaching).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 252}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in manuscript form,&lt;ref&gt;Archive of the Archbishop’s Seminary, [[Rabat, Malta]], Misc. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and contains 171 back to back folios. Unfortunately, the document is certainly incomplete. The extant manuscript is just the first part of a larger work. It is not known how many further part the whole work contained.

The extant part of the ''Institutum'' concerns logic. The division is typically that of [[Scholasticism]], organised in books, chapters, and articles. Throughout the work Bezzina discusses the nature and conditions of Aristotelian logic, consciousness, and the genesis of ideas.

'''Ernest Sosa''' (born June 17, 1940) is an American philosopher primarily interested in [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n 79055185}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is Board of Governors [[Professor]] of [[Philosophy]] at [[Rutgers University]] since 2007, but spent most of his career at [[Brown University]].  

== Education and career ==

Born in [[Cárdenas, Cuba]] on June 17, 1940,&lt;ref&gt;The dictionary of modern American philosophers, Volume 1 by Richard T. Hull, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, p.2287.&lt;/ref&gt; Sosa earned his BA and MA from the [[University of Miami]] and his PhD from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1964 where his dissertation was supervised by [[Nicholas Rescher]].

He joined the Rutgers faculty in 2007, having taught previously at [[Brown University]] since 1964.  While full-time at Brown, he was also a distinguished visiting professor at Rutgers every spring from 1998-2006.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mac.com/ernestsosa/Site/CV.html |title=Ernest Sosa - Abbreviated Curriculum Vitae |author=Ernest Sosa |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206155743/http://web.mac.com/ernestsosa/Site/CV.html |archivedate=February 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sosa has been described as "one of the most important epistemologists of the last half-century."&lt;ref&gt;https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23005-ernest-sosa-and-his-critics/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sosa is a past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]] and a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]].&lt;ref name=CV /&gt;  He edits the philosophical journals ''[[Noûs]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/editors.asp?ref=0029-4624&amp;site=1 |title=Noûs - Journal Information |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |year=2010 |accessdate=July 23, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/editors.asp?ref=0031-8205&amp;site=1 |title=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research - Journal Information |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |year=2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he delivered the [[John Locke Lectures]] at Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures/past_lectures|title=Past Lectures - Faculty of Philosophy|accessdate=July 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171436/http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures/past_lectures|archivedate=July 20, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which formed the basis of his 2007 book.

He was also the 2010 recipient of the [[Nicholas Rescher]] Prize for contributions to systematic philosophy, conferred by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] biennially.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.pitt.edu/news/philosopher-ernest-sosa-inaugural-recipient-pitt%E2%80%99s-prestigious-rescher-prize&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, [[David Sosa]], is a professor and chair of the philosophy department at the [[University of Texas, Austin]].

== Philosophy ==

In addition to epistemology, Sosa has also written on [[metaphysics]], [[modern philosophy]] and [[philosophy of mind]].  In his books ''Knowledge in Perspective'' (1991) and ''A Virtue Epistemology'' (2007), Sosa defends a form of [[virtue epistemology]] called "virtue perspectivism", which distinguishes animal knowledge from reflective knowledge.

If it has notable sources, they are probably from other philosophers of science.  Depending on the sources, we might consider mention them in the lead section too, but until we do, the explanations below the picture in the lead section should match the definition given in the lead section. Anyway, the first step is to have these sources. If we don't have them, this statement will have to be rewritten.}} Were the statement true, however, it would be difficult to prove true.]]

A [[proposition|statement]], [[hypothesis]], or [[theory]] has '''falsifiability''' (or is  '''falsifiable''') if it is contradicted by a basic statement, which, in an eventual successful or failed falsification, must respectively correspond to a true or [[hypothetical]] observation.&lt;ref name="twomeanings"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XXII}}: "We must distinguish two meanings of the expressions ''falsifiable'' and ''falsifiability'':&lt;br /&gt;
"1) ''Falsifiable'' as a logical-technical term, in the sense of the demarcation criterion of falsifiability. This purely logical concept — falsifiable in principle, one might say — rests on a logical relation between the theory in question and the class of basic statements (or the potential falsifiers described by them).&lt;br /&gt;
"2) ''Falsifiable'' in the sense that the theory in question can definitively or conclusively or demonstrably be falsified ("demonstrably falsifiable").&lt;br /&gt;
"I have always stressed that even a theory which is obviously falsifiable in the first sense is never falsifiable in this second sense. (For this reason I have used the expression ''falsifiable'' as a rule only in the first, technical sense. In the second sense, I have as a rule spoken not of ''falsifiability'' but rather of ''falsification'' and of its  problems)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reproducibility"&gt;For an actual falsification to occur, the basic statement must be  [[Reproducibility|reproducible]]. See {{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=66}}: "We say that a theory is falsified only if we have accepted basic statements which contradict it (cf. section 11, rule 2). This condition is necessary, but not sufficient; for we have seen that non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science. Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory. In other words, we only accept the falsification if a low-level empirical hypothesis which describes such an effect is proposed and corroborated. This kind of hypothesis may be called a falsifying hypothesis."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the claim "all swans are white" is falsifiable since it is contradicted by this basic statement: "In 1697, during the [[Willem de Vlamingh|Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh]] expedition, there were black swans on the shore of the Swan River in Australia", which in this case is a true observation.&lt;ref&gt;Back in those days it was assumed that everyone (in Europe) believed that swans had to be white {{harv|Life On Perth|2007}}, but this changed, because this basic statement is reproducible: swans can be seen at different times and locations.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="observation"&gt;Popper put as an example of falsifiable statement with failed falsifications  Einstein's [[equivalence principle]]. See {{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XX}}: "Einstein's principle of proportionality of inert and (passively) heavy mass. This equivalence principle '''conflicts with many potential falsifiers: events whose observation is logically possible'''. Yet despite all attempts (the experiments by Eötvös, more recently refined by Rickle) to realize such a falsification experimentally, the experiments have so far corroborated the principle of equivalence."&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is also known by the terms '''refutable''' and '''refutability'''.

The concept was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]].   He saw falsifiability as the logical part and the cornerstone of his scientific [[epistemology]], which sets the limits of scientific inquiry.  He proposed that statements and theories that are not falsifiable are [[unscientific]].  Declaring an unfalsifiable theory to be [[scientific method|scientific]] would then be [[pseudoscience]].{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}

==Overview==
The classical view of the [[philosophy of science]] is that it is the goal of science to prove [[hypotheses]] like "All swans are white" or to [[inductive reasoning|induce]] them from observational data. The [[Inductive reasoning|Inductivist]] methodology supposes that one can somehow move from a series of statements such as 'here is a white swan', 'over there is a white swan', and so on, to a universal statement such as 'all swans are white'. As observed by  [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and later by Popper and others, this method is clearly ''deductively'' invalid, since it is always possible that there may be a non-white swan that has eluded observation&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Popper|1959|p=4}} : "Now it is far from obvious, from a logical point of view, that we are justified in inferring universal statements from singular ones, no matter how numerous; for any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false: no matter how many instances of white swans we may have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that all swans are white."&lt;/ref&gt; (and, in fact, the discovery of the Australian [[black swan]] demonstrated the deductive invalidity of this particular statement). This is known as the [[problem of induction]].

One solution to the problem of induction, proposed by Immanuel Kant in [[Critique of Pure Reason]], is to consider as valid absolutely [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] the conclusions that we would otherwise have drawn from these dubious inferential inductions.&lt;ref&gt;In {{harvnb|Kant|1787|loc=sec II, B4}}: "If, therefore, a judgment is thought with strict universality, i.e., so that no exception at all is allowed to be possible, then it is not derived from experience, but is valid absolutely a priori."&lt;/ref&gt; Following Kant, Popper accepted that we have to work with unproven hypotheses, but he refused that we have to justify them in any way&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=9}}: "According to the view that will be put forward here, the method of critically testing theories, and selecting them according to the results of tests, always proceeds on the following lines. From a new idea, put up tentatively, and not yet justified in any way—an anticipation, a hypothesis, a theoretical system, or what you will—conclusions are drawn by means of logical deduction. These conclusions are then compared with one another and with other relevant statements, so as to find what logical relations (such as equivalence, derivability, compatiblity, or incompatibility) exist between them."&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote {{harv|Popper|1959|p=6}}: "I do not think that his ingenious attempt to provide an a priori justification for synthetic statements was successful." However, if one finds one single swan that is not white, deductive logic admits the conclusion that the statement that all swans are white is false. Falsificationism thus strives for questioning, for falsification, of hypotheses instead of proving them or trying to view them as valid in any way.

For a statement to be questioned using observation, it needs to be at least theoretically possible that it can come into conflict with observation. A key observation of falsificationism is thus that a criterion of demarcation is needed to distinguish those statements that can come into conflict with observation and those that cannot, but the criterion itself concerns only the logical form of the theory: 

{{Quote|text=I shall require that [the] logical form [of the theory] shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience.|sign=Karl Popper|source=[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p 19}}

Popper always insisted on a clear distinction between the logic (of falsifiability) and its applied less precise methodology.&lt;ref |group=notes&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc=Sec. 3}}: "Popper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of falsifiability and its applied methodology."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref |group=notes&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|loc=section 23, 1er paragraphe}} : "The requirement of falsifiability which was a little vague to start with has now been split into two parts. The first, the methodological postulate (cf. section 20), can hardly be made quite precise. The second, the logical criterion, is quite definite as soon as it is clear which statements are to be called ‘basic’."&lt;/ref&gt; The required logical form, the criterion,  is that there must exist basic statements that contradict the theory (and also some that corroborate it because the theory must be consistent). This logical form informally implies the possibility of refutations by experience because, in its informal methodological context, a basic statement must be intersubjective and interpretable in terms of observations.

Objections can be raised against falsifiability as a criterion of demarcation similar to those which can be raised against [[Formal verification|verifiability]].  For example, as pointed out by many{{sfn|Miller|2014|p=4}} and reformulated by Colin McGinn, 
{{quote|text=[w]e have to be able to infer that if a falsifying result has been found in a given experiment it will be found in future experiments; ... this is clearly an inductive inference.|author=Colin McGinn|source={{harvnb|McGinn|2002|loc=sec. 3}}}}

Very early, in anticipation of this specific objection Popper wrote,  
{{Quote|text=This attack would not disturb me.  My proposal is based upon an ''asymmetry'' between verifiability and falsifiability; an asymmetry which results from the logical form of universal statements. For these are never derivable from singular statements, but can be contradicted by singular statements.|sign=Karl Popper|source=[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p 19}}

In its simple form, the point here is that although a singular existential statement such as 'there is a white swan in Europe' cannot be used to affirm a universal statement, it can be used to show that one is false: the statement 'there is a non white swan in Australia' implies that the universal statement 'all swans are white' is false. Moreover, this singular existential statement is empirical: it is impractical to observe all the swans in the world to verify that they are all white, but one can observe one swan that is not white.  This shows the fundamental difference between verifiability and falsifiability. Also, in the logical form of the theory, there is no notion of future experiments, but only a (formal) class of basic statements that contradict it.&lt;ref name="reproducibility" /&gt;&lt;ref name="empiricalisalogicalrequirement"/&gt;

Such a simple contradiction with a basic statement is not what Popper calls a falsification.&lt;ref name="falsifiabilityVsfalsification"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=66|loc=sec. 22}}: "We must clearly distinguish between falsifiability and falsification. We have introduced falsifiability solely as a criterion for the empirical character of a system of statements. As to falsification, special rules must be introduced which will determine under what conditions a
system is to be regarded as falsified."&lt;/ref&gt; A falsification usually entails a derivation from a system of statements, which include the universal statement and initial conditions, to a singular statement, which is contradicted by a falsifying hypothesis,&lt;ref name="reproducibility"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Popper|1959|p=55}}: "We may distinguish, within a theoretical system, statements belonging to various levels of universality. The statements on the highest level of universality are the axioms; statements on the lower levels can be deduced from them. Higher level empirical statements have always the character of hypotheses relative to the lower level statements deducible from them: they can be falsified by the falsification of these less universal statements. ... The falsifying mode of inference here referred to—the way in which the falsification of a conclusion entails the falsification of the system from which it is derived—is the modus tollens of classical logic. It may be described as follows:  Let p be a conclusion of a system t of statements which may consist of theories and initial conditions ..."&lt;/ref&gt; but the argument can be generalized. Popper explains 
{{quote|text="... it is possible by means of purely deductive inferences (with the help of the modus tollens of classical logic) to argue from the truth of singular statements to the falsity of universal statements. Such an argument to the falsity of universal statements is the only strictly deductive kind of inference that proceeds, as it were, in the ‘inductive direction’; that is, from singular to universal statements."|author=Karl Popper|source={{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=19}}}}   Contemporary philosopher [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] mentions{{sfn|Miller|2014|p=4}} that other similar objections have been anticipated and answered by Popper.{{sfn|Popper|1972|loc=Chapter 1}}

The falsifiability criterion does not imply that unfalsifiable systems such as logic, mathematics and metaphysics are not parts of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: "For Popper, however, to assert that a theory is unscientific, is not necessarily to hold that it is unenlightening, still less that it is meaningless, for it sometimes happens that a theory which is unscientific (because it is unfalsifiable) at a given time may become falsifiable, and thus scientific, with the development of technology, or with the further articulation and refinement of the theory. Further, even purely mythogenic explanations have performed a valuable function in the past in expediting our understanding of the nature of reality."&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to intuition, unfalsifiable statements can be embedded in—and [[logical consequence|deductively entailed]] by—falsifiable theories. For example, while "all men are mortal" is unfalsifiable, it is a [[logical consequence]] of the falsifiable theory that "all men die 150 years after their birth at the latest".{{sfn|Keuth|2004|p=45}} Similarly, the ancient metaphysical and unfalsifiable idea of the existence of atoms has led to corresponding falsifiable modern theories. Popper invented the notion of [[metaphysical]] research programs to name such unfalsifiable ideas that guide the search for a new theory.{{sfn|Popper|1982|loc=Introductory comments}}

Thus falsificationism has two levels. At the logical level, scientists use deductive logic to attempt to falsify theories. At the non-logical level, they decide on some criteria, which use falsification and other factors, to pick which theories they will study, improve, replace, apply or (further) test. These other criteria may take into account a metaphysical research program. They are not considered in the formal falsifiability criterion, but they can give a meaning to this criterion. Needless to say, for Popper, these other criteria, the so called rules of the game, are necessary. Some philosophers consider them  as parts of Popper's demarcation criterion, but Popper viewed them only as a necessary context.

In contrast to [[Positivism]], which held that statements are meaningless if they cannot be verified or falsified, Popper claimed that falsifiability is merely a special case of the more general notion of [[critical rationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1963|p=26}}: "The proper answer to my question 'How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?' is, I believe, 'By criticizing the theories or guesses of others and--if we can train ourselves to do so--by criticizing our own theories or guesses.' (The latter point is highly desirable, but not indispensable; for if we fail to criticize our own theories, there may be others to do it for us.) This answer sums up a position which I propose to call 'critical rationalism'."&lt;/ref&gt; even though he admitted that empirical refutation is one of the most effective methods by which theories can be criticized. Criticizability, in contrast to falsifiability, and thus rationality, may be comprehensive (i.e., have no logical limits), though this claim is controversial, even among proponents of Popper's philosophy and critical rationalism.

==Definition==
For Popper (and others) in any scientific discussion we accept a background knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1963|p=238}}: While discussing a problem we always accept (if only temporarily) all kinds of things as unproblematic: they constitute for the time being, and for the discussion of this particular problem, what I call our background knowledge."&lt;/ref&gt; Such a background knowledge is thus implicit in the definition of falsifiability and corresponds to different types of statements, their relationship&lt;ref name="twomeanings"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XXII}}: "We must distinguish two meanings of the expressions ''falsifiable'' and ''falsifiability'':&lt;br /&gt;
"1) ''Falsifiable'' as a logical-technical term, in the sense of the demarcation criterion of falsifiability. This purely logical concept — falsifiable in principle, one might say — rests on a logical relation between the theory in question and the class of basic statements (or the potential falsifiers described by them).&lt;br /&gt;
"2) ''Falsifiable'' in the sense that the theory in question can definitively or conclusively or demonstrably be falsified ("demonstrably falsifiable").&lt;br /&gt;
"I have always stressed that even a theory which is obviously falsifiable in the first sense is never falsifiable in this second sense. (For this reason I have used the expression ''falsifiable'' as a rule only in the first, technical sense. In the second sense, I have as a rule spoken not of ''falsifiability'' but rather of ''falsification'' and of its  problems)"&lt;/ref&gt; and their interpretation in terms of observations and measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=84}}: "... that is to say, basic statements must be testable, inter-subjectively, by ‘observation’. Since they are singular statements, this requirement can of course only refer to observers who are suitably placed in space and time (a point which I shall not elaborate)."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different types of statements===
Recall that a theory is falsifiable if it is contradicted by a basic statement. It remains to define what kind of statements create theories and what are basic statements. [[Physical law|Scientific theories]]  are a particular kind of [[universal quantification|universal statements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=37}}: " The empirical sciences are systems of theories. The logic of scientific knowledge can therefore be described as a theory of theories.  Scientific theories are universal statements."&lt;/ref&gt; Basic statements are particular kind of [[existential quantification|existential statements]].&lt;ref name="basicstatements"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=83–84}}: "A statement of the form ‘There is a so-and-so in the region k’ or ‘Such-and-such an event is occurring in the region k’ (cf. section 23) may be called a ‘singular existential statement’ or a ‘singular there-is statement’. And the statement which results from negating it, i.e. ‘There is no so-and-so in the region k’ or ‘No event of such-and-such a kind is occurring in the region k’, may be called a ‘singular non-existence statement’, or a ‘singular there-is-not statement’.  We may now lay down the following rule concerning basic statements: basic statements have the form of singular existential statements."&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all universal statements are theories and not all existential statements are basic statements. Theories have the form of '''strictly''' universal statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=48}}: "The theories of natural science, and especially what we call natural laws, have the logical form of strictly universal statements; thus they can be expressed in the form of negations of strictly existential statements or, as we may say, in the form of non-existence statements (or ‘there-is-not’ statements). For example, the law of the conservation of energy can be expressed in the form: ‘There is no perpetual motion machine’, or the hypothesis of the electrical elementary charge in the form: ‘There is no electrical charge other than a multiple of the electrical elementary charge’."&lt;/ref&gt; Basic statements have the form of [[wiktionary:singular existential statement|'''singular''' existential statements]].&lt;ref name="basicstatements" /&gt; Thus we need to distinguish between  existential and universal statements and also between singular  and strict  statements.

Existential and universal statements are built-in concepts in [[First-order logic|logic]]. The first are statements  such as "there is a white swan".  Logicians call these statements [[existential quantification|existential statements]], since they assert the existence of something.  They are equivalent to a first-order logic statement of the form: ''There exists an x such that x is a swan, and x is white.'' The second are statements that categorize all instances of something, such as "all swans are white". Logicians call these statements [[universal quantification|universal]]. They are usually parsed in the form: ''For all x, if x is a swan, then x is white''.

Unlike existential and universal statements, singular and strict statements are not built-in concepts in logic, because they correspond to a specific perspective on our experience of the world.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=42}}  We can understand them in terms of the concepts of universal or individual names: {{quote |text="... ‘dictator’, ‘planet’, ‘H2O’ are universal concepts or universal names. ‘Napoleon’, ‘the earth’, ‘the Atlantic’ are singular or individual concepts or names. In these examples individual concepts or names appear to be characterized either by being proper names, or by having to be defined by means of proper names, whilst universal concepts or names can be defined without the use of proper names."|author=Karl Popper|source={{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=42–43}}}}

A statement is strict or pure, if it does not use any individual name. So, a law of nature cannot refer to particular things. The sentence "This apple is attracted by the planet earth" is not a scientific statement. Popper wrote an entire section on strictly universal and strictly existential statements,{{sfn|Popper|1959|pp=47-50}} because he considers the distinction between universal and individual concepts
or names to be of fundamental importance.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=43}}

A statement is singular if it contains an individual name or the equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;This is Popper's definition. There is no well established definition of ''singular statement'', ''singular sentence'' or ''singular proposition''. For example,  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy says that it is a sentence without variables, free or bound. This is also the definition adopted by Alfred Tarski in ''Introduction to logic and to the methodology of deductive sciences''. However, in the debate between Fregeans and Russellians in the philosophy of language, the definition is more restrictive: a singular sentence means a sentence with a single subject that respects a property such as "Mont Blanc is more than 4000 meters high" - see "Singular Propositions and
Singular Thoughts" by Arthur Sullivan.&lt;/ref&gt;   So, a basic statement must make reference to a specific thing or specific location and time. The sentence "There exists a black swan" is not a basic statement, but the statement "There is a black swan on the shore of the Swan River" is a basic statement, it is a singular existential statement.

Popper arrived at these conditions through an analysis of what one expects from basic statements.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=83}}  In addition, a basic statement must be inter-subjective.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=84}} So, "John saw a  black swan on the shore of the Swan River" is not a basic statement.&lt;ref&gt;Unless, of course, the theory is about people seeing black swans, in which case, we view John as a thing, just as the shore is a thing.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological rules and falsifying hypotheses===
Falsifiability is defined strictly in terms of the logical form of the theory,&lt;ref name="twomeanings" /&gt; but this criterion of demarcation can not work without being complemented by methodological rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=28–29}}: "If therefore we characterize empirical science merely by the formal or logical structure of its statements, we shall not be able to exclude from it that prevalent form of metaphysics which results from elevating an obsolete scientific theory into an incontrovertible truth. Such are my reasons for proposing that empirical science should be characterized by its methods: by our manner of dealing with scientific systems: by what we do with them and what we do to them. Thus I shall try to establish the rules, or if you will the norms, by which the scientist is guided when he is engaged in research or in discovery, in the sense here understood."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, contemporary philosophers consider that Popper's demarcation criterion has two parts: the logical part (stated in terms of rules of inference - ways to logically infer new statements from existing statements) and the methodological part (stated in terms of rules that do not claim to prove anything).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 3}}: "Popper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of falsifiability and its applied methodology. The logic of his theory is utterly simple: if a single ferrous metal is unaffected by a magnetic field it cannot be the case that all ferrous metals are affected by magnetic fields. Logically speaking, a scientific law is conclusively falsifiable although it is not conclusively verifiable. Methodologically, however, the situation is much more complex: no observation is free from the possibility of error—consequently we may question whether our experimental result was what it appeared to be."&lt;/ref&gt;  The methodological rules define falsification. They should not be confused with the (logical) rules of inferences used to define falsifiability, which is about the logical form of the theory.&lt;ref name="falsifiabilityVsfalsification"/&gt;

In this larger picture, the fact that a single basic statement can contradict a strictly universal statement, though true logically, is in itself useless, because it cannot lead to a falsification. To support falsification, Popper requires that a class of basic statements corroborate a falsifying hypothesis.&lt;ref name="reproducibility"/&gt; A  basic statement corroborates the falsifying hypothesis, if it does not logically contradict it, but contradicts the theory to be falsified. Though it corresponds to the empirical notion of reproducible experiments, this requirement exists entirely at the formal level&lt;ref name="empiricalisalogicalrequirement"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=66–67}}: "The requirement that the falsifying hypothesis must be empirical, and so falsifiable, only means that it must stand in a certain logical relationship to possible basic statements; thus this requirement only concerns the logical form of the hypothesis."&lt;/ref&gt; and must be complemented by methodological rules in a falsification process.

==Naïve falsification{{anchor|Naïve|Na.C3.AFve}}==&lt;!-- see [[Karl Popper]] --&gt;

Naïve falsificationism is an unsuccessful attempt to prescribe a rationally unavoidable method for science. Sophisticated methodological falsification, on the other hand, is a prescription of a way in which scientists ought to behave as a matter of choice. The object of this is to arrive at an incremental process whereby theories become ''less bad''.{{Citation needed|reason=We don't even know what naive falsification means here|date=June 2018}}

Naïve falsification considers scientific statements individually. Scientific theories are formed from groups of these sorts of statements, and it is these groups that must be accepted or rejected by scientists. Scientific theories can always be defended by the addition of [[ad hoc hypothesis|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]].{{Citation needed|reason=The two previous sentences are not connected - what is the point?|date=June 2018}}  As Popper put it, a ''decision'' is required on the part of the scientist to accept or reject the statements that go to make up a theory or that might falsify it. At some point, the weight of the ''ad hoc'' hypotheses and disregarded falsifying observations will become so great that it becomes unreasonable to support the base theory any longer, and a decision will be made to reject it.{{Citation needed|reason=Where Popper says that|date=June 2018}}

Although the logic of naïve falsification is valid, it is rather limited. Nearly any statement can be made to fit the data, so long as one makes the requisite 'compensatory adjustments'. Popper drew attention to these limitations in ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' in response to criticism from [[Pierre Duhem]]. [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] expounded this argument in detail, calling it [[confirmation holism]]. To logically falsify a [[universality (philosophy)|universal]], one must find a true falsifying singular statement. But Popper pointed out that it is always possible to ''change'' the universal statement or the existential statement so that falsification does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: "It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least."&lt;/ref&gt; On hearing that a black swan has been observed in Australia, one might introduce the ''[[ad hoc]]'' hypothesis, 'all swans are white except those found in Australia'; or one might adopt another, more cynical view about some observers, 'Australian [[ornithology|bird watchers]] are incompetent'.

Thus, naïve falsification ought to, but does not, supply a way of handling competing hypotheses for many subject controversies (for instance [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and [[urban legends]]). People arguing that there is no support for such an observation may argue that there is nothing to see, that all is normal, or that the differences or appearances are too small to be statistically significant.  On the other side are those who concede that an observation has occurred and that a universal statement has been falsified as a consequence.  Therefore, naïve falsification does not enable scientists, who rely on [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] criteria, to present a definitive falsification of universal statements.{{Citation needed|reason=Who says that|date=June 2018}}

==Falsificationism==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

In place of naïve falsification, Popper envisioned science as progressing by the successive rejection of falsified theories, rather than falsified statements.  Falsified theories are to be replaced by theories that can account for the [[phenomena]] that falsified the prior theory, that is, with greater [[explanatory power]]. For example, [[Aristotle|Aristotelian mechanics]] explained observations of everyday situations, but were falsified by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s experiments, and were replaced by Newtonian mechanics, which accounted for the phenomena noted by Galileo (and others). [[Newtonian mechanics]]' reach included the observed motion of the planets and the mechanics of gases. The Youngian wave theory of light (i.e., waves carried by the [[luminiferous aether]]) replaced Newton's (and many of the Classical Greeks') particles of light but in turn was falsified by the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] and was superseded by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electrodynamics and Einstein's [[special relativity]], which did account for the newly observed phenomena. Furthermore, Newtonian mechanics applied to the atomic scale was replaced with [[quantum mechanics]], when the old theory could not provide an answer to the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], the [[Gibbs paradox]], or how [[Atomic orbital|electron orbits]] could exist without the particles radiating away their energy and spiraling towards the centre. Thus the new theory had to posit the existence of unintuitive concepts such as [[energy levels]], [[quantum|quanta]] and [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]].

At each stage, experimental observation made a theory untenable (i.e., falsified it) and a new theory was found that had greater ''explanatory power'' (i.e., could account for the previously unexplained phenomena), and as a result, ''provided greater opportunity for its own falsification''.

==Criterion of demarcation==
Popper uses falsification as a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]] to draw a sharp line between those theories that are scientific and those that are unscientific.  It is useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if for no other reason than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory, or come to see an unfalsifiable theory as unsupportable. Popper claimed that, if a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific.

The Popperian criterion excludes from the domain of science not unfalsifiable ''statements'' but only ''whole theories'' that ''contain no'' falsifiable statements; thus it leaves us with the [[confirmation holism|Duhemian]] problem of what constitutes a 'whole theory' as well as the problem of what makes a statement 'meaningful'.  Popper's own falsificationism, thus, is not only an alternative to verificationism, it is also an acknowledgement of the conceptual distinction that previous theories had ignored.

===Verificationism===
{{Main|Verificationist}}
{{See also|Abductive reasoning}}

In the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism (also known as the verifiability theory of meaning) holds that a statement must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be both meaningful and scientific.
This was an essential feature of the [[logical positivism]] of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]] that included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], the Berlin philosopher [[Hans Reichenbach]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both. In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a criterion of demarcation.

Thus, Popper urged that verifiability be replaced with falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation. On the other hand, he strictly opposed the view that non-falsifiable statements are meaningless or otherwise inherently bad, and noted that falsificationism is only  concerned with meaningful statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=18|loc=footnote 3}}: "Falsifiability separates two kinds of perfectly meaningful statements: the falsifiable and the non-falsifiable. It draws a line inside meaningful language, not around it."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in courts of law===
Falsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases (see below). A survey of 303 federal judges&lt;ref&gt;Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N = 619). Only 303 usable surveys were
obtained for a response rate of 51% (see {{harvnb|Krafka|2002}}).&lt;/ref&gt; conducted in 1998 (and fully reported in {{harvnb|Krafka|2002}}) revealed that  "[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert’s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases."

==== The McLean v. Arkansas case ====
In the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that "[[creation science]]" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):
* It is guided by natural law; 
* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law;  
* It is testable against the empirical world; 
* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and 
* It is falsifiable. 
In his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}

==== The Daubert case ====
In the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.&lt;ref&gt;The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.&lt;/ref&gt;  These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested. ''Scientific methodology today is based on generating hypotheses and testing them to see if they can be falsified; indeed, this methodology is what distinguishes science from other fields of human inquiry.'' Green 645. See also C. Hempel, Philosophy of Natural Science 49 (1966) (''[T]he statements constituting a scientific explanation must be capable of empirical test''); K. Popper, Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge 37 (5th ed. 1989) (''[T]he criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability'') (emphasis deleted).|author=Harry Blackmun|source={{harvnb|Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|1993|p=593}}}}

In a partially dissident opinion, Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]  supported by Associate Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], responded that: {{Quote| text=I defer to no one in my confidence in federal judges; but I am at a loss to know what is meant when it is said that the scientific status of a theory depends on its ''falsifiability,'' and I suspect some of them will be, too.|author = William Rehnquist|source= {{harvnb|Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|1993|p=600}}}}

Professor of Law David H. Kaye&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[David Kaye (law professor)]], United Nations special rapporteur. David H. Kaye is distinguished professor of law at [[Penn State Law]].&lt;/ref&gt; argued that references to the Daubert majority opinion confused falsifiability and falsification and that "inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaye|2005|p=2}}: "... several courts have treated the abstract possibility of falsification as sufficient to satisfy this aspect of the screening of scientific evidence. This essay challenges these views. It first explains the distinct meanings of falsification and falsifiability. It then argues that while the Court did not embrace the views of any specific philosopher of science, inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations. Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unfalsifiable statistics/double evidence standards combo==
There are combinations of prediction types and methodologies that, while each component is compatible with falsifiability on its own, renders falsification impossible together. One example is the combination of statistical predictions in which individual exceptions do not falsify the theory with different evidence standards for different data points in which one type of data point only require ordinary evidence while another require extraordinary evidence. On one hand, the theory that there are no black swans is falsifiable even if there is a requirement of extraordinary evidence for a black swan, since it is not impossible for an individual observation of a black swan to eventually meet the requirement of extraordinary evidence. On the other hand, in a country where there are in reality the same number of black swans as white swans, the theory that there are more white swans than black swans at a population level with individual exceptions is falsifiable as long as the level of evidence required to record a white swan is the same as that for recording black swans. But if the theory is that white swans are more statistically common than black swans with exceptions and a higher level of evidence is required for recording a black swan than for recording a white swan, the difference in evidence standards will cause more white swans than black swans to be recorded even in a country where the ratio is in fact 50/50. This makes the combination of statistical prediction with exceptions and differences in evidence standards incompatible with falsifiability. This have been implicated in the [[replication crisis]], especially in [[psychology]] in which the two methodologies are more common than in other fields and therefore more often combine to prevent falsifiability even though the two factos are not unheard of on their own in other fields, as well as the problem being caused by active application of methodologies and therefore spreading the issues to other fields that psychology interacts with through interdisciplines such as [[evolutionary psychology]] spreading the problems to evolution research, and not allowing the other fields to help falsifiability in psychology as would have been possible had the problem been a passive lack of components for falsifiability.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence | David Miller, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Vast Graveyard of Undead Theories: Publication Bias and Psychological Science’s Aversion to the Null | Christopher J.

==Criticisms==
===Contemporary philosophers===

Several contemporary [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] and [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic philosophers]] are strongly [[Karl Popper#Criticism|critical]] of Popper's philosophy of science.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner (2001), [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/gardner_popper.html "A Skeptical Look at Karl Popper,"] ''Skeptical Inquirer'', 25(4): 13–14, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=The cited article is only a personal rant of Martin Gardner against Popper. Given that, in addition, Gardner is known for his peculiar views on the philosophy of mathematics, it does not exemplify well the claim. |date=June 2018}} Popper's [[Inductive reasoning#Criticism|mistrust]] of [[inductive reasoning]] has led to claims that he misrepresents scientific practice.

{{quote|Sir Karl Popper is not really a participant in the contemporary professional philosophical dialogue; quite the contrary, he has ruined that dialogue. If he is on the right track, then the majority of professional philosophers the world over have wasted or are wasting their intellectual careers. The gulf between Popper's way of doing philosophy and that of the bulk of contemporary professional philosophers is as great as that between astronomy and astrology."|author=[[W. W. Bartley III]]|source="III: Biology – evolutionary epistemology", 1976&lt;ref name="Bartley_1978"&gt;{{citation |first=W. W. |last=Bartley |title=III: Biology – evolutionary epistemology |journal=Philosophia |volume=6 |number=3–4 |date=September–December 1976 |pages=463–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Popper's ideas have failed to convince the majority of professional philosophers because his theory of conjectural knowledge does not even pretend to provide positively justified foundations of belief. Nobody else does better, but they keep trying, like chemists still in search of the [[Philosopher's Stone]] or physicists trying to build [[perpetual motion machines]].|author=[[Rafe Champion]]|source="Agreeing to Disagree: Bartley's Critique of Reason", 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | asin=B00CGETUCM | url=https://www.amazon.com/Reason-Imagination-Critical-Rationalist-Papers-ebook/dp/B00CGETUCM | title=Reason and Imagination (Critical Rationalist Papers Book 2) | author=Champion, Rafe | year=2013 | quote=Philosophers' talk about rationality is apt to soar into the stratosphere of abstractions so it must be stated that Bartley's approach has immediate and practical applications.  Following his teacher, Karl Popper, the operating principle of Bartley's rationalism is the formula 'I may he wrong and you may be right, and by means of critical discussion we may get nearer to the truth of the matter'.  This simple principle of rationality requires philosophical defence in depth, backed up by a wide range of improved traditions and institutions to sustain the flow of ideas and critical discussion. These vehicles already exist of course, if only in rudimentary forms, among them talk-back radio, the range of serious 'little magazines' and programs on TV which allow opposing points of view to he explored and debated. These forums are vitally important despite all their imperfections and lapses into the trivial and the banal; the important thing is that they exist, not that they should be scrupulously fair and unbiased at all times nor that they confine themselves to matters of great moral and intellectual moment.  Bartley has provided philosophical air support for the footsoldiers of rationality.  He offers a solution to the basic logical problem of rationality, namely how can we justify the basic premise of rationality, that is, the principle of rationality itself, the principle that we should engage in critical discussion to seek for rationally defensible beliefs?}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|What distinguishes science from all other human endeavours is that the accounts of the world that our best, mature sciences deliver are strongly supported by evidence and this evidence gives us the strongest reason to believe them.'  That anyway is what is said at the beginning of the advertisement for a recent conference on induction at a celebrated seat of learning in the UK.  It shows how much critical rationalists still have to do to make known the message of ''Logik der Forschung'' concerning what empirical evidence is able to do and what it does.|author=[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]]|source="Some hard questions for critical rationalism", 2011{{sfn|Miller|2014}}}}

===Kuhn and Lakatos===
Whereas Popper was concerned in the main with the ''logic'' of science, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]]'s influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' examined in detail the [[history of science]]. Kuhn argued that scientists work within a conceptual [[paradigm]] that strongly influences the way in which they see data. Scientists will go to great length to defend their paradigm against falsification, by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses to existing theories. Changing a 'paradigm' is difficult, as it requires an individual scientist to break with his or her peers and defend a heterodox theory.

Some falsificationists saw Kuhn's work as a vindication, since it provided historical evidence that science progressed by rejecting inadequate theories, and that it is the ''decision'', on the part of the scientist, to accept or reject a theory that is the crucial element of falsificationism. Foremost amongst these was [[Imre Lakatos]].

Lakatos attempted to explain Kuhn's work by arguing that science progresses by the falsification of ''research programs'' rather than the more specific universal statements of naïve falsification. In Lakatos' approach, a scientist works within a research program that corresponds roughly with Kuhn's 'paradigm'. Whereas Popper rejected the use of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses as unscientific, Lakatos accepted their place in the development of new theories.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978}}

===Feyerabend===
[[Paul Feyerabend]] examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method. Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Sokal and Bricmont===
In their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticized falsifiability on the grounds that it does not accurately describe the way science really works. They argue that theories are used because of their successes, not because of the failures of other theories. Their discussion of Popper, falsifiability and the philosophy of science comes in a chapter entitled "Intermezzo," which contains an attempt to make clear their own views of what constitutes truth, in contrast with the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.

Sokal and Bricmont write, "When a theory successfully withstands an attempt at falsification, a scientist will, quite naturally, consider the theory to be partially confirmed and will accord it a greater likelihood or a higher subjective probability. ... But Popper will have none of this: throughout his life he was a stubborn opponent of any idea of 'confirmation' of a theory, or even of its 'probability'. ... [but] the history of science teaches us that scientific theories come to be accepted above all because of their successes." (Sokal and Bricmont 1997, 62f)

They further argue that falsifiability cannot distinguish between astrology and astronomy, as both make technical predictions that are sometimes incorrect.

[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]], a contemporary philosopher of critical rationalism, has attempted to defend Popper against these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=David|title=Sokal and Bricmont: Back to the Frying Pan|journal=Pli|volume=9|year=2000|pages=156–73|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/staff/miller/miller_pli_9.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003401/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/staff/miller/miller_pli_9.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}, also chapter 6 of {{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=David|title=Out of Error|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller argues that astrology does not lay itself open to falsification, while astronomy does, and this is the litmus test for science.

===Economics===
[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from falsifiable to unfalsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: "For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/ Methodological Individualism at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mises_Action"&gt;Ludwig von Mises. [[Human Action]], p. 11, "r. Purposeful Action and Animal Reaction". Referenced 2011-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper's, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].

===Evolution===
{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}
Numerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents. [[J.B.S. Haldane]], when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied "[[precambrian rabbit|fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution, Third Edition |first=M |last=Ridley |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Limited |year=2003 |isbn=1-4051-0345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.&lt;ref name="The Evolution Wars"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=C |title=The Evolution Wars |publisher=Time Magazine |date=2005-08-07 |page=32|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[River Out of Eden]] |publisher=Basic Books |year=1995 |isbn=0-465-06990-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Blind Watchmaker]] |publisher=W.

===Young-earth creationism===
{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}

Much of the criticism against [[young-Earth creationism]] is based on evidence in nature that the Earth is much older than adherents believe.  Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.

===Historicism===
Theories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper "fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history"&lt;ref name="popperc"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Research training for social scientists: a handbook for postgraduate researchers

&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,&lt;ref name="popperc" /&gt;  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.

===Mathematics===
Like all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]]. [[Albert Einstein]] wrote, "One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Albert Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Sidelights on relativity |chapter=Geometry and Experience |page=27 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1923}} Reprinted by Dover (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-486-24511-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the Free software community in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] can be traced back to the group of [[TeX]] users around the [[University of Kerala]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://swatantryam.blogspot.in/2007/08/story-of-free-software-in-kerala-india.html|title=Free as in Freedom: The Story of Free Software in Kerala, India|website=swatantryam.blogspot.in|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in early 1980s. The community then later named themselves Thiruvananthapuram LUG (Indian Linux Users Group),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; GNU/Linux Users Group, Thiruvananthapuram&lt;ref name="A celebration of software freedom"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/article1342429.ece|title=A celebration of software freedom|date=2008-09-21|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then ultimately&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/ilug-tvm/b1UJd2QrbNA/4_qfRKCe28cJ|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Free Software Users Group, Thiruvananthapuram'''. The community has worked with the government in helping with key Free software initiatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://insights.ubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/CaseStudy_GovKerala1.pdf|title=Legislators in Kerala, India work better with Ubuntu laptops|last=|first=|date=|website=Ubuntu Case Studies|publisher=Ubuntu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the government and also in promoting&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/article154103.ece|title=Spreading the glow of free software|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supporting&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.technoparktoday.com/keralas-first-gnulinux-install-fest-on-12-april-2008-in-trivandrum/|title=Kerala’s First GNU/Linux Install Fest on 12-April-2008 in Trivandrum|date=2008-04-10|website=TechnoparkToday.com  - Technopark Life, News, Jobs, Events &amp; Lifestyle!|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free software among the general public.&lt;ref name="CM to open free software meet"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/article13363.ece|title=CM to open free software meet|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community has also been instrumental&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in creating an IT policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerala.gov.in/documents/10180/46696/IT%20Policy%202007|title=Kerala State IT Policy 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Kerala|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; favorable to Free software in the state of [[Kerala]].

== Main Activities ==

=== Free software install fests ===
One of the organized activities of the community was to organize GNU/Linux install fests in and around the city. These were usually organized in educational institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/article40338.ece|title=Linux Install Fest at Dishaa ‘09|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or public places&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; where the general public could bring their computers to get a GNU/Linux distribution installed on them. As GNU/Linux distributions became more and more easy to be installed and configured the community has stopped organizing these.

=== Developer camps ===
The group has also worked with [[Swathanthra Malayalam Computing|SMC]] in organizing developer camps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.deccanchronicle.com/131016/news-current-affairs/article/malayalam-computing-has-come-age|title=Malayalam computing has come of age  {{!}} Deccan Chronicle|website=archives.deccanchronicle.com|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Thiruvananthapuram and outside. During developer camps developers are given hands-on experience in working with Free software tools and primarily around localization initiatives which SMC is involved with.

=== Software / Hardware Freedom Day ===
The Free software community in Thiruvananthapuram has also been involved in organizing Software Freedom Day celebrations&lt;ref name="A celebration of software freedom"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keralabiznews.com/2489/open-source-proponents-in-trivandrum-celebrate-software-freedom-day|title=Open source proponents in Trivandrum celebrate Software Freedom Day|date=2014-09-26|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hardware Freedom Day celebrations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://entecity.com/news/trivandrum-to-observe-hardware-freedom-day/|title=Trivandrum to observe Hardware Freedom Day|date=2013-04-19|website=EnteCity News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hardware-freedom-day-fete-today/article4635906.ece|title=Hardware Freedom Day fete today|date=2013-04-20|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the city.

=== Free software release parties ===
The community  has also organized release parties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yentha.com/news/view/1/Free-Software-Enthusiasts-Celebrate-Ubuntu-10.04-Release|title=Free Software Enthusiasts Celebrate Ubuntu 10.04 Release - Trivandrum News {{!}} Yentha.com|website=www.yentha.com|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate the release of the different Free software like Ubuntu,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keralaitnews.com/4373/free-software-ug-celebrate-ubuntu-release|title=Free Software UG celebrate Ubuntu release|date=2010-05-02|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firefox etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4187">'''Gaianism''' is an earth-centered philosophical, [[holistic]],  scientifically non-religiously supported, and the spiritual opinion that shares expressions with various religions such as [[earth religion]]s and [[paganism]] while not identifying exclusively with any specific one.&lt;ref name=book1&gt;{{cite book|last= Dobson|first = Andrew | title=The Politics of Nature: Explorations in Green Political Theory|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415124719|pages=8, 9, 14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gvWHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Gaianism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zw117IPrP-&amp;sig=aFDPGzH1Xc5E7RneT8YKZTK-bWM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3VxnU4ruI-3IsASXsoD4BA&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gaianism%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richard Peet|first=Nigel Thrift|title=New Models in Geography - Vol 1: The Political-Economy Perspective|date=1989|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0049101013|pages=90, 97–99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gdyHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=%22Gaianism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_V1nU6PzN8HNsQTtw4LwCg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gaianism%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomprehensible inline|reason=Not a valid English sentence, and I don't know what's meant.|date=September 2018}} The term describes a philosophy and ethical worldview which, though not necessarily religious, implies a [[transpersonal]] devotion to earth as a [[superorganism]]. Practitioners of Gaianism are called Gaians.

[[Marcel Wissenburg]] has described Gaianism as a "modern variant of philosophical determinism".&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt; Gaianism has been associated with the [[New Age movement]] due to sharing similar viewpoints, but is not typically identified as strictly part of the New Age movement as a whole. Scientific support of belief comes from [[Gaia hypothesis]] and [[living systems theory]]. Supporting [[Gaia]]'s [[homeostasis]], ecological activism, with spiritual belief is compatible with [[deep ecology]].

==Beliefs==
Followers of Gaianism state that the term is based both in the felt connection and scientific understanding of the [[biosphere]], which is given the name [[Gaia]]. The namesake [[Greek primordial deities|primordial deity]] from [[Greek mythology]] is the mother of all beings, both god and animal, born from her union with the sky ([[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]) and the sea ([[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]]). Gaians believe that naming the biosphere Gaia helps encourage practitioners and others to see the living planet as an organism with an intrinsic personality that expresses itself through [[evolution]].

Gaianism's philosophy stems from [[James Lovelock]]'s [[Gaia hypothesis]], which proposes that organisms interact with their surroundings on earth to form a more complex and self-regulating system that contributes to maintaining the conditions for life on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Mike|title=The Greening of British Party Politics|date=1992|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719031990|pages=54–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xUNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22Gaianism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_V1nU6PzN8HNsQTtw4LwCg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gaianism%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaia can be understood as a superorganism made of organisms, as multicellular life can be understood as a superorganism at a smaller level of scale.

==Practitioners==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Practitioners of Gaianism are termed "Gaians", or sometimes ''Gaianists''. Followers typically approach the philosophy with the perspective that you should honor the earth, reduce or soften the [[Ecological footprint|human impact on the earth]], and to be respectful of all life on earth. The latter perspective is extended to all forms of life such as plant, animal, or human, and followers will often try to maintain a close relationship with the planet in order to strive toward [[world peace]], maintain global [[homeostasis]] and find inner fulfillment. Gaians will occasionally follow Gaianism along with other religions, but for many Gaianism is not necessarily religious.

The expression '''immaculate perception''' has been used in various senses by various philosophers.

* It is a [[nickname]] for [[Plato]]'s theory of knowledge.  It is called this because Plato believed that all knowledge came from past lives, and from one's knowledge of [[The Forms]].
* It was used by the English philosopher [[Francis Bacon]], who referred to it as the necessity of "keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature and so receiving the images simply as they are."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Francis. (1620). The Great Instauration.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was used by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his text ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''.  Nietzsche argued that this kind of perception mere fiction, for it ignores the intimate connection between the perceiver and the external world.  In particular, it denies the important role that the will and desires of the perceiver have on every perception.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, Michael. ''A Dancer’s Virtue: Human Life in Light of Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence''. Concept XXVIII, 2005. [http://www.publications.villanova.edu/Concept/2005/Dancer's%20Virtue.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapper 8Ball released a song in March 2012 titled "immaculate perception" featuring Waka Flocka Flame and Yelawolf.

'''Jeanne Harley Guillemin''' (born 1943) is a [[medical anthropologist]] and author, who for 25 years was a Professor of Sociology at [[Boston College]] and for the last ten years, a senior fellow in the [http://web.mit.edu/ssp/ Security Studies Program] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/hsp/People/Guillemin.htm |title=Jeanne Guillemin''' |publisher=sussex.ac.uk |accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is an authority on [[biological weapons]] and has published four books on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Jeanne+Guillemin&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C44&amp;as_sdtp= |title=Jeanne Guillemin''' |publisher=scholar.google.com |accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/09/14/140216982/poison-in-the-post-revisiting-american-anthrax |title=Review |publisher=npr.org |accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.edition.cnn.com/2001/COMMUNITY/10/15/guillemin/index.html |title=Anthrax risk and prevention |date=October 15, 2001 |publisher=cnn.com |accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2017}}
While at Boston College, Guillemin did extensive research on hospital technology and medical ethics, receiving fellowships to work on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee staff and at the [[Hastings Center for the Study of Ethics]]. She was also co-head of the [[National Library of Medicine]]'s [[HealthAware Project]], a joint project with [[Harvard Medical School]] to test how the internet could be used to educate people about preventive health measures.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ssp.mit.edu/people/jeanne-guillemin |title=Jeanne Guillemin''' |publisher=MIT.edu |accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Guillemin became interested in the misuse of biomedical science by government weapons programs. She involved herself in two of her husband's investigations of alleged violations of international arms control agreements by the Soviet Union which involved germ weapons. The first was the "[[yellow rain]]" accusation by the United States against the USSR, to the effect that the Soviets enabled the [[Lao People's Army|Laotian army]] to use deadly [[mycotoxin]]s to attack [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugees allied with the US during the [[Vietnam War]]. This accusation had been disputed by Meselson in 1983 when he argued that the yellow material was actually bee feces mistaken for a biological weapon by those under attack and by certain US government scientists. (The issue remains disputed and the US government has not withdrawn the allegations, arguing that the controversy has not been fully resolved.)&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

In 1992, Guillemin became part of Meselson's investigation into another Cold War controversy, the [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak|1979 outbreak of anthrax]] in [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak|Sverdlovsk]], a closed Soviet city in the [[Ural Mountains]]. The Soviet government claimed the cause was infected meat. Guillemin's interviews with the families of victims (64 people were recorded as dying) resulted in an epidemiological map showing the source to be an air-borne release of anthrax spores from a military facility where, in violation of the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]], the testing of anthrax weapons had been in process. In 1994, the results of this research were published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and in 1999 her book on this research was published (''Anthrax: The Investigation of a Deadly Outbreak'', U of California Press).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

After 9/11, with the advent of the anthrax letter attacks, Guillemin was frequently asked by the media to explain the disease, based on her experience in Russia. In 2005 she published ''Biological Weapons: From State-sponsored Programs to Contemporary Bioterorism'', Columbia U Press) which offers a concise, comprehensive history of how anthrax and other microbes were developed as weapons over the course of the 20th century, resulting in potential bioterrorism. She turned her attention to the 2001 anthrax letter attacks after the 2008 suicide of the FBI's prime suspect, an anthrax scientist who worked for the U.S. Army at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Her third book on biological weapons is about the letters and their impact on victims and government organizations. It is called ''American Anthrax: Fear, Crime, and the Investigation of the Nation's Deadliest Bioterror Attack'', (Macmillan/Holt/Times, 2011).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4449">'''Leveling''' is a social process in which the uniqueness of the individual is rendered non-existent by assigning equal value to all aspects of human endeavors, thus missing all the intricacies and subtle complexities of human identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus, Hubert]]. ''Kierkegaard on the Internet: Anonymity Vrs. Commitment in the Present Age''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20131222055423/http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/html/paper_kierkegaard.html Berkeley.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Leveling is highly associated with [[existentialism|existential]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]].

==Overview==
For Kierkegaard, leveling was the process of suppressing individuality to a point where the individual's uniqueness becomes non-existent and nothing meaningful in his existence can be affirmed:

{{quote|Leveling at its maximum is like the stillness of death, where one can hear one's own heartbeat, a stillness like death, into which nothing can penetrate, in which everything sinks, powerless. One person can head a rebellion, but one person cannot head this leveling process, for that would make him a leader and he would avoid being leveled. Each individual can in his little circle participate in this leveling, but it is an abstract process, and leveling is abstraction conquering individuality.|Søren Kierkegaard|''The Present Age'', translated by Alexander Dru with Foreword by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], 1962, pp. 51–53&lt;!--as it appears in http://www.historyguide.org/europe/present_age.html--&gt;}}

However, Kierkegaard's idea of leveling wasn't one of making life meaningless but of making life equal because every single individual has equal access to the grace and gifts of God. He wasn't concerned with earthly and material goods.

{{quote|The more a person weans his soul from understanding the imperfect to grasping the perfect, the more he will appropriate the explanation of life that comforts while it is day and remains with him when night comes, when he lies forgotten in his grave and has himself forgotten what moth and rust have consumed and human sagacity has found out, and yet he will have a thought that can fill out the long interval for him, that will know nothing of the difference that troubled him but is aware only of the equality that is from above, the equality in love, which lasts and is the only thing that lasts, the equality that does not allow any human being to be another’s debtor, except as Paul says, in the one debt, the debt of loving one another. — ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' by Søren Kierkegaard, ed. by Howard Vincent Hong and Edna Hatlestad Hong, 1992, p. 158}}

[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] wrote of leveling: "by averageness and leveling down, everything gets obscured, and what has thus been covered up gets passed off as something familiar and accessible to everyone. ...by virtue of an insensitivity to all distinctions in level and genuineness, and in providing average intelligibility, opens up a standard world in which all distinctions between the unique and the general, the superior and the average, the important and the trivial have been leveled".&lt;ref name="Dreyfus"&gt;{{Cite book |title= Being-in-the-World A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time|last= Dreyfus |first= Hubert |year=1990 |publisher= [[MIT Press]]|location= Cambridge|isbn= 0-262-54056-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger's view of important things becoming mundane and non-specific points towards [[Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] concept of [[master–slave morality]], in which the weak and disenfranchised reframe the positive traits of the strong and powerful as not worth pursuing.

A '''love song''' is a [[song]] about [[Romance (love)|romantic love]], [[falling in love]], [[broken heart|heartbreak]] after a [[breakup]], and the feelings that these experiences bring.&lt;ref name="ezine"&gt;{{cite web |title=Love Songs and Their Meanings Throughout History |author=Anna M Everskemper |publisher=Ezine @rticles}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of even the best known performers and composers of love songs would be a large order.

Love songs can be found in a variety of different music genres.

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
Love songs have been around for centuries and can be found in the histories and cultures of most societies, though their ubiquity is a modern phenomenon.

A highly controversial and startling explanation of the genesis of love songs can be found in [[Denis de Rougemont|Denis de Rougemont's]] "Love in the Western World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freecelebritynews.org/best-list-of-love-songs/ |title=Best List of Love Songs 2013 |publisher=Free Celebrity News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111022445/http://freecelebritynews.org/best-list-of-love-songs/ |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Rougemont's thesis is that love songs grew out of the courtly love songs of the troubadours, and that those songs represented a rejection of the historical Christian notion of love.

Identities of love songs change from time to time, from the decade of love in the '70s, through night partying in the '80s, and into dark romance of the '90s. Love songs did not have an identity in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="ezine" /&gt;

'''Martin Hägglund''' (born 23 November 1976) is a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[philosopher]], [[literary theorist]], and scholar of [[modernist literature]]. He is Professor of Comparative Literature and Humanities at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://complit.yale.edu/h-gglund |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601131952/http://complit.yale.edu/h-gglund |archivedate=2013-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a member of the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socfell.fas.harvard.edu/senior%20and%20junior%20fellows.html&lt;/ref&gt; serving as a Junior Fellow from 2009 to 2012. Hägglund is the author of ''Dying for Time: Proust, Woolf, Nabokov'' (2012), ''Radical Atheism: Derrida and the Time of Life'' (2008), and ''Kronofobi: Essäer om tid och ändlighet'' (''Chronophobia: Essays on Time and Finitude'', 2002).

==Works==
===''Radical Atheism''===
''Radical Atheism'' is a major intervention in [[deconstruction]], offering a novel account of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s thinking of time and space, life and death, good and evil, self and other.  Against the prevalent notion that there was an ethical or religious “turn” in Derrida's thinking, Hägglund argues that a radical atheism informs his work from beginning to end. [[Atheism]] has traditionally limited itself to denying the existence of God and immortality, without questioning the desire for God and immortality. In contrast, radical atheism seeks to demonstrate that the desire for a timeless eternity (immortality) dissimulates a desire to live on in time (survival). Rather than being dependent on a transcendent ideal, all our commitments presuppose an investment in and care for finite life. Developing a deconstructive account of time, Hägglund shows how Derrida rethinks the constitution of identity, the violence of ethics, the desire of religion, and political emancipation in accordance with the condition of temporal finitude.

===''Dying for Time''===
''Dying for Time'' offers new readings of the problem of temporality in the writings of [[Marcel Proust]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Vladimir Nabokov]]. Through an engagement with [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]], Hägglund also develops an original theory of the relation between time and desire ("chronolibido"), addressing mourning and melancholia, pleasure and pain, attachment and loss.

{{For|other senses of "monad"|Monad (disambiguation){{!}}Monad}}
[[File:Monad.svg|thumb|The circled dot was used by the Pythagoreans and later Greeks to represent the first metaphysical being, the '''Monad''' or [[The Absolute]].]]
{{God}}

'''Monad''' (from Greek μονάς ''monas'', "singularity" in turn from μόνος ''monos'', "alone"),&lt;ref&gt;Compact Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; refers in [[cosmogony]] to the [[God|Supreme Being]], [[divinity]], or the totality of all things. The concept was reportedly conceived  by the [[Pythagoreans]]  and may refer variously to a single source acting alone, or to an indivisible origin, or to both.  The concept was later adopted by other philosophers, such as [[Leibniz]], who referred to the monad as an [[elementary particle]]. It had a [[geometric]] counterpart, which was debated and discussed contemporaneously by the same groups of people.

==Historical background==
According to [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]], the worldview was inspired by the [[Pythagoreans]], who called the first thing that came into existence the "monad", which begat (bore) the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] (from the Greek word for two), which begat the [[number]]s, which begat the [[Point (geometry)|point]], begetting [[line (geometry)|line]]s or [[Wikt:finite|finiteness]],  etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It meant [[divinity]], the first being, or the totality of all beings, referring in [[cosmogony]] (creation theories) variously to source acting alone and/or an indivisible origin and [[abstraction (philosophy)|equivalent comparators]].&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks, Arthur, Ed., "The First Philosophers of Greece". K. Paul, Trench, Trubner. London, 1898, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophers like [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] condemned Gnosticism (see [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]]) for their treatment of the monad.

===Pythagorean concept===
For the Pythagoreans, the generation of number series was related to objects of [[geometry]] as well as [[cosmogony]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandywell, p. 205. ''The generation of the series of number is to the Pythagoreans, in other words, both the generation of the objects of geometry and also cosmogony. Since things equal numbers, the first unit, in generating the number series, is generating also the physical universe. (KR: 256) From this perspective ‘the monad’ or ‘One’ was readily identified with the divine origin of reality.''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], from the monad evolved the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]]; from it numbers; from numbers, points; then lines, two-dimensional entities, three-dimensional entities, bodies, culminating in [[Classical element|the four elements]] earth, water, fire and air, from which the rest of our world is built up.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], '' Lives of Eminent Philosophers.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This Pythagorean cosmogony is in some sense similar to a brief passage found in the [[Daoist]] ''[[Daodejing|Laozi]]'': "From the Dao comes one, from one comes two, from two comes three, and from three comes the ten thousand things." （道生一、一生二、二生三、三生萬物。） ''Dao De Jing,'' Chapter 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern philosophy==
The term monad was later adopted from [[Greek philosophy]] by [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] ([[Monadology]]), [[John Dee]], and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3296">A '''moral hierarchy''' is a [[hierarchy]] by which actions are ranked by their [[morality]], with respect to a [[moral code]]. 

It also refers to a relationship – such as teacher/pupil or [[guru]]/disciple – in which one party is taken to have greater moral awareness than the other;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j31/moral-hierarchy.asp Moral hierarchy] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20081122224253/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j31/moral-hierarchy.asp |date=2008-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or to the beneficial hierarchy of parent/child or doctor/patient.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Steiner, in ''The Radical Therapist'' (1974) p. 40-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kohlberg==

[[Kohlberg's stages of moral development]] have been read as creating a hierarchy of increasing moral complexity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://brianwilliamson.id.au/cit/level1/psych1/kohlberg.pdf Society and the Highest Stage of Moral Development]&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from the premoral at the bottom, through the midrange of conventionalism, up to the apex of self-selected morality.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Loevinger, ''Ego Development'' (1976) p. 119-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In similar fashion, [[Robin Skynner]] viewed moral ideas (such as the 'myths' of [[Charis Katakis]]) as being interpretable at different levels, depending on the degree of mental health attained;&lt;ref&gt;R. Skynner/J. Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (1994) p. 247-54&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Eric Berne]] saw the three [[Transactional analysis#Key ideas|ego states]] of Parent/Adult/Child as falling naturally into a moral hierarchy universally respected in both time and place.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Transactional Analysis in Psychotherapy'' (1961) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dante==

[[Dante]]'s universe was structured in a hierarchy of moral sins and moral virtues,&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Jackson, ''The Word and its Witness'' (1999) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; the stratified circles of Hell reaching down for example from the self-indulgent sins at the higher levels, to those of violence below, and the fraudulent at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell'' (1975) p. 75 and p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confucianism==

The [[Confucius|Confucian]] concept of a moral hierarchy traditionally served as a check on arbitrary power in China.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Levinson, ''Confucian China and its Modern Fate'' 2 (1965) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably at least, the concept of a moral hierarchy still influences China's view of its place in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;Z &amp; S Shih, ''China's Just World'' (1993) p. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics charge that the notion of a moral hierarchy is untenable in cases spanning multiple cultures, because moral codes are not equal but different, and therefore there is no way of showing that certain codes are [[Morality|superior]] to others.

Proponents of Kohlberg argue against such a relativistic view of morality, however, by pointing to cross-cultural evidence from more than 30 societies supporting the concept of a hierarchy of levels of moral complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brianwilliamson.id.au/cit/level1/psych1/kohlberg.pdf Society...]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mysterium Cosmographicum''''' (lit. '''''The Cosmographic Mystery''''', alternately translated as '''''Cosmic Mystery''''', '''''The Secret of the World''''', or some variation) is an astronomy book by the German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]], published at [[Tübingen]] in 1596 and in a second edition in 1621.  The full title being '''''Forerunner of the Cosmological Essays, Which Contains the Secret of the Universe; on the Marvelous Proportion of the Celestial Spheres, and on the True and Particular Causes of the Number, Magnitude, and Periodic Motions of the Heavens; Established by Means of the Five Regular Geometric Solids''''' (Latin: ''Prodromus dissertationum cosmographicarum, continens mysterium cosmographicum, de admirabili proportione orbium coelestium, de que causis coelorum numeri, magnitudinis, motuumque periodicorum genuinis &amp; proprijs, demonstratum, per quinque regularia corpora geometrica'').  Kepler proposed that the distance relationships between the six planets known at that time could be understood in terms of the five [[Platonic solid|Platonic solids]], enclosed within a sphere that represented the orbit of [[Saturn]].

This book explains Kepler's cosmological theory, based on the [[heliocentrism|Copernican system]], in which the five [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] regular [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] dictate the structure of the universe and reflect God's plan through geometry. This was the first attempt since [[Copernicus]] to say that the theory of [[heliocentrism]] is physically true.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Voekel. "Classics of Astronomy by Johannes Kepler". chapin.williams.edu. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kepler's account from this text, the ratio was brought to his attention accidentally while demonstrating the calculation of the ratio between a circle and a circle created by a rotated inscribed circle.  From this he realized that he had stumbled on the same ratio between the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter.  He wrote, "I believe it was by divine ordinance that I obtained by chance that which previously I could not reach by any pains."&lt;ref&gt;Caspar. "Kepler", p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  But after doing further calculations he realized he could not use the two-dimensional polygons to represent all the planets, but instead he had to use the five [[Platonic solids]].

==Shapes and the planets==
[[Image:Kepler-solar-system-1.png|thumb|right|Kepler's [[Platonic solid]] model of the [[Solar system]] from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' (1600)]]

Johannes Kepler's first major astronomical work, ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' (''The Cosmographic Mystery''), was the first published defence of the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]]. Kepler claimed to have had an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] on July 19, 1595, while teaching in [[Graz]], demonstrating the periodic [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] of [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]] in the [[zodiac]]: he realized that [[regular polygon]]s bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional [[polyhedron|polyhedra]]. He found that each of the five Platonic solids could be uniquely inscribed and circumscribed by spherical [[orb (astronomy)|orbs]]; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets—[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]]. By ordering the solids correctly—[[octahedron]], [[icosahedron]], [[dodecahedron]], [[tetrahedron]], [[cube]]—Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding (within the accuracy limits of available astronomical observations) to the relative sizes of each planet’s path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet’s orb to the length of its [[orbital period]]: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;60–65; see also: Barker and Goldstein, "Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological and philosophical foundation==

As he indicated in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed [[God]]’s geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler’s enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his [[theological]] convictions about the connection between the physical and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]]; the universe itself was an image of God, with the [[Sun]] corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the [[Jesus|Son]], and the intervening space between to the [[Holy Spirit]]. His first manuscript of ''Mysterium'' contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;Barker and Goldstein. "Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy," pp.&amp;nbsp;99–103, 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the support of his mentor [[Michael Maestlin]], Kepler received permission from the Tübingen university senate to publish his manuscript, pending removal of the Bible [[exegesis]] and the addition of a simpler, more understandable description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler’s new ideas.  ''Mysterium'' was published late in 1596, and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597; it was not widely read, but it established Kepler’s reputation as a highly skilled astronomer. The effusive dedication, to powerful patrons as well as to the men who controlled his position in Graz, also provided a crucial doorway into the [[Patronage|patronage system]].&lt;ref&gt;Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;65–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the details would be modified in light of his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of ''Mysterium Cosmographicum''. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of ''Mysterium'', half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.&lt;ref&gt;Field. ''Kepler's Geometrical Cosmology'', Chapter IV, p 73ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemology and philosophy of sciences==
Many of Kepler's thoughts about epistemology can be found in his ''Defense of Tycho against Ursus'' or ''Contra Ursum'' (CU), a work which emerged from a polemical framework, the plagiarism conflict between Nicolaus Raimarus Ursus (1551–1600) and Tycho Brahe: causality and physicalization of astronomical theories, the concept and status of astronomical hypotheses, the polemic “realism-instrumentalism”, his criticism of scepticism in general, the epistemological role of history, etc. Jardine has pointed out that it would be sounder to read Kepler's CU more as a work against scepticism than in the context of the modern realism/instrumentalism debate.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Jardine, 'The Birth of History and Philosophy of Science' p. 211 - p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand, “causality” is a notion implying the most general idea of “actual scientific knowledge” which guides and stimulates each investigation. In this sense, Kepler already embarked in his MC on a causal investigation by asking for the cause of the number, the sizes and the “motions” (= the speeds) of the heavenly spheres. On the other hand, “causality” implies in Kepler, according to the Aristotelian conception of physical science, the concrete “physical cause”, the efficient cause which produces a motion or is responsible for keeping the body in motion. Original to Kepler, however, and typical of his approach is the resoluteness with which he was convinced that the problem of equipollence of the astronomical hypotheses can be resolved and the consequent introduction of the concept of causality into astronomy – traditionally a mathematical science. This approach is already present in his MC, where he, for instance, relates for the first time the distances of the planets to a power which emerges from the Sun and decreases in proportion to the distance of each planet, up to the sphere of the fixed stars (see Stephenson 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10).

==Reception==
In response to ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'', the Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] said the ideas were intriguing but could only be verified through the observations Brahe himself had been making over the past 30 years. Because he was promised use of these observations by Brahe, Kepler sought him out in the beginning of 1600. Brahe, however, only gave him the data on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Voekel. ''Classics of Astronomy by Johannes Kepler''. chapin.williams.edu. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' was featured on the [[Austria|Austrian]] 10 [[euro]] [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|Johannes Kepler silver commemorative coin]] minted in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coin-database.com/coins/10-euro-eggenberg-palace-austria-2002.html coin-database.com, ''10 euro: Eggenberg Palace''.]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the Curiosity Box by Vsauce released a T-Shirt and postcard with simplified illustrations of Kepler's [[Platonic solid]] model of the [[Solar system]] on them.

'''Nguyễn Thuyên''' or '''Hàn Thuyên''' (dates of birth and death unknown) was a 13th-century [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] official and writer. According to ''[[Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư]]'', in 1282, he composed a piece of writing, throwing it into the [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]] to chase away a [[crocodile]], similar to what the [[Tang Dynasty]] official and writer [[Han Yu]] once did. As a result, Emperor [[Trần Nhân Tông]] gave him the surname Hàn. He is known as the first one to compose [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] poems in [[chữ Nôm]], although his works did not survive. Following the Chinese model, he divided the six tones of Vietnamese into "flat" (平) and "sharp" (仄), and used this distinction as the metrical foundation of his poems. The poets after him followed this practice.

'''''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist''''' (1950; second edition 1956; third edition 1968; fourth edition 1974; fifth edition 2013) is a book about the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] by the philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]. The book, first published by [[Princeton University Press]], was influential and is considered a classic study. Kaufmann has been credited with helping to transform Nietzsche's reputation after [[World War II]] by dissociating him from Nazism, and making it possible for Nietzsche to be taken seriously as a philosopher. However, he has been criticized for presenting Nietzsche as an existentialist, and for other details of his interpretation.

==Summary==
Kaufmann writes that he "aims at a comprehensive reconstruction of Nietzsche's thought". He attempts to discredit a "Nietzsche legend" consisting of a variety of false beliefs about Nietzsche, such as the idea that he was a "proto-Nazi". He argues that Nietzsche's sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] and the poet [[Stefan George]] are among those responsible for the legend, and that the rise of [[Nazism]] helped spread misconceptions about Nietzsche. He compares Nietzsche's ideas to those of [[existentialism]], and discusses views of Nietzsche held by the philosophers [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Karl Jaspers]].{{sfn|Kaufmann|2013|pages=xxi, 4, 8–9, 74–75, 89–93, 420}}

Writing in a 1974 appendix, Kaufmann criticizes the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] for poor scholarship in his treatment of Nietzsche in his book ''[[Knowledge and Human Interests]]'' (1968), noting that Habermas relied on the inadequate edition of Nietzsche's works prepared by Karl Schlechta. In a footnote, Kaufmann claims to have received a confession from minor author David George Plotkin that he had ghostwritten ''[[My Sister and I (Nietzsche)|My Sister and I]]'', which was published under Nietzsche's name in 1951.{{sfn|Kaufmann|2013|pages=452–453, 503}}

==Publication history==
''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' was first published by [[Princeton University Press]] in 1950. A second edition was published in 1956, a third edition in 1968, and a fourth edition, which was the first paperback printing, in 1974. In 2013 an edition with a new foreword by the philosopher [[Alexander Nehamas]] was published.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Nehamas|2013|pages=iv–xxiv}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' was reviewed by Chris Terry in ''[[Times Higher Education]]''.{{sfn|Terry|2010|page=49}} The book was also discussed by the philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] in ''[[The New Republic]]''.{{sfn|Rorty|1983|page=619}}

Rorty described the book as "path-breaking", but wrote that it had been superseded by the philosopher [[Richard Schacht]]'s ''Nietzsche'' (1983), which in Rorty's view was more comprehensive, better organized and more helpful to readers who were new to Nietzsche and needed help in understanding the apparent contradictions in Nietzsche's views.{{sfn|Rorty|1983|page=619}}

===Academic journals===
''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' received positive reviews from Walter Watson in ''[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]]'' and the philosopher [[Frederick Copleston]] in ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]''.{{sfn|Watson|1951|pages=231–232}}{{sfn|Copleston|1952|pages=367–368}} In ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]'', it received positive reviews from Walter Cerf and the anthropologist [[H. James Birx]],{{sfn|Cerf|1951|pages=287–291}}{{sfn|Birx|1977|pages=432–433}} and in ''[[The Review of Metaphysics]]'' it was reviewed by F. D. J. and O. H. S.{{sfn|J.|1957|pages=721–722}}{{sfn|S.|1970|page=557}} The book was also reviewed by the historian of ideas [[Crane Brinton]] in ''The Germanic Review'',{{sfn|Brinton|1951|pages=239–240}} William A. Mueller in ''[[Review &amp; Expositor]]'',{{sfn|Mueller|1952|pages=219–221}} and Ernst Koch in ''[[The Modern Language Journal]]''.{{sfn|Koch|1953|pages=59–60}} Later discussions include those by the intellectual historian [[Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen]] in ''Modern Intellectual History'',{{sfn|Ratner-Rosenhagen|2006|pages=239–269}} Axel Pérez Trujillo in ''Estudios Nietzsche: Revista de la Sociedad Española de Estudios sobre Friedrich Nietzsche'',{{sfn|Trujillo|2013|pages=107–118}} and Mark Alfano in the ''[[British Journal for the History of Philosophy]]''.{{sfn|Alfano|2013|pages=767–790}} In ''[[The Journal of Nietzsche Studies]]'', the book received discussions from David Pickus,{{sfn|Pickus|2007|pages=5–24}} Schacht,{{sfn|Schacht|2012|pages=69–70}} and the philosopher [[Robert B. Pippin]].{{sfn|Pippin|2014|pages=118–133}}

Watson considered the book one of the most important works on Nietzsche, crediting Kaufmann with thoroughly developing an "interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy sharply at variance with the usual ones." He suggested that Kaufmann's suggestion that Socrates was "Nietzsche's idol" to be perhaps his most "startling thesis".{{sfn|Watson|1951|pages=231–232}} Copleston described the book as "a most thoughtful, fair and scholarly treatment of Nietzsche's philosophy", welcoming the fact that it was free from both prejudice against and "sickening adulation" of Nietzsche. He praised Kaufmann for interpreting Nietzsche's statements in terms of both their context and the general development of Nietzsche's thought. However, he suggested that Kaufmann "plays down too much certain aspects of Nietzsche's thought".{{sfn|Copleston|1952|pages=367–368}} Cerf described the book as brilliant, and wrote that it caused him to re-examine the generally accepted ideas about Nietzsche he formerly held. He credited Kaufmann with exposing numerous false characterizations of Nietzsche and his views, and saw great merit in Kaufmann's discussion of Nietzsche's relation to other writers and thinkers. However, he questioned Kaufmann's understanding of the will to power, and suggested that Kaufmann overstated the extent to which the prevailing view of Nietzsche was false.{{sfn|Cerf|1951|pages=287–291}} Birx described the book as a "classic work", and credited Kaufmann with clearly presenting Nietzsche's life and thought, and carefully interpreting his ideas. Writing in 1977, he commented that it remained an "outstanding and indispensable contribution to Nietzschean scholarship."{{sfn|Birx|1977|pages=432–433}}

Ratner-Rosenhagen described the book as a "monumental study". She credited Kaufmann with transforming the interpretation of Nietzsche in the postwar United States and establishing him as "a canonical thinker in the Western tradition". She wrote that the book made Kaufmann himself a "dominant figure in transatlantic Nietzsche studies from 1950 until his death in 1980", and that while Kaufmann has been typically credited by philosophers and historians with saving Nietzsche's reputation by disassociating him from Nazism, they argue that he did so by "denaturing Nietzsche's philosophy of power and narrowly transforming him into an existentialist." In her view, Kaufmann "took a much more dramatic step by extending the scope of Nietzsche's philosophy, demonstrating how his ideas resonated with but also transcended the dominant philosophies of the day."{{sfn|Ratner-Rosenhagen|2006|pages=239–269}}

Alfano wrote that Kaufmann popularized the idea that Nietzsche was a [[Virtue ethics|virtue theorist]] in ethics. He maintained that Kaufmann was mistaken to argue that Nietzsche's concept of the overman is related to the Aristotelian conception of ''megalopsychia'' or "great-souled man", following Bernd Magnus's view that there is only a "superficial connection" between the two.{{sfn|Alfano|2013|pages=767–790}} Pickus argued that the book should be understood in relation to Jaspers's ''Nietzsche: An Introduction to the Understanding of His Philosophical Activity'' (1935), arguing that despite some differences, such as their views of the meaning of nihilism, they had much in common. He credited Kaufmann with helping make it possible to "identify irresponsible examples of Nietzsche scholarship" and initiating "a key debate about the possibility of using Nietzsche for moral “transfiguration,” particularly in historical, social, and artistic realms."{{sfn|Pickus|2007|pages=5–24}} Schacht commented that the book was "enormously influential", but that it was oriented to "strategic considerations, relating to Nietzsche’s rehabilitation in the English-speaking world", and presented Nietzsche as an existentialist. He credited Kaufmann with correctly emphasizing that Nietzsche was a philosopher, in opposition to a once prevailing view that Nietzsche did not deserve to be so considered. He also considered Kaufmann's characterization of Nietzsche as a psychologist apt. However, he questioned Kaufmann's characterization of Nietzsche as an "Antichrist", writing that it reflected Kaufmann's personal loathing of Christianity.{{sfn|Schacht|2012|pages=69–70}} Pippin wrote that despite the "relative success" of the book, "the reception of Nietzsche in the Anglo-American philosophical community was still in its initial, hesitant stages" even as late as 1985.{{sfn|Pippin|2014|pages=118–133}}

===Evaluations in books===
The sociologist [[Philip Rieff]] called ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' the best book in English on Nietzsche in ''[[Freud: The Mind of the Moralist]]'' (1959).{{sfn|Rieff|1961|page=413}} Schacht called ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' important and useful in ''Nietzsche'' (1983).{{sfn|Schacht|1985|page=xvi}} Kaufmann maintained in the fourth edition of ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' (1974) that he had succeeded in dissociating Nietzsche from Nazism and showing that Nietzsche was a great philosopher.{{sfn|Kaufmann|2013|page=xi}} The historian [[Peter Gay]] called ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' "epoch making" in the second volume of ''The Bourgeois Experience Victoria to Freud'' (1986). He credited Kaufmann with "correcting horrendous misreadings and pillorying appalling mistranslations", but noted that Kaufmann's conclusions have themselves been subjected to criticism and correction by later scholarship.{{sfn|Gay|1986|page=430}} The historian [[Roy Porter]] described ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' as "authoritative" in ''A Social History of Madness'' (1987).{{sfn|Porter|1989|page=246}}

Michael Tanner called ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' an "ill-organized transformation of Nietzsche into a liberal humanist" in ''Nietzsche'' (1994). However, he acknowledged that the book "had its place in the history of Nietzsche reception".{{sfn|Tanner|1994|page=82}} Schacht described ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' as a classic study through which many English-speaking readers became interested in and acquainted with Nietzsche after [[World War II]] in his 1996 introduction to Nietzsche's ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (1878). He wrote that it had little competition for nearly two decades and credited Kaufmann with offering  "a readable interpretation of Nietzsche's thought along humanistic existentialist and pragmatist lines". However, he criticized Kaufmann's treatment of ''Human, All Too Human'', ''[[The Dawn of Day|Daybreak]]'' (1881), and ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (1887), maintaining that Kaufmann incorrectly saw them as part of a period in Nietzsche's thought that was of little intrinsic interest.{{sfn|Schacht|1996|pages=xiii–xiv, xxix}}

Nehamas described ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' as a major turning point in Nietzsche's posthumous reputation in an introduction to its 2013 edition. He credited Kaufmann with reversing the popular image of Nietzsche as a totalitarian [[Antisemitism|anti-semite]], making it possible for philosophers to take Nietzsche seriously, and ensuring that Nietzsche's works have a prominent place in the philosophy sections of modern bookstores. He observed that Kaufmann's view that Nietzsche was an heir to rationalism rather than a Romantic critic of the Enlightenment is the most controversial element of his interpretation. He concluded that there is some truth to the charge that Kaufmann, in trying to reverse the "legend" surrounding Nietzsche, went too far in the opposite direction, over-emphasizing the more acceptable aspects of Nietzsche and minimizing the problematic or disturbing aspects, but that this does not detract from Kaufmann's accomplishment. In his view, Kaufmann's selective reinterpretation of Nietzsche may have been necessary to make it possible for Nietzsche to be read seriously by both philosophers and the general public, and his book repays careful study.{{sfn|Nehamas|2013|pages=v–ix}}

'''Noble Silence''' is a term attributed to the [[Buddha Gautama]], for his reported responses to certain questions about reality. One such instance is when he was asked the [[fourteen unanswerable questions]]. In similar situations he often responded to antinomy-based descriptions of reality by saying that both antithetical options presented to him were inappropriate. 

This does not indicate [[misology]] or disdain for philosophy on the Buddha's part. Rather, it indicates that he viewed these questions as not leading to true knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Gadjin M. Nagao, ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Leslie S. Kawamura, translator, SUNY Press, Albany 1991, pages 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dependent origination]] is one of the Buddha's great contributions to philosophy, and provides a framework for analysis of reality that is not based on metaphysical assumptions regarding existence or non-existence, but instead on direct cognition of phenomena as they are presented to the mind. This informs and supports the Buddhist approach to liberation via ethical and meditative training known as the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

==Pali Canon==

While [[silence]] is generally thought to be something observable on the outside of a person, an external state, whether they are talking, in the [[Pali Canon]] noble is an internal state which is synonymous with [[jhana]].

"But what is noble silence?' Then the thought occurred to me, 'There is the case where a monk, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, [1] enters &amp; remains in the second jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation — internal assurance. This is called noble silence.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn21/sn21.001.than.html |title=Kolita Sutta: Kolita  |date=2012 |website=Access To Insight |access-date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the eight jhanas, in the second jhana is when the inner dialog goes silent during meditation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9096">"'''Of Miracles'''" is the title of Section X of [[David Hume]]'s ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748).

==Origins and text==
In the 19th-century edition of Hume's ''Enquiry'' (in [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Sir John Lubbock]]'s series, "One Hundred Books"), sections X and XI were omitted, appearing in an Appendix with the misleading explanation that they were normally left out of popular editions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Flew]], introduction to ''Of Miracles'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the two sections appear in the full text in modern editions, chapter X has also been published separately, both as a separate book and in collections.

In Hume's December 1737 letter to [[Henry Home]], in addition to describing how he went about "castrating" his ''Treatise'' so as to "give as little offence" to the religious, he had considered publishing the argument against miracles—as well as other anti-theistic arguments—as part of the ''Treatise'', but decided against it so as to not offend the religious sensibilities of readers.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Wright, "The ''Treatise'': Composition, Reception, and Response" ch. 1 in ''The Blackwell Guide to Hume's Treatise'' ed. Saul Traiger, 2006, {{ISBN|9781405115094}}, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The argument==
[[File:Hume's maxim.jpg|thumb]]

Hume starts by telling the reader that he believes that he has "discovered an argument [...] which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion".&lt;ref&gt;Hume, ''An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding'' X, i, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume first explains the principle of evidence: the only way that we can judge between two empirical claims is by weighing the evidence. The degree to which we believe one claim over another is proportional to the degree by which the evidence for one outweighs the evidence for the other. The weight of evidence is a function of such factors as the reliability, manner, and number of witnesses.

Now, a [[miracle]] is defined as: "a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent."&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit., X, i, 90n&lt;/ref&gt; [[Physical law|Laws of nature]], however, are established by "a firm and unalterable experience";&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.'', X, i, 90&lt;/ref&gt; they rest upon the exceptionless testimony of countless people in different places and times.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing is esteemed a miracle, if it ever happen in the common course of nature. It is no miracle that a man, seemingly in good health, should die on a sudden: because such a kind of death, though more unusual than any other, has yet been frequently observed to happen. But it is a miracle, that a dead man should come to life; because that has never been observed in any age or country.&lt;ref name="loc. cit"&gt;''loc. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the evidence for a miracle is always limited, as miracles are single events, occurring at particular times and places, the evidence for the miracle will always be outweighed by the evidence against &amp;ndash; the evidence for the law of which the miracle is supposed to be a transgression.

There are, however, two ways in which this argument might be neutralised. First, if the number of witnesses of the miracle be greater than the number of witnesses of the operation of the law, and secondly, if a witness be 100% reliable (for then no amount of contrary testimony will be enough to outweigh that person's account). Hume therefore lays out, in the second part of section X, a number of reasons that we have for never holding this condition to have been met. He first claims that no miracle has in fact had enough witnesses of sufficient honesty, intelligence, and education. He goes on to list the ways in which human beings lack complete reliability:
* People are very prone to accept the unusual and incredible, which excite agreeable passions of surprise and wonder.
* Those with strong religious beliefs are often prepared to give evidence that they know is false, "with the best intentions in the world, for the sake of promoting so holy a cause".&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.'' X, ii, 93&lt;/ref&gt;
* People are often too credulous when faced with such witnesses, whose apparent honesty and eloquence (together with the psychological effects of the marvellous described earlier) may overcome normal scepticism.
* Miracle stories tend to have their origins in "ignorant and barbarous nations"&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.'' X, ii, 94&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; either elsewhere in the world or in a civilised nation's past. The history of every culture displays a pattern of development from a wealth of supernatural events &amp;ndash; "[p]rodigies, omens, oracles, judgements"&lt;ref name="loc. cit"/&gt; &amp;ndash; which steadily decreases over time, as the culture grows in knowledge and understanding of the world.

Hume ends with an argument that is relevant to what has gone before, but which introduces a new theme: the [[argument from miracles]]. He points out that many different religions have their own miracle stories. Given that there is no reason to accept some of them but not others (aside from a prejudice in favour of one religion), then we must hold all religions to have been proved true &amp;ndash; but given the fact that religions contradict each other, this cannot be the case.

==Criticism==
[[R. F. Holland]] has argued that Hume's definition of "miracle" need not be accepted, and that an event need not violate a natural law in order to be accounted miraculous.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been argued by critics such as the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister [[George Campbell (Presbyterian minister)|George Campbell]], that Hume's argument is circular.  That is, he rests his case against belief in miracles upon the claim that laws of nature are supported by exceptionless testimony, but testimony can only be accounted exceptionless if we discount the occurrence of miracles.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;George Campbell, A dissertation on miracles, pp. 31–32, London: T. Tegg, 1824 [https://archive.org/details/adissertationon01campgoog]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[John Earman]] has recently argued that Hume's argument is "largely unoriginal and chiefly without merit where it is original",&lt;ref&gt;Earman, ''Hume's Abject Failure'', Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; citing Hume's lack of understanding of the probability calculus as a major source of error. [[J. P. Moreland]] and [[William Lane Craig]] agree with Earman's basic assessment and have critiqued Hume's argument against being able to identify miracles by stating that Hume's theory "fails to take into account all the probabilities involved" and "he incorrectly assumes that miracles are intrinsically highly improbable" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview|last = Moreland|first = J. P. | authorlink = J. P. Moreland |publisher = InterVarsity Press Academic|year = 2003|isbn = 0-830-82694-7|location = Downers Grove, IL|pages = 569–70|last2 = Craig|first2 = William Lane| author2link = William Lane Craig }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles: A Preliminary Study]]'', argues that Hume begins by [[begging the question]]. He says that his initial proposition - that laws of nature cannot be broken - is effectively the same question as 'Do miracles occur?'.

The '''Pargo Kaling''' ({{bo|t=བར་སྒོ་བཀག་གླིང|w=bar sgo bkag gling}}) was a large [[chorten]] straddling across the road leading from [[Drepung]] between the [[Potala]]'s Red Hill (Marpori) and the Iron Hill ([[Chagpori]]) at [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]], and containing a through-passage or archway for people and animals. It formed the "Western Gate" of the city and led into the village of [[Shol]]. It was destroyed in 1967&lt;ref name="AndAlex"&gt;[[André Alexander]], [https://books.google.fr/books?id=K9B0AW4Urs0C&amp;pg=PA54 ''The Traditional Lhasa House: Typology of an Endangered Species''], LIT Verlag Münster, 2013, 409 pages, p. 54: "In 1948, [...] There were no more city walls, but two gates. One was the Drakgo-kaling, a gate consisting of three stupa monuments located between the Potala Palace and Chakpori Hill (demolished in 1967 and rebuilt in 1995). The other was located at the western edge of the central urban cluster, from where one had to cross a bridge and pass by the important Western Rigsum Gonpo temple in order to reach the Potala."&lt;/ref&gt; but the Lhasa authorities had it rebuilt in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Clare Harris, ''The Museum of the Roof of the World: Art, Politics, and the Representation of Tibet'', University of Chicago Press, 2012, 314 p., p. 199: "The Lhasa authorities have made some attempt to reinstate it [the view] by rebuilding the three stupas of the Pargo Kaling (Western Gate) that was destroyed in the 1960s."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianart.com/lhasa_restoration/map/map2.html  Lhasa map: 1980]: "In 1980, [...] The old city gate, in the form of a Buddhist stupa, has disappeared."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianart.com/lhasa_restoration/map/map3.html Lhasa Map: 1998]: "A replica of the old city gate has been built at the original site."&lt;/ref&gt;

As shown by photographs taken in 1904 and 1938, the Pargo Kaling chorten was one of three chortens: a second one was perched on the low ridge of Marpori and a third one stood on the low ridge of Chagpori.&lt;ref name="AndAlex"/&gt; From the top of the middle chorten, wires furnished with small bells were stretched to the top of the two smaller chortens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.lib.uwm.edu/digital/collection/tibet/id/139 Lhasa, Bar Chorten, the Western Gate or Pargo Kaling gateway], Tibet - from the collection of the American Geographical Society Library, University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==
The Tibetan name of the Western Gate has several variants besides Pargo Kaling: Pawogaling ([[Peter Aufschnaiter]]&lt;ref&gt;''Eight Years in Tibet'', Bangkok, Orchid Press, 2002, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;), Drakgo Kaling (André Alexander&lt;ref&gt;''The Traditional Lhasa House: Typology of an Endangered Species'', LIT Verlag Münster, 2013, 409 pages, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;), Barkokani or Bakokani (G.

The oldest known representation of the Pargo Kaling Gate is found on a map of the city of Lhasa drawn by [[Hyacinth (Bichurin)|Nikita Bichurin]] in the first half of the 19th century.

He was accompanied by all the members of the mission, the war correspondents, and an escort of two companies of the Royal Fusiliers and the 2nd Mounted Infantry."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pargo Kaling chorten was also depicted in a scene of the 1997 movie ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]'', which was the adaptation of the ''[[Seven Years in Tibet|book of that title]]'' by [[Heinrich Harrer]].

== A song to the Western Gate ==
In the 1980s, the lost Western Gate inspired a song sung by Tibetan singer Dadon. The lyrics of the first verse and the chorus go like this: 

''In front of the Potala Palace / There were three beloved stupas / Whenever the wind stirred the chimes / What resounding music there was / How melodious it sounded.''&lt;br&gt;

''Aah stupa Drago Kaling / Aah, in my mind I suddenly remember / In the depth of my heart I suddenly remember you.''

'''''Passion: An Essay on Personality''''' is a philosophical inquiry into [[human nature]] by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. The book explores the individual and his relation to society, asking how one comes to an understanding of self and others. Unger here sees the root human predicament as the need to establish oneself as a unique individual in the world but at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context.

Unger’s aim is twofold. First, to level a critique, expansion, and defense of modern thinking about the human and society “so that this practice can better withstand the criticisms that philosophy since [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] has leveled against it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; And second, to develop a prescriptive theory of human identity centered on what Unger calls [[Passions (philosophy)|the passions]]—our raw responses to the world that are ambivalent towards reasons but also act in the service of reason. He outlines nine passions that organize and are organized by our dealings with others: lust, despair, hatred, vanity, jealousy, envy, faith, hope, and love. While these emotional states may be seen as raw emotion, their expression is always conditioned by the context within which the individual mobilizes or learns to mobilize them.

The book was critically hailed as successfully grappling with some of the most fundamental and enduring problems of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=February 1985|volume=83|issue=4|pages=768–771|doi=10.2307/1288775}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been put into direct dialogue with Kant's moral law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weirib|first=Ernest J.|title=Enduring Passion|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=June 1985|volume=94|issue=7|pages=1825–1841}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said to have provided one answer to [[Hume's Guillotine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1066-`083|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unger's analysis and the program he builds around this revolutionary understanding has also inspired new thinking and approaches to psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=791–816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Entering into a long philosophical tradition of inquiry into human nature, Unger begins by categorically rejecting the idea of a natural order to the world or a natural state of human organization. For Unger, there are no natural laws. Rather, he takes to the hilt the modernist thesis that we are shaped by context but not bound by context. As such, we have the power to work both within and beyond any constraints of social or cultural binds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Social Theory|year=2004|publisher=Verso|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This perspective is derived from the Christian-Romantic tradition. Unger argues that this tradition has two themes: interpersonal relations with love as the redemptive moment, and that a person's identity is not defined by membership in social ranks and division. This then gives expression to the idea that humans are never at home in the world and that they are constantly striving to remake the world. The modernist development takes up this theme but emphasizes interpersonal relations over impersonal reality or good so that no institutional settings can limit the possibilities of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; We “can assert [our] independence only by perpetual war against the fact of contextually…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normative force ===
In laying forth a view of human nature and prescription of self-affirmation, Unger recognizes that he faces the predicament of employing one system of thought that has developed out of particular historical circumstances and is thus no better or worse than any other system of thought. Indeed, under what auspices can such a philosophical orientation be turned into a normative prescription?

Unger turns this question from one of general principles to one of the enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="Unger 48"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.&lt;ref name="Unger 48"/&gt;

Unger looks closely at existential projects that fail: the heroic ethic (delusional about historic setting, which negates the ethic), and the impersonal absolute ethic ([[Buddhism]], which tries but cannot divest itself of the world). Both respond to the fact of the individual not being the center of the world. However, by doing so they disengage from the world and others. While [[Confucianism]] addresses interdependence, the philosophy elevates it to a level of canonical hierarchy and thus imposes strict constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Towards a psychology of empowerment ===
Unger sees the Christian-Romantic tradition as the one tradition that puts the individual at the center of the world and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to the defeat of the imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Passion begins with a long introductory foray into the [[Western philosophical tradition]] of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger that is at the heart of our relations with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion is at the heart of this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.&lt;ref name="BJ 1070"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1070|doi=10.2307/1340886|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5799&amp;context=faculty_scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part two, Unger attempts to explain how one becomes capable of passion. He charts out a path by which the individual first has desire, which is then augmented with imagination. The imagination reveals an insatiability of the infinite sense of self, which is but then contingent upon the acceptance of others. With this recognition, then, the contingency of the self is revealed. With the further realization of death we come to see that nothing outside of the self can fulfill desire; we want to see the self as transcending all of the fixed social world.

In part three, Unger addresses the passions themselves. As James Glass in ''Political Psychology'' writes, "Not only do these passions civilize and humanize experience; their practice transcends social status, framework, and stratification. Existing beyond class and history, they possess an autonomy that resists the disintegrative pull of power and self-interest, the historical and social differences induced by envy, jealousy, pride, and vanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glass|first=James|title=Review|journal=Political Psychology|date=December 1986|volume=7|issue=4|pages=799|doi=10.2307/3791216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unger describes each one in a way that brings out the need-danger antinomy and the context dependent-transcended dichotomy.&lt;ref name="BJ 1070"/&gt;

* Lust and despair are proto-social destructive forces that must be tamed for civil order to ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Hatred, vanity, jealousy, and envy underscore failures to accept one another's presence in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Faith, hope, and love resolve conflicts that seemed insoluble and break through barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part four charts the task ahead, which Unger says is to find the collective equivalents to the personal experiences of love, faith, and hope. We must strive to discover the structures that can realize these passions in the everyday world. All too often visions of the future human and environment exclude from social life the personal connections represented in the passions, choosing instead to focus on the recreation of the material world. Unger’s call, however, is to take full account of the passions so we may transcend our context and become more godlike.&lt;ref name="MLR 771"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=February 1985|volume=83|issue=4|pages=771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book’s appendix is "A Program for Late Twentieth-Century Psychiatry," an apropos article previously published in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=A Program for Late Twentieth-Century Psychiatry|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=February 1982|volume=139|issue=2|pages=155–164|doi=10.1176/ajp.139.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose argument can be summed up as "psychoanalytic theory offers opportunities to replicate, but not to transform, individual and social contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1071|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book has been met with critical but high acclaim in both legal and philosophical circles. In his ''Times'' review, Jerome Neu, celebrated the book as "some of the most brilliant writing of this kind since Hegel."  Other reviewers have similarly praised it for its "heretical presence both in contemporary social science and philosophy, a point of view that refuses both the "scorched earth campaign of radical skepticism" and the limitations of a social and political theory that roots meaning in transcendental or metaphysical absolutes."&lt;ref name="GJ 802"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glass|first=James|title=Review|journal=Political Psychology|date=December 1986|volume=7|issue=4|pages=802|doi=10.2307/3791216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet reviewers have also expressed reservations over "Unger's style, his normative reflections, his erudition and elusiveness."&lt;ref name="GJ 802"/&gt; The ''Michigan Law Review'' asked for a more concrete articulation of Unger's idea, claiming that he left both his idea of the individual and program for psychiatry too ambiguous. "That Unger's best society would be a place of playfulness and laughter is, however, only implicit in Passion, and Unger's failure to describe the mirthfulness of the world of love exemplifies the speculative tone that marks the central failure of the work as a whole."&lt;ref name="MLR 771"/&gt; Similarly, James Boyle in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' said that the speculative philosophy detracted from the effectiveness of the message, and thought the argument would have been better served with personal example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1083|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Allan Hobson, in the pages of the ''Northwestern University Law Review'', capitalized on the inspiration of Unger's thesis to develop a new psychiatric program in "advanc[ing] from a set of slogans to testable hypotheses."&lt;ref name="Hobson 792"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=792}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised Unger for pinpointing the root of the problem--"Psychoanalysis is out of gas, and biological psychiatry is not yet up to speed. As a field in crisis, psychiatry is ripe for change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=791}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but found Unger's theory of personality and program "hopelessly inadequate" because it was too speculative and failed to address biological data.&lt;ref name="Hobson 792"/&gt; Hobson attempted to develop a theory that would incorporate this biological data.

'''Robert Kilwardby''' ([[circa|c.]] 1215&amp;nbsp;– 11 September 1279) was an [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in England and a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. Kilwardby was the first member of a [[mendicant order]] to attain a high ecclesiastical office in the English Church.

==Life==
Kilwardby studied at the [[University of Paris]], then was a teacher of [[grammar]] and [[logic]] there. He then joined the [[Dominican Order]] and studied [[theology]],&lt;ref name=Lawrence146&gt;Lawrence "Thirteenth Century" ''English Church and the Papacy'' p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; and became regent at [[Oxford University]] before 1261,&lt;ref name=Thought288&gt;Knowles ''Evolution of Medieval Thought'' p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; probably by 1245.&lt;ref name=Leff290&gt;Leff ''Paris and Oxford Universities'' pp. 290–293&lt;/ref&gt; He was named [[provincial superior|provincial]] [[prior]] of the Dominicans for England in 1261,&lt;ref name=BHOCant&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=33853 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Canterbury: Archbishops]''&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 1272 Pope [[Pope Gregory X|Gregory X]] appointed him as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] to end a dispute over the election. Kilwardby was provided to the archbishopric on 11 October 1272, given the temporalities on 12 December 1272, and consecrated on 26 February 1273.&lt;ref name=Handbook233&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Kilwardby crowned [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and his wife [[Eleanor of Castile|Eleanor]] as king and queen of England in August 1274, but otherwise took little part in politics. He instead concentrated on his ecclesiastical duties, including charity to the poor and donating to the Dominicans.&lt;ref name=Moorman371&gt;Moorman ''Church Life'' p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1278 Pope [[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]] named Kilwardby [[Cardinal Bishop of Porto and Santa Rufina]].&lt;ref name=Princes173&gt;Bellenger and Fletcher ''Princes of the Church'' p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; He then resigned Canterbury and left England,&lt;ref name=Handbook233/&gt; taking with him papers, registers and documents belonging to the see. He also left the see deep in debt again, after his predecessor had cleared the debt.&lt;ref name=Moorman173&gt;Moorman ''Church Life'' p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Italy in 1279 and was buried in the Dominican convent in Viterbo, Italy.&lt;ref name=Princes173/&gt; While in theory this was a promotion, probably it was not, as the pope was unhappy with Kilwardby's support of efforts to resist the payment of papal revenues and with the lack of effort towards the reforms demanded at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1274.&lt;ref name=Edward249&gt;Prestwich ''Edward I'' p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Kilwardby's theological and philosophical views were summed up by [[David Knowles (scholar)|David Knowles]] who said that he was a "conservative eclectic, holding the doctrine of seminal tendencies and opposing...the Aristotelian doctrine of the unity of form in beings, including man."&lt;ref name=Thought249&gt;Knowles ''Evolution of Medieval Thought'' p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state that he was the author of ''Summa Philosophiae'', a history and description of the schools of philosophical thought then current, but the writing style is not similar to his other works, and Knowles, for one, does not believe it was authored by Kilwardby.&lt;ref name=Thought287&gt;Knowles ''Evolution of Medieval Thought'' p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been alleged that Kilwardby was an opponent of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. In 1277 he prohibited the teaching of thirty theses, some of which have been thought to touch upon Thomas Aquinas' teaching. Recent scholars, however, such as Roland Hissette, have challenged this interpretation.&lt;ref name=Burton206&gt;Burton,''Monastic and Religious Orders'' pp. 206–207&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salvador Minguijón Adrián''' (1874-1959) was a Spanish law scholar, political theorist and politician. As a lawyer he is known mostly as a longtime academic in the [[University of Zaragoza]] and briefly member of the [[Supreme Court of Spain|Spanish constitutional court]]. As a theorist he is considered one of key representatives of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]]. As a politician he is recognized as associated with [[Carlism]], [[Christian Democracy]], [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primoderiverismo]], [[Social Catholicism]] and early [[Francoism]].

==Family and youth==
[[File:Vista de Calatayud desde la iglesia de La Peña, España, 2012-08-24, DD 02.JPG|thumb|left|[[Calatayud]]]]
Juan Salvador Minguijón Adrián was descendant to an [[Aragon]]ese family of petty officials and artisans. His paternal ancestors originated from the village of [[Terrer]] in South-Western Aragon, where Salvador's grandfather worked as a primary school teacher;&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco Baltar Rodriguez, ''Minguijón y Adrián, Juan Salvador (1874-1959)'', [in:] ''Diccionario de catedráticos españoles de derecho'' online, 2014, available [http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/instituto_figuerola/programas/phu/diccionariodecatedraticos/lcatedraticos/jsminguijon here]&lt;/ref&gt; his son and Salvador's father, [[Jorge Minguijón Cacho]]&lt;ref&gt;''La Unión Católica'' 21.05.90, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004878726&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; (died 1895),&lt;ref&gt;''El Movimiento Católico'' 31.12.95, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0025558333&amp;page=7 here]&lt;/ref&gt; was a local administrative clerk.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At unspecified date he married María Antonia Adrián Martínez, herself from the nearby [[Calatayud]]. Her family originated from [[Visiedo]] in another Aragonese [[province of Teruel]];&lt;ref&gt;though they lived in Calatayud, Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Salvador's maternal grandfather worked as a carpenter.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had at least two sons, though exact number of their children is not clear.

Salvador and his brother were raised in a profoundly religious ambience; his father was a local Catholic activist&lt;ref&gt;''La Unión Católica'' 21.05.90&lt;/ref&gt; and his brother was to become a friar.&lt;ref&gt;''El Salmantino'' 05.09.17, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=5041979&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Following childhood spent in Calatayud the young Salvador entered a diocesan seminary in [[Zaragoza]], a path typically leading to a career of a priest or a school teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Díaz Díaz, ''Minguijón Adrián, Salvador'', [in:] ''Hombres y documentos de la filosofía española'', vol 5, Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|9788400075040}}, p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; Having completed the schooling at unspecified time he enrolled at [[Universidad de Zaragoza]], commencing learning at the faculty of Filosofía y Letras, where he completed the curriculum and graduated in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco Baltar Rodriguez, ''Los ejercisios de oposiciones a profesor auxiliar de Salvador Minguijón'', [in:] ''European Journal of Legal History'' 10 (2013), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to Madrid to pursue studies in law at [[:es:Universidad de Madrid|Universidad Central]]; having been awarded a [[Cum laude|Cum Laude diploma]] in 1900, Minguijón continued with doctoral research.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 Minguijón commenced the career of a lawyer becoming a notary in [[Sabiñán]], a municipio in the comarca of Calatayud. In 1905 he switched to the same role in [[Brea de Aragón|Brea]], a slightly larger location in the [[Aranda (comarca)|comarca of Aranda]],&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Díaz 1995, p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; where he probably practiced very shortly as he soon commenced academic duties in Zaragoza. In 1906 Minguijón obtained [[PhDs|PhD laurels]] in Madrid; his thesis, titled ''La responsabilidad civil extracontractual'', was considered excellent by the jury.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Paracuellos Fosa III.JPG|thumb|[[Paracuellos de Jarama]] cemetery]]
At unspecified time Salvador Minguijón married Ana-María Paraíso Ferruz;&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 12.07.35, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1935/07/12/055.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; none of the sources consulted provides any information on his wife. The couple had 4 children: Carmen, Agustín, María Luisa and María Antonia.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 12.05.35&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in Zaragoza, though in the mid-1930s they moved to [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Díaz 1995, p. 530&lt;/ref&gt; Minguijón spent his declining years alone: his brother died in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;''El Salmantino'' 05.09.17&lt;/ref&gt; his wife widowed him middle-aged in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 12.07.35&lt;/ref&gt; one daughter became a [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelitan]] [[nun]] and has never left the monastery, the only son, a leading activist of [[:es:Asociación Católica de Propagandistas|Asociación Católica Nacional de Propagandistas]],&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Orella Martínez, ''El origen del primer Catolicismo social Español'' [PhD thesis, Universidad de Educación a Distancia], Madrid 2012, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; was executed by the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] in [[Paracuellos massacres|Paracuellos de Jarama]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;''Agustín Minguijón Paraíso (1907-1936)'' [in:] ''Asociacion Catolica de Progapandistas'' service, available [http://www.acdp.es/agustin-minguijon-paraiso-1907-1936/ here]; there is a monograph dedicated to Minguijón Paraíso, see José Vicente Rodríguez, ''Le troncharon en la flor de la vida. Agustín Minguijón Paraíso. Datos biográficos y martirios (1907-1936)'', Zaragoza 2009, {{ISBN|9788483532454}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another daughter died in the mid-1940s.&lt;ref&gt;referred after Rafael Gambra, ''Aspectos del pensamiento de Salvador Minguijón'', [in:] ''Revista international de sociologia'' 67 (1959), p. 85; it is not clear what happened to his third daughter&lt;/ref&gt; Minguijón passed away in Zaragoza,&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; en route to his usual summer holiday location in [[Irún]].&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurist: academic and official==
[[File:Paraninfo Zaragoza 1.JPG|thumbnail|left|[[Zaragoza University]]]]
In 1904-1905 Minguijón applied to a number of secondary education institutions in Zaragoza, but his bids for chairs of geography,&lt;ref&gt;chairs of geografía descriptiva general de Europa y de España in Instituto de Mahón (Zaragoza) and Instituto de Baeza (Zaragoza)&lt;/ref&gt; history,&lt;ref&gt;chairs of historia de España e historia universal in Instituto de Mahón and Instituto de Baeza&lt;/ref&gt; letters,&lt;ref&gt;lengua y literatura castellana in Instituto de Baeza&lt;/ref&gt; Latin&lt;ref&gt;chairs of Latin language in Instituto de Canarias (Zaragoza) and in Instituto de Figueras (Zaragoza)&lt;/ref&gt; and law&lt;ref&gt;chair of psicología, lógica, ética y rudimentos de Derecho in Instituto de Teruel (Zaragoza)&lt;/ref&gt; proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he was accepted at temporary unpaid job of professor auxiliar at Facultad de Derecho of the Zaragoza University;&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt; the same year he defeated 5 counter-candidates and won the contest for professor auxiliar interino retribuido del segundo grupo,&lt;ref&gt;detailed discussion of academic contest in Baltar Rodriguez 2013, pp. 71-87&lt;/ref&gt; assuming regular teaching duties in 1906. In 1907 he was promoted to professor auxiliar numerario de segundo grupo.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he filled the vacancy in Historia General del Derecho Español as assistant professor.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 he applied for Historia General del Derecho in [[Universidad de Valladolid]], but it is not clear whether he took part in usual contest for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 he emerged victorious from the contest for chair of Historia General del Derecho in Zaragoza, thus terminating the period of junior assignments and assuming a major academic position.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Díaz 1995, p. 529, Baltar Rodriguez 2014, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Minguijón served as head of history of law in Zaragoza almost for the following quarter of the century, his position in national realm of jurisprudence scholars enhanced following publication of a series of textbooks in the 1910s and especially his major work, ''Historia del Derecho Español'', issued in 1927. Since the mid-1910s he was being invited as jury member in contests for academic chairs, held across Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Facultad de Derecho de Santiago de Compostela (1915) and cátedra de Historia del Derecho de la Universidad de Murcia (1919), Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1930s he was already a distinguished law academic, known beyond the scientific milieu thanks to his numerous press contributions. Minguijón's juridical career was crowned in 1933, when he was elected as an academic nominee to [[:es:Tribunal de Garantías Constitucionales (España)|Tribunal de Garantías Constitucionales]], the Spanish constitutional court.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The year marked also his departure from Zaragoza; he had to abandon the university chair as the new job required his presence in Madrid.
[[File:Tribunal Supremo de España (Madrid) 01.jpg|thumbnail|site of [[Supreme Court of Spain|Tribunal Supremo]]]]
Minguijón formally resigned from the anyway defunct Tribunal in September 1936; he returned to Zaragoza and resumed his university duties&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt; until in 1938&lt;ref&gt;''Minguijón y Adrián, Juan Salvador'' [in:] ''Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa'' online, available [http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=8834 here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed to the new Francoist high court, [[Supreme Court of Spain|Tribunal Supremo]].&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Madrid, in the early 1940s he chaired historia del derecho and sociología at Universidad Central.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Díaz 1995, p. 530&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 he entered the very elite of Spanish academics, becoming a member of the [[Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas]].&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, pp. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Minguijón resigned from all academic and official duties upon reaching the regular retirement age in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Already in the 1930s he used to collaborate with semi-scholarly institutions, notably giving lectures at [[Ateneo de Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1959, pp. 82-85&lt;/ref&gt; This activity gained momentum following his retirement, especially as he became vice-president of the 1943-established [[Instituto Balmes de Sociología]].&lt;ref&gt;Jesús Tobío Fernández, ''Salvador Minguijón Adrián'', [in:] ''Arbor'' 44 (1959), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Already in the early 1940s he engaged in works of [[:es:Institución Fernando el Católico|Institución Fernando el Católico]] of Zaragoza.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 he became one of the moving spirits behind the Madrid [[Colegio de Aragón]], set up by IFC as means of sustaining an Aragon identity,&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Alares López, Severino Aznar y el Colegio de Aragón (1945-1959), Zaragoza 2013, {{ISBN|9788499112657}}, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; scaling down his engagement after 1953.&lt;ref&gt;he was last noted as taking part in regular meeting in 1953, Alares López 2013, p. 267, for later years see Alares López 2013, p. 268 and onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
[[File:Alfonso X de Castilla (1255, edición 1543) Fuero Real de España.png| thumb|160px| left| ''Fuero Real'', 1543 (1255)]]
Minguijón's written heritage is one major work, around 20 booklets, tens of scientific articles and hundreds of press items. In terms of topics, his opus is described by a present-day-scholar as multi-faceted.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; It may be roughly divided into 4 groups: [[jurisprudence]], [[political thought]], [[social sciences]] and ongoing public issues.

His most recognized works are those dealing with [[history of law]]. From 1911 to the early 1920s Minguijón published booklets formatted as textbooks for students, completed as a 12-volume series titled ''Elementos de historia del derecho español'';&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; apart from synthesis and update of earlier works they were heavily based on own research, related in particular to medieval and foral Spanish legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The series was a basis for a massive monograph, ''Historia del derecho español'' (1927), the 500-page work which gained Minguijón his name and scientific posture. Re-issued in few editions, until the mid-1950s it served as academic manual for generations of Spanish students.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Minguijón's works on political thought were formatted mostly as pamphlets and booklets hardly exceeding 100 pages. The best known one, having been also chronologically the first, was ''La crisis del tradicionalismo en España'' (1914), a lecture of author's understanding of Traditionalism and its role in Spain of the era; it elevated the author to a prominent though controversial position within Carlism. It was followed by ''Humanismo y nacionalidad'' (1929), ''Al servicio de la Tradición'' (1930), ''La crisis de la libertad'' (1934), ''La Democracia'' (1934) and ''Los apologistas del siglo II'' (1936), all of them marking an attempt to transform Traditionalist outlook into a modern Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;he also father minor works, often focusing on specific individuals like Baltasar Gracián, Antonio Maura, Juan Moneva, see e.g. ''El sentido de la vida en la obras de Gracián'' [in:] ''Baltasar Gracián escritor aragonés del s. XVII'', Zaragoza 1926&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ULL.98.45.71.33.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[El Debate]]'', 1918]]
Minguijón's interest in social issues gradually developed into a hybrid in-between the science of [[sociology]] and theories of addressing social problems. It was first demonstrated in ''Las luchas del periodismo'' (1908), a discussion of social obligations of the press,&lt;ref&gt;the work despised subordination of intellectuals to the rule of capital, José Manuel Gonzalez Torga, ''Fenomenologia de los confidenciales como modalidad del periodismo'' [PhD thesis Complutense], Madrid 1994, p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''Hombres e ideas. Estudios sociales'' (1910), ''Propiedad y trabajo'' (1920), ''La función social de la propiedad'' (1930) and ''La Propiedad'' (1935) and combined with numerous articles in specialized reviews.&lt;ref&gt;especially ''Revista Católica de las cuestiones sociales''; the periodical he contributed to from 1911 to 1930. Compare also ''Sobre el objeto de la sociología'', [in:] ''Revista Internacional de Sociología'' 4/6 (1943-1944), ''La Cuestión de Progreso'' [in:] ''Revista Internacional de Sociología'', 8-9 (1944-1945), ''Vulgarización Sociológica, Opinión y Masa'' [in:] ''Revista Internacional de Sociología'' 19 (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; Some works fall rather into philosophy, as Minguijón strove to present a general background of Christian thought; they are either a handful of minor works published for limited audience&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''Lo racional y lo irracional en el mundo físico'' [in:] ''Arbor'' 9 (1945), ''En torno al Espacio'' [in:] ''Segunda Reunión de Aproximación Filosófico-Científica'', Zaragoza 1959, ''En torno a la Materia'' [in:] ''La Materia: III Reunión de Aproximación Filosófico-Científica',' Zaragoza 1961, ''La obra social de Costa'', Zaragoza 1926&lt;/ref&gt; or translations from German.&lt;ref&gt;Minguijón translated two works of Martin Grabmann: ''Filosofía medieval'' (1928) and ''Santo Tomás de Aquino'' (1930), and one of Robert F. Arnold, ''Cultura del Renacimiento'' (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

A numerically dominating group of Minguijón's writings are his press contributions, usually some 800-word commentaries dealing with ongoing public affairs. Far from partisan zeal and styled as impartial essays, within a wide public discourse they gained Minguijón recognition of a pundit. Starting the early 1910s he began to contribute to Catholic dailies across the country.&lt;ref&gt;like ''Heraldo Alaves'', ''El Salmantino'', ''Diario de Valencia'', ''La Gaceta de Tenerife'', ''Diario de Alicante'' or ''Diario de Reus''&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was particularly active writing to ''[[El Debate]]'' and emerged as key commentator of the Madrid daily. As during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] years ''El Debate'' became a semi-official [[CEDA]] mouthpiece, Minguijón, at that time member of the supreme national court, preferred to publish rather in various regional Catholic periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;''Region'', ''El bien publico'', ''Heraldo de Almeria'', ''El dia de Palencia'', ''Labor'', ''La Gaceta de Tenerife'' and others&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] and afterwards he did not resume his career of a press pundit.

==Carlist: ''minimismo''==
[[File:Salvador Minguijón.png|thumbnail|170px|left|Salvador Minguijón (1911)]]
Political preferences of Minguijón's father are not entirely clear, though he is known to have at least sympathized with Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;''La Regeneración'' 09.12.69, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026688647&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; A "Salvador Minguijón" from Calatayud was noted as signing a loyalist Carlist address in 1886,&lt;ref&gt;''El Cabecilla'' 04.12.89, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003848511&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; but for the first time he can be surely identified assuming public activity in 1897, taking part in local ecclesiastical educational initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz de la Provincia'' 03.04.97, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=2295057&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; He followed an apparent periodista zeal: in 1908 he took part in a Catholic Asamblea Nacional de Buena Prensa,&lt;ref&gt;''El Día de Palencia'' 30.09.08, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2191179&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; while in the 1910s co-founded and periodically managed socially minded Catholic periodicals, ''La paz social'',&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Díaz 1995, p. 530, Sergio Fernández Riquelme, ''Sociología, corporativismo y política social en España'' [PhD thesis Universidad de Murcia], Murcia 2008, p. 214. In 1913 he travelled across Europe to see the nascent Christian-Democratic initiatives first-hand, Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; ''El Noticiero''&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Díaz 1995, p. 530&lt;/ref&gt; and ''El Pilar''.&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 14.01.10, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000610641&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His Carlist leaning was reinforced at the University; in the early 20th century the Zaragoza Law Faculty was dominated by [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Jaimistas]] from the [[Jesus Comin Sagues|Comín]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Bienvenido Comín Sarté and Pascual Comín Moya&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was not noted as active within the Carlist realm until publication of ''La crisis del tradicionalismo en España'' in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;he is not a single time mentioned in a lengthy study on marques de Cerralbo, the most complete recent scholarly history of Carlism between the 1880s and 1910s, see Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

''La crisis'' claimed that Traditionalist dogma was perfectly valid, though it had to be renewed and its application re-defined; Minguijón viewed it not as a fixed set of principles, but as an adaptive approach to problems of human civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1959, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The practical conclusion was that the Carlists should seek alliance with all political forces sharing the same lowest common denominator. He advocated rapprochement with the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrists]], with [[Lliga Regionalista]] and with the [[Antonio Maura|Mauristas]]. Indeed, some claim that he subscribed to a "modelo maurrasiano", a new counter-revolutionary movement&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; exploring parliamentary opportunities to build a confessional, corporative and regional state;&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; others underline inspiration by the concept of Catholic unity, launched by ACNDP and pursued by its freshly set up daily, ''El Debate''.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, pp. 106, 115&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance implied that the Carlists should soften their approach to [[Catalanism]], up to recognition of separate Catalan legislation and administration,&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Umierać ale powoli'', Kraków 2002, {{ISBN|8386225742}}, p. 288, Orella Martínez 2012, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; and park their dynastical claims.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2002, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider Minguijón's strategy a reference to [[Sexenio Democrático]], when Carlism served as agglutinatory factor for conservative forces;&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; it was supposed to lay path for peaceful transformation of liberal monarchy into a traditionalist one.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863820}}, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy presented was dubbed "minimismo"&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 267, Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 83, 247, 248&lt;/ref&gt; or "minimismo tradicionalista".&lt;ref&gt;José Andrés Gallego, Antón M. Pazos (eds.), ''Archivo Gomá: Febrero de 1937'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|9788400080570}}, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jaime de Borbón y Borbón-Parma.png|thumb|[[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]], 1910s]]
Within Carlism Minguijón's proposal was appreciated as an elaborated and genuine attempt to revitalize the movement, though the critics pointed out that it would be another version of [[:es:Alejandro Pidal y Mon|Pidalismo]],&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2002, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; an opportunist amalgamation of Traditionalism within a broad conservative spectrum. They lambasted it as "reducción grave y transcendental de las bases más esenciales de nuestra Comunión"&lt;ref&gt;opinion of Mariano Fortuny, quoted after Canal 2000, p. 268, see also Andrés Martín 2000, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; and amputation of Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics offered a competitive diagnosis, namely that the crisis of Carlism was caused by the deadly virus of parliamentarism.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Following a period of hesitation, in 1915 Minimismo was eventually disavowed by the claimant [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]], who confirmed intransigence on dynastical issues and permitted at best neutral approach towards moderate Catalanism of La Lliga.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2002, p. 288; opposite view in Andrés Martín 2000, p. 84, namely that Don Jaime himself reduced dynastic thread to secondary position&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mellismo'' and Partido Social Popular==
[[File:Juan Vazquez de Mella 1906.JPG|thumb|160px|left|[[Juan Vázquez de Mella]]]]
In the 1910s Carlism was dominated by a conflict between the claimant and the key party theorist, [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]]. At a first glance Minimismo and [[Mellismo]] seemed alike: both favored parking dynastical issues and forging a grand, Traditionalism-centred Right-wing alliance. However, scholars differ when discussing mutual position of the two concepts. Some name Minguijón a key protagonist of "sector promellista", highlighting their shared penchant for a conservative bloc;&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; others note rather that Minguijón followed de Mella by firmly incorporating the social dimension into the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Some students, however, suggest that Minguijón opposed "catastrofismo mellista" by working towards a constructive solution.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; They highlight that Minguijón seemed inclined towards politics within the [[Alfonsism|Alfonsist]] framework,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. when courted by [[Angel Ossorio y Gallardo]] in 1914&lt;/ref&gt; while de Mella adopted a decisively anti-system stance with no dynastical commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; One more difference was that unlike a fiercely Germanophile de Mella, during the [[First World War|Great War]] Minguijón adopted a pro-[[Entente Cordiale|Entente]] stand and even considered setting up a pro-French daily.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 127-8&lt;/ref&gt;

When the crisis climaxed in 1919 and the Mellistas broke away to build their own grouping, Minguijón maintained loyalty to Don Jaime. According to some sources he remained influential enough to enforce – together with [[Francisco Martín Melgar y Rodríguez|Francisco Melgar]] - resignation of [[Pascual Comín y Moya]] from the temporary Carlist leadership. However, his days in the movement were already numbered. Together with a group of socially-minded Zaragoza scholars he had been co-operating with for more than a decade, especially Severino Aznar and [[Inocencio Jiménez]],&lt;ref&gt;though periodically also with Maximiliano Arboleya, José Calvo Sotelo or Reig Genovés&lt;/ref&gt; in 1919 he co-founded Grupo de Democracía Cristiana, an organization under the auspices of [[Victoriano Guisasola y Menéndez|cardinal Guiasola]].&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Riquelme 2008, pp. 218-9, Orella Martínez 2012, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Though technically it did not constitute a breach of loyalty towards the Carlist king, Minguijón concluded that Carlism was no longer offering a viable solution. He confirmed his commitment to Traditionalist values, but in terms of political strategy he perceived Carlism a dead-end street: Don Jaime was deprived of descendants and acting as a party leader rather than as a king,&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; while the movement trapped in dynastical intransigence was deprived of any allies.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 202-3&lt;/ref&gt; Determined to seek broad partnership on minimalist basis, Minguijón left Jaimismo in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 279, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ULL.98.43.11.23.jpg|thumb|160px|[[:es:Severino Aznar|Severino Aznar]]]]
In 1922 Minguijón co-issued&lt;ref&gt;with Inocencio Jimenez and conde de Valldellano, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; a manifesto launching [[:es:Partido Social Popular|Partido Social Popular]];&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 232-2&lt;/ref&gt; he was among the Zaragoza socially-minded theorists,&lt;ref&gt;dubbed "grupo coordinador de Zaragoza", including also Inocencio Jimenez and Genaro Poza, Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 221, Alares López 2013, p. 20. On catolicismo social in Aragón, see Eloy Fernández Clemente, Carlos Forcadell, ''Los orígenes del catolicismo social (1890-1910)'', [in:] ''Aragón Contemporáneo. Estudios'', Zaragoza 1986, pp. 79-188, José Estarán Molinero, ''Catolicismo social en Aragón (1878-1901)'', Zaragoza 2001, his also ''Cien años de «Acción Social Católica de Zaragoza» (1903-2003)'', Zaragoza 2003&lt;/ref&gt; one of six streams which merged in the new organization.&lt;ref&gt;formed also by tradicionalismo mellista, izquierda maurista, ACNDP and the Catholics; Fernández Riquelme 2008, pp. 220-1&lt;/ref&gt; The party, inspired by social encylicae of [[Leo XIII]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 2008, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the first Spanish incarnation of Christian Democracy; Minguijón co-authored its ''Programa mínimo'' and enthusiastically advocated its broad platform as allegedly deprived of sectarian particularism;&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 233-4&lt;/ref&gt; the party focus was on social issues tackled within a broad Catholic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;the Carlist political leader, marqués de Villores, issued a warning preventing the Carlists from assisting PSP; the party was referred to as recurrence of Pidalismo, Canal 2000, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; In PSP Minguijón remained one of key theorists, though the party was by no means short of them, having in its ranks also Severino Aznar, Inocencio Jiménez, [[:es:Rafael Aizpún|Rafael Aizpún]], [[José Ibáñez Martín]], [[José María Gil-Robles]], Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo and [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Víctor Pradera]]. The organization, intended as agglutinatory force beyond a future broad right-wing platform, proved to have been just en episode; like all other political parties it was dissolved by the [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dictatorship==
[[File:ULL.75.46.83.11.jpg|thumb|left|[[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo]] with the Aragon [[:es:Somatén|Somatén]]]]
Shortly after the [[March on Rome]] Minguijón defined [[Fascism]] as a sane response to social disunity and administrative chaos, the problems haunting Spain as well; though he refrained from endorsing violence and dictatorship, Minguijón noted that also in his country "tenemos necesidad de depuración y de disciplina".&lt;ref&gt;''El Día de Palencia'' 02.06.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2202833&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the advent of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship two months later he greeted the developments with cautious optimism;&lt;ref&gt;''El Debate'' 26.09.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2285202&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of 1923 the pesepistas voiced their support for renewal and "reconstitución" of political setting. Underlining no support for violence, they hoped for increased social work, making vague references to agrarian reform, syndical liberties, cheap credit, municipal self-government and advanced labor legislation.&lt;ref&gt;''El Debate'' 29.12.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2285445&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many former PSP members, most notably Víctor Pradera, emerged as key theorists behind the primoderiverista regime; however, Minguijón was not visible in the front row of its supporters. He focused mostly on quasi-political work adhering to the Christian-Democratic format, at that time championed mostly by Asociación Católica Nacional de Propagandistas. In 1923-1926 he engaged in Círculo de Estudios, a think-tank born out of ACNDP,&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; giving lectures on social and political issues as well as publishing articles in specialized reviews. Many of them focused on his favorite topic, the question of property, advancing a thesis that increasing ownership among wide social strata was the best strategy for confronting both poverty and revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 he engaged in building [[:es:Organización Corporativa Nacional|Organización Corporativa Nacional]], the nationwide labor organization, by scholars counted among representatives of "tradicionalismo mellista".&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s Minguijón was active discussing structure and composition of the new state diet. Acknowledging that the freshly formed [[:es:Asamblea Nacional Consultiva|Asamblea Consultiva]] was merely a stepping stone towards the ultimate Asamblea Nacional, he fully agreed with its corporative format, in line with the theory of organic democracy. Engaging in polemics with other theorists like Ossorio y Gallardo he rather discussed components of the parliament, advocating slightly larger granularity of its structure.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano García Canales, ''La teoría de la representación en la España del siglo XX: (de la crisis de la restauración a 1936)'', Madrid 1977, {{ISBN|9788460010531}}, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Himself he did not emerge as major [[Patriotic Union (Spain)|Unión Patriótica]] official&lt;ref&gt;it is known only that he closely co-operated with UP, Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; and was not appointed to the quasi-parliament; it is not clear whether, except relations with Pradera, he had access to Primo or any of key decision-makers of the regime. Tone of Minguijón's editorials, though never enthusiastic, cooled down over time; those from the late 1920s and 1930 are increasingly escapist. They discuss foreign policy, history, ideas, law, great personalities etc., but tend to evade current issues. They remain firm, however, in support of Catholic trade unions&lt;ref&gt;''Boletín de Acción Social'' December 1928, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=9&amp;path=1000167175&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and Catholic social thought,&lt;ref&gt;''La Tierra'' 15.08.29, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=9&amp;path=5015738&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in opposition to violence.&lt;ref&gt;also from the right; for Minguijón's anxiety related to violence of Legionarios de Albiñana see ''La Voz'' 04.12.30, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=9&amp;path=2008513&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republic==
[[File:ULL.98.23.1.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Minguijon in press cartoon, [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] years]]
Upon the advent of the Second Spanish Republic Minguijón did not join any political party and adopted a position of an observer. In the spring of 1931 his press commentaries maintained an abstract, [[Aesopian language]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. on May 7, 1931, in one of his very first commentaries after the fall of the monarchy, Minguijón discussed a manifesto of Liga de Unión Latina in Paris, see ''Las Provincias'' 07.05.31, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=15&amp;path=1000319212&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the months and years to come Minguijón assumed a more specific stance; though he declared himself a monarchist (with increasingly Alfonsist penchant),&lt;ref&gt;''Labor'' 29.08.35, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3028826&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time he advocated constructive work under the republican regime.&lt;ref&gt;''Labor'' 07.03.35, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3028748&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; His focus was invariably on social issues and the question of property.&lt;ref&gt;he compared agrarian reform to building a railway line across private property: you have to sacrifice individual good for common good; ''Labor'' 15.04.35, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3028761&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Lambasting elitism&lt;ref&gt;"¿Es que la nobleza existía verdaderamente entre nosotros ? ¿Es que desempeñaba una verdadera función social de dirección, de guía, de patronato?

Though in favor of common spirit, Minguijón opposed dictatorship of the majority&lt;ref&gt;''El Día de Palencia'' 11.03.32, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2199714&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledged the anti-democratic tide overwhelming Europe as a "crisis of liberty"; he compared [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist]], [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] regimes using the word "totalitario", though he also distinguished between them.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 22.10.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/10/22/046.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Denying Fascist identity, he admitted superiority of the Italian system – respectful to religious and secular tradition – compared to the Soviet one,&lt;ref&gt;''El Día de Palencia'' 31.01.36, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2199362&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; praising also [[Piłsudski]] for [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|stopping bolshevism in 1920]] and [[Hitler]] for preventing a Bolshevik revolution in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''La Cruz'' 30.11.35, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=3053578&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Minguijón denounced the Spanish revolutionary&lt;ref&gt;he denounced every revolution as chaotic bloodbath, ''Labor'' 20.06.35, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3028791&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Left as inventing a Fascist menace but offering the same totalitarian solution;&lt;ref&gt;''La Gaceta de Tenerife'' 01.08.35, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=8&amp;path=5048913&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; his own preference was for the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Salazar]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;"a nuestro lado tenemos una nación que ha salido de la anarquía y que lentamente se va reconstituyendo. Esta nacion no tiene un Mussolini, tiene un Oliveira Salazar", ''Correo de Tortosa'' 05.07.34&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Minguijón co-founded a Zaragoza-based Centro de Estudios Sociales, born out of ACNDP and formatted as an Aragon version of the Madrid-based Instituto Social Obrero;&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt; he published in periodicals issued by both think-tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; He remained active in Christian-Democratic realm, taking part in various international congresses.&lt;ref&gt;''Universalità e cultura nel pensiero di Luigi Sturzo'', Roma 2001, {{ISBN|9788849800937}}, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; Politically he drew closer to CEDA;&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; it was thanks to its votes, combined with support from other Right-wing groupings, that in October 1933 Minguijón was elected – according to some authors as "tradicionalista"&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Villa García, ''Las elecciones de 1933 en el País Vasco y Navarra'', Madrid 2007, {{ISBN|9788498491159}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; – to Tribunal de Garantías Constitucionales,&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; a 35-member body acting as the Republic's constitutional court.

Gaining seat in Tribunal suspended Minguijón's university career, enforced his transfer from Zaragoza to Madrid and reduced his activity as a press pundit, though he continued sending commentaries to various periodicals. As constitutional judge Minguijón found himself in an awkward position; the body was entrusted with safeguarding the juridical republican system, while at the same time he was growing increasingly disillusioned with legal order of the Republic. His struggle was reflected in a highly contested vote on the [[:ca:Llei de Contractes de Conreu|Catalan Leases Act]], known as Llei de Contractes de Conreu. The verdict was possibly the key pronouncement of the Tribunal durcing Minguijón's tenure and pertained to two issues: [[:es:Estatuto de autonomía de Cataluña de 1932|Catalan autonomy]] and the social question, the latter related to vineyard tenants’ status. The Tribunal, at that time dominated by conservatively minded judges, decided against the claims of the Catalans and the tenants; Minguijón did not share that opinion and recorded a votum separatum.&lt;ref&gt;Joaquim de Camps i Arboix, ''El parlament de Catalunya, (1932-1936)'', Barcelona 1976, {{ISBN|9788429711523}}, p. 146, Cristóbal Robles, Cristóbal Robles Muñoz, ''José María de Urquijo e Ybarra: opinión, religión y poder'', Madrid 1997, {{ISBN|9788400076689}}, p 577; for Minguijón's view as justified to the public see ''La Gaceta de Tenerife'' 22.07.34, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=5049024&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
The [[Spanish coup of July 1936|July 1936 coup]] caught Minguijón during a summer break in Zaragoza. The city was almost immediately captured by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] and most University professors did not hesitate to voice their enthusiastic support for the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Angel Alcaide Fernández, ''El apoyo de la Universidad de Zaragoza a la sublevación militar de 1936'', [in:] Ignacio Peiró Martín, Guillermo Vicente y Guerrero (eds.), ''Estudios históricos sobre la Universidad de Zaragoza'', Zaragoza 2010, {{ISBN|9788499110479}}, pp. 339-351; he is neither mentioned in Angela Cenarro, ''La Reina de Hispanidad: fascismo y nacionalcatolicismo en Zaragoza. 1939-1945'', [in:] ''Revista de Historia Jerónimo Zurita'' 72 (1997), pp. 91-102&lt;/ref&gt; Minguijón is not listed either among most active advocates of the cause or among those engineering purges at the University,&lt;ref&gt;Alcaide Fernández 2010, pp. 342-3&lt;/ref&gt; though at some point he declared his backing.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Pulpillo Leiva, ''Orígenes del franquismo: la construcción de la "Nueva España" (1936-1941)'' [PhD thesis Universidad Rey Juan Carlos], Madrid 2013, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In September he formally resigned from the anyway defunct Tribunal and resumed teaching at his usual History of Law chair in University of Zaragoza, the role performed for 2 years until in November 1938 he was nominated to a newly established Nationalist high court, Tribunal Supremo.&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014. The Tribunal first convened in May 1939 in Madrid, Carlos Jiménez Villarejo, ''La destrucción del orden republicano (apuntes juridicos)'', [in:] ''Hispania Nova'' 7 (2007), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Having abandoned Aragón – this time for good – he resumed his highest judge role and formally contributed to forging of the [[Francoism|Francoist system]]; until 1950 the Tribunal consisted of appointees deemed utterly loyal and entrusted with juridical institutionalization of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco J. Bastida Freijedo, ''El pensamiento político del Tribunal Supremo en la Dictadura franquista'', [in:] ''Cronica Popular'' 20.11.14, available [http://www.cronicapopular.es/2014/11/el-pensamiento-politico-del-tribunal-supremo-en-la-dictadura-franquista/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a contemporary scholar, during the Civil War Minguijón was also vital to forging of the emerging Nationalist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; His part was about contributions to ''Noticiero de España'', a Burgos-based bulletin issued by Servicios de Prensa y Propaganda and created to disseminate official ideas of the emerging state;&lt;ref&gt;Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; within its editorial board he formed a group dubbed "juristas",&lt;ref&gt;Pulpillo Leiva 2013, pp. 84-5&lt;/ref&gt; considered also representative of "Traditionalists and Church".&lt;ref&gt;Pulpillo Leiva 2013, pp. 719-720&lt;/ref&gt; There were 63 issues of ''Noticiero'' published during its most prolific phase; there are 9 Minguijón's articles identified, published between May 1938 and August 1939.&lt;ref&gt;there are 9 Minguijón's articles identified, published on 28.5.38, 5.8.38, 3.9.38, 17.9.38, 18.2.39, 25.3.39, 29.4.39, 1.7.39, 12.8.39, see Pulpillo Leiva 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Logotipo de Noticiero de Espana.jpg|thumb|logotype of ''Noticiero de España'']]
Minguijón's role in ''Noticiero'' is described as related mostly to delegitimization of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;along with Melchor Fernandez Almagro. Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Its regime was portrayed as climax of bolshevization which commenced in [[Bolshevik Revolution|Russia in 1917]] but manifested itself in Spain in [[:es:Sublevación de Jaca|Jaca in 1930]], in [[Asturian Uprising of 1934|Asturias in 1934]] and following the victory of [[Spanish general election, 1936|Frente Popular in 1936]];&lt;ref&gt;Pulpillo Leiva 2013, pp. 161-2, 170&lt;/ref&gt; Minguijón argued that the Republican regime abandoned its own rules,&lt;ref&gt;Pulpillo Leiva 2013, pp. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; decomposed into anarchy&lt;ref&gt;Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 205; "el Movimiento nacionalista no se alzó contra un régimen, sino contra la ausencia de régimen, no contra un Gobierno, sino contra la una carencia de Gobierno, no contra una legalidad, sino contra una anarquía", quoted after Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; and lost legitimacy;&lt;ref&gt;thesis laid out in ''La cuestión española. Legalidad Republicana'' of February 18, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, it turned against democratic principles and rising of genuine Spain was necessary,&lt;ref&gt;''El alzamiento era inevitable'', referred after Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; also to restore them.&lt;ref&gt;Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote about the Republic with bitterness and visible disappointment, lamenting that the regime was trapped in contradictions: it failed to eradicate domination of the privileged classes and to introduce reforms based on the will of the people.&lt;ref&gt;"Una República que se instaura por voluntad del pueblo; unas clases privilegiadas que no se resignan a perder sus privilegios; la República liberal, progresiva, democrática que quiere libertar al pueblo oprimido; los privilegiados que se conjuran contra ella; el Gobierno atacado por los rebeldes; las oligarquías contra la democracia; la fuerza contra el derecho, etc. etc.", quoted after Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; All these hopes were now laid in the emerging Nationalist state.&lt;ref&gt;"No hay derecho sino en el Estado y por el Estado. El mundo de la conciencia, los derechos fundamentales de las personas humanas, las afirmaciones del derecho natural, las ideas que se presentan como interiorización de nuestra conciencia de una superrealidad fundamental llamada a dominar las realidades contingentes, todo eso queda suprimido en una concepción tan radicalmente estatista", quoted after Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 826&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier Minguijón's skepticism about Fascism gave way to cautious endorsement; he dubbed earlier comparisons between Fascism and [[Communism]] superficial&lt;ref&gt;see his ''Fascism in Spain'', [in:] J. Bayo, ''Spain'', New York 1939, pp. 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; and in one of his last articles published in ''Noticiero'', dated July 1939, he analyzed where Fascism overlapped with Traditionalism, having found 6 points that both had in common.&lt;ref&gt;"[1] El fascismo es teísta, es decir, respeta y fomenta los va-lores y las instituciones religiosas. [2] Utilizando las palabras de Henri Mazel de la revista Mercure de France del 15 de septiembre de 1935 co-menta que el fascismo respeta la libertad y la dignidad individual, la propiedad y el ahorro, la familia y la patria, la moral y la religión, insertándose en un orden civiliza-cional. [3] Ideología que se representa como reanudadora de las tra-diciones de la antigua Roma para recuperar la gloria del Imperio antiguo [4] Importante culto a la infancia y a la juventud sobre la que ha de insertarse los valores de la tradición histórica [5] Inculca en la población disciplina de acción prosperidad y orden [6] A la larga también inculca la libertad del individuo pero siempre supeditada, en palabras de Mussolini, a la fe, la disciplina y la tenacidad", ''Caracteres del fascismo'', July 1, 1939, quoted [except numbering, inserted for convenience] after Pulpillo Leiva 2013, pp. 731-732&lt;/ref&gt;

==Francoism==

Following the Nationalist capture of Madrid Minguijón settled in the city, where he resumed his academic career at history of law and at sociology in Universidad Central;&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Díaz 1995, p. 530&lt;/ref&gt; his teaching influenced the next generation of Traditionalists like [[Rafael Gambra Ciudad|Rafael Gambra]], who attended Minguijón's lectures and were to gain prominence in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1959, pp. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; None of the sources consulted provides information on Minguijón's role in Tribunal Supremo; the entire body is known mostly for retroactively reversing many components of the Republican legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Jiménez Villarejo 2007, pp. 10, 12, 15, 16, 23&lt;/ref&gt; He did not assume any official posts in state administration; he is neither noted as active in political structures, be it [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|Falangist]] or otherwise. In 1940 he entered the national executive of [[Acción Católica]],&lt;ref&gt;''Boletin Oficial del Obispado de Orihuela'' 16.05.40, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=13&amp;path=4001712&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally giving lectures and publishing in AC periodicals.

Having retired from the Tribunal and the university in 1944&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2014&lt;/ref&gt; he focused on various duties in Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas, Institución Fernando el Católico, Colegio de Aragón, [[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas]] and especially in Instituto Balmes de Sociología, created by CSIC as the brainchild of Severino Aznar.&lt;ref&gt;Jesús Ibanez (ed.), ''Las ciencias sociales en España. Historia inmediata, crítica y perspectivas'', vol. 1: ''Sociología'', Madrid 1992, {{ISBN|9788474914061}}, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his age and health, these activities declined sharply in the early 1950s; his last identified lecture in Real Academia took place in 1951&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 07.11.51, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1951/11/07/020.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and his engagement in Instituto Balmes became loose after 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Alares López 2013, p. 267 and onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

During Francoism Minguijón did not resume his longtime career of a press pundit, limiting himself to scientific and semi-scientific articles in specialized or Catholic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Criterio, see ''ABC'' 15.06.48, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1948/06/15/016.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about his personal views on the developing Francoist system. In the press he was quoted as pursuing his interest in social question and praising social institutions of the Nationalist Spain, especially [[:es:Instituto Nacional de Previsión|Instituto Nacional de Previsión]], for their efficiency, at least compared to the Republican efforts.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 01.10.41, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1941/10/01/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted Traditionalist outlook,&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1959, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; though he is not recorded as active in any Carlist branch of the time.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was recollected as skeptical – also in private - about both democracy and capitalism, deemed anonymous and amorphous forces which should be confronted by "localismo cultural", based on tradition and – inevitably - small property.&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1959, pp. 86-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before death Minguijón was described as a lonely old man, visited by a handful of disciples and few lifelong friends, like Severino Aznar; on the other hand, he remained perfectly lucid, serene, humble, as usual slightly ironic and far from any emphasis. Waking up around mid-day and working late into night, he was busy writing a treaty tailored as popularization of great philosophical concepts; it was supposed to amalgamate them within a new vision, intended for the future.&lt;ref&gt;"vulgarización de las grandes concepciones físicas y filosóficas del presente, tomadas en aquel punto en que coinciden y se completan para darnos una visión nueva del mundo en que vivimos. Una visión que enlaza asimismo la problematice política y social d nuestra época, en sus más profundas raíces", Gambra 1959, pp. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; His death was acknowledged by brief notes in some national newspapers; Colegio de Aragón organized a memorial homage session shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Alares López 2013, p. 382-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:ULL.87.54.39.31.jpg|thumb|left|Minguijón Street, Zaragoza]]
As a conservative theorist who strove to stimulate organization of the working class Minguijón failed; he is not noted as influencing Carlist syndicates either in their Catholic or [[pistolerismo (type or urban violence in Spain)|pistolerismo]] format.&lt;ref&gt;Minguijón is not a single time mentioned in works dealing with Catholic and Carlist syndicalism as developing in the early 20th century, compare Colin M. Winston, ''Carlist workers groups in Catalonia, 1900-1923'', [in:] Stanley G. Payne. (ed.), ''Identidad y nacionalismo en la España contemporánea: el carlismo, 1833-1975'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|8487863469}}, pp. 85-101, his also ''The Proletarian Carlist Road to Fascism: Sindicalismo Libre'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 17/1 (1982), pp. 557-585, his also ''Workers and the Right in Spain, 1900-1936'', Princeton 2014, {{ISBN|9781400858095}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, already in the early 1910s Minguijón was noted in wide public discourse as "excelente periodista católico"&lt;ref&gt;''La lectura dominical'' 29.04.11, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001659420&amp;page=12 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or "ilustre publicista católico",&lt;ref&gt;''Revista Montserratina'' December 1917, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0005027605&amp;page=59 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1920s acknowledged also as "conocido sociologo".&lt;ref&gt;''Nuestro Tiempo'' October 1924, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002696758&amp;page=76 here]&lt;/ref&gt; When referred to as a law scholar, apart from the usual "catedrático"&lt;ref&gt;''Revista católica de cuestines sociales'' August 1929, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002737190&amp;page=61 here], also "doctisimo catedrático", "sabio catedrático", "catedrático ilustre" etc&lt;/ref&gt; he was occasionally hailed as "maestro".&lt;ref&gt;''Revista de ciencias jurídicas'' 1926, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0005142279&amp;page=100 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In professional realm he gained name following the 1927 publication of ''Historia del derecho español'', in 1933 entering the elite of jurisprudence scholars when nominated to Tribunal de Garantias and finally acquiring the highest status available to an academic when nominated to Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas in 1940. It remains striking, however, that he was not invited to [[Real Academia de Jurisprudencia y Legislación]].

After Minguijón's death a street in Zaragoza and a college in his native Calatayud were named after him; in both cases the naming survived purges related to anti-Francoist backlash of the late 20th century and implementation of [[Historical Memory Law|Ley de Memoria Histórica]] of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in an article discussing health care infrastructure in Zaragoza Minguijón is referred to as a Christian-Democrat, not a Carlist or a Francoist, see Isabel Delmás Gracia, ''Enfermeria y planificacion familiar en Aragon en el franquismo y transicion'' [MA thesis], Zaragoza 2014, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; None of his works has been re-published and the institutions he co-founded, Instituto Balmes and Colegio de Aragón, ceased to exist as separate units. In public discourse he was gradually falling into oblivion; since 1959 up to date the popular Madrid daily ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' mentioned him 7 times, in all cases briefly noting his name when discussing Christian-Democratic, Traditionalist or social thought;&lt;ref&gt;compare hemeroteca of ''ABC'', available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; a contemporary scholar declared him a "completely forgotten figure".&lt;ref&gt;Manuelle Peloille, ''Notas sobre la recepcion de la recepción de la revolución rusa en España'', p. 4, available [https://www.academia.edu/7028869/NOTAS_SOBRE_LA_RECEPCION_DE_LA_REVOLUCI%C3%93N_RUSA_EN_ESPA%C3%91A here]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently he is acknowledged only in major general encyclopedias, covered in very brief notes as "historiador del derecho", member of the high Tribunal and "periodista".&lt;ref&gt;''Minguijón Adrían, Salvador'' [in:] ''Gran Enciclopedia de España'', vol. 14, Zaragoza 1999, {{ISBN|9788487544149}}, p. 6537&lt;/ref&gt; In specialized almanacs and reference dictionaries he appears as a scholar in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Díaz 1995, pp. 529-531&lt;/ref&gt;

Minguijón has earned no monograph so far. In historical literature he is noted mostly as a political theorist, though exact categorization might differ: he could be referred to as one of the first Christian-Democratic politicians and theorists in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 72, Díaz Díaz 1995, p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; as a somewhat unorthodox Carlist who strove to modernize Traditionalism,&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2002, p. 288, Fernández Riquelme 2008, p. 197; on the other hand, he is ignored in a recent large encyclopedica entry on Traditionalism, Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Tradicionalismo'', [in:] Javier Fernández Sebastián (ed.), ''Diccionario político y social del siglo XX español'', Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788420687698}}, pp. 1163-1173&lt;/ref&gt; as a representative of corporativismo católico, democracia orgánica and católicismo social,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamín Oltra, Amando de Miguel, ''Bonpartismo y catolicismo. Una hipótesis sobre los orígenes ideológicos del franquismo'', [in:] ''Revista de Sociologia'' 8 (1978), p. 87, Sergio Fernández Riquelme, ''La Democracia Orgánica en Espańa [1943-1967]: los teóricos y las ideas'', [in:] ''Arbil'' 120, available [http://www.arbil.org/120demo.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; or as in the very recent work, as key contributor to theoretical vision of the emerging Francoism.&lt;ref&gt;Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 19; in the text he is noted 26 times&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors straightforwardly declare Minguijón an enemy of democracy,&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Díaz 1995, p. 531&lt;/ref&gt; some prefer qualified applications like "democristiano"&lt;ref&gt;Baltar Rodriguez 2013, p. 72, ''Minguijón y Adrián, Juan Salvador'' [in:] ''Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa'' online, available [http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=8834 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and some quote him speaking passionately against "democracia individualista y caótica",&lt;ref&gt;Oltra, de Miguel 1978, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; while declaring that only a [[Corporatism|corporative system]] ensured genuine democracy.&lt;ref&gt;contributing to the Francoist periodical in midst of the Civil War (September 1938) he wrote that the Republic was "un régimen basado en la voluntad del pueblo. Y en buen régimen democrático la voluntad del pueblo habrá de ser respetada siempre, lo mismo cuando nos agrade que cuando no nos agrade. Esa es la democracia. Nosotros no conocemos otra"; the problem was that the Frentepopulistas did not respect democracy, referred after Pulpillo Leiva 2013, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Few authors recognize him as one of sociology pioneers in Spain, the follower of [[Jaime Balmes]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, pp. 16, 64, also Oltra, de Miguel 1978, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name in the case of '''Salamba Sarvāngāsana''' (Supported Shoulderstand) comes from the Sanskrit words ''Salamba''  meaning "supported", ''Sarva''  meaning "all" or "every", ''Anga'' meaning "limb" or "bodypart",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/asana-vinyasa-series/the-finishing-sequence/item/salamba-sarvangasana/ | title = Salamba Sarvangāsana - AshtangaYoga.info | accessdate = 11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Āsana''  meaning "posture"," position", or "seat",&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinha|first=S.C.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=1 June 1996|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus Salamba Sarvāngasana literally translates to "supported-all-limbs-pose".

He wrote on philosophy, religion, and astronomy, the latter including a commentary on [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|al-Tusi]] and critiques of [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi|al-Shirazi]].

== Astronomy ==

In his commentary on al-Tusi Khafri contributes some original solutions to the [[equant]] problem, three for Mercury and one for the Moon.  His solution for the Moon, like Ptolemy's original model, still contains the discrepancy for the Moon's distance that was fixed earlier by [[Ibn al-Shatir|al-Shatir]], of whose work he was apparently not aware.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4831">'''Sigríður Þorgeirsdóttir''' (born 1958 in [[Iceland]]) is professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Iceland]]. In 1997 she was the first woman to become a member of the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Iceland. Prior to that she lectured in philosophy at [[Rostock University]]. She was Jane and Aatos Erkko professor at [[Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies]] 2014-2015, [[University of Helsinki.]]

== Education ==
Sigríður graduated from [[University of Boston|Boston University]] in 1981. She pursued graduate studies in Boston and at [[Freie Universität Berlin]] where she finished her master's degree in 1988. In 1993 she completed her doctoral studies at the [[Humboldt-Universität Berlin|Humboldt-Universität]] in Berlin.

== Philosophy ==
Sigríður specializes in the [[Friedrich Nietzsche|philosophy of Nietzsche]], [[feminist philosophy]] and philosophy of nature and embodiment. She has interpreted Nietzsche's philosophy of the body and sexual difference in terms of its influence on feminist and women thinkers of the 20th century, from [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] to [[Luce Irigaray]] and [[Judith Butler]]. She has published works on feminist philosophy, the philosophy of Arendt and Beuvoir, and recently introductory texts to women in the history of philosophy. In her writings on philosophy of embodiment and nature, the notions of relationality and connectedness are central. This also influences her recent work on economy and morals, such as in studies on the debt-economy.

== Administrative work ==
Sigríður is one of the founders of the [[United Nations University GEST—Gender Equality Studies and Training Programme]], a joint project of the United Nations University, University of Iceland and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. She serves on the Academic Advisory Board of the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies. She is on the board of [[FISP]], the world organisation of philosophical societies that organizes the World Congress of Philosophy, and chair of its committee for gender issues. The Department of Philosophy at the University of Iceland hosts the [[Erasmus Summer Schools in Gender and Philosophy]] that Sigríður runs with colleagues from the universities of Jyväskylä in Finland, Oslo in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark.

The order was founded in [[San Fior]] in [[Treviso]] Italy in 1930 by Blessed [[Maria Pia Mastena]] (1881-1951). It was initially approved by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vittorio Veneto|Bishop of Vittorio Veneto]] on December 8, 1936 and the approval of the [[Congregation of Pontifical Right]] on 10 December 1947.&lt;ref name=BiogPia/&gt;

The order has 22 houses, including some in Brazil and Indonesia.

'''''Suizen''''' (吹禅) (“blowing Zen”) is a [[Zen]] practice consisting of playing the traditional Japanese [[shakuhachi]] [[bamboo]] [[flute]] as a means of attaining self-realization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Annals of the International Shakuhachi Society'', Volume 1. Ed. Dan E Mayers [n.d., c. 1996?]: Christopher Blasdel, “The Shakuhachi: Aesthetics of a single tone,” p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Suizen was traditionally practised by the [[Komusō]] (“monks of emptiness”), the Zen Buddhist monks of the [[Fuke-shū|Fuke]] sect of Japan who flourished during the [[Edo period]] (1600 to 1868).

Instrumental music is rare in all Buddhist practice where instruments usually accompany ritual chants if they are used at all. With ''suizen'', the playing of the shakuhachi as a spiritual exercise is at the core of the religious practice, making it unique in the world of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of the International Shakuhachi Society'', Volume 1. Ed. Dan E Mayers [n.d., 1996?]: Andreas B Gutzwiller, “The Japanese flute Shakuhachi and its music: it is foreign or just strange?,” p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gutzwiller, Andreas, ''Die Shakuhachi der Kinko-Schule. Studien zur traditionallen Musik Japans''. Vol. 5, 2nd Edn., Florian Noetzel Verlag, Heinrichshofen-Bücher, Wilhelmshaven 2005. Pp. 20-22. {{ISBN|3-7959-0845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of ''suizen'' may be understood in the context of both ancient Buddhist and Chinese classics which exerted a profound influence on Japanese music, which used awareness of sound as a medium of enlightenment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Breath is also of fundamental significance as the standard practice of sitting Zen meditation (''[[zazen]]'') and so there is a natural link between ''zazen'' and ''suizen''. The type of breathing technique required varies from school to school within ''suizen''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of the International Shakuhachi Society'', Volume 1. Ed. Dan E Mayers [n.d., 1996?]: Ralph Samuelson, “Toward an understanding of Shakuhachi Honkyoku,” p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''ichi on jo butsu'' – the attainment of enlightenment through a single note – became an important aspect of the ''Fuke'' sect’s ‘blowing Zen’ as it developed in later periods.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of the International Shakuhachi Society'', Volume 1. Ed. Dan E Mayers [n.d., 1996?]: Christopher Blasdel, “The Shakuhachi: Aesthetics of a single tone,” p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The sound produced by the instrument, which was taught along strict and traditional lines in the ''suizen'' schools, is not considered important. It is the practice of blowing which leads to enlightenment.

In 1823 Hisamatsu Fūyō (Hisamatsu Masagoro Suga no Sandaharu – c. 1790s to c. 1880s) published his short treatise on ''suizen'' practice, Hitori Mondō (“self-questioning”).&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of the International Shakuhachi Society'', Volume 1. Ed. Dan E Mayers [n.d., 1996?]: Robin Hartshorne and Kazuaki Tanahashi, “The hitori mondo of Hisamatsu Fuyo,”pp. 41-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in full in Gutzwiller 2005 (see footnote 3, above), pp. 175-188 (German and Japanese text), with a comprehensive analysis on pp. 149-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Hisamatsu Fūyō speaks of “going all the way with intellect and then going beyond intellect” on the path to enlightenment. He distinguishes the form (''jitsu'') of shakuhachi music played for entertainment from the emptiness (''kyo'') of Zen instrumental practice.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of the International Shakuhachi Society'', Volume 1. Ed. Dan E Mayers [n.d., 1996?]: Robin Hartshorne and Kazuaki Tanahashi, “The hitori mondo of Hisamatsu Fuyo,”p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shakuhachi repertoire derives from the Fuke original solo pieces, the ''[[Honkyoku]].'' For suizen practitioners these are traditionally played in the manner of a personal spiritual practice and not as a public performance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of the International Shakuhachi Society'', Volume 1. Ed. Dan E Mayers [n.d., 1996?]: Ralph Samuelson, “Toward an understanding of Shakuhachi Honkyoku,” p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditions of Fuke Zen and ''suizen'' continue today both in Japan and around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5958">The '''tax on childlessness''' ({{lang-ru|налог на бездетность|translit=nalog na bezdetnost}}) was imposed in the [[Soviet Union]] and other Communist countries, starting in the 1940s, as part of their [[Natalism|natalist]] policies. [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime created the tax in order to encourage adult people to reproduce, thus increasing the number of people and the [[Soviet Union#Population and society|population of the Soviet Union]]. The 6% income tax affected men from the age of 25 to 50, and [[Wife|married women]] from 20 to 45 years of age.&lt;ref name = "russian_tax"&gt;"Tax on childlessness, which existed in the Soviet Union, proposed to be restored" ("Налог на бездетность, существовавший в СССР, предлагают восстановить") http://www.finiz.ru/cfin/tmpl-art/id_art-1054929 (accessed January 3, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax remained in place until the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], though by the end of the [[Soviet Union]], the amount of money which could be taxed was steadily reduced. Minister of Health [[Mikhail Zurabov]] and Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee for Health Protection [[Nikolai Gerasimenko]] proposed reinstating the tax in [[Russia]] in 2006, but so far it has not been reinstated.&lt;ref name = "pravda"&gt;"Childless Russian families to pay taxes for their social inaction," http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/15-09-2006/84467-childless-0 (accessed January 3, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Russia==
As originally passed and enforced from 1941 to 1990, the tax affected most childless men from 25 to 50 years of age, and most childless married women from 20 to 45 years of age. The tax was 6% of the childless person's wages, but it provided certain exceptions: those with children that died during [[World War II]] did not have to pay the tax, nor did war heroes that received certain awards. Also, many students were able to obtain an exemption from the tax, as did people who earned less than 70 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] a month. Furthermore, those who were medically incapable to give birth were also exempt to this tax, and many single men fraudulently escaped the tax by claiming infertility and provided fake medical documentation.&lt;ref name = "russian_tax" /&gt;

After 1990, the income exemption was increased to 150 rubles, meaning that the first 150 rubles of income for childless adults went untaxed.&lt;ref name = "table"&gt;"On the phasing out of the tax on single men and small families of Soviet citizens" (О ПОЭТАПНОЙ ОТМЕНЕ НАЛОГА НА ХОЛОСТЯКОВ, ОДИНОКИХ И МАЛОСЕМЕЙНЫХ ГРАЖДАН СССР) http://www.businesspravo.ru/Docum/DocumShow_DocumID_37788.html (accessed January 3, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the tax was changed to no longer apply to women, and in 1992, it was rendered irrelevant and inactive due to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

==Poland==
In 1946, communist Poland introduced a similar increase of the basic income tax rate, in effect a tax on childlessness, popularly called ''[[:pl:Bykowe|bykowe]]'' in Polish ("bull's tax", the "bull" being a metonymy for an unmarried man). First, childless and unmarried people over 21 years of age were affected (from 1 January 1946 till 29 November 1956), then only over 25 years of age (30 November 1956 till 1 January 1973).&lt;ref&gt;Art. 20 Personal Income Tax Decree of 26 Oct 1950, Dz.U. No. 7 of 1957 r., Item 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romania==
{{See|Decree 770}}
Taxes on childlessness were part of the natalist policy introduced by [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in [[Communist Romania]] in the period 1967-1990. Along with the outlawing of abortion and contraception  (1967) and  mandatory gynecological revisions, these taxes were introduced in various forms in 1977 and 1986. Unmarried citizens had to pay penalty for childlessness, the tax income rate being increased by 8-10% for them.&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;Kligman, Gail.

==Effects and Proposals==
During the Soviet Union, Russia had a higher fertility rate than it did in the years after the fall of the Soviet Union, prompting some Russian leaders to propose bringing back the tax on childlessness.&lt;ref name = "pravda" /&gt; According to the Health Ministry, the total fertility rate dropped from 2.19 children/woman to 1.17 children/woman in the aftermath of the Soviet Union. According to the Russian Director of the Center for Demography [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], this birth rate is among the lowest in the world, and Russian leaders have described the demographic issues in Russia as being symptomatic of a "crisis."

While the tax on childlessness has not been re-enacted, other proposals have been. For example, [[Vladimir Putin]] enacted a proposal to provide cash incentives for women who are willing to have a second child.&lt;ref name = "putin"&gt;"A second baby? Russia's mothers aren't persuaded." http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0519/p01s04-woeu.html (accessed January 3, 2009.)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Logic of Modern Physics''''' is a 1927 [[philosophy of science]] book by American physicist and Nobel laureate [[Percy Williams Bridgman]]. The book was widely read by scholars in the [[social sciences]], in which it had a huge influence in the 1930s and 1940s,&lt;ref name="Crowther-Heyck2005p65"/&gt; and its major influence on the field of psychology in particular surpassed even that on methodology in physics, for which it was originally intended.&lt;ref name="Green1992myth"/&gt; The book is notable for explicitly identifying, analyzing, and explaining [[operationalism]] for the first time,&lt;ref name="Sarkar2005p76"&gt;Sarkar, Sahotra and Pfeifer, Jessica (2005) ''The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA76 p. 76]&lt;/ref&gt; and coining the term [[operational definition]].

Operationalism can be considered a variation on the [[positivist]] theme, and, arguably, a very powerful and influential one.&lt;ref name="Crowther-Heyck2005p65"&gt;Crowther-Heyck, Hunter (2005) ''Herbert A. Simon: The Bounds of Reason in Modern America'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=LV1rnS9NBjkC&amp;pg=PA65 p. 65]&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Arthur Eddington]]&lt;ref&gt;Eddington, A. (1920). ''[[s:Space Time and Gravitation]]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; had discussed notions similar to operationalization before Bridgman, and [[American Pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosophers&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce, C.S.]] (1955). How to make our ideas clear. In J. Buchler (Ed.), Philosophical writings of Peirce (pp. 23–41). New York: Dover. (Original work published 1878.)&lt;/ref&gt; had also advanced solutions to the related ontological problems. Bridgman's formulation, however, became the most influential.&lt;ref name="Green1992myth"/&gt;

==Influence==
In the social sciences, the main influence has been in psychology. The influence on psychology has been even greater than that on methodology in physics, for which it was originally intended.&lt;ref name="Green1992myth"&gt;Green, Christopher D. (1992) ''[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/199/1/operat.htm Of Immortal Mythological Beasts: Operationism in Psychology]'' in ''Theory &amp; Psychology'', 2, pp. 291–320&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the influence on psychology in the 1930s and 1940s include [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] (''The Operational Basis of Psychology'' and ''The Operational Definition of Psychological Concepts''), and [[Clark L. Hull]] (''The Principles of Behavior: An Introduction to Behavior Theory'').&lt;ref name="Crowther-Heyck2005p352"&gt;Crowther-Heyck (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LV1rnS9NBjkC&amp;pg=PA352 p. 352] note 18&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been the central influence of the official [[epistemology]] governing psychological method for the whole century."&lt;ref name="Koch1992p275"&gt;Koch, Sigmund (1992) ''Psychology's Bridgman vs. Bridgman's Bridgman: An Essay in Reconstruction.'', in ''[[Theory and Psychology]]'' vol. 2 no. 3  (1992) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; It was a major influence on [[behaviorism]].

'''Vipassanā''' ([[Pāli]]) or '''vipaśyanā''' ({{lang-sa|विपश्यन}}), "insight," in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition is [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|insight]] into the true nature of reality, defined as ''[[dukkha]]'' (suffering or unsatisfactoriness), ''[[anatta]]'' (non-self), and ''[[anicca]]'' (impermanence), the [[three marks of existence]] in the Theravada tradition,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=889}}{{sfn|Gunaratana|2011|p=21}} and as ''[[sunyata]]'' and ''[[Buddha-nature]]'' in the Mahayana traditions. 

Meditation practice was ended in the Theravada tradition the 10th century, but was re-introduced in Myanmar (Burma) the 18th century,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=889-890}} based on contemporary readings of the ''Satipatthana-sutta'', the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', and other texts. A new tradition developed in the 19th and 20th century, centering on bare insight in conjunction with ''[[samatha]]''.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=890}}&lt;ref&gt;David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Theravada reinvents meditation'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; It became of central importance in the 20th century [[Vipassana movement]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} as developed by [[Ledi Sayadaw]] and [[Mogok Sayadaw]] and popularised by [[Mahasi Sayadaw]], V. R. Dhiravamsa, and [[S. N. Goenka]].{{sfn|King|1992|p=132–137}}{{sfn|Nyanaponika|1998|p=107–109}}{{sfn|Koster|2009|p=9–10}}

In modern [[Theravada]], the combination or disjunction of ''vipassana'' and ''samatha'' is a matter of dispute. While the Pali sutras hardly mention ''vipassana'', describing it as a mental quality alongside with ''samatha'' which develop in tandem and lead to liberation, the Abhidhamma and the commentaries describe ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' as two separate meditation techniques. The Vipassana-movement favoures ''vipassana'' over ''samatha'', but critics point out that both are necessary elements of the Buddhist training.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Enlightenment in Buddhism|Sotāpanna|Jnana|Wisdom in Buddhism{{!}}Prajna|Bodhi|Vidhya|Kensho}}
''Vipassanā'' is a [[Pāli|Pali]] word from the Sanskrit prefix "vi-" and verbal root paś. It is often translated as ''"insight"'' or ''"clear-seeing"'', though the "in-" prefix in "insight" may be misleading; "vi" in [[Indo-Aryan languages]] is equivalent to the Latin "dis." The "vi" in vipassanā may then mean to see into, see through or to see 'in a special way.'{{sfn|Gunaratana|2011|p=21}} Alternatively, the "vi" can function as an intensive, and thus vipassanā may mean "seeing deeply."{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

A synonym for "Vipassanā" is ''paccakkha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|pratyakṣa}}''), "before the eyes," which refers to direct experiential perception. Thus, the type of seeing denoted by "vipassanā" is that of direct perception, as opposed to knowledge derived from reasoning or argument.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In Tibetan, ''vipaśyanā'' is ''lhagthong'' (wylie: ''lhag mthong''). The term "''lhag''" means "higher", "superior", "greater"; the term "''thong''" is "view" or "to see". So together, ''lhagthong'' may be rendered into English as "superior seeing", "great vision" or "supreme wisdom." This may be interpreted as a "superior manner of seeing", and also as "seeing that which is the essential nature." Its nature is a lucidity&amp;mdash;a clarity of mind.&lt;ref name="ray74"&gt;Ray (2004) p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henepola Gunaratana]] defined Vipassanā as:
{{quote|Looking into something with clarity and precision, seeing each component as distinct and separate, and piercing all the way through so as to perceive the most fundamental reality of that thing"{{sfn|Gunaratana|2011|p=21}}}}

==Origins==
According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], in the sutta pitaka the term "vipassanā" is hardly mentioned, while they frequently mention [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]] as the meditative practice to be undertaken.{{sfn|Thanissaro Bhikkhu|n.d.}}{{refn|group=note|Thanissaro Bhikkhu: "If you look directly at the Pali discourses &amp;mdash; the earliest extant sources for our knowledge of the Buddha's teachings &amp;mdash; you'll find that although they do use the word samatha to mean tranquillity, and vipassanā to mean clear-seeing, they otherwise confirm none of the received wisdom about these terms. Only rarely do they make use of the word vipassanā &amp;mdash; a sharp contrast to their frequent use of the word [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]. When they depict the Buddha telling his disciples to go meditate, they never quote him as saying "go do vipassanā," but always "go do jhana." And they never equate the word vipassanā with any mindfulness techniques."{{sfn|Thanissaro Bhikkhu|n.d.}}}} When ''vipassanā'' is mentioned, it is always in tandem with ''[[samatha]]'', as a pair of qualities of mind which are developed.{{sfn|Thanissaro Bhikkhu|n.d.}} According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, "''samatha'', ''jhana'', and ''vipassana'' were all part of a single path."{{sfn|Thanissaro Bhikkhu|n.d.}} {{refn|group=note|Thanissaro Bhikkhu: "This description of the unified role of samatha and vipassana is based upon the Buddha's meditation teachings as presented in the suttas (see "One Tool Among Many" by Thanissaro Bhikkhu). The Abhidhamma and the Commentaries, by contrast, state that samatha and vipassana are two distinct meditation paths (see, for example, The Jhanas in Theravada Buddhist Meditation by H. Gunaratana, ch. 5)."&lt;ref name="What_is"/&gt;}} Norman notes that "the Buddha's way to release [...] was by means of meditative practices."{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'' constituted the original "liberating practice".{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Cousins|1996|p=58}} Vetter further argues that the eightfold path constitutes a body of practices which prepare one, and lead up to, the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}} Vetter and Bronkhorst further note that ''dhyana'' is not limited to single-pointed concentration, which seems to be described in the first ''jhana'', but develops into equanimity and mindfulness,{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=13}}{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} "born from samadhi"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXVI, note 9}} but no longer absorbed in concentration, being mindfully awareness of objects while being indifferent to it,{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107; 140, note 58}} "directing states of meditative absorption towards the mindful awareness of objects."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107}}

Though both terms appear in the [[Sutta Pitaka]]{{refn|group=note|See, for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Out of these debates developed the idea that bare insight suffices to reach [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberation]], by discerning the [[Three marks of existence|Three marks]] (qualities) of (human) existence (''tilakkhana''), namely [[dukkha]] (suffering), [[anatta]] (non-self) and [[anicca]] (impermanence).{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=96-144}}

According to Buswell, by the 10th century ''vipassana'' was  no longer practiced in the Theravada tradition, due to the believe that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of ''Maitreya''.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=889}} It was re-introdcued in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by [[Medawi]] (1728–1816), leading to the rise of the [[Vipassana movement]] in the 20th century, re-inventing ''vipassana''-meditation and developing simplified meditation techniques, based on the ''[[Satipatthana sutta]]'', the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', and other texts, emphasizing ''[[satipatthana]]'' and bare insight.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=890}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=189}}&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Theravada reinvents meditation'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Buddhadasa]] rejected the reliance on the ''Satipatthana sutta'' as being "vague and muddled," instead relying on the ''[[Anapanasati Sutta]]''.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt; According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact.{{sfn|Buddhadasa Bhikkhu|2014|p=79, 101, 117 note 42}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Grzegorz Polak, the four ''upassanā'' (foundations of mindfulness) have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four ''upassanā'' do not refer to four different foundations, but to the awareness of four different aspects of raising mindfulness:{{sfn|Polak|2011}}
* the [[Ayatana|six sense-bases]] which one needs to be aware of (''kāyānupassanā''); 
* contemplation on [[vedanā]]s, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (''vedanānupassanā'');
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittānupassanā);
* the development from the [[five hindrances]]  to the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''dhammānupassanā'').}} Ultimately, these techniques aim at stream entry, with the idea that this first stage of the path to awakening safeguards future development of the person towards full awakening, despite the degenerated age we live in.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=2}}{{refn|group=note|* Fronsdal: "The primary purpose for which Mahasi offered his form of vipassana practice is the attainment of the first of the four traditional Theravada levels of sainthood (that is, stream entry; sotapatti)

The ubiquitous notion of mappo or the "final degenerate age of the dharma" served to reinforce the notion that "enlightenment" was not in fact a viable goal for monks living in inauspicious times."{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=241}}&lt;br&gt;* Robert Sharf: "The initial "taste" of nibbana signals the attainment of sotapatti-the first of four levels of enlightenment-which renders the meditator a "noble person" (ariya-puggala)destined for release from the wheel of existence (samsara)in relatively short order."{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=256}}}}

===Relation with samatha===
{{See also|Samatha|Samadhi (Buddhism)|Dhyāna in Buddhism|Mahamudra|Raja yoga}}

While the [[Abhidhamma]] and the commentaries present ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' as separate paths,{{refn|group=note|Various traditions disagree which techniques belong to which pole.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}}}} in the sutras ''vipassana'' and ''samatha'', combined with ''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]'' (mindfulness), are used together to explore "the fundamental nature of mind and body.&lt;ref name="What_is"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Theravada Buddhism?|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/theravada.html|work=Access to Insight|publisher=Access to Insight|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later Theravada tradition, samatha is regarded as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening concentration in order for insight to arise, which leads to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberation]].

===Vipassanā movement===
{{See also|Vipassana movement|Buddhist modernism}}

The term ''vipassana'' is often conflated with the [[Vipassana movement]], a movement which popularised the new ''vipassana'' teachings and practice. It started in the 1950s in Burma, but has gained wide renown mainly through American Buddhist teachers such as [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], [[Tara Brach]], [[Gil Fronsdal]], [[Sharon Salzberg]], and [[Jack Kornfield]]. The movement has had a wide appeal due to being open and inclusive to different Buddhist and non-buddhist wisdom, poetry as well as science. It has together with the modern American Zen tradition served as one of the main inspirations for the 'mindfulness movement' as developed by [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] and others. The Vipassanā Movement, also known as the Insight Meditation Movement, is rooted in [[Theravada|Theravāda]] Buddhism and the revival of meditation techniques, especially the [[Vipassana movement#The Mahasi ("New Burmese") Method|"New Burmese Method"]] and the [[Thai Forest Tradition]], as well as the modern influences{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} on the traditions of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]], [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]].

In the Vipassanā Movement, the emphasis is on the [[Satipatthana Sutta]] and the use of [[Sati (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] to gain insight into the impermanence of the self. It argues that the development of strong samatha can be disadvantageous,{{sfn|Bond|1992|p=167}} a stance for which the Vipassana Movement has been criticised, especially in Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Bond|1992|p=162-171}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.mcgill.ca/tcpsych/tag/geoffrey-samuel/ Robert H. Sharf, Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University]&lt;/ref&gt; The "New Burmese Method" was developed by [[U Nārada]] (1868–1955), and popularised by [[Mahasi Sayadaw]] (1904-1982) and [[Nyanaponika Thera]] (1901–1994). Other influential Burmese proponents are Ledi Sayadaw and Mogok Sayadaw (who was less known to the West due to lack of International Mogok Centres); [[S. N. Goenka]] was a student of Ledi Sayadaw. Influential Tai teachers are [[Ajahn Chah]] and [[Buddhadasa]]. A well-known Asian female teacher is [[Dipa Ma]].

===Vipassana-meditation===
{{See also|Four stages of enlightenment}}

====Morality, mindfulness of breathing, and reflection====
Vipassanā-meditation uses ''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]'' (mindfulness) and ''[[samatha]]'' (calm), developed through the practice of ''[[anapanasati]]'' (mindfulness of breathing), combined with the contemplation of [[Anicca|impermanence]] as observed in the bodily and mental changes, to gain [[Sampajañña|insight]] into the true nature of this reality.{{sfn|Nyanaponika|1998}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=133}}

Practice begins with the preparatory stage, the practice of ''[[Śīla|sila]]'', morality, giving up wordly thoughts and desires.{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=54-55}}&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, ''Manual of Insight, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Wilson notes that morality is a quintessential element of Buddhist practice, and is also emphasized by the first generation of post-war western teachers. Yet, in the contemporary mindfulness movement, morality as an element of practice has been mostly discarded, 'mystifying' the origins of mindfulness.{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=54-55}}

The practitioner then engages in ''[[anapanasati]]'', mindfulness of breathing, which is described in the [[Satipatthana Sutta]] as going into the forest and sitting beneath a tree and then to simply watch the breath. If the breath is long, to notice that the breath is long, if the breath is short, to notice that the breath is short.&lt;ref&gt;Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No. 118, Section No. 2, translated from the Pali&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Satipatthana Sutta]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the "New Burmese Method," the practitioner [[Sati (Buddhism)|pays attention]] to any arising mental or physical phenomenon, engaging in [[vitaka]], noting or naming physical and mental phenomena ("breathing, breathing"), without engaging the phenomenon with further conceptual thinking.&lt;ref name="Practical"&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, ''Practical Vipassana Instructions''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhante Bodhidhamma, [https://buddhismnow.com/2013/09/12/vipassana-as-taught-by-the-mahasi-sayadaw-of-burma/ ''Vipassana as taught by The Mahasi Sayadaw of Burma'']&lt;/ref&gt; By noticing the arising of physical and mental phenomena, the meditator becomes aware how sense impressions arise from the contact between the senses and physical and mental phenomena,&lt;ref name="Practical"/&gt; as described in the five ''[[skandhas]]'' and ''[[paṭiccasamuppāda]]''. According to Sayadaw U Pandita, awareness and observation of these sensations is de-coupled from any kind of physical response, which is intended to recondition one's impulsive responses to stimuli, becoming less likely to physically or emotionally overreact to the happenings of the world&lt;ref&gt;Sayadaw U Pandita, [http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1465 ''How to Practice Vipassana Insight Meditation''], Lion's Roar&lt;/ref&gt;

The practitioner also becomes aware of the perpetual changes involved in breathing, and the arising and passing away of mindfulness.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt; This noticing is accompanied by reflections on [[paṭiccasamuppāda|causation]] and other Buddhist teachings, leading to insight into [[dukkha]], [[anatta]], and [[anicca]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, ''Practical Vipassana Instructions'', p.22-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Art"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhamma.org/en/art.shtml |title=The Art of Living: Vipassana Meditation |publisher=Dhamma.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the three characteristics have been comprehended, reflection subdues, and the process of noticing accelerates, noting phenomena in general, without necessarily naming them.&lt;ref&gt;PVI, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nyanaponika|1998}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=133}}

====Stages of Jhana in the Vipassana movement====
Vipassanā jhanas are stages that describe the development of samatha in ''vipassanā'' meditation practice as described in modern Burmese Vipassana meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, Daniel (2008), ''Mastering the core teachings of the Buddha'', Karnac Books, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Mahasi Sayadaw]]'s student [[Sayadaw U Pandita]] described the four ''vipassanā jhanas'' as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Sayadaw U Pandita, ''In this very life''&lt;/ref&gt;
# The meditator first explores the body/mind connection as one, nonduality; discovering three characteristics. The first jhana consists in seeing these points and in the presence of ''[[vitakka]]'' and ''[[vicara]]''. Phenomena reveal themselves as appearing and ceasing.
# In the second ''jhana'', the practice seems effortless. ''Vitaka'' and ''vicara'' both disappear.
# In the third ''jhana'', ''[[Pīti|piti]]'', the joy, disappears too: there is only happiness (''[[sukha]]'') and concentration.
# The fourth ''jhana'' arises, characterised by purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. The practice leads to direct knowledge. The comfort disappears because the dissolution of all phenomena is clearly visible. The practice will show every phenomenon as unstable, transient, disenchanting. The desire of freedom will take place.

==Northern tradition and Mahāyāna==

===Texts===
The north Indian Buddhist traditions like the [[Sarvastivada]] and the [[Sautrantika]] practiced ''vipaśyanā'' meditation as outlined in texts like the [[Abhidharmakosha]] of [[Vasubandhu]] and the [[Yogacarabhumi]]. The Abhidharmakosha states that ''vipaśyanā'' is practiced once one has reached [[samadhi]] (absorption) by cultivating the [[four foundations of mindfulness]] (''smrtyupasthanas'').&lt;ref name="Vallee Poussin page 925"&gt;De La Vallee Poussin (trans.); Pruden, Leo M. (trans.) ''Abhidharmakosabhasyam of Vasubandhu'' Vol. III page 925&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved according to [[Vasubandhu]]:
{{quote|By considering the unique characteristics (''svalaksana'') and the general characteristics (''samanyalaksana'') of the body, sensation, the mind, and the dharmas."&lt;br&gt;'The unique characteristics' means its self nature (''svabhava'').&lt;br&gt;The general characteristics" signifies the fact that "All conditioned things are impermanent; all impure dharmas are suffering; and that all the dharmas are empty (''sunya'') and not-self (''anatmaka'').&lt;ref name="Vallee Poussin page 925"/&gt;}}

Asanga's [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states that the practice of ''śamatha''-''vipaśyanā'' is a part of a Bodhisattva's path at the beginning, in the first "path of preparation" (''Sambharamarga'').&lt;ref&gt;Rahula; Boin-Webb. Abhidharmasamuccaya The Compendium of the Higher Teaching by Asanga, 1971 page xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

The later Indian Mahayana scholastic tradition, as exemplified by [[Shantideva]]'s [[Bodhicaryavatara]], saw ''śamatha'' as a necessary prerequisite to ''vipaśyanā'' and thus one needed to first begin with calm abiding meditation and then proceed to insight. In the Panjika commentary of Prajnakaramati on the [[Bodhicaryavatara]], ''vipaśyanā'' is defined simply as "wisdom (''[[prajña]]'') that has the nature of thorough knowledge of reality as it is."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. Alan; Wallace, Vesa A. A guide to the bodhisattva way of life (Bodhicaryavatara) by Santideva, Snow Lion Publications Ithaca, New York US, page 90, http://www.drepunggomangusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shantideva-bodhicaryavatara-wallace.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sunyata''===
[[Mahāyāna]] ''vipaśyanā'' differs from the Theravada tradition in its strong emphasis on the meditation on emptiness ([[shunyata]]) of all phenomena. The Mahayana ''Akṣayamati-nirdeśa'' refers to vipaśyanā as seeing phenomena as they really are, that is, empty, without self, nonarisen, and without grasping. The [[Prajnaparamita]] sutra in 8,000 lines states that the practice of insight is the non-appropriation of any dharmas, including the [[five aggregates]]:
{{quote|So too, a Bodhisattva coursing in perfect wisdom and developing as such, neither does nor even can stand in form, feeling, perception, impulse and consciousness...This concentrated insight of a Bodhisattva is called 'the non-appropriation of all dharmas'.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock (Copper), Richard (trans.) '''The Prajna Paramita Sutra on the Buddha-Mother's Producing the Three Dharma Treasures, Spoken by the Buddha''' (Also known as:) The Perfection of Wisdom in 8000 Lines, '''The Smaller Prajna Paramita Sutra (Tripitaka: 0227)'''(Taisho Tripitaka: 0228) , '''Translated into Chinese during Song Dynasty by Tripitaka Master Danapala, chapter 1. http://www.fodian.net/world/0228_01.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Likewise the Prajnaparamita in 25,000 lines states that a Bodhisattva should know the nature of the five aggregates as well as all dharmas thus:
{{quote|That form, etc. [feeling, perception, impulse and consciousness], which is like a dream, like an echo, a mock show, a mirage, a reflection of the moon in water, an apparition, that is neither bound nor freed. Even so form, etc., which is past, future, or present, is neither bound nor freed. And why? Because of the nonbeing-ness of form, etc. Even so form, etc., whether it be wholesome or unwholesome, defiled or undefiled, tainted or untainted, with or without outflows, worldly or supramundane, defiled or purified, is neither bound nor freed, on account of its non-beingness, its isolatedness, its quiet calm, its emptiness, signless-ness, wishless-ness, because it has not been brought together or produced. And that is true of all dharmas.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom: With the Divisions of the Abhisamayalankara (Center for South and Southeast Asia Studies, UC Berkeley) page 141&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sudden insight===
The [[Sthaviravāda]], one of the [[early Buddhist schools]] from which the Theravada-tradition originates, emphasized sudden insight:
{{quote|In the Sthaviravada [...] progress in understanding comes all at once, 'insight' (''abhisamaya'') does not come 'gradually' (successively - ''anapurva'').{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=284}}}}

The [[Mahasanghika]], another one of the early Buddhist schools, had the doctrine of ''ekaksana-citt'', "according to which a Buddha knows everything in a single thought-instant".{{sfn|Gomez|1991|p=69}}{{citation not found}} This process however, meant to apply only to the Buddha and Peccaka buddhas. Lay people may have to experience various levels of insights to become fully enlightened.

The [[Mahayana]] tradition emphasizes [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], insight into [[sunyata]], [[dharmata]], the [[two truths doctrine]], clarity and emptiness, or bliss and emptiness:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Defined by Reginald A. Ray |url=http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2004/summer/dharma_dictionary.htm |title="Vipashyana," by Reginald A. Ray.

{{quote|[T]he very title of a large corpus of early Mahayana literature, the ''[[Prajnaparamita]]'', shows that to some extent the historian may extrapolate the trend to extol insight, ''prajna'', at the expense of dispassion, ''viraga'', the control of the emotions.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=133}}}}

Although Theravada and Mahayana are commonly understood as different streams of Buddhism, their practice however, may reflect emphasis on insight as a common denominator:
{{quote|In practice and understanding Zen is actually very close to the Theravada Forest Tradition even though its language and teachings are heavily influenced by Taoism and Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhikkhucintita.wordpress.com/category/buddhism/page/3/ |title=Through the Looking Glass, '&amp;#39;Essential Buddhism'&amp;#39; |publisher=Bhikkhucintita.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Khantipalo recommends the use of the koan-like question [[Hua Tou|"Who?"]] to penetrate "this not-self-nature of the five aggregates": "In Zen Buddhism this technique has been formulated in several [[koan]]s, such as 'Who drags this corpse around?'"{{sfn|Khantipalo|1984|p=71}}}}}}

The emphasis on insight is discernible in the emphasis in [[Chinese Chán#Sudden and gradual enlightenment|Chán]] on [[subitism|sudden insight]],{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=284}} though in the Chán-tradition this insight is to be followed by gradual cultivation.{{refn|group=note|This "gradual training" is expressed in teachings as [[Five Ranks|the Five ranks of enlightenment]], [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]] which detail the steps on the Path, [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|The Three mysterious Gates]] of Linji, and the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]].}}

===East Asian Mahāyāna===
In [[Chinese Buddhism]], the works of Tiantai master [[Zhiyi]] (such as the [[Mohe Zhiguan]], "Great [[śamatha]]-vipaśyanā") are some of the most influential texts which discuss ''vipaśyanā'' meditation from a [[Mahāyāna]] perspective. In this text [[Zhiyi]] teaches the contemplation of the [[skandhas]], [[ayatanas]], [[Skandha#Eighteen Dh.C4.81tus|dhātus]], the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|Kleshas]], false views and several other elements.&lt;ref&gt;Fa Qing,[https://web.archive.org/web/20150524090134/http://elibrary.ibc.ac.th/files/public/2013seminabook.pdf The Śamatha and Vipaśyanā in Tian Tai], Poh Ming Tse Symposium 2013: One Master Three Meditative Traditions. Singapore, August 30, 2013; pp.30-47&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the influential text called the [[Awakening of Faith]] scripture has a section on calm and insight meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt; It states:
{{quote|He who practices 'clear observation' should observe that all conditioned phenomena in the world are unstationary and are subject to instantaneous transformation and destruction; that all activities of the mind arise and are extinguished from moment or moment; and that, therefore, all of these induce suffering. He should observe that all that had been conceived in the past was as hazy as a dream, that all that is being conceived in the future will be like clouds that rise up suddenly. He should also observe that the physical existences of all living beings in the world are impure and that among these various filthy things there is not a single one that can be sought after with joy.&lt;ref&gt;Hakedas, Yoshito, S. The Awakening of Faith in Mahayana, Attributed to Asvaghosha, 1967, page 33, http://www.acharia.org/downloads/the_awakening_of_faith_in_mahayana_english.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Chan ([[Zen]]) Buddhist tradition advocates the simultaneous practice of ''śamatha'' and ''vipaśyanā'', and this is called the practice of [[Shikantaza#Silent illumination|Silent Illumination]].&lt;ref name="Guo Gu"&gt;Guo Gu, Silent Illumination [https://www.bcbsdharma.org/author/guogu/ Guo Gu], Insight Journal 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The classic Chan text known as the [[Platform Sutra]] states:
{{quote|Calming is the essence of wisdom. And wisdom is the natural function of calming [i.e., prajñā and samādhi]. At the time of prajñā, samādhi exists in that. At the time of samādhi, prajñā exists in that. How is it that samādhi and prajñā are equivalent? It is like the light of the lamp. When the lamp exists, there is light. When there is no lamp, there is darkness. The lamp is the essence of light. The light is the natural function of the lamp. Although their names are different, in essence, they are fundamentally identical. The teaching of samādhi and prajñā is just like this.&lt;ref name="Guo Gu"/&gt;}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
{{Main|Vajrayana|Tibetan Buddhism}}

''Samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are explicitly referred to in Tibetan Buddhism. According to Thrangu Rinpoche, when ''shamatha'' and ''vipashyana'' are combined, as in the mainstream tradion Madhyamaka approach of ancestors like [[Shantideva]] and [[Kamalashila]], through ''samatha'' disturbing emotions are abandoned, which thus facilitates ''vipashyana'', "clear seeing." ''Vipashyana'' is cultivated through reasoning, logic and analysis in conjunction with Shamatha. In contrast, in the siddha tradition of the direct approach of [[Mahamudra]] and [[Dzogchen]], ''vipashyana'' is ascertained directly through looking into one's own mind. After this initial recognition of ''vipashyana'', the steadiness of ''shamatha'' is developed within that recognition. According to Thrangu Rinpoche, it is however also common in the direct approach to first develop enough ''shamatha'' to serve as a basis for ''vipashyana''.&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu Rinpoche, Essentials of Mahamudra&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the classical practice of ''śamatha'' and ''vipaśyanā'' is strongly influenced by the Mahāyāna text called the [[Bhavanakrama]] of Indian master [[Kamalaśīla]]. Kamalaśīla defines ''vipaśyanā'' as "the discernment of reality" (''bhūta-pratyavekṣā'') and "accurately realizing the true nature of dharmas".&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Martin T. Two Concepts of Meditation and Three Kinds of Wisdom in Kamalaśīla’s Bhāvanākramas: A Problem of Translation. University of Victoria, page 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism employed both [[deductive reasoning|deductive investigation]] (applying ideas ''to'' experience) and [[inductive reasoning|inductive investigation]] (drawing conclusions ''from'' direct experience) in the practice of vipaśyanā.{{refn|group=note|Corresponding respectively to the "contemplative forms" and "experiential forms" in the Theravāda school described above}}{{refn|group=note|Leah Zahler: "The practice tradition suggested by the Treasury &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[Abhidharma-kośa]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; .. . &amp;mdash; and also by Asaṅga's Grounds of Hearers &amp;mdash; is one in which mindfulness of breathing becomes a basis for inductive reasoning on such topics as the five aggregates; as a result of such inductive reasoning, the meditator progresses through the Hearer paths of preparation, seeing, and meditation. It seems at least possible that both Vasubandhu and Asaṅga presented their respective versions of such a method, analogous to but different from modern Theravāda insight meditation, and that Gelukpa scholars were unable to reconstruct it in the absence of a practice tradition because of the great difference between this type of inductive meditative reasoning based on observation and the types of meditative reasoning using consequences (''thal 'gyur, prasaanga'') or syllogisms (''sbyor ba, prayoga'') with which Gelukpas were familiar. Thus, although Gelukpa scholars give detailed interpretations of the systems of breath meditation set forth in Vasubandu's and Asaṅga's texts, they may not fully account for the higher stages of breath meditation set forth in those texts [...] it appears that neither the Gelukpa textbook writers nor modern scholars such as Lati Rinpoche and Gendun Lodro were in a position to conclude that the first moment of the fifth stage of Vasubandhu's system of breath meditation coincides with the attainment of special insight and that, therefore, the first four stages must be a method for cultivating special insight [although this is clearly the case].&lt;ref&gt;Zahler 108, 113&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Leah Zahler, only the tradition of deductive analysis in vipaśyanā was transmitted to Tibet in the sūtrayāna context.{{refn|group=note|This tradition is outlined by Kamalaśīla in his three ''[[Bhāvanākrama]]'' texts (particularly the second one), following in turn an approach described in the ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.&lt;ref name="Kamalasila 2008, p 3"&gt;"Some Notes on Kamalasila's Understanding of Insight Considered as the Discernment of Reality (bhūta-pratyavekṣā)", by Martin Adam, ''Buddhist Studies Review'', Vol. 25, No.2, 2008, p 3&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar describes his approach thus: "the overall picture painted by Kamalaśīla is that of a kind of serial alternation between observation and analysis that takes place entirely within the sphere of meditative concentration" in which the analysis portion consists of [[Madhyamaka]] reasonings.&lt;ref name="Kamalasila 2008, p 3"/&gt;}}

In Tibet direct examination of moment-to-moment experience as a means of generating insight became exclusively associated with vajrayāna.&lt;ref name="TR" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to contemporary Tibetan scholar Thrangu Rinpoche the Vajrayana cultivates direct experience. Thrangu Rinpoche: "The approach in the sutras [...] is to develop a conceptual understanding of emptiness and gradually refine that understanding through meditation, which eventually produces a direct experience of emptiness [...] we are proceeding from a conceptual understanding produced by analysis and logical inference into a direct experience [...] this takes a great deal of time [...] we are essentially taking inferential reasoning as our method or as the path. There is an alternative [...] which the Buddha taught in the tantras [...] the primary difference between the sutra approach and the approach of Vajrayana (secret mantra or tantra) is that in the sutra approach, we take inferential reasoning as our path and in the Vajrayana approach, we take direct experience as our path. In the Vajrayana we are cultivating simple, direct experience or "looking." We do this primarily by simply looking directly at our own mind."&lt;ref name="TR"&gt;''Pointing out the Dharmakaya'' by Thrangu Rinpoche. Snow Lion: 2003. {{ISBN|1-55939-203-7}}, pg 56&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche also explains: "In general there are two kinds of meditation: the meditation of the ''paṇḍita'' who is a scholar and the nonanalytical meditation or direct meditation of the ''kusulu'', or simple yogi. . . the analytical meditation of the paṇḍita occurs when somebody examines and analyzes something thoroughly until a very clear understanding of it is developed. . . The direct, nonanalytical meditation is called ''kusulu'' meditation in Sanskrit. This was translated as ''trömeh'' in Tibetan, which means "without complication" or being very simple without the analysis and learning of a great scholar. Instead, the mind is relaxed and without applying analysis so it just rests in its nature. In the sūtra tradition, there are some nonanalytic meditations, but mostly this tradition uses analytic meditation."&lt;ref&gt;''The Practice of Tranquillity &amp; Insight: A Guide to Tibetan Buddhist Meditation'' by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche. Shambhala Publications: 1994. {{ISBN|0-87773-943-9}} pg 91-93&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Mahamudra|Mahāmudrā]] and [[Dzogchen]] use vipaśyanā extensively. This includes some methods of the other traditions, but also their own specific approaches. They place a greater emphasis on meditation on symbolic images. Additionally in the Vajrayāna ([[Tantra|tantric]]) path, the true nature of mind is [[pointing-out instruction|pointed out by the guru]], and this serves as a direct form of insight.{{refn|group=note|[[Thrangu Rinpoche]] describes the approach using a guru: "In the Sūtra path one proceeds by examining and analyzing phenomena, using reasoning. One recognizes that all phenomena lack any true existence and that all appearances are merely interdependently related and are without any inherent nature. They are empty yet apparent, apparent yet empty. The path of Mahāmudrā is different in that one proceeds using the instructions concerning the nature of mind that are given by one's guru. This is called taking direct perception or direct experiences as the path. The fruition of śamatha is purity of mind, a mind undisturbed by false conception or emotional afflictions. The fruition of vipaśyanā is knowledge (''prajnā'') and pure wisdom (''jñāna''). Jñāna is called the wisdom of nature of phenomena and it comes about through the realization of the true nature of phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu Rinpoche, Looking Directly at Mind : [[The Moonlight of Mahāmudrā]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Volker Helmut Manfred Zotz''' (born October 28, 1956) is an eminent [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]], [[religious studies]] scholar, [[Buddhologist]] and a prolific author.&lt;ref&gt;"Volker Zotz," in ''[[Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender]]'',  Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter 2011, 23rd edition ({{ISBN|978-3-598-23630-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
The Zotz family originated in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and spread to [[Germany]]. Volker Zotz was born in [[Landau in der Pfalz]], [[Germany]], where he attended elementary school and high school.

His interest in [[spirituality]] led him to an early study of [[Christianity]] as well as of [[Indian religions|Indian]] and [[Chinese religions]]. What impressed him most was Buddhist philosophy and meditation. When Zotz was sixteen he became a major disciple of [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]], with whom he was close until his death in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arya-maitreya-mandala.org/#amsterdam Major disciples of Lama Anagarika Govinda]&lt;/ref&gt; During his high school days, Zotz also met the author [[Oscar Kiss Maerth]], whose ideas he did not completely agree with, but with whom he had an intense exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donna Kossy]]: ''Strange creations: aberrant ideas of human origins.'' Feral House 2001, {{ISBN|9780922915651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Max Slevogt]] High School in Landau in the 1970s, he published his first poems in two volumes&lt;ref&gt;''Transformation.'' Scheden: Verlagsedition Dittmer 1978 ({{ISBN|3-88297-031-6}}) und ''Geraunt.'' Scheden und Hannoversch Münden 1979 ({{ISBN|3-88297-039-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; and a novel.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Projekt Adytum.'' Scheden und Hannoversch Münden 1979 ({{ISBN|3-88297-041-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[conscientious objector]] Zotz had to perform eighteen months of [[alternative civilian service]] in a nursing home. From 1978 he studied Buddhism under Ernst Steinkellner and [[philosophy]] under [[Kurt Rudolf Fischer]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. He repeatedly interrupted his studies in Vienna to conduct research and fieldwork in [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Afghanistan]] and to receive spiritual training from Lama Anagarika Govinda.

== Career ==
In 1986 Zotz received a Ph. D. from the University of Vienna for his [[thesis|doctoral thesis]] ''Zur Rezeption, Interpretation und Kritik des Buddhismus im deutschen Sprachraum.'' This dissertation investigates the influence of Buddhism on German philosophy, literature and culture during the [[Fin de siècle]].&lt;ref&gt;''International Bibliography of Austrian Philosophy 1986/87''. Amsterdam 1996, p.171 ({{ISBN|90-420-0036-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Zotz has been a [[lecturer]] of Buddhist philosophy at the University of Vienna. 1989 he moved to [[Japan]] where he was a [[professor]] and researcher at [[Ryukoku University]] and [[Otani University]] in [[Kyoto]] and at [[Rissho University]] in [[Tokyo]] for ten years. During the period in Japan he was influenced considerably by the Buddhologist [[Takamaro Shigaraki]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction by Volker Zotz to Takamaro Shigaraki: ''Sogar der Gute wird erlöst, um wie viel mehr der Böse. Der Weg des buddhistischen Meisters Shinran.'' Luxembourg 2004 ({{ISBN|2-9599829-2-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Zotz was appointed [[professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of Luxembourg]]. At that time he was also teaching at [[Saarland University]].

Besides his scholarly work, Volker Zotz’s European audience knows him as author and publicist. The volume, ''Buddha'', is the most popular book on its topic in German language, regularly reprinted and translated into several languages. Zotz is a leading member of the [[Arya Maitreya Mandala]], founded by Lama Anagarika Govinda in 1933. In the early 1990s Zotz initiated a study centre called ''Komyoji'' in Austria which is an attempt at describing a cross-cultural philosophy of religion. Since 1994 Zotz has been the driving force behind many of Komyoji’s educational programs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komyoji.at Komyoji Website]&lt;/ref&gt; such as workshops explaining various philosophical and theological topics. Volker Zotz is married to the Austrian writer and anthropologist [[Birgit Zotz]].

'''White pride''' or '''White power''' is an expression primarily used by [[white separatism|white separatist]], [[white nationalism|white nationalist]], [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] and [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] organizations in order to signal [[racism|racist]] or [[racialist]] viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van McVey|first=Sarah|title=Race, Gender, and the Contemporary White Supremacy Movement: The Intersection of "isms" and Organized Racist Groups|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabriel2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gabriel, John|title=Whitewash: Racialized Politics and the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80CEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|date=4 January 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-75016-0|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a slogan used by the prominent post-[[Ku Klux Klan]] group [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] and a term used to make racist/racialist viewpoints more palatable to the general public who may associate historical abuses with the terms "white nationalist", "neo-Nazi", and "white supremacist". However, "white pride" can also be associated with the many units of pride (such as "black pride") and is used as a counter-movement occasionally as a symbol to represent pride in Caucasians.

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] Betty A. Dobratz and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile identified "White Power! White Pride!" as "a much-used chant of white separatist movement supporters",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Dobratz| first=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2= Stephanie L.| title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: White Power, White Pride | place=Baltimore|  publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | year=2001 |isbn=0-8018-6537-9|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sociologist Mitch Berbrier has identified the use of this phrase as part of a "new racist&amp;nbsp;... frame-transformation and frame-alignment by (a) consciously packaging a 'hate-free' racism, (b) developing strategies of equivalence and reversal–presenting whites as equivalent to ethnic and racial minorities, and (c) deploying ideas about 'love,' 'pride,' and 'heritage-preservation' to evidence both their putative lack of animosity toward others as well as their ethnic credentials."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Half the Battle": Cultural Resonance, Framing Processes, and Ethnic Affectations in Contemporary White Separatist Rhetoric|url = http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/4/431|journal = Social Problems|date = 1998-11-01|issn = 0037-7791|pages = 431–450|volume = 45|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/3097206|language = en|first = Mitch|last = Berbrier|jstor = 3097206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[social psychology]] experiment that tested how white participants could be influenced to identify with white pride ideology, social psychologists framed white pride as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;[P]eople who openly express White pride seem invariably to be those alienated from the mainstream culture—KKK members, [[Skinhead|skin-heads]], and White supremacists—people trying to grab onto some basis for feeling good about themselves when conventional avenues such as successful careers and relationships are not working well for them.

Political and social scientists commonly argue that the idea of "white pride" is an attempt to provide a clean or more palatable public face for white supremacy or white separatism and that it is an appeal to a larger audience in hopes of inciting more widespread racial violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration |last=Swain |first=Carol M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-80886-3 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph T. Roy of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], white supremacists often circulate material on the internet and elsewhere that "portrays the groups not as haters, but as simple white pride civic groups concerned with social ills".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://judiciary.senate.gov/oldsite/91499jtr.htm |title=Statement of Joseph T.

By contrast, then, "affirmations of white pride—however thinly cloaked as affirmations of ethnic pride—serve to mask and perpetuate [[white privilege]]".&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |title=Rights, Democracy, and Fulfillment in the Era of Identity Politics: Principled Compromises in a Compromised World |last=Ingram |first=David |year=2004 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |place= Lanham, MD|isbn=0-7425-3348-4 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, Professor of Education at [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], Cris Mayo, characterizes white pride as "a politically distasteful goal, given that whiteness is not a personal or community identity, but has been a strategy to maintain [[social inequality|inequities]] of privilege and power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Certain Privilege: Rethinking White Agency {{!}} Mayo {{!}} Philosophy of Education Archive|url = http://ojs.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/pes/article/viewArticle/1675|website = ojs.ed.uiuc.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-04|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political science|Political scientists]] [[Carol M. Swain]] and Russell Nieli, in their text on white nationalism, identify the idea of "white pride" as a relatively new phenomenon in the United States. They argue that over the course of the 1990s, "a new white pride, white protest, and white consciousness movement has developed in America". They identify three contributing factors: an immigrant influx during the 1980s and 1990s, resentment over [[affirmative action]] policies, and the growth of the Internet as a tool for the expression and mobilization of grievances.&lt;ref name="swain5"&gt;*{{citation |last=Swain| first=Carol M. |last2=Nieli |first2=Russell|title=Contemporary Voices of White Nationalism in America |place=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| year=2003 |isbn=0-521-01693-2 |page=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Janet E. Helms]], founding director of [[Boston College]]'s Institute for the Study and Promotion of Race and Culture, a white person "must become aware of his or her Whiteness, accept it as personally and socially significant ... Not in the sense of Klan members' 'white pride' but in the context of a commitment to a just society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRof9vDClvQC|title="Why are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?": And Other Conversations about Race|last=Tatum|first=Beverly Daniel|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0465083617|language=en}}{{Page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among people who strongly identify as white, research differentiates between a power cognizant group and a prideful group. The prideful group is more likely to devalue diversity and to show prejudice, while the power cognizant group is more likely to value diversity.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/does_white_pride_lead_to_prejudice|title=Does White Pride Lead to Prejudice?|website=Greater Good|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Hasker''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|s|k|ər}}) is an American [[philosopher]] and Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[Huntington University (United States)|Huntington University]]. For many years he was editor of the prestigious journal ''[[Faith and Philosophy]]''. He has published many journal articles and books dealing with issues such as the [[mind–body problem]], [[theodicy]], and divine omniscience. He has argued for "[[Open Theism]]" and a view known as "[[emergentism]]" regarding the nature of the human person. Hasker regards the soul as an "emergent" substance, dependent upon the body for its existence.

Hasker received his Ph.D. in theology and philosophy of religion from The [[University of Edinburgh]]. His 1999 publication ''The Emergent Self'' discusses the [[philosophy of mind]] and attempts to establish that mind cannot be solely a material process but is also not completely distinct from its physical basis in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington College News Release (2002, Feb 17) ''Dr. William Hasker to discuss new book''.

'''Xuefeng Yicun''' (822-908) ({{zh|s=雪峰义存|w=Hsüeh-feng I-ts'un}}; {{zh|p=Xuěfēng Yìcún}}; {{Nihongo|Seppō Gison}}) was a [[Chinese Chán|Chinese Chan-master]] who was influential during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. The [[Yunmen school]] and [[Fayan school]] originated with descendants of his lineage.

==Biography==
According to the ''Wudeng Huiyuan'' ("Compendium of Five Lamps"){{sfn|Ferguson|2011}} Xuefeng Yicun was born in 822 in Nanan in ancient the district Quanzhou (now the province of [[Fujian]]). At age twelve he left home to live at Yujian Temple in Putian City.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011}}

During the [[Chinese Chán#The Great Persecution|suppression of Buddhism]] (841-846) by [[Emperor Xuānzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] Xuefeng Yicun was forced to leave the monastery. He continued his apprenticeship with a master Yuanzhao (Changzhao) on top of Furong (Lotus) Mountain in [[Hunan]].{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=92}}

When Emperor Xuanzong allowed for the restoration of Buddhism Xuefeng started hiking in the different regions of northern China.{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=92}} He received the full ordination of monks in 850 in the Baocha monastery in [[Youzhou]] (now Beijing) in the [[Hebei]] province.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011}}

Later he went to Wuling (near the modern city of Changde in Hunan province), and became a student and dharma heir of [[Deshan Xuanjian]] (782-865).{{sfn|Ferguson|2011}}

After his awakening Xuefeng returned to his former monastery on top of the Lotus Mountain,{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=94}} and then built a monastery on the top of Guangfu Xuefeng (Snow Summit) Top Xianggu (Elephant Bone).{{sfn|Ferguson|2011}} During the ''qianfu'' era (874-878) the monastery was officially recognized by the authorities. His teachings were supported by several officials in the Min region. As a result of his growing fame, Xuefeng was summoned to the court by palace officials. Xuefeng was awarded a purple robe and the title of "Grand Master of the truly enlightened" (''zhenjue dashi'') (or Grand Master of the True Enlightenment) by [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong]].{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=94}}

In 891 Xuefeng went to travel again. In 892 he had joined the attendants of [[Yang Xingmi]], the ruler of the newly established [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu (Jiangshi)]] regime, "cleansing soldiers with dharma-rain and performing ceremonies at Chan monasteries".{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=94}} This strengthened his reputation "as a Buddhist prelate who administered to the needs of local rulers".{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=94}} In 894 he returned to the Min region, where he was supported by [[Wang Chao (Tang Dynasty)|Wang Xu]]{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=94}} (r.891-897).{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=96}}  Wang Xu was followed by his brother [[Wang Shenzhi]] (r.897-925), under whose reign Buddhism became established in the Min region. Xuefeng had become a state prelate, who had a central role in promoting Buddhism,{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=96}} and who had to spread his influence throughout the entire region.{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=94}}

==Teachings==
The ''Runei lun fo xinjin lu'' ("Record of Discussions in the Palace regarding the Buddha Mind-seal") records his conversations with Wang Shenzhi.{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=96}} It is "highly reminiscent of earlied Chan precedents, particularly Bodhidharma's renunciation of the Liang emperor Wu recorded in the ''Platform sutra''.{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=98}} The records seem to be modelled according to the examples of Bodhidharma and Huineng.{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=99}}

Xuefeng's Chán-style was similar to that of [[Mazu Daoyi]].{{sfn|Wu|2011|p=204}}{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=99}} The phrase "Mind is Buddha", used by Xuefeng, was "allegedly introduced into Chan circles in the teaching attributed to Mazu Daoyi".{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=99}} But the same teaching is also attributed to Shitou.

==Influence and lineage==
Xuefeng was one of the most influential Chán-teachers at the end of the Tang Dynasty,{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=13}} when "a widely influential zen center formed around Xuefeng Yicun".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=169}} The loss of control by the Tang Dynasty, and the accompanying loss of support for Buddhist institutions, lead to a regionally based Chan of Xuefeng and his students.{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=90}}

===Students===
Xuefeng Yicun was the teacher of [[Yunmen Wenyan]] (862 or 864–949 CE), who established the [[Yunmen school]]. [[Fayan Wenyi]] (885-958), Xuefeng's "grand-disciple", established the [[Fayan school]].{{sfn|Jones|2010}}

Xuansha Shibei (WG Hsüan-sha Shih-pei) (835-908), a student of Xuefeng Yicun, is cited by [[Wumen Huikai]] (WG Wu-men Hui-k'ai, Jpn. Mumon Ekai) in explaining the title of his famous koan-collection, the ''[[Mumonkan]]'' ("Gateless barrier"), in explaining the title of this collection:

===Zutang ji===
The ''[[Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall|Zutang ji]]'' (祖堂集 "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall), compiled in 952, the first document which mentions [[Linji Yixuan]], was written to support the Xuefeng Yicun lineage.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} It pictures this lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou-school,{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} though Xuefeng Yicun's lineage is traced back to [[Shitou Xiqian]] (700-790). It was written by two students of Zhaoqing Wendeng (884-972), a dharma descendant of Xuefeng Yicun.
