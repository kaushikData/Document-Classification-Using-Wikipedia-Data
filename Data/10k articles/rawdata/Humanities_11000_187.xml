{{Arab culture}}
'''Arabic music''' ([[Arabic]]: الموسيقى العربية  – [[ALA-LC]]: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-mūsīqā al-‘Arabiyyah}}'') is the [[music]] of all the [[List of countries where Arabic is an official language|Arabic speaking countries]] with all its different [[List of music styles|music styles]] and [[genres]]. Arabic countries have many styles of music and also many [[Varieties of Arabic|dialects]]; each country has its own [[Folk music|traditional music]].

Arabic music has a long history of interaction with many other regional musical styles and genres. It represents the music of all the peoples that make up the [[Arab world]] today, all the 22 states. 

==History==

===Pre-Islamic period (Gulf Region) ===
Pre-Islamic [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf Arab]] music was similar to that of Ancient Middle Eastern music. Most historians agree that there existed distinct forms of music in the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the pre-Islamic period between the 5th and 7th century AD. [[Arabic poetry|Arab poets]] of that time—called ''shu`ara' al-Jahiliyah'' ([[Arabic]]: شعراء الجاهلية) or "Jahili poets", meaning "the poets of the period of ignorance"—used to recite poems with a high notes.&lt;ref name="Jahili"&gt;[http://www.khaledtrm.net/?p=74 ''Singing in the Jahili period'' – khaledtrm.net] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was believed that [[Genie|Jinns]] revealed poems to poets and music to musicians.&lt;ref name="Jahili" /&gt; The [[choir]] at the time served as a pedagogic facility where the educated poets would recite their poems. Singing was not thought to be the work of these intellectuals and was instead entrusted to women with beautiful voices who would learn how to play some instruments used at that time such as the [[drum]], the [[guitar]] or the [[rebab]], and perform the songs while respecting the [[poetic metre]].&lt;ref name="Jahili"/&gt; The compositions were simple and every singer would sing in a single ''[[Arabic maqam|maqam]]''. Among the notable songs of the period were the ''huda'' (from which the ''ghina'' derived), the ''nasb'', ''sanad'', and ''rukbani''.

===Early Islamic period===
[[File:Arabischer Maler um 730 002.jpg|thumb|An 8th century [[Umayyad]] [[fresco]] from [[Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi]], Syria.]]
Both [[musical composition|compositions]] and [[musical improvisation|improvisations]] in traditional Arabic music are based on the [[Arabic maqam|''maqam'']] system. ''Maqams'' can be realized with either [[vocal music|vocal]] or [[Musical instruments|instrumental]] music, and do not include a [[rhythm]]ic component.

[[Al-Kindi]] (801–873 AD) was a notable early theorist of Arabic music. He joined several others like [[al-Farabi]] in proposing the addition of a makeshift fifth string to the oud. He published several tracts on musical theory, including the cosmological connotations of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Farmer|first=Henry George|authorlink=Henry George Farmer|year=1988|title=Historical facts for the Arabian Musical Influence|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=0-405-08496-X|oclc=220811631}}. Pages 241 and 257.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified twelve tones on the Arabic musical scale, based on the location of fingers on and the strings of the oud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Risālāh fi khũbr ta‟alif al-alḥān|last1=al-Kindi|first1=Abu Yusuf|page=100-115|translator=SDS Abdoun|url=https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/11956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani|Abulfaraj]] (897–967) wrote the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', an encyclopedic collection of poems and songs that runs to over 20 volumes in modern editions.

[[Al-Farabi]] (872–950) wrote a notable book on [[Islamic music|music]] titled ''[[Kitab al-Musiqi al-Kabir]]'' (The Great Book of Music). His pure [[Arabian tone system]] is still used in Arabic music.&lt;ref name="Touma170"&gt;Habib Hassan Touma (1996), ''The Music of the Arabs'', p. 170, trans. Laurie Schwartz, Portland, Oregon: Amadeus Press, {{ISBN|0-931340-88-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Ghazali]] (1059–1111) wrote a treatise on music in [[Persia]] which declared, "Ecstasy means the state that comes from listening to music".

In 1252, [[Safi al-Din Urmawi|Safi al-Din]] developed a unique form of [[musical notation]], where [[rhythm]]s were represented by [[Geometry|geometric]] representation. A similar geometric representation would not appear in the [[Western world]] until 1987, when Kjell Gustafson published a method to represent a rhythm as a two-dimensional graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Godfried|last=Toussaint|title=A Comparison of Rhythmic Similarity Measures|publisher=5th International Conference on Music Information|date=August 2004|url=http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/research/reports/2004/SOCS-TR-2004.6.pdf|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Al-Andalus====
{{Main article|Andalusian classical music}}
By the 11th century, [[al-Andalus|Islamic Iberia]] had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually throughout [[France]], influencing French [[troubadour]]s, and eventually reaching the rest of Europe. The English words [[lute]], [[rebec]], and [[naqareh|naker]] are derived from Arabic [[oud]], [[rabab]], and [[naqareh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Douglas Alton|title=A History of the Lute from Antiquity to the Renaissance|year=2002|isbn=0-9714071-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Asian Music'' 32, no. 1: Tribal Music of India|url=http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/journals/archive/am/00449202_ap030061.html|accessdate=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Vague|date=September 2012}}&lt;!--This is an entire issue of the journal ''Asian Music'', comprising six articles and eight reviews. An author, article title, and page reference are all needed.--&gt;

===16th to 19th century===
[[Bartol Gyurgieuvits]] (1506–1566) spent 13 years as a slave in the [[Ottoman empire]]. After escaping, he published ''De Turvarum ritu et caermoniis'' in Amsterdam in 1544. It is one of the first European books to describe music in Islamic society. The origins of the "[[belly dance]]" are very obscure, as depictions and descriptions are rare. It may have originated in pre-Islamic Arabia. Examples have been found from 200 BCE, suggesting a possible pre-Islamic origin.

===20th century–present (Egypt and the Levant) ===
[[File:Umm Kulthum4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Umm Kulthum]]]]

In the early 20th century, [[Egypt]] was the first in a series of Arab countries to experience a sudden emergence of [[nationalism]], as it became independent after 2000 years of foreign rule. Any English, French or Turkish songs got replaced by national Egyptian music. [[Cairo]] became a center for musical innovation.

Female singers were some of the first to take a secular approach. [[Egypt]]ian performer [[Umm Kulthum (singer)|Umm Kulthum]] and Lebanese singer [[Fairuz]] were notable examples of this. Both have been popular through the decades that followed and both are considered legends of Arabic music. Across the Mediterranean, Moroccan singer [[Zohra Al Fassiya]] was the first female performer to achieve wide popularity in the Maghreb region, performing traditional Arab Andalusian folk songs and later recording numerous albums of her own.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Arabic music began to take on a more Western tone&amp;nbsp;– Egyptian artists [[Umm Kulthum]] and [[Abdel Halim Hafez]] along with composers [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]] and Baligh Hamdi pioneered the use of western instruments in Egyptian music. By the 1970s several other singers had followed suit and a strand of [[Arabic pop]] was born. Arabic pop usually consists of Western styled songs with Arabic instruments and lyrics. Melodies are often a mix between Eastern and Western. Beginning in the mid-1980s, [[Lydia Canaan]], musical [[Innovator|pioneer]] widely regarded as the first rock star of the [[Middle East]]&lt;ref name="Daily Star Rock Hall"&gt;O'Connor, Tom.

Western [[pop music]] was also being influenced by Arabic music in the early 1960s, leading to the development of [[surf music]], a [[rock music]] genre that later gave rise to [[garage rock]] and [[punk rock]].&lt;ref name="washfile"&gt;{{cite web|last=Holgate|first=Steve|title=Guitarist Dick Dale Brought Arabic Folk Song to Surf Music|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/September/20060914165844ndyblehs0.0821802.html|work=The Washington File|publisher=Bureau of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State|accessdate=29 August 2010|date=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surf rock pioneer [[Dick Dale]], a [[Lebanese American]] [[guitarist]], was greatly influenced by the Arabic music he learnt from his uncle, particularly the oud and derbakki (doumbek) drum, skills which he later applied to his [[electric guitar]] playing when recording surf rock in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="washfile"/&gt;

In the 1990s, several artists have taken up such a style including [[Amr Diab]], [[Najwa Karam]], [[Elissa (Lebanese singer)|Elissa]], [[Nawal Al Zoghbi]], [[Nancy Ajram]], [[Haifa Wehbe]], [[Angham]], [[Fadl Shaker]], [[Majida Al Roumi]], [[Wael Kfoury]], [[Asalah Nasri]], [[Myriam Fares]], [[Carole Samaha]], [[Yara (singer)|Yara]], [[Samira Said]], [[Hisham Abbas]], [[Kadhem Al Saher]], [[Mostafa Amar]], [[Ehab Tawfik]], [[Mohamed Fouad]], [[Diana Haddad]], [[Mohamed Mounir]], [[Latifa (singer)|Latifa]], [[Cheb Khaled]], [[George Wassouf]], [[Hakim (Egyptian singer)|Hakim]], [[Fares Karam]], [[Julia Boutros]], and [[Amal Hijazi]].

==Influence of Arabic music==
{{See also|Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|Influence of Arabic on other languages}}
[[File:MuslimMusiciansAtTheCourtOfRoger.JPG|thumb|upright|12th century Arabic painting of musicians in [[Palermo]], Sicily.]]
The names of a number of [[musical instrument]]s used in [[classical music]] are believed to be derived from Arabic terms, though many of the instruments themselves were already used in Europe. Words with Arabic origins include: [[lute]], derived from ''[[oud]]''; [[rebec]] (an ancestor of the [[violin]]) from ''[[rebab]]'', [[guitar]] from ''qitara'', [[naqareh|naker]] from ''[[naqareh]]'', [[adufe]] from ''[[Daf|al-duff]]'', [[alboka]] from ''al-buq'', [[Naffir|anafil]] from ''al-nafir'', exabeba (a type of [[flute]]) from ''al-shabbaba'', atabal (a type of [[bass drum]]) from ''al-tabl'', atambal from ''al-tinbal'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farmer|1988|p=136-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the [[Balaban (instrument)|balaban]], [[castanet]] from ''kasatan'', and [[Tuna (music)|sonajas de azófar]] from ''sunuj al-sufr''. Some of these words were used only in Spain and southern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farmer|1988|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of medieval [[Bore (wind instruments)|conical bore instruments]] were likely introduced or popularized by Arab musicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farmer|1988|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the xelami (from ''zulami'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farmer|1988|pp=140–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some scholars believe that the [[troubador]]s may have had Arabian origins, with [[Magda Bogin]] stating that the Arab poetic and musical tradition was one of several influences on European "courtly love poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogin|first1=Magda|last2=Bogin|first2=Meg|title=The Women Troubadours|year=1995|publisher=WW Norton|isbn=978-0393009651}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Évariste Lévi-Provençal]] and other scholars stated that three lines of a poem by [[William IX of Aquitaine]] were in some form of Arabic, indicating a potential Andalusian origin for his works. The scholars attempted to translate the lines in question and produced various different translations. The medievalist Istvan Frank contended that the lines were not Arabic at all, but instead the result of the rewriting of the original by a later scribe.&lt;ref name="Beech1992"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Troubadour Contacts with Muslim Spain and Knowledge of Arabic : New Evidence Concerning William IX of Aquitaine |journal=Romania|year=1992|page=14-26|last1=Beech|first1=George T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that the troubadour tradition was created by William after his experience of [[Moorish]] arts while fighting with the [[Reconquista]] in Spain has been championed by [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]] and [[Idries Shah]]. George T. Beech states that there is only one documented battle that William fought in Spain, and it occurred towards the end of his life. Beech adds that William and his father did have Spanish individuals within their extended family, and that while there is no evidence he himself knew Arabic, he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak the language.&lt;ref name="Beech1992" /&gt; Others state that the notion that William created the concept of troubadours is itself incorrect, and that his "songs represent not the beginnings of a tradition but summits of achievement in that tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dronke, ''The Medieval Lyric'', Perennial Library, 1968. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most scholars believe that [[Guido of Arezzo]]'s [[Solfège]] musical notation system had its origins in a Latin hymn,&lt;ref name="McNaught"&gt;{{cite journal  | last  = McNaught  | first      = W. G.  | year  = 1893  | title  = The History and Uses of the Sol-fa Syllables  | journal  = Proceedings of the Musical Association  | volume     = 19  | pages      = 35–51  | publisher  = Novello, Ewer and Co.  | issn  = 0958-8442  | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=nNYPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt; but others suggest that it may have had Arabic origins instead. It has been argued that the Solfège syllables (''do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti'') may have been derived from the syllables of an Arabic [[solmization]] system ''Durr-i-Mufassal'' ("Separated Pearls") (''dal, ra, mim, fa, sad, lam''). This was first proposed by Meninski in his ''Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalum'' (1680). However, there is no documentary evidence for this theory, and no Arabic musical manuscripts utilizing sequences from the Arabic alphabet are known to exist.&lt;ref name="Miller1973"&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/3345093|title=Guido d'Arezzo: Medieval Musician and Educator|first=Samuel D.|jstor=3345093|last=Miller|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|volume=21|issue=3|date=Autumn 1973|pages=239–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry George Farmer]] believes that there is no firm evidence on the origins of the notation, and therefore the Arabian origin theory and the hymnal origin theories are equally credible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farmer|1988|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franco-Arabic===
Franco-Arabic music is a popular form of West-meets-East style of music, similar in many respects to modern Arabic Pop. This blend of western and eastern music was popularized by artists such as [[Dalida]] (Egypt), Sammy Clark (Lebanon), and Aldo from Australia. Although Franco-Arabic music includes many forms of cross-cultural blending between the West and the Middle East, musically the genre crosses over many lines as is seen in songs that incorporate Arabic and Italian, Arabic and French and, of course, Arabic and English styles or lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Celli A. "Ya Catarì. La musica leggera franco-araba". In ''Alle radici dell'Europa. Mori giudei e zingari nei paesi del Mediterraneo occidentale'', vol. III, XX-XXI Century, ed. Felice Gambin. Verona: SEID, 2010 (155–174).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic R&amp;B, reggae, and hip hop===
{{Main article|Arabic hip hop}}
There has also been a rise of [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[reggae]] and [[hip hop]] influenced Arab music in the past couple of years. These songs usually feature a [[rapper]] in a traditional [[Arab pop]] song (such as [[Ishtar (singer)|Ishtar]]'s song 'Habibi Sawah'). The Moroccan singer [[Elam Jay]] developed a contemporary version of the [[Gnawa music|Gnawa]] genre that is fused with [[R&amp;B]] which he named ''Gnawitone Styla''. Another variation of contemporary [[Gnawa music|Gnawa]] played in [[Music of Morocco|Morocco]] is introduced by [[Darga]]. Based in [[Casablanca]], the group fuses [[Gnawa music|Gnawa]] with [[Reggae]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Political [[Reggae]] artists such as TootArd from the occupied [[Syrian]] [[Golan Heights]] from [[Haifa, Israel|Haifa]] (Originally from Iqrith) started gaining popularity in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] in 2011 after the [[YouTube]] premiere of a song about the [[Arab Spring]] (mainly the [[Tunisia]]n revolution), called "The Green Revolution", sung by them and an ensemble of Palestinian artists, most notable among them being Mahmoud Jrere of [[DAM (rap group)|DAM]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Notable is [[Shadia Mansour]], a Palestinian British rapper known as "The First Lady of Arab Hip Hop."{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Much of her music focuses on the Palestinian cause.

Also there is the [[Moroccan pop]] introduced by the Moroccan singer [[Oussama Belhcen]] who's mixing between the American and the Moroccan music in his songs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assabahia.com/%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3/ عودة الفنان الشاب أسامة بالحسن إلى الساحة الغنائية&lt;/ref&gt;

However certain artists have taken to using full R&amp;B and reggae beats and styling such as [[Darine]]. This has been met with mixed critical and commercial reaction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As of now it is not a widespread genre.

===Arabic electronica===
[[Electronic dance music]] is another genre to come out into popularity. Often, songs in this genre would combine electronic musical instruments with traditional Middle Eastern instruments. Artists like [[Richii]] popularized this style with songs like "Ana Lubnaneyoun".

===Arabic jazz===
Another popular form of West meets East, Arabic [[jazz]] is also popular, with many songs using jazz instruments. Early jazz influences began with the use of the saxophone by musicians like Samir Suroor, in the "oriental" style. The use of the saxophone in that manner can be found in [[Abdel Halim Hafez]]'s songs, as well as Kadim Al Sahir and Rida Al Abdallah today. The first mainstream jazz elements were incorporated into Arabic music by the [[Rahbani brothers]]. [[Fairuz]]'s later work was almost exclusively made up of jazz songs, composed by her son [[Ziad Rahbani]]. Ziad Rahbani also pioneered today's oriental jazz movement, to which singers including Rima Khcheich, Salma El Mosfi, and (on occasion) [[Latifa (singer)|Latifa]] adhere. We can also find a lot of jazz music in [[Mohamed Mounir]]'s songs starting from his first album [[Alemony Eneeki]] in 1977, and he is considered to be the King of Arabic Jazz and Arabic Music generally.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Another notable performer of this genre is the Palestinian singer [[Reem Kelani]] who blends jazz with Arabic music, both in her own compositions and in her arrangements of traditional songs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/aa5b1abe-a585-11db-a4e0-0000779e2340.html#axzz2xf64aPMK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albaath.news.sy/epublisher/html_np/13071/7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217130115/http://www.albaath.news.sy/epublisher/html_np/13071/7.html |archivedate=2010-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic Jazz has met many new kinds of composition since the end of the 20th century:
* Modal forms with [[Anouar Brahem]] and [[Rabih Abou Khalil]]
* Mixed electric sound experiences with [[Dhafer Youssef]]
* New pop jazz styles with [[Titi Robin]] and [[Toufic Farroukh]]
* Other acoustic youth experiences with [[Hamdi Makhlouf]], [[Amine and Hamza M'raihi|Amine &amp; Hamza M'raihi]] and [[Jasser Haj Youssef]]

===Arabic rock===
[[Rock music]] is popular all around the world, the Arab world being no exception. There have been many [[Arab]] [[Rock music|rock]] bands along the years that fused [[Rock music|rock]], [[Heavy metal music|metal]] and [[alternative rock]] sounds with traditional Arab instruments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Arabic rock has been gaining a lot of attention lately in the [[Middle East]] with bands like [[Cairokee]], [[JadaL]], [[Autostrad]], [[El Morabba3]]  and [[Akher Zapheer]] of [[Music of Jordan|Jordan]], [[The Wanton Bishops]], [[Mashrou' Leila]] and [[Meen (band)|Meen]] of [[Music of Lebanon|Lebanon]],  [[Massar Egbari]], Sahara, [[Wyvern]] and Cartoon Killerz of [[Music of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Khalas]], and Chaos of [[Music of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Acrassicauda]] of [[Music of Iraq|Iraq]]. The band [[Hoba Hoba Spirit]] from [[Music of Morocco|Morocco]] is also gaining popularity, especially in the [[Maghrebi]] region. [[Rachid Taha]], an [[Music of Algeria|Algerian]] musician, plays a fusion of [[Rock music|rock]] and [[raï]].

==Musical regions==
The world of modern Arabic music has long been dominated by musical trends that have emerged from [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. The city is generally considered a [[cultural center]] in the Arab world. Innovations in popular music via the influence of other regional styles have also abounded from [[Morocco]] to [[Saudi Arabia]]. In recent years, [[Beirut]] has become an important city where singers can fluently sing in various [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic Dialects]]. Other regional styles that have enjoyed [[popular music]] status throughout the Arab world, including:

==Sacred and Art music==

===Sacred music===
Arabic [[religious music]] includes [[Jewish music|Jewish]] ([[Pizmonim]] and [[Baqashot]]), [[Christian music|Christian]], and [[Islamic music|Islamic]] music. However, Islamic music, including the ''[[Tajwid]]'' or recitation of [[Qur'an reading]]s, is structurally equivalent to Arabic secular music, while [[Christian Arab]] music has been influenced by [[Syriac sacral music|Syriac Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Anglican]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]], and [[Maronite]] church music.&lt;ref&gt;Touma 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;152.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art music===
Secular [[art music]]al genres include [[maqam al-iraqi]], [[andalusi nubah]], [[muwashshah]], [[Fjiri song]]s, [[qasidah]], [[layali]], [[mawwal]], [[taqsim]], [[bashraf]], [[sama'i]], [[tahmilah]],&lt;!--Why was this earlier spelled "tashmilah"?--&gt; [[dulab]], [[sawt (music)|sawt]], and [[liwa (music)|liwa]].&lt;ref&gt;Touma 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of Arabic music==
[[File:Ernst Rudolph The Musician.jpg|thumb|''The Musician'' by [[Rudolf Ernst]].]]
Much of Arabic music is characterized by an emphasis on [[melody]] and [[rhythm]], as opposed to [[harmony]]. There are some genres of Arabic music that are [[polyphonic]], but typically, Arabic music is [[homophony|homophonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Arabianm.html "Arabian music" on the on-line edition of The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, at www.encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Habib Hassan Touma]] submits that there are five components that characterize Arabic music:&lt;ref&gt;Touma (1996), p.xix-xx.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[Arab tone system]]; that is, a [[musical tuning]] system that relies on specific interval structures and was invented by [[al-Farabi]] in the 10th century&lt;ref name="Touma170"/&gt;
# Rhythmic-temporal structures that produce a rich variety of [[rhythm]]ic patterns, known as ''[[Rhythm in Arabian music|awzan]]'' or "weight", that are used to accompany metered vocal and instrumental genres, to accent or give them form.
# A number of [[musical instrument]]s that are found throughout the Arab world that represent a standardized [[tone system]], are played with generally standardized performance techniques, and display similar details in construction and design.
# Specific social contexts that produce sub-categories of Arabic music, or musical genres that can be broadly classified as urban (music of the city inhabitants), rural (music of the country inhabitants), or [[Bedouin]] (music of the desert inhabitants)..."
# An Arab musical mentality, "responsible for the esthetic homogeneity of the tonal-spatial and rhythmic-temporal structures throughout the Arab world whether [[musical composition|composed]] or [[improvise]]d, [[instrumental]] or [[vocal]], [[secular]] or [[sacred]]." Touma describes this musical mentality as being composed of many things.

===Maqam system===
{{see also|Arabian maqam}}
[[File:Maqam tone level example.PNG|thumb|right|350px|A Maqam tone level example]]
The basis of Arabic music is the [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] (pl. maqamat), which looks like the mode, but is not quite the same.{{Clarify|date=June 2014}}&lt;!--What is this mode, and how exactly does the maqam differ from it?--&gt; The [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] note, [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] note, and ending note (unless modulation occurs) are generally determined by the maqam used. Arabic maqam theory as ascribed in literature over the ages names between 90 and 110 maqams, that are grouped into larger categories known as fasilah. Fasilah are groupings of maqams whose first four primary pitches are shared in common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musiq.com/makam/page0.html http://www.musiq.com/makam/page0.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108150638/http://www.musiq.com/makam/page0.html |date=2006-11-08 }} ''Musiq.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ajnas====
{{Main article|Jins}}
The maqam consists of at least two ''ajnas'', or scale segments. ''Ajnas'' is the plural form of ''jins'', which in Arabic comes from the Latin word ''genus'', meaning "type". In practice, a jins is either a [[trichord]] (three notes), a [[tetrachord]] (four notes), or a [[pentachord]] (five notes). A maqam usually covers only one [[octave]] (usually two ajnas), but can cover more. Like the melodic minor scale, some maqamat use different ajnas when descending and ascending. Due to continuous innovation and the emergence of new ajnas, and because most music scholars have not reached consensus on the subject, a solid figure for the total number of ajnas in use is uncertain. In practice, however, most musicians would agree there are at least eight major ajnas: ''rast'', ''bayat'', ''sikah'', ''hijaz'', ''saba'', ''kurd'', ''nahawand'', and ''ajam'', and commonly used variants such as ''nakriz'', ''athar kurd'', ''sikah beladi'', ''saba zamzama''. ''Mukhalif'' is a rare jins used almost exclusively in Iraq, and it is not used in combination with other ajnas.

===Microtones in Arabic music===
Unlike the tradition of Western music, Arabic music contains [[Microtonal music|microtones]], which are notes that lie between notes in the Western [[chromatic scale]]. While notes in the chromatic scale are separated by [[semitones]] (or half steps), notes in Arabic music can be separated by [[quarter tones]]. In some treatments of theory, the quarter tone scale or all twenty four tones should exist, but according to [[Yusuf Shawqi|Yūsuf Shawqī]] (1969), fewer tones are used in practice.&lt;ref name="Touma170"/&gt;

Additionally, in 1932, at the [[Cairo Congress of Arab Music]] held in Cairo, Egypt—and attended by such Western luminaries as [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Henry George Farmer]]—experiments were done that determined conclusively that the notes in actual use differ substantially from an even-tempered 24-tone scale. Furthermore, the intonation of many of those notes differ slightly from region to region (Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Iraq).

====Regional scales====
As a result of these findings, the following recommendation was issued: "The tempered scale and the natural scale should be rejected. In Egypt, the Egyptian scale is to be kept with the values, which were measured with all possible precision. The Turkish, Syrian, and Iraqi scales should remain what they are...."&lt;ref&gt;Maalouf, Shireen (2002). ''History of Arabic Music Theory: Change and Continuity in the Tone Systems, Genres, and Scales'', p.220. Kaslik, Lebanon: Université Saint-Esprit.&lt;/ref&gt; Both in modern practice, and evident in recorded music over the course of the last century, several differently-tuned Es in between the E-flat and E-natural of the Western Chromatic scale are used, that vary according to the types of maqams and ajnas used, and the region in which they are used.

====Practical treatment====
Musicians and teachers refer to these in-between notes as [[quarter tone]]s, using "half-flat" or "half-sharp" as a designation for the in-between flats and sharps, for ease of nomenclature. Performance and teaching of the exact values of intonation in each jins or maqam is usually done by ear. It should also be added, in reference to [[Habib Hassan Touma]]'s comment above, that these quarter tones are not used everywhere in the maqamat: in practice, Arabic music does not modulate to 12 different tonic areas like the [[Well-Tempered Klavier]]. The most commonly used quarter tones are on E (between E and E{{Music|flat}}), A, B, D, F (between F and F{{Music|sharp}}), and C.

===Vocal traditions===
Arab classical music is known for its famed virtuoso singers, who sing long, elaborately ornamented, melismatic tunes, and are known for driving audiences into ecstasy. Its traditions come from pre-[[Islam]]ic times, when female singing [[slavery|slaves]] entertained the wealthy, inspired warriors on the battlefield with their rajaz poetry, and performed at [[wedding]]s.

===Instruments and ensembles===
{{Main|Arabic musical instruments}}
[[File:Abdel wahab.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mohammed Abdel Wahab|Mohamed Abdel Wahab]] playing a [[mandolin-banjo]] in [[Ghazal Al Banat|Ghazal al-Banat]].]]

The prototypical Arabic music ensemble in Egypt and Syria is known as the [[Takht (music)|takht]], and includes, (or included at different time periods) instruments such as the [['oud]], [[kanun (instrument)|qānūn]], [[rabab]], [[ney]], [[violin]] (introduced in the 1840s or 50s), [[riq]] and [[goblet drum|dumbek]]. In Iraq, the traditional ensemble, known as the [[chalga|chalghi]], includes only two melodic instruments—the jowza (similar to the rabab but with four strings) and [[Santur (Iraqi instrument)|santur]]—accompanied by the [[riq]] and [[dumbek]]. The Arab world has incorporated instruments from the West, including the [[electric guitar]], [[cello]], [[double bass]] and [[oboe]], and incorporated influences from jazz and other foreign musical styles.

The singers have remained the stars, however, especially after the development of the recording and film industry in the 1920s in [[Cairo]]. These singing celebrities are (or were) the biggest stars in Arabic classic music, they include [[Farid al-Atrash|Farid Al Attrache]], [[Asmahan]], [[Abdel Halim Hafez]], [[Sayed Darwish]], [[Mohamed Abdel Wahab]], [[Warda Al-Jazairia]], [[Wadih El Safi]], [[Fairuz]], [[Sabah (singer)|Sabah]], and [[Umm Kulthum]]

The '''auditory moving-window''' is a [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] paradigm developed at [[Michigan State University]] by Fernanda Ferreira and colleagues.&lt;ref name="Ferreira"&gt;Ferreira, F., Henderson, J.M., Anes, M.D., Weeks, P.A., Jr., McFarlane, D.K. (1996). Effects of lexical frequency and syntactic complexity in spoken-language comprehension: Evidence from the auditory moving-window technique. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition'', 22(2), 324-335.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferreira and colleagues built the paradigm in order to address the scarcity of (fluent) spoken-language comprehension literature versus the robustness of that for visual-word processing. Auditory moving-window can be used to assess indirectly the processing load of a sentence: this processing load is assessed by an analogue of reaction time within the paradigm (discussed below). Reaction times within the paradigm are sensitive to at least word frequency and garden path effects.

The paradigm has been used in the study of syntactic processing in the study of [[Aphasia|aphasic patients]]. One such study suggests that many aphasic patients retain their abilities to process syntactic structures on-line. Further, evidence suggests that [[Expressive aphasia|Expressive aphasics]] have a degraded ability to process complex syntax on-line, whereas [[Receptive aphasia|Receptive aphasics]] are impaired only after on-line comprehension concludes &lt;ref&gt;Caplan, D., Waters, G. (2003). On-line syntactic processing in aphasia: Studies with auditory moving window presentation. ''Brain and Language'', 84, 222-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of the auditory moving-window==
The auditory moving-window paradigm, because of its similarity to the eye tracking paradigm, has a broad range of applications. It is at least sensitive enough to detect frequency effects on comprehension: low frequency words had a greater IRT and DT than high frequency words, suggesting a relative difficulty of lexical access.&lt;ref name="Ferreira" /&gt; Further, it is sensitive to [[Garden path sentence|garden path effects]]&lt;ref name="Ferreira" /&gt;

==Technical details==
;Stimuli preparation
Because one of the aims of the auditory moving-window is to investigate fluent speech, the paradigm is several steps more complex than simple auditory word-by-word presentation:
*To begin, a speaker records an unbroken sample of speech.
*Following this, the researcher using the paradigm artificially segments the sample, using an audio-editing software such as Computerized Speech Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kayelemetrics.com/index.php?option=com_product&amp;controller=product&amp;Itemid=3&amp;cid[]=11&amp;task=pro_details&lt;/ref&gt;
**The segment size is contingent on the target of the research. In Ferreira et al. (1996), segments follow [[Phrase structure grammar|phrasal]] boundaries. The practical limit seems to be clausal at the poorest resolution, verbal at the finest: the auditory moving-window is meant to capture "fluent" speech, which in natural production includes at least the [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] information of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].
*After the speech sample has been segmented, the researcher may choose to regularize variables such as [[amplitude]] or [[sampling rate]] of the segments.
**A completed sample may read out as the following, where "^" indicates a segment bound:
***''George'' ^ ''looked'' ^ ''for'' ^ ''a new'' ^ ''chest'' ^ ''for'' ^ ''his European'' ^ ''clothes''.
*At the end of a sample, the researcher may elect to insert a single tone to indicate the end of the sample, as sentence-final prosody differs across sentence types and it may not be clear to the subject that the sample has in fact ended.

;Stimuli presentation
The presentation of a prepared sample depends on what software is being used. What follows is an abstraction of the general strategy.
*The software loads a sample during the experiment.
*The participant in the study initiates the sample presentation by pressing a "pacing button": this introduces the first segment.
*Each subsequent button press initiates the next segment. The software may be programmed such that segments must conclude before the next is available.
**The software monitors the time between button presses. This is the Inter-Response Time (IRT). The actual duration of the segment is subtracted from the IRT to yield the Difference Time (DT). This DT is the variable of interest.

;Analytical logic
The auditory moving-window is roughly analogous to an [[eye tracking]] task presented in the auditory modality. The eye tracking variable of interest that is thought to be closest to the DT is that of fixation duration. They are held to be directly related: a greater DT is correspondent to a greater fixation duration. Several eye-tracking studies use fixation duration as an indirect measure of processing load: a greater fixation duration is correspondent to a greater processing load .{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The same applies to DTs.

'''Biomedical tissue''' is [[Tissue (biology)|biological tissue]] used for [[organ transplant]]ation and medical research, particularly cancer research. When it is used for research it is a [[biological specimen]].

Such tissues and organs may be referred to as implant tissue, [[allograft]], [[xenograft]], [[skin graft]] tissue, human transplant tissue, or implant bone. Tissue is stored in tissue establishments or tissue banks under cryogenic conditions. Fluids such as blood, blood products and urine are stored in fluid banks under similar conditions.

==Regulation==
The collection, storage, analysis and transplantation of human tissue involves significant ethical and safety issues, and is heavily regulated. Each country sets its own framework for ensuring the safety of human tissue products.

The regulation of human transplantation in the [[United Kingdom]] is set out in the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]] and managed by the [[Human Tissue Authority]].&lt;ref name="HTA-remit"&gt;{{cite web |author=Human Tissue Authority |authorlink=Human Tissue Authority |title=Remit |url=http://www.hta.gov.uk/aboutus/remit/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225014634/http://www.hta.gov.uk/aboutus/remit/ |archivedate=2006-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tissue banks in the [[United States|US]] are monitored by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The [[Code of Federal Regulations]] sets out the following topics:&lt;ref name="CFR2003"&gt;{{cite web |author=Food and Drug Administration |authorlink=Food and Drug Administration |title=Part 1270: 'Human Tissue Intended for Transplantation' |year=2003 |work=Title 21--Food and Drugs |publisher=[[Code of Federal Regulations]] |url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_03/21cfr1270_03.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Donor Screening and Testing: the determination of donor suitability for human tissue intended for transplantation.
* Procedures and Records: the written procedures and records that must be kept
* Inspection of Tissue Establishments: the importation of tissues from abroad and the retention, recall, and destruction of human tissue.

==Notable regulation cases ==
* Biomedical Tissue Services, Inc. is at the heart of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration.&amp;nbsp;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615025419/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2005/NEW01249.html]

'''Bronllys''' is a village and [[Community (Wales)|community]] in [[Powys]], Wales between the nearby towns [[Brecon]] and [[Talgarth]]. Bronllys is also the name of an electoral ward to [[Powys County Council]].

==Description==
The village is in the historic county of [[Brecknockshire]] (Breconshire). It has recently benefited from a new bypass as part of the Talgarth Relief Road and Bronllys Bypass scheme. 

Despite being a small village it has a swimming pool and small leisure centre, post office and hospital.

== The castle ==
[[File:Bronllys Castle motte and tower - geograph.org.uk - 2469137.jpg|left|thumb|Bronllys Castle motte and tower]]Bronllys castle is a [[motte and bailey]] fortress standing south of the village, towards [[Talgarth]].  The castle was founded in or soon after 1144 when the district was granted to [[Walter de Clifford (died 1190)|Walter de Clifford]] (died 1190) by [[Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford]].  Walter seems to have been responsible for building the round tower on the motte for in 1165 it caught fire and a stone tumbling from the battlements killed Earl Roger's last surviving brother [[Mahel de Hereford]].  In September 1233 Walter's grandson, [[Walter de Clifford (died 1263)|Walter de Clifford]] (died 1263), had a force of over 200 men here defending the castle against his father-in-law [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]].  The castle passed from the Cliffords to the Giffards and eventually the de Bohun [[Earl of Hereford|Earls of Hereford]].
[[File:The north view of Brwynllys Castle in the county of Brecknock.jpeg|thumb|North view of the castle in 1740]]

In 1399 Henry IV took possession of all de Bohun property. The castle was additionally fortified against [[Owain Glyndŵr]] during the early years of his rebellion in the early 15th century. Bronllys Castle was never again occupied and by 1583 had fallen into disrepair. A short spell in the possession of the Duke of Buckingham did nothing to improve its state, and in 1521 was once again crown property, where it has remained ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hull |first=Lise |title=Bronllys Castle |url=http://www.castlewales.com/bronllys.html |work=The Castles of Wales |accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now in the care of [[Cadw]], the arm of the Welsh Assembly charged with care of historic monuments and is open to the public between April and October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bronllys Castle |url=http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/bronllys-castle/?lang=en |work=Cadw |publisher=Welsh Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bedo Brwynllys ==

The minor Welsh [[bard]] [[Bedo Brwynllys]] lived in Bronllys in the 15th century. His poetry is characteristic of a follower or imitator of [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]] and is mainly love poetry or religious poetry and some eulogistic poems such as his elegy for [[Sir Richard Herbert]] of Coldbrook, written in 1469.

==Governance==
An [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] in the samed name exists. This ward includes [[Erwood]] and at the 2011 Census had a total population of 1,282.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/bronllys-w05000289#sthash.TEXiNc4D.dpbs|title=Ward population 2011|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ward elects a county councillor to [[Powys County Council]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20613">[[File:Codexaureus 02.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Lorsch Gospels]]. Ivory book cover. Late Antiquity Imperial scenes adapted to a Christian theme.]]
'''Carolingian art''' comes from the [[Frankish Empire]] in the period of roughly 120 years from about 780 to 900—during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] and his immediate heirs—popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The art was produced by and for the court circle and a group of important [[monasteries]] under Imperial patronage; survivals from outside this charmed circle show a considerable drop in quality of workmanship and sophistication of design. The art was produced in several centres in what are now France, Germany, Austria, northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and received considerable influence, via continental mission centres, from the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, as well as a number of Byzantine artists who appear to have been resident in Carolingian centres.

There was for the first time a thoroughgoing attempt in Northern Europe to revive and emulate classical Mediterranean art forms and styles, that resulted in a blending of classical and Northern elements in a sumptuous and dignified style, in particular introducing to the North confidence in representing the human figure, and setting the stage for the rise of [[Romanesque art]] and eventually [[Gothic art]] in the West.  The Carolingian era is part of the period in [[medieval art]] sometimes called the "[[Pre-Romanesque art|Pre-Romanesque]]".  After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new [[Ottonian dynasty]] revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in [[Ottonian art]].

==Overview==
[[File:Musée Picardie Médiéval 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Ivory plaque, probably from a book cover, [[Reims]] late 9th century, with two scenes from the life of [[Saint Remy]] and the Baptism of [[Clovis I|Clovis]]]]
Having established an Empire as large as the [[Byzantine Empire]] of the day, and rivaling in size the old [[Western Roman Empire]], the Carolingian court must have been conscious that they lacked an artistic style to match these or even the post-antique (or "sub-antique" as [[Ernst Kitzinger]] called it)&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 8&lt;/ref&gt; art still being produced in small quantities in [[Rome]] and a few other centres in Italy, which [[Charlemagne]] knew from his campaigns, and where he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in Rome in 800.

As symbolic representative of Rome he sought the ''renovatio'' (revival) of Roman culture and learning in the West, and needed an art capable of telling stories and representing figures with an effectiveness which ornamental Germanic [[Migration period art]] could not.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; He wished to establish himself as the heir to the great rulers of the past, to emulate and symbolically link the artistic achievements of [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] culture with his own.

But it was more than a conscious desire to revive ancient Roman culture. During Charlemagne's reign the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] controversy was dividing the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Charlemagne supported the Western church's consistent refusal to follow iconoclasm; the [[Libri Carolini]] sets out the position of his court circle, no doubt under his direction. With no inhibitions from a cultural memory of Mediterranean pagan [[idolatry]], Charlemagne introduced the first Christian monumental religious sculpture, a momentous precedent for Western art.

Reasonable numbers of Carolingian [[illuminated manuscript]]s and small-scale sculptures, mostly in ivory, have survived, but far fewer examples of metalwork, mosaics and frescoes and other types of work. Many manuscripts in particular are copies or reinterpretations of Late Antique or Byzantine models, nearly all now lost, and the nature of the influence of specific models on individual Carolingian works remains a perennial topic in art history. As well as these influences, the extravagant energy of [[Insular art]] added a definite flavour to Carolingian work, which sometimes used [[interlace (visual arts)|interlacedecoration]], and followed more cautiously the insular freedom in allowing decoration to spread around and into the text on the page of a manuscript.

With the end of Carolingian rule around 900, high quality artistic production greatly declined for about three generations in the Empire. By the later 10th century with the [[Cluny]] reform movement, and a revived spirit for the idea of Empire, art production began again. New Pre-Romanesque styles appeared in Germany with the [[Ottonian art]] of the next stable dynasty, in England with late [[Anglo-Saxon art]], after the threat from the [[Viking]]s was removed, and in Spain.

==Illuminated manuscripts==
[[File:DrogoSacramentaryFol71vAscension.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Drogo Sacramentary]], c. 850: a [[historiated initial]] 'C' contains the [[Ascension of Christ]]. The text is in gold ink.]]
{{See also|Key works of Carolingian illumination}}
The most numerous surviving works of the Carolingian renaissance are [[illuminated manuscripts]]. A number of luxury manuscripts, mostly [[Gospel book]]s, have survived, decorated with a relatively small number of full-page [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], often including [[evangelist portrait]]s, and lavish [[canon tables]], following the precedent of the [[Insular art]] of Britain and Ireland. Narrative images and especially cycles are rarer, but many exist, mostly of the [[Old Testament]], especially [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]; [[New Testament]] scenes are more often found on the ivory [[relief]]s on the covers.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 69. Dodwell, 49 discusses the reasons for this.&lt;/ref&gt; The oversized and heavily decorated initials of Insular art were adopted, and the [[historiated initial]] further developed, with small narrative scenes seen for the first time towards the end of the period—notably in the [[Drogo Sacramentary]]. Luxury manuscripts were given [[treasure binding]]s or rich covers with jewels set in gold and carved ivory panels, and, as in Insular art, were prestige objects kept in the church or treasury, and a different class of object from the working manuscripts kept in the library, where some initials might be decorated, and pen drawings added in a few places. A few of the grandest imperial manuscripts were written on [[purple parchment]]. The [[Bern Physiologus]] is a relatively rare example of a secular manuscript heavily illustrated with fully painted miniatures, lying in between these two classes, and perhaps produced for the private library of an important individual, as was the [[Vatican Terence]]. The [[Utrecht Psalter]], stands alone as a very heavily illustrated library version of the Psalms done in pen and wash, and almost certainly copied from a much earlier manuscript.

Other liturgical works were sometimes produced in luxury manuscripts, such as [[sacramentary|sacramentaries]], but no Carolingian Bible is decorated as heavily as the Late Antique examples that survive in fragments. Teaching books such as theological, historical, literary and scientific works from ancient authors were copied and generally only illustrated in ink, if at all. The [[Chronography of 354]] was a Late Roman manuscript that apparently was copied in the Carolingian period, though this copy seems to have been lost in the 17th century.

===Centres of illumination===
Carolingian manuscripts are presumed to have been produced largely or entirely by clerics, in a few workshops around the Carolingian Empire, each with its own style that developed based on the artists and influences of that particular location and time.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts often have inscriptions, not necessarily contemporary, as to who commissioned them, and which church or monastery they were given to, but few dates or names and locations of those producing them. The surviving manuscripts have been assigned, and often reassigned, to workshops by scholars, and the controversies attending this process have largely died down. The earliest workshop was the Court School of Charlemagne; then a [[Rheims]]ian style, which became the most influential of the Carolingian period; a Touronian style; a Drogo style; and finally a Court School of Charles the Bald. These are the major centres, but others exist, characterized by the works of art produced there.

[[File:Ebbo Gospels St Mark.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Mark]] from the [[Ebbo Gospels]]]]

The Court School of Charlemagne (also known as the '''Ada School''') produced the earliest manuscripts, including the [[Godescalc Evangelistary]] (781–783); the [[Codex Aureus of Lorsch|Lorsch Gospels]] (778–820); the [[Ada Gospels]]; the [[Soissons Gospels]]; the [[Harley Golden Gospels]] (800-820);  and the [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]]; ten manuscripts in total are usually recognised. The Court School manuscripts were ornate and ostentatious, and reminiscent of 6th-century ivories and mosaics from [[Ravenna]], Italy. They were the earliest Carolingian manuscripts and initiated a revival of Roman classicism, yet still maintained [[Migration Period art]] (Merovingian and [[Insular art|Insular]]) traditions in their basically linear presentation, with no concern for volume and spatial relationships.

In the early 9th-century Archbishop [[Ebo of Rheims]], at [[Hautvillers]] (near [[Rheims]]), assembled artists and transformed Carolingian art to something entirely new. The [[Gospel book of Ebbo]] (816–835) was painted with swift, fresh and vibrant brush strokes, evoking an inspiration and energy unknown in classical Mediterranean forms. Other books associated with the Rheims school include the [[Utrecht Psalter]], which was perhaps the most important of all Carolingian manuscripts, and the ''[[Bern Physiologus]]'', the earliest Latin edition of the Christian [[Medieval allegory|allegorical]] text on animals. The expressive animations of the Rheims school, in particular the Utrecht Psalter with its naturalistic expressive figurine line drawings, would have influence on northern medieval art for centuries to follow, into the Romanesque period.

Another style developed at the monastery of [[St Martin of Tours]], in which large Bibles were illustrated based on Late Antique bible illustrations. Three large Touronian Bibles were created, the last, and best, example was made about 845/846 for [[Charles the Bald]], called the [[Vivian Bible]]. The [[Tours]] School was cut short by the invasion of the [[Normans]] in 853, but its style had already left a permanent mark on other centers in the Carolingian Empire.

[[File:Utrecht 15v 2.jpg|right|thumb|From the [[Utrecht Psalter]], 9th-century Naturalistic and energetic figurine line drawings were entirely new, and were to become the most influential innovation of Carolinian art in later periods.]]

The [[diocese of Metz]] was another center of Carolingian art. Between 850 and 855 a [[sacramentary]] was made for Bishop [[Drogo of Metz|Drogo]] called the [[Drogo Sacramentary]]. The illuminated "historiated" decorated initials (see image this page) were to have influence into the Romanesque period and were a harmonious union of classical lettering with figural scenes.

In the second half of the 9th century the traditions of the first half continued. A number of richly decorated Bibles were made for Charles the Bald, fusing Late Antiquity forms with the styles developed at Rheims and Tours. It was during this time a [[Franco-Saxon]] style appeared in the north of France, integrating Hiberno-Saxon interlace, and would outlast all other Carolingian styles into the next century.

Charles the Bald, like his grandfather, also established a Court School. Its location is uncertain but several manuscripts are attributed to it, with the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]] (870) being the last and most spectacular. It contained Touronian and Rheimsian elements, but fused with the style that characterized Charlemagne's Court School more formal manuscripts.

With the death of Charles the Bald patronage for manuscripts declined, signaling the beginning of the end, but some work did continue for a while. The [[Abbey of St. Gall]] created the [[Folchard Psalter]] (872) and the [[Golden Psalter]] (883). This Gallish style was unique, but lacked the level of technical mastery seen in other regions.

==Sculpture and metalwork==
[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|left|Gem-encrusted cover of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], 870]]

Luxury Carolingian manuscripts were intended to have [[treasure binding]]s—ornate covers in precious metal set with jewels around central carved ivory panels—sometimes these were donated some time after the manuscript itself was produced. Only a few such covers have survived intact, but many of the ivory panels survive detached, where the covers have been broken up for their materials. The subjects were often narrative religious scenes in vertical sections, largely derived from Late Antique paintings and carvings, as were those with more hieratic images derived from [[consular diptych]]s and other imperial art, such as the front and back covers of the [[Lorsch Gospels]], which adapt a 6th-century Imperial triumph to the triumph of Christ and the Virgin.

Important Carolingian examples of goldsmith's work include the upper cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]]; the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], which can be precisely dated to 870, is probably a product of the same workshop, though there are differences of style. This workshop is associated with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles the Bald|Charles II (the Bald)]], and often called his "Palace School". Its location (if it had a fixed one) remains uncertain and much discussed, but [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis Abbey]] outside Paris is one leading possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 60–68&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arnulf Ciborium]] (a miniature [[ciborium (architecture)|architectural ciborium]] rather than the [[Ciborium (container)|vessel for hosts]]), now in the [[Munich Residenz]], is the third major work in the group; all three have fine relief figures in [[repoussé]] gold. Another work associated with the workshop is the frame of an antique [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] dish in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 64-65, 66-67; [[:File:Serpentine paten Louvre MR415.jpg|picture of the dish]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholars tend to group the Lindau Gospels and the Arnulf Ciborium in closer relation to each other than the Codex Aureus to either.

Charlemagne revived large-scale bronze casting when he created a foundry at [[Aachen]] which cast the doors for his [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|palace chapel]], in imitation of Roman designs. The chapel also had a now lost life-size crucifix, with the figure of Christ in gold, the first known work of this type, which was to become so important a feature of medieval church art. Probably a wooden figure was mechanically [[gilding|gilded]], as with the Ottonian [[Golden Madonna of Essen]].

One of the finest examples of Carolingian goldsmiths' work is the Golden Altar (824–859), a ''[[paliotto]]'', in the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in [[Milan]]. The altars four sides are decorated with images in gold and silver [[repoussé]], framed by borders of [[filigree]], precious stones and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]].

The [[Lothair Crystal]], of the middle of the 9th century, is one of the largest of a group of about 20 engraved pieces of [[rock crystal]] which survive; this shows large numbers of figures in several scenes showing the unusual subject of the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Suzanna]].

==Mosaics and frescos==
[[File:Germigny Des Pres 2007 01.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], [[Germigny-des-Prés]], c. 806, but restored. The subject seems drawn from illuminated Jewish bibles, and relates to the [[Libri Carolini]], possibly written by Theodulf, where the Ark is cited as divine approval of sacred images.]]
Sources attest to the abundance of wall paintings seen in churches and palaces, most of which have not survived. Records of [[Titulus (inscription)|inscriptions]] show that their subject matter was primarily religious.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mosaic]]s installed in [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Charlemagne's palatine chapel]] showed an enthroned Christ worshipped by the [[Evangelist's symbol]]s and the twenty-four elders from the [[Apocalypse]]. This mosaic no longer survives, but an over-restored one remains in the [[apse]] of the [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] at [[Germigny-des-Prés]] (806) which shows the [[Ark of the Covenant]] adored by angels, discovered in 1820 under a coat of plaster.

The villa to which the oratory was attached belonged to a key associate of Charlemagne, Bishop [[Theodulf of Orléans]]. It was destroyed later in the century, but had [[fresco]]s of the [[Seven liberal arts]], the [[season|Four Seasons]], and the [[Mappa Mundi]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 13–17&lt;/ref&gt; We know from written sources of other [[fresco]]s in churches and palaces, nearly all completely lost. Charlemagne's Aachen palace contained a wall painting of the [[Liberal Arts]], as well as narrative scenes from his war in Spain. The palace of [[Louis the Pious]] at [[Ingelheim]] contained historical images from antiquity to the time of Charlemagne, and the palace church contained [[Typology (theology)|typological]] scenes of the Old and New Testaments juxtaposed with one another.

Fragmentary paintings have survived at [[Auxerre]], [[Coblenz]], [[Lorsch]], [[Cologne]], [[Fulda]], [[Corvey]], [[Trier]], [[Müstair]], [[Mals]], [[Naturns]], [[Cividale]], [[Brescia]] and [[Milan]].

==Spolia==
[[File:Codexaureus 25.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lorsch Gospels]] 778–820. Charlemagne's Court School.]]
[[File:Lothair Crystal AD 855-869 (Carolingian Empire).jpg|thumb|The [[Lothair Crystal]], mid-9th century]]
''[[Spolia]]'' is the Latin term for "spoils" and is used to refer to the taking or appropriation of ancient monumental or other art works for new uses or locations. We know that many marbles and columns were brought from Rome northward during this period.

Perhaps the most famous example of Carolingian spolia is the tale of an equestrian statue. In Rome, Charlemagne had seen the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Lateran Palace]]. It was the only surviving statue of a pre-Christian Roman Emperor because it was mistakenly thought, at the time, to be that of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] and thus held great accord—Charlemagne thus brought an equestrian statue from [[Ravenna]], then believed to be that of [[Theodoric the Great]], to Aachen, to match the statue of "Constantine" in Rome.

Antique [[carved gems]] were reused in various settings, without much regard to their original [[iconography]].

[[File:Charles Eamer Kempe, 1860.jpg|thumb|upright|Kempe in 1860]]

'''Charles Eamer Kempe''' (29 June 1837 – 29 April 1907) was a Victorian designer and manufacturer of [[stained glass]]. His studios produced over 4,000 windows and also designs for altars and altar frontals, furniture and furnishings, lichgates and memorials that helped to define a later nineteenth-century Anglican style. The list of English cathedrals containing examples of his work includes: [[Chester Cathedral|Chester]], [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]], [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]], [[Lichfield Cathedral|Lichfield]], [[Wells Cathedral|Wells]], [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] and [[York Minster|York]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:York Minster - RWB Hornby Window.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert William Bilton Hornby|R.W.B. Hornby]] memorial window at York Minster]]
Charles Kempe was born at Ovingdean Hall, near [[Brighton]], [[East Sussex]] in 1837. He was the youngest son of Nathaniel Kemp, a cousin of [[Thomas Read Kemp]], a politician and property developer responsible for the [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]] area of Brighton&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Kempe added the ‘e’ to his name in adult life&lt;/ref&gt; and the maternal grandson of Sir [[John Eamer]], who served as [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1801.

After attending [[Twyford School]], he attended [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] where he was influenced by the [[Oxford Movement|Anglo-Catholic Tractarian]] revival and considered a vocation to the priesthood. When it became clear that his severe [[stammer]] would be an impediment to preaching Kempe decided that "if I was not permitted to minister in the Sanctuary I would use my talents to adorn it", and subsequently went to study [[architecture]] with the firm of a leading ecclesiastical architect [[George Frederick Bodley]], where he learned the aesthetic principles of medieval church art, particularly stained glass. During the 1860s Kempe collaborated with Bodley on the internal painting of two churches, [[All Saints Church, Cambridge|All Saints, Jesus Lane]] in [[Cambridge]] and [[Church of Saint John the Baptist, Liverpool|St John’s]], [[Tuebrook]] in [[Liverpool]]. Later, in 1892, Bodley and Kempe would work together once more on All Saints at [[Danehill, East Sussex|Danehill]], [[East Sussex]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Kempe Studios ==
[[File:Kempe maker's mark.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Kempe company maker's mark, the Wheatsheaf, on a window in [[St Mary's Church, Nottingham]]]]
In 1866 he opened a studio of his own in [[London]], supplying and creating stained glass and furnishings and [[vestment]]s. The firm prospered and by 1899 he had over fifty employees. As a [[trademark]], the firm used a golden ''garb'' or wheatsheaf, taken from Kempe's own [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LlQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA471&amp;lpg=PA471&amp;dq=%22garb%20or%22|title=The baronetage of England, or, The history of the English baronets, and such baronets of Scotland, as are of English families|first=rev William|last=Betham|date=1 January 1801|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-Victorian period were important years in the history of the design of English churches and Kempe’s influence is found in numerous examples, many in his home county of Sussex which has 116 examples of his work.&lt;ref&gt;The Corpus of Kempe Stained Glass, editor Philip N.H. Collins, The Kempe Trust, 2000,&lt;/ref&gt; The works at St Mark’s, [[Staplefield]] near [[Horsham]], [[West Sussex]] dating from 1869 are regarded as especially important, representing the earliest of three known examples of Kempe’s wall painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://southdownsliving.blogspot.com/2010/04/kempe-wall-paintings-st-marks-church.html Information on Kempe wall paintings at St Mark’s,  Staplefield&lt;/ref&gt; They contain key elements of Kempe’s figurative work. The angels holding the scroll are magnificently apparelled and the borders of their cloaks are embellished with pearls, each individually highlighted although they do not contain a design of peacock feathers, a well used embellishment in later works. [[Rosalie Glynn Grylls]], [[Mander family|Lady Mander]], whose home [[Wightwick Manor]], near [[Wolverhampton]], contains many pieces of Kempe's stained glass, wrote in 1973:
"Kempe's work has a unique charm; its colours shine out from jewels that cluster on the [[mitre]]s or the [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] his figures wear and from their [[peacock]]s' feathers, while [[angel]]s playing their instruments are drawn with tender delicacy and scattered above the main windows informally but making a pattern of precision. Above all, the prevailing yellow wash is literally translucent, for it lets through the rays of the full or the setting sun..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owlpen.com/wightwick.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322231351/http://www.owlpen.com/wightwick.shtml |archivedate=22 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Information on Wightwick Manor&lt;/ref&gt;

On Kempe’s death in 1907 in accordance with his will the firm was reformed as C. E Kempe &amp; Co. Ltd and Kempe's distant cousin, Walter Earnest Tower (1873–1955), was appointed Chairman. Tower thenceforth used a black tower above the golden garb. A lack of orders caused by the [[Great Depression]] ended the firm's life in 1934.

==Personal life==
Kempe was a rather shy person, who never married. He continued to live in Sussex most of his life and in 1875 he bought and renovated an Elizabethan House at [[Lindfield, West Sussex|Lindfield]], near [[Haywards Heath]] in West Sussex. Kempe would entertain his clients and professional colleagues from his home enjoying the role of a country squire.

Kempe died suddenly on 28 April 1907 aged 69, at 28 Nottingham Place, London, having caught a cold that led to congestion of the lung and refused to get medical help. He 
is buried in the churchyard at [[St Wulfran's Church, Ovingdean]].&lt;ref name="Dale207"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |page=207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, most of Kempe's records were disposed of after the firm shut in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;M.

'''''Chief Culture Officer''''' (2009) is the eighth book by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[author]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Grant McCracken]].&lt;ref name=PsychologyToday&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology Today Profile|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/grant-mccracken-phd|publisher=[[Psychology Today]]|date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book looks at how modern business attempt to connect with culture.  In the author's analysis he considers examples such as [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty|Dove's campaign for real beauty]], and the [[I Love New York]] advertising campaign.

According to McCracken, the book is about highlighting the importance of modern culture for businesses, and in doing so, to create a position within them for a "person who knows culture, both its fads and fashions, and its deep, enduring structures": a Chief Culture Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.2 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

In the book, McCracken recounts how corporations that successfully adapt to the cultural changes tend to prosper.  His definition of [[culture]] begins with a distinction between fast and slow:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Fast culture is like all the boats on the surface of the Pacific.  We can spot them, track them.  Slow culture is everything beneath the surface: less well charted, much less visible"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.44 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

McCracken argues that when fast and slow culture meet, a convergent culture is created. He points to the [[preppy]] subculture as an example of a convergent culture that brands such as [[Ralph Lauren]] and [[Tommy Hilfiger]] have capitalized on. He also analyses the convergence of [[Social status|status]], shifting from a class based value system to celebrity, and the [[cool (aesthetic)|cool]] convergence, an aesthetic that he states developed alongside the [[baby boomer]] generation.

Changing relationships, McCracken argues, between consumers and producers have created new opportunities for brands to connect with culture. He observes that whilst only [[1% rule (Internet culture)|1 in 100]] people create content on the Internet, the creator consumer dynamic used to be "1 in 10,000".  McCracken believes this change allows consumers to become an "active participant in the branding process". He refers to [[converse (shoe company)|Converse's]] 2005 motto as an illustration of this change: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We don't own the brand.  Consumers do"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.90 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For business's attempting to closely monitor culture, McCracken advises against employing "cool hunters" who "know only what suits them."  Instead, he recommends creating a position for a Chief Culture Officer who is aware of both fast and slow culture, a "creature of many worlds, captives of none."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.190 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

[[Harvard Business Review]] recommended the book in their 2010 magazine, stating "a CCO is necessary for any competitive, consumer-oriented company".&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;Bell, Catherine.

'''''Clinton v. City of New York''''', 524 U.S. 417 (1998), is a [[legal case]] in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the [[line-item veto]] as granted in the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]] violated the [[Presentment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] because it impermissibly gave the [[President of the United States]] the power to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of [[statute]]s that had been duly passed by the [[United States Congress]]. The decision of the Court, in a six-to-three majority, was delivered by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]].

==Background of the case==
The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 allowed the [[President of the United States|president]] to "cancel", that is to void or legally nullify, certain provisions of [[Appropriation (law)|appropriations]] bills, and disallowed the use of funds from canceled provisions for offsetting [[deficit spending]] in other areas.

===Political circumstances===
The 1994 federal [[midterm elections]] signaled a sea-change in [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] known as the [[Republican Revolution]], with the Republican Party taking control of both houses of the U.S. Congress from Democrats. Key to that revolution was the Republicans' [[Contract with America]], which included a list of actions they promised to take if they gained control of Congress. Among this list was the Line Item Veto Act itself, one of two provisions designed to ensure congressional fiscal conservatism. The Act was the only provision of the "Contract with America" that [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Initial litigation===
At its passage, the Act was politically controversial, with many Democrats breaking with Clinton to oppose it. Of the opposition, six members of Congress, including Republican [[Mark Hatfield]], sued to prevent use of the line-item veto. They were granted [[summary judgment]] by the U.S. District Court, but the Supreme Court held that the Congressmen lacked [[Standing (law)|standing]] because they could not show any particularized harm, and dismissed their suit in ''[[Raines v. Byrd]]'', 521 U.S. 811 (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

  |date = 1997
  |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-1671.ZS.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the next two months, Clinton began using the line-item veto, prompting several entities to file suit in a second attempt to have the Act declared [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

In the second case, which was consolidated from two cases by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]], the [[New York City|City of New York]] and several organizations related to [[health care]] alleged injury from President Clinton's cancellation of certain provisions of the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]] that eliminated certain liabilities, and Snake River Potato Growers, Inc. alleged injury from the President's cancellation of certain provisions of the [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]] that gave [[tax]] benefits to aid farmer's [[cooperative]]s in purchasing potato processing facilities.

The District Court ruled for the plaintiffs, holding that the Line Item Veto Act was unconstitutional. Because the Act established an expedited appeal process for challenges, the case was directly appealed from the District Court to the Supreme Court.

==The Supreme Court's decision==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2017}}
In a majority opinion written by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], the Court ruled that because the Act allowed the President to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of duly enacted [[statute]]s by using line-item cancellations, it violated the [[Presentment Clause]] of the Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution|U.S. Const. art. I]], § 7, cl. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines a specific practice for enacting a statute. The Court construed the silence of the Constitution on the subject of such unilateral Presidential action as equivalent to "an express prohibition", agreeing with historical material that supported the conclusion that statutes may only be enacted "in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
  |litigants = INS v. Chadha
  |vol = 462
  |reporter = U.S.
  |opinion = 919
  |date = 1983
  |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a bill must be approved or rejected by the President in its entirety.

===Kennedy's concurrence===
Justice [[Anthony M. Kennedy]], in an [[concurring opinion|opinion concurring]] in the opinion and judgment of the Court, objected to the dissent's argument that the Act did not violate principles of the [[separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] and threaten individual [[liberty]], stating that the "undeniable effects" of the Act were to "enhance the President's power to reward one group and punish another, to help one set of taxpayers and hurt another, to favor one State and ignore another". Kennedy's concurrence implicitly viewed the statute as a violation of the [[nondelegation doctrine]].

===Breyer's dissent===
In a [[dissenting opinion]], Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] contended that the objective of the Act was constitutionally proper and was consistent with powers that the President has held in the past, stating that the Act "does not violate any specific textual constitutional command, nor does it violate any implicit Separation of Powers principle". He extensively refers to many different cases which support the delegation of power by [[United States Congress|the Congress]], and primarily suggests that the Act is an efficient means by which a constitutionally legitimate end may be achieved.

===Scalia's partial concurrence and partial dissent===
In an alternative opinion, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] objected to the Court's consideration of the case with respect to the Taxpayer Relief Act, finding no party in the case with [[standing (law)|standing]] to challenge it. However, he did find a party with standing to challenge the President's cancellation in the Balanced Budget Act, and concluded that it did not violate the Constitution, because the Congress has the power to delegate the discretionary authority to decline to spend appropriated sums of money, which he asserted was equivalent to cancellation.

==Critical response==

Michael B. Rappaport argued that the original meaning of the Constitution does not apply to certain parts of the [[nondelegation doctrine]], relying on his interpretation of the Executive Power Vesting Clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In Rappaport’s opinion, "the Court’s approach to cancellation authority has no basis in text, structure and purpose, or precedent".&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport at 290.&lt;/ref&gt;
J.Stephen Kennedy wrote that the majority of the Supreme Court was sufficiently concerned with the constitutional challenges to the line item veto presented to declare the act wholly unconstitutional, instead of relying on other traditional and less sweeping ways of correcting acts of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

First, it suggests that the Court seems unready or unwilling to alter the existing interpretation of the nondelegation doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Huefner at 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Court has shown that it is willing to rely upon alternative rationales to achieve the same result "as would a more robust nondelegation doctrine rationale".&lt;ref name=Huefner /&gt; This approach is significant because in theory, such a rationale could endanger previously accepted delegations to the executive.&lt;ref name=Huefner /&gt;

Roy E. Brownell II criticized the Clinton administration for its exercise of the Line Item Veto Act, charging that it should have restricted its cancellation powers only to statutory provisions that remain in the realm of national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Brownell suggested that a [[test case]] brought forth on the grounds of national security would have likely acknowledged the existence of "[[National Security Rescission]]", "a narrow [[Statutory interpretation|statutory construction]] limiting the area of presidential cancellation power to within the field of national security. Such a result ... would have assured that the President maintained cancellation authority over a sixth of the federal budget."&lt;ref&gt;Brownell at 1280.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven G. Calabresi]] argued that although the Court had denied this, the instant decision was really a "[[Nondelegation doctrine]] case masquerading as a [[bicameralism]] and [[Presentment Clause|presentment case]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Subsequent developments==
Though the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto Act in 1998, President [[George W. Bush]] asked Congress to enact legislation that would return the line item veto power to the Executive. First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006 [[State of the Union address]], President Bush sent a legislative proposal [[Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006]] to Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pubpress/2006/line_item_veto.pdf |title=Proposal for a Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 |access-date=2006-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060610203926/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pubpress/2006/line_item_veto.pdf |archive-date=2006-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Bill Frist]], Senator [[John McCain]], and Republican Whip Senator [[Mitch McConnell]] jointly introduced this proposal.

On that same day, [[Joshua Bolten]], the Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]], gave a press conference on the president's line-item veto proposal. Bolten explained that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out "wasteful" spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to rescind the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a [[majority|simple majority]]. Additionally, such proposals could not be [[filibuster]]ed.

When asked how this proposed legislation was different from the 1996 Line Item Veto Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, in order for the President to successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.

Though the newer line-item veto proposal was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless failed to find strong support in Congress. Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]] of [[West Virginia]] called it "an offensive slap at Congress", asserting that the legislation would enable the president to intimidate individual members of Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that the line-item veto as proposed would take away Congress' constitutional "[[power of the purse]]" and give it to the [[executive branch]].

On June 8, 2006, [[Viet D. Dinh]], Professor of Law at [[Georgetown University Law Center]], and [[Nathan Sales]], John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center testified by written statement before the [[House Committee on the Budget]] on the constitutional issues in connection with the proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budget.house.gov/hearings/dinhstmnt060806.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628191259/http://www.budget.house.gov/hearings/dinhstmnt060806.htm |archivedate=2006-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution's [[Bicameralism]] and [[Presentment Clause]], and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.

The proposed Act was approved by the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Budget Committee]] on June 14, 2006 by a vote of 24–9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23815">'''Consular nonreviewability''' (sometimes written as '''consular non-reviewability''', and also called '''consular absolutism''') refers to the doctrine in immigration law in the [[United States]] where the [[Visa (document)|visa]] decisions made by United States [[consul (representative)|consular officers]] ([[Foreign Service Officers]] working for the [[United States Department of State]]) cannot be appealed in the United States judicial system. It is closely related to the [[plenary power]] doctrine that immunizes from judicial review the substantive immigration decisions of the [[United States Congress]] and the executive branch of the United States government.&lt;ref name=scotus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/02/argument-preview-the-doctrine-of-consular-non-reviewability-historical-relic-or-good-law/|title = Argument preview: The doctrine of consular non-reviewability – historical relic or good law?|last = Johnson|first = Kevin|date = February 18, 2015|accessdate = September 29, 2015|publisher = SCOTUSblog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dobkin&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.law.yale.edu/system/files/area/conference/ilroundtable/ILR13_DIDonaldDobkinChallengingtheDoctrine.pdf|title = Challenging the Doctrine of Consular Non-Reviewability in Immigration Cases|last = Dobkin|first = Donald|accessdate = January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the alien denied entry at a consulate abroad was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, it is not ''a priori'' clear whether the alien has [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue in the US justice system. However, the principle of consular nonreviewability goes further than simply denying aliens standing; it also creates a strong presumption against judicial review of consular decisions requested by United States citizens and residents affected by them.&lt;ref name=dobkin/&gt;

== Distinction between Department of State decisions, USCIS decisions, and ICE/CBP immigration enforcement decisions ==

Consular nonreviewability specifically applies to decisions made by consular officers representing the United States in other countries, who are employees of the [[United States Department of State]]. It does not apply to decisions made by [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]].

For many immigrant and non-immigrant visas, the approval of a petition or application from the USCIS is a prerequisite for obtaining the visa. However, the visa may be denied despite the USCIS application having been approved, and consular nonreviewability insulates such decisions from challenge.&lt;ref name=dobkin/&gt; For instance, in the case of ''[[Kerry v. Din]]'' (2015) the applicant whose visa was denied had gotten USCIS approval through a [[Form I-130]] filed by his wife, but his visa was nonetheless denied and the United States government claimed that detailed explanation of the reason of denial was not necessary.

Consular nonreviewability also does not apply to decisions made by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers when deciding whether to allow an alien to enter or not enter the United States at a designated port of entry, or to immigration enforcement actions taken by [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]. However, in practice, the avenues of legal redress for the actions of these agencies are limited, owing to the [[plenary power]] doctrine.

== Review and reconsideration within the Department of State ==

Consular nonreviewability does not mean that the Department of State cannot reconsider its immigration decisions. There are a number of avenues for redress within the Department of State for somebody whose visa is denied.&lt;ref name=lawandborder&gt;{{cite web|url = http://lawandborder.com/options-after-a-consular-officer-denies-your-visa-application/|title = Options after a Consular Officer Denies Your U.S. Visa Application|accessdate = October 22, 2015|publisher = U.S. &amp; China Visa Law Blog|last = Chodorow|first = Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Re-application and submission of additional information ===

* '''Section 214(b) refusals''': These are refusals for non-immigrant visas where the consular officer is unconvinced of the applicant's non-immigrant intent. This ground of refusal cannot be appealed, but the applicant is free to apply again for a visa (paying the visa fee again). Past refusals are on the record and the applicant is therefore in principle expected to show a change in circumstances to explain why he/she would now qualify for a visa. However, since different consular officers make decisions based on their own discretion the applicant may well qualify when applying the second time despite no change to circumstances.
* '''Section 221(g) refusals''': These "quasi-refusals" mean that the consular officer has deferred a final decision on the applicant, and will complete the decision once additional information from the applicant or the United States government becomes available. If the pending information needs to come from the applicant, there is a time limit of one year. If the applicant exceeds the time limit, the applicant needs to re-apply. If the pending information needs to come from the United States government, there is no time limit. The various grounds for such quasi-refusals:
** Suspension of Action on Petition
** Addition evidence is required
** Withdrawal of application (while it is pending adjudication)

=== Supervisorial review ===

The [[Code of Federal Regulations]] states that all non-immigrant visa denials should be reviewed by a supervisor. However, the [[Foreign Affairs Manual]] states that as many refusals as practical, but not fewer than 20%, should be reviewed, as soon as possible, but deferrable by up to 120 days if the applicant wishes to submit additional evidence. For immigrant visa applications, the review must take place as soon as administratively feasible (but within 30 days) unless the applicant wishes to submit additional evidence (in which case there is no time limit). Supervisorial review of 214(b) refusals (failure to establish non-immigrant intent) require the supervisor to re-interview the applicant.&lt;ref name=lawandborder/&gt;

=== It may be possible to appeal a decision within a consulate ===

In some limited circumstances, the decisions of consular officers may be appealed within the consulate. However, there are no procedural guarantees of this.

== Scope and exceptions ==

A few exceptions to the doctrine of consular nonreviewability have emerged over the years:&lt;ref name=dobkin/&gt;&lt;ref name=americanbar/&gt;

# The ''Mandel'' test, namely, that the consulate did not provide a "facially legitimate and bona fide" reason for the rejection, and it might infringe on the constitutional rights of United States citizens.
# In cases where a consular officer rejects the application based on an underlying statute or regulation, it may sometimes be appealed on these two grounds:
#* Claims that the underlying statute or regulation being applied is unconstitutional.
#* Claims that the consular officer made a procedural error in applying the statute.

== History ==

Since it almost by definition excludes judicial review, cases challenging the doctrine of consular nonreviewability are heard quite rarely in court. However, the doctrine has evolved somewhat in response to court challenges.&lt;ref name=dobkin/&gt;&lt;ref name=americanbar&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/BriefsV4/13-1402_amicus_resp_lawprofs.authcheckdam.pdf|title = Brief of ''Amicus Curiae'' Law Professors in Support of Respondent (Kerry v. Din)|publisher = [[American Bar Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-Chinese Exclusion Act: The Chinese Exclusion Case (1889) ===

{{further|Chae Chan Ping v. United States}}

Some important precedents regarding judicial reviewability of immigration decisions were set in the aftermath of the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and [[Immigration Act of 1882]]. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first federal immigration act to significantly affect migration flows, and the Immigration Act of 1882 gave enforcement teeth to this law by making immigration enforcement a federal matter. At this time, the determination regarding whether an alien could enter the United States was by the officer at the designated port of entry. When the officer decided not to admit the alien, the alien was generally detained on the vessel he or she had arrived on and then returned to his or her home country by the captain of the vessel. Since the vessel would generally be harbored in the United States prior to departure, the alien could file a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and have his or her refusal challenged in court, at least in principle. A few such cases shortly after the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act helped delineate the scope of judicial review for decisions on whether to admit an alien.

The most significant case was ''[[Chae Chan Ping v. United States]]'' (1889), also called the Chinese Exclusion Case. Chae Chan Ping, a Chinese-born United States resident was denied re-entry to the United States after a trip to China, in accordance with the [[Scott Act (1888)|Scott Act]], which had passed after his departure to China but prior to his return arrival. He filed a lawsuit against the United States government, and lost. In its decision, the Supreme Court wrote that the power to exclude foreigners rested with the executive branch of the government, and any international grievances arising from this were the province of the political department of the government.

Other cases that occurred in subsequent years further strengthened the plenary power doctrine, though they related to the authority to deny entry and deport people and did not address consular decisions. These included ''[[Fong Yue Ting v. United States]]'' (1893), ''[[Lem Moon Sing v. United States]]'' (1895), and ''[[United States v. Ju Toy]]'' (1905).

===Post-Immigration Act of 1924: ''London v. Phelps'' (1927) and ''Ulrich v. Kellogg'' (1929) ===

Prior to [[World War I]], [[passport]]s and [[Visa (document)|visas]] were not necessary to enter the United States at a designated port of entry. In 1917 (during World War I), the [[United States Department of State]] and [[United States Department of Labor]] issued a joint order to diplomatic, consular, and immigration officers requiring that noncitizens have a passport and visa before seeking entry to the United States.&lt;ref name=americanbar/&gt; In 1918, these requirements were made long-term by the United States Congress. Initially, consular officers issuing visas did not check for grounds of inadmissibility; rather, they simply issued the visa and informed the applicant of potential grounds for inadmissibility, leaving the task of determining inadmissibility to the officer at the port of entry.&lt;ref name=americanbar/&gt; This led to the problem of people undertaking an expensive journey and then being rejected at the port of entry. In 1924, Congress enacted a provision requiring consular officers to make a determination of admissibility and issue the visa only if they were satisfied.&lt;ref name=americanbar/&gt; While the officer at the border still had final say on whether to admit the alien (i.e., the alien could be denied entry despite having a valid visa), the visa served an important prior screening and filtering role.

At the same time, the United States moved in the direction of more comprehensive restrictions on immigration from around the world. Specifically, the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 restricted annual immigration from a country to no more than 3% of the population of people from that country in the United States as of the [[U.S. Census of 1910]]; the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] (The Johnson-Reed Act) further reduced this to 2%. While this effectively limited immigration from most countries to lower than the levels at that time, the primary purpose of the law was to clamp down on immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. It also significantly affected immigration from Africa and Asia.

The combination of the increased degree of immigration restriction and the shifting of immigration decisions towards consulates abroad gave consular decisions considerable significance.

Two cases in the immediate aftermath of the Immigration Act of 1924 have been cited as precedents for consular nonreviewability:

* ''United States ex rel. London v. Phelps'' 22 F. 2d 288 (2d Cir. 1927): Mrs. London, who lived in [[Canada]], requested a visa to visit her children in [[New York City]]. Her visa was denied. She appeared at the border where she was refused entry. She filed a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' petition against the U.S. immigration inspector, arguing that as a resident of Canada she was not required to have a visa to travel to the United States. She also argued that the issuance of visas was simply a ministerial act, and therefore the decision not to grant her a visa was wrong as well. The case was decided against Mrs. London. The ''Phelps'' court's decision noted that "Unjustifiable refusal to vise a passport [...] is beyond the jurisdiction of the court." While the case has been cited as a precedent for consular nonreviewability,&lt;ref name=dobkin/&gt; some have argued that it addressed only the question of what was relevant to that particular court case.&lt;ref name=americanbar/&gt;
* ''United States ex rel. Ulrich v. Kellogg'' 30 F. 2d 984, 985 (D.C. Cir. 1929): The petitioner, a U.S. citizen, filed a petition for writ of [[mandamus]] asking the court to order the U.S. consulate in [[Berlin]] to issue a visa to his wife in Germany. The consulate had refused to issue her a visa based on the claim that she had previously committed [[larceny]], considered a [[moral turpitude|crime of moral turpitude]]. The court reviewed the decision and found that the conviction for larceny constituted a crime of moral turpitude, and therefore made her inadmissible. It further noted that, both{{clarify|date=February 2017}} on the language of the relevant statutes, the power to issue or deny visas lay with consular officers, not with the Secretary of State, and therefore the Secretary of State could not order a consular officer to change a visa decision.

=== The Administrative Procedure Act (1946), ''Knauff v. Shaughnessy'' (1950), and reliance on the plenary power doctrine ===

Prior to 1946, there was no barrier in principle to judicial review of consular decisions, but there was no clear protocol in general for challenging decisions by government agencies in courts. The [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] of 1946 changed this; Section 10 of the APA permitted judicial review for any person "adversely affected or aggrieved" by the actions of a government agency.&lt;ref name=americanbar/&gt; Also, Section 279 of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] explicitly gave the courts jurisdiction over "all causes" arising under Title II of the statute. This meant that cases would be brought to the courts the decisions on which would help clarify their thinking on consular nonreviewability.

Courts' initial response to efforts to challenge consular decisions was to rely on the [[plenary power]] doctrine. The first decision establishing the plenary power doctrine in the post-APA era was ''[[Knauff v. Shaughnessy]]'' (1950). According to the ''Knauff'' court, "whatever the procedure authorized by Congress, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned."&lt;ref name=scotus/&gt;&lt;ref name=dobkin/&gt;

In this case, Knauff, the alien wife of a citizen who had served for the United States in [[World War II]] sought admission to the United States (and would ordinarily have been eligible based on the [[War Brides Act]]), but was denied admission by the United States based on confidential information. The Attorney General denied a hearing, arguing that a hearing would reveal sensitive information that would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The Supreme Court upheld the Attorney General's decision, clarifying that the denial of entry to the alien wife was not unconstitutional, and that it is "not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by law, to review the determination of the political branch of Government to exclude a certain alien."&lt;ref name=justia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/338/537/|title = Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537 (1950)|publisher = [[Justia]]|accessdate = September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other court decisions at the time played some role in establishing the doctrine of consular nonreviewability:&lt;ref name=americanbar/&gt;

* ''[[Licea-Gomez v. Pilliod]]'', 193 F. Supp. 577 (N.D. Ill. 1960): The petitioner was excluded for lacking a visa, and filed a complaint under the APA challenging both the exclusion order and the consular officer's refusal to issue a visa. The court acknowledged that the petitioner could challenge the exclusion under the APA, but declined to consider the arguments relating to the denial of the visa.
* ''[[Loza-Bedoya v. INS]]'', 410 F.2d 343 (9th Cir. 1969): The INS had incorrectly informed the U.S. consulate that Loza-Bedoya had been involved with criminal activity, and the consulate denied a visa based on that. He, however, re-entered the United States without inspection and was later placed in deportation proceedings. He filed a motion with the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] to reopen, but was denied, and he challenged this in court, but the court sided with the BIA.

=== ''Kleindienst v. Mandel'' (1972) ===

''[[Kleindienst v. Mandel]]'', 408 U.S 753 (172) was a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that upheld that the [[United States Attorney General]] has the right to refuse somebody's entry to the [[United States]], as he has been empowered to do so in 212 (a) (28) of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]].

This action was brought to compel Attorney General Kleindienst to grant a temporary nonimmigrant visa to a [[Belgium|Belgian]] journalist and [[Marxism|Marxian]] theoretician whom the American plaintiff-appellees, [[Ernest Mandel]] et al., had invited to participate in academic conferences and discussions in the US. The alien had been found ineligible for admission under 212 (a) (28) (D) and (G) (v) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, barring those who advocate or publish "the economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism." Kleindienst had declined to waive ineligibility as he has the power to do under 212 (d) of the Act, basing his decision on unscheduled activities engaged in by the alien on a previous visit to the United States, when a waiver was granted.

Even though it upheld consular nonreviewability, the opinion offered in the Kleindienst v. Mandel case paved the way for potential challenges to consular decisions. Specifically, Kleindienst v. Mandel rejected judicial review because it ruled that the consulate had offered a "bona fide and facially legitimate" reason for rejecting the visa. This suggested that in cases where such a reason was not provided, the consular decision may be subject to judicial review. This criterion for whether a consular decision might be eligible for judicial review would come to be known as the Mandel test.&lt;ref name=dobkin/&gt;

=== ''Kerry v. Din'' (2015) ===

''[[Kerry v. Din]]'' (576 U.S. ___) (2015) was a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that upheld the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. The case was filed by Fauzia Din, a United States citizen who had arrived in the country as a [[refugee]] from [[Afghanistan]] in 2000. In September 2006, she married Kanishka Berashk, a citizen of [[Afghanistan]], who had worked as a civil servant under the [[Taliban]] regime. Din then submitted a [[Form I-130]] petition to the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]], sponsoring Berashk under the Immediate Relative category. The petition was approved by the USCIS.

Berashk used the approved Form I-130 to apply for a visa to enter the United States. However, in June 2009, he was informed that his visa was denied; the stated reason for the denial was that he had provided material support to a terrorist but no further details were provided. Din filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] arguing that the government denied her due process of law by depriving her of her "constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse." The District Court rejected her argument, but the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed. The United States appealed the reversal in the Supreme Court. Per the ''Mandel'' test, there were two questions at hand:

# Was a constitutional right of Fauzia Din, a United States citizen, infringed upon?
# Was the reason offered by the consulate for rejecting Berashk's visa "bona fide and facially legitimate" per ''Mandel''?

The case was won by the United States, with the Supreme Court split in its opinion. [[Antonin Scalia]], [[John G. Roberts]], and [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote plurality opinions. [[Anthony Kennedy]] and [[Samuel Alito]] concurred.

Scalia's opinion rejected (1), i.e., he argued that the denial of a visa did not implicate a fundamental liberty interest, and that it differed from ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' in that the right to marriage was not being questioned. Kennedy's opinion differed from Scalia's in that he did not come to a definite conclusion regarding (1), but instead he rejected (2), arguing that even if Din's liberty was infringed upon, the reason explanation offered by the consulate for the denial (i.e., that Berashk had provided material support to a terrorist organization) fulfilled the government's obligations, and that further details were not required in cases where the application was denied due to terrorism or national security concerns.

[[Stephen Breyer]] wrote a dissenting opinion answering both (1) and (2) in the affirmative, in which he was joined by [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[Sonia Sotomayor]], and [[Elena Kagan]]. Scalia's opinion argued that  Kennedy's concurrence argued that the  On the other hand, Breyer's dissent argued that{{clarify inline|date=February 2017}} forbidding people from living together did effectively impede the right to marry, and that the level of explanation offered for the denial was inadequate, similar to "telling a criminal defendant that he is accused of breaking the law."

Although ''Kerry v. Din'' upheld the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, legal commentators viewed it as not carrying much additional weight as a precedent since the decision was based on only a slight majority (5-4) and even those ruling in favor of the United States offered different reasons.&lt;ref name=lawandborder-kerry&gt;{{cite web|url = http://lawandborder.com/supreme-court-consulate-need-not-tell-u-s-citizen-why-husbands-visa-denied/|title = Kerry v.

'''Demeny voting''' is the provision of a [[suffrage|political voice]] for children by allowing parents or [[legal guardian|guardians]] to vote on their behalf. The term was coined by [[Warren C. Sanderson]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, 2007. A Near Electoral Majority of Penioners. Population and Development Review, Volume 33, Issue 3, pages 543–554, September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a Demeny [[voting system]], each parent would cast a [[proxy vote]], worth half a vote, for each of their [[dependant|dependent]] children, thus allowing for a split vote if the parents' political views differ. Once children reach the minimum [[voting age]], their parents would no longer vote on their behalf.

==History==

Demeny voting is named after [[demography|demographer]] [[Paul Demeny]], who came up with the idea in 1986. Demeny argued that children "should not be left disenfranchised for some 18 years: let custodial parents exercise the children's voting rights until they come of age". Demeny's motivation behind proposing such a system was to "make the political system more responsive to the young generation's interests" and was part of a broader set of policy proposals aimed at combating the low [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]] in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;Demeny, P. 1986 "Pronatalist Policies in Low-Fertility Countries: Patterns, Performance and Prospects," ''Population and Development Review'', vol. 12 (supplement): 335–358.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea, however, is older than Demeny's idea; it was regularly discussed in France in the 1920s and was almost adopted by the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Parijs, Philippe van, 1999 ,"The Disenfranchisement of the Elderly, and Other Attempts to Secure Intergenerational Justice", ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', vol. 27,: 292–333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinrichs, Karl 2002"&gt;Hinrichs, Karl, 2002,"Do the Old Exploit the Young? Is Enfranchising Children a Good Idea?", ''Archives of European Sociology'' Vol 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the idea was even first discussed in the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;Rupprecht, I. "Das Wahlrecht für Kinder", Baden-Baden 2012, Nomos-Verlag: 26–32&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and the 1980s lawyers and political scientists began a discussion which is still going on. In
2003 and 2008 the German parliament had votes on whether to introduce a ''Kinderwahlrecht'' (which is the term in German), but the proposals were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geo.de/GEOlino/nachrichten/1471.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Hermann started a comprehensive economic approach to discuss it.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, U. "Ökonomische Analyse eines Kinderwahlrechts", Saarbrücken, südwestdeutscher verlag, http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/receive/FUDISS_thesis_000000021349?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieter Vanhuysse (head of research and Deputy Director at the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research, Vienna) argued in 2013 that in Austria, where there are relatively strong pro-elderly policies, that "the time is ripe for at least opening a clear-headed and empirically informed democratic debate about the radical idea of giving each parent one half extra vote, to be used on behalf of each under-age child until that child reaches legal voting age".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.centre.org/data/1381844857_65713.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan has discussed Demeny voting as a possible answer to its aging population, which gives disproportionate voice to the elderly as a result of their increasing numbers. This follows the publication of a paper by [[Reiko Aoki]] of the Centre for Intergenerational Studies at [[Hitotsubashi University]] and [[Rhema Vaithianathan]] of the [[University of Auckland]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hitpiecis/435.htm EconPapers: Is Demeny Voting the Answer to Low Fertility in Japan?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 2011, the Centre for Intergenerational Studies at Hitotsubashi University hosted a conference on Demeny voting.&lt;ref&gt;http://cis.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/Japanese/society/conferences-shoushika.html&lt;/ref&gt; Aoki and Vaithianathan have also conducted a number of surveys on voter attitude to Demeny Voting and found that a considerable percentage of respondents would cast their children's vote differently to their own. In July 2013, Nikkei in Japan wrote a major editorial supporting the idea as part of a debate on constitutional reform in Japan.

In [[Hungary]], the ruling [[coalition government|coalition]] has been advocating Demeny voting, but admitted in April 2011 that it probably won't come into practice for some time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.hu/20110404/fidesz-official-urges-body-set-up-to-examine-giving-extra-vote-to-families/ Politics.hu, April 4th, 2011: "Fidesz official urges body set up to examine giving extra vote to families"] Retrieved 2011-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Demeny discussed the idea on a CBC interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/video/news/audioplayer.html?clipid=1887678996 CBC interview with Paul Demeny]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Miles Corak from the University of Ottawa has also written a blog on the idea and promoted it in Canada. He suggests that it is supported on a humanitarian basis since the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that children be given civil and political rights. He suggests that given the evidence that households where mothers control the purse-strings spend more on their children, it is mothers who ought to be given the proxy vote until the child comes of age. Professor Corak's thesis has been taken up by journalist [[Chrystia Freeland]] .

==Advantages==
Aoki and Vaithianathan argue that Demeny voting is justified because it reduces [[gerontocracy]]. They calculate that Demeny voting in Japan would increase the parent voting bloc to 37% and lower the over-55-year-old voter-bloc to 35%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hitpiecis/435.htm EconPapers: Is Demeny Voting the Answer to Low Fertility in Japan?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stefan Olsson]]&lt;ref&gt;Olsson, Stefan, 2008,"Children's Suffrage: A Critique of the Importance of Voters' Knowledge for the Well-Being of Democracy", The International Journal of Children's Rights'', vol. 16,: 55–76.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "the delegation of the children's right to vote is not any stranger than when adults delegate political authority to their elected representative. After the election, the representatives have the right to make use of this authority." (page 71). He suggests that delegating a child's authority to the parent is perfectly reasonable. Olsson also argues that there are other areas where parents are delegated authority such as what the child eats, where he goes to school, and children are regularly represented in a court of law by parents.  He says that "Arguing that parents cannot act as their children's representative because they might abuse their position becomes absurd in comparison to all the other [[parental rights|powers]] parents already have over their children." (page 72).

It has been suggested it would make it harder for elderly voters to vote in governments that borrow money for [[social security]] but which will only be paid back by future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://the-diplomat.com/tokyo-notes/2011/01/15/should-parents-vote-for-kids/ Should Parents Vote for Kids? | Tokyo Notes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It may ensure that the needs of children, such as education, [[childcare]], and healthcare, are better taken into account.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/ifoContent/N/neucesifo/CONFERENCES/SC_CONF_2008/Fertility%20and%20Public%20Policy/Sanderson_fpp08_neu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It could also make governments more [[ecology|ecologically]] conscious as younger people will be more affected by poor [[environmental policy]] than older voters. Finally, extending the vote to children may increase their involvement in politics, encouraging children to grow up and be more active citizens.

==Disadvantages==
Opponents see Demeny voting as a violation of a fundamental normative principle of democracy: '[[one_man, one_vote|one person, one vote]]'. They point to the fact that children below the minimum voting age can hold different political opinions and thus prefer different parties to their parents.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} There is no evidence that parents would split their votes. Instead, they would have plural votes for the same party they prefer (and have formerly preferred).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some writers argue that, like marrying or making a will, voting is an exercise of the informed will and cannot legitimately be done by proxy.&lt;ref name="Hinrichs, Karl 2002"/&gt; Others have argued that with the right to vote comes other obligations of [[citizenship]], such as [[military service]]. Since children do not have those obligations, it is argued they should also not have such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Schrag, F., 2004,  "Children and Democracy: Theory and Practice Politics", ''Philosophy and Economics'' Vol 3&lt;/ref&gt; Some people worry that the power of older votes will be diluted and the interests of children might be prioritised above those of the elderly.

Yet others have argued that lowering the [[voting age]] to 13 or 14 or lower would be more beneficial, as many children are able to express complex opinions at that age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2009/07/against-demeny-voting.html No Right Turn: Against Demeny voting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2007/06/lowering-voting-age.html No Right Turn: Lowering the voting age&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scholars advocate a 'flexible voting age' building on the willingness of minors to participate in elections.&lt;ref&gt;5.	Tremmel, Jörg / Wilhelm, James (2015): Democracy or Epistocracy? Age as a Criterion of Voter Eligibility. In: Tremmel, Jörg / Mason, Antony / Dimitrijoski, Igor / Godli, Petter (eds.): Youth Quotas in Ageing Societies. Dordrecht, NL: Springer, pp. 125–147.&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘flexible voting age’ proposal contains a need for adolescents to register in voting lists and so differs from proposals that come under the name of ‘voting from birth on’ or ‘voting age zero’. It takes into account that infants, small children and many younger adolescents will have no interest in political participation. 

[[Jon Elster]] has argued that if the justification for Demeny is on the basis of consequences, then said consequences should be voted on, rather than changing the voting demographic. His argument is that to advance Demeny voting on the grounds that it leads to desirable consequences is pointless, since it will be blocked by exactly those groups who will block the desired consequences (e.g. raising the pension age).&lt;ref&gt;Elster, Jon (1986) "Comment on van der Veen and Van Parijs", ''Theory and Society'' pp.709- 722&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Esselen''' was the language of the tiny [[Esselen]] (or self-designated ''Huelel'') Nation, which aboriginally occupied the mountainous [[Central Coast of California]], immediately south of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] (Shaul 1995). It was probably a [[language isolate]], though has been included as a part of the hypothetical [[Hokan]] proposal.

Esselen may have been the first California language to become [[extinct language|extinct]]. Although it was spoken by many of the early converts at [[Mission Carmel]], its use rapidly declined during the Hispanic period. Very little information on the vocabulary and grammar of Esselen was preserved beyond a few word lists and a short bilingual catechism (for a summary see Mithun 1999:411–413 and Golla 2011:114). By the beginning of the 20th century the only data on Esselen that investigators such as [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Kroeber]] and [[John Peabody Harrington|Harrington]] could collect were a few words remembered by speakers of other Indian languages in the area.

In [[archaeology]], '''fire-cracked rock''' (FCR) or '''fire-affected rock''' (FAR), is rock of any type that has been altered and split as the result of deliberate heating.  It is a feature of many [[archaeological site]]s, throughout the [[United States]]. In many cases, fire-cracked rock results when stones were used to line [[hearth]]s and earth ovens or were heated to provide a longer-lasting heat-source (similar to a modern hot water bottle).  

In other cases, fire-cracked rock results from stone being used to heat or boil water; the stones were heated and dropped directly into water held in containers made of skin or baskets and [[pottery]]. This use has led fire-cracked rocks to be called 'pot-boilers' in Britain.

Central [[Texas]] in the [[United States]] in particular is well-known archaeologically for its burned rock [[midden]]s, which are piles of fire-cracked rock—often exceeding several tons of material. These represent the remains of earth ovens used in cooking [[sotol]] bulbs and other plants during prehistoric times. In Britain these features are referred to as 'burnt mounds'.

'''''Gender, Technology and Development (GTD)''''' is a double blind [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal that serves as a forum for exploring the linkages between gender relations, development and/or technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rgtd20/current|title=Gender, Technology and Development|last=Taylor and Francis|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the journal is to provide a platform for original research and theorizing on the shifting meanings of gender, as it relates to advances in science and technologies and/or to social, political, economic, and cultural change. In particular, the journal is interested in addressing these in the context of transnational phenomena and engaging in dialogues that cut across geographical boundaries. 

It is published three times a year. The journal was founded in 1997 and until 2016 was published by [http://www.sagepub.in/home.nav SAGE Publications] in association with the [http://www.gds.ait.ac.th Gender and Development Studies] program at the [http://www.ait.ac.th/ Asian Institute of Technology.] Since 2017, the journal is published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor and Francis]] Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ait.ac.th/2018/01/aits-gender-technology-development-journal-completes-two-decades-impactful-work/|title=AIT’s 'Gender, Technology and Development' journal completes two decades of impactful work {{!}} Asian Institute of Technology|date=2018-01-25|work=Asian Institute of Technology|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kusakabe|first=Kyoko|last2=Doneys|first2=Philippe|last3=Chatterjee|first3=Joyee S.|date=|year=2017|title=Looking forward, looking back: Gender, Technology and Development in a changing world|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09718524.2017.1407069|journal=Gender, Technology and Development|volume=21|issue=1-2|pages=1-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also in association with the [[Asian Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ait.ac.th|title=Asian Institute of Technology {{!}} Bangkok, Thailand|website=Asian Institute of Technology|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6647">[[Image:Gold-Hut klein-cm.png|thumb|The Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch]]
The '''Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch''' ({{lang-de|Goldblechkegel von Ezelsdorf Buch}}) is a [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]] discovered in 1953 between the villages of [[Burgthann|Ezelsdorf]] ([[Middle Franconia]]) and [[Postbauer-Heng|Buch]] ([[Upper Palatinate]]) in [[Southern Germany]]. A tall (88&amp;nbsp;cm), cone-shaped object made of thin sheet gold, it is seen as belonging to a group of artifacts referred to as [[Bronze Age]] [[Golden hats]]. It was presumably worn by special functionaries on ceremonial occasions.

== Cultural Context and date ==
The Ezelsdorf-Buch cone is one of four such known items. Two of them were discovered in Southern Germany, one in the west of [[France]], and one is without provenance, believed to have been found in Switzerland or Germany. It dates to ''circa'' 1,000 to 900 BC.

Parallels have been drawn between the golden 'hats' and depictions found on the [[The King's Grave|Kivik slabs]] and on objects from the Stockhult hoard discovered in [[Scandinavia]].

The 'hat', like its counterparts, is assumed to have served as a religious insignia for the deities or priests of a sun-cult common in Bronze Age Europe. The hats are also suggested to have served [[Golden hats#Calendars|calendrical functions]].

== Provenance and find history ==
The Ezelsdorf-Buch Cone was discovered accidentally during the removal of tree-stumps in 1953. However, it was not recognised as an [[archaeology|archaeological find]] immediately, and its top was torn and broken by digging tools, probably weakening or destroying the structure of the whole object. It is also possible that the object had been damaged previously or that it had fully or partially collapsed during burial. It was probably originally buried in an upright position, with its top relatively near ground level, as were its [[Berlin Gold Hat|Berlin]] and [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt|Schifferstadt]] counterparts. After recovery, the cone was mutilated and torn into small scraps of sheet gold. Although it could be mostly reconstructed at an early stage, it was only in the 1990s that the find was understood as belonging to the group of "[[golden hats]]".

== Description ==
[[Image:EzelsdorfBuch Golden Hat schematic.jpg|thumb|Schematic depiction of the Ezelsdorf Cone's decorative scheme]]
Including the part now missing, the 'hat' would have weighed about 330 g. Like its counterparts, it was hammered from a single piece of gold, decorated in the [[repoussé]] technique with bands and rows of symbols, had a somewhat convex, cap-like, lower portion and was originally equipped with a 'brim', which was probably lost during its recovery. Like the Berlin example, it was reinforced by one or several bronze rings near the bottom.

The cone is now (in reconstructed form) 88.3&amp;nbsp;cm high, but was probably somewhat shorter, at 72&amp;nbsp;cm or more.

Along its whole length, the object's surface is subdivided and decorated by horizontal bands or ribs and by rows of symbols. In total, there are 154 bands and symbol rows. The symbols are mostly circular bosses enclosed by up to seven concentric circles, as known from all other specimens. There are three sets of unusual special motifs: small horizontal ovals resembling eyes (row 92, also known from Schifferstadt and Berlin), small eight-spoked wheels (row 120) and miniature cones (rows 127 and 105). The latter are unique to the Ezesldorf-Buch cone and appear to represent the shape of a gold 'hat'. The tip of the cone is embellished with a ten-point star. The area where the cone joins the cap-like area is embellished with a 30&amp;nbsp;mm wide band of vertical grooving, as is the case on the Berlin example.

== Manufacture ==
The piece is hammered from a gold [[alloy]]; [[gold]] (88.3%), [[silver]] (11%), [[copper]] (0.59%) and [[tin]] (0.086%). Its average thickness is only 0.78&amp;nbsp;mm. The amount of gold used for making the object is equivalent to the size of a matchbox.

Twenty different decorative punches, a comb, and six stamp-wheels or cylindrical stamps were used to apply the patterns. For a more detailed discussion of the cone's manufacture, see [[Golden hats#Manufacture|here]].

== Present location ==
The Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch is on display in the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]], [[Nuremberg]].

[[File:Golden-age-mu-map.jpg|thumb|The metaphor of a ''Golden Age'' is often invoked for high points of lost knowledge in the mythical past]]

A '''golden age''' is a period in a field of endeavor when [[greatness|great]] tasks were accomplished. The term originated from early [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] poets, who used it to refer to a time when mankind lived in a better time and was pure (see [[Golden Age]]).

The [[ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Hesiod]] introduced the term in his ''[[Works and Days]]'', when referring to the period when the "Golden Race" of man lived. This was part of fivefold division of [[Ages of Man]], starting with the Golden age, then the [[Silver Age]], the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Greek Heroic Age|Age of Heroes]] (including the [[Trojan War]]), and finally, the current Iron Age.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=R.C.|title=An Introduction to Hesiod’s ''Works and Days''|journal=The Review of Politics|year=2006|volume=68|pages=177–205|doi=10.1017/S003467050600009X|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=441023&amp;jid=ROP&amp;volumeId=68&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=441022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was further refined by [[Ovid]], in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', into the four "metal ages" (golden, silver, bronze, and iron).&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses''. Trans. A.D. Melville. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986. Print. Pages ix–xi&lt;/ref&gt;

By definition, the Golden Age is always in the past.

==The Golden age in Classic literature==
{{Main|Golden Age}}
[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1530]]
[[File:'The Golden Age', oil on copper painting by Joachim Wtewael, 1605, Metropolitan Museum of Art.JPG|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' by [[Joachim Wtewael]], 1605]]
The Golden age as described by Hesiod was an age where all humans were created directly by the Olympian gods. They did not have women in their ranks, and could not reproduce. They lived long lives in peace and harmony, and were oblivious of death. The "Golden race" were however mortals, but would die peacefully and in their sleep unmarked by sickness and age.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt; Ovid emphasizes the justice and peace that defined the Golden Age. He described it as a time before man learned the art of navigation, and as a pre-agricultural society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDermott|first=E.|title='The Metal Face of the Age': Hesiod, Vergil, and the Iron  Age on Cold Mountain|journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition|year=2011|volume=17|issue=2|pages=244–256|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225184443/http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi|archivedate=2011-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a Golden age lingered in literature and historical understanding throughout the Greek and Roman periods.&lt;ref name="tertullian1"&gt;{{cite web|author=St. Jerome |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_01_prefaces.htm |title=St. Jerome, Chronicle (2004-5). Preface of Jerome; Preface of Eusebius |publisher=Tertullian.org |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was partly replaced by the Christian [[Six Ages of the World]] based on the biblical chronology in the early [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{emc1|Graeme Dunphy|Six Ages of the World|1367-1370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution from period to metaphor==
The term "Golden age" has always had a metaphoric element. A few centuries after Hesiod, [[Plato]] pointed out that the "Golden race" were not made from gold as such, but that the term should be understood metaphorically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boys-Stones|first=edited by G.R.|title=Plato and Hesiod|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199236343|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|author2=Haubold, J.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical idea of the "metal ages" as actual historical periods held sway throughout the Greek and Roman periods.&lt;ref name="tertullian1"/&gt; While supplemented by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s "[[Six Ages of the World]]", the classical ideas were never entirely eradicated, and it resurfaced to form the basis of division of time in early [[archaeology]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

At the birth of modern archaeology in the 18th century, the "Golden age" was associated with a pre-agricultural society. However, already in the 16th century, the term "Golden age" was replaced by "[[Stone age]]" in the [[three-age system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ref=harv | title=Questioning Thunderstones and Arrowheads: The Problem of Recognizing and Interpreting Stone Artifacts in the Seventeenth Century | first=Matthew R. | last=Goodrum | journal=Early Science and Medicine | volume=13 | year=2008 | pages=482–508 | doi=10.1163/157338208X345759 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | ref=harv | last=Gräslund | first=Bo |year=1987 |title=The Birth of Prehistoric Chronology. Dating methods and dating systems in nineteenth-century Scandinavian archeology | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] used the term for a loosely defined historical period characterized by the "[[State of nature]]" as late as the during the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartzog|first=P.B.|title=Rousseau and Marx on Equality: Paradise Lost, Paradise Restored|url=http://www.panarchy.com/Members/PaulBHartzog/Papers/Rousseau%20and%20Marx%20on%20Equality.pdf|publisher=The University of Utah|accessdate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510191449/http://www.panarchy.com/Members/PaulBHartzog/Papers/Rousseau%20and%20Marx%20on%20Equality.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept of an Iron and Bronze Age are still used by historians and archaeologists, the "Golden age" of Hesiod was a purely mythical period, and has come to signify any period in history where the state of affairs for a specific phenomenon appear to have been on their height, better than in the periods proceeding it and following the "Golden Age". It is sometimes still employed for the [[hunter-gatherer]] tribal societies of the [[Mesolithic]], but only as a metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[David Maybury-Lewis]]|title=Millennium : tribal wisdom and the modern world|year=1992|publisher=Viking|location=New York, N.Y., U.S.A.|isbn=0-670-82935-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and technology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
A golden age is often ascribed to the years immediately following some technological innovation. It is during this time that writers and artists ply their skills to this new medium.  Therefore, there are Golden Ages of both [[radio]] and [[television]].  During this nascent phase the technology allows new ideas to be expressed, as new art forms flower quickly into new areas:

*Golden age of illustration, a [[Illustration#Golden age of illustration|period in US illustration history]] from the 1880s to the 1910s.
*[[old-time radio|The Golden Age of Radio]], 1920s–1940s
*[[The Golden Age of American animation]], between 1928 (sound) and the 1960s (television).
* The [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]], which lasted from the end of the silent era in American cinema in the late 1920s to the early 1960s
*[[Golden Age of Television]] (referring to U.S. television circa 1950s) when [[television]] was still a fairly recent invention. Programs such as ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'', ''[[Playhouse 90]]'', and later ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' brought a level of writing to American commercial television that would rarely be seen in the next several decades.

* Golden Age of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], the period from about 1943 to 1968 that brought musicals like ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943); ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' (1948); ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' (1957); ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959); and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964) to the Broadway stage
* Golden Age of [[British dance band]]s, 1920s–1930s
* [[whodunit|Golden Age of the British whodunit]], early 20th century
* [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], period between roughly 1938 and 1945, though exact definitions vary

* Golden age of Swordplay, period of [[sword]] skills between 16th and 18th century
* Golden Age of the Western, of the [[Western (genre)|Western]] movie, 1930s–1960s

==Science==
* The [[Golden age of general relativity]], upon its entering the mainstream of theoretical physics, 1960–75.

==Senior citizen==
Companies will use "Golden Age" as a [[marketing]] [[euphemism]] to replace "[[senior citizen]]":

*[[Golden Age Passport]], a [[National Park Service]] pass for citizens who are 62 or older.

[[File:Madeira Barbeito Medium Dry Colheita-1999 Canteiro - Bottle + Glass.jpg|thumb|Madeira wine]]
The [http://www.limeliters.net/have-some-madeira-mdear---lyrics.html lyrics]&lt;ref&gt;http://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiMADERA.html&lt;/ref&gt; tell of an elderly [[Rake (character)|rake]] who "slyly inveigles" an attractive young girl of seventeen to his flat where he offers her a glass of [[Madeira (wine)|Madeira]], a fortified Portuguese wine. The girl enthusiastically drains her glass, becoming slightly drunk in the process. Sensing victory, the rake offers the young girl another glass of wine, which she accepts. However, before raising it to her lips, she recalls her dying mother's warning to avoid red wine. With a cry, the girl drops the glass and flees the apartment, the old roué's pleas for her to remain echoing in her ears. The following morning, however, the young lady awakens in bed with a hangover and a beard tickling her ear.

The song contains three much-quoted instances of [[Zeugma#Syllepsis|syllepsis]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Oliver | first1 = A. | title = Strategies for a Logic of Plurals | journal = [[The Philosophical Quarterly]] | volume = 51 | issue = 204 | pages = 289 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1111/j.0031-8094.2001.00231.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Everett | first1 = Anthony | title = Recent Defenses of Descriptivism | journal = [[Mind &amp; Language]] | volume = 20 | pages = 103 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1111/j.0268-1064.2005.00279.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"And he said as he hastened to put out the cat, the wine, his cigar and the lamps"
"She lowered her standards by raising her glass, her courage, her eyes and his hopes"
"She made no reply, up her mind and a dash for the door."&lt;ref name=fs&gt;Flanders and Swann, pp. 143–145&lt;/ref&gt;

The song has been covered by other groups, including most notably [[The Limeliters]] (performed by Lou Gottlieb). The lyrics were also recited as a poem by [[Tony Randall]] in episode #922 of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' which first aired 02/21/1976.

[[Sam Leith]] has referred to it as a "hilarious song about [[date rape]]".&lt;ref name=Leith&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=5sWVmvCEEnYC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=%22have+some+madeira%22+rape&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Uj75F0EszA&amp;sig=MO2vtA0-so2D8EQhidpQaCymDCM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjm96eRg6DUAhWLzIMKHY3HAaMQ6AEITTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22have%20some%20madeira%22e&amp;f=false You Talkin' To Me?: Rhetoric from Aristotle to Obama], by [[Sam Leith]]; published Oct 20, 2011, by [[Profile Books]]; via [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23041">A '''heritage railway''' is a railway operated as [[living history]] to re-create or preserve railway scenes of the past. Heritage railways are often old railway lines preserved in a state depicting a period (or periods) in the history of [[rail transport]].

== Definition ==
The British [[Office of Rail and Road]] defines heritage railways as follows: "...'lines of local interest', museum railways or tourist railways that have retained or assumed the character and appearance and operating practices of railways of former times. Several lines that operate in isolation provide genuine transport facilities, providing community links. Most lines constitute tourist or educational attractions in their own right. Much of the rolling stock and other equipment used on these systems is original and is of historic value in its own right. Many systems aim to replicate both the look and operating practices of historic former railways companies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Minor and Heritage Railways|url=http://orr.gov.uk/about-orr/who-we-work-with/railway-networks/minor-and-heritage-railways|publisher=Office of Rail and Road|accessdate=August 16, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222044131/http://orr.gov.uk/about-orr/who-we-work-with/railway-networks/minor-and-heritage-railways|archivedate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Heritage line}}Infrastructure ==
Heritage railway lines have historic rail infrastructure which has been substituted (or made obsolete) in modern rail systems. Historical installations, such as hand-operated [[Railroad switch|points]], [[water crane]]s, and rails fastened with hand-hammered [[rail spike]]s, are characteristic features of heritage lines. Unlike tourist railways, which primarily carry tourists and have modern installations and vehicles, heritage-line infrastructure creates views and [[soundscape]]s of the past in operation.

== Operation ==
Due to a lack of modern technology or the desire for historical accuracy, railway operations can be handled with traditional practices such as the use of [[Token (railway signalling)|tokens]]. Heritage infrastructure and operations often require the assignment of roles, based on historical occupations, to the railway staff. [[Station master]]s and [[Signalman (rail)|signalmen]], sometimes wearing period-appropriate attire, can be seen on some heritage railways. Most heritage railways use heritage rolling stock, although modern rail vehicles can be used to showcase railway scenes with historical-line infrastructure. 
 
=== {{anchor|Finance}}Cost ===
While some heritage railways are profitable [[tourist attraction]]s, many are not-for-profit entities; some of the latter depend on enthusiastic volunteers for upkeep and operations to supplement revenue from traffic and visitors. Still other heritage railways offer a viable public-transit option, and can maintain operations with revenue from regular riders or government subsidies.

== Development ==
=== Children's railways ===

[[Children's railway]]s are extracurricular educational institutions where children and teenagers learn about railway work; they are often functional, passenger-carrying narrow-gauge rail lines. The railways developed in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] during the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]]. Many were called "Pioneer railways", after the [[Pioneer movement|youth organisation of that name]]. The first children's railway opened in [[Moscow]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dzd-ussr.ru/towns/moscow/cpkio.html Children's railways: Gorky Park, Moscow {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1932 and, at the breakup of the USSR, 52 children's railways existed in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/globe/feature/trans-siberian/AJ201209090025 'Children's railway' a training ground for future rail personnel ]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the fall of communist governments has led to the closure of some, preserved children's railways are still functioning in [[post-Soviet states]] and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern European countries]].

Many children's railways were built on parkland in urban areas. Unlike many industrial areas typically served by a narrow-gauge railway, parks were free of redevelopment. Child volunteers and socialist fiscal policy enabled the existence of many of these railways. Children's railways which still carry traffic have often retained their original infrastructure and rolling stock, including vintage steam locomotives;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gyermekvasut.hu/english/page.php?8 Budapest Children's railways website: Rolling Stock&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitkosice.eu/en/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/childrens-railway Košice Children's railways&lt;/ref&gt; some have acquired heritage vehicles from other railways.

Examples of children's railways with steam locomotives include the [[Dresden Park Railway]] in Germany; the [[Gyermekvasút]] in [[Budapest]]; the [[Park Railway Maltanka]] in [[Poznań]]; the [[Košice]] Children's Railway in Slovakia, and the {{Track gauge|7.25in}} gauge steam railway on the grounds of St Nicholas' School in [[Merstham]], [[Surrey]], which the children help operate with assistance from the East Surrey 16mm Group and other volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldrailfans.info/7.25inch/GalleryMersthamVRConstruction.shtml The only British children's railway that is operational in 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eastsurrey16mm.org.uk/ Helps keep the school's railway running, and puts on a number of steam and model train shows at that school&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mountain railways ===
Creating passages for trains up steep hills and through [[mountain]] regions offers many obstacles which call for technical solutions. [[Steep grade railway]] technologies and extensive [[tunnel]]ing may be employed. The use of [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge]] allows tighter [[curve]]s in the track, and offers a smaller [[structure gauge]] and tunnel size. At high altitudes, construction and logistical difficulties, limited urban development and demand for transport and special rolling-stock requirements have left many [[mountain railway]]s unmodernized. The engineering feats of past railway builders and views of pristine mountain scenes have made many railways in mountainous areas profitable tourist attractions.

=== Pit railways ===
[[Pit railway]]s have been in operation in underground mines all over the world. Small rail vehicles transport ore, waste rock, and workers through narrow tunnels. Sometimes trains were the sole mode of transport in the passages between the work sites and the mine entrance. The railway's [[loading gauge]] often dictated the cross-section of passages to be dug. At many mining sites, pit railways have been abandoned due to mine closure or adoption of new transportation equipment. Some [[show mine]]s have a vintage pit railway and offer [[mantrip]] rides into the mine.

=== Underground railways ===
The [[Line 1 (Budapest Metro)|Metro 1]] (officially the Millennium Underground Railway or M1), built from 1894 to 1896, is the oldest line of the [[Budapest Metro]] system and the second-oldest underground railway in the world.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2002, the line was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/400 UNESCO]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Deák Ferenc Square concourse's Millennium Underground Museum, many other artifacts of the metro's early history may be seen.

== Around the world ==

===United Kingdom ===
In Britain, heritage railways are often railway lines which were run as commercial railways but were no longer needed (or closed down) and were taken over—or re-opened—by volunteers or non-profit organisations. A typical British heritage railway will use [[steam locomotive]]s and original [[rolling stock]] to create a period atmosphere, although some are concentrating on diesel and electric traction to re-create the post-steam era. Many run seasonally on partial routes, unconnected to a larger network (or railway), and charge high fares in comparison with transit services; as a result, they focus on the tourist and leisure markets. During the 1990s and 2000s, however, some heritage railways aimed to provide local transportation and extend their running seasons to carry commercial passenger traffic.

After the founding of the [[Edaville Railroad]] in [[Massachusetts]] by Ellis D. Atwood in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moody |first=Linwood W. |authorlink= |title=The Maine Two-Footers |url= |accessdate= |year=1959 |publisher=Howell-North |location= |isbn= |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first heritage railway to be rescued and run entirely by volunteers was the [[Talyllyn Railway]] in [[Wales]]. This [[narrow gauge]] line, taken over by a group of enthusiasts in 1950, was the beginning of the preservation movement in the [[United Kingdom]]. The world's third preserved railway, and the second outside the United Kingdom, was Australia's [[Puffing Billy Railway]]. This railway operates on {{convert|24|km}} of track, with much of its original rolling stock built as early as 1898. There are 100 to 150 heritage railways in the United Kingdom, and similar railway-preservation efforts by enthusiasts can be found in many other countries in Europe and the Commonwealth.

The large number of heritage railways in the UK is due in part to the closure of many minor lines during the 1960s' [[Beeching cuts]], and they were relatively easy to revive. The first standard-gauge line to be preserved (not a victim of Beeching) was the [[Middleton Railway]]; the second, and the first to carry passengers, was the [[Bluebell Railway]].

Not-for-profit heritage railways differ in their quantity of service. Although the Puffing Billy Railway provides more service than it did in its pre-preservation working life, some lines see traffic only on summer weekends. The more successful, such as the [[Severn Valley Railway]] and the [[North Yorkshire Moors Railway]], may have up to five or six steam locomotives and operate a four-train service daily; smaller railways may run daily throughout the summer with only one steam locomotive. The [[Great Central Railway (heritage railway)|Great Central Railway]], the only preserved British main line with a double track, can operate over 50 trains on a busy timetable day.

After the privatisation of main-line railways, the line between not-for-profit heritage railways and for-profit [[branch line]]s may be blurred. The [[Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway]] is an example of a commercial line run as a heritage operation and to provide local transportation, and the Severn Valley Railway has operated a few [[Rail freight transport|goods trains]] commercially. A number of heritage railway lines are regularly used by commercial freight operators.

Since the Bluebell Railway reopened to traffic in 1960, the definition of private [[standard gauge]] railways in the United Kingdom as preserved railways has evolved as the number of projects and their length, operating days and function have changed. The situation is further muddied by large variations in ownership-company structure, rolling stock and other assets. Unlike [[community rail]]ways, tourist railways in the UK are [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] (although those operating mainly as [[charities]] separate their [[Charitable organization|charitable]] and non-charitable activities for accounting purposes).

=== Slovakia ===
The [[Čierny Hron Railway]] is a [[narrow-gauge railway]] in central [[Slovakia]], established in the first decade of the 20th century and operating primarily as a freight railway for the local logging industry. From the late 1920s to the early 1960s, it also offered passenger transport between the villages of Hronec and Čierny Balog. The railway became [[Czechoslovakia]]'s most extensive [[forest railway]] network. After its closure in 1982, it received heritage status and was restored during the following decade. Since 1992, it has been one of Slovakia's official heritage railways and is a key regional tourist attraction. The [[Historical Logging Switchback Railway]] in Vychylovka is a heritage railway in north-central Slovakia, originally built to serve the logging industry in the [[Orava (region)|Orava]] and [[Kysuce]] regions. Despite a closure and dissasembly of most of its original network during the early 1970s, its surviving lines and branches have been (or are being) restored. The railway is owned and operated by the Museum of Kysuce, with a {{convert|3.8|km|adj=on}} line open to tourists for sightseeing.

=== Finland ===
[[Image:Porvoon asema.jpg|thumb|alt=Blue-and-yellow railbus at a rural station|Preserved [[railbus]] at the Porvoo railway station]]
On the Finnish state-owned [[Rail transport in Finland|rail network]], the section between Olli and [[Porvoo]] is a dedicated museum line. In southern [[Finland]], it is the only line with many structural details abandoned by the rest of the network which regularly carries passenger traffic. Wooden [[Railroad tie|sleepers]], gravel ballast and low [[Rail profile#Rail weights and size|rail weight]] with no [[overhead catenary]] make it uniquely historical.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.liikennevirasto.fi/julkaisut/pdf3/lv_2012-05_finnish_railway_web.pdf Finnish Railway Network Statement 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Along the line, the Hinthaara railway station and the Porvoo railway station area are included in the National Board of Antiquities' inventory of cultural environments of national significance in Finland. Also on the list is scenery in the [[Porvoonjoki]] Valley, through which the line passes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rky.fi/read/asp/r_kohde_list.aspx  the National Board of Antiquities' inventory of built cultural environments of national significance in Finland. In Finnish&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jokioinen Museum Railway]] is a stretch of preserved narrow-gauge railway between [[Humppila]] and [[Jokioinen]]. Nykarleby Järnväg is a stretch of rebuilt narrow-gauge railway on the bank of the old Kovjoki–[[Nykarleby]] line.&lt;ref&gt;http://nykarlebyjernvag.webs.com/inenglish.htm  the National Board of Antiquities' inventory of built cultural environments of national significance in Finland.

Heritage railways are known in the United States as tourist, historic, or scenic railroads. Most are remnants of original railroads, and some are reconstructed after having been scrapped. Some heritage railways preserve entire railroads in their original state using original structures, track, and motive power.

Examples of heritage railroads in the US by preservation type:
*Remnant
**[[Cumbres &amp; Toltec Scenic Railroad]] ([[Colorado]] and [[New Mexico]])
**[[Hocking Valley Scenic Railway]] ([[Ohio]])
**[[Heber Valley Railroad]] ([[Utah]])
*Reconstructed
**[[Sumpter Valley Railroad]] ([[Oregon]])
**[[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]] ([[Nevada]])
**[[Wiscasset, Waterville and Farmington Railway]] ([[Maine]])
*Original
**[[Nevada Northern Railway]] (Nevada)
**[[California Western Railroad]] ([[California]])
**[[Delaware and Ulster Railroad]] ([[New York (state)|New York]])
**[[Stewartstown Railroad]] ([[Pennsylvania]])
**[[Strasburg Rail Road]] (Pennsylvania)
Some do not fit in the above categories, like the [[Rio Grande Scenic Railroad]] (a subsidiary of the [[San Luis &amp; Rio Grande Railroad]]). The SL&amp;RG, primarily a freight operation on former [[Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad]] track, owns and operates a steam locomotive and a fleet of passenger cars (most of which are painted in D&amp;RGW colors). Many heritage railways host living-history events such as annual reenactments of historic activities, and may have an archive or library of railroad-related materials.

[[La Trochita]] (officially Viejo Expreso Patagónico, the Old Patagonian Express)
was declared a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|National Historic Monument]] by the [[Government of Argentina]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/1999/04/23/e-03901d.htm 'El Kavanagh, entre los protegidos'], [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|''Clarín'']], 1999-04-23 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Trains on the [[Patagonia]]n {{Track gauge|750mm|lk=on}} [[narrow-gauge railway]] use steam locomotives. The {{convert|402|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} railway runs through the foothills of the [[Andes]] between [[Esquel]] and [[El Maitén]] in [[Chubut Province]] and [[Ingeniero Jacobacci]] in [[Río Negro Province]].

In southern Argentina, the [[Train of the End of the World]] to the [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego]] National Park is considered the world's southernmost functioning railway. Heritage railway operations started in 1994, after restoration of the old {{Track gauge|500mm|lk=on}} (narrow-gauge) [[steam locomotive|steam railway]].

"'''Insheeption'''" {{IPAc-en|ɪ|n|ˈ|ʃ|iː|p|ʃ|ən}} is the tenth episode of the [[South Park (season 14)|fourteenth season]] of animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 205th episode of the series overall. It premiered October 20, 2010 on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States. In the episode, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Mr. Mackey]] suffer a [[Compulsive hoarding|hoarding disorder]]. In an attempt to find the cause for it, they get trapped in Mr. Mackey's dream. The episode spoofs the TV show ''[[Hoarders]]'' and the film ''[[Inception]].''

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[TV-MA]] LV in the United States and MA15+(a) in Australia.

==Plot==
After Wendy expresses concern that [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] suffers from [[compulsive hoarding]], he agrees to have it checked. A hoarding specialist named Dr. Chinstrap, as well as the rest of the student body, help Stan go through his locker, which is quite stuffed with a number of disgusting items, including a maggot-infested sandwich and broken toothbrush which Stan, who soon loses his composure, refuses to give up, shocking [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and the rest of the school. They send him to Mr. Mackey, who does not know what hoarding is; Stan discovers that Mackey is a hoarder himself. (Mr. Mackey also refuses to give up his items too)
 
Stan and Mackey, along with a [[shepherd|sheep herder]] named Mr. Yelman (repeatedly misidentified as a sheep "hoarder"), are hooked up to a machine which Chinstrap and his assistant Dr. Pinkerton explains that they will help them figure out why they are hoarders by drifting them to their subconscious. Moments later in Mackey's subconscious he is being bullied by a boy named Billy Thompson, who threatens to attack Mackey at a field trip the next day.  Mackey then runs into Stan and the sheep hoarder who, as the scientists explain in reality, are there because of the power of Mackey's dream. Within the dream, Stan goes home with Mackey and tries to talk him out of the dream, but Mackey instead plays with his [[Lite-Brite]] and old toys and watches ''[[ZOOM (1972 TV series)|ZOOM]]''. Randy insists he has to rescue his son from the dream despite Chinstrap's warning that he will be stuck there forever.

The dream moves on to the next morning where Stan, Mackey, the sheep hoarder, and the kids board a bus for the field trip. Stan suddenly sees Randy, who is for some reason a butterfly. Stan asks if he has come to help but Randy reveals that, while that was his intention, he is more concerned with getting "butterfly [[wikt:poon|poon]]". Pinkerton claims that they have called in another group of "experts" in the form of the main characters from ''[[Inception]]'' (one of them shapeshifting into NFL quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]]) to go into the dream to create a "dream within a dream" and rescue them, with Chinstrap [[Beatboxing|providing boombox sounds]] recreating ''Inception'''s music theme during the explanation. The second group, the cast from ''Inception'', comes in shooting at people before going into the dream, where they proceed to shoot even more people in the woods as the group arrives. Stan, the sheep hoarder and Mackey are introduced to [[Woodsy Owl]], an owl with the tagline "give a hoot, don't pollute" before being put in with Billy and his two friends.

Chinstrap and Pinkerton are now seen courting firefighters to get into the dream and begin trying to explain the events to Sharon (Compared to a taco inside of a taco inside a [[Taco Bell]] inside a [[KFC]] within a mall inside a dream), who claims it all sounds ridiculous and stupid. A pizza guy arrives and is sent in as well, as Sharon is told she does not understand because she is not smart. Within the dream, Mackey and Stan are running from the bullies when Stan convinces Mackey to stand up for himself. Mackey prepares for a fight. Back in reality, Chinstrap decides the dream has become too powerful, and at this point they must court "the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world" who is [[Freddy Krueger]]. While Freddy Krueger does not wish to come back, they convince him to help out a final time.

Within Mackey's dream, the second group of experts arrive to kill Billy Thompson and the tormentors before the fire fighters arrive, which they assumed would cure Mackey and end the dream. But when they realized Mackey's not waking up, he remembers what happened, explaining he ran from the bullies and went into a shack, where someone talked nice to him but then touched him in a bad way.  Mackey then comes upon that same shack and enters, revealing another young Mackey being [[Child sexual abuse|sexually molested]] by Woodsy Owl. Woodsy then turns into a nightmarish monster, killing the sheep hoarder and overpowering the Inception cast before being killed from behind by Freddy Krueger. With Woodsy destroyed, everyone wakes up and Mackey explains he must have become a hoarder because of Woodsy's tagline about not polluting. Freddy expresses remorse because he could not save the sheep herder (ironically the only one who recognizes him correctly as a shepherd). They suggest to Stan that he move on to his own therapy now, but he claims to have a better idea.  He is then seen throwing out the items in his locker. Wendy and Kyle ask him what his problem was and Stan says that after what happened with Mackey, he does not want any therapy. Kyle suggests that maybe that "was your therapy". Finally, Chinstrap comes out again doing the ''Inception'' soundtrack as the episode ends.

==College Humor borrowings==
Upon the episode's release, Dan Gurewitch from the humor website [[CollegeHumor]], noted several similarities between ''Insheeption'' and his own ''Inception'' parody video, "[http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6250359/inception-characters-dont-understand-inception Inception Characters Don't Understand Inception]", which he had made with David Young and first posted to the CollegeHumor website on July 19, 2010. He discovered that many lines from the ''South Park'' episode seemed to be lifted almost verbatim from their sketch. Matt Stone later issued an apology, admitting when they had intended to parody the complexity of ''Inception'', they did not have a copy of the film to reference, instead turning to the internet for information on the film.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{cite web |date = October 22, 2010 |first = Sean |last = O'Neal |url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/south-park-creators-apologize-for-borrowing-from-c,46720/ |title = South Park creators apologize for borrowing from CollegeHumor Inception parody}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We thought their joke was that a lot of those lines were actually in the movie, and they were banging them against each other, and showing that the ''Inception'' characters didn't even know ''Inception''. That was a mistake, and it was an honest mistake… It's just because we do the show in six days, and we're stupid and we just threw it together. But in the end, there are some lines that we had to call and apologize for."&lt;ref name=CH/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gurewitch has since said that their apology was accepted, and that he and Young plan to "meet up with Matt and Trey when they're in New York."&lt;ref name="CH" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 22, 2010 |author=Dave ITZKOFF |title=South Park Creators Apologize for Using Other Writers' Lines |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/business/media/23southpark.html |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Randy becoming a happy butterfly in the dream has reference to Chinese philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]'s philosophy of "[[Zhuangzi (book)#"The Butterfly Dream"|The Butterfly Dream]]" where he argues if he had dreamt he was a happy butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi.

* The episode's title and plot parody and make many references to the film ''[[Inception]],'' with the main characters from the film playing a major part on the episode. The movie's pseudo-intellectualism, supposed complexity, and subsequent critical acclaim are also satirized with Sharon claiming, "Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex, doesn't make it cool."

[[IGN]] gave the episode a score of 7 out of 10 and wrote: "This episode had a great premise, and I did find myself laughing a couple of times (Cartman's few lines in this story are hilarious), but this installment gave me the impression that the creative team weren't really trying that hard. I've said it before, but it bears repeating – it seems like these new episodes are more like Robot Chicken fare (no offense to you RC lovers out there, though South Park is not to be compared to Robot Chicken), than the usual stuff we've come to expect from SP. Maybe the team is distracted by other things, or maybe the debacle with the Mohammed episode took some wind out of their sails, but the spark seems to be missing, and I'm hoping it returns soon."&lt;ref name="ign-review"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Johannes-Clericus-1657.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Johannes Clericus&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Jean Le Clerc''', also '''Johannes Clericus''' (March 19, 1657 in [[Geneva]] – January 8, 1736 in [[Amsterdam]]), was a [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]] [[theologian]] and [[biblical scholar]].  He was famous for promoting [[exegesis]], or critical interpretation of the [[Bible]], and was a radical of his age. He parted with [[Calvinism]] over his interpretations and left Geneva for that reason.

==Early life==
His father, Stephen Le Clerc, was professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] in Geneva. The family originally belonged to the neighborhood of [[Beauvais]] in France, and several of its members acquired some name in literature. Jean Le Clerc applied himself to the study of philosophy under [[Jean-Robert Chouet]] (1642-1731) the Cartesian, and attended the theological lectures of [[Philippe Mestrezat]], [[François Turrettini]] and [[Louis Tronchin]] ([[:de:Louis Tronchin (Theologe)|de]]) (1629-1705). In 1678-1679 he spent some time in [[Grenoble]] as tutor in a private family; on his return to Geneva he passed his examinations and received [[ordination]]. Soon afterwards he went to [[Saumur]].

In 1682 he went to [[London]], where he remained for six months, preaching on alternate Sundays in the Walloon church and in the [[Savoy Chapel]]. Due to political instability, he moved to [[Amsterdam]], where he was introduced to [[John Locke]] and to [[Philipp van Limborch]], professor at the [[Remonstrants|Remonstrant]] college. He later included Locke in the journals he edited; and the acquaintance with Limborch soon ripened into a close friendship, which strengthened his preference for the Remonstrant theology, already favorably known to him by the writings of his grand-uncle, [[Stephan Curcellaeus]] (d. 1645) and by those of [[Simon Episcopius]].

A last attempt to live at Geneva, made at the request of relatives there, satisfied him that the theological atmosphere was uncongenial, and in 1684 he finally settled in [[Amsterdam]], first as a moderately successful preacher, until ecclesiastical jealousy reportedly shut him out from that career, and afterwards as professor of philosophy, [[belles-lettres]] and Hebrew in the Remonstrant seminary. This appointment, which he owed to Limborch, he held from 1684, and in 1725 on the death of his friend he was called to occupy the chair of church history also.

Apart from literary work, Le Clerc's life at Amsterdam was uneventful. In 1691 he married a daughter of [[Gregorio Leti]]. From 1728 onward he was subject to repeated strokes of [[paralysis]], and he died 8 years later, on 8 January.

==Views==
His suspected [[Socinianism]] was the cause, it is said, of his exclusion from the chair of dogmatic theology.

==Published works==
In 1679 in Saumur were published ''Liberii de Sancto Amore Epistolae Theologicae'' (Irenopoli: Typis Philalethianis), usually attributed to Leclerc. They deal with the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], the [[Hypostatic union]] of the two natures in [[Jesus Christ]], [[original sin]], and other topics, in a manner unorthodox for the period. In 1685 he published with [[Charles Le Cène]] ''Entretiens sur diverses matières de théologie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=16260|title=Le Cène. Charles|first=Vivienne|last=Larminie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1685 he published ''Sentimens de quelques theologiens de Hollande sur l'histoire critique du Vieux Testament composée par le P. Richard Simon'', in which, while pointing out what he believed to be [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]]'s faults, he advanced views of his own. These included: arguments against the [[Moses|Mosaic]] authorship of the [[Pentateuch]]; his views as to the manner in which the five books were composed; and his opinions on the subject of [[Hierophany|divine inspiration]] in general, in particular on the [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], and [[Canticles]]. Simon's ''Réponse'' (1686) drew from Le Clerc a ''Defence des sentimens'' in the same year, which was followed by a new ''Réponse'' (1687).

In 1692 appeared his ''Logica sive Ars Ratiocinandi'', and also ''Ontologia et Pneumatologia''; these, with the ''Physica sive de rebus corporeis'' (1696), are incorporated with the ''Opera Philosophica'', which have passed through several editions. In his ''Logica'', Le Clerc rewrites the Catholic [[Port-Royal Logic|Port-Royal ''Logique'']] from a protestant Remonstrant perspective and supplements the ''Logique'' with analyses taken from ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay]]'' of his friend, [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnauld|first1=Antoine|last2=Nicole|first2=Pierre|title=La logique ou l'Art de penser|date=1662|publisher=Jean Guignart, Charles Savreux, &amp; Jean de Lavnay|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding|date=1690|publisher=Thomas Bassett|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In turn, [[Charles Gildon]] published a partial and unattributed translation of Le Clerc's ''Logica'' as the treatise "Logic; or, The Art of Reasoning" in the second (1712) and subsequent editions of John Brightland's ''Grammar of the English Tongue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gildon|first1=Charles|title=A Grammar of the English Tongue|date=1714|publisher=John Brightland|location=London|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1728, [[Ephraim Chambers]] used Gildon's translation of Le Clerc's version of the Port-Royal ''Logique'' as one of his sources when he compiled his ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=Ephraim|title=Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|date=1728|publisher=James and John Knapton, John Darby, and others|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Mills]] and [[Gottfried Sellius]] later translated Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'' into French. Their translation was appropriated by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] as the starting point for their [[Encyclopédie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|last2=d'Alembert|first2=Jean le Rond|title=Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de lettres|date=1751–1772|publisher=Briasson, David l'aîné, Le Breton, and Durand|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In particular, the article on définition (1754) in the ''Encyclopédie'' can be traced through this chain of writers, editors, translators, and compilers to the Port-Royal ''Logique'' through the ''Logica'' of Jean Le Clerc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bocast|first1=Alexander K|title=Chambers on Definition|date=2016|publisher=Berkeley Bridge Press|location=McLean|isbn=978-1-945208-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1693 his series of Biblical commentaries began with that on the [[Book of Genesis]]; the series was not completed until 1731. The portion relating to the [[New Testament]] books included the paraphrase and notes of [[Henry Hammond]]. Le Clerc's commentary challenged traditional views and argued the case for inquiry into the origin and meaning of the biblical books, It was hotly attacked on all sides.

His ''Ars Critica'' appeared in 1696, and, in continuation, ''Epistolae Criticae et Ecclesiasticae'' in 1700. Le Clerc produced a new edition of the Apostolic Fathers of Cotelerius ([[Jean-Baptiste Cotelier]], 1627-1686), published in 1698. He also edited journals of book notices and reviews: the ''Bibliothèque universelle et historique'' (Amsterdam, 25 vols, 1686-1693), begun with [[J. C. de la Croze]]; the ''Bibliothèque choisie'' (Amsterdam, 28 vols, 1703-1713); and the ''Bibliothèque ancienne et moderne'', (29 vols, 1714-1726).

Other works were Le Clerc's ''Parrhasiana ou, Pensées diverses sur des matiéres de critique, d'histoire, de morale et de politique avec la défense de divers ouvrages de M. L. C. par Théodore Parrhase'' (Amsterdam, 1699); and ''Vita et opera ad annum MDCCXI, amici ejus opusculum, philosophicis Clerici operibus subjiciendum'', also attributed to himself. The supplement to Hammond's notes was translated into English in 1699, ''Parrhasiana, or Thoughts on Several Subjects'', in 1700, the Harmony of the Gospels in 1701, and ''Twelve Dissertations'' out of 211.  Other works include the collected works of Erasmus, begun in 1703, and ''Harmonia evangelica'', 1700. One of his final works was his three-volume ''[http://data.bnf.fr/16582634/jean_le_clerc_histoire_des_provinces-unies_des_pays_bas/ Histoire des Provinces-Unies des Pays Bas]'', covering the history of the [[Dutch Republic]] up to the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] and published between 1723 and 1728.

{{broader|Latin American Bibliography}}
'''Latindex''' (Regional Cooperative Online [[Information System]] for Scholarly [[Academic journal|Journals]] from [[Latin America]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) is a bibliographical information system available for free consultation. Established as a network in 1997, the project is based on the cooperation of 17 national resource centers that operate in a coordinated scheme for the gathering and dissemination of relevant information and data on the Iberoamerican journals.

The aims of Latindex are disseminating, fostering and developing both the scientific and the editorial fields, and to fulfill their information needs in the best possible manner. Latindex was created following the recommendations arose in the First Workshop on Latin American Scientific Publications held in Guadalajara, Mexico in 1994. The idea was adopted by the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in 1995, and in February 1997, the First Technical Meeting was held in Mexico City with the commitment of four countries (Brazil, Cuba, Venezuela and Mexico). With the incorporation of Spain and Portugal in 1998, Latindex evolved towards an Iberoamerican system.

==Products==

1. '''Directory'''. It’s a Comprehensive inventory of scholarly journals. Available since 1997 it provides basic bibliographic data of each title such as publisher, contact address, subject coverage, prices, frequency, etc. The online version of the Directory contains detailed information of almost 17,000 journals from 30 countries.

2. '''Catalogue'''. Set online in March 2002. Being a subset of the Directory, it contains a selection of journals that fulfill a series of international quality criteria. Titles are classified according to a previously agreed international quality parameters such as peer review procedures, coverage in international databases, abstracts and keywords in more than one language, international editorial boards, among a total of 33 parameters for printed journals and 36 for electronic journals. The list of parameters met by every title is shown in each record. To date, more than 3,500 journals have been rated and included in this catalogue.

3. '''Electronic journals'''. Offers direct access to a growing collection of Iberoamerican online journals offering full text articles. Currently links to almost 3,000 titles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Latindex website is also a valuable resource to find up-to-date information of materials on scientific journals practices and editorial standards, useful for librarians, researchers and students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latindex.org/latindex/Documentos/guiapublicaciones.html ''Guía para publicaciones científicas''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210062420/http://www.latindex.org/latindex/Documentos/guiapublicaciones.html |date=2008-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latindex.org/latindex/Documentos/Guiabu.doc''La edición de revistas científicas: guía de buenos usos'']&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the site offers PowerPoint presentations from a number of seminars and workshops organized in several of the participant countries. The News Section presents information about events and news of the professional activities developed in the [[Library and Information Science]] field, mainly from Iberoamerica.

==Participating institutions==

The general coordination of the system is based in the Department of Latin American Bibliography, part of the Assistant Office for Information Services of the General Directorate for Libraries (DGB) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). In each participant country there is an institution responsible for the input of data to the system’s databases.

An agreement was reached between Latindex and REDIAL (European Network for Information and Documentation on Latin America) in 2005 in order to include in Latindex those journals published in Europe which content was relevant to Latin American issues.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Latindex Technical Meetings==

A total of 14 annual technical meetings have been held since 1997 to date in the different participant countries:

==Seminars and Workshops==

Latindex has organized in Latin America, a series of seminars and workshops addressed to professional editors of scholarly journals with the objective of sharing experiences and practices about publishing standards and the editor’s work.

The '''Leipzig Human Rights Award''' is an honor given by the European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA, which recognizes "efforts towards [[human rights]] and [[freedom of expression]] in the USA" and actions against what the organization refers to as "human rights violations by the [[totalitarian]] [[Scientology]]."&lt;ref name="cisar"&gt;{{cite news | last =Cisar | first =Joe |  title =Introduction from American Co-Moderator | work =Leipzig Award |    date =June 3, 2000 | url =http://www.leipzig-award.org/englisch/preisverleihung_2000.htm | accessdate =  2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 2001, the honor was known as the '''Alternative Charlemagne Award'''.&lt;ref name="cisar" /&gt;

Former [[Scientology controversy|Scientology critic]] [[Bob Minton]] received the first award in 2000.  Other notable recipients of the award include former German Federal Minister of Labor [[Norbert Blüm]], former [[Secretary of State]] of [[France]], [[Alain Vivien]] and [[Operation Clambake]] founder [[Andreas Heldal-Lund]].  [[Psychologist]] [[Margaret Singer]] was selected at the 2003 ceremony to be the 2004 Award recipient, but she died shortly thereafter and no award was given in that year.

==History==

===Formation===
Originally begun as the "Alternative Charlemagne Award," the honor was formed as a counterpoint to the [[Karlspreis|Charlemagne Award]] given to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="winkel2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Winkel   | first =Achim  |  title =Alternative Charlemagne Award for Scientology Critic from the USA  | work =Badische Neueste Nachrichten   |    date =May 31, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented in [[Aachen, Germany]], the Charlemagne Award, or Karlspreis, "honors individuals who promote democracy, human rights and the common values of Europe."&lt;ref name="singer2004" /&gt;  The original title of the Leipzig Human Rights Award was so-named as a way of criticizing the relationship between the [[Church of Scientology]] and the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]], which granted Scientology [[tax exemption]] status during Clinton's term in office.&lt;ref name="evers2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Evers    | first =Bernd   |  title =Scientology: Criticism of the Charlemagne Award for U.S. President Clinton  | work =Neue Bildpost  | pages =Nr. 23, Page 1  |   date =June 1, 2000  |  accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA was formed in 1997, and includes committee members from [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[England]], [[Austria]], [[Russia]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="freie2003" /&gt;  The Committee opposes "physical and psychological abuse of humans under the pretext of religion."&lt;ref name="freie2003" /&gt;  The organization notes that their criticism of the United States for "its failure to confront Scientology’s human rights abuses while promoting the cult around the world" has made the Award controversial, and states that all past recipients of the Award have been targeted by the Church of Scientology as [[Suppressive person]]s, and subjected to the Church's [[Fair game (Scientology)|Fair Game policy]].&lt;ref name="singer2004" /&gt;  Award recipients do not receive financial compensation as part of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Distinction for Ex-Minister Blüm  | work =[[Bild-Zeitung]]  |    date =May 31, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Leipzig Human Rights Award for French Cult Commissioner  | work =EPD Press agency|    date =May 11, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's charter cites its concern over the deaths of [[Lisa McPherson]] and [[Patrice Vic]], and states "We wish to express our support for the American people and the American government in ending human rights violations against US citizens and other people, committed by the Scientology Organization."&lt;ref name="charter"&gt;{{cite news  | last =European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA |   title =Charter | work =Leipzig Award |    date = | url =http://www.leipziger-preis.de/englisch/grundsatztext.htm  | accessdate =  2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the Leipzig Human Rights Award charter calls on the United States to reestablish "true freedom of life, speech, religion, personality and pursuit of happiness," and emphasizes [[freedom of speech]], freedom for members of an organization to leave that organization without fear of retribution, freedom from [[blackmail]] through materials obtained during spiritual counseling, and calls on the United States for full disclosure of "secret agreements" between the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name="charter" /&gt;

===Award recipients===
Bob Minton, at the time a prominent critic of Scientology, received the first award in 2000 as the Alternative Charlemagne Award.&lt;ref name="berliner2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =HONORED: Alternative Charlemagne Award to U.S. American  | work =[[Berliner Zeitung]]  |    date =June 5, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her speech at the event, [[Scientology Task Force of the Hamburg Interior Authority]] Commissioner [[Ursula Caberta]] cited Minton's recognition of "what dangers could arise for people and liberal democracy from Scientology."&lt;ref name="berliner2000" /&gt;  Minton had provided former members of Scientology with financial and legal assistance after they had left the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Robert S. Minton  | work =[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]  |    date =June 3, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the awards ceremony, Sect Commissioner of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg Thomas Gandow stated "By holding this ceremony, we intended to give a sign that, in spite of the Clinton administration, there are people in America who think differently and who do not swim with the Scientology tide."&lt;ref name="wiarda" /&gt;  Gandow cited Minton's actions as chairman of the [[Lisa McPherson Trust]] helping former members of Scientology make claims against the organization in court.&lt;ref name="wiarda" /&gt;  The Church of Scientology was critical of Minton being honored, and formed its own organization opposed to the Leipzig Human Rights Award, and on May 29, 2000 sent letters to bishops of the [[Evangelical Church Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia|Evangelical State Churches in Berlin-Brandenburg]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Saxony|Saxony]].&lt;ref name="schade2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Schade   | first =Thomas   |  title =Dispute involves millionaire Minton: A citizens committee squares off with Scientology in Leipzig and gives out the first Alternative Charlemagne Award  | work =Sächs.

Zeitung Dresden  |    date =June 3, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The awards ceremony took place at the old stock exchange in the Old City of Leipzig.&lt;ref name="taz2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Alternative Charlemagne Award: Struggling with the sect   | work =[[die tageszeitung]]  |    date =May 27, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The award given to Minton was presented as a sculpture of the [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig]], and was created by Leipzig artist Ruediger Bartels.&lt;ref name="bild2000"&gt;{{cite news | last =Staff |   title =First Alternative Charlemagne Award goes to American Scientology Critic | work =[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]] |    date =June 5, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =Staff |   title =Alternative Charlemagne Award for Robert Minton | work =Leipziger Volkszeitung  | pages =2  |   date =June 3, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The award presentation was held on June 3, 2000, one day after the presentation of the official Charlemagne Award to President Bill Clinton by Aachen Mayor [[Jürgen Linden]].&lt;ref name="wiarda"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Wiarda  | first =Jan-Martin  |  title =Scientology: Alternative Charlemagne Award for sect opponent  | work =[[Der Tagesspiegel]]  |    date =June 3, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scholz2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Scholz   | first =Ernst-Gerhardt  |  title =The new uprising for Scientology  | work =Hamburg Abendblatt  |    date =June 2, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former German Federal Minister of Labor Norbert Blüm was honored with the 2001 Leipzig Human Rights Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Human Rights Award for Blüm  | work =Bremer Nachrichten  |    date =June 10, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blüm was recognized because he had "championed human rights and religious freedom in the discussion with the totalitarian Scientology Organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Blüm receiving "Alternative Charlemagne Award 2001" Leipzig, Germany  | work =Berliner Zeitung   |    date = February 26, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Award again contained a picture of Leipzig's St. Nicholas Church, and Blüm was presented with the Award at a ceremony in Leipzig at a site near the [[Leipzig Trade Fair]] on June 10, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Norbert Blüm receives "Alternative Charlemagne Award" for human rights  | work =[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]]  |    date =February 25, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leipziger2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Blüm receives Human Rights Award in Leipzig  | work =freiepresse  |   publisher =Chemnitzer Verlag und Druck GmbH &amp; Co. KG | date =June 4, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with the ''[[junge Welt]]'' on June 11, 2001, Blüm was asked why it takes courage to be a politician critical of the Scientology, and he cited actions the Church of Scientology had taken against him: "Scientology acts on people's fears. For instance they threatened me by saying they would distribute their dossier on me to television. They've called me all kinds of names in their newspaper: the "Rasputin" of politics, for example."&lt;ref name="junge2001"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Lehmann | first = Anna |  title = "Congratulations Mr. Blüm, on your well deserved award of recognition": How should one deal with Imperialists? jW speaks with human rights award winner Norbert Blüm (CDU) | work =[[junge Welt]]  |    date =June 11, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blüm also stated in the interview that he did not support a ban on Scientology in Germany, but rather sought to foster the distribution of information about the organization.&lt;ref name="junge2001" /&gt;  He also compared what he saw as [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] similarities between the ideologies of [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], noting that he was not comparing the individuals themselves but rather their "totalitarian systems."&lt;ref name="junge2001" /&gt;  At the awards presentation, Thomas Gandow stated that Blüm was the only federal minister to date to criticize Scientology's "new totalitarianism."&lt;ref name="leipziger2001"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Friedrich | first =Andreas   |  title =Norbert Blüm receives Human Rights Award: Former federal minister honored in Leipzig for his involvement against the Scientology organization | work =Leipziger Volkszeitung  |    date =June 10, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gandow noted that Blüm had been criticized by [[Scientologist]]s in the press, and was sued in court for his actions critical of the organization.&lt;ref name="leipziger2001" /&gt;  The Scientology Church Germany, Inc. characterized the Award as a "cynical mockery of the most elementary basic rights and of the East German civil rights movement," and referred to the Awards Committee as "a dubious clan of fanatical religious discriminators."&lt;ref name="leipziger2001" /&gt;

The European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA recognized former Secretary of State of France, Alain Vivien, with the third Leipzig Human Rights Award, on May 11, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Staff |   title =Frenchman Vivien honored with Leipzig Human Rights Award  | work =DDP News Agency  |    date =May 11, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frankfurter2002"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Alain Vivien  | work =[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]  |    date =March 20, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Award was again presented in Leipzig at St. Nicholas Church, and a congratulatory speech was given by Bavaria's Interior Minister, [[Guenther Beckstein]].&lt;ref name="frankfurter2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mach2002"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Mach  | first =Marco  |  title =Leipzig honors Frenchman for his fight against cults  | work =Leipziger Volkszeitung  |    date =May 13, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Award was an image of the St. Nicholas Church, encased in glass.&lt;ref name="mach2002" /&gt;  At the time, Vivien was the President of the [[MIVILUDES|Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances]], a French [[government agency]].&lt;ref name="frankfurter2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mach2002" /&gt;  The Committee gave Vivien recognition for his work against "new totalitarian organizations", and spoke positively of his motivations which included his "aim to protect society"; Vivien was singled out for his "demonstration of public courage" while undergoing what the Committee referred to as "pressure from a new form of totalitarianism exercised by Scientology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scientology|first=James R.|last=Lewis|page=314|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=0-19-533149-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech honoring Vivien, Minister Guenther Beckstein called Vivien a "pioneer in the Scientology controversy across Europe and across the world."&lt;ref name="mach2002" /&gt;  Beckstein stated that Vivien's work demonstrated that it is possible to prevent the misuse of the word "religion" by totalitarian organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =People in the News: Alain Vivien   | work =Südwest-Presse  |    date =May 5, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his acceptance speech, Vivien stated he was pleased "to receive the award in a place from which freedom of thought has for so long emanated."&lt;ref name="mach2002" /&gt;

Operation Clambake founder Andreas Heldal-Lund became the fourth recipient of the Leipzig Human Rights Award, on May 17, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Human Rights Award for Norwegian IT specialist  | work =[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]]  |    date =May 18, 2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Anti-Scientology-site-spurs-award/2110-1025_3-999351.html|accessdate=2011-01-14|title=Anti-Scientology site spurs award|date=May 1, 2003|first=Lisa M.|last=Bowman|work=CNET News|publisher=CBS Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Clambake was cited by the Committee for exposing what it referred to as "fraud and human rights violations" of the Church of Scientology in the United States.&lt;ref name="dialog2003"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Staff |   title = Norwegian IT professional wins Leipzig Human Rights Award 2003 | work = Dialog Zentrum Berlin |    date = December 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Norwegian Internet expert receives Human Rights Award: The German Evangelical Alliance also congratulates the Scientology opponent | work =IDEA  |    date =May 6, 2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European-American Citizens Committee said it echoed a statement Heldal-Lund had written at the Operation Clambake website, where he stated: "People should be free to believe whatever they want, including Scientology," but also cited what he believed to be the organization's "deceitfulness, its lack of compassion for its members (especially the hard-working staff), its aggressive hard sell, its arrogance, its attack on free speech, its litigiousness, its harassment of its critics, its lack of concern for families, its gross neglect and abuse of children."&lt;ref name="dialog2003" /&gt;  Heldal-Lund was recognized for "maintaining his Web page despite repeated legal attacks from church officials."&lt;ref name="bowman2003"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lisa M. |last=Bowman |title=Anti-Scientology site spurs award |url=http://news.cnet.com/2110-1025_3-999351.html |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=2003-05-01 |accessdate=2007-12-04 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713030638/http://news.cnet.com/2110-1025_3-999351.html |archivedate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Church of Scientology officials had attempted to silence Heldal-Lund by requesting [[Google Inc.]] and [[Internet Archive]] remove links to Operation Clambake, claiming violation of their copyrights.&lt;ref name="bowman2003" /&gt;  The Awards ceremony again included the presentation of a glass-contained sculpture with an image of St. Nicholas Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =People in the News: Andreas Heldal-Lund / Johannes Rau  | work =[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]  | pages =Andreas Heldal-Lund (section)  |   date =May 15, 2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alain Vivien presented Heldal-Lund with the Award, and stated that his work had revealed the actions of Scientologists with "respect and intelligence."&lt;ref name="freie2003"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Staff  |   title =Leipzig Human Rights Award conferred upon Norwegian Heldal-Lund  | work =Freie Presse Chemnitz  |    date =May 18, 2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his acceptance speech, Heldal-Lund spoke about freedom of speech, and emphasized the role of the individual citizen.&lt;ref name="freie2003" /&gt;

After the 2003 Awards ceremony completed, the Committee met and selected Dr. Margaret Thaler Singer to receive the 2004 award.&lt;ref name="singer2004" /&gt;  Singer died on November 23, 2003, and as a result no award was given out in 2004.&lt;ref name="singer2004"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =  2004 Leipzig Human Rights Award: Dr. Margaret Thaler Singer | work =Prix de Leipzig |    date =2004 | url =http://www.leipzig-award.org/franzoesisch/navi_2004.html | accessdate = 2007-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European-American Citizens Committee stated: "The Committee really had no choice but to not select another award recipient for 2004, because Margaret truly is irreplaceable. We also decided not to hold a celebration this year."&lt;ref name="singer2004" /&gt;

In 1991, development of the ''Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts'' (CLCLT) started, with the aim of encompassing the entirety of Christian Latin literature. This digital database, initially released as a [[CD-ROM]], was produced by the Cetedoc, led by prof. [[Paul Tombeur]] at the [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. Since 2001, the activities of Cetedoc have been continued in Turnhout by the ''Centre ‘Traditio Litterarum Occidentalium’'' (CTLO), still led by Paul Tombeur.

When in 2002, the decision was made to expand the database's chronological scope beyond Medieval and Patristic times, its name was changed to ''Library of Latin Texts''. A further development followed in 2009. Then, a B series (LLT-B) was added to the original LLT (hence known as LLT-A). The LLT-B's scope was to accelerate the growth of the database by directly adopting the text of existing editions, without the intensive research work that is applied to the texts of the LLT-A. This work includes verifying facts related to the text and correcting errors in the printed edition.&lt;ref name="Brepolis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brepolis.net/pdf/Brepolis_LLT_EN.pdf|title=Library of Latin Texts|publisher=BREPOL&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;S|accessdate=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between the LLT and similar databases ==
Unlike similar initiatives, like [[Corpus Corporum]] or [[The Latin Library]], the LLT is not an open-access database. This allows for the adoption of copyrighted editions. In fact, while open-access initiatives have to rely on out-of-copyright, possibly outdated editions, the LLT's policy is to select texts that have "been edited according to best contemporary scholarly practice".&lt;ref name="Brepolis" /&gt;

The '''Museum of Fine Arts''' in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], is the fifth [[list of largest art museums| largest]] museum in the United States. It contains more than 450,000 works of art, making it one of the most comprehensive collections in the Americas. With more than one million visitors a year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Fine Arts Annual Report|url=http://www.mfa.org/annual-report-2015/numbers.html|website=Museum of Fine Arts|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the [[List of most visited art museums in the world| 60th most-visited art museum in the world]] {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.

Founded in 1870, the museum moved to its current location in 1909. The museum is affiliated with the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts]].

==History==

===1870–1907===
[[File:MuseumOfFineArtsBoston CopleySquare 19thc.jpg|225px|right|thumb|The original Museum of Fine Arts building in Copley Square.]]
The Museum of Fine Arts was founded in 1870 and opened in 1876, with most of its initial collection taken from the [[Boston Athenæum]] Art Gallery. [[Francis Davis Millet]], a local artist, was instrumental in starting the Art School affiliated with the museum, and in appointing [[Emil Otto Grundmann]] as its first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natasha |url=http://jssgallery.org/Other_Artists/Millet_Francis_D/Francis_D_Millet.htm |title=John Singer Sargent Virtual Gallery |publisher=Jssgallery.org |date=|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was originally located in a highly ornamented brick [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] building in [[Copley Square]] designed by [[John Hubbard Sturgis]] and [[Charles Brigham]] which was noted for its massed architectural [[terracotta]] in an American building. It was built almost entirely of brick and terracotta (imported from England), with some stone about its base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An announcement was made...|journal=The Brickbuilder|date=December 1899|volume=8|issue=12|page=237|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015084516791;view=1up;seq=445|accessdate=7 March 2015|publisher=Rodgers &amp; Manson|location=Boston, MA|format=hathitrust.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1907–2008===
In 1907, plans were laid to build a new home for the museum on [[Huntington Avenue]] in Boston's [[Fenway-Kenmore]] neighborhood, near the recently-constructed mansion that would later become the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]]. Museum trustees decided to hire architect [[Guy Lowell]] to create a design for a museum that could be built in stages, as funding was obtained for each phase. Two years later, the first section of Lowell’s [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] design was completed. It featured a {{convert|500|ft|m|sing=on}} [[façade]] of [[granite]] and a grand [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]. The museum moved to its new location later that year; the Copley Plaza Hotel eventually replaced the old building.

The second phase of construction built a wing along [[The Fens (Boston, Massachusetts)|The Fens]] to house paintings galleries. It was funded entirely by Maria Antoinette Evans Hunt, the wife of wealthy [[business magnate]] Robert Dawson Evans, and opened in 1915. From 1916 through 1925, the noted artist [[John Singer Sargent]] painted the [[fresco]]es that adorn the rotunda and the associated [[colonnades]]. 

Numerous additions enlarged the building throughout the years, including the Decorative Arts wing in 1928 (again enlarged in 1968) and the Norma Jean Calderwood Garden Court and Terrace in 1997. The West Wing, designed by [[I. M. Pei]], opened in 1981, and was renamed the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art in 2008.  This wing now houses the museum's cafe, restaurant, meeting rooms, classrooms, and a giftshop/bookstore, as well as large exhibition spaces.&lt;ref name="Architectural History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/about/architectural-history|title=Architectural History - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008–present===

[[File:Japanese gate and garden at Boston Museum of Fine Arts - August 15, 2015.jpg|right|thumb|''Tenshin-en'', the museum's Japanese garden]]
In the mid-2000s, the museum launched a major effort to renovate and expand its facilities. In a seven-year fundraising campaign between 2001 and 2008 for a new wing, the endowment, and operating expenses, the museum managed to total over $500 million, in addition to acquiring over $160 million worth of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith H.|title=Boston Museum Grows by Casting a Wide Net|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/giving/11BOSTON.html|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=The New York Times|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis|global financial crisis]] between 2007 and 2012, the museum's budget was trimmed by $1.5 million and the museum increased revenues by conducting traveling exhibitions, which included a loan exhibition sent to the for-profit [[Bellagio (resort)|Bellagio]] in Las Vegas in exchange for $1 million. In 2011, [[Moody's Investors Service]] calculated that the museum had over $180 million in outstanding debt. However, the agency cited growing attendance, a large endowment, and positive cash flow as reasons to believe that the museum's finances would become stable in the near future.

In 2011, the museum put eight paintings by Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Gauguin, and others on sale at [[Sotheby's]], bringing in a total of $21.6 million, to pay for ''Man at His Bath'' by [[Gustave Caillebotte]] at a cost reported to be more than $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;Judith H. Dobrzynski (March 14, 2012), "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/arts/artsspecial/a-fund-for-buying-art-burnishes-collections-and-reputations.html How an Acquisition Fund Burnishes Reputations]". ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Art of the Americas Wing====
The renovation included a new Art of the Americas Wing to feature artwork from North, South, and Central America. In 2006, the groundbreaking ceremonies took place. The wing and adjoining Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Family Courtyard were designed in a restrained, contemporary style by the London-based architectural firm [[Foster and Partners]], under the directorship of Thomas T. Difraia and CBT/Childs Bertman Tseckares Architects. The landscape architecture firm [[Kathryn Gustafson#Gustafson Guthrie Nichol|Gustafson Guthrie Nichol]] redesigned the Huntington Avenue and Fenway entrances, gardens, access roads, and interior courtyards.

The wing opened on November 20, 2010 with free admission to the public. Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] declared it "Museum of Fine Arts Day", and more than 13,500 visitors attended the opening. The {{convert|12,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} glass-enclosed courtyard features a {{convert|42.5|ft|adj=on}} high glass sculpture, titled the ''[[Lime Green Icicle Tower]]'', by [[Dale Chihuly]].&lt;ref name=lime&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/lime-green-icicle-tower-551953 |title=Lime Green Icicle Tower |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Art of the Americas Wing was recognized for its high architectural achievement by being awarded the [[Harleston Parker Medal]], by the [[Boston Society of Architects]].

In 2015, the museum renovated its [[Japanese garden]], Tenshin-en. The garden, which originally opened in 1988, was designed by Japanese professor Kinsaku Nakane. The garden's ''kabukimon''-style entrance gate was built by Chris Hall of Massachusetts, using traditional [[Japanese carpentry]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese Garden, Tenshin-en|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/featured-galleries/japanese-garden-tenshin-en|website=Boston Museum of Fine Arts|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.woodworkersjournal.com/chris-hall/|last1=Takes|first1=Joanna Werch|title=Chris Hall: A (Japanese-Inspired) Timber Framing Philosophy for Furniture|journal=Woodworker's Journal|date=January 20, 2015|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aerial True Orthophoto.png|thumb|This photo is assembled from several overlapping photos from UAV, completely removing any residual tilt of the buildings. This is a True Orthophoto.]]

An '''orthophoto''', '''orthophotograph''' or '''orthoimage''' is an [[Aerial photography|aerial photograph]] or image geometrically corrected ("orthorectified") such that the scale is uniform: the photo has the same lack of distortion as a map. Unlike an uncorrected aerial photograph, an orthophotograph can be used to measure true distances, because it is an accurate representation of the Earth's surface, having been adjusted for [[Topography|topographic relief]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gary S. "DIGITAL ORTHOPHOTOGRAPHY AND GIS." ESRI Conference. http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc95/to150/p124.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barrel distortion|lens distortion]], and [[camera tilt]].

Orthophotographs are commonly used in [[geographic information system]]s ([[GIS]]) as a "map accurate" background image.  An orthorectified image differs from "rubber sheeted" rectifications as the latter may accurately locate a number of points on each image but "stretch" the area between so scale may not be uniform across the image.  A [[Digital elevation model|digital elevation model (DEM)]] is required to create an accurate orthophoto as distortions in the image due to the varying distance between the camera/sensor and different points on the ground need to be corrected.  An orthoimage and a "rubber sheeted" image can both be said to have been "georeferenced" however the overall accuracy of the rectification varies.  Software can display the orthophoto and allow an operator to digitize or place linework, text annotations or geographic symbols (such as hospitals, schools, and fire stations). Some software can process the orthophoto and produce the linework automatically.

Production of orthophotos was historically achieved using mechanical devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/aerialjourneys/5320.shtml BBC Tomorrow's World: How maps are corrected and updated using aerial photography and optical machinery. 18 December 1970.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthophotomap==
[[File:7.5 minute series orthophotomap (topographic).jpg|thumb|right|Orthophotomap of [[Rockport, Texas]]. The orthophotomap contains additional roads, [[terrain]] [[elevation]] and [[bathymetry]] layers.]]
An '''orthophotomosaic''' is a [[raster image]] made by merging orthophotos — aerial or satellite photographs which have been transformed to correct for [[Perspective distortion (photography)|perspective]] so that they appear to have been taken from vertically above at an infinite distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=370 |title=Glossary of the Mapping Sciences |author= American Congress on Surveying and Mapping, American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers |year=1994 |isbn=9780784475706}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Google Earth]] images are of this type.

The document (digital or paper) representing an orthophotomosaic with additional marginal information like a title, north arrow, scale bar and cartographical information is called an '''orthophotomap''' or '''image map'''. Often these maps show additional point, line or polygon layers (like a traditional map) on top of the orthophotomosaic. A similar document, mostly used for disaster relief, is called a [[spatiomap]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4368">'''Paratext''' is a concept in [[literature|literary interpretation]].  The [[Text (literary theory)|main text]] of published authors (e.g. the story, non-fiction description, poems, etc.) is often surrounded by other material supplied by the authors, editors, printers, and publishers, which is known as the paratext. These added elements form a frame for the main text, and can change the reception of a text or its interpretation by the public. Paratext is most often associated with [[book]]s, as they typically include a cover (with associated [[cover art]]), title, [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] (dedication, opening information, foreword), [[Book design#Back matter (end matter)|back matter]] (endpapers, colophon) footnotes, and many other materials not crafted by the author. Other editorial decisions can also fall into the category of paratext, such as the formatting or typography. Because of their close association with the text, it may seem that authors should be given the final say about paratextual materials, but often that is not the case. One example of controversy surrounding paratext is the case of the 2009 young adult novel ''[[Liar (novel)|Liar]]'', which was initially published with an image of a white girl on the cover, although the narrator of the story was identified in the text as black.

The concept of paratext is closely related to the concept of [[hypotext]], which is the earlier text that serves as a source for the current text.

==Theory==
[[literary theory|Literary theorist]] [[Gérard Genette]] defines paratext as those things in a published work that accompany the text, things such as the author's name, the title, [[preface]] or [[introduction (essay)|introduction]], or [[illustration]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Genette ''Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation'' page 1&lt;/ref&gt;
Genette states "More than a boundary or a sealed border, the paratext is, rather, a threshold." It is "a zone between text and off-text, a zone not only of transition but also of transaction: a privileged place of pragmatics and a strategy, of an influence on the public, an influence that ... is at the service of a better reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it". Then quoting [[Philippe Lejeune]], Genette further describes paratext as "a fringe of the printed text which in reality controls one's whole reading of the text". This threshold consists of a peritext, consisting of elements such as titles, chapter titles, prefaces and notes. It also includes an epitext, which consists of elements such as interviews, publicity announcements, reviews by and addresses to critics, private letters and other authorial and editorial discussions – 'outside' of the text in question. The paratext is the sum of the peritext and epitext.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intertextuality|last=Allen|first=Graham|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-17475-6|location=USA and Canada|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perfectionist liberalism''' has been defined by [[Charles Larmore]] (1987) as the "family of views that base political principles on 'ideals claiming to shape our overall conception of the good life, and not just our role as citizens.'"&lt;ref name="MN"&gt;Nussbaum, M. C. (2011), "Perfectionist Liberalism and Political Liberalism." ''Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs'', 39: 3–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CL87"&gt;Larmore, Charles (1987), ''Patterns of Moral Complexity'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larmore, Charles (1996), ''The Morals of Modernity'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Raz]] popularised those ideas. Other important contemporary theorists of liberal perfectionism are [[George Sher]] and [[Steven Wall]]. One can also find liberal perfectionist strands of thought in the writings of early liberals like [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Thomas Hill Green|T.H.Green]].

Perfectionist liberalism (or liberal perfectionism - most, though not all authors use these terms synonymously) is the combination of two ideas: [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|Perfectionism]] and [[Liberalism]]. What makes perfectionist liberalism perfectionist is its embracement of an objective theory of the good life (or of human [[Well-being|well-being]]) and the belief that it is the business of the state to (sometimes) promote the good life of its citizens or (if a cosmopolitanist theory of [[Justice|justice]] is correct) to promote the good life of all human beings. What makes perfectionist liberalism liberal is that it either holds a theory of the good life that gives pride of place to the value of [[Autonomy|autonomy]] or that it holds a theory of the good life from which classical liberal rights and/or the principle of state neutrality can be derived (contingently, yet over a wide range of "close" [[Possible world|possible worlds]]), or both.

Often perfectionism is associated with [[Paternalism|paternalism]]. If the state is to promote the well-being of its citizens, so the reasoning, it also has to intervene with citizen's actions that are not conducive to their well-being. Most perfectionist liberals try to avoid this implication by showing that paternalist state action is self-defeating, i.e. they try to show that the best way for the state to promote the well-being of its citizens is to restraint itself and let each individual to strive for her good by herself. Others bite the bullet and hold that liberalism is compatible with some amount of paternalism.

Among political philosophers it is commonplace that perfectionist liberals derive political principles (that guide political action and the design of political institutions) from a theory of the good life. What is often missed is that a theory of political action is not derivable from a theory of the good life alone. Principles can only be derived from other principles. It is therefore of critical importance that liberal perfectionists commit themselves not only to a theory of the good life but also to a theory of [[Distributive justice|distributive justice]]. [[Utilitarianism]], [[Egalitarianism]], [[Sufficientarianism]] and [[Prioritarianism]] are the standard candidates when it comes to principles of distribution.
 
For Raz, at the centre of his perfectionist liberalism are ''autonomy'' and ''moral pluralism'' and the approach can be contrasted with ''political liberalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, Joseph (1987), "Autonomy, Toleration, and the Harm Principle", in ''Issues in Contemporary Legal Philosophy'', edited by Ruth Gavison, Oxford University Press, pp. 313–33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum]] (2011) notes that elsewhere Larmore (1997) argues that "these views involve controversial ideals of the good life, or views about 'the ultimate nature of the human good.'"

For Nussbaum, ''perfectionist liberalism'' "is a species of a genus of liberal views that might be called “comprehensive liberalisms”" as opposed to "political" or "[[Public reason|public]]" liberalisms. All perfectionist liberalisms are therefore comprehensive while not all comprehensive liberalisms are perfectionist. An eminent case of a comprehensive, yet non-perfectionist liberal theory is Lockean [[Libertarianism|libertarianism]], which is build on the ideal of self-ownership rather than on a conception of the good life. For Nussbaum "liberalisms that base political principles on some comprehensive doctrine about human life" cover "not only the political domain but also the domain of human conduct generally."&lt;ref name="MN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CL87"/&gt;. Furthermore, they depart from non-comprehensive (i.e. political or public reason) liberalism in grounding their political principles in a theory of the good (life), while the latter takes an allegedly "neutral" stance which is supposed to be compatible with all kinds of (reasonable) theories of the good (life).

Following the work of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]] outlined the workings of a '''political consciousness'''.

==The politics of consciousness==
[[Consciousness]] typically refers to the idea of a being who is self-aware.  It is a distinction often reserved for human beings.  This remains the original and most common usage of the term.  &lt;ref&gt;But a line of political and philosophical inquiry opened up which explores consciousness in terms of one's  political state of mind.&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, consciousness describes a person's political sense of self.  That is, consciousness describes a person's awareness of politics.  For Marx, an authentic consciousness was linked to understanding one's true position in History.  While Hegel placed God behind the workings of consciousness in people, Marx saw the [[political economy]] as the engine of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/o.htm |title=Glossary of Terms: Co |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, many social movements and intellectuals have developed this use of consciousness.

==False consciousness==
{{Main|False consciousness}}
In Marx's view, consciousness was always political, for it was always the outcome of politic-economic circumstances.  What one thinks of life, power, and self, for Marx, is always a product of ideological forces.

For Marx, ideologies appear to explain and justify the current distribution of wealth and power in a society.  In societies with unequal allocations of wealth and power, ideologies present these inequalities as acceptable, virtuous, inevitable, and so forth.  Ideologies thus tend to lead people to accept the status quo.  The subordinate people come to believe in their subordination: the peasants to accept the rule of the aristocracy, the factory workers to accept the rule of the owners, consumers the rule of corporations. This belief in one's own subordination, which comes about through ideology, is, for Marx, [[false consciousness]].

That is, conditions of inequality create ideologies which confuse people about their true aspirations, loyalties, and purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm ''The German ideology'', Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for example, the [[working class]] has often been, for Marx, beguiled by nationalism, organized religion, and other distractions.  These ideological devices help to keep people from realizing that it is they who produce wealth, they who deserve the fruits of the land, all who can prosper: instead of literally thinking for themselves, they think the thoughts given to them by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm ''The Communist Manifesto'', ch. 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consciousness and the political-economy==

For Marx, consciousness is a reflection of the political economy.  A person's thoughts tend to be shaped by his or her political and economic circumstances.  He famously wrote, "It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness."

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Perhaps Marx's greatest contribution to modern thought... is his comprehensive investigation into the role of Ideology, or how social being determines consciousness, which results in certain (for the most part unconscious) belief and value systems depending on the particular economic infrastructure pertaining at the time. From a Marxian point of view all cultural artifacts--religious systems, philosophical positions, ethical values--are, naturally enough, products of consciousness and as such are subject to these ideological pressures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/philosophy/phil2.html Sullivan, Robert. The Victorian Web]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Consciousness and social movements==

Many [[social movements]] have loosely followed Marx's thinking on consciousness.  Attaining consciousness, many believe, means finding one's ''true'' historical path, as opposed to the propaganda dispensed by the ruling elites.  Thus, the [[feminist movement]] spoke of [[consciousness raising]] and many South African activists have subscribe to a [[Black Consciousness Movement]], which calls upon Blacks to pursue their "true" political trajectory (as opposed to the ideas set out by, for example, the [[apartheid]] regime).  In the latter example, for many South African Blacks, consciousness meant rejecting racist ideas about Blacks, rejecting White rule of the nation, and restoring Black identity, history, and power.

In a politically charged sense, becoming "politically conscious" is often meant to connote that people have awakened to their ''true'' political role, their ''actual'' identity.  For Marx, this meant that the working classes would become conscious of themselves as the agents of history--they would unite and share in the wealth of labor.  This, for Marx, was their historical role and their right (as opposed to working for wages, fighting wars on behalf of capitalists, and so forth).  For many African Americans, "consciousness" has meant identifying and discrediting forms of [[White supremacy]], including those internalized by Blacks.  In these uses of the term "consciousness" is truth or destiny.  These uses of political consciousness are often politically charged.  Does, for example, a Black woman lack consciousness because she generally supports a system run mostly by White male capitalists?  If she became politically conscious would she think differently?  What is her "true" consciousness supposed to look like?

Many marxists, feminists, African Americans (and other groups), have ceased to argue that there is one true form of consciousness.  Instead, while preserving a sense that the ruling class perpetuates a [[dominant ideology]] and often behaves in ways which harm people, many dissenters now hold a more liberal position which tolerates a variety of political positions.  The complexities of political consciousness are described by the theories of [[cultural hegemony]].

'''''Portrait Miniature of Margaret Roper''''' is a painting by the German artist and printmaker [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] created between 1535–36, and today held in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name="met1"&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/margaret_more_1505_1544_wife_of_william_roper_hans_holbein_the_younger/objectview.aspx?collID=11&amp;OID=110001105 Margaret More]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved on 17 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Roper]] (1505–44) was the eldest child of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] and wife of the English biographer [[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]]. It is the second and less well known of two portraits of Roper painted by Holbein. The first, ''Portrait of an English Woman'', is generally believed to show Roper but may depict another unknown lady of the English court. The New York work was painted during the artist's second visit to London, likely in the mid-1530s.&lt;ref name="G92"&gt;Goldberg, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/h/hans_holbein_the_younger,_port.aspx Hans Holbein the Younger, Portrait of an English Woman, a drawing]". [[British Museum]], Retrieved 11 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the work was created shortly after her father's beheading at the hands of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1535.&lt;ref name="mm12"&gt;"[http://12.151.120.44/toah/ho/08/euwb/ho_50.69.2.htm Margaret More (1505–1544), Wife of William Roper, 1535–36]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved on 17 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; With a diameter of just {{convert|1+3/4|in|cm}}, the work was one of over a hundred [[Portrait miniature|miniature]]s and portraits painted by Holbein while in England. This work is one of a pair of [[pendant]]s; the second depicts the sitter's husband.

Roper is depicted in three-quarters view with a narrow face and wearing extravagant clothes that reflect her social position. She is wearing a [[gable hood]] with pinned up red/orange embroidered lappets (facing the viewer) and a long black veil (with one side pinned up). Her black gown is lined with a broad band of fur. She holds a green book in her hands which are decorated by gold rings. A horizontal gold inscription reads "Ao ÆTATIS XXX".&lt;ref name="met1" /&gt; The work was donated to the Metropolitan Museum by the Rogers Fund in 1950.

'''Recontextualisation''' is a process that extracts text, signs or meaning from its original context (decontextualisation) in order to introduce it into another context. Since the meaning of texts and signs depend on their context, recontextualisation implies a change of meaning, and often of the communicative purpose too. The [[linguist]] Per Linell defines recontextualisation as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''the dynamic transfer-and-transformation of something from one discourse/text-in-context ... to another.''&lt;ref&gt;Linell 1998: 154&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Linell distinguishes between recontextualisation at three different levels:
* '''intratextual:''' recontextualisation within the same text, discourse or conversation. Intratextual recontextualisation plays an important part in most discourse in so far as it refers to what have been said before, or anticipates what is to be said. In conversation, for instance, the one part usually infuses what the other part just – or earlier – has said in a new context thus adding new meaning to it. Such turns of decontextualisation and recontextualisation combined with metadiscursive regulation are crucial for the continual unfolding of texts, discourses and conversations.&lt;ref&gt;Blommaert 2005: 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''[[intertextuality|intertextual]]:''' recontextualisation relations to specific texts, discourses or conversations. It is an important aspect of texts that they explicitly or implicitly fetch elements from other texts. The importance of this becomes clear when it is realised the meaning of a word is based on its meaning in other contexts; it could be an encyclopaedia, but more often its meaning stems from contexts in which it is used.
* '''[[interdiscourse|interdiscursive]]:''' recontextualisation between types of discourse, such as genres. In Fairclough, chains of genres is closely connected to interdiscursive recontextualisation. Chains of genres denotes how genres depend on each other's discursive material, e.g. the relation between interviews, transcription of interviews and the analysis of interviews. However, interdiscursive recontextualisation is also abundant between large interdiscursive entities or formation and is part of society's discursive workshare. An example is the import of results from statistic theory into social science with the purpose of testing quantitative analyses.
Though recontextualisation often is used within linguistics, it also has interdisciplinary applications. Particularly, in [[Basil Bernstein]]'s concept of the pedagogic device that consists of three fields: the fields of production, recontextualisation and reproduction. The field of reproduction is the field of schooling institutions. The field of production is the field, where knowledge is produced (often universities). The field of recontextualisation mediates between these two fields. The recontextualisation field "is composed of two sub-fields; namely, the official recontextualising field (ORF) and the pedagogic recontextualising field (PRF). The ORF consists of 'specialized departments and sub-agencies of the State and local educational authorities'. The PRF consists of university departments of education, their research as well as specialised educational media.

Rhetorical scholar John Oddo argues that recontextualization has a future-oriented counterpoint, which he dubs "precontextualization".&lt;ref&gt;Oddo 2013; 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oddo, precontextualization is a form of anticipatory intertextuality wherein "a text introduces and predicts elements of a symbolic event that is yet to unfold."&lt;ref&gt;Oddo 2014: 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times. 2008. March 29.]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[professor]], [[Poetry of the United States|poet]], and [[Academia|academic]], best known for his many [[translation]]s of [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and Roman [[classics]], especially his acclaimed translations of the [[Epic poetry|epic poems]] of [[Homer]]. He taught English and [[comparative literature]] for many years at [[Princeton University]].

==Life==
Fagles was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], the son of Charles Fagles, a lawyer, and Vera Voynow Fagles, an architect. He attended [[Amherst College]], graduating in 1955 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]]. The following year, he received his [[master's degree]] from [[Yale University]]. On June 17, 1956, he married Marilyn (Lynne) Duchovnay, a teacher, and they had two children. In 1959, Fagles received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in English from Yale and for the next year taught English there.

From 1960 to 1962, Fagles was an English instructor at Princeton University. In 1962 he was promoted to [[Assistant Professor]], and in 1965 became an [[Associate Professor]] of English and comparative literature. Later that year he became director of the comparative literature program. In 1970, he became a full professor, and from 1975 was the department chair. He retired from teaching as the Arthur W. Marks '19 Professor of Comparative Literature in 2002, and remained a professor emeritus at Princeton.

Between 1961 and 1996, Fagles translated many ancient Greek works. His first translation was of the poetry of [[Bacchylides]], publishing a complete set in 1961. In the 1970s, Fagles began translating much [[Greek drama]], beginning with [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[The Oresteia]]''. He went on to publish translations of [[Sophocles]]'s [[three Theban plays]] (1982), Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' (1990) and ''[[Odyssey]]'' (1996), and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' (2006). In these last four, [[Bernard Knox]] authored the introduction and notes. Fagles' translations generally emphasize contemporary [[English language|English]] phrasing and [[idiom]] but are faithful to the original as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/03/28/20597/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704142424/http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/03/28/20597/ |date=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Fagles published ''I, Vincent: Poems from the Pictures of [[Vincent Van Gogh|Van Gogh]]''. He was the co-editor of ''Homer: A Collection of Critical Essays'' (1962) and ''[[Alexander Pope|Pope]]'s Iliad and Odyssey'' (1967).

Fagles died at his home in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]], on March 26, 2008, from [[prostate cancer]].

==Awards==
Fagles was nominated for the [[National Book Award#Translation|National Book Award in Translation]] and won the [[Harold Morton Landon Translation Award]] of the [[Academy of American Poets]] in 1991 for his translation of the ''Iliad''. In 1996, he received an [[Academy Award in Literature]] from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] for his translation of the ''Odyssey''. In 1997 he received the [[PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal]] for lifetime achievement in translation.  Fagles later undertook a new English translation of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which was published in November 2006.

In addition to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Fagles was also a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]].

He received a [[National Humanities Medal]] by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/national-humanities-medals/robert-fagles |title=Robert Fagles: Awards &amp; Honors: 2006 NAtional Humanities medalist |publisher=[[National Endowment for the Humanities]] |year=2012 |accessdate=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2011, a resource center devoted to the study of the Classics was dedicated to Dr. Fagles at [[Princeton High School (New Jersey)|Princeton High School]].  At the dedication, students and teachers paid tribute to Dr. Fagles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allprinceton.com/content/dedication-fagles-resource-center-studies-classics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402232811/http://allprinceton.com/content/dedication-fagles-resource-center-studies-classics |date=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Morse Edsel'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/big-name-movies-added-to-sxsw-lineup-texas-arts-st/nRWhZ/ | title = Big-name movies added to SXSW lineup; Texas arts stars honored; L | work = statesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born December 28, 1956) is an American businessman and author.  He has written three non-fiction books - ''[[Rescuing Da Vinci]]'' (2006),  ''[[Monuments Men]]: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History'' (2007); and ''Saving Italy'' (2013) - chronicling the recovery of artwork stolen by Nazi Germany during [[World War II]]. A film based on his book, ''[[The Monuments Men]],'' directed by and starring Academy Award winner [[George Clooney]], was released in February 2014.

Edsel is the co-producer of the Emmy-nominated documentary film, ''The Rape of Europa'' (2007). He is also founder and Chairman of the [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art]], which received the 2007 National Humanities Medal under President [[George W. Bush]]. The foundation has donated four albums of photographic evidence of the [[Third Reich]]'s theft of art treasures to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|United States National Archives]].

==Early life and education==
Robert M. Edsel was born in 1956, in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], and raised in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324030704578424750585179628 | title = He Drills for Answers | author = Joanne Kaufman | date = May 1, 2013 | work = WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of Norma Louise (née Morse), a housewife, and Alpha Ray Edsel, a stockbroker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rapeofeuropa.com/aboutTheCreators.asp | title = The Rape of Europa – About Creators of the Film | work = rapeofeuropa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E4D8163AF931A15752C0A96E9C8B63 | work = The New York Times | title = Paid Notice: Deaths EDSEL, ALPHA RAY (RAY) | date = January 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edsel was formerly a nationally ranked tennis player.

In 1981, he began his business career in oil and gas exploration. His company, Gemini Exploration, pioneered the use of [[horizontal drilling]] technology throughout the early 1990s. Gemini Exploration grew from a company of eight employees to almost 100. By 1995, Gemini had become the second most active driller of horizontal wells in the United States. Edsel sold the company’s assets to Union Pacific Resources Company, and the following year, he moved to Europe with his family.

In the late 1990s, while living in [[Florence]], Edsel began to think about the methods and planning used to keep art out of the hands of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Following a divorce in 2000, Edsel moved to [[New York City]], where he began a serious effort to learn about and understand the issue.

By 2004, those efforts had become a full-time career, and he established a research office in [[Dallas]], his hometown.&lt;ref name="gijoe" /&gt;  By 2005, he had gathered thousands of photographs and other documents, and began writing the manuscript for ''[[Rescuing Da Vinci]]'', which was published in 2006. The book received wide attention.&lt;ref name="gijoe"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kennedy | first = Randy | title = G.I.

In September 2009, Edsel’s second book, ''[[The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History]]'', a narrative account of the Monuments Men, was published by Center Street, a division of [[Hachette Book Group]]. The book has been translated and published in more than 25 languages. [[George Clooney]] wrote, directed and starred in a movie of the same name based on Edsel's book, ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' (2014).

Edsel's third book, entitled ''[[Saving Italy: The Race to Rescue a Nation's Treasures from the Nazis]]'' (2013), was published by W. W. Norton and debuted on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list. ''Saving Italy'' tells the dramatic story of the Monuments Men's efforts to locate and recover that country’s innumerable art treasures that had been stolen by the Nazis. Beginning with the near destruction of [[Leonardo Da Vinci]]’s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' by British bombing, Edsel introduces a major but largely overlooked Nazi figure, SS General [[Karl Wolff]]. Edsel describes Wolff's harrowing negotiations with OSS leader [[Allen Dulles]], America’s senior spy in Europe, related to the artworks and preserving Paris after the Nazis' retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Italy-Rescue-Nations-Treasures/dp/0393082415 | title = Saving Italy: The Race to Rescue a Nation's Treasures from the Nazis: | last = Edsel| first =Robert M. | isbn=9780393082418| publisher=Center Street | work = amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edsel co-produced a documentary film, ''[[The Rape of Europa (book)|The Rape of Europa]]'' (2007), based on [[Lynn Nicholas]]' eponymous book. Narrated by [[Joan Allen]], the film was well received by critics and began a theatrical run in September 2007 at the [[The Paris Theater (Manhattan)|Paris Theatre]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Scheib | first = Ronnie | author2 = Variety Staff | title = The Rape of Europa | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = January 31, 2007 | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932640.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 | accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Saltz | first = Rachel | title = Art, Lost &amp; Found | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = September 14, 2007 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/movies/14euro.html?ref=arts | accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Edsel has created ''The Greatest Theft in History''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.greatesttheft.com | title = The Monuments Men – Official Site | work = greatesttheft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; educational program, which includes the two-hour documentary film and seven hours of additional clips, as well as a companion website featuring lesson plans, glossaries, timelines, and other resources to enable teachers to easily use this material in the classroom.

==Monuments Men Foundation==
[[File:Bush 2007 National Humanities Medal.jpg|thumb|left|Edsel with President [[George W. Bush]] and four Monuments Men.]]

In 2007, Edsel created the [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art]]. The foundation's mission is "to preserve the legacy of the unprecedented and heroic work of the men and women who served in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (“MFAA”) section, known as “Monuments Men,” during World War II, by raising public awareness of the importance of protecting and safeguarding civilization’s most important artistic and cultural treasures from armed conflict, but incorporating these expressions of man's greatest creative achievements into our daily lives." He announced the foundation's creation during a ceremony on June 6, 2007, the 63rd anniversary of [[D-Day]], to celebrate [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House]] concurrent resolutions honoring the Monuments Men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = H.Con.Res 48 | work = thomas.loc.gov | publisher = [[Library of Congress]] | date = January 31, 2007 | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/C?c110:./temp/~c110vfeVIa | accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = S.

The Monuments Men Foundation was one of ten recipients of the 2007 [[National Humanities Medal]], an honor which was presented by President Bush during a ceremony held in the East Room of The White House on November 15, 2007. The National Humanities Medal is the highest honor given for excellence in the Humanities field.

==Photograph albums==
[[File:NARA shaking hands.jpg|thumb|[[Archivist of the United States]] [[Allen Weinstein]] with Edsel after the donation of Nazi photograph albums.]]

During the course of their research into the whereabouts of lost art, Edsel and the staff of the Monuments Men Foundation discovered four large, leather-bound photograph albums which documented portions of the European art looted by the Nazis. The albums were in the possession of heirs to an American soldier stationed in the [[Berchtesgaden]] area of Germany, in the closing days of World War II.

The albums were created by the staff of the Third Reich’s ''[[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]]'' (ERR), a special unit that found and confiscated the best material in Nazi-occupied countries, to use for exploitation. In [[France]], the ERR engaged in an extensive and elaborate art looting operation, part of Hitler’s much larger premeditated scheme to steal art treasures from conquered nations. The albums were created for Hitler and high-level Nazi officials as a catalogue and, more importantly, to give Hitler a way to choose the art for his art museum in [[Austria]]. A group of these photograph albums was presented to Hitler on his birthday in 1943, to "send a ray of beauty and joy into [his] revered life."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} ERR staff stated that nearly 100 such volumes were created during the years of their art looting operation.

In November 2007, at a ceremony with [[Archivist of the United States]] [[Allen Weinstein]], Edsel announced the discovery of the first two photograph albums and, separately, donated the albums to the [[National Archives]].  Weinstein called the discovery "one of the most significant finds related to Hitler’s premeditated theft of art and other cultural treasures to be found since the [[Nuremberg trials]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = National Archives Announces Discovery of "Hitler Albums" Documenting Looted Art | publisher = [[National Archives and Records Administration]] | date = November 1, 2007 | url = https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2008/nr08-22.html | accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2014, Edsel received the Records of Achievement award from the [[Foundation for the National Archives]], for "'bringing to life the storied history of the men and women' who served in the [[Monuments Men]]...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/michael-granberry/20141029-national-archives-honors-dallas-author-robert-edsel.ece | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141029180107/http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/michael-granberry/20141029-national-archives-honors-dallas-author-robert-edsel.ece | date = October 29, 2014 | archivedate = October 29, 2014 | last = Granberry | first = Michael | website = The Dallas Morning News | title = GuideLIVE: National Archives honors Dallas author Robert Edsel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spitting Image''''' was a British [[satire|satirical]] television [[puppet show]], created by [[Peter Fluck]], [[Roger Law]] and [[Martin Lambie-Nairn]]. The series was produced by 'Spitting Image Productions' for [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]] over 18 series which aired on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. The series was nominated and won numerous awards during its run including ten [[BAFTA Television Awards]], one for editing in 1989 and two [[Emmy|Emmy Awards]] in 1985 and 1986 in the Popular Arts Category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British TV scoops Emmys |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=26 November 1986 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series featured puppet [[caricature]]s of [[celebrities]] prominent during the 1980s and 1990s, including British Prime Ministers [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]] and other politicians, US president [[Ronald Reagan]], and the [[British Royal Family]]; the series was the first to caricature [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] (as an elderly gin-drinker with a [[Beryl Reid]] voice).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26329273 "Spitting Image creator John Lloyd: 'Television lacks satire'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403132129/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26329273 |date=3 April 2015 }}. BBC. Retrieved 2 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most-watched shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the series was a satire of politics, entertainment, sport and [[British culture]] of the era, and at its peak it was watched by 15 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/arts/pictures/0,,1444231,00.html?redirection=gallery "Spitting Image"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118084335/https://www.theguardian.com/arts/pictures/0,,1444231,00.html?redirection=gallery |date=18 January 2017 }}. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 2 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The series was cancelled in 1996, after viewing figures declined. ITV had plans for a new series in 2006, but these were scrapped after a dispute over [[Ant &amp; Dec]] puppets used to host ''Best Ever Spitting Image'', which were created against Roger Law's wishes.&lt;ref name="digitalspy.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a39486/ant-and-dec-stunt-ends-spitting-image-return.html|title=Ant and Dec stunt ends 'Spitting Image' return|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=17 November 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912082824/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a39486/ant-and-dec-stunt-ends-spitting-image-return.html|archivedate=12 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Law donated his entire archive – including original scripts, puppet moulds, drawings and recordings – to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name=“archives”&gt;{{cite news |title=Spitting Image archives donated to Cambridge University |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-46143333 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Grantham Museum Thatcher Spitting Image.jpg|thumb|right|Puppet of [[Margaret Thatcher]] on display in [[Grantham Museum]]]]
[[Martin Lambie-Nairn]] proposed a satirical television show featuring caricature puppets created by [[Peter Fluck]] and [[Roger Law]]. Fluck and Law, who had both attended the [[Anglia Ruskin University|Cambridge School of Art]], had no previous television experience, but had, for several years, constructed plasticine caricatures in order to illustrate articles in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Magazine.

The idea for the series was rejected by many in the industry, who thought it would only be suitable for children, but the series was finally accepted for development and first broadcast in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TV bosses rejected ''Spitting Image'' as 'kid's stuff' before hit show aired |first=Roya |last=Nikkhah, |date=18 November 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9685029/TV-bosses-rejected-Spitting-Image-as-kids-stuff-before-hit-show-aired.html |work=The Telegraph |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424020930/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9685029/TV-bosses-rejected-Spitting-Image-as-kids-stuff-before-hit-show-aired.html |archivedate=24 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English comedy writer and ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' editor [[Tony Hendra]], was brought in as a writer; Fluck and Law had met him while they were working in the US. Hendra brought in [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]], producer of ''[[Not The Nine O'Clock News]]''. They were joined by [[Jon Blair]], a documentary producer. They then hired [[Muppet]] puppeteer [[Louise Gold]]. Development was funded by [[Clive Sinclair]].

The puppets, based on public figures, were designed by Fluck and Law, assisted by caricaturists that included [[David Stoten]], Pablo Bach, [[Steve Bendelack]] and [[Tim Watts (filmmaker)|Tim Watts]]. The episodes included musical parodies by [[Philip Pope]] (former member of ''[[Who Dares Wins (TV comedy)|Who Dares Wins]]'' and [[The Hee Bee Gee Bees]]) and later [[Steve Brown (composer)|Steve Brown]].

The first episode of ''Spitting Image'', in 1984, aired with a [[laugh track]], apparently at the insistence of Central Television. This episode was shown to a preview audience before transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Latex Lampoonery (Spitting Image Giveaway Special, Part 1) |first=Mark |last=Jones |url=http://broken-tv.blogspot.com/2009/11/latex-lampoonery-spitting-image.html |work=Broken TV |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130711205149/http://broken-tv.blogspot.com/2009/11/latex-lampoonery-spitting-image.html |archivedate=11 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the show, ''Spitting Image'' was filmed and based in the enterprise zone at [[London Docklands]] at the [[Limehouse Studios]], where scriptwriters convened and puppets were manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://isleofdogslife.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/spitting-images-the-story-of-limehouse-television-studios/|title=Spitting Images – The Story of Limehouse Television Studios|date=2013-03-25|work=Isle of Dogs Life|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110114711/https://isleofdogslife.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/spitting-images-the-story-of-limehouse-television-studios/|archivedate=10 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/trm.61804.044|title=The Railway Metropolis|date=2016-01-01|publisher=ICE Publishing|isbn=0727761803|pages=44–53|doi=10.1680/trm.61804.044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressionist [[Steve Nallon]] recalls that "they were able to get away with no health and safety, so all of the building of the puppets with all the toxic waste from the foam was just in a warehouse. There were no extractor fans; it was quite Dickensian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview: Steve Nallon #2 – 'Comedians are all lunatics' |date=28 September 2013 |url=http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2013/09/interview-steve-nallon-2-comedians-are-all-lunatics/ |work=Giggle Beats |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928143948/http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2013/09/interview-steve-nallon-2-comedians-are-all-lunatics/ |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later series, ''Spitting Image'' was recorded at Central's studios in [[Nottingham]] with last minute additions being recorded at the [[Limehouse Studios]] at [[Canary Wharf]], London.

==Reception==
Before the first episode was broadcast, the parodies of the Royal Family were cut, as a courtesy to the Duke of Edinburgh, who opened the East Midlands television centre a few days later. The scenes were however all reinstated in later episodes.&lt;ref name="royalcut"&gt;{{cite news |title=Royal Family cut from TV satire |newspaper=The Times |date=25 February 1984 |page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first episode had an audience of 7.9 million, but numbers rapidly dropped, which meant economies had to be introduced since the series cost [[Pound sterling|£]]2.6 million, which was nearly double the price of other prime time series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spitting Image and Beyond |url=http://members.madasafish.com/~openbanana/puppets/page15.htm |work=The World of Puppets |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002171602/http://members.madasafish.com/~openbanana/puppets/page15.htm |archivedate=2 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series had been scheduled to have 13 episodes&lt;ref name="royalcut"/&gt; but was cut back to 12, after the series was nearly cancelled. [[Rob Grant]] and [[Doug Naylor]] were then brought in as head writers to save the show.

By 1986, under their supervision, ''Spitting Image'' had become popular, producing a number one song on the [[UK Singles Chart]] ("[[The Chicken Song]]"). However, Grant and Naylor subsequently left to create ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' for BBC2. ''Spitting Image'' had a short-running dispute with the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) in 1985, over the use of subliminal images.

===Evolution===
When [[Margaret Thatcher]] resigned as both Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party in November 1990, her successor was [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[John Major]]. This marked a shift in the show's style, with the writers moving from the Punch and Judy style to more subtle and atmospheric sketches, notably a series in which an awkward Major and wife Norma ate peas for dinner. The producers dressed Major, skin and all, in shades of grey, and invented an affair between him and [[Virginia Bottomley]].

The show added animated sketches from 1989 and again from 1994 (with short, animated segments before 1989). For the 1992 Election Special, a studio audience was used; this format was revisited for two episodes in late 1993. A spoof ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' took questions from the audience. The 1992 show was fronted by a puppet [[Robin Day]], a puppet [[Jeremy Paxman]] filling the role in the episodes broadcast on 14 November 1993 and 12 December 1993.

The writers, [[Mark Burton (writer)|Mark Burton]], [[John O'Farrell (author)|John O'Farrell]], Pete Sinclair, Stuart Silver, and Ray Harris quit the show in 1993 and in 1995, and with viewing figures in decline, production was cancelled.  The final series was in January and February 1996, with the final episode featuring "The Last Prophecies of Spitting Image" in which Labour moved into [[Number 10 Downing Street|Number 10]].

A few years later, most of the puppets were sold at an auction hosted by [[Sotheby's]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 July 2000 |title=Online sale for TV puppets |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/823080.stm |work=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030102044311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/823080.stm |archivedate=2 January 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a puppet of [[Osama Bin Laden]] never used in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 November 2001 |title=Spitting Image to auction bin Laden |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1672791.stm |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2004, the idea of the series coming back started to appear after John Lloyd held talks with ITV executives about the show's return. John Lloyd also held talks with a number of people who voiced the ''Spitting Image'' puppets, including John Sessions, Harry Enfield and Rory Bremner, with all responding positively.

Mr Lloyd commented, "There's enormous enthusiasm from ITV to do it. We're just trying to work out how it would be affordable. The budget is about to go off to ITV," he said. "Everybody seems to have residual affection for Spitting Image. It could be scrappy and uneven, but it's rather like a newspaper. You don't expect it to be brilliant every time, but there's something delicious in every edition," Mr Lloyd said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spitting Image back to haunt Blair |first=SUZY |last=AUSTIN |work=Metro |date=18 May 2004 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-303251/Spitting-Image-haunt-Blair.html#ixzz2cXP7k4sM |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130820235637/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-303251/Spitting-Image-haunt-Blair.html%23ixzz2cXP7k4sM#ixzz2cXP7k4sM |archivedate=10 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spitting Image plans TV comeback |first=Jason |last=Deans |work=MediaGuardian |date=17 May 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/17/broadcasting.uknews |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529231058/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/17/broadcasting.uknews |archivedate=29 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2006, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] were producing a documentary celebrating the series and if the audience figures were good a full series might have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Politicians beware!

This special actually prevented ITV directly resurrecting the famous satire as they had planned, because it featured new puppets of [[Ant and Dec]] &amp;ndash; a move which was against the wishes of Roger Law, who owns the rights to the ''Spitting Image'' brand.&lt;ref name="digitalspy.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spitting Image return scuppered by Ant'n'Dec |first=Scott |last=Matthewman |date=16 November 2006 |url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/11/spitting-image-return-scuppered-by-antndec/ |work=The Stage |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129004827/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/11/spitting-image-return-scuppered-by-antndec/ |archivedate=29 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spitting Image'', as ITV's primary satirical programme, was succeeded by ''[[2DTV]]'', a cartoon format that had five series between 2001 and 2004. In 2008 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] created a CGI version to caricature and lampoon the famous, called ''[[Headcases]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ITV to make CGI version of Spitting Image |date=17 May 2007 |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/old_story/191/ |work=British Comedy Guide |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924014840/http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/old_story/191/ |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it only aired for one series. Satirical puppets finally returned to ITV in 2015, in ''[[Newzoids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3030671/William-Kate-s-puppet-makeover-Duke-Duchess-Cambridge-royals-set-lampooned-ITV-s-newest-comedy-sketch-show.html|title=Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to be lampooned in ITV's Newzoids - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online|accessdate=1 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150410113436/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3030671/William-Kate-s-puppet-makeover-Duke-Duchess-Cambridge-royals-set-lampooned-ITV-s-newest-comedy-sketch-show.html|archivedate=10 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==

In April 2017, it was reported that US broadcaster [[HBO]] was set to revive the series in light of the [[presidency of Donald Trump]]. As of the report, no official confirmation or announcement was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/news/2543/spitting_image_usa/|title=HBO to make Spitting Image series|date=22 April 2017|work=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=15 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021551/https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/news/2543/spitting_image_usa/|archivedate=16 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archive donated to Cambridge University==
In 2018, ''Spitting Image'' co-creator Roger Law donated his entire archive – which includes original scripts, puppet moulds, drawings and recordings – to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. The collection is located in the university library, with its librarian Dr Jessica Gardner describing the collection as a "[[national treasure]]".&lt;ref name=“archives”/&gt; She added, "Spitting Image was anarchic, it was creative, it entered the public imagination like nothing else from that era. It is an extraordinary political and historical record. Great satire holds up a mirror, it questions and challenges."&lt;ref name=“archives”/&gt;

==Broadcast dates==
All episodes and specials were broadcast on Sunday, usually at 10pm. The programme was also picked up overseas. It aired on Canada's [[CBC Television]] on Sunday nights in the late 1980s.  The American network [[NBC]] aired several prime-time specials in the same period. Austrian public broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] broadcast ''Spitting Image'' in English with German subtitles late on Friday nights in approximately four-week intervals in the late 1980s and early 1990s, introducing it to the German-speaking world (where foreign programming is usually dubbed into German). ''Spitting Image'' was also briefly shown in France on the private TV channel [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]] in English with French subtitles. The show was also aired in New Zealand on [[TVNZ]] in the 1980s.

==Repeats==
From October 1996 to September 1998, ''Spitting Image'' Series 1-11 were on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UK Gold]], until September 1998. Edited episodes from Series 1-3 and 7 were on [[Plus (TV channel)|Granada Plus]] from 2001-2003.

In February 2008, [[Comedy Central Extra]] started showing regular repeats of ''Spitting Image'' from 9pm on Tuesday evenings, with a whole weekend's worth of evenings devoted to the first two series. It reappeared in a late night slot in November 2010, through to 18 December 2010 and has not been aired since then. From 2001 to 2004 the ITV series ''[[2DTV]]'' had a similar style, but using computer animation instead of puppets.

The programme is rebroadcast on the digital network "PuppeTV" as a part of its "Puppets After Dark" post - watershed slot. In 2011, the network dedicated an entire month to broadcasting all episodes of the show, from 10:00pm until 6:00am, including the 2006 clipshow special and the American specials, which they called "Spitting Image 24/7". 

===United States version===
{{See also |List of British TV shows remade for the American market |D.C. Follies}}
In an attempt to crack the American market, there were some attempts to produce a [[television in the United States|US version]] of the show. A 45-minute 'made for market' show by the original ''Spitting Image'' team, titled ''Spitting Image: Down and Out in the White House'' was produced in 1986 by Central for the [[NBC]] network.

Introduced by [[David Frost]], it departed from the sketch-based format in favour of an overall storyline involving the upcoming (at that time) Presidential election. The plot involved a conspiracy to replace Ronald Reagan with a double (actually actor [[Dustin Hoffman]] in disguise). This plan was hatched by the Famous Corporation, a cabal of the ultra-rich headed by [[Johnny Carson]]'s foil [[Ed McMahon]] (in the show, Carson was his ineffectual left-hand man) who met in a secret cavern hollowed out behind the façade of Mount Rushmore. Eventually, their plot foiled, the famous corporation activated their escape pod &amp;ndash; Abraham Lincoln's nose &amp;ndash; and left Earth for another planet, but (in a homage to the beginning of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies) were destroyed during a collision with 'a nonsensical prologue in gigantic lettering'.

The show was not very successful with its target audience, possibly because its humour was still very British and it was so irreverent about Ronald Reagan at a time when he was enormously popular with the American public. It did, however, receive great praise from critics and it was followed by several more television specials: ''The Ronnie &amp; Nancy Show'' (also satirising the Reagans), ''The 1987 Movie Awards'' (sending up the [[Academy Awards]]), ''Bumbledown: The Life and Times of Ronald Reagan'' (a quasi-documentary about the President), and ''The Sound of Maggie'' (satirising Thatcher and parodying several musicals such as ''[[Oliver!]]'', ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' and many others).

==Characters==

===Politicians===
Many British politicians in parliament during [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s tenure were parodied.&lt;ref name=“archives”/&gt; By far the most prominent was Thatcher herself, portrayed as an abusive tyrant and cross-dresser (she wore suits, shaved, used the urinals, was portrayed as a cigar-chomper and addressed by her Cabinet as "Sir"). The Thatcher puppet had a strong dislike of anything French (agreeing with Hitler about 'teaching those Frenchies where to go' and throwing an apple out of the window because it was French).

In the first series, Thatcher sought advice from her enraptured neighbour Herr Jeremy Von Wilcox (who is actually an elderly Adolf Hitler, living at 9 Downing Street) about the unions and the unemployed. Mr. Wilcox/Hitler compares the [[Trade unions]] with the [[Soviet Union]] and advises [[Operation Barbarossa#Weather|not to attack in winter]]. Regarding unemployment, he says that people out of work should be put in the army, and tells Thatcher that he thinks the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] (meaning [[Special Air Service|SAS]]) are a "great bunch of guys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Spitting Image |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2DnW5uC1_A |accessdate=18 April 2013 |series=3 |credits= |network=ITV |year=1986 |number=1 |minutes=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523161940/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2DnW5uC1_A |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Thatcher were her Cabinet, which included:

*[[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|Willie Whitelaw]], with fluffy eyebrows and wearing a tartan dressing gown to cabinet meetings.
*[[Nigel Lawson]], panicking about a financial crisis he had apparently caused. A real-life recession caused Lawson to step down in 1989. He is by far the worst of all the cabinet being completely unable to count to seventeen.
*[[Geoffrey Howe]], boring, bland and talked to [[sheep]].
*[[Douglas Hurd]], famous for his [[Dalek]]-style voice and his hair shaped like a "[[Mr Whippy]]" ice cream. Hurd seems also the most competent and humane one in the cabinet. Opposing the usage of torture and stopping the dumping of nuclear waste in Scotland&lt;ref&gt;''Comedy Connections: Spitting Image''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Norman Tebbit]], appearing as a leather-clad [[skinhead]] loyal to Thatcher, referring to her as "Leader" and often beating up other politicians.&lt;ref name="doc" /&gt;
*[[Michael Heseltine]], growing more manic with every series (and wearing a flak jacket as Defence Secretary).
*[[Leon Brittan]], constantly fawning towards Thatcher and often seen eating.
*[[Norman Fowler]], portrayed during his time as Health Secretary as a hospital-murdering [[Jack the Ripper]]-style lunatic.
*[[Cecil Parkinson]], having a sexual interest in every woman he sees.
*[[Edwina Currie]], portrayed as a vampire.
*[[Paul Channon]], childish.
*[[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]], transforming into a slug over the series.
*[[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], smoking and developing the countryside for houses.
*[[Kenneth Clarke]], obese and drunk despite being Minister for Health.
*[[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]], spineless wimp
*[[David Waddington, Baron Waddington|David Waddington]], Fast talking and creepy
*[[Francis Pym]] and [[James Prior]], Wets who swam in swimming pools
*[[Colin Moynihan, 4th Baron Moynihan|Colin Moynihan]], minuscule and childlike, called "miniature for sport"
*[[Tom King, Baron King of Bridgwater|Tom King]], portrayed while Employment Secretary as [[The Invisible Man]]

Thatcher's Cabinet were often depicted as bickering schoolchildren, with Thatcher acting as teacher.

Thatcher's successor [[John Major]] was portrayed as a dull, boring grey character who enjoyed a meal of peas with his wife [[Norma Major|Norma]] and was constantly mocked by [[Humphrey (cat)|Humphrey]], the [[Downing Street]] cat. Before Thatcher's resignation, Major had been portrayed as wearing a leopard print suit and swinging in on a trapeze, referencing his background as the son of a circus acrobat (which he would frequently remind everyone about). Upon his appointment to Prime Minister, Major was initially portrayed as robotic with a spinning antenna on his head (it was explained in a sketch that Thatcher used it to control Major, standing behind Thatcher in the crowd of sycophantic cabinet members, eager to repeat whatever the Thatcher puppet screeched).

The [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]) politicians included:

*[[Neil Kinnock]], the 'Welsh Windbag', talking for hours about anything ''other'' than policies.
*[[Roy Hattersley]], spitting with every word because of his lisp (on 'Best Ever Spitting Image', Hattersley praised his puppet for 'putting the spit into ''Spitting Image''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/roy-hattersley-wife-divorce-after-1827552 |first=Ben |last=Rossington |title=Roy Hattersley and wife divorce after 57 YEARS |work=Daily Mirror |date=12 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218235030/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/roy-hattersley-wife-divorce-after-1827552 |archivedate=18 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Michael Foot]], aged and senile, ending sentences with "Yes! Argh!".
*[[Tony Benn]], a rampant socialist with eyes that never looked in the same direction.
*[[Ken Livingstone]], whose living room was filled with salamanders and snakes.
*[[Denis Healey]], with giant eyebrows, who helped to make Kinnock look foolish (the real Healey appeared in the programme in 1984).
*[[Gerald Kaufman]], portrayed as a [[Hannibal Lecter]]-style maniac.

[[Arthur Scargill]], who was a member of the Labour Party until 1997, appeared as head of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], and was portrayed as a big-nosed egotist who was ignorant about mining.

In 1994, a puppet of [[Tony Blair]] made his appearance. He was originally a public school boy, wearing grey shorts, blazer and cap. His catchphrase was "I'M THE LEADER" in reference to his attempt to lead the Labour Party. When Blair did become Labour leader, the puppet changed and he was portrayed with his grin replaced with an even bigger smile if he said something of importance. The deputy leader, [[John Prescott]], was portrayed as a fat bumbling assistant, along with a squeaky voiced [[Robin Cook]], and an enormous glasses-wearing [[Jack Straw]].

The [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] was portrayed by the election-losing, [[populism|populist]], arrogant and undecided [[David Owen]], with whining, bedwetting [[David Steel]] in his pocket.  They were soon replaced by [[Paddy Ashdown]], whose "equidistance" from the larger parties was satirised by his frequent appearance at the side of the screen during unrelated sketches, saying: "I am neither in this sketch nor not in it, but somewhere in-between". This running gag was used when Ashdown's extramarital affair was revealed, and his puppet commented that "I didn't touch her on the left leg, or the right leg, but somewhere in-between." Former liberal MP [[Cyril Smith]] also made a few appearances depicted as morbidly obese.

Former Prime Ministers [[Harold Wilson]], [[James Callaghan]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Alec Douglas-Home]] were depicted as living in a highly restrictive retirement home named Exchequers, where they were frequently abused by [[Queen Victoria]]. Wilson constantly attempted escape, whilst Callaghan took delight in tormenting him. [[Edward Heath]] was also said to have resided there, but he was not seen on screen.

===Royal Family===
The main characters were:
*[[Elizabeth II|The Queen]]: wears a [[CND]] badge, always seemed slightly mad and picked clothes from rubbish bins
*[[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]], the Queen's husband; was a [[blunderbuss]]-toting Greek-obsessed buffoon in [[Royal Navy|naval]] uniform
*[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] was a pseudo-hippie, then a taxi driver in later episodes
*[[Diana, Princess of Wales]] was a publicity-hungry [[Sloane Ranger]]
*[[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], who was generally seen with a bottle of [[Gordon's Gin]], a copy of the ''[[Racing Post]]'', and a [[Beryl Reid]] voice; this was a running joke from a sketch in which the Royal Family's desire to conceal her [[Birmingham]] accent was the reason she was very seldom heard speaking on television. In the series she is seen with [[jockey]] [[Lester Piggott]] with whom she has an affair.

Other members who were parodied include: [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], [[Sarah, Duchess of York|The Duchess of York]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]], [[Princess Michael of Kent]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]], who was always tipsy.

===International politicians===
Spitting Image lampooned [[President of the United States of America|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] as a bumbling, [[nuclear weapon|nuke]]-obsessed fool in comparison with his advisors [[Edwin Meese]] and [[Caspar Weinberger]]. Next to his bed were red buttons labelled 'Nuke' and 'Nurse'. His wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] was the butt of [[cosmetic surgery]] jokes.

[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had his forehead birthmark in the shape of hammer and sickle. All other Russians looked like [[Leonid Brezhnev]], often said "da" ("yes") and talked about [[potato]]es. In Russia it was snowing even indoors and the Soviet television had extremely low-tech visual effects.

[[François Mitterrand]] was wearing a beret and a garlic wreath. [[P. W. Botha]] was shown as a racist cleverly disguising his views (once he had a badge "anti-anti-[[apartheid]]"). [[Adolf Hitler]] incognito had a house at [[9 Downing Street]]. Some appearances were also made by [[Idi Amin]], [[Robert Mugabe]], [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand]] and [[Imelda Marcos]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Muammar Gaddafi]].

Other international caricatures included [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Kissinger]]; [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Dan Quayle]]; [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Konstantin Chernenko]], [[Raisa Gorbachova]] and [[Boris Yeltsin]].

===Sport===

[[File:Spitting Image Puppet of Eric Cantona (2956625432).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Puppet of Manchester United striker [[Eric Cantona]]]]
England manager [[Bobby Robson]] was a senile worrier nicknamed 'Rubbisho'. England midfielder [[Paul Gascoigne]] appeared, frequently crying – a parody of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] semi-final against West Germany in which he famously cried after being booked, which would have ruled him out of the final had England won the game.

[[Ian Botham]] was a violent drug addict, while [[Mike Gatting]] spoke with a high voice. [[Lester Piggott]] had to be subtitled. Boxing characters included [[Frank Bruno]] with his trademark laugh and catchphrase "where's [[Harry Carpenter|'Arry]]?", and [[Chris Eubank]], with his lisp. Snooker player [[Steve Davis]] was boring, upset because he had no nickname, but thought himself interesting.

===Celebrities===
News reporters were also depicted. [[Alastair Burnet]] was sycophantic towards the Royal Family and with a nose that inflated. [[Sandy Gall]] was effeminate, always worrying what coat he would wear. [[John Cole (journalist)|John Cole]] was incomprehensible and had to be dragged off-screen when he talked too long. [[Nicholas Witchell]] was always turning up during a strike to work rather than report. [[Kate Adie]] was a thrill-seeker, [[BBC]] Head of Bravery. [[Jeremy Paxman]] appeared as uninterested and self-loving. [[William Rees-Mogg]] was portrayed as a censorship-crazy person with eyes that would frequently pop out of the socket.

[[David Coleman]] had a very loud ear prompter and sometimes did not know what he was commentating on. [[Frank Bough]] was portrayed as being a drug user. [[Bruce Forsyth]] spoke every sentence as though it was a [[catchphrase]]. Film critic [[Barry Norman]] was not a fan of his puppet, because it had a [[wart]] on its forehead.&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;''Best Ever Spitting Image:'' TV Documentary.

Writer and MP [[Jeffrey Archer]] appeared as an annoying, self-commenting writer whose books were not read by anyone. [[Alan Bennett]] was shown at home as watching ''Spitting Image'' on TV.

A [[Mick Jagger]] character seemed perpetually high, and [[Keith Richards]] so old and haggard that he thought he was dead.

[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] changed her hair and clothes with every episode, and [[Michael Jackson]]'s skin turned lighter.

[[John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]] appeared in various background roles often as a bar tender.

==The songs==
[[File:SpittingImage albumcover.jpg|thumb|Spitting Image album cover for "Da Do Run Ron" satirical parody of [[Ronald Reagan]]|200px]]

The first single from ''Spitting Image'', released in 1984, was a rework of the [[The Crystals|Crystals]]' "[[Da Doo Ron Ron]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/e9713|title=45cat - Spitting Image - Da Do Run Ron / Just A Prince Who Can't Say No - Elektra - UK - E 9713|work=45cat.com|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Spitting Image'' version, "Da Do Run Ron", was a spoof election campaign song for [[Ronald Reagan]], featuring [[Nancy Reagan]] listing reasons why "you gotta re-elect him", with lyrics like "Yeah! He can really act, Yeah! He lowered income tax, Yeah! He hates the [[Warsaw Pact]]". The cover of the single featured Reagan as a biker with Nancy riding pillion.

The B-side of this single was entitled "Just A Prince Who Can't Say No" and poked fun at the sexual indiscretions of [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Prince Andrew]]. The TV version of this song (featured in the second ever episode) was heavily censored by Central Television on broadcast but presented uncut on vinyl.&lt;ref name="dadorunron"&gt;[http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/Da_Do_Run_Ron.htm Da Do Run Ron] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208152013/http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/Da_Do_Run_Ron.htm |date=8 December 2008 }} on {{cite web |url=http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611092139/http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/ |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the television series he was shown surrounded by various famous women including [[Joan Collins]], [[Mary Whitehouse]] and [[Linda McCartney]].

In 1986, the ''Spitting Image'' puppets had a number one hit in the UK charts with "[[The Chicken Song]]", parodying "[[Agadoo]]" by [[Black Lace (band)|Black Lace]] – one of several parodies to have featured in the programme, mimicking moronic holiday songs with an annoyingly unforgettable tune and completely nonsensical lyrics. The Chicken Song hit number 1 in the charts for 3 weeks from 17 May 1986 – 3 June 1986 and VH1 US named it as one of the worst number 1 nominations.

The other songs released by ''Spitting Image'' were "[[I've Never Met a Nice South African]]" (which was on the B-Side of "The Chicken Song" and was a savage indictment of the [[apartheid]]-ridden country), "We're Scared Of Bob" (a parody of "[[We Are The World]]") and "Hello You Must Be Going" (which mocked [[Phil Collins]]'s divorce ballads and was on the 12" release of The Chicken Song), "Santa Claus Is On The Dole" (backed with "The Atheist Tabernacle Choir"), "The Christmas Singles" and "Cry Gazza Cry" (based on footballer [[Paul Gascoigne]]'s tears in the 1990 World Cup), "Meat" (A parody of "[[Streets of London (song)|Streets of London]]").

"The Chicken Song" was by far the most successful of all of their music and not-so-subtle references were made to it in subsequent sketches in the show itself. In 1986, a compilation LP "Spit In Your Ear" was produced, featuring some of their sketches over time along with a few of their songs, followed in 1990 by "20 Great Golden Gobs", a songs-only collection from the 1986-1990 series.

In 1986, the ''Spitting Image'' team experienced some real musical success when they created the video for "[[Land of Confusion]]" by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], a song which implied that Thatcher and Reagan were about to bring the world to a nuclear war. [[Phil Collins]] saw a disfigured version of himself on the show and contacted the show's producers with the idea to produce the video. Three new puppets were created depicting all members of Genesis (including a less exaggerated version of Collins), which also appear on the sleeve of the 45 (and later CD) single. The video was depicted as a nightmare Reagan was having, which left him completely immersed in sweat from worrying. It won a 1987 Grammy Award.

The end of the 1987 election featured a young boy, dressed as a city banker, singing "[[Tomorrow Belongs To Me]]", a parody of the film ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'', when a member of the [[Hitler Youth]] starts singing the same song.  In a series 5 episode, Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock]] is portrayed singing a self-parody to the tune "My eyes are fully open" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Ruddigore]]'', supported by members of his shadow cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1rJW2P2rFY "Neil Kinnock in Spitting Image - Series 5"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218094259/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1rJW2P2rFY |date=18 February 2016 }}, 1988, YouTube, uploaded 26 March 2009, accessed 16 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In one instance [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was persuaded to sing a re-worded version of "[[Every Breath You Take]]", titled "[[Every Bomb You Make]]" (series 1, episode 12), to accompany a video showing the ''Spitting Image'' puppets of world leaders and political figures of the day, usually with the figure matching the altered lyrics "''Every bomb you make. Every job you take. Every heart you break, every Irish wake. I'll be watching you. Every wall you build, Every one you've killed, Every grave you've filled, all the blood you've spilled, I'll be watching you.''" The video ended with the [[grim reaper]] appearing in front of a sunset. This version was due to be resurrected by Sting at the [[Live 8]] concert, and the parody lyrics were cleared with their writers Quentin Reynolds and James Glen, but plans were abandoned at the last minute.

The end theme of series 8 episode 3 all the characters performing the tribute song [[Jeremy Beadle]] and they sang about they hated him until his death in 2008. The end theme of series 9 episode 4 was "[[Why Can't Life Be Like Hello?]]", sung by [[June Brown]] (commonly known as the EastEnders character [[Dot Cotton]]).&lt;ref&gt;Spitting Image (series 9, episode 4): {{bulleted list| {{cite web| url= http://ftvdb.BFI.org.UK/sift/title/486696?view=synopsis| title= SPITTING IMAGE: SPITTING IMAGE[03/05/92] (1992)| accessdate= 24 January 2013| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140202170556/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/486696?view=synopsis| archivedate= 2 February 2014| df= dmy-all}}| {{cite web| url= http://GoodSeri.es/shows/spitting-image/seasons/9| title= Season 9 : Spitting Image| accessdate= 24 January 2013| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140201231740/http://goodseri.es/shows/spitting-image/seasons/9| archivedate= 1 February 2014| df= dmy-all}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The song pastiches [[Hello (magazine)|''Hello'' magazine]], in satire of post-[[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] UK [[consumerist culture]].

Other musical parodies featured [[Mick Jagger]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[The Monkees]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Brett Anderson]] of [[Suede (band)|Suede]], [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Björk]], [[East 17]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].

==Video and DVD releases==
The programme was first released on video in 1986 in a series of three collections, each a compilation of material from the first two series: ''Spit - With Polish!'', ''A Floppy Mass Of Blubber'' &amp; ''Rubber Thingies''. All carried a 15 certificate and were reissued in 1988, also as a box set.  1989 saw the release by Central Video of two complete specials, ''Bumbledown: The Life &amp; Times Of Ronald Reagan'' and ''The Sound Of Maggie''. Next was a video containing a collection of the music videos from the programme, titled "The Klassik Music Video Vol 1", released in 1991 by Central Video under The Video Collection Ltd (VCI or 2entertain); there was never a Volume 2.

"Is Nothing Sacred?" was released in 1992 by Surprise Video, compiling material from 1990-1991. The free booklet was written by [[Stewart Lee]] and [[Richard Herring]]. ''Havin' It Off: The Bonker's Guide'' was released in 1993. In 1996 ''FA to Fairplay'' was released on VHS, later reissued on DVD in 2005. Made specially for video, it provided an alternative look at the 1996 European [[football (soccer)|football]] championship held in England.

The Ronald Reagan song "Da Do Run Ron" featured in a straight to video release called ''Rockin' Ronnie'' (1986), an otherwise unrelated compilation of movie clips released by ATI Video.

The first twelve series including An 11-disc set (containing the first 7 series broadcast 1984-89) have been released by [[Network Distributing]] under licence by [[ITV Studios]], so far. Series 1-7 individual releases are now deleted .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkdvd.net/product_info.php?products_id=539|title=Spitting Image: The Complete Series 1|publisher=Network DVD|accessdate=7 December 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213122120/http://www.networkdvd.net/product_info.php?products_id=539|archivedate=13 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD releases do not include any of the specials made.

:''Not to be confused with [[Journal of Phonetics]] founded in 1973''
[[Image:The-Phonetic-Journal.png|thumb|right|200px|Cover of Volume 35 of ''The Phonetic Journal'' (1876)]]
'''''The Phonetic Journal''''' stylized as '''''The Phonetic Journal.''''' was the official journal of The Phonetic Society based at the Kingston Buildings in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]], England and is the first ever journal about phonetics. It was published subtitled as ''Published Weekly, Devoted to the Propagation of Phonetic Shorthand, and Phonetic Reading, Writing and Printing.''

It was printed starting 1841 by [[Isaac Pitman]], and published by F. Pitman at the Phonetic Depot, at 20, [[Paternoster Row]], in London. The journal was initially in 12 small pages plus a 4-page advertising and information wrapper per issue. It published materials in traditional spelling as well as in [[Phonemic orthography|phonetic spelling]], and [[Pitman shorthand|phonetic shorthand]]. It also included news of the Phonetic Society and its members.

==The Phonetic Alphabet==
The journal promoted ''The Phonetic Alphabet''. It explained the alphabet promoted as "consisting of 36 letters, namely the 23 useful letters of the common alphabet (c, q and x being rejected) and 13 new letters included. The vowels a, e, i, o, u were used for their short sound as in pat, pet, pit, pot and put and all the other letters having their usual signification". 

A proposed order of the alphabet was as follows:

Consonants: p, b; t, d; ç, j; k, g; f, v; [th], [dh], s, z; ʃ, ʒ; m, n, ŋ; l, r; w, y; h.

Vowels: a, ɐ; e, ɛ; i, [ee]; o, [o]; γ, σ; u, ɥ.

Diphthongs: ei &lt;small&gt;(as in by)&lt;/small&gt;, iu &lt;small&gt;(as in new)&lt;/small&gt;, ou &lt;small&gt;(as in now)&lt;/small&gt;, ai &lt;small&gt;(as in ay)&lt;/small&gt;, oi &lt;small&gt;(as in ay)&lt;/small&gt;.

The alphabet also included 9 "foreign sounds", 7 from French and 2 from German.

===Further contributions for a proposed alphabet===
Isaac Pitman, the founder of the journal published ''Phonotypy'' in 1844, his major work on spelling reform just three years after the founding of the journal. Pitman and [[Alexander John Ellis]], an English mathematician and philologist jointly proposed in 1845 an [[English Phonotypic Alphabet]] made up of 40 letters based mainly on the Phonetic Alphabet of ''The Phonetic Journal'' and that of ''The Phonotypic Journal''. Furthermore, in a book edited in 1848, under the title ''A Plea for Spelling Reform'', by Alexander John Ellis, edited by Isaac Pitman, the authors compiled a series of articles from ''The Phonetic Journal.'' and from other periodicals, recommending an enlarged alphabet and "A Reformed Spelling of the English Language" as a "means of placing the arts of Reading and Writing within the reach of all who speak the English language or wish acquire it", as Pitman said in the intro.

'''''Time Team Live''''' is a British [[television program|television series]] that airs on [[Channel 4]].  The first programme was shown in 1997 and the most recent was in 2006. Presented by the [[actor]] [[Tony Robinson]], this is a live version of the [[archaeology]] series ''[[Time Team]]'', showing more of what happens in real time, than when the cut-down episode airs on Channel 4.

==Background==
''Time Team Live'' episodes came from historically important sites. Instead of showing a 'best of' show, the live episodes were broadcast whilst the digs were actually taking place. Later, regular episodes were made from the best of the live episodes. Normally, regular sites were recorded in the same method, however, only a few were selected for live broadcast. The regular episodes were either a special, or a normal series episode.

[[File:Faience Plate Melograno.jpg|thumb|right|Tin-glazed (Majolica/Maiolica) plate from [[Faenza]], Italy]]

'''Tin-glazed pottery'''&lt;ref&gt;''Maiolica'', [[C. Drury E. Fortnum]], 1875, p.12“&lt;/ref&gt; is [[earthenware]] covered in [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] containing [[tin oxide]] which is white, shiny and opaque (see [[tin-glazing]] for the chemistry); usually this provides a background for brightly painted decoration.  It has been important in [[Islamic pottery|Islamic]] and European [[pottery]], but very little used in East Asia. The pottery body is usually made of red or buff-colored [[earthenware]] and the white glaze imitated [[Chinese porcelain]].  The decoration on tin-glazed pottery is usually applied to the unfired glaze surface by brush with metallic oxides, commonly [[cobalt oxide]], [[copper (II) oxide|copper oxide]], [[iron oxide]], [[manganese dioxide]] and [[antimony]] oxide.  The makers of Italian tin-glazed pottery from the late [[Renaissance]] blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings.

The earliest tin-glazed pottery appears to have been made in [[Iraq]] in the 9th century, the oldest fragments having been excavated during the [[First World War]] from the palace of [[Samarra]] about fifty miles north of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=Caiger1973&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Tin-glazed Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware'' (Faber and Faber, 1973) {{ISBN|0-571-09349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From there it spread to Egypt, Persia and Spain before reaching [[Italy]] in the [[Renaissance]], [[Holland]] in the 16th century and [[England]], [[France]] and other European countries shortly after.

The development of white, or near white, firing bodies in Europe from the late 18th century, such as [[creamware]] by [[Josiah Wedgwood]], and icreasingly cheap [[Porcelain#European porcelain|European porcelain]] and [[Chinese export porcelain]], reduced the demand for tin-glaze [[Delftware]], [[faience]] and [[majolica]].

The rise in the cost of tin oxide during the First World War led to its partial substitution by [[zirconium]] compounds in the glaze.

==Names==
[[File:Chinese white ware and Iraqi earthenware bowls 9th 10th century both found in Iraq.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[porcelain]] white ware bowl, not tin-glazed (left), found in [[Iran]], and Iraqi tin-glazed earthenware bowl (right) found in [[Iraq]], both 9-10th century, an example of [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery]]. [[British Museum]].]]
Tin-glazed pottery of different periods and styles is known by different names.  The pottery from Muslim Spain is known as ''[[Hispano-Moresque ware]]''. The decorated tin-glaze of Renaissance Italy is called ''[[maiolica]]'', sometimes pronounced and spelt ''majolica'' by English speakers and authors. When the technique was taken up in the Netherlands, it became known as ''[[delftware]]'' as much of it was made in the town of [[Delft]]. Dutch potters brought it to England in around 1600, and wares produced there are known as ''[[English Delftware|English delftware]]'' or ''galleyware''. In France it was known as ''[[faience]]''.

The word ''maiolica'' is thought to have come from the medieval Italian word for [[Majorca]], an island on the route for ships that brought Hispano-Moresque wares to Italy from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, or from the Spanish ''obra de Mallequa'', the term for lustered ware made in Valencia under the influence of Moorish craftsmen from Malaga. During the Renaissance, the term ''maiolica'' was adopted for Italian-made [[lusterware|luster pottery]] copying Spanish examples, and, during the 16th century, its meaning shifted to include all tin-glazed earthenware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/ceramics-m-is-for-maiolica-majolica/ Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their identical names, there has been some confusion between tin-glazed majolica/maiolica and the lead-glazed majolica made in England and America in the 19th century, but they are different in origin, technique, style and history. In the late 18th century, old Italian tin-glazed maiolica became popular among  the British, who referred to it by the anglicized pronunciation ''majolica''. The [[Mintons Ltd|Minton]] pottery copied it and applied the term ''majolica ware'' to their product. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, Minton launched the colorful [[lead-glazed earthenware]] which they called ''[[Palissy ware]]'', soon also to become known as ''majolica''. So now we have two distinct products with the same name. "In the 1870s, the curators of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] returned to the original Italian 'maiolica' with an 'i' to describe all Italian tin-glazed earthenware, doubtless to stress the Italian pronunciation and to avoid confusion with contemporary majolica."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/ceramics-m-is-for-maiolica-majolica/  Victoria and Albert Museum, "Ceramics - M is for Maiolica/majolica"]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the article about 19th century lead-glazed earthenware, see [[Victorian majolica]]''

W.B. Honey (Keeper of Ceramics at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], 1938–1950) wrote of ''maiolica'' that, "By a convenient extension and limitation the name may be applied to all tin-glazed ware, of whatever nationality, made in the Italian tradition … the name faïence (or the synonymous English 'delftware') being reserved for the later wares of the 17th Century onwards, either in original styles (as in the case of the French) or, more frequently, in the Dutch-Chinese (Delft) tradition."&lt;ref name=Honey&gt;Honey, W.B., ''European Ceramic Art'', 1952&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''maiolica'' is sometimes applied to modern tin-glazed ware made by studio potters.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The New Maiolica'' by Matthias Osterman.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hispano-Moresque ware==
{{main|Hispano-Moresque ware}}

[[File:hispanomoresque.JPG|thumb|right|A Hispano-Moresque dish, approx 32cm diameter, with Christian monogram "IHS", decorated in cobalt blue and gold luster.  Valencia, c. 1430–1500.  [[Burrell Collection]]]]
The [[Moors]] introduced tin-glazed pottery to Spain after the conquest of 711.

Hispano-Moresque ware is generally distinguished from the pottery of Christendom by the Islamic character of its decoration,&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt; though as the dish illustrated shows, it was also made for the Christian market.

Hispano-Moresque shapes of the 15th century included the ''[[albarello]]'' (a tall jar), luster dishes with [[Coat of Arms|coats of arms]], made for wealthy Italians and Spaniards, jugs, some on high feet (the ''citra'' and the ''grealet''), a deep-sided dish (the ''lebrillo de alo'') and the eared bowl (''cuenco de oreja'').

With the Spanish conquest of [[Mexico]], tin-glazed pottery came to be produced in the Valley of Mexico as early as 1540, at first in imitation of the ceramics imported from [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;Lister&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Moors were expelled from Spain in the early 17th century, the Hispano-Moresque style survived in the province of Valencia.  Later wares usually have a coarse reddish-buff body, dark blue decoration and luster.

==Maiolica==
{{main|Maiolica}}

[[File:albarello.JPG|thumb|right|An albarello (drug jar) from Venice or Castel Durante, 16th century.  Approx 30cm high.  Decorated in cobalt blue, copper green, antimony yellow and yellow ochre.  [[Burrell Collection]]]]The 15th-century wares that initiated maiolica as an art form were the product of a long technical evolution, in which medieval lead-glazed wares were improved by the addition of tin oxides under the initial influence of Islamic wares imported through Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Goldthwaite, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Such archaic wares&lt;ref&gt;Blake&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes dubbed ''proto-maiolica''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse&lt;/ref&gt;  During the later 14th century, the limited palette of colors was expanded from the traditional manganese purple and copper green to embrace cobalt blue, antimony yellow and iron-oxide orange. ''Sgraffito'' wares were also produced, in which the white tin-oxide slip was decoratively scratched to produce a design from the revealed body of the ware.

Refined production of tin-glazed earthenware made for more than local needs was concentrated in central Italy from the later 13th century, especially in the ''contada'' of [[Florence]].  The city itself declined in importance in the second half of the 15th century, perhaps because of local [[deforestation]]. Italian cities encouraged the start of a new pottery industry by offering tax relief, citizenship, monopoly rights and protection from outside imports.  Production scattered among small communes&lt;ref&gt;Galeazzo Cora (1973) noted kilns dispersed at Bacchereto (a center of production from the fourteenth century), Puntormo, [[Prato]] and [[Pistoia]], none of them site-names that have circulated among connoisseurs and collectors.&lt;/ref&gt; and, after the mid-15th century, at [[Faenza]], [[Arezzo]] and [[Siena]]. Faenza, which gave its name to [[faience]], was the only fair-sized city in which the ceramic industry became a major economic component.&lt;ref&gt;Goldthwaite p.14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bologna]] produced lead-glazed wares for export.  [[Orvieto]] and [[Deruta]] both produced ''maioliche'' in the 15th century.  In the 16th century, maiolica production was established at [[Castel Durante]], [[Urbino]], [[Gubbio]] and [[Pesaro]].  Some maiolica was produced as far north as [[Padua]], [[Venice]] and [[Turin]] and as far south as [[Palermo]] and [[Caltagirone]] in Sicily.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rackham, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century [[Savona]] began to be a prominent place of manufacture.

Some of the principal centers of production (e.g. [[Deruta]] and [[Montelupo Fiorentino|Montelupo]]) still produce maiolica, which is sold in quantity in Italian tourist areas.

==Delftware==
{{main|Delftware}}

Delftware was made in the Netherlands from the 16th to the 18th centuries. The main period of manufacture was 1600-1780, after which it was succeeded by white stoneware and porcelain.

The earliest tin-glazed pottery in the Netherlands was made in Antwerp in 1512. The manufacture of painted pottery may have spread from the southern to the northern Netherlands in the 1560s. It was made in Middleburg and Haarlem in the 1570s and in Amsterdam in the 1580s.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;  Much of the finer work was produced in Delft, but simple everyday tin-glazed pottery was made in such places as Gouda, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Dordrecht.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

The [[Guild of St. Luke]], to which painters in all media had to belong, admitted ten master potters in the thirty years between 1610 and 1640 and twenty in the nine years 1651 to 1660. In 1654 a gunpowder explosion in Delft destroyed many breweries, and, as the brewing industry was in decline, their premises became available to pottery makers.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

From about 1615, the potters began to coat their pots completely in white tin glaze instead of covering only the painting surface and coating the rest with clear glaze. They then began to cover the tin glaze with a coat of clear glaze which gave depth to the fired surface and smoothness to [[cobalt]] blues, ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do after the death of the Emperor [[Wan-Li]] in 1619, when the supply to Europe was interrupted.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt; Delftware inspired by Chinese originals persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

Delftware ranged from simple household items to fancy artwork. Pictorial plates were made in abundance, illustrated with religious motifs, native Dutch scenes with [[windmills]] and [[fishing]] [[boat]]s, hunting scenes, landscapes and seascapes. The Delft potters also made tiles in vast numbers (estimated at eight hundred million over a period of two hundred years&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;); many Dutch houses still have tiles that were fixed in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Delftware became popular, was widely exported in Europe and reached China and Japan. Chinese and Japanese potters made porcelain versions of Delftware for export to Europe.

By the late 18th century, Delftware potters had lost their market to British porcelain and the new white earthenware.

There are good collections of old Delftware in the [[Rijksmuseum]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

==English delftware==

{{main|English Delftware}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ajvdelft.jpg|thumb|English delftware drug jar circa 1720-40 (copyright ajv private collection)|{{puic|1=Ajvdelft.jpg|log=2009 February 28}}]] --&gt;English delftware was made in the British Isles between about 1550 and the late 18th century.  The main centers of production were [[London]], [[Bristol]] and [[Liverpool]] with smaller centers at [[Wincanton]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Dublin]].

[[John Stow]]'s ''Survey of London'' (1598) records the arrival in 1567 of two Antwerp potters, Jasper Andries and Jacob Jansen, in [[Norwich]], where they made "Gally Paving Tiles, and vessels for Apothecaries and others, very artificially".&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt; In 1579 Jansen applied to [[Queen Elizabeth I]] for the sole right to practice "galleypotting" in London and soon set up a workshop at [[Aldgate]] to the east of the city.  There were already other Flemish potters in London, two of them in [[Southwark]] recorded in 1571 as "painters of pottes".&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

English delftware pottery and its painted decoration is similar in many respects to that from Holland, but its peculiarly English quality has been commented upon: "...&amp;nbsp;there is a relaxed tone and a sprightliness which is preserved throughout the history of English delftware; the overriding mood is provincial and naive rather than urbane and sophisticated."&lt;ref&gt;Carnegy, p.51. Caiger-Smith describes its mood as "ingenuous, direct, sometimes eccentric", and Garner talks of its "quite distinctive character".&lt;/ref&gt; Its methods and techniques were less sophisticated than those of its continental counterparts.

The earliest known piece with an English inscription is a dish dated 1600 in the London Museum. It is painted in blue, purple, green, orange and yellow and depicts the Tower of London and Old London Bridge, surrounded by the words, "THE ROSE IS RED THE LEAVES ARE GRENE GOD SAVE ELIZABETH OUR QUEENE" and an Italianate border of masks and leaves. The rim is decorated with dashes of blue and can be considered the first in series of large decorated dishes so painted and called blue-dash chargers. Blue-dash chargers, usually between about 25 and 35&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter with abstract, floral, religious, [http://www.antiquedelft.com/cbr5.html patriotic] or [http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_image.aspx?image=ps337952.jpg&amp;retpage=20594 topographical]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} motifs, were produced in quantity by London and Bristol potters until the early 18th century.  As they were kept for decoration on walls, dressers and side-tables, many have survived and they are well represented in museum collections.

Smaller and more everyday wares were also made: paving tiles, mugs, drug jars, dishes, wine bottles, [http://www.antiquedelft.com/keg.html posset pots], salt pots, candlesticks, fuddling cups,&lt;ref&gt;Ale mugs joined in groups of three, four or five with connecting holes to confuse the drinker.&lt;/ref&gt; puzzle jugs,&lt;ref&gt;Similar to fuddling cups,&lt;/ref&gt; barber's bowls, pill slabs, bleeding bowls, [[porringer]]s, and [http://www.antiquedelft.com/mrw.html flower bricks].

Towards the end of the 17th century, changing taste led to the replacement of apothecary pots, paving tiles and large dishes by polite tablewares, delicate ornaments, [[punch (drink)|punch bowls]], teapots, cocoa pots and coffee-pots.

There are good examples of English delftware in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]] and the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].

==Faience==
{{main|Faience}}

In France, the first well-known painter of faïence was [[Masseot Abaquesne]], established in Rouen in the 1530s. Other centres of faience manufacturing developed from the early 18th century, led in 1690 by [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]] in Brittany [https://web.archive.org/web/20050413214248/http://www.faience-de-quimper.com/histquim_en.html], which today possesses a museum devoted to faience, and followed by [[Nevers]], [[Moustiers-Sainte-Marie|Moustiers]] and [[Marseille]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Lunéville]].

The products of faience manufactories are identified by the usual methods of ceramic connoisseurship: the character of the clay body, the character and palette of the [[ceramic glaze|glaze]], and the style of decoration, ''faïence blanche'' being left in its undecorated fired white slip. ''Faïence parlante'' bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. [[Apothecary]] wares, including ''[[albarello|albarelli]]'', can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the ''faïence patriotique'' that was a specialty of the years of the [[French Revolution]].

Popular and folk forms have continued in many countries, including the Mexican [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera]].

In the 20th century there were changes in the formulation of tin-glaze and several artist potters began to work in the medium of tin-glazed pottery.

The cost of tin oxide rose considerably during the 1918-1918 war and resulted in a search for cheaper alternatives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The first successful replacement was [[zirconia]] and later [[zircon]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Ceramics Glaze Technology'', J.R. Taylor &amp; A.C. Bull, The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective opacifiers as tin oxide, their relatively low price has led to a gradual increase in their use, with an associated reduction in the use of tin oxide. The whiteness resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more "clinical" than that from tin oxide and is preferred in some applications.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Science For Craft Potters And Enamellers'', K. Shaw, A.H. &amp; A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, tin oxide still finds use in ceramic manufacture and has been widely used as the opacifier in sanitaryware,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; with up to 6% used in glazes.&lt;ref&gt;''Sanitaryware'', D. Fortuna, Gruppo Editoriale Faenza Editrice s.p.a., Florence, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, tin oxide in glazes, often in conjunction with zircon compounds, is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ceramic Glazes'', F. Singer &amp; W.L. German, Borax Consolidated Limited, London, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

In England at the end of the nineteenth century, [[William de Morgan]] re-discovered the technique of firing luster on tin-glaze "to an extraordinarily high standard".&lt;ref&gt;Carnegy, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of the 20th century there has been a revival of pottery-making in Orvieto and Deruta, the traditional centres of tin-glazed ceramics in Italy, where the shapes and designs of the medieval and renaissance period are reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Cremona, J. and Andreis, T., ''Buongiorno Italia!'', London: BBC Books, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Roger Fry]], [[Vanessa Bell]]  and [[Duncan Grant]] decorated tin-glazed pottery for the [[Omega Workshops]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;  Picasso produced and designed much tin-glazed pottery at [[Vallauris]] in the south of France in the 1940s and 1950s. At the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]], London, [[Dora Billington]] encouraged her students, including [[William R. Newland (potter)|William Newland]] and [[Alan Caiger-Smith]], to use tin-glaze decoration. In Britain during the 1950s Caiger-Smith, Margaret Hine, [[Nicholas Vergette]] and others including the [[Rye Pottery]] made tin-glazed pottery, going against the trend in studio pottery towards [[stoneware]]. Subsequently, Caiger-Smith experimented with the technique of reduced lustre on tin glaze, which had been practiced in Italy until 1700 and Spain until 1800 and had then been forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Lustre Pottery: Technique, Tradition and Innovation in Islam and the Western World''(Faber and Faber, 1985) {{ISBN|0-571-13507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caiger-Smith trained several potters at his Aldermaston Pottery and published ''Tin-glaze Pottery'' which gives a history of maiolica, delftware and faience in Europe and the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;'Tin-Glaze Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware.' A. Caiger-Smith.

{{Translation sidebar}}
The '''translation of "law" to other European languages''' faces several difficulties. In most [[Europe]]an [[language]]s, as well as some others influenced by European languages, there are two different words that can be translated to [[English language|English]] as "[[law]]". For the general comparison in this article the [[Latin]] terms "ius" and "lex" will be used. Etymologically, ''[[ius]]'' has some relation to ''[[right]]'', ''[[justice|just]]'' or ''straight''.

==General==
There are in English two more or less synonymous [[adjective]]s, both from Latin origin, that correspond [[etymology|etymologically]] to the Continental distinction: the common word ''legal'' and the less common ''juridical'' (or even ''juristic''). However, the words ''ius'' and ''lex'' are not synonyms.

''Lex'' can sometimes be translated as ''[[legislation]]'', ''[[statute]]'', ''[[statutory law]]'' or even ''[[Act of Parliament|act]]'', even if the corresponding ''legislatio'', ''statutus'' and ''actus'' also exist. ''Lex'' is law made by a [[politics|political]] [[authority]], such as the [[Parliament]] or the [[Government]]. In modern societies, ''leges'' are usually written, though this is not a necessary feature. ''Lex'' is often used in the [[plural]] (''leges''), since each act is one ''lex''.

On the other hand, ''[[ius]]'' is also [[polysemy|polysemous]], since it can mean either ''law'' or ''right''. Continental legal scholars sometimes make a distinction between "subjective ''ius''" (any legal right) and "objective ''ius''" (the whole law), but this does not happen in ordinary language. The two senses of ''ius'' can be easily distinguished in most cases.

When ''ius'' means ''law'', it usually has some [[semantics|semantic]] connection to ''what is right'', ''[[justice|just]]'' or ''straight''. For instance, the [[Germany|German]] [[List of state mottos|motto]] ''Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit'' (literally ''Unity and law and freedom'')) has been translated as ''Unity and justice and freedom'', even though there is a different word for ''justice'' (''Gerechtigkeit''). ''Lex'' does not have such a connection. Some translators of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] works have translated ''Recht'' as ''objective right'' (see Steiner, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;276), although those works, especially Kant's, are just about law or, at most, about the best law.

Present day continental [[legal education|law schools]] and [[Faculty (university)|faculties]] claim to study ''ius''. [[Middle Ages|Mediaeval]] universities, on the contrary, usually had a faculty of ''leges''. [[English Wikipedia]]'s article on "[[law]]" [[Interwiki links|link]]s to other languages Wikipedias' articles on the equivalent to ''ius''.

There are a few European languages other than English where "law" translates into one word, such as [[Polish language|Polish]] ''prawo''. On the other side, a prominent non-European language which makes the distinction is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], where قانون (''qānūn'') is equivalent to ''lex'' and ﺣـق (''ḥaqq'') is equivalent to ''ius''.

To clarify the difference one may look at how these phrases translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:

{| class="wikitable"
| width="250"| civil law = ''derecho civil'' || width="250"| forbidden by law = ''prohibido por la ley''
|-
| common law = ''derecho común'' || act of Congress = ''ley del Congreso''
|-
| immigration law = ''derecho de inmigración'' || Immigration Act = ''ley de inmigración''
|-
| natural law = ''derecho natural'' || laws of nature = ''leyes de la naturaleza''
|}

In bilingual and multilingual jurisdictions, a careful translation is needed in legal contexts to avoid ambiguity.  Even excellent translation cannot capture all the connotations of the original words, however, and many scholars argue for bilingual judges who can parse both versions of the text.

In Canada since 1891 the "[[equal authenticity rule]]" has held that the French and English versions of all federal laws are considered equally authoritative.  Nevertheless, the English and French texts of important may not translate exactly, which leaves open the possibility that justices may understand the same law to mean two different things.  This includes the problem of "law" versus "''droit''". For example, [[Osgoode Hall]] scholar Robert Leckey argues that in the 2006 [[Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys|Multani case]] over the banning of [[kirpans]] (Sikh ceremonial daggers) by a school board in Quebec, the justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], despite all writing their reasons in French, disagreed over the meaning of the phrase "''ne peuvent être restreints que par une règle de droit''" in Section 1 of the ''[[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', which appears in the English version of the text as "not prescribed by law".  Relying on different cultural and academic backgrounds (Quebec's civil law and francophone administrative culture, versus the English common law and British traditions elsewhere in Canada) they either decided that the action of school board in banning the kirpan was, or was not, "''une règle de droit''" or "law" (without reference to the word "prescribed").  Lackey asserts that "[i]n administrative law from France, and in administrative law scholarship written in French in Quebec, a regulation is 'une règle de droit' and a decision is not 'une règle de droit'" whereas in English-language scholarship the difference between "prescribed by law" and not "prescribed by law" has nothing to do with a distinction between general norms and individual decisions.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/ohlj/vol45/iss3/4 Leckey, Robert. "Prescribed by Law/Une Règle de Droit." Osgoode Hall Law Journal 45.3 (2007) : 571-620]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1235&amp;context=ohlj&lt;/ref&gt;

This difference between English and other European languages is sometimes invoked in the debates between [[legal positivism]], [[natural law]] and [[Interpretivism (legal)|interpretivism]]. Berkowitz (2005) argues that the rise of legal positivism corresponds to a "transformation of the sense of 'law', a difficult topic made more so by a particular limitation of the English language", the non-distinction between ''ius'' and ''lex''. [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] himself, in ''The concept of law'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;206 ff.), argued that the distinction between ''ius'' and ''lex'' might clarify the relation between law and [[morality]]. A similar point is made by Gardner (2004) in order to distinguish between "law" in general and "legal law".

For the sake of examples, this article uses the Latin words.

==The discussion on the relation between ''ius'' (''jus'') and ''lex''==

Continental [[legal positivism|legal positivists]] of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century claimed that all ''ius'' is ''lex''.

In German "Law Schools" sometimes the following allegory is told: The word "Recht" is closely related to the word "Rache" (which is "revenge" in English language). It brings in the idea of "an eye for an eye" as first instrument to overcome uncontrolled revenge. From this point of view, Recht is institutionalized Rache. But this means: If someone says: "I had 'the right' to do this.", he should say: "I did it out of revenge.", as the person is not a "legal" institution...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3700">[[Image:USICOMOS Exchange.png|right]]The '''US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program''' is an exchange program for young professions in [[historic preservation]] through the United States National Committee of the [[ICOMOS|International Council on Monuments and Sites]]. The aim of the program is to promote an understanding of [[international preservation]] policies, methods and techniques that lead to a continuing dialogue between countries. As of 2007, nearly 600 young preservation professionals and over 70 countries have participated in this program since its creation in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org/usicomos/International_Exchange_Program/USICOMOS_International_Exchange_Program.htm US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Overview ==
The program began with a one-time exchange between [[US/ICOMOS]] and [[ICOMOS United Kingdom]]. It since has expanded to involve between 20 and 30 young preservation professionals each year. US/ICOMOS internships are geared toward individuals who are in their last year of a relevant graduate program or have been working for 1–3 years in a professional capacity. The program is very competitive in that only 1 in 5 applicants are awarded internships in any given year.

Interns are selected on a competitive basis for participation in the US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program. Internships are approximately 12 weeks in length and are usually held during the summer (from June to August), although some internships may be held at other times of the year. US/ICOMOS hosts all U.S. and international interns for a program orientation in Washington, DC. Interns then disperse to their various host organizations where they complete a preservation-related project designed by the host organization. At the end of the summer, all interns reconvene in Washington, DC for a final farewell program.

The program is made possible through generous grants from many U.S. foundations, government agencies and individual contributors, and ICOMOS National Committees of participating countries.

== Intern Qualifications ==
Interns must be graduate students or young professionals with at minimum an undergraduate degree in a preservation-related field. Candidates are asked to submit a curriculum vitae, two letters of recommendation, a 500-word essay describing their reasons for wanting to participate in the program, and examples of their work. Participants are selected on the basis of skill, demonstrated commitment to historic preservation, previous experience and academic concentration in the field and the ability to represent their country in an exchange program. In addition, interns are chosen whose skills, training, interest and previous experience match the needs of host organizations. Applications submitted by U.S. citizens are selected for specific internships by a jury of professional members of US/ICOMOS; applications from other ICOMOS national committees are screened at the national committee level, and then forwarded to US/ICOMOS for selection and assignments. The file of the strongest candidate(s) for a particular internship is sent to the host office (in the U.S. and in participating countries) for review and final approval.
