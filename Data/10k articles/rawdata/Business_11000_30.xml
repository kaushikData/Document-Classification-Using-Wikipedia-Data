'''130 Cedar Street''', formerly known as the '''Green Exchange Building''' is a mid-rise building in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It is located between Cedar Street and [[Albany Street (Manhattan)|Albany Street]] running along [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]], sharing a block with [[90 West Street]]. It was built in 1931 and was designed by [[James Renwick Jr.|Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Guard]].&lt;ref name=911guide&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/911guide/130cedar|title=130 Cedar Street|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was completed in 1931.

==September 11 attacks==
When the South Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] collapsed on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], 130 Cedar Street was completely ravaged. Hundreds of tons of fiery debris rained down onto the building. The top of the buildings northeast corner completely collapsed under the debris. A column section from WTC 2 penetrated the 10th floor roof slab. The projectile impacts also lit fires, which occurred primarily above the 9th floor. Fire damage was evident on the 11th and 12th floors in the northwest corner. The Amish Market located on the ground floor was completely destroyed and burned, later relocating further uptown. Several concrete columns were cracked, possibly from the impact. Several bays at the northeast corner were severely damaged from debris impact.&lt;ref name=911guide /&gt; After the attacks, the building was uninhabitable and lost all of its tenants.

== Renovation ==
Like many buildings in the area, 130 Cedar Street had to be thoroughly decontaminated after the damage it sustained. In 2004, it was announced that the office building would be transformed into a hotel, despite rumors that the building would be demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wirednewyork.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5527|title=World Center Hotel|last=|first=|date=December 23, 2004|website=wirednewyork.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

After many years of revitalization, the building was finally reopened as a [[Club Quarters]] hotel. During the restoration process, seven new floors were added, making the building 19 stories tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/176364/club-quarters-world-trade-center-new-york-city-ny-usa|title=Club Quarters World Trade Center|last=|first=|date=|website=emporis.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtownny.com/sites/default/files/research/Hotel%20Inventory%20Q4%202014.pdf "Hotel Inventory Q4 2014"] Alliance for Downtown New York&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the head of [[Televisión Litoral S.A.]], the largest media conglomerate in Argentina outside [[Buenos Aires]], which includes the local TV channel [[Canal 3 (Rosario)|Canal 3]], and the radio stations LT2 (Radio Dos), FM Vida, and Radio Cataratas. Gollán started Televisión Litoral S.A. in 1965.

Gollán was the [[mayor]] of Rosario for four months, between 18 May and 23 September 1971, during the military dictatorship presided by [[Alejandro Agustín Lanusse]]. 

After the coup d'état of 1976 that deposed [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]] and started the [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional]], he continued to support the military government. In a reception held on 28 December 1976 in the Officers' [[Mess]], Gollán spoke to Commander of the 2nd Army Corps [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] in the name of the press: "We are proud to be able to stand by you and the force you represent in the task you are undertaking. We the journalists will always support this labor."

Through Televisión Litoral, Gollán started in 1977 the Ibero-American Advertising Festival (''[[Festival Iberoamericano de Publicidad]]'', or FIAP), which has continued to be celebrated annually, with the participation of producers from Spain, Portugal and several Latin American countries.

On 15 March 2005 Gollán was awarded an honorary membership of the [[Order of the British Empire]], which was delivered by [[United Kingdom|British]] Ambassador John Hughes, "for his service, because he is a friend of the British Embassy and visitors". Gollán is the First Vice-Deacon of the [[Consular corps|Consular Corps]] of Rosario and the Honorary Consul of the [[United Kingdom]].

'''Asset protection''' (sometimes also referred to as ''debtor-creditor law'') is a set of legal techniques and a body of statutory and [[common law]] dealing with protecting [[asset]]s of individuals and business entities from civil money judgments. The goal of asset protection planning is to insulate assets from claims of creditors without [[perjury]] or [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Controversial Truth About Asset Protection Planning | author= Bill Williams | publisher = Asset Protection Planners| date = | url = https://www.assetprotectionplanners.com/articles/the-controversial-truth-about-asset-protection-planning/ | accessdate = October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asset protection consists of methods available to protect assets from [[liability (accounting)|liabilities]] arising elsewhere. It should not be confused with ''limiting liability'', which concerns the ability to stop or constrain liability to the asset or activity from which it arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Real Estate Investor's Guide to Corporations, LLCs &amp; Asset Protection Entities |last= [[Richard T. Williamson]]|first=  |year=2008 |publisher= Kaplan Publishing|location= |isbn=978-1-4277-9702-5 |page= 43|url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assets that are shielded from creditors by law are few (common examples include some home equity, certain retirement plans and interests in LLCs and limited partnerships [and even these are not always unreachable]). Assets that are almost always unreachable are those to which one does not hold legal title. In many cases it is possible to vest legal title to personal assets in a trust, an agent or a nominee, while retaining all the control of the assets. The goal of asset protection is similar to [[bankruptcy]], and the two practice areas go hand-in-hand. When a debtor has none to few assets, the bankruptcy route is preferable. When the debtor has significant assets, asset protection may be the solution.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The four threshold factors that are either expressly or implicitly analyzed in each asset protection case are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Jacob|title=A Lawyer's Guide to Asset Protection Planning in California|date=2017|publisher=Aliant Law|isbn=9780983978060|page=8|edition=Second|url=https://www.aliantlaw.com|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The identity of the person engaging in asset protection planning

:- If the debtor is an individual, does he or she have a spouse, and is the spouse also liable? If the spouse is not liable, is it possible to enter into a transmutation agreement? Are the spouses engaged in activities that are equally likely to result in lawsuits or is one spouse more likely to be sued than the other?
:- If the debtor is an entity, did an individual guarantee the entity's debt? How likely is it that the creditor will be able to pierce the corporate veil or otherwise get the assets of the individual owners? Is there a statute that renders the individual personally liable for the obligations of the entity?

* The nature of the claim

:- Are there specific claims or the asset protection is taken as a result of a desire to insulate from lawsuits?
:- If the claim has been reduced to a judgement, what assets does the judgement encumber?
:- Is the claim [[Bankruptcy discharge|dischargeable]]?
:- What is the statute of limitations for bringing the claim?

* The identity of the creditor

:- How aggressive is the creditor?
:- Is the creditor a government agency? Taxing authority? Some government agencies possess powers of seizure that other government agencies do not.

* The nature of the assets

:- To what extent are the assets exempt from the claims of the creditors? For example, the degree of protection offered by the [[homestead exemption]], the exemption of the assets in a qualified plan, i.e. assets in a plan under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) etc.

Whilst the aforementioned use of Trusts will be of benefit in a number of cases the question of ownership can still arise, as although legal ownership may have been transferred to the trustees, beneficial ownership may still in many cases lie with the settler of the Trust. A Private Placement Life Insurance contract (PPLI), can provide a greater degree of protection and privacy than most Trusts, and can also be integrated with an existing trust if necessary. Whilst Trusts may not be recognised in many Jurisdictions, Life insurance also has the advantage of being Multi jurisdictional.

==United States legislation==
United States federal bankruptcy laws and ERISA laws exempt certain assets from creditors, including certain retirement plans.  All fifty states also have laws that exempt certain assets from creditors.  These vary from state to state, but they often include exemptions for a certain amount of [[Home equity|equity]] in a personal residence, individual [[pension|retirement accounts]], clothing, or other personal property.

All fifty U.S. states also have laws that protect the owners of a [[corporation]], [[limited partnership]], or [[limited liability company]] from the liabilities of the entity.  Many states limit the remedies of a creditor of a limited partner or a member in an LLC, thereby providing some protection for the assets of the entity from the creditors of a member.

All fifty U.S. states provide some protection for the assets of a [[trust (law)|trust]] against the creditors of the [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiaries]].  Some states allow asset protection for a self-settled trust (a trust in which the settlor or creator of the trust is included as a potential discretionary beneficiary) and some states do not.

Creditors have several tools to overcome the laws that provide asset protection.  First, there are federal and state [[fraudulent conveyance|fraudulent transfer]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 548&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are two bodies of fraudulent transfer law: the [[Title 11 of the United States Code|Bankruptcy Code]] and state fraudulent transfer statutes. Most states have adopted [[List of Uniform Acts (United States)|Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act]] which defines what constitutes a fraudulent transfer. The UFTA and the Bankruptcy Code both provide that a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer with the "actual intention to hinder, delay or defraud" any creditor of the debtor.   While UFTA applies clearly to present creditors, the distinction between a future creditor and a future potential creditor is not as clear. The UFTA is commonly held to apply only to future creditors and not to future potential creditors (those whose claim arises after the transfer, but there was no foreseeable connection between the creditor and the debtor at the time of the transfer).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

There are also laws which allow a creditor to [[piercing the corporate veil|pierce the corporate veil]] of an entity and go after the owners for the debts of the entity.  It may also be possible for a creditor of a member to reach the assets of an entity through a constructive trust claim, or a claim for a reverse piercing of a corporate veil.

The anti-alienation provision of the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA) exempts from claims of creditors the assets of pension, profit-sharing, or [[401(k)]] plans. Two exceptions are carved out for [[qualified domestic relations order]]s and claims under the [[Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990]]. Because the protection is set forth in a federal statute, it will trump any state fraudulent transfer law. Protection of ERISA is afforded to employees only and does not cover employers. The owner of a business is treated as an employer, even though he may also be the employee of the same business, as in a [[closely held corporation]]. Accordingly, ERISA protection does not apply to sole proprietors, to one owner business, whether incorporated or unincorporated, and to partnerships, unless the plan covers employees other than the owners, partners and their spouses.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Asset protection planning requires a working knowledge of federal and state exemption laws, federal and state bankruptcy laws, federal and state tax laws, the comparative laws of many jurisdictions (onshore and offshore), choice of law principles, in addition to the laws of trusts, estates, corporations and business entities.  The process of asset protection planning involves assessing the facts, circumstances, and objectives of an individual, evaluating the pros and cons of the various options, designing a structure that is most likely to accomplish all the objectives of the individual (including asset protection objectives), preparing legal documents to carry out the plan, and ensuring that the various legal entities are operated properly in accordance with the laws and the objectives of the individual.  This process involves providing legal advice and legal work and most states prohibit the practice of law without a license.

==History==

Asset protection planning began to develop as a stand-alone area of the law in the late 1970s. It began coming into prominence in the late 1980s, with the advent and the marketing of offshore asset protection trusts. Colorado attorney [[Barry Engel]] is credited with the introduction of that concept and the development of asset protection trust law statutes in the Cook Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Low-Tax.net Cook Islands Table of Statutes, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The most distinctive feature of the [[offshore trust]] is the fact that the settlor or creator of the trust may be included among the potential beneficiaries of the trust without causing the assets of the trust to be subject to the creditors of the settlor.  This is often referred to as a "self-settled trust."

Over the years, this new field of law enjoyed a marginal reputation, but started going mainstream in the mid-1990s. A 2003 article in the [[Wall Street Journal]] claimed that 60% of America's millionaires have considered engaging in asset protection planning.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, Oct. 14, 2003, Rachel Emma Silverman, "Litigation Boom Spurs Efforts to Shield Assets"&lt;/ref&gt;

Choice of law rules in the United States make it possible for a person from any state to create a trust, corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company that is governed by the laws of any other state or jurisdiction.  Because of this ability to "forum shop," various states and other jurisdictions have modified their laws to allow greater asset protection in order to make them competitive with other jurisdictions.

In most states, the assets of a self-settled trust are not protected from the creditors of the settlor.  In 1997, the [[State of Alaska]] passed a statute which provided that the assets of an Alaska self-settled trust are not subject to the creditors of the settlor.&lt;ref&gt;Alaska Statutes Section 34.40.110&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, the following states have adopted legislation allowing for a self-settled asset protection trust: [[Nevada]], [[Delaware]], [[South Dakota]], [[Wyoming]], [[Tennessee]], [[Utah]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Colorado]], [[Missouri]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[New Hampshire]]. This legislation created a favorable offshore asset protection trust jurisdiction also for non-US settlors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The United States As An Offshore Asset Protection Trust Jurisdiction – The World’s Best Kept Secret |author=Alexander A. Bove, Jr. |publisher=Trusts &amp; Trustees, Vol. 14 Issue 1 (Oxford Journals, 2008) |date= |url=http://www.bovelanga.com/publications/articles/US%20as%20Offshore%20Asset%20Protection%20Jurisdiction.pdf |accessdate=September 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708085701/http://www.bovelanga.com/publications/articles/US%20as%20Offshore%20Asset%20Protection%20Jurisdiction.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable debate about the comparative effectiveness of the asset protection provided by the laws of each jurisdiction, onshore and offshore. Similarly, the asset protection features provided by corporations, limited partnerships and limited liability companies vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Once again, Alaska's limited liability company statute provides innovative advantages over other states.  Case law from [[North Carolina]] demonstrates the asset protection advantages of a transfer to a limited liability company (see Herring v. Keasler, 150 NC App 598 (01-1000) 06/04/2002).

Just as the [[Cook Islands]] have developed a reputation for the best offshore jurisdiction for an asset protection trust, [[Nevis]] stands out in the competition for the best jurisdiction to file a limited liability company. The Nevis limited liability company statute is based on the Delaware limited liability statute, but they have a few added advantages. One advantage of a Nevis LLC is that the members and managers are not disclosed to the public.

There is some debate over the ethics of asset protection planning. On one hand, every attorney that creates a trust, corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company is engaging in some form of asset protection planning. On the other hand, most would agree that it is ethically inappropriate to assist a person to commit fraud or evade income taxes. The timing and the purposes of the plan seem to be the determinative factors as to whether a plan will be considered ethically and legally appropriate.  In some cases, individuals have gone to jail for contempt of court for failing to unwind a plan that a judge felt was repugnant to the principles of law and justice, however in those cases the individuals incarcerated retained some control over their plan immediately prior to, or during, litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Importance of Property APT Design &amp; Counsel | author= Howard Rosen &amp; Patricia Donlevy-Rosen| publisher = The Asset Protection News| date = | url = http://protectyou.com/1998/10/the-importance-of-a-property-asset-protection-design/ | accessdate = February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Auditor General of Sri Lanka''' ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]]: ශ්‍රී ලංකා විගණකාධිපති ''Śrī Laṃkā viganakādhipathi''; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: இலங்கை கணக்காய்வாளர் தலைமை) is appointed by the [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] to aid [[accountability]] by conducting independent [[financial audit|audit]]s of government operations. These audits provide members of [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|Parliament]] with objective information to help them examine the government's activities and hold it to account. According to the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|constitution]], the Auditor General is empowered to audit the accounts of all departments of Government, the Offices of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Judicial Service Commission, the Public Service Commission, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the Secretary-General of Parliament and the Commissioner of Elections, local authorities, public corporations and business or other undertakings vested in the Government under any written law.{{citaiton needed|date=November 2017}}

The Auditor General of Sri Lanka is the head of the [[Auditor General's Department (Sri Lanka)|Auditor General's Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Auditor General’s Role and Responsibilities|url=http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=54&amp;lang=en|publisher=auditorgeneral.gov.lk|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Auditor Generals|url=http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=88&amp;Itemid=56&amp;lang=en|publisher=auditorgeneral.gov.lk|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history_doc"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Auditor General's Department|url=http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/images/aboutus/HistoryoftheAuditorGeneralsDepartment.pdf|website=auditorgeneral.gov.lk|publisher=Auditor General's Department|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Auditors General==
While the title of ''Auditor General of Sri Lanka'' was formally adopted on the country's enactment of its [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|1978 republican constitution]], the position or an equivalent to it has existed since 1799 under various titles.&lt;ref name="history_doc"/&gt; The Department in its current form considers itself a continuation of the office established in 1799, and the table below thus lists all officeholders that have held positions equivalent to the position of the current Auditor General.&lt;ref name="history_doc"/&gt;

'''Bernice Herstein''' (September 6, 1918 &amp;ndash; November 8, 1950) was an American socialite, the wife of investor [[Seymour Durst]] and mother of their four children [[Robert Durst|Robert]], [[Douglas Durst|Douglas]], Wendy and Thomas Durst.&lt;ref name="findagrave1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/95234057 |title=Bernice Herstein Durst (1918 - 1950) - Find A Grave Memorial |website=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
Herstein was born into a Jewish family from Germany in [[Scarsdale]], [[Westchester County]], New York. She married Seymour Durst in 1940. She died under mysterious circumstances, falling from the roof of the family's Scarsdale home during the middle of the night, with her oldest child Robert (a suspected murderer) claiming to have been forced to witness the entire event while Douglas insists all four children were together at a neighbors house when she perished. Douglas Durst maintains his brother is attempting to blame their father and childhood events for his criminal behavior to garner public sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2015/03/robert-durst-murders-wife-susie-berman|title=The Fugitive Heir|last=Zemen|first=Ned|date=March 16, 2015|website=www.vanityfair.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roberta Brooke Astor''' (née '''Russell'''; March 30, 1902 – August 13, 2007) was an American philanthropist, socialite, and writer who was the chairwoman of the Vincent Astor Foundation, which had been established by her third husband, [[Vincent Astor]], son of [[John Jacob Astor IV]] and great-great grandson of America's first multi-millionaire, [[John Jacob Astor]]. Brooke Astor was the author of two novels and two volumes of personal memoirs.

==Early life==
Brooke was born in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], the only child of [[John H. Russell, Jr.|John Henry Russell, Jr.]] (1872–1947), the 16th [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the [[US Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], and his wife, Mabel Cecile Hornby Howard (1879–1967). Her paternal grandfather [[John Henry Russell|John Henry Russell, Sr.]] was a [[rear admiral]] in the U.S. Navy. She was named for her maternal grandmother (Roberta) and was known as Bobby to close friends and family.

Due to her father's career, she spent much of her childhood living in China, the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], and other places. Also, she briefly attended [[The Madeira School]] in 1919 but graduated from the [[Holton-Arms School]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Marriages==

===John Dryden Kuser===
She married her first husband, [[John Dryden Kuser]] (1897–1964), shortly after her 17th birthday, on April 26, 1919, in Washington, D.C. "I certainly wouldn't advise getting married that young to anyone," she said later in life. "At the age of sixteen, you're not jelled yet. The first thing you look at, you fall in love with."&lt;ref name="klemesrud"&gt;{{cite news |first=Judy  |last=Klemesrud |authorlink=Judy Klemesrud |title=Brooke Astor: The Private Moments of a Public Benefactor; Married at 16 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/06/15/archives/brooke-astor-the-private-moments-of-a-public-benefactor-married-at.html |work=The New York Times |date=June 15, 1980| accessdate=2014-11-06| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John was the son of the financier and conservationist [[Anthony R. Kuser|Anthony Rudolph Kuser]] and Susie Fairfield Drydan. Susie's father was [[U.S. Senator]] [[John F. Dryden|John Fairfield Dryden]]. John Kuser later became a [[New Jersey]] Republican councilman, assemblyman, and state senator.&lt;ref&gt;In 1927, Brooke and John Kuser lived in a New York City [[terraced house|townhouse]] which they rented from [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine Talmadge Force]], the stepmother of Brooke's eventual third husband.&lt;/ref&gt; They also lived in [[Bernardsville, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| authorlink=Judith Miller (journalist)| last=Miller| first=Judith| title=Old Money, New Needs| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/17/magazine/old-money-new-needs.html?pagewanted=3| work=The New York Times| date=November 17, 1991| accessdate=2011-03-21| quote="Eventually Kuser fell in love with another woman and left his wife.

Brooke described her tumultuous first marriage as the "Worst years of my life", which was punctuated by her husband's alleged [[spousal abuse|physical abuse]], alcoholism, and [[adultery]].&lt;ref name="klemesrud"/&gt;  According to Frances Kiernan's 2007 biography of Brooke Astor, when Brooke was six months pregnant with the couple's only child, her husband broke her jaw during a marital fight.&lt;ref name=astorplace/&gt; "I learned about terrible manners from the family of my first husband," she told ''[[The New York Times]]''. "They didn't know how to treat people."&lt;ref name="klemesrud"/&gt; A year after the marriage, according to a published account of the divorce proceedings, John "began to embarrass her in social activities" and "told her that he no longer loved her and that their marriage was a failure."&lt;ref name=custody&gt;{{cite news |title=Mrs. Kuser Files Suit; Gets Custody of Son.

Brooke and John had one son, [[Anthony Dryden Marshall|Anthony Dryden "Tony" Kuser]], May 30, 1924. She filed for divorce February 15, 1930, in [[Reno, Nevada]]. It was finalized later that year.&lt;ref name=custody/&gt;  John married his second wife, Vieva Marie Fisher Banks (formerly Mrs. James Lenox Banks, Jr.) September 6, 1930, in [[Virginia City, Nevada]]. They had one daughter, Suzanne Dryden Kuser, and divorced in October 1935. A week later, Sen. Kuser married Louise Mattei Farry (formerly Mrs. Joseph Farry). In 1958, he married, as his fourth wife, Grace Egglesfield Gibbons (widow of John J. Gibbons). An amateur ornithologist and president of the New Jersey [[Audubon Society]], Sen. Kuser introduced the bill that made the [[American goldfinch|eastern goldfinch]] the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]] of [[New Jersey]]. He also was, at various times, an insurance and real estate broker in New Jersey (1937–1942) and Nevada (1942–1955), a vice president of [[Lenox, Inc.]], the pottery and china company, a columnist for the [[Nevada State Journal]] (1943–1947), and a director of the [[20th-Century Fox|Fox Film Corporation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Charles Henry Marshall===
Her second husband, whom she married in 1932, was Charles Henry "Buddy" Marshall (1891–1952). Buddy was the senior partner of the investment firm Butler, Herrick &amp; Marshall, a brother-in-law of the mercantile heir [[Marshall Field III]], and a descendant of [[James Lenox]], the founder of the [[Lenox Library (Massachusetts)|Lenox Library]].

Astor later wrote that the marriage was "a great love match."&lt;ref name="klemesrud" /&gt;

She had two stepchildren by the marriage, Peter Marshall and Helen Huntington Marshall.  Helen Marshall's first marriage was to composer [[Ernest Schelling]]&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{cite news| first=Christopher| last=Gray| title=Streetscapes: 863 Park Avenue; One of the Oldest Luxury Apartment Houses on Park| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/12/realestate/streetscapes-863-park-avenue-one-of-the-oldest-luxury-apartment-houses-on-park.html?exprod=permalink&amp;partner=permalink| work=The New York Times| date=July 12, 1998| accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, her second to cellist [[János Scholz]]&lt;ref name=Pace&gt;{{cite news| first=Eric| last=Pace| title=Janos Scholz, 89, Cellist, Scholar And Morgan Library Benefactor| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/obituaries/janos-scholz-89-cellist-scholar-and-morgan-library-benefactor.html| work=The New York Times| date=June 6, 1993| accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Brooke's then-18-year-old son Tony changed his name to [[Anthony Dryden Marshall]] out of admiration for his stepfather. Buddy's financial fortunes turned in the mid-1940s, at which time Brooke went to work for eight years as a features editor at ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]]'' magazine. She also briefly worked for [[Ruby Ross Wood]], a prominent New York interior decorator who, with her associate [[Billy Baldwin (decorator)|Billy Baldwin]], decorated the Marshalls' apartment at 1 Gracie Square in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Astor's association with ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]]'' has been established by a contemporary issue of the magazine, which shows "Mrs. Charles H. Marshall of Ruby Ross Wood, Inc." in the design firm's office. The gossip columnist [[Cindy Adams]] stated July 28, 2006, that Astor was fired from her position at ''House &amp; Garden'' and also worked briefly as a secretary to the American decorator [[Dorothy Draper]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Vincent Astor===
In October 1953, 11 months after Charles Marshall's death, she married her third and final husband, [[Vincent Astor|William Vincent Astor]] (1891–1959), the chairman of the board of ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine and the last notably rich American member of the famous [[Astor family]]. Vincent was the son of ''[[RMS Titanic]]'' victim [[John Jacob Astor IV|John Jacob "Jack" Astor IV]] (1864–1912) and socialite [[Ava Lowle Willing]] (1868–1958), he had been married and divorced twice before, was childless,  and was known to have a difficult personality.

"He had a dreadful childhood, and as a result, had moments of deep melancholy," Brooke recalled. "But I think I made him happy. That's what I set out to do. I'd literally dance with the dogs, sing and play the piano, and I would make him laugh, something no one had ever done before. Because of his money, Vincent was very suspicious of people. That's what I tried to cure him of."&lt;ref name="klemesrud"/&gt;

Not wanting to die alone, Astor agreed to divorce his second wife, [[Mary Benedict Cushing|Mary Benedict "Minnie" Cushing]], only after she had found him a replacement spouse. Minnie had first suggested Janet Newbold Rhinelander-Stewart, the newly divorced wife of James Smith Bush II, who turned down Astor's proposal with startling candor stating "I don't even like you". Minnie then suggested the recently widowed Brooke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/social-history/2009/part-iii-vincent-the-astor-who-gave-away-the-money| title=Part III: Vincent, the Astor Who Gave Away the Money| date=30 April 2009| work=[[New York Social Diary]]| accessdate=2014-11-07| quote=Janet Newbold married (1) Allan A.

Bush|George Herbert Walker Bush]], and a great-uncle of U.S. president [[George W. Bush|George Walker Bush]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few people believed that the Astor-Marshall union was anything more than a financial transaction. According to Brooke's friend [[Louis Auchincloss]]; "Of course she married Vincent for the money," adding, "I wouldn't respect her if she hadn't. Only a twisted person would have married him for love."&lt;ref name=astorplace&gt;{{cite news |first=Liesl |last=Schillinger |title=Astor's Place |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/books/review/Schillinger-t.html?ex=1187841600&amp;en=a6b58d082dcac64f&amp;ei=5070 |work=The New York Times |date=June 17, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her brief marriage to Vincent, whom she called "Captain", Brooke participated in his real-estate and hotel empire and his philanthropic endeavors. Between 1954 and 1958, she redecorated one of his properties, the Hotel St. Regis, which had been built by his father. Vincent died leaving all his money to Brooke. His younger half-brother socialite [[John Jacob Astor VI|John Jacob "Jakey" Astor VI]] (1912–1992) was left with nothing since Vincent's hatred for Jakey's mother Madeleine (Jack's second wife and widow) led him to believe he was not even a biological Astor. Vincent had nothing but contempt for him.&lt;ref name=Vincent&gt;{{cite web| title=Part II: Vincent, the Astor Who Gave Away the Money| url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/node/317873/print| work=New York Social Diary| date=29 April 2009| accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jakey felt cheated and resentfully stated Vincent "had the legal, not the moral right to keep all the money".&lt;ref name=Survivors&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilson| first=Andrew| title=Shadow of the Titanic: The Extraordinary Stories of Those Who Survived| url=https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Titanic-Extraordinary-Stories-Survived/dp/1451671571#reader_1451671571| date=6 March 2012| publisher=Atria Books| isbn=978-1451671568| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was certain that Vincent was "mentally incompetent" when signing his last will in June 1958 due to alcoholism, though Brooke insisted otherwise. While Vincent was hospitalized, Brooke would often bring him liquor. Jakey accused her of using the liquor to influence the will in her favor. Jakey ended up settling for $250,000. The rest of money remained with the Vincent Astor foundation and Brooke. Before Vincent's death, Brooke once privately admitted to her daughter-in-law Elizabeth Cynthia "Liz" Cryan: "I don't think I can stand being married to him anymore. I don't think I can take it. He never wants to go anywhere — he's so antisocial."&lt;ref name=BrookeMemoir&gt;{{cite book| last=Gordon| first=Meryl| title=Mrs. Astor Regrets: The Hidden Betrayals of a Family Beyond Reproach| date=22 October 2009| publisher=Mariner Books| isbn=978-0547247984| url=https://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Astor-Regrets-Betrayals-Reproach/dp/B003TO6GFW/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1GZW564G8QZH7AVMXVFX#reader_B003TO6GFW| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though she received several proposals after Astor's death, she chose not to remarry. In a 1980 interview, she stated: "I'd have to marry a man of a suitable age and somebody who was a somebody, and that's not easy. Frankly, I think I'm unmarriageable now", and also said "I'm too used to having things my way. But I still enjoy a flirt now and then."&lt;ref name="klemesrud"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Though she was appointed a member of the board of the Astor Foundation soon after her marriage, upon Vincent Astor's death in 1959, she took charge of all the philanthropies to which he left his fortune. She served as a Trustee of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and chaired the Visiting Committee of the Metropolitan's Department of Far Eastern Art; she is credited with the idea for a Chinese garden courtyard, the [[Astor Court]], in the Metropolitan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=One Hundred Eleventh Annual Report of the Trustees The Metropolitan Museum of Art for the Fiscal Year July 1, 1980, Through June 30, 1981| date=October 19, 1981| publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Astor served as a member of the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial|Metropolitan Museum of Art's 100th Anniversary]] Committee and hosted the Metropolitan's Centennial Ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Finding aid for the George Trescher records related to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial, 1949, 1960-1971 (bulk 1967-1970)| date=13 June 2014| url=http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Trescher_Centennial_records_b18234550.pdf| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite liquidating the Vincent Astor Foundation in 1997, she continued to be active in charities and in New York's social life. The [[New York Public Library]] was always one of Astor's favorite charities, as was [http://www.amcny.org The Animal Medical Center]. In 1988, she was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].

==Elder abuse controversy==
{{See also|Elder abuse}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2007}}
The ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' ran a cover story July 26, 2006, describing the family feud between Brooke's son Tony and his son Philip Cryan Marshall, regarding Brooke's welfare. The story detailed how her grandson, a historic preservationist and associate professor at [[Roger Williams University]], had filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of his father as the socialite's guardian and the appointment of [[Annette de la Renta]], the wife of designer [[Oscar de la Renta]], instead.

According to accounts published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''Daily News'', Astor was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's Disease]] and suffered from [[anemia]], among other ailments. The lawsuit alleged that Marshall had not provided for his elderly mother and, instead, had allowed her to live in squalor and reduced necessary medication and doctor's visits, while enriching himself with income from her estate. Philip Marshall further charged that his father sold his grandmother's favorite [[Childe Hassam]] painting in 2002 without her knowledge and with no record as to the whereabouts of the funds received from the sale.  In addition to Annette de la Renta, [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[David Rockefeller]] provided affidavits supporting Philip Marshall's requests for a change in guardianship.

The day the story appeared, [[New York Supreme Court]] Justice John Stackhouse sealed the documents pertaining to the lawsuit and granted an order appointing Annette de la Renta guardian and [[JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.]] to be in charge of Brooke's finances. Several news organizations, including the [[Associated Press]] and ''The New York Times'', sued to have the records of the Astor case unsealed in the public interest; their request was granted September 1, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Kovaleski| first=Serge F.| title=Astor Painting Becomes Focus of Courtroom Battle| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/01/nyregion/01astor.html| work=The New York Times| date=1 September 2006| accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astor was moved to [[Lenox Hill Hospital]], where an unidentified nurse called her appearance "deplorable", according to the ''Daily News''. Brooke's son Tony unsuccessfully attempted to have his mother transferred to another hospital.

Brooke was released from [[Lenox Hill Hospital]] July 29, 2006, and moved to Holly Hill, her {{convert|75|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate in the village of [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]], where she died August 13, 2007.

Meryl Gordon's book, ''Mrs. Astor Regrets: The Hidden Betrayals of a Family Beyond Reproach'' (2008), makes use of diaries kept by the nurses who cared for Brooke during the last years of her life. The diaries were compiled over the four years Astor received care and detail the abuse that Mrs. Astor reportedly received from her son, Anthony (Tony).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-11-17/the-baby-monitor-diaries/1/| work=[[The Daily Beast]]| title=The Baby Monitor Diaries| last=Mason| first=Christopher| date=17 November 2008| accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip C. Marshall was tenured professor and director of historic preservation at [[Roger Williams University]] until 2017 when he left to dedicate his efforts, full-time, to elder justice as Founder of [http://beyondbrooke.org/ Beyond Brooke].

==Estate tampering==
''The New York Times'' reported August 1, 2006, that Anthony Marshall was accused by Alice Perdue, an employee in his mother's business office, of diverting nearly $1 million from his ailing mother's personal checking accounts into theatrical productions. Marshall, through a spokesman, said that his mother knew of the investments and approved of them. Perdue countered that Marshall had advised her never to send to his mother any documents of a financial nature because "she didn't understand it."

The claims made by Philip Marshall regarding his father's handling of the estate prompted interest in the matter.  The [[New York County District Attorney|New York District Attorney]] announced indictments on criminal charges against Tony and attorney Francis X. Morrissey Jr., November 27, 2007. The charges stemmed from the district attorney's office and subsequent grand jury investigation into the mishandling of Astor's money, and a questionable signature on the third amendment to her 2002 will, made in March 2004.  That amendment called for Astor's real estate to be sold and the proceeds added to her residuary estate. An earlier amendment, also made in 2004, which designated Marshall as the executor of his mother's estate and left him the entirety of the residuary estate, was also under investigation.&lt;ref name="indict"&gt;{{cite news| last=Kovaleski| first=Serge F.| title=Son of Astor Is Said to Face Criminal Case| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/27/nyregion/27astor.html?hp| work=The New York Times| date=27 November 2007| accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific charges included [[grand larceny]], criminal possession of stolen property, forgery, scheming to defraud, falsifying business records, offering a false instrument for filing, and conspiracy&lt;ref name="plunder"&gt;{{cite news| title=Brooke Astor's son accused of plundering estate| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21982146/| work=[[NBC News]]| date=27 November 2007| agency=Associated Press| accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in plundering her $198 million estate. The most severe charge, grand larceny, carries up to a 25-year sentence.&lt;ref name="plunder"/&gt;

The trial of Marshall and Morrissey started March 30, 2009, with the jury selection. The judge, Justice A. Kirke Bartley Jr., had originally indicated that the trial could last up to three months.&lt;ref name=trial&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/nyregion/31astor.html |author=John Eligon |title=Jury Selection Begins in Fraud Trial of Brooke Astor's Son |work=The New York Times |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After deliberations that stretched over 12 days and were reportedly marked by bitter disagreements that left one female juror claiming to feel personally threatened, the jury convicted Anthony D.

A '''business improvement district''' ('''BID''') is a defined area within which businesses are required to pay an additional tax (or levy) in order to fund projects within the district's boundaries.  The BID is often funded primarily through the levy but can also draw on other public and private funding streams.  BIDs may go by other names, such as '''business improvement area''' ('''BIA'''), '''business revitalization zone''' ('''BRZ'''), '''community improvement district''' ('''CID'''), '''special services area''' ('''SSA'''), or '''special improvement district''' ('''SID''').  These districts typically fund services which are perceived by some businesses as being inadequately performed by government with its existing tax revenues, such as cleaning streets, providing security, making capital improvements, construction of pedestrian and streetscape enhancements, and marketing the area. The services provided by BIDs are supplemental to those already provided by the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;Southeast Tennessee Development District, Chattanooga, TN. [http://www.sedev.org/downloads/GreenInfrastructureHandbook.pdf "Green Infrastructure Handbook."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320023034/http://www.sedev.org/downloads/GreenInfrastructureHandbook.pdf |date=20 March 2012 }} January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The revenue derives from a tax assessment on commercial property owners, and in some cases, residential property owners. 

==Development==
The first BID was the [[Bloor West Village]] Business Improvement Area, established in [[Toronto]] in 1970 as an initiative by local private business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jennifer | last = Yang | title = The birthplace of BIAs celebrates 40 years | date = 18 April 2010 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/797286--the-birthplace-of-bias-celebrates-40-years | work = Toronto Star | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first BID in the United States was the [[Downtown New Orleans|Downtown Development District in New Orleans]], established in 1974. There are now 1,200 across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Matson | first = Patricia | title = Wilmington Downtown hopes to emulate Big Easy’s success | work = Lumina News | publisher = Workin4U, Inc | date = 17 February 2011 | url = http://www.luminanews.com/article.asp?aid=7741&amp;iid=260&amp;sud=30 | accessdate = 7 August 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110929062559/http://www.luminanews.com/article.asp?aid=7741&amp;iid=260&amp;sud=30# | archive-date = 29 September 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries with BIDs include Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Jamaica, Serbia, Albania, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

The process for creating a BID varies from one jurisdiction to another. In the [[United States]], it generally involves three steps. First, some number of businesses in the area petition the local government to create the BID. Second, the local government determines that a majority of businesses want the BID. Third, the local government enacts legislation creating the BID. Prior to this occurring, state legislatures need to grant local units the authority to create BIDs.

BIDs in England and Wales are funded by a levy on the occupiers rather than the owners of the properties within the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=London Bids |title=Local authority guide to Business Improvement Districts |page=3 |date=October 2005 |url=http://www.ukbids.org/files/files/LA-BIDs.pdf |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008061849/http://www.ukbids.org/files/files/LA-BIDs.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; If voted in by local businesses, the BID levy is an extension to existing non-domestic business-rates. "In England and Wales, for a BID to go ahead the ballot must be won on two counts: straight majority and majority of rateable value. In Scotland for a ballot to be successful it must meet four criteria, a minimum turnout of 25% by the number of eligible persons (the headcount) and by rateable value and a majority of those that vote by number of ballots and by rateable value must vote in favour.  This ensures that the interests of large and small businesses are protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britishbids.info/AboutBIDs/WhatisaBID.aspx#AboutBIDs_BIDDev%20British%20Bids | title = What is a BID? | accessdate = 2010-10-12 | publisher = British BIDs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operating budgets of BIDs range from a few thousand dollars to tens of millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A BID may be operated by a [[nonprofit organization]] or by a [[Government-owned corporation|quasi-governmental]] entity. The governance of a BID is the responsibility of a board composed of some combination of property owners, businesses, and government officials. The management of a BID is the job of a paid administrator, usually occupying the position of an executive director of a management company.

==Distribution==

===United States===
{{main|Business Improvement Districts in the United States}} 
There are nearly 1,000 BIDs in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} New York City has 74 BIDs, the most of any city; in NYC, BIDs invest $134 million annually in neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/sbs/neighborhoods/bids.page|title=BIDs - SBS|website=www1.nyc.gov|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. BIDs exist in almost every one of the top 50 largest cities in the United States, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. Minneapolis and Boston have been the last of the top 20 largest regions to adopt a business improvement district. The State of Wisconsin has adopted the most for smaller towns, with about 90 in the state{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}, 25 of those being in Milwaukee and the rest throughout the state.

===Canada===
In Canada, Toronto has 81 BIAs within its city limit. [[Montreal]] – where BIAs are called Sociétés de Développement Commerciale (SDC) – has 17. The [[City of Winnipeg]] has 16 "Business Improvement Zones," the first of which were formed in 1987, with the amendment of The [[City of Winnipeg Act]]. In the province of [[Alberta]], they are termed "business revitalization zones". There are nine zones in the city of [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] and 10 in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]. Regina, Saskatchewan has two Business Improvement Districts: Regina Downtown (BID) and The Warehouse District. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan has 4 Business Improvement Districts: The Broadway BID, The Downtown Partnership, The Sutherland BID and The Riversdale BID. Some work has been made on creating a 5th BID in Saskatoon for the area of 33rd Street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130411232736/http://www.thestarphoenix.com/news/Push+continues+33rd+Street/8146530/story.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that there are over 400 BIDs in Canada but no count has been made. There are 8 business improvement districts in the Halifax Regional Municipality.  Halifax Regional Municipality has passed by laws in 2012 regarding the formation and conduct of these BIDs.
The 8 BIDS are: Downtown Halifax Business Commission, Downtown Dartmouth Business Commission, Spring Garden Area Business Association, North End Business Association, Quinpool Mainstreet and District Association Ltd. Sackville Business Association, Spryfield Business Association, Main Street Dartmouth Business Association.

BIDs have also become a powerful [[lobbying|lobby]] group, lobbying government for improvements such as new sidewalks, trees, park benches and other restorations. BIDs can also lobby different levels of government for a complete facelift on their area if they feel it is necessary to improve business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/293685399357911.php|title=Ottawa Business Journal|website=www.ottawabusinessjournal.com|accessdate=26 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011233655/http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/293685399357911.php|archive-date=11 October 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rideau Street BIA in [[Ottawa]] has lobbied the city for years to give the entire street a face-lift because of its "run down" look.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===British BIDs===

[http://www.britishbids.info www.britishbids.info] is the industry body focused entirely on Business Improvement Districts.  
The organisation offers advice and services on BID development, management and renewal along with a range of training services and the [http://www.britishbids.info/our-services/certificate-bid-management-2017/ Certificate in BID Management].

British BIDs conducts an annual [http://www.britishbids.info/publications/nationwide-bid-survey/ Nationwide BID Survey]. 2017 saw the publication of the 11th of these. The survey covers the fundamentals of a BID – number of businesses, types of businesses, levy rate and so on. It also asks questions about project delivery – what various BID's are delivering and how it works with other key strategic partners amongst other things. The survey provides the industry a real insight to the position at present.

British BIDs also produces the [http://www.britishbids.info/publications/industry-criteria/ Industry Criteria and Guidance] for developing and renewing BIDs alongside supporting organisations the  ATCM, Revo, ACS, BRC, intu and BPF.

British BIDs also administers the DCLG [http://www.britishbids.info/our-services/the-bid-loan-fund/ BID Loan Fund] which supports developing BIDs.

In February 2017, Professor Chris Turner was appointed Chief Executive of British BIDs.

British BIDs have a Comprehensive renewal support package called [https://britishbids.info/services/ballot-buddy Ballot Buddy] which gives absolute confidence that the regs are adhered to and not at risk of a challenge.

====England and Wales====
{{See also|List of business improvement districts in London}}
In [[England and Wales]], BIDs were introduced through legislation (the [[Local Government Act 2003]]) and subsequent regulations in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cook | first = I. R. | title = Mobilising urban policies: The policy transfer of US Business Improvement Districts to England and Wales | work = Urban Studies, 45 (4), 773–795. | url = http://research.northumbria.ac.uk/urbanfutures/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Cook-2008-Mobilising-urban-policies-Urban-Studies.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Circle Initiative, a five-year scheme funded by the [[London Development Agency]], set up the first pilot BIDs, five in London, all of which had successful ballots by March 2006. [[Association of Town Centre Management]]-coordinated pilot 'talking shops' in 22 locations in England and Wales corresponded with the development of BIDs' regulations. As of October 2007 there were 36 proposed or operational BIDs across Greater London. By late 2014, there were over 180 BIDs in operation in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BID Intel Stats | url = https://www.bidintel.co.uk/bid-stats/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2017, there were 270 BIDs in the United Kingdom.

The [[New West End Company]] is the management and promotional company for [[Bond Street]], [[Oxford Street]] and [[Regent Street]].
As one of the largest Business Improvement Districts (BID) in Europe, New West End Company brings together the commercial interests of over 600 retailers, property owners and West End businesses working closely with the [[Mayor of London]], [[Transport for London]], [[Westminster City Council]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] and local neighbours in a collective vision to drive forward the nations retail heartland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newwestend.com/about-us/about-us About Us | New West End Company]. Newwestend.com (2013-09-15). Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Better [[Bankside]] was the third BID to be established in the UK, the second in London and the first south of the river. It was founded in 2005, and underwent a successful re-ballot in 2010 with 82% of businesses in favour.&lt;ref {{cite web |url=http://www.betterbankside.co.uk/our-last-ballot |title=Our Last Ballot |publisher=Better Bankside |accessdate=22 December 2013}} It is also notable for having won numerous awards, including Best Visitor Information Initiatives Silver Award in 2008, the Best Community Project 2011 and Best Partnership Award 2012 in the [[Mayor of London]]’s BID Awards, and was short-listed for Best Marketing &amp; Communications Campaign [[TfL]] Smarter Travel Awards 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betterbankside.co.uk/ Making Bankside a better place to live, work and visit]. Better Bankside. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The Better Bankside BID was set up and is managed by [[The means]], a regeneration consultancy company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themeans.co.uk/ Welcome to]. The Means. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the Nottingham BID was successfully renewed by [http://www.centralmanagementsolutions.co.uk Central Management Solutions], a specialist management company for urban centres. This was particularly notable due to the fact that the BID merged the former leisure BID with the larger but, nonetheless, younger retail BID. The merger has led to combined services and aligned city promotions to consumers. 

In July 2015 the South Birmingham 'Lifford Bid' (Kings Norton, Cotteridge, Stirchley and Bournville) was rejected, with the Yes vote falling short with 45% of the vote.
 
====Scotland====
Business Improvement Districts Scotland (http://www.bids-scotland.com/) is the national organisation and voice for BIDs in Scotland. BIDS is responsible for delivering the Scottish Governments BIDs programme across Scotland, providing central support to developing BIDs, promoting and encouraging the development of BIDs across the country, whilst also working with operational BIDs to assist them in delivering for their local communities and contributing to sustainable inclusive economic growth. 

The Scottish Government provides a grant to local groups of up to £20,000 to help with the development of the BID. The legislation in Scotland (The Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006) is different from the England and Wales legislation in that it allows property owners as well as occupiers to be included in a BID. There are also differences in the timescales, ballot criteria (in Scotland for a ballot to be successful it must meet four criteria, a minimum turnout of 25% by the number of eligible persons (the headcount) and by rateable value and a majority of those that vote by number of ballots and by rateable value must vote in favour), reballot and the legislative requirements of the BID Proposer.  

The intention of the Scottish legislation is that BIDs are not restricted to towns and city centres to allow different and innovative BIDs to be developed across the country. The consultation of 2003 proposed that the BIDs model could be used in business parks, tourism and visitor areas, rural areas, agriculture and single business sectors. The legislation, and subsequent regulations were passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2006 and 2007 respectively. 

In March 2006, the Scottish Government announced funding for six pilot BIDs in Scotland, Bathgate (town centre), Clackmannanshire (business parks), Edinburgh (city centre), Falkirk (town centre), Glasgow (city centre) and Inverness (city centre). There are currently thirty seven operational BIDs in Scotland with a further twenty four in development. The thirty seven operational BIDs include thirty one town and city centre BIDs and three business park BIDs. 

In March 2014 the first tourism BID (TBID) was delivered in Loch Ness and Inverness (http://www.uniqueness.co.uk/)with others under discussion. The first themed BID in Scotland was delivered in December 2013, the Sauchiehall Street Evening Economy BID. In 2016 the worlds first Food and Drink BID was delivered in East Lothian (https://www.scotlandsfooddrinkcounty.com/) with the levy based on the number of full time employess, also a first. 

The development and interest in the BIDs model in Scotland continues to grow and the flexibility of the legislation and the model is now being recognised with the development of the Borders Railway BIDs Corridor and four Canal BIDs led by Scottish Waterways Trust. IN 2017 BIDs Scotland published The National Report on BIDs in Scotland (https://www.bids-scotland.com/about-us/the-national-report-on-bids-in-scotland-2017) which covers the types of BIDs, number of businesses, levels of employment in BIDs in Scotland and the contribution they make to sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The opportunity for more innovative BIDs is under discussion. 

===Germany===
Six of the sixteen German Bundeslander (Federal States) introduced the requisite legal framework to create BIDs: Hamburg, Bremen, Hessen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein. BID projects in implementation exist only in a few German cities, yet – e.g. in Flensburg, Hamburg and Giessen.

==Criticism==

Whilst BIDs have been heralded for improving the trading environment, BIDs have also received noteworthy criticism.

BIDs have been accused of being by their very nature undemocratic, and that they concentrate power in a geographic area into the hands of the few.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Batchis, Business Improvement Districts and the Constitution: The Troubling Necessity of Privatized Government for Urban Revitalization, 38 [[Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly|Hastings Const. L.Q.]] 91 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Small businesses who fall below the BID levy threshold, although not liable to pay the BID levy, are often priced out of an area because BIDs tend to increase rental values. Larger businesses are more able to absorb these rent increases, particularly the multiple stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irelandafternama.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/the-retail-sector-business-improvement-districts-and-increasing-rents/|title=The Retail Sector, Business Improvement Districts and Increasing Rents|date=22 February 2010|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIDs have also been criticized in the past by anti-poverty groups for being too harsh on the homeless and poor who may congregate around businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/14/nyregion/ex-outreach-workers-say-they-assaulted-homeless.html|title=Ex-Outreach Workers Say They Assaulted Homeless|first=Bruce|last=Lambert|date=14 April 1995|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIDs have also been known to be opposed to street vendors such as hot dog vendors and chip wagons.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In London, street traders who sold small items to tourists were barred from [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/street-traders-could-soon-be-barred-from-west-end-2029893.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Alistair | last1=Dawber | first2=Lydia | last2=Benatia | date=19 July 2010 | title=Street traders could soon be barred from West End}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President of [[Civic Voice]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] criticised the creation of a BID in central London neighbourhood saying that is undemocratic: "Neither the people who live there, nor the many intriguing small shops and businesses, have been allowed to vote or have even been consulted.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/dont-let-business-in-to-destroy-unique-fitzrovia-8069360.html|title=Don’t let business in to destroy unique Fitzrovia|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I am wary of this initiative because of what may become [[unintended consequences]] (or indeed intended consequences) that help one sort of business (the property letting business) but will cause problems to smaller businesses and the large and wholly integrated residential population of the district".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2012/07/24/fight-this-undemocratic-attempt-to-manipulate-fitzrovia-into-something-it-is-not/ Griff Rhys Jones "We need to fight this undemocratic attempt to manipulate Fitzrovia into something it is not" Fitzrovia News, 24 July 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised some of the methods to oppose the BID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2012/07/24/writer-and-actor-criticises-bid-proposal-and-graffiti-campaign-against-it/|title=Writer and actor criticises BID proposal and graffiti campaign against it|date=24 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3086">In [[project management]], a '''change order''' also referred to as a '''contract change note''' refers to the changes in the [[Scope (project management)|scope]] of work agreed to by the owner, contractor, and architect or engineer.

A change order is work that is added to or deleted from the original scope of work of a contract, however, depending on the magnitude of the change, it may or may not alter the original contract amount and/or completion date. A change order may force a new project to handle significant changes to the current project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/project-management-process-phase-3-implementing-change-control Project Management Process - Phase 3 - Implementing - Change Control]&lt;/ref&gt;

Change orders are common to most projects, and very common with large projects. After the original scope (or contract) is formed, complete with the total price to be paid and the specific work to be completed, a client may decide that the original plans do not best represent his or her definition for the finished project. Accordingly, the client will suggest an alternate approach.

Common causes for change orders to be created are:

* The project's work was incorrectly estimated
* The customer or project team discovers obstacles or possible efficiencies that require them to deviate from the original plan
* The customer or project team are inefficient or incapable of completing their required deliverables within budget, and additional money, time, or resources must be added to the project
* During the course of the project, additional features or options are perceived and requested.
* If the contractor has to add work items to the original scope of work at a later time in order to achieve the customer's demands, a fair price for the work items and fees must be added for the materials and labor. 
* Extreme weather conditions cause delays or require additional work to complete construction.

A [[project manager]] then typically generates a change order that describes the new work to be done (or not done in some cases), and the price to be paid for this new work. Once this change order is submitted and approved it generally serves to alter the original contract such that the change order now becomes part of the contract.

'''Charles Liebmann''' (November 16, 1837 – June 12, 1928) was a German-born American  brewer and president of S. Liebmann Brewery (later [[Rheingold Breweries]]) in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The brewery's main brand ''Rheingold Extra Dry'' was one of the most popular beer brands in [[New York City]] in the 1940s to 1960s.

==Biography==
Charles Liebmann was born to a [[German Jews|Jewish]] family in Schmiedelfeld in 1837, the son of Dara (née Selz) and [[Samuel Liebmann]]. His father was, at the time, the owner of the estate Schloss Schmiedelfeld. In 1840, the family moved to [[Ludwigsburg]] and ran the inn "Zum Stern" and its attached brewery; and where the young Liebmann attended secondary school. His father determined to immigrate to the [[United States]] for political reasons and sent Charles' brother in 1850 in advance to procure a home. In 1854, the remainder of the family immigrated settling in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]]. The family first operated the old ''Maasche Brewery'' while Charles worked as a [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]] at the ''[[F. &amp; M. Schaefer Brewing Company]]''. Pooling their resources, the family built a new brewery in [[Bushwick]] named the ''[[Rheingold Breweries|S. Liebmann Brewery]]''.

After the death of his father in 1872, the three sons took over the management of the brewery and renamed it ''S. Liebmann's Sons Brewing Company''. The Liebmann brothers alternated with each other as [[Chief Executive Officer]] each year. Charles Liebmann was considered the technical director of the company.
In 1903, the Liebmann brothers retired and handed over the management of the company to six of their sons.

==Personal life==
On October 22, 1865, Liebmann married Sophia Bendix; they had four children:&lt;ref name=Rolf&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/rolfhofmannf001#page/n27/mode/2up|first=Rolf|last=Hoffmann|authorlink=|title=Jewish Genealogy in Southern German Research Fragmants - Leibmann family|pages=|publisher=|date=|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chief visibility officer ''' ('''CVO''') or director of visibility is an individual appointed to oversee all aspects of performance across [[retail]] stores, [[corporations]] or organizations as part of the [[C-Suite]] of executives. The role of the CVO emerged to manage the integration of ideas, disciplines, technologies and people focused on elevating retail enterprise visibility. The title is commonly associated with [[Retail Loss Prevention]] (LP) leaders and professionals who maintain the highest position in security management and maintain the security operations in the store to achieve a high level of visibility.

==Role==
The CVO is focused on security systems as they contribute to higher profits and elevated store performance levels. The importance of the CVO position has risen as criminals and [[organized retail crime]] grows more sophisticated in thwarting security solutions.  According to the Centre for Retail Research Global Retail Theft Barometer 2011 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retailresearch.org/grtb_currentsurvey.php|title=The First Worldwide Shrinkage Survey 2011|publisher=Centre for Retail Research|year=2011 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total global shrink in 2011 cost retailers $119.092 billion, an average of 1.45% of global retail sales. The shrinkage rate was an average of 6.6% higher than 2010.   The losses are said to cost each family $199.89 per that year.   Working with security integrators to achieve maximum visibility into what takes place in a retail store on a daily basis allows the CVO to impact not only shrinkage numbers, but also to improve store operations. This approach was cited by the University of Leicester study on Effective Retail Loss Prevention, 10 Ways to Keep Shrinkage Low  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/criminology/people/bna/10WaystoKeepShrinkageLowpdf |title=Effective Retail Loss Prevention, 10 Ways to Keep Shrinkage Low|year=2007 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was noted that among the keys to reducing shrinkage in an organization included establishing a senior management commitment, ensuring organisational ownership, embedding loss prevention into the business and providing strong leadership.

==Challenges==
Shrinkage can occur in a number of different areas for a retailer: employee theft, including [[sweethearting]] [[shoplifting]]/organized retail crime, administrative error and vendor fraud.{{Cn|date=July 2016}} The goal of a CVO is to maximize business profits by reducing losses.{{Cn|date=July 2016}}  To accomplish this objective, CVOs analyze the full spectrum of store operations from employee and customer behavior to vendor and supplier patterns and supply chains.{{Cn|date=July 2016}} Integrated technologies can provide a comprehensive picture of customer behavior, staffing needs and merchandising trends, in addition to preventing losses for the store.{{Cn|date=July 2016}} The CVO must be in touch with core challenges across an organization to implement and integrate security solutions tailored to protect its unique vulnerabilities. According to securitysales.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Go Time In Retail |publisher=Security Sales and Integration |date=July 2, 2013 |url=http://www.securitysales.com/channel/vertical-markets/articles/2013/07/it-s-go-time-in-retail.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021232221/http://www.securitysales.com/channel/vertical-markets/articles/2013/07/it-s-go-time-in-retail.aspx |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; retailers are looking beyond standalone technology like [[electronic article surveillance]] (EAS) systems or cameras and access control and aiming to have visibility across the demand and supply chain.

'''Chung Mong-joon''' or '''Chung Mong Joon''' ({{lang-ko|정몽준}}, born October 17, 1951) is a South Korean businessman and politician. He is the sixth son of [[Chung Ju-yung]], founder of [[Hyundai]], the second-largest South Korean ''[[chaebol]]'' before its breakup in 2003. He remains the controlling shareholder of a Hyundai offshoot, [[Hyundai Heavy Industries Group]], parent of the world's largest shipbuilding company. He is also the chairman of the board of the University of Ulsan and [[Ulsan College]] in [[Ulsan]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Ulsan College"&gt;[http://www.ulsan-c.ac.kr/html/english/english_greet_1.html Ulsan College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722132723/http://www.ulsan-c.ac.kr/html/english/english_greet_1.html |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder and the honorary chairman of The [[Asan Institute for Policy Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Asan Institute for Policy Studies |title=About the Asan Institute |url=http://en.asaninst.org/about/about-the-asan-institute/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Honorary Vice-President of [[FIFA]] and president of the [[Korea Football Association|South Korean football association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FIFA President Joseph S.

==Political career and personal life==
Chung became a politician when he was elected as an assembly man in 1988 and served consecutive 7 terms in two different electoral districts. Initially he was elected in [[Dong District, Ulsan]] where predominant share of its population consisted of [[Hyundai Heavy Industries Group]]'s employees, its affiliated companies' employees, and their families. Most of other population in [[Dong District, Ulsan|Dong District]] run businesses related with serving those workers and their families. Chung served as a representative of this particular district for 20 years. He joined [[Grand National Party]] in 2007 shortly before 2007 South Korean presidential election, declaring his support to that party's presidential candidate [[Lee Myung-bak]]. As a member of [[Grand National Party]], he switched his electoral district to [[Dongjak District]], [[Seoul]], and represented there as an assembly man for 2 terms until 2014 when he had to give up that seat to run for mayor of Seoul, but the election was lost to [[Park Won-soon]] leaving no political titles for Chung after.

===Presidential campaign of 2002===
In 2002, he ran for the presidency, but later gave up his candidacy supporting [[Millennium Democratic Party]]'s candidate [[Roh Moo-hyun]]. Their coalition was motivated to prevent [[Grand National Party]] from winning the presidential election. South Korean regionalism became much more serious and antagonistic under President [[Kim Dae-jung]]'s term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004439079 초점 영남권에 근거없는 유언비어 확산, 연합뉴스 01-21-1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=047&amp;aid=0000018992 경남권 "노무현 고향은 전라도" 소문 파다&lt;주간조선&gt; "10대조부터 김해 거주" 보도, 오마이뉴스 12-13-2002 ]&lt;/ref&gt; President Kim is the only South Korean president coming from [[Jeolla]] province, whereas all the other South Korean presidents since General [[Park Chung-hee]]'s [[May 16 coup|military coup]] in 1961 have been from [[Gyeongsang]] province.

Chung participated in Roh's presidential campaign up to the last day before the election, Dec 19, 2002. On Dec 18 afternoon, before the crowd of his supporters in [[Myeong-dong]], [[Seoul]], Roh suggested [[Chung Dong-young]] and [[Choo Mi-ae]] as viable choices of candidates for the next presidential race in 2007. Roh suggested those Democratic Party's politicians when he saw some of the crowd having slogans "Chung Mong-joon for the next presidential candidate" Roh's suggestion was not intended to exclude Chung as a presidential candidate, but to encourage and to praise his party's politicians in return to their supports to his presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0000292316 與盧 파기발단 문제발언 해명, 연합뉴스 12-19-2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chung's joining of [[Grand National Party]] is an irony because his withdrawal from the presidential race in 2002 supporting [[Roh Moo-hyun]] was responsible for [[Grand National Party]]'s failure in winning the presidential election. The party's candidate [[Lee Hoi-chang]] received absolute support from conservative or anti [[Jeolla]] voters. By the help of Chung's withdrawal, the election became bipolar between Roh and Lee, and Roh turned out to be a winner receiving exclusive support from reform-minded Korean voters. [[Grand National Party]] had to wait another 5 years to produce a president from this defeat. Also his declaration to support [[Lee Myung-bak]] when he joined [[Grand National Party]] is an irony. When Chung's father [[Chung Ju-yung]] ran for the presidency in 1992, [[Lee Myung-bak]] supported [[Kim Young-sam]] instead of [[Chung Ju-yung]] despite the fact that Lee made fortune and fame when he worked at Hyundai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=115&amp;oid=214&amp;aid=0000046725 이명박, 샐러리맨 성공신화, MBC TV 08-21-2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-today.co.kr/200707/news/newsview.php?TM=news&amp;SM=0101&amp;idxno=150000 이명박-현대家, 앙금 풀어지나?, 이투데이 12-20-2007]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chung Ju-yung]] even bought him a luxurious house when Lee worked for [[Chung Ju-yung]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0004995928 李 대통령 "시민으로 돌아간다"…논현동 자택 복귀, 뉴시스 02-24-2013]&lt;/ref&gt; So Chung supported his father's ex subordinate who in fact hadn't supported his father in earlier presidential race.

Chung's brother [[Chung Mong-hun]], then the president of [[Hyundai Asan]] who pioneered South and North joint [[Mount Kumgang]] tour business, committed suicide on Aug 4, 2003 when he was investigated by prosecutors for his alleged $400 millions cash remit to [[North Korea]] shortly before 2000 [[Inter-Korean summit|North-South summit]].

In his autobiography which was published in 2011, Chung argues that President Roh didn't refuse [[Grand National Party]]'s demand of investigation because he believes Roh actually wanted to investigate his brother to revenge on his withdrawal of supporting Roh in [[South Korean presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;[http://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=6729144  나의도전 나의열정 (정몽준의 인생과 세상 이야기), 정몽준 저, 김영사 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another ironical point behind Chung's joining of [[Grand National Party]]. The party tried to dig and disclose Chung's private life information to defame him in [[South Korean presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]]&lt;ref name="Private"&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=047&amp;aid=0000017072 정몽준 '사생활'을 캐라!한나라, 'MJ 흑색선전' 문건 논란, 오마이뉴스 11-25-2002]&lt;/ref&gt; These included his alleged prior diagnosis of mental disorder in school years, his cheating incidence during final exam in college years, questionable identity of his real mother, discredit of his [[Johns Hopkins University]] doctoral degree, and etc.&lt;ref name="Private" /&gt; Some of these rumors have turned out to be true. In conclusion Chung settled at the party which had been at odds with him before.

Chung was known to be suspended and repeat courses for cheating final exam when he was a freshman in [[Seoul National University]].&lt;ref name="커닝"&gt;[http://www.businesspost.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1928  Who Is ? 정몽준 전 새누리당 의원, 비즈니스포스트 05-15-2014]&lt;/ref&gt; He was caught by an exam monitor when he was peeping at some other classmate's exam over shoulder during final exam.&lt;ref name="커닝" /&gt; He was reported to disciplinary committee and got such punishment after the incidence. Chung gave an excuse for this, saying he cheated final exam trying to finish it early to go out with his friends.&lt;ref name="커닝" /&gt; Chung is the only known public figure in Korean history having such record.

Chung's real mother is unknown. When he ran for the South Korean presidency in 2002, [[Grand National Party]] explored this point.&lt;ref name="Private" /&gt; They speculated about the identity of Chung's real mother. They speculated that his real mother could be a house maid, a [[geisha]], or a particular traditional musician whom [[Chung Ju-yung]] had an affair with.&lt;ref name="Private" /&gt; In fact, in his interview with news reporters in 2002, Chung indicated that his real mother is someone else, saying he would reveal the truth someday.&lt;ref name="Mom"&gt;&gt;[http://woman.donga.com/docs/magazine/woman/2002/10/07/200210070500045/200210070500045_1.html 대선 출마 선언하며 자신의 출생 비밀 솔직하게 털어놓은 정몽준의원, 여성동아 10-01-2002]&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that he was crying when he was questioned about his real mother.&lt;ref name="Mom" /&gt; Chung explained about his real mother in his autobiography in 2011. Chung says that when he studied in US in 1978, he received a letter from someone in Korea who claimed to be his real mother. He hurried to return to Korea, and met her at her place, according to his autobiography. Chung says this was the first and last for him to see that woman.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

===Presidential campaign of 2012===
Shortly after he published his autobiography in 2011, some South Korean media reported an allegation that his shipbuilding company bought a large sum of his autobiography in order to make it known as a best seller.&lt;ref name="사재기"&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/498883.html  “정몽준 자서전 현대중 직원 동원 ‘사재기’”, 한겨레 10-02-2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The media gathered that information after interviewing inside personnel, and found that [[Hyundai Heavy Industries Group]] distributed [[gift certificates]] to thousands of their employees to purchase Chung's autobiography.&lt;ref name="사재기"/&gt; It was reported that they required employees to return the books along with receipts to the company after purchase, and added a special instruction not to purchase large volumes at once for fear of getting suspicions from public.&lt;ref name="사재기"/&gt;

On top of publishing his autobiography, Chung also donated huge sums of money and set up a charity foundation in 2011, a year before 2012 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/08/113_92888.html Is Chung gearing up for a presidential bid?, The Korea Times 2011.08.16]&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed $200 million worth of Korean won from selling approximately 5% of his assets and established the Asan Sharing Foundation, which offers educational opportunities and financial assistance to young people from low income families. He said he funded it to commemorate his late father [[Chung Ju-yung]], but many couldn't dismiss reasonable suspicion that his motivation was to impress the public before the presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=10110817185249 정몽준 '통 큰 기부'? 워렌 버핏 '부자 증세' 한마디에, 프레시안 2011.08.17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2011/08/202_92959.html Corporate philanthropy, The Korea Times 2011-08-17]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Chung didn't deny such suspicion, arguing that donation is supposed to good regardless of purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.com/common/redirect.jsp?category_id=020601000000&amp;news_id=20110817000523 (Editorial) New charity foundation, The Korea Herald 2011-08-17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.co.kr/nocut/Show.asp?IDX=1889429 정몽준, 수전노에서 자린고비로 승격, 노컷뉴스 2011.08.17]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chung didn't think of [[Park Geun-hye]] as accomplished as himself before 2012 presidential election.

Chung is losing popular support in South Korean politics now. When he ran for assemblyman in 2008, he received 54.41% of votes in [[Dongjak District]], but for the following election in 2012, he just received 50.80% barely surviving to lose to the opposition candidate. When he ran for [[mayor of Seoul]] in 2014, he received 43.03% votes from Seoul residents, losing to then incumbent [[mayor of Seoul]] and previous civil rights activist [[Park Won-soon]], who received 55% of the total vote. It turned out that Chung's electoral district, [[Dongjak District|Dongjak]] voted only 41.80% for Chung whereas it gave 57.45% for [[Park Won-soon|Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyeongin.com/?mod=news&amp;act=articleView&amp;idxno=864663 서울시장 박원순 당선인, 22개구 승리… 정몽준 지역구 동작서도 앞서, 경인일보 06-05-2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Cognitive Information Processing (CIP) Approach to Career Development and Services'''&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, G. W., Sampson, J. P., Jr., &amp; Reardon, R. C. (1991). Career development and services: A cognitive approach. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Sampson, J. P., Jr., Reardon, R. C., Peterson, G. W., &amp; Lenz, J. G. (2004). Career counseling and services: A cognitive information processing approach. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Peterson, G. W., Sampson, J. P., Jr., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Lenz, J. G. (2008). Cognitive information processing model. In F. Leong (Ed.), Encyclopedia of counseling. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; is a theory of career problem solving and decision making that was developed through the joint efforts of a group of researchers at the [[Florida State University]] Career Center's [http://www.career.fsu.edu/techcenter/ Center for the Study of Technology in Counseling and Career Development]. 

CIP theory asserts that the major components involved in determining career decision-making and problem-solving effectiveness are the content and process of career decisions. The importance of the content and process in career decision making can be described by using a metaphor of a recipe. To make a good dish (decision) one must have all necessary ingredients (content), and know how to follow cooking instructions (process).

==Description==
In terms of career problem solving and decision making, the CONTENT includes everything one must KNOW to make an effective decision, including knowledge about oneself (values, interests, skills, employment preferences), knowledge about options; knowledge about decision-making skills—and knowledge about the thoughts, emotions, and metacognitions (self-talk, self-awareness, monitoring and control) that are involved.  Each of these areas are categorized into domains of information processing, which include the Knowledge Domain (self-knowledge and options knowledge), the Decision-Making Skills Domain, and the Executive Processing Domain (thoughts, emotions, and metacognitions). An analogy of a computer can be used to describe how these domains interact to determine decision-making effectiveness.  The Knowledge Domain is similar to the files of information stored on a computer, the Decision Making Skills domain is similar to a computer's hardware and software that make use of the files in a meaningful way, and the Executive Processing Domain can be likened to a computer's brain or motherboard that dictates the computer's overall functionality. These domains are depicted through a diagram of a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194759/http://career.fsu.edu/occupations/careerdecisionindex.cfm pyramid].

The process involves everything one must do to make an effective decision, including: defining the gap between where one is and where one wants to be, gaining a better understanding of oneself and one's options, expanding and narrowing a list of options, valuing and prioritizing remaining options resulting in a first choice, executing the choice by developing a plan of action for implementation, and reflecting back upon the choice. This process can be broken down into five stages ('''C'''ommunication, '''A'''nalysis, '''S'''ynthesis, '''V'''aluing, '''E'''xecution) which form the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719195031/http://career.fsu.edu/occupations/careerdecisiondecisions.cfm CASVE decision-making cycle] that one continually navigates throughout their career development.

Practical application of CIP theory&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Lenz, J. G., &amp; Reardon, R. C. (1992). A cognitive approach to career services: Translating concepts into practice. Career Development Quarterly, 41, 67-74.&lt;/ref&gt; has evolved since 1971 into a cost-effective, self-directed approach to career service delivery currently in use at the [http://www.career.fsu.edu/ FSU Career Center] and in many other settings both nationally and globally. The CIP approach is intended to translate theory into practice to help individuals make appropriate current career choices, and learn improved problem-solving and decision-making skills needed for future choices.  The CIP approach to career-service delivery includes a number of key elements that can be incorporated by any career center or career-service program as long as certain assumptions are met (multiple staff members, variety of available resources, etc.).

==Key Elements==
The key elements of the CIP approach are broken down into a seven-step service delivery model:

1. Screen individuals for career decision-making readiness before delivering services&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Lenz, J. G. (2000a). Using readiness assessment to improve career services: A cognitive information processing approach. The Career Development Quarterly, 49, 146-174.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increases the likelihood that the services delivered are congruent with individual needs
* Allows staff to serve more individuals with brief interventions
* Allows more time to deliver intensive interventions to assist individuals with extensive needs
* Helps to understand why individuals are seeking career assistance and judge their decision-making readiness
* If no concrete request for information is made and a potential problems is indicated (indecision, confusion, or disabling emotions), then more comprehensive screening is likely needed

2. Match level of staff assistance to identified individual needs
* Individuals who have a high level of readiness for decision making are referred to self-help career services, where they select, locate, sequence, and use needed resources with little assistance from staff
* Individuals who have a moderate level of readiness for decision making are referred to brief staff-assisted services, where the staff member and client collaboratively plan the use of resources and services necessary to solve the career problem
* Individuals who have a low level of readiness for decision making are ideally referred to individual case-managed services
* The resulting net effect of the CIP approach is to limit expensive services (in terms of staff resources) to individuals with more extensive needs

3. Use career theory to help individuals understand and manage career decision making
* Helps the practitioner decide how much and what type of assistance individuals need to solve career problems
* Helps individuals understand the content and process of career decision making to create a cognitive framework which helps reduce ambiguity, manage information, and provide clear criteria for self-monitoring of progress

4. Use print and online career resources within all levels of service delivery
* Provides individuals with self-help access to resources that meet identified learning needs
* Resources should be used to augment brief staff-assisted and individual case-managed services
* The effectiveness of a career resource room is dependent on having a classification schema and index for organizing and identifying resources, and a comfortable physical space to use resources

5. Use career resources that are appropriate for diverse individual learners
* Resources available in the career resource room should be appropriate for the inherent diversity in individuals’ verbal [[aptitude]], [[motivation]], and [[learning styles]]
* In terms of verbal aptitude, it is particularly important for resources to be available in a wide range of readability
* In terms of motivation and learning style, traditional text-based resources need to be supplemented with video and interactive computer-based resources that may be more reinforcing for some learners
* Care also needs to be taken that individuals’ physical disabilities do not prevent them from accessing resources in career resource rooms, and web sites should be accessible through text readers for persons with visual disabilities

6. Use staff teamwork in delivering services to individuals
* Clients being served with brief staff-assisted services work with a variety of different staff members to solve a career problem.
* Continuity in service delivery resides in the collaboratively developed Individualized Learning Plan (ILP)
* Benefits to the individual include not being restricted to the available appointment times of any one practitioner, and being able to decide how quickly they will use available resources and services
* Staff members must be able to quickly establish helping relationships, clarify client progress in completing the ILP, and subsequently revise the ILP if new needs emerge

7. Provide common staff training for delivering resources and services
* Common training experiences among staff are needed to reduce the likelihood of inconsistent or disjointed service delivery when multiple staff serve one individual
* All staff must be familiar with the theoretical basis of service delivery to help clients understand and manage the career decision-making process
* Staff must be competent in the use of career assessment, intervention planning, information, and instructional resources

==Relationship to Cognitive Therapy==
CIP theory is based on [[cognitive therapy]]&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A. T. (1976). Cognitive therapy and the emotional disorders. NY: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; concepts developed by [[Aaron Temkin Beck|Aaron Beck]], which specify that dysfunctional cognitions have a detrimental impact on behavior and emotions.  Through cognitive restructuring, collaborative empiricism, attention to emotions, and the development of an effective helping relationship, clients learn to replace dysfunctional cognitions with functional cognitions, resulting in positive changes in behavior and emotions. Dysfunctional cognitions have been determined to interfere with the different components of the CIP approach (self-knowledge, options knowledge, communication, analysis, synthesis, valuing, execution, and executive processing); and the assumptions, attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, feelings, plans, and/or strategies related to career problem solving and decision making must be considered when providing career counseling services.

==Related Assessment Tool==
The Career Thoughts Inventory (CTI)&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Lenz, J. G., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Saunders, D. E. (1996a). Career Thoughts Inventory. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Lenz, J. G., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Saunders, D. E. (1998). The design and use of a measure of dysfunctional career thoughts among adults, college students, and high school students: The Career Thoughts Inventory. Journal of Career Assessment, 6, 115-134.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed to measure dysfunctional career thoughts, and an accompanying workbook&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Lenz, J. G., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Saunders, D. E. (1996b). Career Thoughts Inventory workbook. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (Improving Your Career Thoughts: A Workbook for the Career Thoughts Inventory) was created to help clients restructure and improve their career thinking.  The CTI was developed to integrate the functions of assessment and intervention within a career service delivery context by linking the measure and workbook in such a way that clients can more effectively incorporate the assessment concepts into intervention strategies for change.

The CTI is designed to be used with high school juniors and seniors who may be choosing a post-secondary field of study, choosing an occupation, or seeking employment; college students who may be choosing a major field of study, choosing an occupation, or seeking employment; and adults who are considering an occupational or employment change, seeking employment due to unemployment or underemployment, or reentering the labor market after a substantial period of non-paid work. The readability of the CTI and the CTI Workbook was calculated to be at a 6.4 and 7.7 grade level, respectively.

To facilitate quick completion, scoring, and instrument profiling, and avoid service delivery delays or disruptions, the CTI combines the inventory, answer sheet, and profile form into one booklet.  The Test Booklet can be quickly scored by clients, human service practitioners, or clerical support staff. The CTI Profile is printed on the back page of the booklet.

In service delivery, the CTI can be used by practitioners to help adults, college students, and high school students identify, challenge, and subsequently alter dysfunctional thinking that impairs their ability to effectively solve career problems and make career decisions. Specifically, the CTI can be used as an instrument for screening and needs assessment, as well as a learning resource in delivering career services. The CTI Professional Manual&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Lenz, J. G., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Saunders, D. E. (1996c). Career Thoughts Inventory: Professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; provides additional details on the use of the CTI and CTI Workbook, including specific strategies for individual counseling, group counseling, self-directed career decision making, workshops and curricular interventions.

The [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] (internal consistency, stability), [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] (content, construct, convergent), and factor structure of the CTI have been well established. A number of empirical studies have been conducted and have found strong relationships in the expected directions between dysfunctional career thoughts various other constructs (vocational identity, certainty, and knowledge about occupations and training, indecision, neuroticism, vulnerability, angry hostility, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, comfort with choice, lack of information needs, anxiety, depression, self-clarity, decision-making style, cognitive thought patterns, emotional intelligence, symptoms of trauma, self-efficacy, satisfaction with occupational choice, attachment anxiety and avoidance, and others.

The CTI was designed to be quickly administered (most clients complete the 48 CTI items in 7 to 15 minutes) and scored (and scored in 5 to 8 minutes).  As a result, the CTI can be used as part of a brief intake procedure or during an initial session. The CTI Workbook presents interpretive information for all four scales with text, metaphors, and illustrations that practitioners can use to facilitate interpretation of CTI results.  The workbook also has several components that can be assigned as [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]], such as cognitive restructuring of negative thoughts, developing an individual action plan for using career resources and services, and learning about the decision-making process.  Finally, the CTI Test Booklet and the CTI Workbook are relatively inexpensive to purchase and the hand scoring feature eliminates scoring processing fees.

'''Craig S. Fleisher''' is a scholar, 
advisor and author who has written or edited several important books in the fields of public affairs, business insight and competitive intelligence and [[Competitor analysis|analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;(Amazon.com, 2008; JCIM, 2003 volume 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the Business School at the [[College of Coastal Georgia]], he was awarded two endowed research chair positions while a Professor of Business (Strategy &amp; Environment) at the [[Odette School of Business]], [[University of Windsor]], [[Ontario]], Canada. His research addresses phenomena in the areas of business and [[competitive intelligence]], [[Public Affairs Council|corporate public affairs]] (government relations and [[lobbying]]), and performance management and measurement. Since 2011 Dr. Fleisher has served as the Chief Learning Officer of Aurora WDC, a 20+ year old professional services firm (PSF) headquartered in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;(aurorawdc.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background, education and academic career==
Fleisher received his PhD in Business from the [[Katz Graduate School of Business]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], his MBA in Human Resource Management and Marketing from the [[Vanderbilt University Owen Graduate School of Management|Owen Graduate School of Management]], Vanderbilt University, and BSBA in Finance, Insurance and Real Estate from the [[University of Florida]]. He also held positions in mortgage banking management, [[real estate appraisal]], and management consulting at various points in his career. After getting his PhD, he took an appointment at the [[University of Calgary]] as Associate Professor in the Policy and Environment area, spent nearly a decade in various professorial and program leadership roles at the School of Business and Economics at [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], and was at the [[University of Windsor]] in endowed chair position for nearly a decade, following a couple of years in decanal positions at the [[University of New Brunswick]]. He serves as an Adjunct Professor in Business Information Management at [[Tampere University of Technology]] (Finland), Adjunct Professor at the [[Wisconsin School of Business]], [[University of Wisconsin]] in Madison, imember of the graduate faculty for the Executive MScom at the [[Università della Svizzera italiana]] in [[Lugano, Switzerland]], has also served as a visiting professor or scholar at the [[University of Sydney]] ([[Australia]]), [[De Montfort University]] (Leicester, UK), [[University of Western Sydney]]¨and [[University of Waikato]] (Hamilton, New Zealand), among others.

He is considered an expert in the business or [[competitive intelligence]] and analysis area&lt;ref&gt;(Dishman, Fleisher &amp; Knip, 2002; Fleisher, Wright &amp; Tindale, 2007; Fleisher, Knip &amp; Dishman, 2003; Knip, Dishman, &amp; Fleisher, 2003;&lt;/ref&gt; based on the number of cited pieces (see [[Google Scholar]] for the most current citation counts of his work) he has written or the level of sales his writings have achieved, as well as in the area of corporate public affairs&lt;ref&gt;(Allen, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; where his books have been positively reviewed or named as best-sellers by leading associations and groups in the field. He was globally recognized for his lifetime contributions to the field of competitive intelligence by being named the Meritorious award winner and Fellow of the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] (Alexandria, Virginia, USA),&lt;ref&gt;(SCIP, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and his efforts in graduate teaching led him to be named one of Canada's top MBA professors by ''[[Canadian Business Magazine]]'' in 2006. He has been interviewed about his expertise and research by leading media outlets for magazines, narrow-cast web publications, newspaper, radio and television in a variety of countries, most notably Australia, Canada, and the USA.

==Research and writing==
Fleisher's academic research primarily focuses on two distinct areas of business activity, business and competitive intelligence, and corporate public affairs. Fleisher's dissertation was in the area of measuring public affairs performance,&lt;ref&gt;Fleisher, Craig (1991). "''Modeling the Role of Evaluation and Measurement in the Achievement of Corporate Public Affairs Management Effectiveness''" (OCLC: 28924435), 1991, Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt; and his research on public affairs benchmarking, performance measurement, and management is among the most cited according to [[Google Scholar]] in this field.&lt;ref&gt;Dishman, Fleisher, &amp; Knip, 2003; Fleisher, Wright &amp; Tindale, 2007; Fleisher, Knip &amp; Dishman, 2003; Knip, Dishman, &amp; Fleisher, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; His two books on these topics, published in 1995 and 1998 by the [[Public Affairs Council]] which is headquartered in [[Washington, DC]] were recognized as the Council's best-sellers at their time. His other major contributions in the field of corporate and public affairs are the two scholarly handbooks "The SAGE Handbook of International Corporate and Public Affairs" in 2017 and the ''Handbook of Public Affairs'' ([[SAGE Publications|Sage]], 2005) with his colleague Dr. Phil Harris from [[University of Chester]], [[United Kingdom]].

Since 2000, Fleisher is well known for his work in the area of business insights and [[competitive intelligence]], particularly in pushing for the professionalization of the field.&lt;ref&gt;(Fleisher, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; He published 3 edited volumes with his [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] [[Marketing]] professorial colleague David Blenkhorn, those being ''Managing Frontiers in Competitive Intelligence'' in 2001 (Quorum Books, an imprint of the [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]),  ''Controversies in Competitive Intelligence'' published in 2003 and ''Global Business and Competitive Intelligence'' in 2005 by [[Praeger Publishers]].

The only [[Canadians|Canadian]] Winner of the international [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] Meritorious Award for his lifetime contributions to the field of competitive intelligence, he may be best known for his two books looking at analysis methods used by consultants and practitioners in applied strategy. This included ''Strategic and Competitive Analysis'' with his colleague and fellow SCIP Meritorious Award winner [[Babette Bensoussan]] [[(Prentice Hall]], 2003) and ''Business and Competitive Analysis'' also with Bensoussan, (2Ed., [[Pearson PLC]], 2015, and [[FT Press]], 2007), and "Analysis without Paralysis" (w/Bensoussan, 2nd Ed., [[FT Press]], 2015). These books provided background and application information for over 50 separate methods of understanding business phenomena and competition,&lt;ref&gt;(Fleisher &amp; Bensoussan, 2003; Fleisher &amp; Bensoussan, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from popular methods like [[SWOT analysis]], financial ratio &amp; statement analysis, [[critical success factor]] analysis, issue analysis, and S-curves to less popular but no less important methods including business model analysis, linchpin analysis, and alternative competing hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;(Booknews, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; These books also address [[competitor analysis]].

'''Denis O'Donnell''' (28 May 1875 - 16 June 1933) was a well-known entrepreneur in [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]], in the early 1900s. 
[[Image:Denis OD.jpg|frame|Denis O'Donnell, founder of the Lee Strand Creamery]]

==Background==
He was born in Tubrid, [[Ardfert]], County Kerry, to Patrick O'Donnell of Tubridmore, and Bridget (née Griffin) of Lerrig. He was a grandson of John O'Donnell of Ardfert, who lived at Tubridmore, and descended from O'Donnells of [[Tyrconnell]], following on the implantation of O'Donnells in Ardfert by Prince [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell]] en route to the [[Battle of Kinsale]] in 1601, as recorded in the [[Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland]]. He wrote poetry as a hobby. He initially farmed a family farm at Tubrid until he left to [[Ballyhaise College|Ballyhaise]], an agricultural college.&lt;ref&gt;''Writer recalls Tralee youth'', interview with Patrick Denis O'Donnell (Denis's son), published in '''The Kerryman''', August 15, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Hannah Leane, from Ballintobeenig, and they had one child, [[Patrick Denis O'Donnell]]. He died of an accident when his son Patrick was only 11 years old, and his widow, Hannah, subsequently emigrated to the [[United States of America]] at the outbreak of [[World War II]], when their son, Patrick, joined the [[Irish Defence Forces]].

==Education==
Denis O'Donnell was schooled in Tubrid, in Spa, and later in Chapeltown national schools, and then farmed some years before proceeding to study and become one of the first graduates of [[Ballyhaise College]], [[County Cavan]], Ireland, with a Diploma in Dairy Science, having studied there from 1908 to 1910. This was the only such qualification available in the country at the time.

==Business career==
In his early career he was manager in some small creameries, one in [[County Tipperary]], and others in  Black Abbey, [[Adare]], [[County Limerick]]; in Dicksgrove, Farranfore, and  BallymcElligott, and Ballydwyer in [[County Kerry]]. He was influenced by the cooperative movement being driven by Sir [[Horace Plunkett]], well described in the account of country life of the times by Elizabeth, Countess of [[Fingal]]l, ''Seventy Years Young''.  Sir Horace Plunkett, MP, and later Senator of the [[Irish Free State]], third son of Lord Dunsany, was father of the Irish agricultural co-operative movement, and founded the [[Irish Agricultural Organisation Society]] (now the [[Irish Co-operative Organisation Society]]), which included several hundred creameries. Accordingly, Denis O'Donnell actively organised farmers in the early [[cooperative movement]] in County Kerry, and founded the Lee Strand Co-operative Creamery on April 20, 1920 in Church Street, [[Tralee]], still a going concern in 2009 although it relocated to Ballymullen in 1992. He owned a pub at #2 Edward Street, Tralee, run by his sister Bride, until her emigration to Kimberly, South Africa. The pub was sold in 1938. He also owned shops in Rock Street and Castle Street in Tralee. He was the first to introduce the [[pasteurisation]] of milk, much against the prejudice of dairy farmers at the time, and also was the first to market [[ice-cream]] in Tralee.

His entrepreneurial streak and outreach to farming communities provided a socio-economic complement to the political mobilisation undertaken by his kinsman, [[Thomas O'Donnell, M.P.]] for West Kerry, who campaigned for agrarian reforms. [[Maurice Moynihan]], father of [[Maurice Gerard Moynihan]], was a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], was Thomas O'Donnell's campaign manager and was a cousin of Denis O'Donnell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20632">The '''E.H. Harriman Award''' was an annual award presented to [[United States|American]] [[rail transport|railroad]] companies in recognition for outstanding [[occupational safety and health|safety]] achievements.

==History==
The award was founded in 1913 by [[Mary Williamson Averell|Mary Averell Harriman]], wife of the late [[E. H. Harriman|Edward H. Harriman]].  After her death, the award was presented by her sons [[E. Roland Harriman]] and [[W. Averell Harriman]].  Today the award is sponsored by the [[E.H. Harriman Memorial Awards Institute]].
On January 5, 2012, UP announced to its employees that for the first time in ninety-eight years the Harriman award would be retired after the 2012 award ceremony. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) made the decision to end the award presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railwayage.com/breaking-news/commentary-was-it-time-for-the-harrimans-to-go-3867.html |title=COMMENTARY: Was it time for the Harrimans to go?  |author=WILLIAM C. VANTUONO |date=January 10, 2012 |work= |publisher=''Railway Age'' |accessdate=January 13, 2012}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
While the awards were intended to encourage safe operating practices and safety enhancements, the awards have also occasionally been the source of some labor disputes.  Part of the award criteria has been a count of the number of reported workplace injuries as tracked by the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA); this has led to disciplinary action and even dismissal for employees at some railroads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes| date=September 1999| url=http://glo.bmwe.org/public/journal/1999/09sep/a03.htm| title=BMWE Journal: FRA Committee Reviewing Safety Award Criteria| accessdate=January 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several rail [[trade union|labor union]]s objected to the criteria, going so far as to picket the award ceremonies.  [[Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes]]&lt;!--Note, "Employes" spelling is correct --&gt; (BMWE) General Chairman Paul Beard created the "Harassment Award" as a satire of the Harriman Awards to raise awareness of management practices that bred intimidation and disciplinary actions against reporting accidents.  In 1999 the FRA invited discussions with representatives of rail labor unions to discuss the problem.

==Recipients==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2009}}
Railroad companies are grouped into one of four categories:
* Group A railroads are line-haul railroads with greater than 15&amp;nbsp;million employee hours per year.
* Group B railroads are line-haul railroads with between 4 and 15&amp;nbsp;million employee hours per year.
* Group C railroads are line-haul railroads with less than 4&amp;nbsp;million employee hours per year.
* Group S&amp;T railroads are switching and terminal railroads

The award presentations are normally made in May of the year after the award designation; for example, the 2004 awards were presented in May 2005.  Past recipients of the E.H. Harriman Award were:

'''Edward Stephen Harkness''' (January 22, 1874 – January 29, 1940) was an American [[philanthropist]]. Given privately and through his family's [[Commonwealth Fund]], Harkness' gifts to private hospitals, art museums, and educational institutions in the Northeastern United States were among the largest of the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, pp. 1238, [[Columbia University Press]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philanthropists and Foundation Globalization, By Joseph C. Kiger (2008),  pp 39&lt;/ref&gt; His was a major benefactor to the [[Columbia University]], [[Yale University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], [[St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], as well as the [[University of St Andrews]] in Scotland.

Harkness inherited his fortune from his father, [[Stephen V. Harkness]], whose wealth was established by an early investment in [[Standard Oil]], and his brother, [[Charles W. Harkness]].&lt;ref name="NYT1916"&gt;{{cite news |title=C. W. Harkness Left $1,700,000 Estate |newspaper=New York Times |date=9 May 1916 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/05/09/104674549.pdf |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, he was ranked the 6th-richest person in the United States by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's first "Rich List", behind [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[Henry Clay Frick]], [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[George Fisher Baker]], and [[William Rockefeller]].

==Biography==
Harkness was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], one of four sons of [[Anna M. Harkness]] and [[Stephen V. Harkness]], a harness-maker who invested in and was one of the five founding partners in the forerunner of [[Standard Oil]], [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s oil company. Stephen Harkness died when Edward was fourteen, leaving his wife and oldest son, Charles, to manage the estate.&lt;ref name="Towler"/&gt; Harkness attended [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] and [[Yale College]], Class of 1897 and [[Columbia Law School]]. Harkness, his brother [[Charles W. Harkness|Charles]], and cousin [[William L. Harkness|William]] were members of [[Wolf's Head (secret society)|Wolf's Head Society]] at Yale.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps Association Membership Directory, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harkness House, 1908.jpg|thumbnail|Harkness House in New York, now home of The Commonwealth Fund]]
After graduating, Edward Harkness married Mary Stillman, daughter of wealthy New York attorney Thomas E. Stillman, in 1904. Mary's maternal grandfather was George Greenman, a shipbuilder in [[Mystic, Connecticut]], who founded George Greenman &amp; Co. Harkness' mother gave the couple a [[Edward S. Harkness House|new Italian Renaissance mansion]] on the Upper East Side as a wedding present. As the building's architect, Harkness chose Yale College classmate [[James Gamble Rogers]], who would later design many of his philanthropic building projects. The home, at 75th Street and 5th Avenue and now known as the Edward S. Harkness House, became the headquarters of Harkness' [[Commonwealth Fund]] after Mary's death.

Harkness briefly served as a railroad director for the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], but within several years decided to become a full-time philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Education: Old Blue |magazine=TIME |date=19 February 1940 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763536,00.html |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began making gifts to the Egyptian collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1912, and that same year was appointed to the museum's Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perry |first=Lewis |title=Edward and Mary Harkness |journal=Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |date=October 1951 |volume=10 |number=2 |pages=57–59 |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257488.pdf.bannered.pdf |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harkness' older brother Charles died in 1916 at age 55, leaving Edward more than US$80 million, much of it in Standard Oil stock.&lt;ref name="NYT1916" /&gt; Charles had continued to invest substantially in [[Standard Oil]] as manager of the family fortune, and his brother's estate made Harkness the third-largest stakeholder in Standard Oil.&lt;ref name="NYT1916" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Towler"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Harkness made charitable gifts totaling more than $129 million, the equivalent of $2 billion in 2005 dollars. His philanthropic peers [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]] gave respectively $550 million and $350 million.&lt;ref name="Towler"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Towler |first=Katherine |title=The Men Behind the Plan |magazine=Exeter Bulletin |date=Fall 2006 |pages=25–33 |url=http://collegiateway.org/pdf/towler-2006.pdf |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical philanthropy===
[[File:NYP Eye Center.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia]]

Harkness encouraged and orchestrated the merger of [[Presbyterian Hospital (New York City)|Presbyterian Hospital]] and Columbia University's [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeon]]s, creating Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC), the world's first [[academic medical center]].

The campus was built in the 1920s on the site of [[Hilltop Park]], the one-time home stadium of the [[New York Yankees]], which Harkness purchased and donated.  Despite his aversion to have anything named for himself, The Edward Harkness Eye Institute was named by relatives.

In 1997, Columbia-Presbyterian merged with the [[New York Hospital]].  New York hospital had affiliated with [[Cornell University]]'s [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] in the 1930s, following their lead. Now known as [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]] / Columbia University Medical Center, The Harkness Pavilion, named for father Stephen, is a central part of the campus.

===Arts philanthropy===
[[File:Standing Hippopotamus MET DP248993.jpg|thumb|333x333px|"William," the faience hippopotamus, early second millennium B.C.]]
Harkness and his mother, Anna, gave substantial sums to several important [[non-profit]] enterprises. Harkness was a major benefactor of the [[New York Public Library]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Preston_Remington_records_b18157099.pdf Finding aid for the Preston Remington records, 1925-1970], Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 25 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Harkness, in addition to donations to the Decorative Arts Department, gifted the Museum's initial [[Ancient Egyptian art]] collection. Harkness bought the complete [[Tomb of Perneb]] for the Met and helped purchase the [[George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon|Carnarvon Collection of Egyptian artifacts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gelfand |first=Aleksandr |title=This Weekend in Met History: October 28 |date=26 October 2012 |website=Now at the Met |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/now-at-the-met/features/2012/this-weekend-in-met-history-october-28 |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated the Met's unofficial mascot, a [[William the Faience Hippopotamus|blue decorative hippo]] from the Egyptian [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom's Twelfth Dynasty]]. It is known as "William."

===Educational philanthropy===
In 1917, a year after Charles' death, Anna Harkness donated $3 million to Yale University to build the [[Harkness Memorial Quadrangle|Memorial Quadrangle]] student dormitory in Charles' memory. In 1918, Anna Harkness established the [[Commonwealth Fund]] with an initial gift of $10 million, and Harkness was made its president.

Harkness and his wife made many contributions to educational buildings, including [[St Salvator's Hall]] at the [[University of St. Andrews]]; Harkness Chapel and Harkness Dormitory at [[Connecticut College]]; [[Butler Library]] at [[Columbia University]] as well as the original portions of the [[Columbia University Medical Center]] and the undergraduate dormitories at [[Brown University]]&lt;ref&gt;The Half Opened Door, Marcia Graham Synnott, 1979), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Connecticut College]] - all of these were built through his philanthropy or that of his wife, Mary.

Between 1926 and 1930, Harkness made major donations to Yale and Harvard to establish [[residential college|residential college systems]] at each school. Harkness admired the [[collegiate university|colleges]] of Oxford and Cambridge in England and proposed to [[List of Presidents of Yale University|Yale President]] [[James Rowland Angell]] that he would fund a smiliar system for Yale's [[Yale College|undergraduate college]] to relieve overcrowding and improve social intimacy.&lt;ref name="Schiff"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schiff |first=Judith Ann |title=How the colleges were born |magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine |date=May–June 2008 |url=https://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/2108/how-the-colleges-were-born|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Yale Corporation]] failed to accept Harkness' offer by 1928, Harkness went to Harvard with a similar offer. Harvard's president, [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]], quickly accepted, and eight houses for [[Harvard College]] were completed by 1931 with a $10 million gift from Harkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Harkness and History |magazine=Harvard Magazine |date=November 2011 |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/11/harkness-and-history |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dismayed, Yale administrators appealed to Harkness to reconsider his offer, and in 1930 he agreed to give Yale $11 million for nine [[residential colleges of Yale University|residential colleges]] of its own.&lt;ref name="Schiff"/&gt; Harkness persuaded Yale to retain his friend [[James Gamble Rogers]] as the colleges' architect. He also made gifts that established the [[Yale School of Drama]], the first independent drama faculty in the country, and erected its theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelley |first=Brooks Mather |title=Yale: A History |year=1999 |edition=2nd |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time as his Yale-Harvard philanthropy, Harkness sought to reform the pedagogical techniques of the country's elite boarding schools. At [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], he sought to innovate beyond [[rote learning]] by introducing the [[Harkness table]] method of instruction. Through further gifts, the method spread to [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul’s]], [[Lawrenceville School|The Lawrenceville School]], and [[Kingswood-Oxford School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wooster |first=Martin Morse |title=Edward Harkness |website=The Philanthropy Roundtable |url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/almanac/hall_of_fame/edward_harkness |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harkness also made gifts to [[Taft School]], [[The Hill School (Pennsylvania)|The Hill School]] and [[Phillips Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;The Exeter Bulletin, Fall 2006, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

He established the [[Harkness Fellowship]]s and founded the [[Pilgrim Trust]] in the UK in 1930 with an endowment of just over two million pounds, "prompted by his admiration for what Great Britain had done in the 1914-18 war and, by his ties of affection for the land from which he drew his descent."&lt;ref&gt;Trust Deed, quoted on [http://www.thepilgrimtrust.org.uk/ the Pilgrim Trust website], accessed 4 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The current priorities of the trust are preservation, places of worship, and social welfare.

==Residences==
[[File:HarknessAerial.jpg|thumbnail|Harkness Eolia Mansion in [[Waterford, Connecticut]]]]
Edward and Mary Harkness had a number of homes in addition to Harkness House in New York. They spent summers at their Eolia mansion on Long Island Sound in [[Waterford, Connecticut]], near where Mary had visited her grandparents in the summers. The home and {{convert|230|acre}} of ornamental gardens and grounds are now maintained by the State of Connecticut as [[Harkness Memorial State Park]].

They also owned another house on Long Island in [[Manhasset, New York]] on 186 acres called ''Weekend,'' designed by architect [[James Gamble Rogers]], plus houses in North Carolina and California, and a camp in the Adirondacks. They also spent time at the [[Jekyll Island Club]]  in Georgia and Yeamans Hall outside of Charleston, SC - another James Gamble Rogers golf and winter community.

==Burial==
He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City, [https://www.pinterest.com/pin/368380444492018942/] which is today a National Historic Landmark.  The Harkness family mausoleum is stately and includes a privately walled and locked garden.  The mausoleum does not have any name at all on it noting who is buried inside.  The architecture of the mausoleum evokes that of a small medieval church [https://web.archive.org/web/20150912054100/http://magnificentmausoleums.blogspot.com/2012/04/harkness-mausoleum-built-in-1924.html]

Harkness was honored with a three-page spread in the Yale Banner and Pot Pourri published by the Yale Class of 1940 for his contributions to the University in particular and the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;Yale Banner and Pot Pourri - New Haven, Yale Class of 1940, pgs. 5 - 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In addition to the family funded foundations, Harkness (along with another wealthy neighbor, Edward Crowninshield Hammond) was the inspiration for [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s off-stage character "Harker", the "Standard Oil millionaire", in ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'', and on-stage figure "T. Stedman Harder" in ''[[A Moon for the Misbegotten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, Robert M. ''Critical Companion to [[Eugene O'Neill]]: a literary reference to his Life and Work'' pg. 614.Facts on File, [[New York City|New York]] {{ISBN|978-0816066759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His flagship bank, BII or [[Bank International Indonesia]], bankrolled many of his other ventures that made him at one time the king of [[copra]].

==Early life==
Eka Tjipta Widjaja was born '''Oei Ek Tjhong''' in 1921 in Quanzhou, Fujian (Fukien) Province, China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Richest people in indonesia |url=http://www.top10rich.com/indonesia.html |website=Top10rich.com |publisher=Top10rich.com |accessdate=14 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172739/http://top10rich.com/indonesia.html |archivedate=8 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the son of a [[Sulawesi]] (Celebes)-based trader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Studwell|first1=Joe|title=Books on Google Play  Asian Godfathers: Money and Power in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia|date=2008|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=0-87113-968-5|pages=255–256|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=720iFSxkII8C&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Indonesia when he was 9 years old, and started selling biscuits at 17.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eka Tjipta Widjaja &amp; family|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/eka-tjipta-widjaja/|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes.com LLC|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Mr. Widjaja received his honorary Doctorate degree in Economics from [[Pittsburg State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eka Tjipta Widjaja|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=36417830&amp;privcapId=12048784|accessdate=13 May 2015|agency=Bloomberg|publisher=Bloomberg LP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He has since retired from the limelight and handed his business over to his children, in particular Indra, Teguh and Franky and grandson Eric Oei Kang, who headed up the Hong Kong-listed construction company Creator Holdings. Hong Kong Creator Holdings is now one of Hong Kong's most well known and prominent companies, with many projects in Asia.  Widjaja's second son, Singapore tycoon [[Oei Hong Leong]], is one of Southeast Asia's richest men, ranked by Forbes Magazine as #37, with a net worth of US$355 million.

Widjaja bought a [[Beverly Hills]] mansion in 2009 from [[Donald Trump]] for $9.5 million.&lt;ref name="reve_Asma"&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6874">The '''Fair Credit Billing Act''' (FCBA) is a [[United States]] [[federal law]] enacted in 1974 as an amendment to the [[Truth in Lending Act]] (codified at {{usc|15|1601}} et seq.).  Its purpose is to protect consumers from unfair billing practices and to provide a mechanism for addressing billing errors in "open end" [[Credit (finance)|credit]] accounts, such as [[credit card]] or [[charge card]] accounts.&lt;ref name = "FTC Facts"&gt;{{cite web | title = Disputing Credit Card Charges | publisher = Federal Trade Commission | date = August 2012 | url = http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0219-fair-credit-billing | accessdate = 2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of billing errors==
The following are examples of billing errors under the FCBA:&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Charges not actually made by the [[consumer]]
* Charges in the wrong amount.
* Charges for goods or services not received by the consumer
* Charges for goods not delivered as agreed
* Charges for goods that were damaged on delivery
* Failures to properly reflect payments or credits to an account
* Calculation errors
* Charges that the consumer wants clarified or requests proof of
* Statements mailed to the wrong address
* Significantly not as described product/goods

==Correction of billing errors==
The FCBA allows consumers to dispute billing errors by sending a written notice of the dispute to the creditor.  To trigger duties under the Act, a person must send a written dispute via mail to the "billing inquiries" address on their credit card statement, not the address for sending payments.&lt;ref name = "FTC Facts" /&gt;  This dispute must be received by the creditor within sixty days of the statement date on the account statement that first contained the billing error.&lt;ref name = "FTC Facts" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Intro to Business|last1= Dlabay|first1= Les R. |last2=Burrow |first2=James L. |last3=Brad |first3= Brad |year= 2009|publisher= South-Western [[Cengage Learning]]|location= [[Mason, Ohio]]|isbn=978-0-538-44561-0 |page= 470|quote= To get correction of an error, you must notify the creditor in writing within 60 days after your statement was mailed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notice given by telephone is not sufficient to trigger the protections of the FCBA; a consumer can only protect their rights under the Act by sending a written notice, or online if the creditor indicates to consumers that it will accept notices electronically.&lt;ref name="AMDLaw"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amdlaw.com/ConsumerLaw/FairCreditBillingAct.aspx | title = Fair Credit Billing Act | publisher = Andrew M. Doktofsky, P.C. | accessdate = 2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wklawyers.com/blog/consumer-debt-and-bankruptcy/fair-credit-billing-act/ |title=The Fair Credit Billing Act |last=Kapetan |first=Alex |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829025620/http://wklawyers.com/blog/consumer-debt-and-bankruptcy/fair-credit-billing-act/ |archivedate=2013-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks may accept disputes by phone while warning their customers that phone complaints do not preserve the customer's rights under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/security-faq.go | title = Credit Card FAQs - View Questions about: Security | accessdate = 2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often leads to a [[chargeback]] to the vendor.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

After receiving notice of a dispute, the credit issuer must acknowledge the dispute within thirty days, investigate the claim and, within ninety days, either make appropriate corrections to the account or send a letter to the consumer explaining why the creditor believes there was no error.  If the creditor responds that they believe there was no error, the consumer can request copies of documentation supporting the validity of the disputed items.&lt;ref name = "FTC Facts" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "AMDLaw" /&gt;

==Other regulations of the FCBA==
In addition to creating a mechanism for dealing with billing errors, the FCBA contains additional regulations, including the following:

* Billing statements must be sent at least fourteen days before the payment is due for open end credit accounts that have a grace period prior to adding finance charges.&lt;ref name = "FTC Facts" /&gt;
* If banks report payments as delinquent to credit bureaus they must also report a charge is disputed.&lt;ref name = "AMDLaw" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1666a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Credit card companies may not prohibit merchants from offering discounts to people who pay with cash or check.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1666f}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Banks may generally not use money in checking or savings accounts to pay a delinquent credit account with the same bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1666h}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The FCBA's § 170 gives a consumer the right to sue or assert defenses against the credit company (instead of the actual merchant) in a dispute about the quality of goods or services received, to the dollar extent of the amount of the charge(s) involved.&lt;ref name = "FTC Facts" /&gt;''(The dollar amount of the charge must exceed $50, and the purchase must have been made in the consumer's home state or within 100 miles of their address (unless the creditor is affiliated with the merchant, in which case these restrictions do not apply).  The consumer must also make a [[good faith]] attempt to resolve the dispute prior to invoking this right.)''

== Enforcement of the FCBA ==
The [[Federal Trade Commission]] is the "overall enforcing agency" for purposes of administrative enforcement, though compliance by banks is enforced under section 8 of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consumer may also file a private lawsuit in any state or federal court with [[jurisdiction]] over the parties to recover actual damages, [[statutory damages]] of double the erroneous finance charge(s), and his or her costs and attorney fees (if the claim is successful).  If the alleged unlawful conduct is widespread, the consumer can also seek to file a [[class action suit]] and seek damages up to the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]] (FDCPA)
* [[Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act]] (FACTA) - amended the FCRA.

'''Franco Belgiorno-Nettis''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AC|CBE}} (20 June 1915 – 8 July 2006) was an [[Australia]]n industrialist and patron of the arts. He founded the construction and engineering company [[Transfield]] and also helped establish the Australian Biennale subsequently known as the [[Biennale of Sydney]].&lt;ref name=NPG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens/&gt;

==Biography==
Belgiorno-Nettis was born in [[Cassano delle Murge]] in the [[Province of Bari]] in [[Apulia]], [[Italy]] in 1915 and attended the Turin Military Academy before joining the Italian army and serving in [[North Africa]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/an-achiever-whose-dreams-came-true/2006/07/10/1152383674252.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=11 July 2006 |title=An achiever whose dreams came true |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109012742/http://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/an-achiever-whose-dreams-came-true/2006/07/10/1152383674252.html?page=fullpage |archivedate=9 January 2016 |first=Tony |last=Stephens}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent 3 years at an allied [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]] in [[India]]. After the war he returned to Italy to complete his studies in engineering at the [[University of Turin]]. In 1951 he came to Australia as the employee of Italian engineering firm Electric Power Transmission, (an offshoot of Milan-based Societa' Anonima Elettrificazione), which was constructing powerlines.

Franco Belgiorno-Nettis and Amina Cerino-Zegna wed by proxy in 1951 &amp;ndash; Belgiorno-Nettis' brother represented him at the altar of Turin Cathedral for the marriage.  Amina soon after joined her husband in Australia, and their three sons, Marco Belgiorno-Zegna, Luca Belgiorno-Nettis and Guido Belgiorno-Nettis, were born between 1953 and 1959.&lt;ref name=NPG&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.portrait.gov.au/people/amina-belgiorno-nettis |publisher= National Portrait Gallery |title= Amina Belgiorno-Nettis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 he and his professional partner, [[Carlo Salteri]], set up [[Transfield Services|Transfield]] which became the largest construction and engineering firm in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/the-deal-magazine/transfields-luca-belgiornonettis-branches-into-information-technology/news-story/be2114283dbc9ec64ac853687425d933 |newspaper=The Australian |date=15 May 2015 |title=Transfield’s Luca Belgiorno-Nettis branches into information technology |first=Tom |last=Dusevic |publisher=News Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also prominent as a patron of the arts. In 1961 he set up the [[Transfield Art Prize]].&lt;ref name=Stephens/&gt; He also helped to found the [[Biennale of Sydney]] in 1973.

Franco Belgiorno-Nettis died in 2006 aged 91 either after a fall while on holiday in Italy,&lt;ref name=Stephens/&gt; and/or of a terminal brain stroke while attending to home maintenance in Italy.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

'''Gallahadion''' (March 31, 1937 – July 7, 1958) was an [[United States|American]] [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] best known as the 1940 winner of the [[Kentucky Derby]]. He was a son of the [[Leading sire in North America|Champion]] [[Father|sire]] [[Sir Gallahad III]], and his damsire was [[Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year|U.S. Horse of the Year]] [[Reigh Count]], who won the 1928 Kentucky Derby. Owned by [[Ethel V. Mars|Ethel V. Mars']] [[Ethel V. Mars#Milky Way Farm Stable|Milky Way Farm Stable]], named for [[Mars, Incorporated|her company's]] famous [[Candy bar|chocolate bar]] brand, Gallahadion raced at age three in [[California]]. Although he was unplaced in the [[Santa Anita Derby]] and the [[San Juan Capistrano Handicap]], after winning the 1940 [[San Vicente Stakes]] and finishing second in the [[Derby Trial]], Gallahadion was entered in the [[Kentucky Derby]].

==Triple Crown races==
In the Kentucky Derby, [[Edward R. Bradley|Edward R. Bradley's]] colt [[Bimelech]], the 1939 [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse|U.S. 2-Year-Old Champion]], was the overwhelming favorite, [[gambling|bet]] down to 40¢ on the dollar. Mioland, owned by [[Charles S. Howard]] of [[Seabiscuit]] fame, was a very distant second choice at more than 6:1 odds. Given almost no chance, Gallahadion was sent off as a 36:1 longshot but under [[jockey]] [[Carroll Bierman]] scored an upset over Bimelech. For owner Ethel V. Mars, whom [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849957,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; reported had been spending more money on horses than any other American racehorse owner, Gallahadion was her eighth horse to run in the Derby in the past six years. Previously, Mrs. Mars' best results came in 1935 and 1937 when her horses finished third. A severe cold kept her at home and she was not at [[Churchill Downs]] to see her horse capture the one race she had wanted to win most of all. In the second and third legs of the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S. Triple Crown]], Bimelech won both races. Gallahadion finished third in the [[Preakness Stakes]], then found the extra distance in the 1½ mile [[Belmont Stakes]] too much and was unplaced.

During the remainder of 1940, Gallahadion met with little success, as he did the following year when he raced at age four.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14608">'''Inter-municipal cooperation''' ('''IMC''') is a generic term for all joint provision of public services between municipalities, who are normally but not necessarily neighbours.

Municipalities are elements of administration and have a history of several hundred years in Europe.&lt;ref name=Hulst&gt;{{cite book|last=Hulst|first=Rudie|title=Inter-Municipal Cooperation|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Amsterdam|isbn=1-4020-5378-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One speaks of IMC when two or more municipalities work together to provide a public service, where cooperation ranges from coordinated behaviour to joint ventures. As territorial consolidation often fails because of political resistance, inter-municipal cooperation is a way to keep public services efficient and effective without territorial consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Local Government and Public Reform Initiative|title=When is IMC relevant?|url=http://www.municipal-cooperation.org/index.php?title=When_is_IMC_relevant%3F|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BelWarner&gt;{{cite web|last=Bel, Germa, and Mildred E. Warner (2015)|title=Inter-municipal Cooperation and Costs: Expectation and Evidence|url=https://cardi.cals.cornell.edu/sites/cardi.cals.cornell.edu/files/shared/documents/RED/Intermunicipal%20Cooperation%20and%20costs.pdf|publisher=Public Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, IMC can have high failure rates when coordination problems between municipalities in steering and monitoring cannot be resolved.&lt;ref name=Voornetal&gt;{{cite web|last=Voorn, Bart, Marieke L.

== History ==
Cooperation of municipalities is a contemporary phenomenon. A historic example of inter-municipal cooperation is the Hanseatic League,&lt;ref name=FES&gt;{{cite web|last=Froecker|first=Hans-Joerd|title=Interkommunale Zusammenarbeit|url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/akademie/kommunal/05825.pdf|publisher=Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by municipalities in Northern Europe and lasted from the 13th to the 17th century. Following the Industrial Revolution, as cities grew rapidly and the requirements concerning public services increased, inter-municipal cooperation became increasingly popular. While cooperation was initially without obligation, with the beginning of the 20th century IMC was increasingly legally codified.

== Benefits and Barriers ==
=== Benefits ===
IMC is used to increase efficiency and effectiveness in providing public services.&lt;ref name=BelWarner /&gt; The joint financing and operating of these services can cut costs and achieve economies of scale and scope, which becomes increasingly important in smaller and more rural municipalities. IMC can also allow capital investment that would be unaffordable otherwise, and eliminates duplicate efforts. A major advantage in Europe is that the European Union is providing incentives for municipal partnerships.

=== Barriers ===
The most important barrier for inter-municipal cooperation is lack of trust or coordination between the partners, and if these cannot be overcome, failure rates of IMC can be high.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; Politicians and citizens may (rightfully) fear a loss of control over the service.&lt;ref name=Spicer&gt;{{cite web|last=Spicer, Zachary (2017)|title=Bridging the accountability and transparency gap in inter-municipal collaboration|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03003930.2017.1288617|publisher=Local Government Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the lack of trust, the often complicated legal structure of IMC can be a barrier. Citizens may also worry that cooperation is a step towards consolidation or amalgamation.

== Types of Inter-municipal Cooperation ==

=== Coordinated Behaviour ===
Coordinated behaviour is the lowest level of inter-municipal cooperation. Both entry and exit are voluntary and non-binding.&lt;ref name=LeRouxetal&gt;{{cite web|last=LeRoux, Kelly, Paul W. Brandenburger, and Sanjay K. Pandey (2010)|title=Interlocal service cooperation in US cities: A social network explanation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02133.x/full|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples for coordinated behaviour are combined strategies for tourist development.

=== Public Contract ===
Public contracts are more binding than a coordinated behaviour. The costs for the formation of this cooperation are low as only the legal consulting may result noteworthy costs. However, failure rates can be high when contracts are incomplete.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; This kind of cooperation is typically chosen when the service is similar for each of the participants, like one town settles the snow plowing service for one or more other towns and receives a certain amount of money in return. Such inter-municipal contracting is particularly common in the United States.&lt;ref name=BelWarner /&gt;

=== Administration Unit / Special District ===
In this model, the participants of the intermunicipal cooperation found and own the administration unit or special district. They transfer the right to provide the public service to the newly formed unit. As well as the service, the unit will have the right to raise the fees for this service, if such fees were previously raised by the participating municipalities. As these units need clear defined rights and obligation the effort to form them is much higher, and they are not possible in all countries.&lt;ref name=HMWVL&gt;{{cite web|last=Hessen Ministry of Economy, Traffic and Development|title=Interkommunale Kooperation|url=http://www.stadtumbau-hessen.de/tiny_docman/files/Pub_Interk_Koperation.pdf|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disposal services and water supply may be organised in this fashion in some countries.

=== Private Limited Company ===
Private law units such as companies or foundations can be used as well. Some countries, so as Germany, allow the municipals the ownership of private companies only if the purpose of the company is an economical not a public service. The easiest way to form a company by private law is the [[private limited company]]. It is easy and fast to found and the liability is limited to the assets of the company. However, while research shows such cooperation can be effective and efficient, the complexity of contracts in such arrangements can also lead to high failure rates.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt;

=== Public Limited Company ===
To organise an intermunicipal cooperation with a public law unit such as a [[public limited company]] is one of the least used possibilities. Although the PLC shares the advantages of the Private Limited like limited liability the higher administration and financial effort makes the PLC rather unattractive for IMC. Besides that the PLC is often very difficult to control by the owners what rules is almost out for IMC. Just like private limited companies, public limited companies may have a high complexity of contracts that can also lead to high failure rates.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt;

== Phases of implementing IMC ==
The phases to implement an IMC can be divided in up to 14 phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishing IMC|url=http://www.municipal-cooperation.org/index.php?title=Establishing_IMC|publisher=Local Government and Public Reform Initiative|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually it is enough to distinguish four phases: the analysis of the needs, the analysis of the effects, the implementation and the evaluation.

At first one has to perform a needs assessment to find the areas in which IMC can benefit the participants. What is needed is an exact specification of the goals the IMC should achieve. The parties have to realize what they want and make sure that the partner has similar goals. Especially in the area of public services, where there is a constant dialogue with citizens about these services, it is important to make the process and the goals as transparent as possible. Citizens can be involved in the process of forming the IMC by using workshops or panel discussions.

After that, a feasibility study is needed to analyse the economic, operational and administrative efforts and benefits. If the service to be organised as an IMC already exists, it needs to be exactly specified. All the facts flow into the negotiation of the agreement, whether it is a contract, an administrative unit or a private company. At this point the involved parties should be clear about the form of financing the IMC. It can be advisable to seek legal advice as IMC can become legally very difficult in some countries.

When everything is fixed in contracts the participants can start to realise the project. As well as in the first phase of the IMC implementation it is important to communicate the process to all involved parties. Especially when problems arise, transparent behaviour is needed to sustain trust between the involved parties.

After the successful implementation of the project, the parties should negotiate certain progress of improvement an adjustment to changing environmental conditions. It is advisable to establish the “change management” in the contract between the involved parties. There should be a periodical evaluation of the IMC so that changed prerequisites will be noticed.

== Inter-municipal Cooperation in international area ==

=== Belgium ===
By a framework decree of 2001, inter-municipal cooperation was reformed by the [[Flemish]] Government. A variety of forms of inter-municipal cooperation were legally implemented. Beside that certain elements of supervision were implemented, to ensure control by the municipal councils. The framework insists on the "purity" of IMC, so municipalities shall be involved primarily.&lt;ref name=Hulst /&gt;

=== Finland ===
Especially in the thinly populated [[Finland]] inter-municipal cooperation has been an effective tool to ensure public services at reasonable cost. Finnish local governments are self-governing with a large variety of responsibilities. Due to this fact the services provided by the municipals are numerous. Even service competition between municipals is quite common in Finland.&lt;ref name=Hulst /&gt;

=== France ===
[[France]] was long time mainly governed by a central state. Within the last century the municipals gained more and more autonomy. Nevertheless inter-municipal is often performed on voluntary basis. As discussing about territorial consolidation is politically hazardous in France, IMC becomes more and more important to maintain public services at reasonable costs.&lt;ref name=Hulst /&gt;

=== Germany ===
Inter-municipal cooperation has a long history in [[Germany]]. In the administrative system of Germany (State, Federal States, Communities) the municipals have to finance their services themselves. Therefore municipals have a natural interest in providing public services efficiently.&lt;ref name=Hulst /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In contrast to other European Countries local governments are highly restricted in the United Kingdom. Therefore inter-municipal cooperation is not that common in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly, Josephine (2007)|title=The Curious Absence of Inter-municipal Cooperation in England |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0952076707078763|publisher=Public Policy and Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although municipalities have the authority to perform public services they often do not have the possibility to raise additional fees.&lt;ref name=Hulst /&gt;

=== United States of America ===
There are 39,000 local governments United States and 22,000 have under 2,500 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Michael E.|title=Inter-municipal Cooperation in the USA|url=http://government.cce.cornell.edu/doc/pdf/UPER6artWARNER.pdf|publisher=Urban Public Economics Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides providing public services themselves, municipalities in the USA have used privatization (contracting out) and cooperation with neighbouring municipalities for a long period of time. Cooperation is used to maintain independent identities and still achieve economies of scale. Most of the cooperative ventures are single-function (education, water, housing, transport).

'''John Francis''' "'''Jack'''" '''Trouts''' (January 31, 1935 – June 4, 2017) was an owner of Trout &amp; Partners, a [[Consultant|consulting]] firm. He was one of the founders and pioneers of [[positioning (marketing)|positioning]] theory and also [[marketing warfare strategies|marketing warfare theory]].

==Career==
Trout started his business career in the advertising department of General Electric. From there he went on to become a divisional advertising manager at Uniroyal.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/business/jack-trout-dead-marketing-strategist-product-positioning.html?_r=0 |title=Jack Trout, Who Fought for Consumers' Minds and Money, Dies at 82 |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |authorlink=Richard Sandomir |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then he joined [[Al Ries]] in the advertising agency and marketing strategy firm where they worked together for over twenty-six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marketing guru talks about differentiation: Jack Trout holds court with a packed audience at AirTime 500 Fall Expo |author=John R.

He was the [[President|founder and president]] of the [[International marketing|international marketing strategy]] firm "Trout and Partners". The firm is represented in offices in many countries worldwide including [[emerging markets]].&lt;ref name="Tulsa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marketing wizard due in Tulsa: Internationally known Jack Trout will address the Tulsa Advertising Federation |first=Debbie |last=Blossom |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-143398382.html |newspaper=[[Tulsa World]] |date=March 18, 2006 |accessdate=April 13, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trout worked with a number of different client companies, including AT&amp;T, Apple, Citicorp, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble, Southwest Airlines and Xerox. When working with [[pizza]] chain [[Papa John's]], Trout was majorly involved in the invention of the chain's slogan "better ingredients, better pizza".&lt;ref name="Tulsa"/&gt;

In the fall of 2002, Trout began working with the [[United States Department of State]] in order to "train new diplomats in the art of projecting a positive image of America overseas" as a part of the ''Brand America'' campaign, which sought to improve public opinion about the upcoming [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Selling war: a review of the campaign; Darts at Hussein as an exercise in 'repositioning the competitor'?

Posener is a lawyer by educated who was active in the Swedish finance trade from the late 1980s to the end of the 1990s. He became publicly known in November 1997 after having been accused by the media as being the mastermind behind [[Lord Moyne]]s acquisition of the Swedish publicly traded company Trustor AB. The company acquisition, which later become known as the [[Trustor affair]] eventually ended with one of Lord Moynes "Team" members, [[Thomas Jisander]], being sent to a prison term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.di.se/artiklar/2009/10/26/fangelse-for-thomas-jisander-|title=Fängelse för Thomas Jisander|work=di.se|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Swedish police acted against Lord Moyne and his "team" in October 1997  Posener happened to be abroad, and he chose then according to his own statements to not return to Sweden. This became very well publicized in Swedish media and also led to  Posener being hand down an international arrest warrant. According to his own statements he was at first for some time in Spain, and later he is supposed to have lived in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/joachim-posener-bodde-i-latinamerika|title=Joachim Posener bodde i Latinamerika|work=svt.se|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the International Arrest Warrant  Posener was never found by the police and the crimes the police had suspected him of were no longer actionable against Mr Posener due to the Swedish law on statute of limitations. No one of Lord Moynes "team" could be accused in any court of law with regard to the Trustor Affair after the 20 June 2007.&lt;ref name="expressen.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/joachim-posener-jagas-inte-langre/|title=Joachim Posener jagas inte längre|work=Expressen|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joachim Posener has not been found guilty of any crime in connection with the Trustor Affair and the police have no longer any interest in him as of 2009.&lt;ref name="expressen.se"/&gt; With regard to any economic relationship between Posener and Trustor AB the two parties settled out of court in 2007, a settlement that among other things had  Posener pay 1.5 million SEK to Trustor AB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/posener-och-trustor-har-forlikats|title=Posener och Trustor har förlikats|work=svt.se|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two and a half years later, in December 2009, Swedish police and State prosecutor Bernt Berger met with Joachim Posener and Posener's Swedish attorney  Leif Gustafson, at Posener's own request at the Swedish embassy in [[Belgium]]. The meeting came to be because  Posener wished to be interrogated by police so the last criminal charges against him could be written off. The question was if Posener had the right to under the existing legal circumstances in which he found himself in 2004 published the book ''Internationellt Efterlyst – Mitt liv efter Trustor''.&lt;ref&gt;Internationellt Efterlyst – Mitt Liv Efter Trustor, Joachim Posener, 2004,{{ISBN|0-9549320-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; And also for appearing in a Swedish TV-interview with the show 45 Minuter hosted by [[Renée Nyberg]] and broadcast on [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] to talk about his case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TehrqbUUzxs|title=45 minuter: Joachim Posener talar ut. Del 1/6|date=24 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after  the meeting in [[Brussels]] Bernt Berger wrote off all remaining suspicions against Posener and therefore, since 2009, there exist no remaining suspicions of wrongdoing by Joachim Posener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/joachim-posener-en-fri-man|title=Joachim Posener en fri man|date=9 December 2009|work=DN.SE|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20070713/7877|title=Joachim Posener a free man|publisher=The Local|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of the current owners of English football clubs''', as well as (in some cases) their estimated net worth and source of wealth. All figures are listed in  rather than billions. example, £1,000m would be one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (1,000,000,000) pounds. Only shareholders with a significant interest (above 10%) are listed.
&lt;!-- PLEASE ONLY LIST SHAREHOLDERS WITH A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST (10%)--&gt;

'''Made in Britain''' is a [[not-for-profit organisation]] that supports British manufacturers under a single [[marque]]. The marque represents a standard of quality and unity for the British manufacturing sector within the UK and around the world.

The organisation works closely with the [[UK government]] and other groups to support skilled jobs and encourage creativity and [[sustainable growth]]. It campaigns all year round for British manufacturing.

== History ==
Made in Britain first began as the Made in Britain campaign in 2011. This campaign was established by [http://www.stoves.co.uk/ Stoves] – a [[Prescot]]-based cooker manufacturer.

Stoves commissioned independent market research using 1,000 adults&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2011/04/26/stoves-launches-campaign-made-britain-marque|title=Stoves launches campaign for 'Made in Britain' marque|work=The Drum|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discover the public’s opinion on British manufacturing – and whether it actually made a difference to people’s buying habits. From the study, 55% said that supporting UK manufacturing and jobs was their main incentive to buy British and 36% claimed to buy British whenever they can.

Following the research, Stoves launched a competition to design a logo for the newly established campaign. The winner was Cynthia Lee, a student designer from the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/july-2011-online/news-analysis-the-made-in-britain-logo/|title=News analysis: The Made in Britain logo - Design Week|date=2011-07-19|work=Design Week|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July 2011, the accreditation marque was unveiled and British businesses were invited to apply to use the logo for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2011/07/12/lsquomade-britainrsquo-marque-unveiled-following-national-campaign|title=‘Made in Britain’ marque unveiled following national campaign|work=The Drum|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving support from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kandbnews.co.uk/newsandviews/industrynews/stovesmadeinbritaincampaignnowindependent#.WcURAdOGOV4|title=Kitchen &amp; Bathroom News   {{!}} Stoves' Made in Britain Campaign now independent|last=www.overthrowdigital.com|first=Overthrow Digital -|website=www.kandbnews.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with over 600 members on board, a new Made in Britain marque was commissioned in May 2013. The new design was finalised in June 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-partners.com/made-in-britain/|title=Made in Britain|website=The Partners|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Made in Britain was officially launched as an independent, non-profit organisation in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2533876/Buying-British-Look-new-Made-Britain-logo.html|title=Buying British? Look for this new Made in Britain logo|work=This is Money|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Board of members ===

Following the successful launch of Made in Britain as a not-for-profit organisation, a board of members was established. This is made up of volunteer members of Made in Britain, and leadership from other groups that support British design, trade and industry.

The current board members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeingb.org/marque/the-marque|title=The Marque - Made in Britain|website=Made in Britain|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; are: 
* Chairman &amp; Non-executive Director, Chris Harrop of [[Marshalls plc]]
* Non-executive Director, Camilla Hadcock of [http://www.roachbridgetissues.com/ Roach Bridge Tissues]
* Non-executive Director, David Osborne of [https://www.roman-showers.com/ ROMAN Showers]
* Non-executive Director, Uri Baruchin of [http://www.the-partners.com/ The Partners]
* Non-executive Director, Antony Wallis of [https://bestofbritannia.com/ Best Of Britannia]
* Non-executive Director, Peter Atmore of [http://www.fracino.com Fracino]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.madeingb.org/news/-peter-atmore-joins-made-in-britain-boa|title=Commercial Coffee Machines {{!}} Cappuccino &amp; Espresso {{!}} Fracino|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fracino.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2015, the campaign employed John Pearce as a full-time Chief Executive Officer. John joined the Made in Britain Campaign from the GREAT Britain Campaign, the government's overseas business, tourism and education initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pearce-31222553/?ppe=1|title=John Pearce LinkedIn|last=|first=|date=|website=www.linkedin.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marque and branding ==

After it was commissioned by the board, the second iteration of the Made in Britain marque was created and designed by Kevin Lan and Miranda Bolter at The Partners. Inspired by a corner of the [[Union Jack]], the marque is designed to be instantly recognisable as the Made in Britain organisation.

When businesses join Made in Britain as a member they get access to the Made in Britain marque to use on their products, packaging and marketing material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Britain|first=Made in|title=Made in Britain Apply Here|date=2016-02-05|url=https://vimeo.com/154310113|accessdate=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flexible in size and scope, it’s used by a huge number of businesses in a number of industries. From large-scale industrial products and vehicles down to independently manufactured textiles, the marque is clear indicator of the diversity of British manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.dandad.org/awards/professional/2014/branding/23310/made-in-britain/ |title= Made in Britain {{!}} The Partners {{!}} Made in Britain {{!}} D&amp;AD Awards 2014 Pencil Winner {{!}} Branding Schemes/Small Business |website= www.dandad.org |language=en |access-date= 2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members often use the marque alongside their [[ISO9000]], BSI accreditations and the Queen’s Award for Export symbol.

== Types of manufacture ==
The biggest appeal of the Made in Britain organisation is that it celebrates the diverse nature of British manufacturing. To join the organisation and have use of the marque, businesses must become members of Made in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeingb.org/members/apply|title=Apply for Membership - Made in Britain|website=Made in Britain|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When members join, they fall into a set category type:

* Building &amp; Construction
* Clothing &amp; Apparel
* Energy
* Engineering
* Environment
* Food &amp; Beverage
* Health &amp; Beauty
* Home &amp; Living
* Printing &amp; Publishing
* Sports &amp; Leisure
* Technology
* Transport

To prove their eligibility, companies must be transparent in their claims and display supporting information about their manufacturing process and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeingb.org/marque/about|title=Made in Britain - Made in Britain|website=Made in Britain|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After joining, members are put into tiers depending on the financial turnover of the organisation – from T1 organisations (£1m per annum) to T4 organisations (&gt;£30m per annum). T4 organisations include [[Vauxhall]] that use the Made in Britain marque on its range of [[Renault Trafic|Vivaro]] vans. Rory Harvey, Vauxhall’s Chairman and Managing Director, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;“We are very proud of our 113-year heritage of building vehicles in Britain, and being part of this campaign is a great way to communicate this.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The Made in Britain campaign does a brilliant job of reminding customers that we have a highly-skilled workforce on our doorstep, producing thousands of high quality products.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;T3 and T2 organisations include Roman Showers and Fracino – you’ll find the Made in Britain marque featured on a large number of products.

Velopresso is an example of a T1 organisation that has used the Made in Britain marque as a way to communicate its commitment to British manufacture. &lt;blockquote&gt;“For us, the Made in Britain marque testifies not only to the provenance of Velopresso, but also to the strong relationships we’ve built with all those involved in its design and manufacture.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Future plans ==
Made in Britain is working to help [[Crown Commercial Service]] to identify UK manufacturers that are keen to sell to local authorities and the UK government – either for the first time or to increase their sales.

'''Marvin Pentz Gaye''' (born '''Gay Jr.''';&lt;!-- NOTE: Do not change the spelling of his birth name – it was Gay, with no e – he later changed it for his professional name. --&gt; April 2, 1939&amp;nbsp;– April 1, 1984){{sfn|Simmonds|2008|pp=190–192}} was an American singer, songwriter and record producer. Gaye helped to shape the sound of [[Motown]] in the 1960s, first as an in-house session player and later as a solo artist with a string of hits, including "[[Ain't That Peculiar]]", "[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)]]" and "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]", and duet recordings with [[Mary Wells]], [[Kim Weston]], [[Diana Ross]] and [[Tammi Terrell]], later earning the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|titles]] "Prince of Motown" and "Prince of Soul".

During the 1970s, he recorded the albums ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' and ''[[Let's Get It On]]'' and became one of  the first artists in Motown (joint with [[Stevie Wonder]]) to break away from the reins of a production company. His later recordings influenced several [[contemporary R&amp;B]] [[subgenre]]s, such as [[quiet storm]] and [[neo soul]].&lt;ref name=spin&gt;{{cite book |last=Weisbard |first=Eric |author2=Marks, Craig |title=Spin Alternative Record Guide (Ratings 1–10) |edition=1st edi. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50cEAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=spin%27s+alternative+record |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |date=October 10, 1995 |isbn=0-679-75574-8 |oclc=32508105|pages=202–205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a period in Europe as a [[tax exile]] in the early [[1980s in music|1980s]], he released the 1982 [[1983 Grammy Awards|Grammy Award-winning]] hit "[[Sexual Healing]]" and its parent album ''[[Midnight Love]]''.

==Early life==
[[File:Cardozo2014.jpg|thumb|right|Marvin Gaye attended Cardozo High School in Washington, D.C.'s Columbia Heights neighborhood.]]
Gaye was born Marvin Pentz Gay Jr. on April 2, 1939, at [[Howard University Hospital|Freedman's Hospital]]&lt;ref name=catlinwithlinks /&gt; in Washington, D.C., to church minister [[Marvin Gay Sr.]], and domestic worker [[Alberta Gay]] (née Cooper). His first home was in a public housing project,&lt;ref name=crockettsong&gt;{{cite news|last=Crockett|first=Stephen A., Jr.|title=Song of the City: In the Name of Marvin Gaye, Neighbors Rescue a Park Near His Old Home|work=The Washington Post|date=July 24, 2002|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fairfax Apartments&lt;ref name=milloysoul&gt;{{cite news|last=Milloy|first=Courtland|title=The War for One Man's Soul: Marvin Gaye|work=The Washington Post|date=April 8, 1984|page=C1, C2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now demolished) at 1617 1st Street SW in the [[Southwest Waterfront]] neighborhood.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|page=6}} Although one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, with many elegant [[Federal architecture|Federal-style]] homes, Southwest was primarily a vast slum. Most buildings were small, in extensive disrepair, and lacked both electricity and running water. The alleys were full of one- and two-story shacks, and nearly every dwelling was overcrowded.{{sfn|Banks|Banks|2004|page=41}}{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|pages=266–267}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bahrampour|first=Tara|title='Old but not cold': Four very longtime friends anticipate turning 100 this year|work=The Washington Post|date=March 14, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2017|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/old-but-not-cold-four-very-long-time-friends-anticipate-turning-100-this-year/2016/03/14/2c9f1b5e-e723-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaye and his friends nicknamed the area "Simple City", owing to its being "half-city, half country".{{sfn|Ritz|1991|page=13}}{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=4}}{{Efn|This area should not be confused with the present-day [[Benning Terrace]] public housing complex in the [[Benning Ridge]] neighborhood, which today is also nicknamed "Simple City".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gillis|first1=Justin|last2=Miller|first2=Bill|title=In D.C.'s Simple City, Complex Rules of Life and Death|work=The Washington Post|date=April 20, 1997|page=A1|accessdate=January 29, 2017|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/april/21/gangs.htm?ref=driverlayer.com/web}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gaye was the second oldest of the couple's four children. He had two sisters, Jeanne and Zeola, and one brother, [[Frankie Gaye]]. He also had two half-brothers: Michael Cooper, his mother's son from a previous relationship, and Antwaun Carey Gay,&lt;ref name=gayeplay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.detnews.com/entertainment/article?a=2013302160303&amp;f=1216 |title=Gaye's second wife calls play 'completely and utterly exploitative' |date=February 16, 2013 |accessdate=February 17, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=Jennica |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; born as a result of his father's [[extramarital affair]]s.&lt;ref name=gayeplay/&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
[[File:Marvin Gaye promotional photo.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1959 promotional picture of [[Harvey Fuqua|Harvey]] and the ''New Moonglows''. Gaye is second from the right behind a seated Fuqua.]]
Following his return, Gaye and his good friend Reese Palmer formed the vocal [[quartet]] [[The Marquees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncamarvy.com/Marquees/marquees.html |title=Marv Goldberg's R&amp;B Notebooks – MARQUEES |accessdate=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=38}} The group performed in the D.C. area and soon began working with [[Bo Diddley]], who assigned the group to [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] subsidiary [[OKeh Records]] after failing to get the group signed to his own label, [[Chess Records|Chess]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=38}} The group's sole single, "Wyatt Earp" (co-written by Bo Diddley), failed to chart and the group was soon dropped from the label.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=39}} Gaye began [[Musical composition|composing]] music during this period.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=39}}

[[The Moonglows|Moonglows]] co-founder [[Harvey Fuqua]] later hired The Marquees as employees.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=40}} Under Fuqua's direction, the group changed its name to Harvey and the New Moonglows, and relocated to Chicago.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=47}} The group recorded several sides for Chess in 1959, including the song "Mama Loocie", which was Gaye's first lead vocal recording. The group found work as [[session singers]] for established acts such as [[Chuck Berry]], singing on the hits "[[Back in the U.S.A.]]" and "[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]".

In 1960, the group disbanded. Gaye relocated to Detroit with Fuqua where he signed with Tri-Phi Records as a session musician, playing drums on several Tri-Phi releases. Gaye performed at [[Motown]] president [[Berry Gordy]]'s house during the holiday season in 1960. Impressed by the singer, Gordy sought Fuqua on his contract with Gaye. Fuqua agreed to sell part of his interest in his contract with Gaye.{{sfn|Edmonds|2001a|p=24}} Shortly afterwards, Gaye signed with Motown subsidiary Tamla.

When Gaye signed with Tamla, he pursued a career as a performer of [[jazz]] music and [[standard (song)|standards]], having no desire to become an [[R&amp;B]] performer.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=25}} Before the release of his first single, Gaye was teased about his surname, with some jokingly asking, "Is Marvin [[homosexuality|Gay]]?"{{sfn|Jet|1985b|p=17}} Gaye changed the spelling of his surname by adding an ''e'', in the same way as did [[Sam Cooke]]. Author [[David Ritz]] wrote that Gaye did this to silence rumors of his [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], and to put more distance between himself and his father.{{sfn|Jet|1985b|p=17}}

Gaye released his first single, "[[Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide]]", in May 1961, with the album ''[[The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye]]'', following a month later. Gaye's initial recordings failed commercially and he spent most of 1961 performing session work as a drummer for artists such as [[The Miracles]], [[The Marvelettes]] and blues artist [[Jimmy Reed]] for $5 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1961}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) a week.{{sfn|Bowman|2006|p=6}}{{sfn|Des Barres|1996|p=107}} While Gaye took some advice on performing with his eyes open (having been accused of appearing as though he were sleeping), he refused to attend grooming school courses at the John Roberts Powers School for Social Grace in Detroit because of his unwillingness to comply with its orders, something he later regretted.{{sfn|Posner|2002|p=116}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=88}}

===Initial success===
In 1962, Gaye found success as co-writer of the Marvelettes hit, "[[Beechwood 4-5789]]". His first solo hit, "[[Stubborn Kind of Fellow]]", was later released that September, reaching No. 8 on the R&amp;B chart and No. 46 on the Billboard Hot 100. Gaye reached the top 40 with the dance song, "[[Hitch Hike (song)|Hitch Hike]]",&lt;ref name=pc26&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19781/m1/ |title=Show 26 – The Soul Reformation: Phase two, the Motown story. [Part 5] }}&lt;/ref&gt; peaking at No. 30 on the Hot 100. "[[Pride and Joy (Marvin Gaye song)|Pride and Joy]]" became Gaye's first top ten single after its release in 1963.

The three singles and songs from the 1962 sessions were included on Gaye's second album, ''[[That Stubborn Kinda Fellow]]''. Starting in October of the year, Gaye performed as part of the [[Motortown Revue]], a series of concert tours headlined at the north and south eastern coasts of the United States as part of the [[chitlin' circuit]]. A filmed performance of Gaye at the [[Apollo Theater]] took place in June 1963. Later that October, Tamla issued the live album, ''[[Marvin Gaye Recorded Live on Stage]]''. "[[Can I Get a Witness]]" became one of Gaye's early international hits.

In 1964, Gaye recorded a successful duet album with singer [[Mary Wells]] titled ''[[Together (Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells album)|Together]]'', which reached No. 42 on the pop album chart. The album's two-sided single, including "[[Once Upon a Time (Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells song)|Once Upon a Time]]" and '[[What's the Matter With You Baby]]", each reach the top 20. Gaye's next solo hit, "[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)]]", which [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]] wrote for him, reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 and reached the top 50 in the UK. Gaye started getting television exposure around this time, on shows such as ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Also in 1964, he appeared in the [[concert film]], ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]''. Gaye had two number-one R&amp;B singles in 1965 with the [[The Miracles|Miracles]]–[[musical composition|composed]] "[[I'll Be Doggone]]" and "[[Ain't That Peculiar]]". Both songs became million-sellers. After this, Gaye returned to jazz-derived ballads for a tribute album to the recently-deceased [[Nat "King" Cole]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Marvin Gaye &amp; Tammi Terrell2.jpg|left|thumb|A screenshot of a 1967 performance by Gaye and Terrell during taping of the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]''.{{deletable image-caption|Friday, 13 October 2017|PROD}}]] --&gt;
After scoring a hit duet, "[[It Takes Two (Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston song)|It Takes Two]]" with [[Kim Weston]], Gaye began working with [[Tammi Terrell]] on a series of duets, mostly composed by [[Ashford &amp; Simpson]], including "[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]", "[[Your Precious Love]]", "[[Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing]]" and "[[You're All I Need to Get By]]".

{{Listen|filename=1968-marvin-gaye-grapevine.ogg|title="I Heard It through the Grapevine"|description="I Heard It through the Grapevine" was recorded by Gaye in April 1967, several months before [[Gladys Knight and the Pips]] recorded it. The song features a [[Wurlitzer electric piano|Wurlitzer]] piano, percussion, and horns. Gaye's recording of it paved the way for what later became "[[psychedelic soul]]".}}

In October 1967, Terrell collapsed in Gaye's arms during a performance in [[Farmville, Virginia]].{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=65}} Terrell was subsequently rushed to Farmville's Southside Community Hospital, where doctors discovered she had a malignant [[brain tumor|tumor in her brain]].{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=65}} The diagnosis ended Terrell's career as a [[live music|live performer]], though she continued to record music under careful supervision. Despite the presence of hit singles such as "Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing" and "You're All I Need to Get By", Terrell's illness caused problems with recording, and led to multiple operations to remove the tumor. Gaye was reportedly devastated by Terrell's sickness and became disillusioned with the record business.

On October 6, 1968, Gaye sang the national anthem during Game 4 of the [[1968 World Series]], held at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], between the [[Detroit Tigers]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].

In late 1968, Gaye's recording of ''[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]'' became Gaye's first to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached the top of the charts in other countries, selling over four million copies.{{sfn|Kempton|2005|p=207}} However, Gaye felt the success was something he "didn't deserve" and that he "felt like a puppet – Berry's puppet, [[Anna Gordy Gaye|Anna]]'s puppet...."{{sfn|Posner|2002|p=225}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=126}}{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=344}} Gaye followed it up with "[[Too Busy Thinking About My Baby]]" and "[[That's the Way Love Is (The Isley Brothers song)|That's the Way Love Is]]", which reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1969. That year, his album ''[[M.P.G.]]'' became his first No. 1 R&amp;B album. Gaye produced and co-wrote two hits for [[The Originals (band)|The Originals]] during this period, including "[[Baby I'm For Real]]" and "[[The Bells (The Originals song)|The Bells]]".

[[Tammi Terrell]] died from [[brain cancer]] on March 16, 1970; Gaye attended her funeral {{sfn|Jet|1970|p=60}} and after a period of depression, Gaye sought out a position on a [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] team, the [[Detroit Lions]], where he later befriended [[Mel Farr]] and [[Lem Barney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Plautz |url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/92596 |title=Marvin Gaye, Detroit Lions Wide Receiver? |publisher=Mental Floss |date=June 30, 2011 |accessdate=March 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510210102/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/92596 |archivedate=May 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually decided that Gaye would not be allowed to try out owing to fears of possible injuries that could have affected his music career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2009/07/29/music-legends-revealed-16/ Music Urban Legends Revealed #16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712214807/http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2009/07/29/music-legends-revealed-16/ |date=July 12, 2012 }}.

===''What's Going On'' and subsequent success===
{{Main|What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|Let's Get It On}}
On June 1, 1970, Gaye returned to [[Hitsville U.S.A.]], where he recorded his new composition "[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]", inspired by an idea from [[Renaldo "Obie" Benson]] of the [[Four Tops]] after he witnessed an act of [[police brutality]] at an [[anti-war]] rally in Berkeley.{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|pp=155}} Upon hearing the song, Berry Gordy refused its release due to his feelings of the song being "too political" for radio.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964–1981 |date=April 2006 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaye responded by going on strike from recording until the label released the song.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Released in 1971, it reached No. 1 on the R&amp;B charts within a month, staying there for five weeks. It also reached the top spot on [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'s pop chart for a week and reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 and the [[Record World]] chart, selling over two million copies.{{sfn|Vincent|1996|p=129}}{{sfn|Whitburn|2004|p=250}}

After giving an ultimatum to record a full album to win creative control from Motown, Gaye spent ten days recording the ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' album that March.{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=157}} Motown issued the album that May after Gaye remixed portions of the album in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The album became Gaye's first million-selling album launching two more top ten singles, "[[Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)]]" and "[[Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)|Inner City Blues]]". One of Motown's first autonomous works, its theme and segue flow brought the [[concept album]] format to rhythm and blues. An [[AllMusic]] writer later cited it as "...the most important and passionate record to come out of [[soul music]], delivered by one of its finest voices."&lt;ref name="review_1"&gt;John Bush. ''What's Going On'' remains one of the few examples in modern music of critical acclaim and immediate commercial success occurring simultaneously. ''What's Going On'' was the first in a series of Motown albums in which albums overtook singles in commercial importance as well as cultural significance.[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r8079/review|pure_url=yes}} review of ''What's Going On''], by Marvin Gaye, allmusic.com (accessed June 10, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; For the album, Gaye received two [[Grammy Awards of 1972|Grammy Award]] nominations and several [[NAACP Image Award]]s.{{sfn|Jet|1973|p=60}} The album also topped ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s year-end list as its album of the year. Billboard magazine named Gaye ''Trendsetter of the Year'' following the album's success.

In 1971, Gaye signed a new deal with Motown worth $1&amp;nbsp;million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1971}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), making it the most lucrative deal by a black recording artist at the time.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2009|p=156}} Gaye first responded to the new contract with the soundtrack and subsequent [[Sheet music|score]], ''[[Trouble Man (album)|Trouble Man]]'', released in late 1972. Around this period, he, Anna and Marvin III finally left Detroit and moved to Los Angeles permanently.

{{Listen|filename=Let's Get It On sample.ogg|title="Let's Get It On"|description="Let's Get It On" was written by Gaye and producer [[Ed Townsend]], originally as a [[gospel music|gospel]] song, and later as a protest song before eventually turning into a [[funk]]-oriented love anthem. It became Gaye's second number-one hit in 1973.}}

In 1973, Gaye released the ''[[Let's Get It On]]'' album. Its [[Let's Get It On (song)|title track]] became Gaye's second No. 1 single on the Hot 100. The album subsequently stayed on the charts for two years and sold over three million copies. The album was later hailed as "a record unparalleled in its sheer sensuality and carnal energy."&lt;ref name="review_2"&gt;Jason Ankeny, [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r8081|pure_url=yes}} review of ''Let's Get It On''], by Marvin Gaye, allmusic.com (accessed June 10, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Other singles from the album included "[[Come Get to This]]", which recalled Gaye's early Motown soul sound of the previous decade, while the suggestive "[[You Sure Love to Ball]]" reached modest success but received tepid promotion due to the song's sexually explicit content.{{sfn|Edmonds|2001b|pp=8–9}}

Marvin's final duet project, ''[[Diana &amp; Marvin]]'', with [[Diana Ross]], garnered international success despite contrasting artistic styles. Much of the material was crafted especially for the duo by Ashford and Simpson.&lt;ref&gt;"Ross, Diana/Marvin Gaye – Diana &amp; Marvin." ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. ''Oxford Music Online''. Oxford University Press. Web. January 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to demand from fans and Motown, Gaye started his first [[concert tour|tour]] in four years at the [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]] on January 4, 1974.{{sfn|Edmonds|2001b|p=14}} The performance received critical acclaim and resulted in the release of the live album, ''[[Marvin Gaye Live!]]'' and its single, a live version of ''[[Distant Lover]]'', an album track from ''Let's Get It On''.

The tour helped to enhance Gaye's reputation as a live performer.{{sfn|Edmonds|2001b|p=14}} For a time, he was earning $100,000 a night (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1974}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superseventies.com/1973_5singles.html |title=Let's Get It On – Marvin Gaye |work=SuperSeventies.com |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaye toured throughout 1974 and 1975. A renewed contract with Motown allowed Gaye to build his own [[Marvin's Room (recording studio)|custom-made recording studio]].

In October 1975, Gaye gave a performance at a [[UNESCO]] benefit concert at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]] to support UNESCO's African literacy drive, resulting in him being commended at the United Nations by then-Ambassador to [[Ghana]] [[Shirley Temple Black]] and [[Kurt Waldheim]].{{sfn|Jet|1975|p=19}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=208}} Gaye's next studio album, ''[[I Want You (Marvin Gaye album)|I Want You]]'', followed in 1976 with the title track [[I Want You (Marvin Gaye song)|"I Want You"]] becoming a No. 1 R&amp;B hit. That summer, Gaye embarked on his first European tour in a decade, starting off in England. In early 1977, Gaye released the live album, ''[[Live at the London Palladium]]'', which sold over two million copies thanks to the success of its studio song, "[[Got to Give It Up]]", which became a No. 1 hit.

===Last Motown recordings and European exile===
{{Main|Here, My Dear|In Our Lifetime (Marvin Gaye album)}}
In December 1978, Gaye released ''[[Here, My Dear]]'', inspired by the fallout of his first marriage to [[Anna Gordy Gaye|Anna Gordy]]. Recorded as an intent for Gaye to remit a portion of its royalties to her to receive [[alimony]] payments, it performed poorly on the charts.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/music/hidden/heredear.asp |title=Marvin Gaye Here, My Dear |work=snopes.com |date=September 16, 1994 |accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, Gaye developed a serious [[substance dependence|dependence and addiction]] to [[cocaine]] and was dealing with several financial issues with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. These issues led him to move to [[Maui, Hawaii]], where he struggled to record a [[disco]] album.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=265}} In 1980, Gaye went on a European tour.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=267}} By the time the tour stopped, the singer relocated to London when he feared [[imprisonment]] for failure to pay [[back taxes]], which had now reached upwards of $4.5&amp;nbsp;million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4500000|1980}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=267}}{{sfn|Gates|2004|p=333}}

Gaye then reworked ''Love Man'' from its original disco concept to another personal album invoking religion and the possible [[end time]] from a chapter in the [[Book of Revelation]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=266–267}} Titling the album ''[[In Our Lifetime (Marvin Gaye album)|In Our Lifetime?]]'', Gaye worked on the album for much of 1980 in London studios such as [[Air Studios|Air]] and [[Odyssey Studios]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=270–275}}

In the fall of that year, someone stole a master tape of a rough draft of the album from one of Gaye's traveling musicians, Frank Blair, taking the master tape to Motown's Hollywood headquarters.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=279}} Motown remixed the album and released it on January 15, 1981.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=280}} When Gaye learned of its release, he accused Motown of editing and remixing the album without his consent, allowing the release of an unfinished production (''Far Cry''), altering the album art of his request and removing the album title's question mark, muting its irony.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=280–281}} He also accused the label of rush-releasing the album, comparing his unfinished album to an unfinished [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] painting.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=280–281}} Gaye then vowed not to record any more music for Motown.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=281}}

On February 14, 1981, under the advice of music promoter [[Freddy Cousaert]], Gaye relocated to Cousaert's apartment in [[Ostend]], Belgium.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=282}} While there, Gaye shied away from heavy drug use and began exercising and attending a local Ostend church, regaining personal confidence.{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=320}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=283}} Following several months of recovery, Gaye sought a comeback onstage, starting the short-lived ''Heavy Love Affair'' tour in England and Ostend in June–July 1981.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=284}} Gaye's personal attorney Curtis Shaw would later describe Gaye's Ostend period as "the best thing that ever happened to Marvin". When word got around that Gaye was planning a musical comeback and an exit from Motown, [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Urban]] president Larkin Arnold eventually was able to convince Gaye to sign with CBS. On March 23, 1982, Motown and [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] negotiated Gaye's release from Motown. The details of the contract were not revealed due to a possible negative effect on the singer's settlement to creditors from the IRS.{{sfn|Jet|1982|p=59}}

{{Listen|filename=Sexual_Healing.ogg|title="Sexual Healing"|description="Sexual Healing" was written by Gaye alongside Odell Brown and [[David Ritz]]. Ritz said Gaye advised him to write a poem after telling the singer he needed "sexual healing" while living in Europe. The song became an international hit after its release in 1982.}}
Assigned to CBS's [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] subsidiary, Gaye worked on his first post-Motown album titled ''[[Midnight Love]]''. The first single, "[[Sexual Healing]]" which was written and recorded in Ostend in his apartment, was released on September 30, 1982, and became Gaye's biggest career hit, spending a record ten weeks at No. 1 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Black Singles]] chart, becoming the biggest R&amp;B hit of the 1980s according to ''Billboard'' stats. The success later translated to the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in January 1983 where it peaked at No. 3, while the record reached international success, reaching the top spot in [[RIANZ|New Zealand]] and [[RPM (magazine)|Canada]] and reaching the top ten on the United Kingdom's [[Official Charts Company|OCC singles chart]], later selling over two million copies in the U.S. alone, becoming Gaye's most successful single to date. The video for the song was shot at Ostend's Casino-Kursaal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ramada-ostend.com/ostendblog/ |title=What's on in Ostend |accessdate=November 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204093349/http://blog.ramada-ostend.com/ostendblog/ |archivedate=December 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sexual Healing'' won Gaye his first two [[Grammy Award]]s including [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance|Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance]], in February 1983, and also won Gaye an [[American Music Award]] in the [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]]-soul category. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine called it  "America's hottest musical turn-on since [[Olivia Newton-John]] demanded we get ''[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]].''" ''Midnight Love'' was released to stores a day after the single's release, and was equally successful, peaking at the top ten of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and becoming Gaye's eighth No. 1 album on the [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top Black Albums]] chart, eventually selling over six million copies worldwide, three million alone in the U.S.

On February 13, 1983, Gaye sang "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" at the [[1983 NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]] at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]] in [[Inglewood, California]]—accompanied by [[Gordon Banks (musician)|Gordon Banks]], who played the studio tape from the stands.{{sfn|Batchelor|2005|pp=41–43}} The following month, Gaye performed at the ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'' special. This and a May appearance on ''[[Soul Train]]'' (his third appearance on the show) became Gaye's final television performances. Gaye embarked on his final concert tour, titled the ''Sexual Healing Tour'', on April 18, 1983, in San Diego.{{sfn|Ebony|1985|p=102}} The tour ended on August 14, 1983 at the [[Pacific Amphitheatre]] in [[Costa Mesa, California]] but was plagued by cocaine-triggered [[paranoia]] and illness. Following the concert's end, he moved into his parents' house in Los Angeles. In early 1984, ''Midnight Love'' was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance category, his 12th and final nomination.

==Death==
{{main|Death of Marvin Gaye}}
At 12:38&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]) on April 1, 1984, while Gaye was in his bedroom, his father, [[Marvin Gay Sr.]], shot Gaye in the heart and then in his left shoulder, the latter shot taken at [[point-blank range]].&lt;ref name="finaldeath"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/g/Marvin%20Gaye/marvin_gaye.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031011031506/http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/g/Marvin%20Gaye/marvin_gaye.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 11, 2003 |title=The Death of Marvin Gaye |accessdate=April 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}} Minutes earlier, the two men had been involved in a physical altercation when Gaye intervened in a fight between his parents. The first shot proved to be fatal. Gaye was pronounced dead at 1:01&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]) after his body arrived at [[California Hospital Medical Center]], one day short of his 45th birthday.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=334}} {{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}}

After Gaye's funeral, his body was cremated at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] at the [[Hollywood Hills]]; his ashes were later scattered into the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp = 335–336}} Initially charged with first-degree murder, Gay Sr.'s charges dropped to [[voluntary manslaughter]] following a diagnosis of a brain tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/21/us/around-the-nation-no-contest-plea-in-death-of-marvin-gaye.html?scp=1&amp;sq=death%20of%20marvin%20gaye&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=AROUND THE NATION; No-Contest Plea in Death of Marvin Gaye | date=September 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvin Gay Sr. was later sentenced to a suspended six-year sentence and probation.

==Personal life==
{{main|Personal life of Marvin Gaye}}
Gaye married [[Berry Gordy]]'s sister, [[Anna Gordy]], in June 1963. The couple separated in 1973, and Anna filed for divorce in November 1975. The couple was officially divorced in 1977. Gaye later married Janis Hunter in October 1977. The couple separated in 1979, and were officially divorced in February 1981.

Gaye was the father of three children, Marvin III (adopted with Anna; Marvin III was the son of [[Denise Gordy]], Anna's niece), and [[Nona Gaye|Nona]] and Frankie, whom he had with his second wife, Janis. At the time of his death, he was survived by his three children, parents, and five siblings.

==Musicianship==

===Influences===
As a child, Gaye's main influence was his minister father, something he later acknowledged to biographer [[David Ritz]], and also in interviews, often mentioning that his father's sermons greatly impressed him. His first major musical influences were [[doo-wop]] groups such as [[The Moonglows]] and [[The Capris (Philadelphia group)|The Capris]]. Gaye's [[Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame]] page lists the Capris' song, "[[God Only Knows (1954 song)|God Only Knows]]" as "critical to his musical awakening."&lt;ref name="Marvin Gaye Biography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/marvin-gaye/bio/ |title=Marvin Gaye Biography |work=The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame &amp; Museum |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Capris' song, Gaye said, "It fell from the heavens and hit me between the eyes. So much soul, so much hurt. I related to the story, to the way that no one except the Lord really can read the heart of lonely kids in love."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=27}} Gaye's main musical influences were Rudy West of [[The Five Keys]], [[Clyde McPhatter]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Little Willie John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964–1981 |date=April 2006 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=29}} Gaye considered [[Frank Sinatra]] a major influence in what he wanted to be.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=29}} He also was influenced by the vocal styles of [[Billy Eckstine]] and [[Nat King Cole]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=30}}

Later on as his Motown career developed, Gaye would seek inspiration in fellow label mates such as [[David Ruffin]] of [[The Temptations]] and [[Levi Stubbs]] of the [[Four Tops]] as their grittier voices led to Gaye and his producer seeking a similar sound in recordings such as "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]" and "[[That's the Way Love Is (The Isley Brothers song)|That's the Way Love Is]]". Later in his life, Gaye reflected on the influence of Ruffin and Stubbs stating, "I had heard something in their voices something my own voice lacked".&lt;ref name="Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964–1981 |date=April 2006 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=100}} He further explained, "the [[The Temptations|Tempts]] and [[Four Tops|Tops]]' music made me remember that when a lot of women listen to music, they want to feel the power of a real man."&lt;ref name="Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing"/&gt;{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=100}}

===Vocal style===
Gaye had a four-octave [[vocal range]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=82}} From his earlier recordings as member of the Marquees and Harvey and the New Moonglows, and in his first several recordings with Motown, Gaye recorded mainly in the [[baritone]] and [[tenor]] ranges. He changed his tone to a rasp for his gospel-inspired early hits such as "Stubborn Kind of Fellow" and "Hitch Hike". As writer [[Eddie Holland]] explained, "He was the only singer I have ever heard known to take a song of that nature, that was so far removed from his natural voice where he liked singing, and do whatever it took to sell that song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964–1981 |date=April 2006 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In songs such as "Pride and Joy", Gaye used three different vocal ranges—singing in his baritone range at the beginning, bringing a lighter tenor in the verses before reaching a gospel mode in the chorus. Holland further stated of Gaye's voice that it was "...one of the sweetest and prettiest voices you ever wanted to hear."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964–1981 |date=April 2006 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while he noted that ballads and jazz was "his basic soul", he stated Gaye "...had the ability to take a roughhouse, rock and roll, blues, R&amp;B, any kind of song and make it his own", later saying that Gaye was the most versatile vocalist he had ever worked with.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Gaye changed his vocal style in the late 1960s, when he was advised to use a sharper, raspy voice—especially in Norman Whitfield's recordings. Gaye initially disliked the new style, considering it out of his range, but said he was "into being produce-able."&lt;ref name="Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing"/&gt; After listening to David Ruffin and Levi Stubbs, Gaye said he started to develop what he called his "tough man voice"—saying, "I developed a growl."&lt;ref name="Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing"/&gt;{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=100}} In the liner notes of his DVD set, ''Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964–1981'', Rob Bowman said that by the early 1970s, Gaye had developed "three distinct voices: his smooth, sweet tenor; a growling rasp; and an unreal [[falsetto]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964–1981 |date=April 2006 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowman further wrote that the recording of the ''What's Going On'' single was "...the first single to utilize all three as Marvin developed a radical approach to constructing his recordings by layering a series of contrapuntal background vocal lines on different tracks, each one conceived and sung in isolation by Marvin himself."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Bowman cites Gaye's multi-tracking of his tenor voice and other vocal styles "summon[ed] up what might be termed the ancient art of weaving".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Social commentary and concept albums===
Prior to recording the ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' album, Gaye recorded a cover of the song, "[[Abraham, Martin &amp; John]]", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary, including [[Curtis Mayfield]]. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by [[The Temptations]] in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social events such as the 1965 [[Watts riots]] and once asked himself, "with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=156}} When the singer called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do [[protest music]], Gordy cautioned him, "Marvin, don't be ridiculous. That's taking things too far."{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=157}}

Gaye was inspired by the [[Black Panther Party]] and supported the efforts they put forth like giving free meals to poor families door to door. However, he did not support the violent tactics the Panthers used to fight oppression, as Gaye's messages in many of his political songs were [[nonviolent]]. The lyrics and music of ''What's Going On'' discuss and illustrate issues during the 1960s/1970s such as police brutality, drug abuse, environmental issues, anti-war, and black power issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Party Music : The Inside Story of the Black Panthers' Band and How Black Power Transformed Soul Music|last = Vincet|first = Rickey|publisher = Lawrence Hill Books|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 288–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaye was inspired to make this album because of events such as the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 race riots in Detroit]], and the [[Kent State shootings]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |title=Things Aint Like What They Used to Be: Marvin Gaye and The Making of What's Going On |last=Charnock |first=Ruth |date=2015 |journal=United Academics Journal of Social Sciences |doi= |pmid= |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120111436/http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Gaye presented Gordy with the ''What's Going On'' album, Gordy feared Gaye was risking the ruination of his image as a sex symbol.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Following the album's success, Gaye tried a follow-up album that he would label ''You're the Man''. The [[You're the Man|title track]] only produced modest success, however, and Gaye and Motown shelved the album. Later on, several of Gaye's unreleased songs of social commentary, including "[[The World Is Rated X]]", would be issued on posthumous compilation albums. ''What's Going On'' would later be described by an [[AllMusic]] writer as an album that "not only redefined soul music as a creative force but also expanded its impact as an agent for social change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4344/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic (((Marvin Gaye – Overview)))|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album also provided another first in both Motown and R&amp;B music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album in a [[song cycle]], segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R&amp;B albums that traditionally included [[filler (music)|filler tracks]] to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Barry White]] making the concept album format a part of 1970s R&amp;B music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. ''Let's Get It On'' repeated the suite-form arrangement of ''What's Going On'', as would Gaye's later albums such as ''I Want You'', ''Here, My Dear'' and ''In Our Lifetime''.

Although Marvin Gaye was not actually doing social justice work outside of his music, he became a public figure for social change and inspired/educated many people through his work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Marvin Gaye has been called "The number-one [[purveyance|purveyor]] of soul music".{{sfn|Browne|2001|p=316}} In his book ''Mercy Mercy Me: The Art, Loves and Demons of Marvin Gaye'', [[Michael Eric Dyson]] described Gaye as someone "...who transcended the boundaries of [[rhythm and blues]] as no other performer had done before."{{sfn|Dyson|2004|p=3}} Following his death, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Gaye as someone who "blended the soul music of the urban scene with the beat of the old-time gospel singer and became an influential force in pop music".&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |title=Marvin Gaye Is Shot And Killed; Pop Singer's Father Faces Charge |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 1, 1984 |access-date=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further in the article, Gaye was also credited with combining "the soulful directness of gospel music, the sweetness of soft-soul and pop, and the vocal musicianship of a jazz singer."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; His recordings for Motown in the 1960s and 1970s shaped that label's [[Motown#Motown Sound|signature sound]]. His work with Motown gave him the titles ''Prince of Soul'' and ''Prince of Motown.''{{sfn|Edmonds|2001a|p=12}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=ix}}  Critics stated that Gaye's music "...signified the development of black music from raw rhythm and blues, through sophisticated soul to the political awareness of the 1970s and increased concentration on personal and sexual politics thereafter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classicbands.com/gaye.html |title=Marvin Gaye |work=Classic Bands |access-date=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Motown artist, Gaye was among the first to break from the reins of its production system, paving the way for [[Stevie Wonder]].{{sfn|Browne|2001|p=316}}{{sfn|Edmonds|2001a|p=10}}{{sfn|Gilmore|1998|p=220}}&lt;ref name="superseventies"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superseventies.com/spgayemarvin2.html |title=Marvin Gaye – What's Going On |work=SuperSeventies.com |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaye's late 1970s and early 1980s recordings influenced contemporary forms of R&amp;B predating the subgenres [[quiet storm]] and [[neo-soul]].&lt;ref name=spin/&gt;

Artists from many genres have covered Gaye's music, including [[James Taylor]], [[Brian McKnight]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Chico DeBarge]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[A Perfect Circle]], [[The Strokes]] and [[Gil Scott-Heron]]. Other artists such as [[D'Angelo]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Nas]], Erick Sermon, and [[Maxwell (singer)|Maxwell]] interpolated parts of Gaye's clothing from the singer's mid-1970s period. Gaye's clothing style was later appropriated by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his role as James "Thunder" Early in ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''. According to David Ritz, "Since 1983, Marvin's name has been mentioned—in reverential tones—on no less than seven top-ten hit records."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=ix}} Later performers such as [[Kanye West]] and [[Mary J. Blige]] sampled Gaye's work for their recordings.

===Awards and honors===
The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inducted him in 1987, declaring that Gaye "...made a huge contribution to soul music in general and the Motown Sound in particular." The page stated that Gaye "...possessed a classic [[R&amp;B]] voice that was edged with grit yet tempered with sweetness." The page further states that Gaye "...projected an air of soulful authority driven by fervid conviction and heartbroken vulnerability."&lt;ref name="Marvin Gaye Biography"/&gt; A year after his death, then-mayor of D.C., [[Marion Barry]] declared April 2 as "Marvin Gaye Jr. Memorial Scholarship Fund Day" in the city.{{sfn|Jet|1985a|p=56}} Since then, a non-profit organization has helped to organize annual Marvin Gaye Day Celebrations in the city of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvingayeday.com|title=Home Page|access-date=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
His [[1983 NBA All-Star Game|1983 NBA All-Star performance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=985241 |title=Marvin Gaye's 'National Anthem' |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=February 7, 2003 |access-date=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the national anthem was used in a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] commercial featuring the 2008 U.S. Olympic basketball team. Also, on [[NBA on CBS|CBS Sports]]' final NBA telecast to date (before the contract moved to [[NBA on NBC|NBC]]) at the conclusion of Game 5 of the [[1990 NBA Finals|1990 Finals]], they used Gaye's 1983 All-Star Game performance over the closing credits. When [[VH1]] launched on January 1, 1985, Gaye's 1983 rendition of the national anthem was the very first video they aired. In 2010, it was used in the intro to [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[The Tenth Inning|Tenth Inning]]'' documentary on the game of baseball.

"I Heard It Through the Grapevine" was played in a [[Levi's]] ad in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XDUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Fashion Marketing|author1=Janet Bohdanowicz |author2=Liz Clamp |page=73|publisher=Routledge|year= 1994 |isbn=978-0-41505-939-8 |accessdate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Modules/MC30820/launderette.html |title=The Sunday Times 100 Greatest TV Ads |pages=119–121 |author=Mark Robinson |publisher=HarperCollins |date=March 1, 2001 |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706032759/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Modules/MC30820/launderette.html |archivedate=July 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the commercial's success led to the original song finding renewed success in Europe after [[Motown Records|Tamla-Motown]] re-released it in the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt; In 1986, the song was covered by [[Buddy Miles]] as part of a [[California Raisins]] ad campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VxMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Buddy Miles, 60|magazine=Billboard |page=60|author=Kristina Tunzi|date=March 15, 2008 |accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was later used for [[chewing gum]] commercials in Finland and to promote a brand of [[Lucky Strike]] cigarettes in Germany.{{sfn|Billboard|1994|p=70}}{{sfn|Billboard|1994|p=80}}

Gaye's music has also been used in numerous [[film soundtracks]] including ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]'' and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', both of which featured Gaye's music from his ''Trouble Man'' soundtrack.

In 2007, his song "A Funky Space Reincarnation" was used in the [[Charlize Theron]]–starred ad for [[Dior]] J'Adore perfume. A documentary about Gaye—''What's Going On: The Marvin Gaye Story''—was a UK/[[PBS]] co-production, directed by [[Jeremy Marre]] and was first broadcast in 2006. Two years later, the special re-aired with a different production and newer interviews after it was re-broadcast as an ''[[American Masters]]'' special. Another documentary, focusing on his 1981 documentary, ''Transit Ostend'', titled ''Remember Marvin'', aired in 2006.

On March 11, 2015, Gaye's family was awarded $7.4&amp;nbsp;million in damages following a decision by an eight-member jury in Los Angeles that [[Robin Thicke]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] had breached copyright by incorporating part of Gaye's song "Got to Give It Up"  into their hit "[[Blurred Lines]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-31825059|publisher=BBC News|title=Blurred Lines jury awards Marvin Gaye family $7m|date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, the Gaye family requested a California judge give $2.66 million in attorneys' fees and $777,000 in legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/hollywood-docket-marvin-gaye-family-854928 |title=My Favorite Things, Part II |last=Garnder |first=Eriq |date=2016-01-12 |access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted biopics===
There have been several attempts to adapt Gaye's life story into a feature film.  In February 2006, it was reported that [[Jesse L. Martin]] was to portray Gaye in a biopic titled ''Sexual Healing'', named after Gaye's [[Sexual Healing|1982 song of the same name]].  The film was to have been directed by Lauren Goodman and produced by [[James Gandolfini]] and Alexandra Ryan.

'''Matthew Paul Somers''' (born 1967) is a management consultant specialising in providing coaching skills for managers. He grew up in London, attending [[Acton High School|Faraday High School]] and began his working life with [[Barclays Bank]] in their Notting Hill branch. His career with Barclays took him to Poole in Dorset but he now lives in North East England with his wife and daughter.

== Career ==

Leaving school at 16, Matt joined [[Barclays]] on a standard-entry school leaver programme in 1983. He credits his fascination with the management of people to those early work experiences – not all of which were very positive.

After seven years or so of branch-banking Matt took up a role in personnel juggling a variety of recruitment and training responsibilities.

It was whilst working as a training manager that Matt attended a coaching skills programme run by [[Sir John Whitmore]] and Performance Consultants. Matt has said that attending this training transformed his working life and that he wishes he could have been managed this way in his early days with the bank.

After leaving Barclays Matt set up his first training consultancy in 1999. Called Performance Development, the firm provided training in a number of soft skills areas with courses being delivered by Matt or one of the firm's associate trainers.

However, in 2000 Matt focused the firm on coaching skills for managers. At the same time Matt undertook a master's degree in Human Resource Development with the [[University of Sunderland]] where he researched coaching in a contact centre environment for his dissertation.

In 2002, Matt's first book, ''Coaching in a Week''&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Successful-Coaching-Week-Matt-Somers/dp/0340804920 Coaching in a Week], (Hodder, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; was published by [[Hodder and Stoughton]].

==Marquette Electronics==
Along with [[Warren Cozzens]], he founded [[Marquette Electronics]] in 1965 and served as chairman and CEO. The company went public in 1991.  After starting  with only $15,000 in capital, the company went on to have over $350 million annually in sales.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}  

His company put together the nation's first central electrocardiographic system at [[Northwestern University]] Medical School.  This machine has since become standard in hospitals throughout the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}  The company was also noted for having one of the first on-site day care centers in the nation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}  

In 1982, he and Warren bought the failing Patient Monitoring Business Unit from [[GE]] (then known as General Electric Medical Systems Division) and combined it with the existing business (primarily diagnostic equipment).{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In 1998, he sold Marquette Electronics (by then known as Marquette Medical Systems) to GE.  The company exists today as part of the Clinical Systems division of [[GE Healthcare]], a subsidiary of the American conglomerate.  After stepping aside at his company, Cudahy focused his energies on philanthropy and serving on the boards of other companies.  

In 1999, according to [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) filings, he invested $10 million in TomoTherapy a [[Madison, Wisconsin]] bio-technology start-up.  It went public on May 9, 2007 with the stock symbol TOMO. Mr Cudahy's 10% interest is valued at more than $100 million at present prices (September 2007).{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In 2002 he told the story of the founding of Marquette Electronics in the book ''Joyworks'' ({{ISBN|0-938076-17-5}}).

'''Rapid Heat Cycle Molding (RHCM)''' is also known as steam [[injection molding]]. Dr. Chao-Tsai Huang has written an extensive 68 page paper outlining, among other things, a case study on RHCM.  His paper is entitled [http://www.aida-sl.com/PDF/RHCM.pdf In-depth Study of RHCM and IHM Technologiesand Industrial Applications]&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering Volume 24 Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seokkwan Hong et al 2014 J. Micromech. Microeng. 24 015009 doi:10.1088/0960-1317/24/1/015009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Chao- Tsai Huang&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, ABS material is used as the raw material. The primary advantage of steam injection is that it eliminates weld-lines on molded parts. This allows [[company|companies]] to eliminate future processes such as [[painting]]. In non-steam molding, [[water]] will heat the tool to a constant temperature. Plastic will be injected to the warm tool.

In steam molding, [[steam]] is injected at 160 degrees to heat the tool. When the tool reaches a predetermined temperature (about 140 degrees), the [[plastic]] is injected. Cold water is immediately added to the process to cool the plastic down to around 40 degrees.
Because the mold is so hot when the plastic is injected, there are no weld lines, and a "perfect" product results. Steam injection molding is now being extensively used to produce the front covers of [[LCD TV]]s.

'''Scoring''' is a process in which one cuts a groove into rigid material (usually [[tile]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[glass]], etc.).  This groove is used to either break the material along the slit, for decoration, or act as a guideline for other processes such as painting. It can also be used to allow materials to expand and contract under varying thermal conditions. Scoring is used in place of cutting through the material all the way because you can obtain relatively the same results with less time and labor.

==Disadvantages of scoring==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:scoring.JPG|thumb|200px|right|1. Groove &lt;br /&gt;2. Jagged edge from breakage{{deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 9 February 2009}}]] --&gt;
* When breaking along the score line the material may deviate from the set guideline. 
* The back side of the break line has a jagged edge to it from the shear fracture.  
* Scoring offers very little use to metallic materials.

==Decorations==
Scoring is most commonly used in concrete work for decoration by making the grooves appear to be grout lines from tile work.

'''''State v. Elliott''''', 616 A.2d 210 (Vt. 1992), is a decision of the [[Vermont Supreme Court]] holding that all [[aboriginal title]] in [[Vermont]] was extinguished "by the increasing weight of history."&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Elliott'', 616 A.2d 210, 218 (Vt. 1992) ("The legal standard does not require that extinguishment spring full blown from a single telling event. Extinguishment may be established by the increasing weight of history.").&lt;/ref&gt;  The Vermont Supreme Court has clarified that its holding in ''Elliott'' applies to the entire state.&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Cameron'', 658 A.2d 939, 940 (Vt. 1995) ("Our holding in that case was made as a matter of law based on historical fact. Consequently, under the doctrine of [[stare decisis]], ''Elliott'' is precedent binding in general, not just binding on parties to the original case. . . . ''Elliott'' affects all lands within Vermont's boundaries.").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Abenaki people}}
In 1987, the land claim became an issue in the Abenaki chief election between [[Homer St. Francis]] and [[Lester Lampman]].  Lampman advocated that the tribe take a more aggressive stance in pushing its claim to "all of Vermont as well as parts of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine."&lt;ref&gt;UPI, Indians fight for control of tribe, September 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  St. Francis won the election.

On October 18, 1987, St. Francis organized a "fish-in" with 35 other tribal members on the [[Missisquoi River]], conducted without licenses from the state.&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt;

Just prior to the district court's decision, Chief St. Francis withdrew the tribe's petition for [[federally recognized tribe|federal recognition]], saying:  "We don't need a Government we don't recognize to tell us we exist."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Prior history==
The case arose in the aftermath two Vermont District Court decisions.

===''State v. Saint Francis'' (1989)===
In ''State v. Saint Francis'', on August 14, 1989, Judge [[Joseph J. Wolchik]] of the Vermont District Court in Franklin County, in a 96-page decision,&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Saint Francis'', No. 1171-10-86Fcr (Vt. Dist. Ct. Aug. 11, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  held that the Abenaki were a tribe, retained aboriginal rights to hunt and fish, and therefore did not need to acquire fishing licenses from the state.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;''New York Times'', Indians in Vermont Tribe Need No Licenses to Fish, Judge Rules, August 15, 1989, at A19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge Wolchik held that the Abenaki's aboriginal area consisted of 500,000 acres in northwestern Vermont:  [[Grand Isle County]], most of [[Franklin County, Vermont|Franklin County]], and some of [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden]] and [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans]] counties.&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt;  Wolchik dismissed the charges against all but six of the defendants; he held that the remaining six were not tribal members.&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the decision, Chief St. Francis vowed to file a land claim "as soon as possible."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  By then, St. Francis estimated the tribe's claim area as  "all of Vermont, all of New Hampshire, and parts of northern Massachusetts, western Maine, upstate New York and southern Quebec."&lt;ref name="bg"&gt;''Boston Globe'', Tribe to claim one-third of New England, August 10, 1990, at M1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Union Leader'' (Manchester, NH), Abenakis Say They Own NH, Vt., Plan To File Suit To Regain Land, August 11, 1990, at 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 12, 1990, several [[title insurance]] companies in Vermont attempted to amend their standard policy contracts (an action that requires approval from the state banking department) to exclude a potential Abenaki claim from coverage.&lt;ref&gt;''Union Leader'' (Manchester, NH), Native Claims Cloud Vt. Title Insurance, September 12, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''State v. Bellevue'' (1990)===
In ''State v. Bellevue'', on August 13, 1990, in another fishing rights case, Judge [[Edward Cashman]] of the Vermont District Court in Franklin County held that the Abenaki were not exempt from state criminal jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="bellevue"&gt;''State v. Bellevue'', No. 1862-11-89Fcr (Vt. Dist. Ct. Aug. 13, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge Cashman, unlike Judge Wolchik, held neither tribal status nor aboriginal fishing rights could exist in the absence of a federal treaty.&lt;ref name="bellevue"/&gt;

==Opinion==
The Vermont Supreme Court reversed and remanded Judge Wolchik's decision.

The opinion's main legal innovation was holding that "[a]n historical event, although insufficient by itself to establish an extinguishment, may contribute to a finding of extinguishment when analyzed together with other events" and that "a century-long course of conduct may demonstrate extinguishment, even though the exact date on which Indian title is extinguished is difficult to determine."&lt;ref&gt;616 A.2d at 213-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court concluded that "a series of historical events, beginning with the Wentworth Grants of 1763, and ending with Vermont's admission to the Union in 1791, extinguished the aboriginal rights claimed here."&lt;ref&gt;616 A.2d at 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Legal commentary on the ''Elliott'' decision has been generally negative.  According to Joseph William Singer, a professor at [[Harvard Law School]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t defies both precedent and the longstanding policy of protecting Indian title to conclude that Congress, by the simple admission of Vermont to the Union, casually obliterated all Abenaki title in the State of Vermont, whether currently settled by non-Indians or inhabited by Abenakis.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 28 Ga. L. Rev. at 519.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gene Bergman wrote in the ''American Indian Law Review'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Elliot'' misinterprets Abenaki/Vermont history during the period from 1763 to 1791.  An honest account of history would not have found extinguishment under the traditional rules.  Hence, to avoid this conclusion, the Vermont Court created a radical new test that undermines the United States Supreme Court's rules and purposes protecting aboriginal title. . . .&lt;br&gt;Essentially, the court changed the test from an examination of intent/purpose to a review of cumulative effects.  Under this new test, a sovereign need not have known that the consequences of an act would eliminate aboriginal title.  Therefore, if the sovereign unleashed forces which eventually frustrated Indian occupancy, ''Elliot'' would find extinguishment in that act.  ''Elliot'' implicitly holds that the cumulative effects need not be manifested at the time of or near in time to the sovereign action.  The functional result of ''Elliot'' is that courts will weigh the cumulative effects of a sovereign's action over a long time—say, 200 years.  This removes the barrier prohibiting the light imputing of extinguishment.  ''Elliot'' undermines the entire framework of aboriginal title law.&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, 18 Am. Indian. L. Rev. at 458-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to John Lowndes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This controversial decision marks a clear departure from the longstanding aboriginal title [[aboriginal title in the Marshall Court|doctrine expounded]] in the early nineteenth century by Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] and the United States Supreme Court.  The Vermont court's decision not only breaks with the rule that a tribe must consent to extinguishment of its aboriginal title, but also rejects the requirement that the dominant sovereign must express its intent to extinguish title with a "plain and unambiguous action."  The Vermont Supreme Court's holding that the "increasing weight of history" alone can terminate Indian title disposes of the rule of law, and replaces it with a selective reading of the conqueror's history.&lt;ref&gt;Lowndes, 42 Buff. L. Rev. at 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
===State recognition===
Vermont extended state-recognition to the Abenaki in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;2006 Vt. Legis. Serv. 125 (West) (codified as amended at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, §§ 851-853).&lt;/ref&gt;  The original recognition act provided:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This chapter shall not be construed to recognize, create, extend, or form the basis of any right or claim to land or real estate in Vermont for the Abenaki people or any Abenaki individual and shall be construed to confer only those rights specifically described in this chapter.&lt;ref&gt;2006 Vt. Legis. Serv. 125 (West) (codified at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, § 853(c) (amended 2010)).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The language was amended and re-codified in 2010:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recognition of a Native American Indian tribe shall not be construed to create, extend, or form the basis of any right or claim to land or real estate in Vermont or right to conduct any gambling activities prohibited by law, but confers only those rights specifically described in this chapter.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Vt. Legis. Serv. 107 (West) (codified at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, § 853(h)).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The amendment bill also added the following language:

&lt;blockquote&gt;State-recognized Native American Indian tribes and their members will continue to be subject to all laws of the state, and recognition shall not be construed to create any basis or authority for tribes to establish or promote any form of prohibited gambling activity or to claim any interest in land or real estate in Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Vt. Legis. Serv. 107 (West) (codified at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, § 851(8)).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Federal recognition===
The St. Francis / Sokoki Band of Abenakis of Vermont were denied federal recognition on July 2, 2007.&lt;ref name="fed"&gt;Final Determination against Federal Acknowledgment of the St. Francis / Sokoki Band of Abenakis of Vermont, 72 Fed. Reg. 36,022 (July 2, 2007); see also Proposed Finding Against Federal Acknowledgment of the St. Francis/Sokoki Band of Abenakis of Vermont, 70 Fed. Reg. 69,776 (proposed Nov. 17, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Interior determined that the Abenaki failed to satisfy four of the seven criteria for federal recognition:  
#that external observers identify the group as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since 1900,
#that a predominant portion of the group comprises a distinct community and has existed as a community from historical times until the present,
#that the group has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity from historical times until the present, and
#that the group's membership consist of individuals who descend from a historical Indian tribe or from historical Indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity.&lt;ref name="fed"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2856">In [[shipping]], the '''stowage factor''' indicates how many [[cubic metre]]s of space one metric [[tonne]] (or cubic feet of space one long ton) of a particular type of [[cargo]] occupies in a [[Hold (ship)|hold]] of a [[cargo ship]].&lt;ref name="maritimeeconomics"&gt;Stopford, M. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tfsC6RUDn2QC Maritime Economics]. Third Edition. Roudledge, 2009. Pages 575–576.&lt;/ref&gt; It is calculated as the ratio of the [[stowage]] space required under normal conditions, including the stowage losses caused by the means of transportation and packaging, to the weight of the cargo.&lt;ref name="tis-gdv"&gt;[http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/misc/staumass.htm Stowage factor]. Transport Information Service (TIS). {{Retrieved | accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stowage factor can be used in [[ship design]] and as a reference to evaluate the efficiency of use of the [[cargo space]] on a ship.

== Variability ==
The stowage factor varies from one type of [[commodity]] to another — for example [[iron ore]] has a stowage factor of 0.40 (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mt), meaning that the space needed by one tonne of ore is only one sixth of that required to stow one tonne of [[woodchips]] that have a stowage factor of 2.5. This means that if a ship designed to carry woodchips is loaded with iron ore, only a small part of the hold capacity can be utilized, and a [[bulk carrier]] designed to carry iron ore cannot be loaded to the maximum [[Draft (hull)|draft]] with woodchips, leaving much of its [[deadweight tonnage]] unutilized. Thus the stowage factor is taken into account in ship design when determining the size of cargo holds, and specialized ships such as [[ore carrier]]s and [[car carrier]]s are built for cargoes with a stowage factor that departs significantly from the average.&lt;ref name="maritimeeconomics" /&gt;

The stowage factor also depends on the type of [[packaging]], being the lowest for unpackaged [[bulk cargo]]. While most commonly used for dry bulk cargo, a stowage factor can also be calculated for liquid bulk cargo and other commodities such as [[shipping container|containers]] or [[automobile|cars]]. Stowage factors for several types of cargo are presented in the following table.&lt;ref name="maritimeeconomics" /&gt;

The '''Sunday Trading Act 1994''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] governing the right of [[Retailing|shops]] in [[England and Wales]] to trade on a Sunday. Buying and selling on Sunday had previously been illegal, with exceptions, under the [[Shops Act 1950]].

==Background==
Following the defeat of the [[Shops Bill 1986]], which would have enabled widespread Sunday trading, compromise legislation was introduced in July 1994 in [[England and Wales]], coming into force on 26 August 1994,&lt;ref name="si-1994-1841"/&gt; allowing shops to open, but restricting opening times of larger stores i.e. those over {{convert|280|m2|sqft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} to a maximum of six hours, between 10am and 6pm only. Large retail park shops usually open 11am-5pm, with supermarkets more usually choosing 10am-4pm. In central [[London]], for example on [[Oxford Street]], many shops choose to open from midday to 6pm. This includes large 24-hour supermarkets, which meant that supermarkets have to close on Saturday night to allow six continuous hour shopping within an allotted time.

However, some of the stores open half an hour earlier to allow people to "browse", but do not allow sales before the allotted time. Deliveries to the large stores are not permitted to be loaded or unloaded before 9am. Large shops were excluded from opening on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day (when it fell on a Sunday), but the [[Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004]] made it illegal for large shops to open on Christmas Day whichever day of the week it fell on.

Shops in [[Scotland]], where Sunday trading had always been generally unregulated, retained the right to open at any time. However the right for workers in Scotland to refuse to work on a Sunday was later conferred by the [[Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003]]. [[Northern Ireland]] has separate laws governing Sunday opening.

The Sunday Trading Bill had met with considerable opposition from the [[Lord's Day Observance Society]] and other groups such as the [[Keep Sunday Special]] campaign, a coalition body which includes the shopworkers' [[trade union]] [[USDAW]]. USDAW finally agreed to support 6 hour Sunday trading in return for a promise that Sunday working would be strictly voluntary. This decision played an important role in encouraging many Labour MPs to back the bill in a free vote. They asked for a guarantee of premium pay but the Government's position was that that was a matter for negotiation between shopworkers or their unions and their employers and the Act as passed says nothing about the rate of pay for Sunday working.

==2012 suspension==
In the run up to the 2012 Olympic Games, the Sunday Trading (London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games) Act 2012 was passed stipulating that Sunday trading laws would be suspended by the government on eight weekends from 22 July during the Olympics and Paralympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18942729 | title=London 2012: Sunday trading laws suspended for Olympics | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=BBC News | date=22 July 2012 | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a temporary measure, and the relaxation expired at the end of the summer.

==Ongoing debate==
The debate over Sunday trading laws was reignited in 2014, when a comres poll commissioned by newly formed grassroots organisation 'Open Sundays' revealed that 72% of people believe they should be able to shop whenever is convenient to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.retail-week.com/topics/retail-surgery/should-sunday-trading-hours-be-reformed/5058898.article&lt;/ref&gt; The debate gained further political traction in May of the same year, when [[Philip Davies]] MP tabled five amendments to the Deregulation Bill which aimed at abolishing or liberalising the current Sunday trading laws.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/stores/mp-tables-amendments-to-scrap-or-ease-sunday-trading-rules/357559.article&lt;/ref&gt; Although these amendments were ultimately rejected,&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140623/debtext/140623-0003.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the debate is continuing to receive attention, with Davies appearing on the BBC's Daily Politics on 2 July 2014 and labelling the current regulations as "completely absurd and unjustifiable". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b048s6ds/daily-politics-02072014&lt;/ref&gt;

It was proposed in the July 2015 Budget that the Sunday trading laws might be relaxed and shops over  {{convert|280|m2|sqft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} be able to open longer. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33421315&lt;/ref&gt; However this proposal was defeated in a House of Commons vote.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35768674&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exemptions==
Some categories of large shops are exempt from the Sunday Trading Act 1994:

*Airport shops
*Pharmacies
*Goods from exhibition stalls
*Farm shops that sell their own produce (including fishmongers)
*Petrol filling stations
*Railway stations
*Motorway service stations

Small shops with a floor area of under and up to 280 square metres (3,000 square feet) may open if they wish to.

'''Synergy''' is the creation of a whole that is greater than the simple sum of its parts.  The term ''synergy'' comes from the [[Attic Greek]] word συνεργία ''{{lang|el-Latn|synergia}}''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=synergy "synergy"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; from ''{{lang|el-Latn|synergos}}'', {{lang|el|[[wikt:συνεργός|συνεργός]]}}, meaning "working together".

==History==
The words "synergy" and "synergetic" have been used in the field of [[physiology]] since at least the middle of the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
SYN'ERGY, ''Synergi'a'', ''Synenergi'a'', (F.) ''Synergie''; from ''συν'', 'with,' and ''εργον'', 'work.' A correlation or concourse of action between different organs in health; and, according to some, in disease.
:—Dunglison, Robley [https://books.google.com/books?id=jAm6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA835 ''Medical Lexicon''] Blanchard and Lea, 1853
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1896, [[:fr:Henri Mazel|Henri Mazel]] applied the term "synergy" to social psychology by writing ''La synergie sociale'', in which he argued that Darwinian theory failed to account for "social synergy" or "social love", a collective evolutionary drive. The highest civilizations were the work not only of the elite but of the masses too; those masses must be led, however, because the crowd, a feminine and unconscious force, cannot distinguish between good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;Werth, Margaret [https://books.google.com/books?id=-gDaqOcUMhgC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=%22social+synergy%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22social%20synergy%22 ''The Joy of Life: The Idyllic in French Art'', circa 1900] University of California Press, 2002, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Lester Frank Ward]] defined synergy as the universal constructive principle of nature:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have characterized the social struggle as centrifugal and social solidarity as centripetal. Either alone is productive of evil consequences. Struggle is essentially destructive of the social order, while communism removes individual initiative. The one leads to disorder, the other to degeneracy. What is not seen—the truth that has no expounders—is that the wholesome, constructive movement consists in the properly ordered combination and interaction of both these principles. This is ''social synergy'', which is a form of cosmic synergy, the universal constructive principle of nature.
:—Ward, Lester F. [https://archive.org/stream/glimpsescosmos00wardgoog#page/n405/mode/1up/search/synergy ''Glimpses of the Cosmos'', volume VI (1897–1912)] G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1918, p. 358
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Descriptions and usages==
In the natural world, synergistic phenomena are ubiquitous, ranging from physics (for example, the different combinations of quarks that produce protons and neutrons) to chemistry (a popular example is water, a compound of hydrogen and oxygen), to the cooperative interactions among the genes in genomes, the division of labor in bacterial colonies, the synergies of scale in multi-cellular organisms, as well as the many different kinds of synergies produced by socially-organized groups, from honeybee colonies to wolf packs and human societies: compare [[stigmergy]], a mechanism of indirect coordination between agents or actions that results in the [[self-assembly]] of [[complex system]]s. Even the tools and technologies that are widespread in the natural world represent important sources of synergistic effects. The tools that enabled early [[hominin]]s to become systematic big-game hunters is a primordial human example.&lt;ref&gt;Peter A. Corning, ''Nature's Magic: Synergy in Evolution and the Fate of Humankind'', New York: Cambridge University Press 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-82547-4}}; Peter A. Corning, ''Holistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics and the Bioeconomics of Evolution'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2005 {{ISBN|0-226-11613-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the context of organizational behavior, following the view that a cohesive group is more than the sum of its parts, synergy is the ability of a group to outperform even its best individual member. These conclusions are derived from the studies conducted by Jay Hall on a number of laboratory-based group ranking and prediction tasks. He found that effective groups actively looked for the points in which they disagreed and in consequence encouraged conflicts amongst the participants in the early stages of the discussion. In contrast, the ineffective groups felt a need to establish a common view quickly, used simple decision making methods such as averaging, and focused on completing the task rather than on finding solutions they could agree on.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchanan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text. Prentice Hall, pp 276, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a technical context, its meaning is a construct or collection of different elements working together to produce results not obtainable by any of the elements alone. The elements, or parts, can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, documents: all things required to produce system-level results. The value added by the system as a whole, beyond that contributed independently by the parts, is created primarily by the relationship among the parts, that is, how they are interconnected. In essence, a system constitutes a set of interrelated components working together with a common objective: fulfilling some designated need.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Blanchard, System Engineering Management, pp 8, John Wiley 2004, {{ISBN|0-471-29176-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If used in a business application, synergy means that teamwork will produce an overall better result than if each person within the group were working toward the same goal individually. However, the concept of group [[cohesion (social policy)|cohesion]] needs to be considered. Group cohesion is that property that is inferred from the number and strength of mutual positive attitudes among members of the group. As the group becomes more cohesive, its functioning is affected in a number of ways. First, the interactions and communication between members increase. Common goals, interests and small size all contribute to this. In addition, group member satisfaction increases as the group provides friendship and support against outside threats.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchanan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text, Prentice Hall, pp 275, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are negative aspects of group cohesion that have an effect on group decision-making and hence on group effectiveness. There are two issues arising. The [[risky shift]] phenomenon is the tendency of a group to make decisions that are riskier than those that the group would have recommended individually. Group [[Polarization (politics)|Polarisation]] is when individuals in a group begin by taking a moderate stance on an issue regarding a common value and, after having discussed it, end up taking a more extreme stance.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchannan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text. Prentice Hall, pp 280, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second, potential negative consequence of group cohesion is group think. Group think is a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in cohesive group, when the members' striving for unanimity overrides their motivation to appraise realistically the alternative courses of action. Studying the events of several American policy "disasters" such as the failure to anticipate the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] (1941) and the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] fiasco (1961), Irving Janis argued that they were due to the cohesive nature of the committees that made the relevant decisions.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchanan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text. Prentice Hall, pp 283, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That decisions made by committees lead to failure in a simple system is noted by Dr. Chris Elliot. His case study looked at [[IEEE-488]], an international standard set by the leading US standards body; it led to a failure of small automation systems using the IEEE-488 standard (which codified a proprietary communications standard [[HP-IB]]). But the external devices used for communication were made by two different companies, and the incompatibility between the external devices led to a financial loss for the company. He argues that systems will be safe only if they are designed, not if they emerge by chance.&lt;ref&gt;:Dr Chris Elliot, System safety and Law, Proceedings of First International Conference on System Safety, Institution of Engineering and Technology, London,  pp 344-351(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The idea of a systemic approach is endorsed by the [[United Kingdom]] [[Health and Safety Executive]]. The successful performance of the health and safety management depends upon the analyzing the causes of incidents and accidents and learning correct lessons from them. The idea is that all events (not just those causing injuries) represent failures in control, and present an opportunity for learning and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;UK Health and Safety Executive, ''Successful health and safety management'', {{ISBN|978-0-7176-1276-5}},(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; UK Health and Safety Executive, ''Successful health and safety management'' (1997): this book describes the principles and management practices, which provide the basis of effective health and safety management. It sets out the issues that need to be addressed, and can be used for developing improvement programs, self-audit, or self-assessment. Its message is that organizations must manage health and safety with the same degree of expertise and to the same standards as other core business activities, if they are to effectively control risks and prevent harm to people.

The term synergy was refined by [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], who analyzed some of its implications more fully&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s01/p0100.html SYNERGETICS Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking by R. Buckminster Fuller (online version)]&lt;/ref&gt; and coined the term [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R. B., (1975), ''Synergetics: Explorations In The Geometry Of Thinking'', in collaboration with E. J. Applewhite. Introduction and contribution by Arthur L. Loeb. Macmillan Publishing Company, Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A dynamic state in which combined action is favored over the difference of individual component actions.
* Behavior of whole systems unpredicted by the behavior of their parts taken separately, known as [[emergent behavior]].
* The cooperative action of two or more stimuli (or drugs), resulting in a different or greater response than that of the individual stimuli.

==Biological sciences==
Synergy of various kinds has been advanced by [[Peter Corning]] as a causal agency that can explain the progressive evolution of complexity in living systems over the course of time. According to the Synergism Hypothesis, synergistic effects have been the drivers of cooperative relationships of all kinds and at all levels in living systems. The thesis, in a nutshell, is that synergistic effects have often provided functional advantages (economic benefits) in relation to survival and reproduction that have been favored by natural selection.  The cooperating parts, elements, or individuals become, in effect, functional “units” of selection in evolutionary change.&lt;ref&gt;Peter A. Corning, The Synergism Hypothesis: A Theory of Progressive Evolution, New York, McGraw Hill 1983 {{ISBN|0-07-013166-X}}; Peter A. Corning, Holistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics and the Bio economics of Evolution, Chicago, University of Chicago Press 2005 {{ISBN|0-226-11613-1}};[http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/synselforg.pdf Synergy and self-organization in the evolution of complex systems.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720103635/http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/synselforg.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, environmental systems may react in a non-linear way to perturbations, such as climate change, so that the outcome may be greater than the sum of the individual component alterations. Synergistic responses are a complicating factor in environmental modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N ''Environmental Unknowns'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pest synergy===
Pest synergy would occur in a [[biology|biological]] [[Host (biology)|host]] [[organism]] population, where, for example, the introduction of [[parasite]] A may cause 10% fatalities, and parasite B may also cause 10% loss. When both parasites are present, the losses would normally be expected to total less than 20%, yet, in some cases, losses are significantly greater. In such cases, it is said that the parasites in combination have a synergistic effect.

=== Drug synergy ===
Mechanisms that may be involved in the development of synergistic effects include:
*Effect on the same cellular system (e.g. two different [[antibiotics]] like a [[penicillin]] and an [[aminoglycoside]]; penicillins damage the cell wall of gram-positive [[bacteria]] and improve the penetration of aminoglycosides).&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Tripathi: ''Essentials of Medical Pharmacology G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series''. JP Medical Ltd, 2013, {{ISBN|9789350259375}}, page 698.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Prevention or delay of degradation in the body (e.g. the antibiotic [[Ciprofloxacin]] inhibits the metabolism of [[Theophylline]]).&lt;ref name="Tripathi931"&gt;K. D. Tripathi: ''Essentials of Medical Pharmacology G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series''. JP Medical Ltd, 2013, {{ISBN|9789350259375}}, page 931.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Slowdown of excretion (e.g. [[Probenecid]] delays the [[renal]] excretion of Penicillin and thus prolongs its effect).&lt;ref name="Tripathi931"/&gt;
*Anticounteractive action: for example, the effect of [[oxaliplatin]] and [[irinotecan]]. Oxaliplatin [[wikt:intercalation|intercalates]] DNA, thereby preventing the cell from replicating DNA. Irinotecan inhibits [[topoisomerase 1]], consequently the cytostatic effect is increased.&lt;ref name="Jia2009"&gt;Jia Jia et al: "Mechanisms of drug combinations: interaction and network perspectives." Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 8, 111-130, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*Effect on the same receptor but different sites (e.g. the coadministration of benzodiazepines and barbiturates, both act by enhancing the action of GABA on GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, but benzodiazepines increase the frequency of channel opening, whilst barbiturates increase the channel closing time, making these two drugs dramatically enhance GABAergic neurotransmission).{{cn|date=May 2018}}

More mechanisms are described in an exhaustive 2009 review.&lt;ref name="Jia2009"/&gt;

===Toxicological synergy===
Toxicological synergy is of concern to the public and regulatory agencies because chemicals individually considered safe might pose unacceptable health or ecological risk in combination. Articles in scientific and lay journals include many definitions of chemical or toxicological synergy, often vague or in conflict with each other. Because toxic interactions are defined relative to the expectation under "no interaction", a determination of synergy (or antagonism) depends on what is meant by "no interaction".&lt;ref&gt;Hertzberg, R. C., and MacDonell, M. M. (2002). Synergy and other ineffective mixture risk definitions. Sci Total Environ 288, 31-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has one of the more detailed and precise definitions of toxic interaction, designed to facilitate risk assessment.&lt;ref name="EPAMixRisk"&gt;[http://ofmpub.epa.gov/eims/eimscomm.getfile?p_download_id=4486], U.S. EPA (2000). Supplementary Guidance for Conducting Health Risk Assessment of Chemical Mixtures. Risk Assessment Forum, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; In their guidance documents, the no-interaction default assumption is dose addition, so synergy means a mixture response that exceeds that predicted from dose addition. The EPA emphasizes that synergy does not always make a mixture dangerous, nor does antagonism always make the mixture safe; each depends on the predicted risk under dose addition.

For example, a consequence of pesticide use is the risk of health effects. During the registration of [[pesticide]]s in the [[United States]] exhaustive tests are performed to discern health effects on humans at various exposure levels. A regulatory upper limit of presence in foods is then placed on this pesticide. As long as residues in the food stay below this regulatory level, health effects are deemed highly unlikely and the food is considered safe to consume.

However, in normal agricultural practice, it is rare to use only a single pesticide. During the production of a crop, several different materials may be used. Each of them has had determined a regulatory level at which they would be considered individually safe. In many cases, a commercial pesticide is itself a combination of several chemical agents, and thus the safe levels actually represent levels of the mixture. In contrast, a combination created by the end user, such as a farmer, has rarely been tested in that combination. The potential for synergy is then unknown or estimated from data on similar combinations.  This lack of information also applies to many of the chemical combinations to which humans are exposed, including residues in food, indoor air contaminants, and occupational exposures to chemicals. Some groups think that the rising rates of cancer, asthma, and other health problems may be caused by these combination exposures; others have alternative explanations. This question will likely be answered only after years of exposure by the population in general and research on chemical toxicity, usually performed on animals. Examples of pesticide synergists include [[Piperonyl butoxide]] and [[MGK 264]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/reevaluation/pyrethroids-pyrethrins.html Pyrethroids and Pyrethrins], U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, epa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human synergy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
Human synergy relates to  human interaction and teamwork. For example, say person A alone is too short to reach an [[apple]] on a [[tree]] and person B is too short as well. Once person B sits on the [[shoulder]]s of person A, they are tall enough to reach the apple. In this example, the product of their synergy would be one apple. Another case would be two [[politician]]s. If each is able to gather one million votes on their own, but together they were able to appeal to 2.5 million voters, their synergy would have produced 500,000 more votes than had they each worked independently. A [[song]] is also a good example of human synergy, taking more than one musical part and putting them together to create a song that has a much more dramatic effect than each of the parts when played individually.

A third form of human synergy is when one person is able to complete two separate tasks by doing one action, for example, if a person were asked by a [[teacher]] and his [[supervisor|boss]] at work to write an [[essay]] on how he could improve his work.  A more visual example of this synergy is a [[drummer]] using four separate [[rhythm]]s to create one [[drum]] beat.

Synergy usually arises when two persons with different complementary skills cooperate.  In business, cooperation of people with organizational and technical skills happens very often. In general, the most common reason why people cooperate is that it brings a synergy. On the other hand, people tend to specialize just to be able to form groups with high synergy (see also [[division of labor]] and [[teamwork]]).

Example: Two teams in System Administration working together to combine technical and organizational skills in order to better the client experience, thus creating synergy. Counter-examples can be found in books like [[The Mythical Man-Month]], in which the addition of additional team members is shown to have negative effects on productivity.

[[Organismic computing]] is an approach to improving group efficacy by increasing synergy in human groups via technological means.

When synergy occurs in the work place, the individuals involved get to work in a positive and supportive working environment.  When individuals get to work in environments such as these, the company reaps the benefits.  The authors of ''Creating the Best Workplace on Earth'' Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones, state that "highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations that the least-engaged workers.  And companies with highly engaged people outperform firms with the most disengaged folks- by 54% in employee retention, by 89% in customer satisfaction, and by fourfold in revenue growth (Goffee &amp; Jones, pg. 100)."  Also, those that are able to be open about their views on the company, and have confidence that they will be heard, are likely to be a more organized employee who helps his/ her fellow team members succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Goffee, R. &amp; Jones, G.  (2013).  Creating the best workplace on the earth.  Harvard Business Review, 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate synergy==
{{main|corporate synergy}}
[[Corporate synergy]] occurs when corporations interact congruently.  A corporate synergy refers to a financial benefit that a corporation
expects to realize when it merges with or acquires another corporation.  This type of synergy is a nearly ubiquitous feature of a corporate acquisition and is a negotiating point between the buyer and seller that impacts the final price both parties agree to. There are distinct types of corporate synergies, as follows.

===Marketing===
A marketing synergy refers to the use of information campaigns, studies, and scientific discovery or experimentation for research or development. This promotes the sale of products for varied use or off-market sales as well as development of marketing tools and in several cases exaggeration of effects. It is also often a meaningless buzzword used by corporate leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Synergy Myth: And Other Ailments Of Business Today |edition= |first1=Harold |last1=Geneen |first2=Brent |last2=Bowers |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-312-14724-2 |page=xii |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=3nNwQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond Political Correctness: Social Transformation in the United States |edition= |first1=Michael S. |last1=Cummings |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-58826-006-2 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mgAwXas5xIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7mgAwXas5xIC&amp;pg=PA92 Extract of page 92]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenue===
A revenue synergy refers to the opportunity of a combined corporate entity to generate more revenue than its two predecessor stand-alone companies would be able to generate. For example, if company A sells product X through its sales force, company B sells product Y, and company A decides to buy company B then the new company could use each sales person to sell products X and Y, thereby increasing the revenue that each sales person generates for the company.

In media revenue, synergy is the promotion and sale of a product throughout the various subsidiaries of a media conglomerate, e.g. films, soundtracks, or video games.

===Financial===
Financial synergy gained by the combined firm is a result of number of benefits which flow to the entity as a consequence of acquisition and merger. These benefits may be:

====Cash slack====
This is when a firm having number of cash extensive projects acquires a firm which is cash-rich, thus enabling the new combined firm to enjoy the profits from investing the cash of one firm in the projects of the other.

====Debt capacity====
If two firms have no or little capacity to carry debt before individually, it is possible for them to join and gain the capacity to carry the debt through decreased gearing (leverage).  This creates value for the firm, as debt is thought to be a cheaper source of finance.

====Tax benefits====
It is possible for one firm to have unused tax benefits which might be offset against the profits of another after combination, thus resulting in less tax being paid. However this greatly depends on the tax law of the country.

===Management===
Synergy in management and in relation to teamwork refers to the combined effort of individuals as participants of the team.&lt;ref name="law2003"&gt;Lawford, G. R. (2003). Beyond success: Achieving synergy in teamwork. ''The Journal for Quality and Participation'', 26(3), p 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The condition that exists when the organization's parts interact to produce a joint effect that is greater than the sum of the parts acting alone. Positive or negative synergies can exist. In these cases, positive synergy has positive effects such as improved efficiency in operations, greater exploitation of opportunities, and improved utilization of resources. Negative synergy on the other hand has negative effects such as: reduced efficiency of operations, decrease in quality, underutilization of resources and disequilibrium with the external environment.

===Cost===
A cost synergy refers to the opportunity of a combined corporate entity to reduce or eliminate expenses associated with running a business. Cost synergies are realized by eliminating positions that are viewed as duplicate within the merged entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costsynergy.asp Cost Synergy, ''investopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the headquarters office of one of the predecessor companies, certain executives, the human resources department, or other employees of the predecessor companies. This is related to the economic concept of [[Returns to scale|economies of scale]].

==Synergistic action in economy==
The synergistic action of the economic players lies within the economic phenomenon's profundity. The synergistic action gives different dimensions to competitiveness, strategy and network identity becoming an unconventional "weapon" which belongs to those who exploit the economic systems’ potential in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synergistic determinants===
The synergistic gravity equation (SYNGEq), according to its complex “title”, represents a synthesis of the endogenous and exogenous factors which determine the private and non-private economic decision makers to call to actions of synergistic exploitation of the economic network in which they operate. That is to say, SYNGEq constitutes a big picture of the factors/motivations which determine the entrepreneurs to contour an active synergistic network. SYNGEq includes both factors which character is changing over time (such as the competitive conditions), as well as classics factors, such as the imperative of the access to resources of the collaboration and the quick answers. The synergistic gravity equation (SINGEq) comes to be represented by the formula:&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 33 and 37&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;∑SYN.Act = ∑R-*I(CRed+COOP&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt;+A&lt;sup&gt;Unimit.&lt;/sup&gt;)*V(Cust.+Info.)*cc&lt;/center&gt;

where:
*∑SYN.Act = the sum of the synergistic actions adopted (by the economic actor)
*∑ R- = the amount of unpurchased but necessary resources
*ICRed = the imperative for cost reductions
*ICOOP&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt; = the imperative for deep cooperation (functional interdependence)
*IA&lt;sup&gt;Unimit.&lt;/sup&gt; = the imperative for purchasing unimitable competitive advantages (for the economic actor)
*VCust = the necessity of customer value in purchasing future profits and competitive advantages VInfo = the necessity of informational value in purchasing future profits and competitive advantages
*cc = the specific competitive conditions in which the economic actor operates

===Synergistic networks and systems===
The synergistic network represents an integrated part of the economic system which, through the coordination and control functions (of the undertaken economic actions), agrees synergies. The networks which promote synergistic actions can be divided in horizontal synergistic networks and vertical synergistic networks.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synergy effects===
The synergy effects are difficult (even impossible) to imitate by competitors and difficult to reproduce by their authors because these effects depend on the combination of factors with time-varying characteristics. The synergy effects are often called "synergistic benefits", representing the direct and implied result of the developed/adopted synergistic actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers==
Synergy can also be defined as the combination of human strengths and computer strengths, such as [[advanced chess]]. Computers can process data much more quickly than humans, but lack the ability to respond meaningfully to arbitrary stimuli.

==Synergy in literature==
Etymologically, the "synergy" term was first used around 1600, deriving from the Greek word “synergos”, which means “to work together” or “to cooperate”. If during this period the synergy concept was mainly used in the theological field (describing “the cooperation of human effort with divine will”), in the 19th and 20th centuries, "synergy" was promoted in physics and biochemistry, being implemented in the study of the open economic systems only in the 1960 and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote an essay titled ''On Fairy Stores'', delivered at an Andrew Lang Lecture, and reprinted in his book, ''The Tolkien Reader'', published in 1966. In it, he made two references to synergy, although he did not use that term. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Faerie cannot be caught in a net of words; for it is one of its qualities to be indescribable, though not imperceptible. It has many ingredients, but analysis will not necessarily discover the secret of the whole.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And more succinctly, in a footnote, about the "part of producing the web of an intricate story", he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is indeed easier to unravel a single ''thread'' &amp;mdash; an incident, a name, a motive &amp;mdash; than to trace the history of any ''picture'' defined by many threads. For with the picture in the tapestry a new element has come in: the picture is greater than, and not explained by, the sum of the component threads.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Synergy in the media==

The informational synergies which can be applied also in media involve a compression of transmission, access and use of information’s time, the flows, circuits and means of handling information being based on a complementary, integrated, transparent and coordinated use of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In media economics, synergy is the promotion and sale of a product (and all its versions) throughout the various subsidiaries of a media conglomerate,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Richard, Christopher R. Martin, and Bettina Fabos. Media &amp; Culture 5: an Introduction to Mass Communication. Fifth Edition 2007 Update ed. Bostin: Bedford St. Martins, 2007. 606.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. films, soundtracks or video games. [[Walt Disney]] pioneered synergistic marketing techniques in the 1930s by granting dozens of firms the right to use his [[Mickey Mouse]] character in products and ads, and continued to market Disney media through licensing arrangements. These products can help advertise the film itself and thus help to increase the film's sales. For example, the [[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man films]] had toys of webshooters and figures of the characters made, as well as posters and games.&lt;ref&gt;Media Synergy see Linden Dalecki's article in Northwestern's ''Journal of Integrated Marketing Communications'' (2008) {{cite web |url=http://jimc.medill.northwestern.edu/JIMCWebsite/2008/HollywoodMediaSynergy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613230145/http://jimc.medill.northwestern.edu/JIMCWebsite/2008/HollywoodMediaSynergy.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBC sitcom [[30 Rock]] often shows the power of synergy, while also poking fun at the use of the term in the corporate world.&lt;ref&gt;30 Rock episode 3.09; Liz: "I hate those corporate things; a bunch of drunk people talking about 'synergy'." Jack: "First of all, never badmouth 'synergy'!"&lt;/ref&gt; There are also different forms of synergy in popular card games like [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]], [[Cardfight!! Vanguard]], and [[Future Card Buddyfight]].

== Information theory ==

When multiple sources of [[information theory|information]] taken together provide more information than the sum of the information provided by each source alone, there is said to be a synergy in the sources. This in contrast to the case in which the sources provide less information, in which case there is said to be a [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] in the sources.

==Early History and Growth==
Timber Lodge Steakhouse Inc. was founded under the name '''Minnesota Steakhouse''' in September 1991 in [[Burnsville, Minnesota]]. The founder of Minnesota Steakhouse, [[Doron Jensen]], changed the name to Timber Lodge in 1995 to make it more marketable in other areas of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Q-STEAKS,+INC.+ANNOUNCES+MANAGEMENT+CHANGES-a016954378 Q-Steaks, Inc. Announces Management Changes - Free Online Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the founder split off due to conflicts with his business partner, the company grew from 16 Minnesota locations to 85. Restaurants ranged from New York to Arizona under mainly the name Timber Lodge Steakhouse, with a couple exceptions (Paul Bunyans Steakhouse in New York).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n19_v29/ai_16910313/ |title=CBSi |publisher=FindArticles.com |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2017}}{{dl|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bankruptcy and Closings==
Bad locations have plagued the company and it has dwindled back down to a few Minnesota restaurants. All locations outside the state of Minnesota have closed. The chain operated 18 locations when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2006/06/26/daily6.html |title=Timber Lodge Steakhouse files for bankruptcy |publisher=Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal |date=June 26, 2006 |accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008 Taher Inc. acquired Timber Lodge Steakhouse Inc. Minnetonka-based Taher Inc., led by founder and CEO Bruce Taher, provides foodservice management for schools, senior-housing facilities and corporate cafeterias in 10 states. “They have really good food,” Bruce Taher said about Timber Lodge. “They cook from scratch, which fits our culture of chef-driven restaurants, and I think they provide a good value to customers.” Bob Campbell, who was part of the previous ownership group that consisted of 10 local investors, said it’s a good deal. “I think it’s a very positive change for Timber Lodge, our employees and our customers, and in the long run for our vendors and everyone else involved,” he said. Timber Lodge was down to ten locations by the time of its sale to Taher.&lt;ref name="bizjournals1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/print-edition/2010/12/17/35-judgment-for-timber-lodge.html |title=$3.5 million judgment for Timber Lodge Steakhouse |publisher=Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal |date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, restaurants closed in St. Cloud, MN, and Rochester, MN. As a result of the closings, a judge levied a $3.57 million judgment against Timber Lodge for not fulfilling its leases. The Fargo, ND, location closed its doors on July 24, 2010. The Sioux Falls, SD, location also closed late July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdlt.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4066&amp;Itemid=57 |title=News, Sports, and Weather Sioux Falls South Dakota |publisher=KDLT |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906131413/http://www.kdlt.com/index.php?option=com_content |archivedate=September 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bizjournals1"/&gt;

The Duluth location closed permanently on January 1, 2016. Owner Bruce Taher cited lack of customer parking, high rent, and the restaurant's large footprint as reasons for the closing. The Duluth restaurant had been located in the Waterfront Plaza building in Canal Park for 20 years. Timber Lodge now has only two remaining locations: Bloomington and Owatonna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollingsworth |first=Jana |url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/4010861-duluths-timber-lodge-steakhouse-closed-good |title=Duluth's Timber Lodge Steakhouse is closed for good |publisher=Duluth News Tribune |date=April 15, 2016 |accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Accounting and Finance (SAF)''' at [[University of Waterloo]] is a ''professional school'' within the Faculty of Arts. The School was established in 1985 under the name 'School of Accountancy'. Its name was changed in 2008 to better reflect its program offering.&lt;ref name="Vision and Challenge"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.accounting.uwaterloo.ca/history.pdf | title = Vision and Challenge: Accounting Education at the University of Waterloo 1981–2001| accessdate = 2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, nearly 1000 students are enrolled in the School's programs. In September, 2009 a new {{convert|52,000|sqft|m2|sigfig=1}} building was officially opened to house the School.

The School of Accounting and Finance offers the largest accounting and finance undergraduate [[cooperative education]] (co-op) program in Canada.&lt;ref name="The Directory of Canadian Universities"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aucc.ca/can_uni/our_universities/waterloo_e.html | title = The Directory of Canadian Universities: The University of Waterloo | accessdate = 2007-05-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607120628/http://www.aucc.ca/can_uni/our_universities/waterloo_e.html | archivedate = 2007-06-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School's [[Master of Accounting]] (MAcc) Program allows students to complete all required CPA modules within 8 months, and is only open to students who complete the School's undergrad programs. MAcc graduates only need to challenge (and pass) the [[Common Final Examination]] and accumulate the required professional experiences in order to become a [[Chartered Professional Accountant]] (CPA). MAcc and industry experiences gained from co-op is well-known among Canadian accounting and finance industries.

==Programs of Study==

The School of Accounting and Finance offers four undergraduate programs, two graduate programs and one doctoral program. Additionally, the School jointly administers one undergraduate program and one graduate program with the [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Mathematics|Faculty of Mathematics]] and one undergraduate program with the [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Science|Faculty of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=One School - Four Programs, Three Faculties |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-accounting-and-finance/undergraduate |website=University of Waterloo |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undergraduate Education==
'''Bachelor of Accounting and Financial Management Co-op (BAFM):'''
* Students in the BAFM Program build on expertise in accounting and finance starting year 1, with co-op work terms beginning in year 2. AFM students take a variety of courses such as financial accounting, managerial accounting, information technology/data science, business law, and corporate finance to satisfy the required CPA education requirements. Starting in year 3, AFM students may continue taking the CPA courses, or seek a career in finance utilizing electives to take advanced finance courses. Ample enough of elective space is allocated for BAFM students to customize their degree to focus on both CPA and finance, or to pursue a minor. 
* Graduates of the BAFM program typically aspire to a host of professional accounting and/or finance credentials such as the [[Chartered Professional Accountant]] (CPA), [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) and [[Chartered Business Valuator]] (CBV) designations. All BAFM graduates are eligible to apply to the School's MAcc program. Students in BAFM must complete 4 co-op work terms, in total of 16 months of experiences, which could be eligible for CPA accreditation purposes (30 months required).

'''Mathematics/Chartered Professional Accountancy Co-op (Math/CPA):'''
* Math/CPA students have less flexibility in their degree as students take math courses along with the accounting and finance courses BAFM students take, leaving very few elective spaces. The work-term sequence is structured similar to the BAFM schedule, with 4 co-op terms. The Math/CA program was renamed to Math/CPA in 2013.

'''Biotechnology/Chartered Professional Accountancy Co-op (Biotech/CPA):'''
* This program is offered jointly with the Faculty of Science. Students in the Biotech/CPA program take science courses along with the accounting and finance courses. Biotech/CPA students have little flexibility in their degree, and in some terms, are required to take extra courses. Biotech/CPA students composed of the smallest population in the School, with only around 10-15 students admitted per academic year. Students in the program may obtain co-op employment deemed by professional bodies to be ''qualifying practical experience'' for accreditation purposes, similar to BAFM and Math/CPA, with 4 required co-op terms. Biotech/CPA students are eligible to apply to the School's MAcc program. The Biotech/CA program was renamed to Biotech/CPA in 2013.

'''Bachelor of Computing and Financial Management (BCFM):'''

Students in this program typically complete six co-op work terms, with the first commencing between semester two and three. CFM students/graduates are not eligible to apply to the School's MAcc program and are unable to take advantage of the CPA accreditation.

==Postgraduate Education==
'''Master of Accounting (MAcc):'''
* This 8-month program is accredited by [[CPA Canada]], so students who successfully complete the program, including all CPA requirements, are exempt from all 6 modules of the CPA Professional Education Program and may proceed directly to the Common Final Examination (CFE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Master of Accounting |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-academic-calendar/arts/school-accounting-and-finance/master-accounting-macc |website=Graduate Studies Academic Calendar |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from gaining depth in the CPA elective subjects including Taxation, Assurance, Performance Management and Finance, MAcc students can explore other career options such as business valuations, forensic accounting, data analytics, internal audit and international tax. Approximately 65% of undergrads pursue the MAcc degree in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School of Accounting and Finance annual reports |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-accounting-and-finance/sites/ca.school-of-accounting-and-finance/files/uploads/files/c015268_saf_coop_career_launch_report_print_lr_accessible-s.pdf |website=School of Accounting &amp; Finance |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zhongguancun''' ({{zh|first=s|s=中关村|t=中關村|p=Zhōngguāncūn}}), or '''Zhong Guan Cun''', is a technology hub in [[Haidian District]], [[Beijing]], [[China]].

It is geographically situated in the northwestern part of Beijing city, in a band between the northwestern [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|Third Ring Road]] and the northwestern [[4th Ring Road (Beijing)|Fourth Ring Road]].  Zhongguancun is very well known in China, and is often referred to as "China's [[Silicon Valley]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/51023.htm |title=Zhongguancun, China's Silicon Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
[[File:中关村广场西南景致.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The southwest landscape of Zhongguan plaza.]]
{{details|topic=the early history of the area|Haidian District}}

Zhongguancun has only existed since the 1950s and only became a household name in the early 1980s. The first person who envisioned the future for Zhongguancun was [[Chen Chunxian]], a member of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (CAS), who came up with the idea for a [[Silicon Valley]] in China after he visited the U.S. as part of a government-sponsored trip. The location of the Chinese Academy of Sciences within Zhongguancun reinforced, and perhaps was in part responsible for the technological growth in this area.

Throughout the 1980s and still today, Zhongguancun was known as "electronics avenue," because of its connections to information technology and the preponderance of stores along a central, crowded street.

Zhongguancun was officially recognized by the central government of China in 1988. It was given the wordy name "Beijing High-Technology Industry Development Experimental Zone."

The current designation Zhongguancun refers commonly to the original site. However, officially (as of 1999) Zhongguancun has become the "Zhongguancun Science &amp; Technology Zone." It is a zone with seven parks, including Haidian Park, Fengtai Park, Changping Park, Electronics City (in Chaoyang), Yizhuang Park, Desheng Park, and Jianxiang Park.

The original Zhongguancun is now known as the Haidian Park of the Zhongguancun Zone. The area and environs, however, remain the same.

==Notable areas==
[[File:中关村科技园全景图.jpg|thumb|Panorama of tech hub.]]
[[File:20030511021028 - 中关村.jpg|thumb|Inside the Hailong market building.]]
[[Hailong Market]], [[Guigu Market]], [[Taipingyang Market]], [[Dinghao Market]] and [[Kemao Market]] are the five prominent IT and electronics markets. They are technology bazaars, famous for their "shops with a shop", where prices are easily but grudgingly bargained. Zhongguancun shops mainly deal in [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]-compatible hardware, peripherals and software. AppleCentre and Apple Experience Centre are also close by.

A very particular sight to visit is the [[Haidian Christian Church]], designed by Hamburg-based architects [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch-times.com/2010/05/22/zhongguancun-christian-church-gmp-architekten/ Zhongguancun Christian Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable education and research centres==
Due to the proximity and participation of China's two most prestigious universities, [[Peking University]] and [[Tsinghua University]], along with the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], many analysts elsewhere are optimistic about Zhongguancun's future prospects.

Notable high schools in Zhongguancun include [[Affiliated High School of Peking University]] and [[High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China]].

==Government and infrastructure==
The [[State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs]] (SAFEA) has its headquarters in Zhongguancun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safea.gov.cn/ Home]. [[State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs]]. Retrieved on July 12, 2017. "邮编：100873 地址：北京中关村南大街一号5号楼 "&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable companies==
The most famous companies that grew up in Zhongguancun are [[Stone Group]], [[Founder Group]], and [[Lenovo Group]]. They were all founded in 1984-85. Stone was the first successful technology company to be operated by private individuals outside the government of China. Founder is a technology company that spun off [[Peking University]]. Lenovo Group spun off from [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] with [[Liu Chuanzhi]], a hero of Zhongguancun and current Chairmain, eventually taking the helm. Lenovo purchased IBM's PC division with $1.75 billion in 2005, making it the world's third-largest PC maker. Both Founder and Lenovo Group maintain strong connections to their academic backers, who are significant shareholders.

According to the 2004 Beijing Statistical Yearbook, there are over 12,000 high-tech enterprises throughout Zhongguancun's seven parks, with 489,000 technicians employed.

[[Eastdawn Corporation]] is in the [[Sinosteel]] building.

Many world-renowned technology companies built their Chinese headquarters and research centers in Zhongguancun Technology Park, such as [[Google]], [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Motorola]], [[myspace|MySpace]], [[Sony]], [[Samsung|Solstice]]&lt;!--now part of Samsung--&gt;, and [[Ericsson]]. [[Microsoft]] has built its Chinese research headquarters in the park that costs $280 million and can accommodate 5000 employees, which was completed in April, 2011, and now houses  [[Microsoft Research Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/asia/ |title= Microsoft Research Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development center of [[Loongson]], which is China's first general-purpose [[microprocessor]] design, is also in the Zhongguancun area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ict.ac.cn/english/contact/channel/2455.shtml Institute Of Computing Technology Chinese Academy Of Sciences] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919125039/http://www.ict.ac.cn/english/contact/channel/2455.shtml |date=September 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many conferences are held in this location, including the annual [[ChinICT]] conference - which is the largest Information technology Development and Entrepreneurship event in China.

==Transportation==
[[Beijing Subway]] [[Line 4, Beijing Subway|Line 4]] runs through the Zhongguancun area with stops at [[Zhongguancun Station]] and [[Haidianhuangzhuang Station]].  Haidianhuangzhuang is also a transfer station with [[Line 10, Beijing Subway|Line 10]].  In addition to the subway, Zhongguancun is served by many of Beijing's [[Beijing Bus|public buses]]- 26, 302, 304, 307, 332, 333, 355, 365, 384, 386, 466, 498, 549, 579, 584, 601, 608, 611, 614, 630, 634, 641, 653, 671, 681, 689, 696, 697, 699, 717, 740, 913, 944, 982, 983, 特4, 特6, 特9, 特15, 特18, 夜8, 夜9, 运通105, 运通106, 运通109, 运通110, and 运通113.
