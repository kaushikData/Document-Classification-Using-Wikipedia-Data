'''Albany Street''' is a short street in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan]] in [[New York City]].  The street runs west-to-east from the [[Battery Park City]] Esplanade along the [[Hudson River]] to [[Greenwich Street]], passing through South End Avenue and [[West Side Highway|West Street]] on the way.  The street has a walkway connection to the [[West Street pedestrian bridges#Rector Street Bridge|Rector Street Bridge]] which crosses West Street.

== History ==
According to maps drawn by David Valentine, the street did not exist before 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite map |last= Valentine |first= David Thomas |url = https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/7e6c20f0-0f77-0132-7ee0-58d385a7bbd0 |title = Plan of the City of New York and its Environs Surveyed in 1782 and Drawn 1785 |year=1785|scale= Scale not given |location= New York |publisher = New York Common Council |via= New York Public Library |access-date =  March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1789, it was a small extension of Thames Street. In 1797, the first pier on the west side of the island was built. The pier was used as the dock for the ferry between New York and [[Albany, New York|Albany]], hence the street leading to the pier was named "Albany Street".&lt;ref name=moscow&gt;{{cite streetbook}}, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite naming|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1850s, it was proposed that the street be extended through the yard next to [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] in order to connect the street to [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1853/12/21/archives/city-improvements-proposed-extension-of-albanystreetreport-of-the.html|title=City Improvements; Proposed Extension of Albany-street - Report of the street Committee of the Board of Aldermen |date=December 21, 1853 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author=Staff|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1858/06/01/78855806.pdf |title=News of the Day|date=June 1, 1858 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moscow /&gt; The proposition became the center of a heated debate between the Municipal Corporation of New York and the Religious Corporation of Trinity Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff  |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1854/02/11/75362806.pdf |title=Desecration of Trinity Church-Yard.; Copy of a letter from his Honor the Recorder to Alderman Francis |date=February 11, 1854 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1858/03/29/78532577.pdf|title=Law Intelligence: The Continuation of Albany Street|date=March 29, 1858 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Battery Park City was built on [[land reclamation|landfill]] in the Hudson River in the 1980s, the street was extended west of West Street into the new development.

==Buildings==
The [[Deutsche Bank Building]] was located on the north side of the street, but was heavily damaged in the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.

Buildings on Albany Street include the 1907 [[90 West Street]], also known as the West Street Building, a [[New York City landmark]] (1998) designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], and [[130 Cedar Street]], formerly the 12-story Green Exchange Building, designed by Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Guard and completed in 1931. The building was devastated in the September 11 attacks, and redeveloped into the 19-story [[Club Quarters]] hotel, which opened in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/176364/club-quarters-world-trade-center-new-york-city-ny-usa|title=Club Quarters World Trade Center|last=|first=|date=|website=emporis.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtownny.com/sites/default/files/research/Hotel%20Inventory%20Q4%202014.pdf "Hotel Inventory Q4 2014"] Alliance for Downtown New York&lt;/ref&gt; Other hotels on Albany Street are the [[W Hotels|W New York Downtown]] at 8 Albany Street,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnewyorkdowntown.com/ W New York Downtown website]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Marriott Hotels|New York Marriott Downtown]], located at 85 West Street at the corner of Albany Street,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/nycws-new-york-marriott-downtown/ New York Marriott Downtown website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the World Center Hotel at 144 Washington Street at Albany Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcenterhotel.com/ World Center Hotel website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arbitration Act 1979''' (c.42) was an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that reformed arbitration law in [[England and Wales]]. Prior to 1979, arbitration law was based on the [[Arbitration Act 1950]], which allowed use of the "[[Case Stated]]" procedure and other methods of judicial intervention, which marked English arbitration law as significantly different from that of other jurisdictions. The prior law significantly increased the cost and time required for arbitration, which made England an unpopular jurisdiction to conduct such negotiations in. As a result, while London maintained its traditional position as a centre for arbitration in insurance, admiralty and commodities trading, it failed to attract more modern forms of trade. Following pressure from industry groups, the [[Lord Chancellor]] introduced the Arbitration Bill into Parliament, having it passed hours before the dissolution of [[James Callaghan]]'s government. It was given the [[Royal Assent]] on 4 April 1979, and commenced working on 1 August 1979.

The Act completely abolished the "Case Stated" procedure and other forms of judicial interference, replacing it with a limited system of appeal to the [[High Court of Justice]] and [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]]; it also allowed for exclusion agreements limiting the rights of parties to arbitration to appeal to the courts, and gave arbitrators the ability to enforce [[interlocutory order]]s. Academics met the Act with a mixed response; while some praised it for bringing English law more into line with that of other nations, others criticised the wording used as unnecessarily complex and hazy. The Act did, in the eyes of some commentators, lead to a shift in judicial policy away from [[legal certainty]] and towards a system focused on speed and finality. Having been repealed in its entirety by Section 107(2) of the [[Arbitration Act 1996]], the Act is no longer in force.

==Background==

===Previous law===
London was historically a centre for trade and arbitration, which Peter S. Smedresman, writing in the ''Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce'' divides into three categories of transaction. English commodities trading, through bodies such as the [[Baltic Exchange]], specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in London, even when the goods being traded have no relation to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Smedresman (1979) p.319&lt;/ref&gt; London has also been a centre for arbitration on maritime issues, and insurance. However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or high-technology projects, due to the nature of its arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Smedresman (1979) p.320&lt;/ref&gt;

In most nations, arbitrators can apply the principle of "amiable composition"; the case is decided under broad, sweeping principles of [[equity (law)|equity]], without judicial oversight or the application of national commercial law. In England, this was not the case; the [[Arbitration Act 1950]], in Section 22(1), allowed the courts to instruct an arbitrator to "correct" his decision, if it had an incorrect statement of law immediately obvious. In response to this, English arbitrators simply stopped giving reasons for their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Smedresman (1979) p.321&lt;/ref&gt; The second form of judicial oversight was found in Section 21, and was an application of the "[[Case Stated]]" procedure. This allowed judicial review of a decision by the [[High Court of Justice]], and was regularly applied during the 1970s, because the freeze on interest rates during a delayed case made it attractive for debtors to delay; conversely, this made London a far less attractive venue for creditors.&lt;ref name=smed322&gt;Smedresman (1979) p.322&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1979 Act, English law did not provide many ways to avoid the Case Stated procedure, even prohibiting parties from agreeing in advance not to use it; this was due to [[Thomas Edward Scrutton|Scrutton LJ]]'s statement, in ''[[Czarnikow v Roth, Schmidt &amp; Co]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1922] 2 KB 478&lt;/ref&gt; that "There must be no [[Alsatia]] in England where the King's writ does not run".&lt;ref name=smed322/&gt; In ''[[The Lysland]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1973] 1 QB 843&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] gave a decision interpreted as saying that the courts must consider a Case Stated "even if there is no great some in dispute, no point of general importance is involved or the answer is reasonably clear".&lt;ref&gt;Smedresman (1979) p.323&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Denning]]'s statement in that case has been described as "[T]he death knell of arbitrator autonomy", and led to arbitrators almost automatically asking for judicial supervision for fear that they would otherwise be found to have committed misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe (1989) p.185&lt;/ref&gt; For obvious reasons, companies and parties to a case who submit their issues to arbitration expect something private, quick, and cheap, with fixed results. The traditional English emphasis on judicial oversight, therefore, meant that with the Case Stated procedure, London was a highly unpopular venue for arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;Shenton (1980) p.644&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the Act===
[[File:James Callaghan.JPG|thumb|right|[[James Callaghan]]; a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|motion of no confidence]] in his government forced the passage of the Act through the House of Commons in a few hours.]]
By the 1960s, even before the increase of abuse of the Case Stated procedure, the United Kingdom was estimated to be losing £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Abromson (1980) p.86&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[Lord Chancellor]] convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the ''status quo'' should remain.&lt;ref&gt;Abromson (1980) p.87&lt;/ref&gt; With the increased use of the Case Stated procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing.&lt;ref&gt;Hacking (2010) p.125&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the Case Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Smedresman (1979) p.324&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was endorsed by the government, and published the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr (1980) p.47&lt;/ref&gt; After being announced in the [[Queen's Speech]], the Arbitration Bill was introduced to the [[House of Lords]] by the Lord Chancellor in late 1978, given its second reading on 12 December 1978, and after passing through the committee stage, its third reading on 15 February 1979. Before it could be sent to the House of Commons, however, [[James Callaghan]]'s government collapsed following a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|motion of no confidence]]. As "the final drama", the Arbitration Bill quickly made it to the House of Commons and was passed during the few hours it took Callaghan to get to [[Buckingham Palace]] and ask for a dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;Hacking (2010) p.127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Assent]] was granted on 4 April 1979, and the Arbitration Act 1979 came into force on 1 August.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr (1980) p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Act==
The Act was "a compromise between two opposing jurisprudential approaches to arbitration...that the courts should be kept out of arbitration altogether except to prevent abuses against the rules of natural justice, [and] that the courts should retain a substantial measure of control over arbitrations to ensure that arbitral awards apply the law".&lt;ref&gt;Kerr (1980) p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 1===
[[File:Royal courts of justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[High Court of Justice]], the principal body that deals with arbitration appeals]]
The primary reforms are found in Section 1 of the Act. Section 1(1) repeals Section 21 of the 1950 Act, abolishing the Case Stated procedure in arbitration matters, and states that the courts cannot set aside a decision based on an error in law or fact that is blatantly obvious, effectively repealing Section 22(1).&lt;ref&gt;Smedresman (1979) p.326&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Sections 1(2) and 1(3) provide that an appeal may be made "on any question of law arising out of an award made on an arbitration agreement", if either the High Court agrees the appeal is valid, or if both parties to the arbitration request it.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr (1980) p.49&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Petraco (Bermuda) Ltd v Petromed International]]'',&lt;ref&gt;SA [1988] 3 All ER 484&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal was asked to explain what guidelines should be applied by a High Court judge when deciding whether or not to grant an appeal. The High Court had refused leave to appeal, because a point was raised which had not been mentioned during arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1989) p.415&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Staughton|Staughton LJ]], with the rest of the Court in agreement, explained that: {{quote|the judge should give such weight as he thinks fit to the failure to argue the point before the arbitrator. In particular, he should have regard to whether the new point is similar to points that were argued, perhaps a variant of one of those points or a different way of putting it on the one hand, or whether it is a totally new and different point on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1989) p.416&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The conditions for leave to appeal are laid out in Section 1(4). No conditions attach to an appeal where all parties consent, but when the permission of the High Court is sought, the judge may only grant leave if he "considers that...the question of law concerned could substantially affect the rights of one or more parties to the arbitration agreement". Under Sections 1(5) and 1(6), the High Court may ask for additional reasons as to why the arbitrator reached the decision that he did, but only if one of the parties gave notice to the arbitrator that reasons would be required, or there was "some special reason why such a notice was not given".&lt;ref name=smed327&gt;Smedresman (1979) p.327&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Universal Petroleum Co v Handels und Transport GmbH]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1987] 1 WLR 1178&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal interpreted the meaning of Sections 1(4) and 1(5). The dispute came from a highly detailed "Schedule of Further Reasons" ordered by the High Court because the judge felt that there was an ambiguous element in the reasons given.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1988) p.160&lt;/ref&gt; The appellate judges found that Section 1(5) required judges to order further reasons only to deal with points of law arising from the award. Material ambiguity was "inadmissible and irrelevant for the purpose of the exercise of any jurisdiction under section 1 of the Act".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1988) p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

If the High Court refuses to hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no decision may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Kolodziej (1987) p.206&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores &amp; Co (No.1)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1985] 1 WLR 1123&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court has decided not to allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1986) p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sections 2–6===
Section 21 of the 1950 Act contained a secondary method of appeal to the High Court. Through the "Consultative Case" procedure, parties in a pending arbitration could ask the High Court to quickly give a decision on a point of law.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr (1980) p.51&lt;/ref&gt; This provision was maintained in the 1979 Act, despite efforts by legislators to remove it.&lt;ref name=smed327/&gt; Section 2 provides that, should a party apply to the High Court with either the consent of the arbitrator or the other parties, the High Court may explain any point of law given in the reference, on the condition that the point of law meets the requirements laid out in Section 1, and if "the determination of the application might produce substantial savings in costs to the parties".&lt;ref&gt;Smedresman (1979) p.328&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Czarnikow v Roth, Schmidt &amp; Co]]'', the decision in which it was decided agreements excluding judicial supervision are invalid, is partially overruled by Sections 3 and 4. Section 3 provides that, where such an agreement is drafted, the High Court no longer has the automatic right to request additional reasons from the arbitrator or grant leave to appeal the decision. Such exclusion clauses must be specific, but can be general in nature; Section 3(2) states that it can be framed "to relate to a particular award, to awards under a particular reference or to any other description of awards, whether arising out of the same reference or not".&lt;ref&gt;Kolodziej (1987) p.209&lt;/ref&gt; Section 3(6) provides an exception, which covers "domestic" arbitration agreements; these are defined as agreements where leave to appeal would not be valid in a jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom, and no parties are businesses or individuals legally based in the UK. In this situation, the exclusion clause is only valid if agreed to after the start of arbitration. A second exception is found in Section 4(1); where the contract arbitration is based on is within admiralty jurisdiction, to do with commodities trading, or an insurance agreement, it will not be valid unless either it was entered into after the start of arbitration or the law applicable to the contract is not that of England and Wales. In any situation, the High Court can be asked to give a decision on a point of law, or the exclusion clause removed, should all parties agree.&lt;ref&gt;Kolodziej (1987) p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1979 Act, arbitrators were allowed to make [[interlocutory order]]s penalising parties who failed to follow the arbitrator's timetable or requests; there was, however, no effective enforcement mechanism. Section 5 of the Act allows the High Court to intervene; if a party fails to comply, the High Court may (on the application of the arbitrator or any other party) order the arbitrator to continue as if the offending party was not there; he can immediately issue an award without considering their missing submission or failure to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Shenton (1980) p.670&lt;/ref&gt; Section 6 amends the 1950 Act, which required any two arbitrators hearing a case to immediately appoint an umpire. This caused unnecessary delay and expenditure. Section 6 instead provides that arbitrators can choose to appoint an umpire at any point, but must do "forthwith" if they fundamentally disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Shenton (1980) p.671&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
David Shenton and Gordon Toland concluded that the Act brought judicial oversight in English law into compliance with that of other nations, saying that it is "broadly comparable to the provisions...to be found in Swedish, Swiss and French law".&lt;ref&gt;Shenton (1980) p.675&lt;/ref&gt; Smedresman, however, argued that it would do little to help attract new arbitration and would in fact drive it away, saying that "the vagueness of the statutory language, combined with the rather hazy policy considerations behind the Act, make confusion and litigation likely".&lt;ref&gt;Smedresman (1979) p.331&lt;/ref&gt; David Hacking, who helped promote the Act, says that it "was not drafted with the elegance of the 1996 Arbitration Act. In the style of the Parliamentary Draftsmen of that time, many of its provisions were drafted with a complexity which was happily avoided in the 1996 Act", and criticises the failure to achieve more than minor reform of existing law. However, he does note that the Act led to a shift in judicial policy, with future judgments to be issued with regards "to the need for finality...the striving for legal accuracy may be said to have been overtaken by commercial expediency".&lt;ref&gt;Hacking (2010) p.129&lt;/ref&gt; Jaffe agrees, writing in the journal ''Arbitration'' that "[i]t is clear that with the passage of the 1979 Act...there has been a distinct and noticeable shift of emphasis from [[legal certainty]] to finality for arbitral awards".&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe (1989) p.193&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is no longer in force, having been repealed in its entirety by Section 107(2) of the [[Arbitration Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=amending legislation- Section 107(2)1996 act|path=ukpga/1996/23/section/107}}&lt;br&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=amending legislation - Schedule 4 of the 1996 act|path=ukpga/1996/23/schedule/4}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4ST8-61R0-TWPY-Y150&amp;csi=274768&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true&amp;elb=t|title=Lexis@Library: Document (subscription needed)|publisher=LexisNexis|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13182">The '''British Colour Council''' (BCC) was an industry standards organisation, active from the 1930s to the 1950s, which produced indexes of named colours for use by government, industry, academia, and horticulture.

==1930s==
Founded in 1931 and chaired by designer Robert Francis Wilson, the BCC produced the '''British Colour Council reference Code''' or '''British Colour Codes''': indexes of named colours for a variety of industries.

==="Dictionary of Colour Standards"===
Its first major work was the British Colour Council 1934 "Dictionary of Colour Standards"&lt;ref&gt;British Colour Council. Dictionary of Colour Standards. London: British Colour Council (1934)&lt;br /&gt; 
British Colour Council. Dictionary of Colour Standards. London: British Colour Council  (2nd Edition 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; which defined colour shades in its printed plates and gave a two or three number code and evocative names to each colour. BCC colour codes define colours as varying by [[hue]], [[Lightness (color)|tone]] and [[Brightness|intensity]], and were originally designed for use in the [[textile]] [[dye]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Silverman. Studies in Industrial Organization, London (1945, 2003 reprint){{ISBN|0415313538}} p.89.
 &lt;br /&gt;[M. D. Law, F. C. Bartlett, George Newnes. Chambers's Encyclopaedia (1950), retrieved at [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm0oAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22British+Colour+Council%22&amp;dq=%22British+Colour+Council%22&amp;num=100&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1 Google books], p. 751.
&lt;/ref&gt; The colour names given by the BCC were particularly descriptive and often referred to flora or fauna, with titles such as Larkspur ("No. 196"), Forget-Me-Not ("No. 84"), Bee Eater Blue, Kermes, and Squirrel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colormatters.com/BBArchive/bubdarc7-meaning.html Color: The Magic and Mystery of Words], Color Matters (nd)&lt;br /&gt;Arthur O.

Taxon, Vol. 40, No. 2 (May, 1991), pp. 201-214&lt;/ref&gt;  The codes of the BCC became standards for identifying colours used in everything from the [[Royal Horticultural Society]], to British government planning commission maps,&lt;ref&gt;[http://faolex.fao.org/docs/texts/zam48558.doc Town and Country Planning (Development Plans) Regulations: Standard Town and Country Planning Colours]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 1963-79.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British Army]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miniatures.de/int/colour-british-standard.html British Standard Colour Table  British Vehicle Colours in World War Two] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021064829/http://miniatures.de/int/colour-british-standard.html |date=2007-10-21 }}, Military Miniatures Magazine (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], and the [[Royal Mail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papers-paints.co.uk/back1950Colours.htm Patrick Baty.

==="Dictionary of Colours for Interior Decoration"===
As the British Colour Council developed its services to industry it became apparent that the bias in the dictionary towards colours for textiles made it less relevant as a standard reference work for Interior Decoration. Some colours which were suitable for clothes were insufficiently permanent for application to carpets, curtains and upholstery fabric, while others were technically impracticable for use in the pottery and glass industries, in porcelain and vitreous enamel or in the making of paint or other materials used in decorating.

In 1949 the Council published the "Dictionary of Colours for Interior Decoration".  This work consisted of three volumes, two of colour samples and the other a slim list of names and a history of the colours. 

The 378 colours illustrated were shown on three surfaces – matt, gloss and a pile fabric (like carpet). One reference name and number was given for the colour shown in three forms, and it was stressed that the surface required should be made clear when the Dictionary was used to specify a colour match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patrickbaty.co.uk/2011/11/03/dictionary-of-colours-for-interior-decoration/ Dictionary of Colours for Interior Decoration.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horticulture===
In the late 1930s the BCC produced books for use in [[horticulture]]. Its first (1938) version included 200 named hues, printed as 3 lightnesses each for a total of 600 colours, each given distinctive names; later editions included 4 tints per hue, making a total of 800 colours.&lt;ref&gt;Horticultural Colour Chart, Volumes I and II, by Robert F. Wilson, 1938-41, issued by the British Colour Council in collaboration with the Royal Horticultural Society and published by Henry Stone and Son, Ltd., Banbury, England.&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.azaleas.org/index.pl/azcolorsystems.html Azalea Society of America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307092927/http://www.azaleas.org/index.pl/azcolorsystems.html |date=2008-03-07 }}, 2005.&lt;br /&gt;The Royal Horticultural Society and the Colour Council collaborated on a Horticultural Colour Chart, specifically designed to the colour range of cultivated plants. Printed from 1939 to 1941, it contained boxes of 200 sheets, with tints arranged four-to-a-page, and totalled 800 screen-printed colour patches.

==="British Colours"===
The BCC also advised the 1937 royal coronation, providing "Traditional British Colours" for flags and street decorations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patrickbaty.co.uk/2012/01/03/traditional-british-colours-coronation-of-king-george-vi/ British traditional colours souvenir in connection with the coronation of His Majesty King George VI and Her Majesty.

==Postwar==
The BCC, under the Chairmanship of British lighting industry executive Leslie Hubble,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptj.com.pk/Web%202004/02-2004/corporate_news.htm VERIVIDE 40th Anniversary Celebration], Pakistan Textiles Journal (nd)&lt;/ref&gt; continued to publish colour codes through the 1960s, and while largely supplanted by the [[British Standards]] organisation, and commercial colour standards such as [[Pantone]], the BCC codes are still referred to by industries in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.papers-paints.co.uk/colour_1950.asp Papers and Paints] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907084207/http://www.papers-paints.co.uk/colour_1950.asp |date=September 7, 2008 }} above, and [http://www.coloracademy.co.uk/ColorAcademy%202006/subjects/machines/machines.htm History of Colour in Machines], Colour Academy, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and used as standards for some [[British Commonwealth]] flags,&lt;ref&gt;see [[Flag of Barbados]], and [http://www.fotw.us/flags/za-ndf.html South Africa National Defense Force Flags] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420131322/http://www.fotw.us/flags/za-ndf.html |date=April 20, 2008 }}, Flags of the World.  The official colour of this flag was misnamed "Beetle Green", a misreading of the BCC's "Green Beetle".  Other Commonwealth flags using BCC standards include [http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/flags/aw.html Aruba] and [http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/flags/zm.html Zambia].&lt;/ref&gt; academic robes &lt;ref&gt;

'''Charles Carroll''' (March 22, 1723 &amp;ndash; March 23, 1783) was an American statesman from [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. He was the builder of the Baltimore Colonial home [[Mount Clare (Maryland)|Mount Clare]] (1760), and a delegate to the Second [[Continental Congress]] in 1776 and 1777.

== Early life ==
A descendant of the last Gaelic Lords of [[Éile]] in [[Ireland]], Charles Carroll was born in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] of a distinguished Roman Catholic [[Carroll family|family]] and was a distant cousin of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], (1737–1832), and [[Daniel Carroll]] (the First and Second), (1730–1796). His father, also Charles Carroll, took him to Europe in 1733 for his education. Young Charles spent six years at the English House school in [[Lisbon, Portugal]]. He then went to [[England]] to complete his education at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. After graduating Cambridge in 1746, Charles returned to Annapolis. He took up residence there. He busied himself learning to manage the family's farm and mills at Carrollton.

In 1751 Charles decided on a more specific career. He journeyed to [[London]], took up residence at the [[Middle Temple]], and studied law. He was admitted to the bar at the [[Inns of Court]] there before returning to Maryland early in 1755. Since there were now three other relatives named Charles active in public affairs in the area, he began to call himself  ''Charles Carroll, [[Barrister]]''. However, he never practiced law in the US.&lt;ref name=msa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/000200/000208/html/208bio.html|title=Charles Carroll, the barrister (1723&amp;ndash;1783)|work=Archives of Maryland|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months later his father died, leaving Charles, at 32, one of the wealthiest men in Maryland. He was elected to his father's seat for [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]] in the Maryland Assembly, legislature in Annapolis for the [[Province of Maryland|colony]]. 

In 1760 he completed construction of his summer home and estate at "Georgia Plantation", southwest of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] along the [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown Road]], also known as the Columbia Road (later Washington Boulevard, ([[U.S. Route 1]]) in modern [[Carroll Park]] and north of the [[Gwynns Falls]] stream which flows into the Middle Branch ("Ridgeley's Cove") and Ferry Branch of the [[Patapsco River]]. He named the home "[[Mount Clare Museum House|Mount Clare]]" after his grandmother. In June 1763 Charles married, to Margaret Tilghman (1742–1817), daughter of [[Matthew Tilghman]] of [[Talbot County, Maryland|Talbot County]]. Although the couple had no children who reached maturity, they remained together until his death. She became the mistress of Mount Clare, and earned a reputation for her greenhouse and pinery, where she grew oranges, lemons, and pineapple.

== Revolutionary years ==
Carroll continued in the Assembly until it was [[wikt:prorogue|prorogued]] at the beginning of the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], and then met with other leaders in the [[Annapolis Convention (1774–1776)|Annapolis Convention]] and had important roles in all their sessions. He joined the [[Committee of Correspondence]] in 1774, and the ''Committee of Safety'' in 1775. He presided over several sessions of the Convention, which was the early revolutionary government in Maryland. 

Charles was one of the committee of the convention that drafted the '' "Declaration and Charter of Rights and form of government for the state of Maryland"'' which served as Maryland's first new constitution after it was adopted on November 3, 1776. When the convention voted to expel the 23rd proprietary governor and last royal governor, [[Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland]], he delivered the message as the chairman of the Convention. Then, in an action typical of his style, he entertained the governor and his wife as house guests at Mount Clare Mansion until they sailed for England.

Later in November 1776, the Convention sent Carroll as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] to replace his cousin, [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]]. He served in that Congress until February 15, 1777. He declined the position of Chief Justice in the new revolutionary confederation government. But when he returned, he was elected to the first state Senate in 1777. Later he was re-elected and served in that office until his death, on March 23, 1783, at [[Mount Clare (Maryland)|Mount Clare Mansion]]. His funeral was held at [[St. Paul's Protestant Episcopal Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Old St. Paul's Anglican Church]] (now Episcopal since 1789) in Baltimore at North Charles and East Saratoga Streets.  He was buried there (small cemetery surrounding original church, later moved to block between West Baltimore and Lombard Streets-bounded by new Martin Luther King Boulevard) but later his body was moved to [[St. Anne's Church (Annapolis, Maryland)|St. Anne's Churchyard (Anglican/Episcopal)]] off Church Circle in Annapolis.

== Mount Clare and other ==
[[File:Mount Clare, Bayard &amp; South Monroe Streets, Carroll Park (Baltimore, Independent City, Maryland).jpg|thumb|170px|[[Mount Clare (Maryland)|Mount Clare]]]]
In the early 1760s, Carroll took the lead and encouraged a group of his business associates to build a fund for a young saddler, [[Charles Willson Peale]], so that he could go to Europe and study painting.

After Charles' death, his wife Margaret stayed at Mount Clare until her death there on March 14, 1817.  Mansion and grounds had many uses and owners during the later 19th Century.   Their home today is a museum, (both for its architecture, furniture and decorations plus history of the plantation and family) operated since 1917 by the National Society of the Colonial Dames in the State of Maryland, on behalf of the owner which is the City of Baltimore and its Department of Recreation and Parks. The core of the home is the refurbished main block. The wings, which had been lost over the years, were rebuilt in 1908. A great deal of the family furniture and possessions are preserved there. The home is a fine example of Georgian architecture, and stands on a rise in the center of [[Carroll Park, Baltimore|Carroll Park]] in southwest Baltimore City, surrounded by the neighborhoods of "[[Pigtown, Baltimore|Pigtown]]", also known by its more recent "gentrified" name of Washington Village. Mount Clare Museum House is open to the public year-round.

'''Compliance training''' refers to the process of educating employees on laws, regulations and company policies that apply to their day-to-day job responsibilities. An organization that engages in compliance training typically hopes to accomplish several goals: (1) avoiding and detecting violations by employees that could lead to legal liability for the organization; (2) creating a more hospitable and respectful workplace; (3) laying the groundwork for a partial or complete defense in the event that employee wrongdoing occurs despite the organization's training efforts; and (4) adding business value and a competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Business Case For Safety|url=https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/success_stories/compliance_assistance/abbott/abbott_casestudies/slide3.html|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations offer their employees compliance training on a wide range of topics, including workplace discrimination and harassment, dealings with competitors, [[insider trading]], protecting [[trade secret]]s, [[records management]], bribery and kickbacks, etc. Typically, most or all of these compliance topics are addressed in an organization's [[Code of Conduct]], and the organization may offer employees annual or bi-annual Code of Conduct training in lieu of requiring employees to take multiple individual training programs.

== History ==

"The history of how compliance regulations and mandates came about is not linear and completely clear, however most refer that it began around the Reagan scandals during his presidency. Moving ahead from that, it was the early 1990's after the Federal Sentencing Guidelines promised reduced fines for implementing an Effective Compliance and Ethics Program (ECEP). The last phase came from a number of high profile corporate corruption cases that include companies such as Enron, MCI/WorldCom, and Tyco."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thetruthaboutbusiness.blogspot.com/2010/10/history-and-emergence-of-ethics-and.html|title=History and Emergence of Ethics and Compliance|last=Joe|website=The Truth About Business|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Who is required to have compliance training? ==

Companies in all business sectors are under pressure to demonstrate that their employees are trained in laws and regulations, and internal policies, that pertain to their roles. Most notably, companies in the financial and healthcare sectors - who face stringent regulations - and publicly regulated companies have taken the lead by instituting firm-wide compliance training programs. For example, [[Walmart|WalMart]] would be required to train their employees on sexual harassment, data security, anti-harassment, and more.

For financial institutions, the key compliance training topics are [[Money laundering|anti money laundering]], [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]], and [[Insider trading|insider dealing]] ([[market abuse]] in the EU).

== Process ==

Compliance training can be performed in-house by compliance training specialists, or hired out to consultant firms. Some compliance training is done online.

=== Penalties for non-compliance ===
While this is entirely tied to the realm of compliance that is being considered, the penalties can range from a Fine, through the seizure of company assets, to jail time for executives of the company at fault. For example, the consequences of not being compliant with Anti Money Laundering cost the Las Vegas Sands Resort to pay $47 Million in penalties for suspicious credit card transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.markspaneth.com/insights/service/service/consequences-of-having-a-poor-anti-money-laundering-program|title=Consequences of Having a Poor Anti-Money Laundering Program - Marks Paneth|website=www.markspaneth.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIPAA fines for lack of compliance can be staggering as well. In the past, the Alaska State Department paid $1,700,000 in fines for an Unencrypted USB hard drive stolen, poor policies and risk analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.truevault.com/blog/what-is-the-penalty-for-a-hipaa-violation.html|title=What is the penalty for a HIPAA violation? - TrueVault|website=www.truevault.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4486">In [[marketing]] and [[microeconomics]], '''customer switching''' or '''consumer switching''' describes "[[customer]]s/[[consumer]]s abandoning a product or service in favor of a [[competitor]]".&lt;ref name=smallbusi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/concept-consumerswitching-behavior-65092.html|title=Concept of Consumer-Switching Behavior|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming constant [[price]], [[product quality|product]] or [[service quality]], counteracting this behaviour in order to achieve maximal [[customer retention]] is the business of marketing, [[public relations]] and [[advertising]]. '''Brand switching'''—as opposed to [[brand loyalty]] is the outcome of ''customer switching behaviour''.

==Reasons==
Variability in quality or market [[price fluctuation]]s—especially a rise in [[price]]s—may lead customers to consult [[price comparison]] services where alternative suppliers may be offered. Declining [[customer satisfaction]] may be due to poor service quality but also—to a lesser degree—be a symptom of boredom with the brand of choice.&lt;ref name=smallbusi/&gt; Brand loyalty can be very strong, however, and the longer a commitment to a brand lasts, the stronger the ties will usually be.

According to 2013 Nielsen study on [[customer loyalty]], brand switching can happen for 5 main reasons, but mainly based on price considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2013/the-price-is-right-incentives-that-stimulate-switching-behavior.html|title=The Price is Right: Incentives That Stimulate Switching Behavior|publisher=Nielsen|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall global averages are:
# Better Price (41%)
# Better Quality (26%)
# Better [[Service Agreement]] (15%)
# Better Selection (10%)
# Better Features (8%)

Because of the dominant role of pricing, market tactics like [[penetration pricing]] have evolved to offer a convincing incentive for switching. Along with these are the factors like service inconvenience, poor location, ethical issues like [[hard selling]] or unsafe products and also change in customers' income levels.  Another approach is the advertisement of [[vaporware]] that seemingly will offer newer or better features than established products without actually possessing any [[innovation]].

==Affected sectors==
Switching is a significant business factor affecting [[revenue]]s for companies providing ''continuously delivered services'', as is the case for the [[energy market]] as opposed to [[economic sector|sectors]] providing products that stimulate non- or sparsely recurring purchase because of the durability of the product or a general orientation towards casual customers.&lt;ref name=smallbusi/&gt; [[Energy customer switching]] is a significant risk or success factor for [[energy supplier]]s.

==Serial switching==
The term '''serial switcher''' was first coined by Charles Turner and David Alexander in their [[Customer relationship management]] course and then their CRM Pocketbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=PcM1WnOPuRsC&amp;dq=Charles+Turner+and+David+Alexander&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=16qTbxOmrE&amp;sig=WhaFVfDsJJQLG0k5opnFn2teXBc&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1 |title=CRM Pocketbook |publisher=Books.google.com |year=2001 |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes a person who continually moves his/her patronage from one company to another and highlights the ignorance of many organisations, including credit card companies, who strive for customer acquisition regardless of [[Customer retention|retention]] rates.

By offering a range of financial incentives, such as free [[balance transfer]]s or interest free periods, a company may hope to attract new customers. This is superficially attractive to companies if it meets acquisition and competitive switching targets.  In practice, however, a serial switcher will not contribute any profit if he/she does not stay long enough to provide a return on investments.  The lesson is that lack of integration and analysis across the business allows bad decisions to be made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12407">[[Image:Corntassel 7095.jpg|upright=0.80|right|thumb|The tassel of a corn plant]]'''Detasseling''' corn is removing the immature [[pollen]]-producing bodies, the tassel, from the tops of [[maize|corn (maize)]] plants and placing them on the ground. It is a form of pollination control,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ent.iastate.edu/pest/cornborer/commodities/seedcorn Seed corn] Iowa State University.  Retrieved October 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; employed to cross-breed, or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridize]], two varieties of corn.

Fields of corn that will be detasseled are planted with two varieties of corn. Every corn plant has both male and female parts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Plant and Soil Sciences eLibrary|url = http://passel.unl.edu/pages/informationmodule.php?idinformationmodule=1075412493&amp;topicorder=3&amp;maxto=12&amp;minto=1|website = passel.unl.edu|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; so if both varieties of corn were left intact, some of the resulting seeds would have non-hybrid parents. Removing the tassels from all the plants of one variety leaves the grain that is growing on those plants to be fertilized by the tassels of the other, resulting in a hybrid.

In addition to being more physically uniform, hybrid corn produces dramatically higher yields than corn produced by open pollination, as well as other desirable traits, such as disease, drought, and weather resistance. With modern seed corn the varieties to hybridize are carefully selected so that the new variety will exhibit specific traits found in both the parent plants. The detasseling process usually involves the use of both specialized machines and human labor.

==Machine detasseling==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Detasseling machine in field.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.30|A typical detasseling machine{{deletable image-caption|Saturday, 9 March 2013}}]] --&gt;
Nearly all detasseling is done in two steps; the field is first detasseled by machine and then detasseled manually. Machine detasseling itself is typically a two step process. Initially a detasseling machine called a "cutter" goes through the rows of corn to be detasseled and cuts off the top portion of the plant. This is done to make the field more uniform so that a "puller" machine can then come through the corn field when the tassels have started to emerge past the cut leaves and pull the tassel out of the plant. It typically takes 24 to 48 hours to have the tips of the tassels emerge enough to get a good pull without grabbing the leaves of the plant after the initial cut. The pullers work by catching the top of the tassel between two rollers moving at a high speed. This removes the majority of the tassels.

Detasseling machines typically remove 30 to 90 percent of the tassels in a seed corn field. This is far less than the 99.7 percent that need to be removed to produce the uniformity of seed desired by farmers. The main problems for the machines are that they are unable to adapt quickly to height differences in plants and they throw tassels into the air where they can become lodged in other corn plants and inadvertently allow pollination.  It is desirable that the pulled tassel ends up on the ground to prevent this problem.

==Manual detasseling==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Detasseler carrier in seed corn field.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.30|A typical detasseler carrier; these specialized tractors are used when detasseling on foot is impractical.{{deletable image-caption|Saturday, 9 March 2013}}]] --&gt;
Whether or not a field of seed corn is initially detasseled by machines, eventually people are employed to detassel the plants that the machines missed and to remove any tassels that the machines left in the leaves of other corn plants. This is done either by having "detasselers" walk through the corn field removing the tassels or by having detasselers ride through the corn field on a detasseler carrier. Detasseler carriers are typically employed when the corn is too tall to be detasseled from ground level. Each carrier can hold from eight to twelve detasselers.

Detasseling work is usually performed by teens; as such, it serves as a typical [[rite of passage]] in rural areas of the [[Corn Belt]] of the [[Midwestern United States]]. {{Harvard citation|Byron|2002|pp=}}{{Harvard citation|Gustafson|2003|pp=}} For many teens in these areas it is their first job. Exact starting dates depend on the specific area of the country and the growing conditions of any given year. The detasseling "season" typically lasts from two to four weeks with work days varying from just a few hours to over 10 hours depending on the growing season. Wages for detasselers vary greatly; some detasselers earn minimum wage while others earn over $12.00 per hour. Individual wages depend on the seed corn company, the detasseling contractor, the experience of the detasseler and even the individual field conditions such as the number of plants per acre, percentage of the tassels pulled by a detasseling machine or the height of the corn.

The manner by which wages are determined can also vary greatly between detasseling contractors. Some pay a straight hourly wage, others pay on a [[piece rates]] basis where detasselers are paid an amount for every row, panel or acre detasseled. Other contractors use a rating system to determine detasseler wages for a given day.

In addition to employing a large teenage workforce, some areas of the country employ migrant workers as detasselers. Migrant workers wages are usually paid on a piece rates basis. During the 1980s in some areas of the U.S. detasseling work shifted from being primarily local teenagers to primarily migrant farm workers.

==History==

===Early 20th century===
Detasseling was used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the "ear-row" method of corn breeding. In this method alternating rows of corn are detasseled and the seed from the detasseled rows is saved for planting the following season. However, ear-row breeding did not result in large yield increases and was largely abandoned after a few years. {{Harvard citation|Wallace|1925|pp=223}}

Around 1910 experimental corn breeders became excited by the possibility of improving corn yields by crossing two high yielding varieties. Again, this was accomplished by planting the varieties in alternating rows and detasseling one of the varieties. This method of seed production also proved disappointing and was also abandoned. {{Harvard citation|Wallace|1925|pp=224}}

However, the modern hybridization process, where one inbred line of corn is crossed with another, developed from this early work in cross breeding. In 1908, [[George Harrison Shull]] described [[heterosis]], also known as hybrid vigor. Heterosis describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. In 1917 a process was developed that would make this hybridization commercially viable. In 1933 less than 1% of the corn produced in the United States was produced from hybrid seed; by 1944 over 83% was. {{Harvard citation|Copeland|1995|pp=236}} This hybrid seed is produced by crossing two inbred lines by planting a row of one inbred variety followed by several rows of a second variety. The tassels of the second variety were removed by hand so that the second variety could be pollinated by the first.

===Late 20th century===
Hybrid corn was detassled manually until the mid-1950s when a [[Cytoplasmic male sterility|cytoplasm]] was discovered that would cause one of the inbred lines to be male sterile while the hybridized seed corn it produced would regain male fertility. This gene allowed seed corn companies to greatly reduce their labor costs by producing seed corn without the need for manual detasseling. By the mid-1960s nearly all seed corn was produced with this gene. {{Harvard citation|Basra|1999|pp=52}}

This situation changed in 1971 with an outbreak of the fungus southern corn leaf blight. The cytoplasm used to produce male sterility was highly susceptible to this fungus. At the time approximately 90% of hybrid corn used in the United States contained this gene. {{Harvard citation|Smith|2004|pp=601}} About 15% of the corn crop was lost to infection and for the next few years male sterility was abandoned and nearly all seed corn was again detasseled manually.  {{Harvard citation|Copeland|1995|pp=238}}

In the mid-1970s machines were developed to help reduce the large labor costs associated with manual detasseling and as a response to a shrinking rural teen labor force. In the 1980s male sterile varieties were reintroduced that were not susceptible to southern corn leaf blight, however the reliance on a single sterile variety seen in the 1960s has not been repeated. {{Harvard citation|Basra|1999|pp=51–52}}

Today corn hybridization is accomplished by a combination of machine and manual detasseling as well as male-sterile genes.

==Seed corn fields==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Seed corn field after germination.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Seed corn field a few weeks after germination planted in a 4:1 pattern{{deletable image-caption|Saturday, 9 March 2013}}]] --&gt;
Seed corn fields are planted in a repetitive pattern known as a "panel", "block", "frame", "bay" or "set" depending on the area of the country. There are two main planting patterns for these panels. A panel may be planted in a 6:2 pattern where six "female" rows, the rows to be detasseled, are followed by two "male" or "bull" rows, the rows that will be used to pollinate the detasseled rows. Panels are also commonly planted in a 4:1 ratio with four female rows followed by a single male row. Other, less common, patterns are also used including 4:2 and 4:1:6:1. In all cases the pattern is continued throughout the corn field. {{Harvard citation|Smith|2004|pp=584}}

All or portions of seed corn fields may be surrounded by extra rows of male plants if it is likely that wind may carry foreign pollen into the seed corn field. These extra rows are called "buffer" or "isolation" rows depending on the area of the country. Another important aspect to keeping undesirable pollen out of seed corn fields is a process known as [[roguing]], a process that removes plants that differ from the variety intentionally planted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6602">'''Diane Hamilton''' was the pseudonym of '''Diane Guggenheim''' (1924–1991), an American mining heiress, [[folksong]] patron and founder of "[[Tradition Records]]".

==Personal life==
The only child of millionaire [[Harry Frank Guggenheim]], president of ''[[Newsday]]'' and onetime U. S. ambassador to Cuba, and his second wife, Caroline Morton (formerly Mrs William Chapman Potter), Hamilton was born as Diana Guggenheim in New York City, New York. She had two half-sisters, Joan (born 1913) and Nancy (1915–1972), from her father's first marriage to Helen Rosenberg.

Her maternal grandfather was [[Paul Morton]], U. S. Secretary of the Navy, while her maternal great-grandfather was [[Julius Sterling Morton]], U. S. Secretary of Agriculture.

She was married and divorced four times:
*Lieutenant [[John Langstaff|John Meredith Langstaff]], a U. S. Army officer and aspiring concert singer, married 1943. They had one child, Diane Carol Langstaff (Mrs Peter Duveneck, Mrs Jim Rooney).
*Robert Guillard.
*William Meek, an Irish journalist, whom she married in 1963. They had four children: Eoin Meek, Colm Meek, Sorcha Meek, and Caitriona Meek.
*John Darby Stolt, aka John Hamilton-Darby

==Career==
Very little is known of Hamilton's life, and only since the publication of the book ''The Mountain of the Women: Memoirs of an Irish Troubadour'' by [[Liam Clancy]]&lt;ref name="LClancy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clancy|first= Liam |year=2002|title= The Mountain of the Women: Memoirs of an Irish Troubadour|location=Ireland|publisher= Dubleday|isbn= 0-385-52050-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has it been possible to reconstruct her most notable years. In order to disguise her wealth, she adopted the alias 'Diane Hamilton'.

She lived in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] in the late 1950s where she ran a [[Montessori]] school and frequented workshops led by [[Roberto Assagioli|Dr. Roberto Assagioli]].

In 1955 she traveled to [[Ireland]] in search of [[Irish folk music|folk singers]]. According to Liam Clancy's book, she became acquainted with Tom and Paddy Clancy in New York, and while in Ireland made the Clancy household one of the stops on her collecting trip. Young Liam was invited to continue on the trip with her, and one of the next stops was the home of [[Sarah Makem]] who had previously been recorded by [[Jean Ritchie]] on her album ''Field Trip'' (1954). This fateful meeting brought together Liam and Sarah's younger son, [[Tommy Makem]], who was also recorded.  These two, along with Liam's older brothers Paddy and Tom Clancy, would eventually form "[[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]]", one of the most successful groups in Irish music history.

The anthology Hamilton recorded in 1955 as ''[[The Lark in the Morning (album)|The Lark in the Morning]]'' is the earliest album-length collection of Irish folk songs sung by Irish singers to be recorded in Ireland. Also on the album are [[Paddy Tunney]] and [[Tommy Makem]], son of Sarah Makem. This album was re-released in a restored format in the late 1990s on the [[Rykodisc]] label.

==Tradition Records==
Another member of the Clancy family, [[Patrick Clancy|Paddy Clancy]], helped Hamilton run [[Tradition Records]] as the company's president. ''The Lark in the Morning'' was the first album released on the Tradition label in 1955. Subsequent releases included ''[[The Rising of the Moon (album)|The Rising of the Moon]]'' by [[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]], and ''The Countess Cathleen'' by [[W.B. Yeats]] in 1956. Other notable recordings include ''Negro Prison songs'', a compilation by [[Alan Lomax]] and ''The Bonny Bunch of Roses'' with [[Seamus Ennis]]. Other Tradition artists included [[Ed McCurdy]], [[Odetta]], [[Paul Clayton (folksinger)|Paul Clayton]], [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] and [[Etta Baker]]. In 1959 the label released ''John Langstaff Sings American and English Ballads'', featuring her then-current husband singing and Nancy Trowbridge (who later became Langstaff's second wife) on piano. The album was re-released by Revels Records in 2002 as ''The Water Is Wide: American and British Ballads and Folksongs''. Once the Clancy Brothers signed with Columbia Records in 1961, the catalogue was sold, possibly to Transatlantic.

In the 1970s, Hamilton was involved in the founding of the Mulligan record label, in Dublin. She may have regarded [[Dónal Lunny]] as the successor to Liam Clancy as the next standard-bearer of the authentic Irish traditional music heritage.

A passing reference to Hamilton in a California folk music magazine suggests that she was still active in Irish music as late as the early 1980s. The November/December 1982 issue of ''Folk Scene'' (Los Angeles) credits her with "the lion's share of the work" for the recording, in 1977, of the album ''[[Andy Irvine (musician)#The Gathering|The Gathering]]''&amp;mdash;released on the label Greenhays in 1981&amp;mdash;which features the playing of [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]], [[Paul Brady]], [[Dónal Lunny]], [[Matt Molloy]], [[Tommy Potts]], [[Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill]] and uilleann piper Peter Browne.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk Scene,'' Los Angeles, CA, November–December 1982, Vol. 10, #5, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francisco Hernandez Giron 2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Francisco Hernández Girón]] was a Spanish ''encomendero'' in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] who protested the [[New Laws]] in 1553. These laws, passed in 1542, gave certain rights to indigenous peoples and protected them against abuses. Drawing by [[Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala]].]]
{{Slavery|Region}}
'''''Encomienda''''' ({{IPA-es|eŋkoˈmjenda}}) was a Spanish labor system. It rewarded  conquerors with the labor of particular groups of subject people. It was first established in Spain during the Roman period, but used also following the Christian conquest of Muslim territories. It was applied on a much larger scale during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and the [[Philippines]]. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the [[Spanish monarch]]. The Crown awarded an ''encomienda'' as a grant to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the sixteenth century, the grants were considered to be a monopoly on the labor of particular groups of Indians ([[indigenous peoples]]), held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the ''encomendero'', and his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encomiendas were a form of "communal" slavery. In the ''encomienda'', the Spanish Crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community, but did not dictate which individuals in the community would have to provide their labor. Indigenous leaders were charged with mobilizing the assessed tribute and labor. In turn, ''encomenderos'' were to ensure that the encomienda natives were given instruction in the Christian faith and Spanish language, and protect them from warring tribes or pirates; they had to suppress rebellion against Spaniards, and maintain infrastructure. In return, the natives would provide tributes in the form of metals, maize, wheat, pork, or other agricultural products.

With the ouster of [[Christopher Columbus]], the Spanish crown sent a royal governor, Fray [[Nicolás de Ovando]], who established the formal ''encomienda'' system.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases natives were forced to do hard labor and subjected to extreme punishment and death if they resisted.&lt;ref name="encslav"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion|page=184|volume=1|first=Junius P.|last=Rodriguez|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33272-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_kuS42BxIYC&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Castile forbade Indian slavery and deemed the indigenous to be "free vassals of the crown".&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, 143&lt;/ref&gt; Various versions of the ''Leyes de Indias'' or [[Laws of the Indies]] from 1512 onwards attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives. Both natives and Spaniards appealed to the [[Real Audiencia]]s for relief under the ''encomienda'' system.

''Encomiendas'' had often been characterized by the geographical displacement of the enslaved and breakup of communities and family units, but in Mexico, the ''encomienda'' ruled the free vassals of the crown through existing community hierarchies, and the natives were allowed to keep in touch with their families and homes.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule,'' Stanford, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The heart of ''encomienda'' and ''encomendero'' lies in the Spanish verb ''encomendar'', "to entrust". The ''encomienda'' was based on the ''[[reconquista]]'' institution in which ''[[adelantado]]s'' were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other [[peasant]]s in areas that they had conquered and resettled.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
The ''encomienda'' system traveled to America as the result of the implantation of Castilian law over the territory. The system was created in the Middle Ages and was pivotal to allow for the repopulation and protection of frontier land during the [[reconquista]]. The encomienda established a relationship similar to a feudal relationship, in which military protection was traded for certain tributes or by specific work. It was especially prevalent among military orders that were entrusted with the protection of frontier areas. The king usually intervened directly or indirectly in the bond, by guaranteeing the fairness of the agreement and intervening militarily in case of abuse.

The ''encomienda'' system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution. The ''encomenderos'' did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the ''encomendero''; Indian lands were to remain in the possession of their communities. This right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the [[New World]] belonged to this crown and not to the [[Catholic monarchs]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Meredith, "[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html The Encomienda System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218180735/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html |date=2005-12-18 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Encomenderos''==
[[File:Hernán_Cortés_(Meister_von_Saldana).gif|thumb|right|[[Hernán Cortés]], conqueror of the Aztecs and premier encomendero of [[New Spain]]]]
The first grantees of the ''encomienda'' or ''encomenderos'' were usually conquerors who received these grants of labor by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving ''encomiendas'' in [[New Spain]] (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.

In his study of the ''encomenderos'' of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of [[Hernán Cortés]]' original expedition, calling them "first conquerors", and those who were members of the later [[Pánfilo de Narváez|Narváez]] expedition, calling them "conquerors". The latter  were incorporated into Cortes' contingent. Himmerick designated as ''pobladores antiguos'' (old settlers), a group of undetermined number of ''encomenderos'' in New Spain, men who had resided in the Caribbean region prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico.

Holders of ''encomiendas'' also included women and indigenous elite. Doña Maria Jaramillo, the daughter of [[La Malinche|Doña Marina]] and conqueror Juan Jaramillo, received income from her deceased father's ''encomiendas''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555'', Austin: University of Texas Press, 1991 p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Moctezuma's daughters, Doña [[Isabel Moctezuma]] and her younger sister, Doña Leonor Moctezuma, were granted extensive ''encomiendas'' in perpetuity by Hernan Cortes. Doña Leonor Moctezuma married in succession two Spaniards, and left the ''encomiendas'' to her daughter by her second husband.&lt;ref&gt;Himmerich y Valencia (1991), ''The Encomenderos'', pp. 195-96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samora |first=Julian |author2=Patricia Vandel Simon |title=A History of the Mexican-American People |url=http://www.jsri.msu.edu/museum/pubs/MexAmHist/chapter3.html#five |accessdate=2009-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402165741/http://www.jsri.msu.edu/museum/pubs/MexAmHist/chapter3.html |archivedate=April 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Himmerich y Valencia (1991), 27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vassal]] Inca rulers appointed after the conquest also sought and were granted ''encomiendas''.

The status of humans as [[Ward (law)|wards]] of the trustees under the ''encomienda'' system served to "define the status of the Indian population": the natives were free men, not slaves or serfs.{{cn|date=November 2018}} But some Spaniards treated them as poorly as slaves.

The ''encomienda'' was essential to the Spanish crown's sustaining its control over North, Central and South America in the first decades after the colonization. It was the first major organizational law instituted on the continent, which was affected by war, widespread disease epidemics caused by Eurasian diseases, and resulting turmoil. The settler-conquistadors were confronted by the fury of the aroused Indian lords; voyagers, explorers, and the friars did not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Inga Clendinnen|Clendinnen, Inga]]; ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatán, 1517–1570''. (p. 83) {{ISBN|0-521-37981-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the ''encomienda'' system was devised to meet the needs of the early agricultural economies in the Caribbean. Later it was adopted to the mining economy of [[Peru]] and [[Upper Peru]]. The ''encomienda'' lasted from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9032596|title= Encomienda|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online|date= 26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip II, enacted a law on 11 June 1594 to establish the ''encomienda'' in the [[Philippines]], where he made grants to the local nobles (''[[principalía]]''). They used the ''encomienda'' to gain ownership of large expanses of land, many of which (such as [[Makati]]) continue to be owned by affluent families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Dr. Eric A|title=The encomienda in early Philippine colonial history|year=1976|publisher=Journal of Asian Studies|location=Quezon City|pages=27–32|url=http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-14-2-1976/anderson-encomienda-philippine-history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishment ==
In 1501 [[Isabella of Castile|Queen Isabella]] declared Native Americans as subjects to the crown, and so, as Castilians and legal equals to Spanish Castilians. This implied that enslaving them was illegal except on very specific conditions. It also allowed the establishment of encomiendas, since the encomienda bond was a right reserved to full subjects to the crown.
In 1503, the crown began to formally grant ''encomiendas'' to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of ''encomiendas'' was aided by the crown's organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as ''[[Indian Reductions|reducciones]]'', with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.

Each ''reducción'' had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the laborers in his community. The ''encomienda'' system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers' acquisition of land. As initially defined, the ''encomendero'' and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major crown reform in 1542, known as the [[New Laws]], encomendero families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, Spanish recipients rebelled against the crown, killing the viceroy, Don [[Blasco Núñez Vela]].

In Mexico, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] decided against implementing the reform, citing local circumstances and the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, "I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Aiton, ''Antonio de Mendoza, First Viceroy of New Spain,'' Durham: Duke University Press 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''encomienda'' system was ended legally in 1720, when the crown attempted to abolish the institution. The ''encomenderos'' were then required to pay remaining ''encomienda'' laborers for their work.

The ''encomiendas'' became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepción, north of Santo Domingo, the ''[[adelantado]]'' of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=15%2C000&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing this, the Adelantado captured the ''[[cacique]]s'' involved and had most of them hanged.

Later, a chieftain named [[Guarionex]] laid havoc to the countryside before an Indian-Spanish army of about 3,090 routed the [[Ciguana people]] under his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=three%20thousand%20islanders&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders &lt;!-- where are we?

As noted, the change of requiring the ''encomendado'' to be returned to the crown after two generations was frequently overlooked, as the colonists did not want to give up the labor or power. The ''Codice Osuna'', one of many colonial-era [[Aztec codices]] (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in [[Nahuatl]], there is evidence that the indigenous were well aware of the distinction between indigenous communities held by individual encomenderos and those held by the crown.&lt;ref&gt;''Codice Osuna,'' Ediciones del Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, Mexico 1947, pp. 250-254&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574, the Viceroy of Peru [[Diego López de Zúñiga, 4th Count of Nieva|Diego Lopez de Velasco]] investigated the ''encomiendas''. He concluded there were 32,000 Spanish families in the New World, 4,000 of whom had ''encomiendas''. They oversaw 1,500,000 natives paying tribute, and 5 million "civilized" natives.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, John A. ''The Epic of Latin America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "''sin indios no hay Indias''" (without Indians, there are no Indies – i.e. America), popular in Spanish America especially in the 16th century, emphasizes the economic importance and appeal of this [[indentured labor]]. It was ranked higher than allocations of precious metals or other natural resources. Land awardees customarily complained about how "worthless" territory was without a population of ''encomendados''.

===Encomienda and epidemics===

The native people of Mexico experienced a series of outbreaks of disease in the wake of European conquest, including a catastrophic epidemic that began in 1545 which killed an estimated 5 million to 15 million people, or up to 80% of the native population of Mexico, followed by a second epidemic from 1576 to 1578 killing an additional 2 to 2.5 million people, or about 50% of the remaining native population. Recent research suggests that these infections appear to have been aggravated by the extreme climatic conditions of the time and by the poor living conditions and harsh treatment of the native people under the encomienda system of New Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Acuna-Soto, David W. Stahle, Malcolm K. Cleaveland,  and Matthew D. Therrell (April 2002). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730237/ "Megadrought and Megadeath in 16th Century Mexico"], ''Emerg Infect Dis.'', 8(4), pp. 360–362. doi:  10.3201/eid0804.010175. Retrieved 16 Jan. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethnocide====
[[Raphael Lemkin]] (coiner of the term [[genocide]]) considers Spain's abuses of the [[Amerindian|Native]] population of the Americas to constitute cultural and even outright [[genocide]] including the abuses of the Encomienda system. He described slavery as "cultural genocide par excellence" noting "it is the most effective and thorough method of destroying culture, of desocializing human beings." He considers colonist guilty due to failing to halt the abuses of the system despite royal orders. He also notes the [[genocidal rape|sexual abuse]] of Spanish colonizers of Native women as acts of "biological [[genocide]]."&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Lemkin's History of Genocide and Colonialism&lt;br&gt;
Holocaust Memorial Museum https://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/speakers-and-events/all-speakers-and-events/raphael-lemkin-history-of-genocide-and-colonialism&lt;/ref&gt; Yale University's [[genocide studies]] program supports this view, citing the decline of the [[Taíno]] population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1492 to 1514 as an example noting their population declined from 1,000,000 to 100,000 to only 32,000 a decline of 68% to over 96%.&lt;ref&gt;Hispaniola Case Study: Colonial Genocides&lt;br&gt;Date range of image:1492 to 1514 https://gsp.yale.edu/case-studies/colonial-genocides-project/hispaniola&lt;/ref&gt; Those numbers are largely based on the accounts of Las Casas and the letters that  wrote during the epidemics. [[Darcy Ribeiro]] considers that native exploitation was the fuel of the productivity of the Spanish Colonies and, [[H. F. Dobyns]] estimated 95%.

Since 1960 several Hispanists and anthropologists, like [[Julian Juderias]] or [[Cook y Borah]] have challenged both the numbers and the causes offered by Raphael Lemkin. [[Frequency distribution of the main mtDNA American haplogroups in Native American populations|Recent genetic studies]] Their genetic testing of the present-day American native population showed that a 96% decline did not occur, based on the remaining genetic diversity of the native populace tested.&lt;ref&gt;Various Authors. A global analysis of Y-chromosomal haplotype diversity for 23 STR loci. Forensic Science International: Genetics Volume 12, September 2014, Pages 12-23&lt;/ref&gt; Their study allowed for a maximum possible decline of 25% in the population based on their findings. Brendan D. O'Fallona and Lars Fehren-Schmitz separately estimated a historic native mortality of about 50% loss with a quick recovery and little loss in diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan D. O'Fallona and Lars Fehren-Schmitz. ''Native Americans experienced a strong population bottleneck coincident with European contact.'' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Dec 20; 108(51): 20444–20448. Published online 2011 Dec 5. doi:  10.1073/pnas.1112563108 {{PMC|3251087}} {{PMID|22143784}} Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt; Quentin D Atkinson Cook and Borah [[Universidad de California en Berkeley]] conducted a decade long study on the historical native demographics of Mexico and estimated that the overall decrease in native population was only 3%.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. F. y W. W. Borah (1963), The Indian population of Central Mexico, Berkeley (Cal.), University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenblat estimates a lower number for Mexico and Colombia. Acuna-Soto R1, Romero LC, and Maguire JH suggested the rate of mortality from disease in native American populations at around 45%.&lt;ref&gt;Acuna-Soto R1, Romero LC, Maguire JH. Large epidemics of hemorrhagic fevers in Mexico 1545-1815.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the specific number, it is widely agreed that the peak in mortality started in 1545 and peaked some years later after the New Laws were put in place, the encomienda system was abolished, and women, and more importantly children, were allowed to migrate. What mortality of the native population did occur was mainly attributable to disease. Most scholars agree that the main culprits were European infantile diseases like smallpox, measles, and chicken pox.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Guerra. Origen de las epidemias en la conquista de América&lt;/ref&gt; Elsa Malvido suggests that the plague caused the hemorrhagic fevers described by the Spanish physicians, while a recent, controversial study recently proposed by microbiologist [[Rodolfo Acuna-Soto]] suggests that the diseases that decimated the population were actually a native hemorrhagic plague carried by rats.&lt;ref&gt;RODOLFO ACUNA-SOTO, LETICIA CALDERON ROMERO, AND JAMES H. MAGUIRE LARGE EPIDEMICS OF HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS IN MEXICO 1545–1815. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 62(6), 2000, pp. 733–739&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==
===Previously===
The ''encomienda'' system was the subject of controversy in Spain and its territories almost from its start. In 1510, an [[Hispaniola]] ''encomendero'' named Valenzuela murdered a group of Native American leaders who had agreed to meet for peace talks in full confidence. The Taíno Cacique [[Enriquillo]] rebelled against the Spaniards between 1519 and 1533. In 1538, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], realizing the seriousness of the Taíno revolt, changed the laws governing the treatment of Indians laboring in the encomiendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Columbus and Las Casas: the conquest and Christianization of America, 1492–1566 | author=David M. Traboulay | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Jmi4Wb1DdsC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=enriquillo+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=S08sTP7LHMXflgeajv2hCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=enriquillo%20revolt&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceding to Las Casas's viewpoint, the peace treaty between the Taínos and the ''[[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|audiencia]]'' was eventually disrupted in four to five years. The crown also made two failed attempts to end the abuses of the ''encomienda'' system, through the Law of Burgos (1512–13) and the [[New Laws|New Law of the Indies (1542)]]. Furthermore, these laws were indeed beneficial to the authorities.

The priest of Hispaniola and former ''encomendero'' [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] underwent a profound conversion after seeing the abuse of the native people.&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé de Las Casas, who arrived in the New World in 1502, averred that greed was the reason Christians “murdered on such a vast scale,” killing “anyone and everyone who has shown the slightest sign of resistance,” and subjecting “all males to the harshest and most iniquitous and brutal slavery that man has ever devised for oppressing his fellow-men, treating them, in fact, worse than animals.” Reséndez, Andrés. The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America (Kindle Locations 338-341). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He dedicated his life to writing and lobbying to abolish the ''encomienda'' system, which he thought systematically enslaved the native people of the New World. Las Casas participated in an [[Valladolid debate|important debate]], where he pushed for the enactment of the New Laws and an end to the ''encomienda'' system.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Keen, ''Bartolome de las Casas in history: toward an understanding of the man and his work''. (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University, 1971), 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt; The Laws of Burgos and the New Laws of the Indies failed in the face of colonial opposition and, in fact, the New Laws were postponed in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. When [[Blasco Núñez Vela]], the first viceroy of Peru, tried to enforce the New Laws, which provided for the gradual abolition of the ''encomienda'', many of the ''encomenderos'' were unwilling to comply with them and revolted against him.

===The New Laws of 1542===
{{Main|New Laws}}

When the news of this situation and of the abuse of the institution reached Spain, the [[New Laws]] were passed to regulate and gradually abolish the system in America, as well as to reiterate the prohibition of enslaving Native Americans. By the time the new laws were passed, 1543, the Spanish crown had acknowledged their inability to control and properly ensure compliance of traditional laws overseas, so they granted to Native Americans specific protections not even Spaniards had, such as the prohibition of enslaving them even in the case of crime or war. This extra protections were an attempt to avoid the proliferation of irregular claims to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez Romero. LA SITUACIÓN JURÍDICA DEL INDIO DURANTE LA CONQUISTA ESPAÑOLA EN AMÉRICA. REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE DERECHO DE MÉXICO TOMO LXVIII, Núm.270 (Enero-Abril 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repartimiento==
Nevertheless, the ''encomienda'' system was generally replaced by the crown-managed ''[[repartimiento]]'' system throughout Spanish America after mid-century.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Like the ''encomienda'', the new ''repartimento'' did not include the attribution of land to anyone, rather only the allotment of native workers. But they were directly allotted to the crown, who, through a local crown official, would assign them to work for settlers for a set period of time, usually several weeks. The ''repartimiento'' was an attempt "to reduce the abuses of forced labour".&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; As the number of [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives declined]] and mining activities were replaced by agricultural activities in the seventeenth century, the [[hacienda]], or large landed estates in which laborers were directly employed by the hacienda owners (''hacendados''), arose because land ownership became more profitable than acquisition of forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;Tindall, George Brown &amp; David E. Shi (1984). ''America: A Narrative History'' (Sixth ed.). W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''encomienda'' was strongly based on the ''encomendado''{{'}}s tribal identity. Mixed-race ([[Mestizo]]) individuals, for example, could not by law be subjected to the ''encomienda''. This moved many Amerindians to deliberately seek to dilute their tribal identity and that of their descendants as a way for them to escape the service, by seeking intermarriage with people from different [[ethnic group|ethnicities]], especially Spaniards or Creoles. In this way the ''encomienda'' somewhat weakened Amerindians' tribal identification and ethnicity, which in turn diminished the pool of available ''encomendados''.

'''Sir Ernest Hyam Davis''' (17 February 1872 – 16 September 1962) was a New Zealand businessman, and was [[Mayor of Auckland City]] from 1935 to 1941. He was also on other Auckland local bodies (Fire Board, Hospital Board, Drainage Board) and on various philanthropic and sporting organisations. He was Mayor of [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]] (a small inner-Auckland borough) 1909–1910.

==Early life==
He was born in Nelson, and attended Bishops School Nelson and [[Auckland Grammar School]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1951|p=60}} On 2 August 1899, he married [[Marion Mitchell]], who had made a career as an opera singer with her debut at age 14.&lt;ref name="DNZB Mitchell"&gt;{{DNZB|Downes| Peter|2m51|Marion Mitchell|1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
He was in the brewing industry; W Macarthur &amp; Co, and later became managing director of Hancock &amp; Co. In 1923 [[New Zealand Breweries]] was formed. He was a brewery baron for half a century and a master tactician against the Prohibition movement. His brother [[Eliot Davis]] was also in the brewing company.

During the 1912 [[Waihi miners' strike]] the strike leaders were imprisoned, but were released in November for securities of £1600; the bond was later found to have been put up by Davis. He was a major source of funds for the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] for half a century.{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=62}} He was the employer of [[Michael Joseph Savage]] for most of the period 1908–1919.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=279}} He also employed [[John A. Lee]] to manage the Palace Hotel in Rotorua from 1929 to 1931 after the latter lost his seat in Parliament.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A millionaire who from 1912 until his death was a very generous financial supporter of the Labour Party ... A ruthless businessman, benefactor of worthy causes, and with an eye for the opposite sex.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=279}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davis told [[Warren Freer]], then the Labour candidate for {{NZ electorate link|Mount Albert}} in the  [[Mount Albert by-election, 1947|1947]] by-election that ''he was not opposed to state control of liquor outlets, but was opposed to state control of breweries'' and supported Labour (sending a substantial cheque for party campaign funds) because ''the Labour Party policy allows a worker to have a few shillings in his pocket and without that he cannot buy my beer. Conservatives tend to look after the more affluent in the country and do not care if the worker has sixpence for a beer or not''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= [[Warren Freer|Freer]] |first= Warren W |title= A Lifetime in Politics: the memoirs of Warren Freer  |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 2004 |publisher= [[Victoria University Press]] |location= Wellington |isbn= 0-86473-478-6 |oclc= |page= 26 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was the owner of the [[Grand Hotel Auckland]] from the death of his father Moss Davis in 1910 until 1962 when he died himself. He had collected a large amount of Victorian paintings, which hung in the hotel until its closure in 1966 when leased by Hancock &amp; Co. Ltd from the Ara Masonic Lodge. He was also a racehorse owner and yachtsman, and was knighted as a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1937.

In 1935 Davis was elected [[Mayor of Auckland City|Mayor of Auckland]] with Citizens' Committee endorsement, narrowly defeating Labour's candidate [[Joe Sayegh]] by only 400 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19350509.2.116.2 |title=City Mayoralty |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=9 May 1935 |volume=LXXII |issue=22104 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He greatly increased his majority when re-elected in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19380518.2.8.2 |title=Election of Mayor |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 May 1938 |volume=LXXV |issue=23040 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was appointed a Chevalier of the [[Légion d’honneur]] by the Republic of [[France]] on 2 April 1938 for his services to the [[French Navy]] during their visits to [[Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19380705.2.164 |title=Honoured by France: Auckland Citizens |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]] |date=5 July 1938 |volume=CXXVI |issue=4 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grande Chancellerie de la Legion d’Honneur Letter, CK/G2 743 F42011, dated 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His award was announced by the French Foreign Minister and recognised the never-failing courtesy and entertainment of [[French Navy|French Naval]] crews during visits to [[Auckland]], most notably the cruiser ''[[French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (1930)|Jeanne d’Arc]]'', which had visited only two months previous.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Mark, 'New Zealand and the Legion d'honneur: The Mid-War period', The Volunteers: The Journal of the New Zealand Military Historical Society, awaiting publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a brother of [[Eliot Davis]], MLC.&lt;ref name="DNZB Davis"&gt;{{DNZB|Bush|W. A. |4d7|Davis, Ernest Hyam|27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabriel Osawaru Igbinedion''' is the '''Esama''' of the [[Benin Kingdom]] in [[Nigeria]]. The title ''Esama'' traditionally means the "Son of the people", with responsibilities including assisting the poor in medial, monetary and private venture forms. He was  suspended from participating in palace activities  in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gabriel Igbinedion (Lucky's father) Removed as Bini Chief - declared Enemy of the Oba. 
|url=http://www.nigerianmuse.com/nigeriawatch/Gabriel_Igbinedion_Lucky_s_father_Removed_as_Bini_Chief |work=Nigerian Muse |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is on record that the [[Oba of Benin]] did not declare Chief Gabriel Osawaru Igbinedion as an enemy as it was widely circulated. On the 13th of June, 2012 a palace press release informed the general public that the suspension placed on Chief G.O. Igbinedion had been lifted. This was an affirmation that Gabriel Osawaru Igbinedion is still the  Esama of Benin Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Benin Traditional Council (June 13, 2012). Palace press release, reference no: BTC.A66/VOL.V/171&lt;/ref&gt;

The Esama of Benin's business empire includes an international property portfolio and a private TV and radio station. He owns a private bank, oil refinery, diamond, gold, marble mines over Africa, a private university (Igbinedion University, the first private university in Nigeria) and a large number of hotels.  He previously owned the now-defunct private airline, [[Okada Air]], of over 40 aircraft (planes and helicopters). He has built numerous churches including a Grand Catholic Cathedral, and has set up and owns a number of private hospitals across Nigeria.

One of the Esama's sons, [[Lucky Igbinedion|Lucky]], was a two-term Local Government Chairman and two-term Governor of Edo State, another, Charles, was a Local Government Chairman and one time  Edo State Commissioner of Education, while yet another, Peter, was the Managing Director of Nigerian Aviation Authority.Esama's daughter, Omosede is in the House of Representatives for Edo State.

The '''Ghent system''' is the name given to an arrangement in some countries whereby the main responsibility for [[welfare]] payments, especially [[unemployment benefits]], is held by [[trade union|trade/labor unions]], rather than a [[government agency]].

The system is named after the city of [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], where it was first implemented. It is the predominant form of unemployment benefit in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Sweden]]. Belgium has a hybrid or "quasi-Ghent" system, in which the government also plays a significant role in distributing benefits. In all of the above countries, unemployment funds held by unions or labour federations are regulated and/or partly [[subsidy|subsidised]] by the national government concerned.

Because workers in many cases need to belong to a union to receive benefits, union membership is higher in countries with the Ghent system. Furthermore, the state benefit is a fixed sum, but the benefits from unemployment funds depend on previous earnings.

The Swedish state decreased its financial support to the unemployment funds (most of them union-run, a few funds aimed for small entrepreneurs and one independent fund) from January 2007, with the result being that membership fees to unemployment funds had to be raised considerably, and union density declined from 77% in 2006 to 71% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Anders Kjellberg (2011) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/3462138/2064087.pdf "The Decline in Swedish Union Density since 2007"] ''Nordic Journal of Working Life Studies'' (NJWLS) Vol. 1. No 1 (August 2011), pp. 67-93&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 the fund fees were restored to about the same level as before 2007. In 2015 Swedish union density was 69% and the density of union unemployment funds 73% (75% if the independent Alfa fund is added).&lt;ref&gt;Kjellberg, Anders and Ibsen, Christian Lyhne (2016) [https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/21682547/Kjellberg_og_Ibsen_2016_ur_Due_og_Madsen.pdf "Attacks on union organizing:  Reversible and irreversible changes to the Ghent-systems in Sweden and Denmark"] in Trine Pernille Larsen and Anna Ilsøe (eds.)(2016) ''Den Danske Model set udefra (The Danish Model Inside Out) - komparative perspektiver på dansk arbejdsmarkedsregulering'', Copenhagen: Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Godfrey Lewis Rockefeller''' (September 24, 1783 – September 28, 1857), was an American farmer and businessman. He was an early settler of [[Richford, New York]] and his personal characteristics and hard life have led him to be called "a most unlikely progenitor of the clan".&lt;ref&gt;Chernow 2007, p3&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[William Rockefeller Sr.]] was the father of oil baron [[John D. Rockefeller]].

==Early life and marriage==
Godfrey Rockefeller was born September 24, 1783, in [[Albany, New York]]. His parents were William and Christina Rockefeller. William and Christina were third cousins; William's grandfather was Johann Peter Rockefeller II, a miller who migrated from [[Rhineland]], Germany, to [[Philadelphia]] where he was a plantation owner and landholder in [[Somerville, New Jersey|Somerville]], and [[Amwell, New Jersey]]. Christina's grandfather was Johann Peter's cousin, Diell Rockefeller, who immigrated to [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]]. In 1806, Godfrey married former schoolteacher, Lucy Avery (February 11, 1786 – April 6, 1867), in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], against opposition from her parents. Lucy's Avery ancestors were [[Puritans]] who had emigrated from [[Devon]], England, to [[Salem, Massachusetts]], in about 1630.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow 2007, p3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Godfrey was said to be outmatched by his wife, who was taller, more confident, and better educated than Godfrey. Godfrey himself was said to have a "stunted, impoverished look and a hangdog air of perpetual defeat". He was also said to be jovial and good-natured, but his propensity to drink upset his wife. The pair would have ten children.&lt;ref name="Chernow2007p4"&gt;Chernow 2007, p4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Godfrey and Lucy first lived in Great Barrington, where Godfrey became sheriff,&lt;ref&gt;Flynn 1933, p13&lt;/ref&gt; and worked as a farmer and businessman with little success. He and his young family moved from Great Barrington to [[Granger, New York]], and then to [[Ancram, New York]], and then to [[Livingston, New York]].&lt;ref name="Chernow2007p4"/&gt; Between 1832 and 1834, the family moved by [[Conestoga wagon]] west. Various reasons for this move have been given. One account is that Godfrey and several neighbors lost their land in a title dispute. Another is that Godfrey traded his farm for a farm in [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]], a trade which Godfrey would have been ill-advised to make as the farm at his final destination had thin acidic soil that was poor for farming. Another is that the family intended to move to Michigan, but Lucy preferred the New England culture of upstate New York. Whatever the reason, they spent two weeks along the [[Albany-Catskill turnpike]] with nine of their ten children (all excepting William) travelling to their new home, a sparsely populated wilderness near Richford, New York. A family legend is that from the top of the hill on his new, 60-acre property, Godfrey said that "This is as close as we shall ever get to Michigan", and therefore named the spot, [[New York State Forests#List of New York state forests|Michigan Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Chernow 2007, p4-5&lt;/ref&gt; At Michigan Hill, Lucy built a stone fence with two field-hands, and the family worked a farm. Their son, William, arrived in Richford in about 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow 2007, p6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and family==
Godfrey Lewis Rockefeller died on September 28, 1857, and Lucy died April 6, 1867, both in Richford, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins 1940, p31&lt;/ref&gt;  Godfrey and Lucy had 10 children:
*Melinda Rockefeller (September 12, 1807&lt;ref name="Sweet1894"&gt;Sweet 1894, p604-605&lt;/ref&gt; – May 2, 1880), married to William Harris
*Olymphia Rockefeller (April 20, 1809&lt;ref name="Sweet1894"/&gt; – ?),
*[[William Rockefeller Sr.|William Avery "Bill" Rockefeller Sr.]] (November 13, 1810 – May 11, 1906). His son [[John D. Rockefeller|John Davison Rockefeller Sr.]] began the Standard oil company in 1870. 
*Norman Rockefeller (October 27, 1812&lt;ref name="Sweet1894"/&gt; – January 20, 1905)
*Sally Ann Rockefeller (September 28, 1814&lt;ref name="Sweet1894"/&gt; – March 3, 1884)
*Jacob S. Rockefeller (July 14, 1816&lt;ref name="Sweet1894"/&gt; – August 14, 1892)
*Mary Rockefeller (February 18, 1819&lt;ref name="Sweet1894"/&gt; – July 15, 1819)
*Miles Avery Rockefeller (July 27, 1821&lt;ref name="Sweet1894"/&gt; – ?)
*Mary Miranda Rockefeller (June 17, 1824&lt;ref name="Sweet1894"/&gt; – November 12, 1879)
*Egbert Rockefeller (February 8, 1827&lt;ref name="Sweet1894"/&gt; – September 20, 1878).

'''Henry Drury Hatfield''' (September 15, 1875 – October 23, 1962) was an American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[politician]] from [[Logan County, West Virginia]].  He served a term as the [[List of Governors of West Virginia|14th Governor]] of the state, in addition to one term in the [[United States Senate]].  Hatfield was nephew to [[Devil Anse Hatfield]], leader of the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfield clan]].

Hatfield was born in [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]] (present-day [[Mingo County, West Virginia]]) on September 15, 1875.  He graduated from [[Franklin College (New Athens, Ohio)|Franklin College]] in [[New Athens, Ohio]].  He later obtained medical degrees from what is now known as the [[University of Louisville]] and later from [[New York University]]. In 1895, he married [[South Carolina "Carrie" Bronson Hatfield|South Carolina "Carrie" Bronson]].&lt;ref name=wvfl&gt;"West Virginia's First Ladies," West Virginia Division of Culture and History, June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed as [[surgery|surgeon]] for the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (1895–1913) and surgeon in chief of ''State Hospital #1'' in [[Welch, West Virginia]] (1899–1913).  He entered local politics first as commissioner of district roads of [[McDowell County, West Virginia|McDowell County]] (1900–1905), eventually becoming member of the State senate (1908–1912), and serving as president of the senate in 1911.

He was elected as [[Governor of West Virginia]] in 1912, when the southern coalfields were embroiled in the deadly [[Paint Creek–Cabin Creek strike of 1912|Paint Creek–Cabin Creek strike]]. His predecessor, [[William E. Glasscock]], had imposed martial law and imprisoned many striking miners. Hatfield began his term by pardoning [[Mary Harris Jones|Mother Jones]] and the miners who had been imprisoned by military courts, and then moving to negotiate a compromise to end the strike. He appointed a board of arbitration, and he himself chaired the board. The settlement presented to coal operators by Hatfield and the [[United Mine Workers of America|UMWA]] was staunchly opposed by local Socialists. In response, Hatfield deployed soldiers to force miners to agree to the compromise and ordered presses at Socialist newspapers in [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] and [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] destroyed.&lt;ref name=Corbin&gt;David A. Corbin, "Betrayal in the West Virginia Coal Fields: Eugene V. Debs and the Socialist Party of America, 1912-1914," March 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the expiration of his term in 1917, he entered the [[United States Army]] as a [[Major]] in the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Medical Corps]], serving as chief of the Surgical Service at Base Hospital No. 36 in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. 

He was discharged in 1919 and returned to West Virginia.  In 1928, he was elected to the United States Senate as a Republican, and served from March 4, 1929 to January 3, 1935.  He was defeated in a bid for reelection in 1934. 

After leaving the Senate, Hatfield settled in [[Huntington, West Virginia]] and established a private medical practice, where he worked until his death in 1962.

An '''honesty bar''' is an unattended beverage [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], typically in the lobby or lounge of a [[hotel]], where payment is left to the guest. Honesty bars differ significantly from in-room [[mini-bar]]s, where any consumption is automatically charged to the guest's account. 

Honesty bars are less common than staffed bars, but can be found in a number of [[boutique hotel]]s and other small hotels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Travel Weekly Group, London.|last=Watt|first=S|date=2012|work=The Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the executive floors of fine hotels. No staff attend the bar and therefore it is left to the honesty of the guest to report his or her own consumption. Honesty bars are convenient, since a guest can make or serve a drink at any time, keeping a tab for himself or herself for the length of the stay. Generally drinks are cheaper in an honesty bar, since no staff must be paid to attend the area continuously.

Honesty bars are generally stocked with popular beverages, mixers, and feature a standard bar setup. It is common to find a manual of basic cocktails.

[[File:Albany Lumber Yard 1870s.png|thumb|Frank A. Jagger loads his boat full of lumber at the [[Albany Lumber District]] in [[Albany, New York]] in the 1870s]]

A '''lumber yard''' is a location where [[lumber]] and [[wood]]-related products used in [[construction]] and/or [[home improvement]] projects are processed or stored. Some lumber yards offer [[retail]] sales to consumers, and some of these may also provide services such as the use of [[Thickness planer|planer]]s, saws and other large machines.

Generally, '''timber yards''' are locations where raw [[Trunk (botany)|logs]] and other wood or [[forest product]]s are processed and stored.&lt;ref&gt;Döring, Stephan (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=NU-NhpbJxFsC&amp;pg=PA72 ''Power from Pellets: Technology and Applications'']. Springer. pp. 72-74. {{ISBN|3642199623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "lumber yard" and "timber yard" are sometimes used interchangeably, and timber yards may include additional aspects that lumber yards encompass, and vice versa.

==Overview==
Lumber yards sell products made at [[lumber mill]]s,&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt; where customers pick up products at the yard themselves or request that an order be built and delivered to them by the lumber yard. Lumber yards may also sell wood-plastic composites, such as [[Trex (Composite Material)|Trex]], any other type of construction material or supplies, and general [[hardware store]] [[household hardware|items]]. Lumber yards are the primary resources for contractors and homeowners when construction material is needed. [[Home Depot]] stores also have lumber sections, but this may not be considered a ''lumber yard'', although it serves the same purpose. Lumber yards use [[forklift|forklift trucks]] to move the large heavy units of lumber around the yard. [[Saw]]s may also be available to cut boards to a desired length for customers.

At timber yards (also sometimes referred to as lumber yards), logs and other forest products are processed and stored. Additional activities include inspection for signs of rot, utilizing stacking techniques to prevent rot from forming, and the removal of bark and spraying of pesticides to prevent insect infestation.&lt;ref&gt;Jahnel, Franz (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4QTfTINjQtUC&amp;pg=PA67 ''Manual of Guitar Technology: The History and Technology of Plucked String Instruments'']. Bold Strummer. p. 67. {{ISBN|0933224990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lumber/timber yards use [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s to move logs, and sprinklers to keep the logs moist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enterprise-journal.com/news/article_94442a0c-58ff-11e2-bae0-0019bb2963f4.html?mode=image&amp;photo=0 | title=Lumber yard a busy place | publisher=''[[Enterprise Journal]]'' (McComb, Mississippi) | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Hall, Phillip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Products====
Some lumber yards sell products that are assessed and certified by the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]'s (FSC), per its standards. One lumber yard in [[Portland, Oregon]] limits its product line to only those that meet or exceed FSC's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portlandtribune.com/sl/158972-one-of-a-kind-lumber-yard-only-stocks-wood-that-meets-fsc-rules- | title=One-of-a-kind lumber yard only stocks wood that meets FSC rules | publisher=''[[Portland Tribune]]'' | date=August 15, 2013 | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Law, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Sustainable Northwest, a nonprofit environmental group in Portland, Oregon, began operations sourcing and purveying environmentally friendly "green wood" products.&lt;ref name="PT"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304703104575174541891049132 | title='Green Wood' Lumberyard Out on a Limb | publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' | date=April 12, 2010 | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Carlton, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group specializes in offering wood products that are sourced from trees in non-threatened forests.&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt;

====Fires====
In the United States, the [[National Fire Protection Association]] has been documenting incidences of lumber yard fires since 1998.&lt;ref name="HCN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.homechannelnews.com/article/recent-lumberyard-fires-bring-attention-safety | title=Recent lumberyard fires bring attention to safety | publisher=Home Channel News | accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products at lumber yards are very prone to fires, and electrical problems at lumber yards are a significant causation of fires.&lt;ref name="HCN"/&gt; In [[Murray, Utah]], after a large lumber yard fire caused approximately US$1 million in damage at the CECO Concrete Construction company, city residents called for companies in the city to take further preventative actions to prevent fires from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=3719268 | title=Neighbors calling for fire prevention requirements after lumberyard fire | publisher=KSL News | date=July 9, 2008 | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Johnson, Whit}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cities, such as [[Phoenix, Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phoenix.gov/webcms/groups/internet/@inter/@dept/@fire/@prev/documents/web_content/094048.pdf | title=Lumber Yards, Mulch Yards and Woodworking Facilities | publisher=Phoenix.gov | accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; city fire protection and prevention codes for lumber yards exist.

'''Management accounting principles (MAP)''' were developed to serve the core needs of internal management to improve decision support objectives, internal business processes, resource application, customer value, and capacity utilization needed to achieve corporate goals in an optimal manner.  Another term often used for management accounting principles for these purposes is managerial costing principles.  The two [[management accounting]] principles are:  
# ''Principle of Causality'' (i.e., the need for cause and effect insights) and,
# ''Principle of Analogy'' (i.e., the application of causal insights by management in their activities).

These two principles serve the management accounting community and its customers – the management of businesses.  The above principles are incorporated into the Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework (MCCF) along with concepts and constraints to help govern the management accounting practice.  The framework ends decades of confusion&lt;ref name=MAapproach&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=B.D.|author2=A. van der Merwe|title=Management Accounting - Approaches, Techniques, And Management Processes|journal=Cost Management|date=May–Jun 2006|pages=14–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding management accounting approaches, tools and techniques and their capabilities.

The framework of principles, concepts, and constraints will drive the classification of management accounting practices in the profession to ''"enable a better understanding both inside the profession and outside, of the compromises that result from inappropriate principles"''.&lt;ref name="WhyWeNeed"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=B.D.|author2=G.

Some management accounting methods are designed primarily to serve and comply with [[financial accountancy]] guidelines.  The importance of having distinct and separate principles exclusively for Management Accounting has received support and acknowledgement after almost a century of work on the topic.   The idea that separate management accounting principles exist for managerial decision support distinct from financial reporting needs is now recognized by professional accounting bodies such as the [[International Federation of Accountants]] [http://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/professional-accountants-business Professional Accountants In Business Committee] and the [[Institute of Management Accountants]] [http://www.imanet.org/resources_and_publications/ExposureDraft.aspx Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework (MCCF) Task Force].

==Brief History==
Prior to 1929 no group – public or private – was issuing or responsible for any accounting&lt;ref name=Kieso&gt;{{cite book|last=Kieso|first=D.E.|title=Intermediate Accounting|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-71757-6|url=http://www.wiley.com|edition=11th, vol.I|author2=J.J. Weygandt|author3= T.D. Warfield|page=6|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  standards.  After the 1929 stock market crash, a call to regain the public's confidence and investor's trust was demanded and the [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] was passed resulting in public companies being supervised by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] [https://www.sec.gov/ (SEC)].  This set the groundwork for GAAP [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)]], outlining financial accounting principles for external reporting standards for users of financial statements' information such as capital markets and creditors.

Over the next 47 years many individual committees, professional bodies and boards released various financial accounting procedural frameworks until 1976 when work began on a US framework that remains in place today, governed by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB). &lt;br /&gt;
Note:  Since April 1, 2001 the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] has been working on developing new international financial reporting standards. The new standards, referred to as [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), aim to update and refine existing concepts and provide descriptive guidance that includes comparisons of reporting requirements between [https://web.archive.org/web/20111020013013/http://www.ifrs.org/home.htm IFRS] and U.S. GAAP.  As a result of establishing International Financial Reporting Standards, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111020013013/http://www.ifrs.org/home.htm IASB] and [http://www.fasb.org/home FASB] Conceptual Frameworks and Standards are in the process of being updated and converged to reflect the changes in markets, business practices and the economic environment that have occurred in the two or more decades since the concepts were first developed.  One of the foundations of a set of Financial Accounting Standards is the creation of a Conceptual Framework that defines the principles upon which the standards will be based.  Most major national and international accounting standards have developed conceptual frameworks to support their work on setting standards.

In contrast, management accounting principles have been overlooked from both a conceptual and a standards point of view and, for the most part, overshadowed by financial accounting standards.  [[Generally accepted accounting principles]] applies strictly to financial accounting because it was either the only guidance they had at the time, or did not know what else to do.&lt;ref name=Crisis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=B.D.|title=Crisis !|journal=Strategic Finance|date=January 2007|pages=24–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Escaping&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=B.D.|author2=L.J. Matuszewski|author3= D.E. Tidrick|title=Escaping Professional Dominance?|journal=Cost Management|date=Sep–Oct 2011|pages=43–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Until recently, no serious work has been done by the accounting profession on the conceptual differences between the use of management accounting techniques to support GAAP financial reporting and management accounting techniques used for internal decision support.  This greatly compromises the management accounting practice and the ability of management accountants to provide managers with relevant decision support and optimization information. Yet, several innovative thinkers, shown in the Timeline below, saw value in management accounting having its own distinct set of principles.  Over the last century it is more and more evident that management accounting principles be viewed as "indispensable to the evaluation and improvement of MA methods and practices" (Clinton, Van der Merwe 2012).

==Historical timeline==
:'''1910 – Church. The History of Accounting'''.  The management accounting practice was originally discussed in a series of articles published in The Engineering Magazine.  As was typical of early management accounting practice after the industrial revolution, it was a topic of interest to engineers.  Church discussed practices that conveyed the management accounting principles of causality and analogy but never formally defined them.  The content of this series was reprinted in The History of Accounting Journal in 1976.&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{cite journal|last=Church|first=A.H.|title=Production Factors in Cost Accounting and Works Management|journal=The History of Accounting|year=1910|editor1=G.J.

:'''1923 – [[John Maurice Clark]]. Studies in the Economics of Overhead Costs'''.  Management Accounting theory developed and was embedded in his cost allocation discussion; Clark stressed the need to consider causes and their effects.  He was also the first to delineate operational cost concepts from decision cost concepts having introduced the concept of avoidability.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=J.M.|title=Studies in the Economics of Overhead Costs|year=1923|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''2002 – Richardson. Accounting Historians Journal'''. Alan Richardson documents five reasons why managerial accounting has been dominated by financial accounting:
# the use of financial accounting criteria to judge the quality of management accounting systems,
# the assignment of management accountants to subordinate positions in organizational units whose primary purpose was financial accounting,
# the dominance of financial accounting in the market for educational materials,
# the judgment of the labor market that a financial accountant could replace a management accountant (but not vice versa) and,

==Importance and objectives==
[[Management accounting]] for use inside an organization must reflect the reality of the operations and resources used by the organization in monetary terms. Unlike financial reporting, where the objective focuses on external investors and creditors seek to compare investment options across the capital markets, management accounting focuses on the economic choices and constraints within an organization. There are two interrelated parts in understanding why management accounting principles are so important and how these principles help managers achieve their primary objective: enterprise optimization.

The first principal part deals with the actual modeling of a company's operations, where the management accountant establishes and builds causal relationships based on the ''principle of causality'' and related management accounting concepts.  Part two involves the ''principle of analogy'' and the manager's analytical needs for decision support information provided by part one (its cause-and-effect relationships).  Part two requires analyzing the information in light of one or more decision alternatives so that the decision maker(s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Note: The term ''decision maker'' is defined as any internal manager who works in any department, not just reserved for decision makers in the accounting/finance dept.}}&lt;/ref&gt; can reach the optimum decision.  The cumulative application of both principles (causality and analogy) achieves management accounting's objectives and fulfills the managers' needs – the optimization of the company's operations, generally referred to as enterprise optimization.

'''First objective - managerial costing is:''' 
* To provide a monetary reflection of the provision and utilization of business resources and,
* To provide cause and effect insights into past, present, or future enterprise economic activities.
'''Second objective – managerial costing aids managers:'''
* In their planning, analysis, and decision making and,
* Supports optimizing the achievement of an enterprise's strategic objectives.

At a more granular level the consistent application of management accounting's principles hold a number of benefits for an organization.
* Provide managers and employees with an accurate, objective cost model of the organization and cost information that reflects the use of the organization's resources.
* Present decision support information in a flexible mold that caters to the timeline and insights needed for internal decision makers.
* Provide decision makers insight into the marginal/incremental aspects of the alternatives they are considering.
* Model quantitative cause and effect linkages between outputs and the inputs required to produce and deliver final outputs.
* Accurately values all operations (support and production) of an entity (i.e. the supply and consumption of resources) in monetary terms.
* Provides information that aids in immediate and future economic decision making for optimization, growth, and/or attainment of enterprise strategic objectives.
* Provides information to evaluate performance and learn from results.
* Provides the basis and baseline factors for exploratory and predictive managerial activities

==Truth as the foundation==
It is managerial accountants' job to provide correct information to all internal managers.  In other words, the costing information gathered must be factual and truthful, as in 'what is the cost that reflects the actual use of the resources and processes'.  Therefore, truth corresponds to facts and when applied to Management Accounting it translates to resources in operation creates a factual situation.  Obviously, the resources and operations about which a manager makes decisions on are based on factual information.  The manager's decision will act to change the current situation since the manager is interested in the economic impact of the possible outcomes.

Philip Lawton, investment professional and co-author of ''The Top Ten Operational Risks: A Survival Guide for Investment Management Firms and Hedge Funds''&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|title=The Top Ten Operational Risks: A Survival Guide for Investment Management Firms and Hedge Funds|date=December 2010|publisher=Stone House Consulting, LLC|location=Thornton, PA|isbn=978-1456367879|pages=80|author=Holly H. Miller|author2=Philip Lawton}}&lt;/ref&gt;   writes 
::''"Managerial costing is not to be confused with [[cost accounting]]. The latter (cost accounting) applies financial reporting conventions to inventory valuation, transfer pricing, and the cost of goods and services sold, and it serves the informational requirements of external parties, including investors, creditors, regulators, and tax authorities. Managerial costing is intended for internal use; it supports the decisions that managers make to optimize operations. The authors observe, "The stock market clearly does not value a company for excellently prepared financial statements if operational excellence is lacking." Moreover, in order to capture outputs and their required inputs, well-executed managerial costing uses data drawn from operational and logistical systems rather than general ledger accounts. In this way, operational quantities and costs are tied to the organization's internal value chain."''&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawton|first=Philip|title=Truth in Managerial Costing|url=http://middle-office.com/2012/07/20/truth-in-managerial-costing/|publisher=Middle Office|accessdate=30 July 2012|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Correspondence theory of truth]] was originally defined by Aristotle; however, a simpler and more up-to-date definition is: ''"A statement or opinion is true if what it corresponds to is a fact."''&lt;ref name=Angeles&gt;{{cite book|last=Angeles|first=P.A.|title=HarperCollins Dictionary of Philosophy|year=1992|publisher=Harper-Collins Publishers, Inc.|location=New York|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The correspondence definition of truth forms the foundational building blocks for management accounting's principles.   In this regard, the foundation of MAP is grounded in the laws of logic and structured reasoning outlined and discussed at length in the Management Accounting Philosophy series published in Cost Management.&lt;ref name=Philosophy1/&gt;  The recognition of truth as the basis for management accounting goes back a long way.
{{quotation|"It is very important that costs should not be regarded as something that may be manipulated, nor should they be thought of as representing anything but the cold truth, however unwelcome that may be."|Church, 1910}}

This emphasis on truth should not be confused with precision; it should be clear that costing methods are disputable, while principles are not.  Principles support managers who are required to make inferences about future outcomes of all the decision alternatives they are considering based on cause and effect insights. The use of principles enables managers to deal with causes and their effects in different time frames. This is not to say that management accounting is a science, it is not. But [[Decision science]] —that which management accounting supports, with the information it provides — is a science&lt;ref name=MCCF/&gt;{{cite journal|page=119}}
{{quotation|"In order to provide a sound basis for decisions, cost measurements should, in so far as possible, reflect the truth".|Benninger, 1954}}

The growth of management accounting and its practices as outlined in ''Management Accounting – Approaches, Techniques and Management Processes'',&lt;ref name=MAapproach/&gt; mentions that management accountants remain dissatisfied with the quality of their management accounting information in the absence of guiding principles.  This disconnect is clearly documented in research such as the ''2003 Survey of Management Accounting''&lt;ref name=Survey2003&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 Survey of Management Accounting|url=http://www.imanet.org/resources_and_publications/research_studies_and_statements/ima_sponsored_studies.aspx|publisher=Institute of Management Accountants|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Ernst &amp; Young,  LLP|author2=IMA|pages=24|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by Ernst &amp; Young LLP; co-sponsored by IMA and the follow up survey ''2012 Alta Via, SAP, and IMA Management Accounting Survey: A Replication and Longitudinal Comparison''.&lt;ref name=2012Survey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=B.D.|author2=L.R. White|title=2012 Alta Via, SAP, and IMA Management Accounting Survey: A Replication and Longitudinal Comparison|journal=Management Accounting Quarterly|date=(Forthcoming)|year=2012|publisher=Institute of Management Accountants|location=Montvale}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Confusion and frustration took hold of the MA profession partly because accountants were trying to satisfy two very different goals with one information system; the compliance needs of financial reporting (GAAP) alongside managerial costing decision analysis needs.  In addition, controllers, accountants, and managers who were seeking to improve operations or resolve internal costing issues discovered that when selecting different costing methods, each one subscribes to assorted allocation techniques and produces very different results.  And finally, the lack of a conceptual framework and foundational principles that previously did not exist in order to do costing for internal decision support.

Contradicting theories and practices do not instill trust or truth towards the optimization of an entity.  Foundational principles are intended to drive the classification of approaches, tools, and processes, thereby providing a way for accountants and managers to evaluate the tools and approaches they may be considering for the decision or costing tasks at hand.  The principles function as a way of better understanding the risks and compromises associated with a practice or method when it strays from the principles of causality and analogy.

==Not GAAP==
Companies need to identify the economic reality of their organization based on resources and operations, not reflect dollar values calculated using accrual-based accounting methods that conform to [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)]].  Accountants may argue that financial accounting principles represent true values and are more than sufficient for management accounting purposes.  Maximizing financial statement results is a primary objective; however, focusing only on accounting numbers or common financial ratios can lead to bad behavior versus focusing on operations and resource use for long term sustainable economic success.
By examining two of the four financial accounting principles, it will reveal that financial accounting principles (e.g., [[Historical cost]], [[Revenue recognition]], [[Matching principle]], and Full Disclosure) '''do not''' serve the objectives of management accounting. Let's examine the following two GAAP principles:

:a)	[[Historical cost]] principle (Kieso, Weygandt and Warfield)p38 – the only time this principle reflects ''cost''   is at the initial time of purchase or acquisition.  In subsequent periods, the historical cost along with taxation-driven depreciation methods does not help managers determine their current operational cost factors.

:b)	[[Matching principle]] (Kieso, Weygandt and Warfield)p40 – this principle mandates that the costs (expenses) must follow revenues or adopt the best ''"rational and systematic"'' allocation of costs associated with the benefit, including assumptions about when the benefit (and therefore costs) are to be received.  Clearly, managers who are required to perform a cost analysis would have no idea under the matching principle what costs would be included/excluded or be currently impacting his department.

The two financial accounting principles noted above briefly describes the chasm that exists between financial accounting and managerial accounting objectives.  Financial accounting's objective is to produce a coherent set of standards for consistency and comparability purposes; therefore, providing external parties in the capital markets, a level playing field for evaluating a company's individual performance as well as across other competing businesses.  Where Management accounting's objectives exist is to inform internal managers of the correct choices for long term economic success.

As discussed with Larry R. White, task force member of the Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework, in [http://www3.cfo.com/ CFO.com], 
::''"Manufacturing companies, in particular, often run into problems from the use of GAAP models for internal costing purposes, White notes. "We've seen factories where salesmen line up to get their orders run by the oldest production line in the factory, while there are brand-new production lines and machines sitting idle that would produce the order quicker and with better quality. The reason is that the factory was doing its costing based on a derivation of GAAP standards. Consequently, the fully depreciated machines didn't have a depreciation charge associated with them, where the newer machinery did."''&lt;ref name=CFO&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffelder|first=K.|title=Managerial Accountants Want Their Own Kind of Costing|url=http://www3.cfo.com/article/2012/7/gaap-ifrs_gaap-institute-of-management-accountants-international-federation-of-accountants|publisher=CFO.com|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts and Constraints==
[[File:MCCF v2.jpg|thumb|Diagram of ''Principles, Concepts, and Constraints'' specific to the field of [[Management Accounting]] and its internal business users.]]

===Principles===
Management accountants can rely on ''causality'' and ''analogy'' as foundational principles as they are grounded in decision science – the laws of logic.  
:* '''Causality principle''' — the relation between a managerial objective's quantitative output and the input quantities that must be, or must have been, consumed if the output is to be achieved.
Principle of Causality enables modeling the organization's costs based on the relationship between the inputs and outputs of the resources involved in the production of products and services it provides.  Often this is straightforward when dealing with strong causal relationships (i.e. raw materials to make product A).  However, where weaker causal relationships exist, costs need to be attributed according to the concept of attributability, which maintains the integrity of causality.
:* '''Analogy principle''' — the use of causal insights to infer past or future outcomes.
Principle of Analogy governs the user of management accounting information's ability to apply the knowledge or insights gained from the causal relationships modeled (e.g., in planning, control, what-if analysis) using inductive and deductive reasoning about past and future outcomes for continuous optimization efforts.

===Concepts===
The following '''concepts''' serve as operational guidelines and modeling building blocks to the two main principles (causality and analogy) in developing a reflective cause &amp; effect model and then using the information the model provides.  These concepts are intended to cover a variety of assumptions that would make up a model, their characteristics, and relationships and to provide rational perspectives when modeling many managerial costing issues.

The first '''ten concepts''' support the ''Principle of Causality'' the modeling of Cause&amp;Effect-based modeling principles, while the remaining '''four concepts''' are applicable to the ''Principle of Analogy'' and informational in nature and supports managers with decision making guidelines.

:'''Concepts applicable to causality and modeling:'''
* Attributability
* Capacity
* Cost
* Homogeneity
* Integrated data orientation
* Managerial objective
* Resource
* Responsiveness
* Traceability
* Work

:'''Concepts applicable to analogy and information use:'''
* Avoidability
* Divisibility
* Interdependence
* Interchangeability

===Constraints===
The following '''constraints''' have been identified for management accounting.  The quantitative and qualitative characteristics of these constraints are meant to serve as controls or checks and balances when constructing a cost model  or when using management accounting information.  The first '''five constraints''' are specific to '''Causality''' in the cost model, while the remaining '''two constraints''' deal with '''Analogy''' and the use of the information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imanet.org/PDFs/Public/Research/CFMC%20Draft%20for%20Review.pdf Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework]&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Constraints applicable to causality:'''
* Materiality
* Measurability
* Objectivity
* Verifiability

:'''Constraints applicable to analogy information use:'''
*Congruence
*Impartiality

He has been hailed as "one of Kenya's leading industrialists".&lt;ref name="wiki"&gt;{{cite news| title= Manu Chandaria shares basics to getting ahead in life | publisher = businessdailyafrica.com| date=3 August 2009| url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/-/539444/633666/-/item/0/-/js86r9/-/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Chandaria's father, an Indian merchant from [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], Gujarat,&lt;ref name="premchand"/&gt; moved to Kenya in 1915 to start a provisions shop along Biashara street in Nairobi.  He, Chandaria, grew up in the Ngara area of Nairobi in a house that was home to three other families, where he assisted his father in the shop. Chandaria has conceded that while he, "wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth, there were at least spoons in the house"&lt;ref name="article"&gt;{{cite news| title=Manu Chandaria – Hindustan Times| date=19 October 2011| url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Manu-Chandaria/Article1-3980.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; an attestation to his humble beginnings. However, his father, a semi-literate, was determined on giving the young Chandaria the best education available.

==Education==
Chandaria attended various schools in Nairobi and [[Mombasa]] in Kenya from where he proceeded to India for his undergraduate studies. He graduated from Jamnagar India University, [[Bombay]] in 1949 with a Bachelor of Science from whence he proceeded to [[Oklahoma]] in the US. He graduated in 1950 with a [[BSc|bachelor]] in engineering and continued with his [[Masters degree|masters]], which he obtained in 1951 from the [[University of Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="manu"/&gt; It was from here he returned to Kenya to find a prospering family enterprise and thus a platform where he would apply his swift business acumen to wrest a multinational conglomerate from the provisional shop that had once been.

==Business==
Shortly before Chandaria and his brother's return to Kenya, their family had amassed substantial holdings that made it possible for their entry into the lucrative steel and aluminium industry.&lt;ref name="article"/&gt;
Chandaria's future father-in-law had organised a group of ten individuals to acquire saucepan manufacturer Kenya Aluminium, an enterprise that had folded during the [[Great Depression|depression]], from an Indian merchant in 1929,&lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt; although this group eventually broke up to pursue different ventures some twenty years later.&lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt; Such were the earnest beginnings of the future $2.5 billion Comcraft Group.&lt;ref name="structure"&gt;{{cite news| title= Fedha: Manu Chandaria. Businessman &amp; Philanthropist extraordinaire| date=9 September 2007| url=http://fedha.blogspot.com/2007/09/to-our-own-manu-chandaria-businessman_09.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the onset of the 1950s and 60s came the expansion of Comcraft to other countries such as [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[India]], [[Zambia]] and elsewhere with Chandaria being charged with business affairs in [[Uganda]], and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].
He is today a senior member of Comcraft Group, Chairman of Bank of India Advisory Committee in Nairobi among others.&lt;ref name="manu"/&gt; His personal business interests are extensive and span the vast of the Kenyan economy and as well as 50 other countries.&lt;ref name="chandaria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt; In a recent interview for the Creating Emerging Markets project at the [[Harvard Business School]], he defends the notion that businesses should look at profit as the means, and not the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/emerging-markets/pages/profile-detail.aspx?profile=mchandaria |title=Interview with Manu Chandaria |website=Creating Emerging Markets |publisher=Harvard Business School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Chandaria is a committed [[Jain]], and in fulfilment of the principles of Jainism his family set up the Chandaria Foundation to further this belief. As Comcraft operates in more than 11 African countries, the Chandaria family has set up charitable trusts in each country to assist in their philanthropic exploits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Philanthropy in Kenya| date=September–October 2007| url=http://www.synergos.org/globalgivingmatters/features/0710kenyaphilanthropy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the chairman of the Chandaria Foundation he is at the forefront of the charitable work of the family. He is the benefactor of numerous schools and clincs in Kenya and is or has been with involved with more than 25 organisations.&lt;ref name="manu"/&gt; Chandaria cites [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Henry Ford]] as the inspiration for his philanthropic streak due to their establishing the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[Ford Foundation]] respectively.&lt;ref name="structure"/&gt;

'''Michael Bidwill''' (born December 6, 1964) is an American [[businessman]], prosecutor, and [[American football|football]] executive. He is the current president of the [[Arizona Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). After practicing law for six years as a federal prosecutor, Michael Bidwill joined the [[Arizona Cardinals]] organization in 1996 as Vice President/General Counsel. Today he serves as team President, a position he had held since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prod.static.cardinals.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/2013MediaGuide/13MG.History.pdf|title=Arizona Cardinals Media Guide |author=Arizona Cardinals|publisher=Arizona Cardinals Football Club|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Michael Bidwill grew up the second of five children in his family. He began to enjoy American football when he visited the Cardinals' training camp for the first time in 1969. In 1974, Bidwill's father, [[Bill Bidwill|Bill]], made him one of the team's ball boys including his brothers William Jr., Patrick and Tim. Said Bidwill in 2007: "I understood at a young age that when you don't win, there will be criticism." Michael Bidwill attended [[Georgetown Prep]] and later earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from [[Saint Louis University]] in 1987 where he was a member of [[Phi Delta Theta]]. Later, he graduated from the [[Columbus School of Law]] at [[The Catholic University of America|Catholic University]] in 1990. From 1990–96, Michael was a federal prosecutor in Phoenix.

==Professional career==
===Arizona Cardinals===

While the Cardinals struggled to fill Sun Devil Stadium, Bidwill publicly stated that fans would respond in greater numbers if given a better environment. He additionally emphasized that the team could not compete without the revenue streams a new stadium would bring. The Cardinals have sold out all 100 games played since the stadium opened in 2006. They sold out 12 total games in 18 seasons at [[Sun Devil Stadium]]. In nine seasons at [[State Farm Stadium]], the Cardinals have won their conference once, their [[NFC West|division]] three times,  earned three playoff berths and finished .500 or better in 6 of 9. They had two seasons of .500 or better in 18 seasons before moving into [[State Farm Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/cardinals/articles/20131226bruce-arians-makes-arizona-cardinals-game-plan-early-birds.html|title=Bruce Arians makes Arizona Cardinals game plan early birds|author=Bob McManaman|publisher=Arizona Republic|date=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a column published on October 23, 2014 entitled ''Arizona Cardinals rebranding themselves with wins and presence'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-arizona-cardinals-farmer-20141024-column.html#page=1|author=Sam Farmer |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=23 October 2014|title=Arizona Cardinals rebranding themselves with wins and presence|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cardinals General Manager [[Steve Keim]] called Bidwill "the glue that holds the organization together." In the same piece, quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] had the following to say about Bidwill:

"It's easy to say it's the head coach or the GM. It's the owner," Palmer said. "And you would never know it. He doesn't want to be here when the media's here. He's not doing interviews left and right, but he's picked the right people to hire and he wants to win. … He doesn't have a hand in every decision, cutting this guy, bringing in this guy. He's hired the right people, and he knows it."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-arizona-cardinals-farmer-20141024-column.html#page=1|author=Sam Farmer |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=23 October 2014|title=Arizona Cardinals rebranding themselves with wins and presence|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Bidwill announced his support for longtime friend and fellow Georgetown Prep classmate [[Brett Kavanaugh]] as a Supreme Court Justice nominee. The move generated controversy, as Bidwill used the Arizona Cardinals website and social media outlets to voice his support. This came just two months after NFL owners voted to restrict NFL players' ability to protest during the national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://deadspin.com/michael-bidwill-still-thinks-high-school-pal-brett-kava-1829064087|publisher=Deadspin|title=Michael Bidwill Still Thinks High School Pal Brett Kavanaugh Should Be Confirmed To The Supreme Court|date=2018-09-17|last=Kalaf|first=Samer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2018/07/10/arizona-cardinals-michael-bidwell-support-supreme-court-nominee-nfl-hypocrisy/770404002/|title=Stick to sports? Cardinals' support of Supreme Court nominee shows NFL's hypocrisy|last=Armour|first=Nancy|publisher=USA Today|date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State Farm Stadium====
Wrote the Washington Post in 2009, "It's the new stadium, many people inside and outside the organization said, that began the Cardinals' transformation from laughingstock into Super Bowl participant. Once the stadium was built, the team could emerge from its days of having to play before small crowds on a torn-up field as the secondary occupant of Arizona State University's Sun Devil Stadium." [4]

Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen told Forbes in 2007, "Their biggest problem was that they needed a new stadium...The stadium is the underpinning of a significantly new situation for the Cardinals." Added Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, "The league needs a successful franchise in that booming area of the country. They maybe have an opportunity to thrive." [5]

Cardinals defensive end Bertrand Berry to the ''Boston Globe'' in 2009: "The biggest thing was to get the stadium; not being out there in Sun Devil Stadium in blistering temperatures with people not really wanting to go out there. I mean we didn't want to play out there it was so hot. With the new stadium it's brought excitement. With the new players that have been drafted and free agency, everything has just come together. It was a perfect storm for us." [6]

== Other positions ==
In addition to his role with the Cardinals, Bidwill has been active in the greater Phoenix business community where he has been an advocate for economic growth and development.

From 2008-10, Bidwill served back-to-back terms as Chairman of [[Greater Phoenix Economic Council]] (GPEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nflcommunications.com/2010/10/07/cardinals-president-michael-bidwill-honored-tonight-in-phoenix/|title=Cardinals president Michael Bidwill honored tonight in Phoenix|author=Staff|publisher=NFLCommunications.com|date=7 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408220608/http://nflcommunications.com/2010/10/07/cardinals-president-michael-bidwill-honored-tonight-in-phoenix/|archivedate=8 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a board member of Greater Phoenix Leadership (GPL), an organization composed of the region's top business and civic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gplinc.org/about/members.aspx|title=Member Directory|author=Staff|publisher=Greater Phoenix Leadership|accessdate=7 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701195501/http://www.gplinc.org/about/members.aspx|archivedate=1 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2011, Bidwill and 16 business leaders in the state were appointed to the Arizona Commerce Authority Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcommerce.com/about-us/board-of-directors|title=ACA Board of Directors|author=Staff|publisher=Arizona Commerce Authority|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael is also a member of the board for the [[Pat Tillman]] Foundation, which carries on the legacy of the former Cardinals safety killed in Afghanistan in 2004.

In 2010, Bidwill was selected by the Phoenix Business Journal as one of its 25 "Most Admired CEO's." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nflcommunications.com/2010/10/07/cardinals-president-michael-bidwill-honored-tonight-in-phoenix/|title=Cardinals president Michael Bidwill honored tonight in Phoenix|author=Staff|publisher=NFLCommunications.com|date=7 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408220608/http://nflcommunications.com/2010/10/07/cardinals-president-michael-bidwill-honored-tonight-in-phoenix/|archivedate=8 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, he received the Leader for Tomorrow award from the [[Boy Scouts of America]].

In 2014, it was announced that Bidwill was named the chair of the league's new conduct committee. Composed of representatives of NFL ownership, the committee will review the league's Personal Conduct Policy at least annually and recommend appropriate changes with advice from outside experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000441758/article/nfl-owners-endorse-new-personal-conduct-policy|author=National Football League |publisher=NFL.com |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also chairs the NFL's Security and Fan Conduct Committee, a group of eight club executives that oversees and develops best security practices for NFL facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.azcardinals.com/team/staff/michael-bidwill/61a8f54f-126b-42db-8d51-78e54b8b0288|title=Arizona Cardinals: Michael Bidwill, President|publisher=[[Arizona Cardinals]]|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also serves on the board of the [[NFL Charities|National Football League Foundation]], which in 2013 awarded more than $23 million in grants to support youth and high school football programs, health and safety efforts, as well as community health initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nflcommunications.com/2012/12/12/nfl-announces-new-charitable-organization-the-national-football-league-foundation/|title=NFL Announces New Charitable Organization: The National Football League Foundation|author=Staff|publisher=NFLCommunications.com|date=12 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408214837/http://nflcommunications.com/2012/12/12/nfl-announces-new-charitable-organization-the-national-football-league-foundation/|archivedate=8 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bidwill has also been a member of the league's Business Ventures Committee since 2007 when Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] appointed him to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcwest/post/_/id/16945/kroenke-nfc-west-committee-roles|title=Kroenke, NFC West committee roles|author=Mike Sando|publisher=ESPN|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bidwill serves on Arizona's Super Bowl Host Committee. The group oversaw the successful staging of [[Super Bowl XLII]] at [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflfoundation.org/board_members/board_members/view/2|title=Michael Bidwill|author=Staff|publisher=NFLFoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also brought [[Super Bowl XLIX]], which was played on February 1, 2015 and its half billion dollar economic impact to the state.

"We're thrilled about being here, and we look forward to coming back." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nfl/super-bowl/2015/02/03/valley-leaders-already-plotting-arizona-next-super-bowl/22818099/ |publisher=The Arizona Republic |accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Takeda Oncology''', (originally '''Millennium Pharmaceuticals'''), is a biopharmaceutical company based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]. It is a fully owned subsidiary of [[Takeda Pharmaceutical]].

Takeda Oncology's [[research]], development and commercialization activities focused in two [[therapeutic]] areas: [[oncology]] and [[inflammation]] to develop a line of new product candidates. It was one of the first companies to systematically search for genes linked to disease,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; although none of the drugs which it is marketing or has in clinical trial, with one partial exception, have been the results of that research.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=Shift Seen Atop Takeda Oncology|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/business/29drug.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2005-06-29 |accessdate=2008-02-23 | first=Andrew | last=Pollack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly known for bringing [[bortezomib]] (marketed as [[Velcade]]) through clinical trials to approval for treatment of patients with [[multiple myeloma]] by the U.S. FDA, but has a growing clinical development [[sales pipeline|pipeline]] of other product candidates.

On May 14, 2008, Japanese company Takeda Pharmaceutical announced the completion of its acquisition of Millennium for US$25.00 per share in cash—a deal worth $8.8 billion. Takeda completed the acquisition through a tender offer and subsequent merger as a wholly owned subsidiary '''Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company''' - with the name being simplified to Takeda Oncology in 2013.

== History ==
Millennium was founded in 1993. In its early years, Millennium focused on building science and business teams. 
Beginning in 1994, Millennium created more than 20 strategic alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These alliances provided Millennium with close to $2 billion of committed funding that was used to develop and enhance its pipeline.

A merger with Leukosite in 1999 brought the company its first drug close-to-market, [[Campath]]  (alemtuzumab) Injection, and additional investigational drugs in clinical trials.  In 2000, a merger with Cambridge Discovery [[Chemistry]] gave Millennium a strong presence in the United Kingdom and added to the organization more than 100 scientists with expertise in chemistry. In a strategic business decision, Campath was later sold to the Millennium partner for the drug, ILEX Oncology, which in turn was acquired by [[Genzyme]].

In February 2002, there was a further merger with COR Therapeutics—among the largest such mergers in the history of the biotech industry at that time. In addition to creating a strong pipeline of novel therapeutics, the merger added cardiovascular research and drug development to the company's other key therapeutic areas: oncology and inflammation. The merger also brought Integrilin ([[eptifibatide]]) Injection, an intravenous anti-[[platelet]] drug for patients with severe [[cardiovascular diseases]], into the Millennium fold. Millennium partnered with [[Schering-Plough]] on the development and marketing of Integrilin until 2005 when Millennium licensed the exclusive U.S. commercialization and development rights of Integrilin to Schering-Plough.

In May 2003 Velcade was launched for the treatment of relapsed and refractory [[multiple myeloma]] – a cancer of the blood.  At the time, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) granted approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma for patients who had not responded to at least two other therapies for the disease.  Velcade — the first FDA-approved [[proteasome]] inhibitor — reached the market in record time and represented the first treatment in more than a decade to be approved for patients with multiple myeloma.

In late December 2007, Millennium successfully submitted a supplemental new drug application ([[sNDA]]) to the FDA for Velcade for previously untreated multiple myeloma. The sNDA submitted to the FDA for this indication included data from the Phase III VISTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-05|url=http://investor.millennium.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=80159&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1052541&amp;highlight=|title=VELCADE as Initial Standard Therapy in multiple myeloma: Assessment with melphalan and prednisone |publisher=Millennium Corporate Communications }}&lt;/ref&gt; study, a large, well-controlled [[international]] clinical trial, comparing a Velcade-based regimen to a traditional standard of care. Priority review was granted by the FDA in January 2008.  On June 20, 2008, the FDA approved VELCADE in combination for patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. This means that Millennium can market Velcade to patients who have not had any prior therapies for multiple myeloma (a first-line therapy).

In May 2008, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited purchased Millennium for $8.8 billion. Millennium was operating as an independent subsidiary, serving as the global center of excellence in oncology under its new name: "Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company". This global footprint includes oncology research and marketing strategy and oversight. In addition to Cambridge, MA, oncology resources include facilities in San Diego, San Francisco, Tsukuba and Osaka with Millennium as the global hub for this critical and rapidly expanding therapeutic area.

In summer 2013 the decision was made by Takeda to drop the "Millennium" brand effectively renaming the subsidiary into Takeda Oncology.
However, Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc is still a legal holding of Takeda and its name is still used for on-going legal processes.

Velcade is the first oncology drug marketed and promoted by Millennium. Velcade was granted FDA approval little more than four and a half years after initiation of the first clinical trial. To discover and develop such treatments, the Company focuses on key molecular pathways that play crucial roles in underlying disease processes, and on identifying therapeutically significant differences that may exist among [[people]].  Takeda Oncology applies this approach broadly throughout its R&amp;D program to develop novel treatments not just for cancer but also for a number of other important diseases.

Velcade was co-developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals. and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Development. Takeda is responsible for [[commercialization]] of Velcade in the U.S. and Janssen-Cilag is responsible for commercialization in Europe and the rest of the world. Janssen Pharmaceutical K.K. is responsible for commercialization in Japan. For a limited period of time, Takeda and Ortho Biotech. are co- promoting Velcade in the U.S. Approved in 85 countries, at least 85,000 patients have been treated with Velcade globally.

The '''National Mining Association''' ('''NMA''') is a United States [[trade organization]] that lists itself as the voice of the [[mining industry]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] NMA was formed in 1995, and has more than 300 corporate members.

==History==
The National Mining Association was created in 1995. The organization was formed through the merger of the National Coal Association (NCA) and the American Mining Congress (AMC). These two organizations had represented the mining industry since 1897 (AMC) and 1917 (NCA).&lt;ref name=NMA&gt;National Mining Association [http://www.nma.org/about/info.asp About NMA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005201707/http://nma.org/about/info.asp |date=2010-10-05 }}. Official website of the National Mining Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and objectives==
The NMA's mission is "to create and maintain a broad base of political support for the mining industry and to help the nation realize the economic and national security benefits of America's domestic mining capability."&lt;ref name = NMA/&gt;

The objective of the NMA is "to engage in and influence the public policy process on the most significant and timely issues that impact our ability to locate, permit, mine, process, transport and utilize the nation's vast coal and mineral resources."&lt;ref name = NMA/&gt;

The NMA serves its membership through the following actions:
*Promoting the production and use of coal and mineral resources produced by the U.S. mining industry; 
*Establishing a political presence in the Nation's Capital on behalf of NMA's membership; 
*Serving as an information center for and a single voice of the U.S. mining industry {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}; and 
*Addressing the current and future needs of the industry, mining equipment manufacturers and support services members of the association.&lt;ref name = NMA/&gt;

==Legislation==

===Supported===
*[[Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America (H.R. 2824; 113th Congress)]] - is a bill that would amend the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977]] to require state programs for regulation of [[Surface mining|surface coal mining]] to incorporate the necessary rule concerning excess spoil, coal mine waste, and buffers for perennial and intermittent streams published by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement on December 12, 2008.&lt;ref name=2824sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2824 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2824|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Mining Association supported the bill, with its President, [[Hal Quinn]], saying "this bill accomplishes the important task sometimes lacking in public policy: it balances the needs of the economy with the needs of the environment."&lt;ref name=SmartEnergy&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnson, Lamborn Introduce Legislation To Protect Jobs, Help Stop Administration’s War on Coal|url=http://www.smartenergyuniverse.com/regulatory/19688-johnson-lamborn-introduce-legislation-to-protect-jobs-help-stop-administration-s-war-on-coal|publisher=Smart Energy Universe|accessdate=5 March 2014|date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The '''Ohlson O-Score for predicting bankruptcy''' is a multi-factor financial formula postulated in 1980 by Dr. [[James Ohlson]] of the [[New York University]] Stern Accounting Department as an alternative to the [[Altman Z-score]] for predicting financial distress.&lt;ref name="ycharts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ycharts.com/glossary/terms/ohlson_score|title=Ohlson's O-Score Definition|website=ycharts.com|accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation of the O-Score==
The Ohlson O-Score is the result of a 9-factor linear combination of [[coefficient]]-weighted business ratios which are readily obtained or derived from the standard periodic financial disclosure statements provided by publicly traded corporations.  Two of the factors utilized are widely considered to be dummies as their value and thus their impact upon the formula typically is 0.&lt;ref name="stockopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockopedia.com/content/improving-on-the-altman-z-score-part-2-the-ohlson-o-score-70800/|title=Improving On The Altman Z-Score, Part 2: The Ohlson O-Score | first = Jonathan | last = Stokes | date = 13 February 2013 | website=stockopedia.com|accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When using an O-Score to evaluate the probability of company’s failure, then exp(O-Score) is divided by 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;exp(O-score).&lt;ref name="fdic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/2008/jan/CFR_SS_2008_KarlynMitchell.pdf|date=7 January 2008|title=Bankers on Boards, Financial Constraints, and Financial Distress (''Preliminary and incomplete.

==Interpretation==

The original model for the O-Score was derived from the study of a pool of just over 2000 companies, whereas by comparison its predecessor the Altman Z-Score considered just 66 companies. As a result, the O-Score is significantly more accurate a predictor of bankruptcy within a 2-year period. The original Z-Score was estimated to be over 70% accurate with its later variants reaching as high as 90% accuracy. The O-Score is more accurate than this.

However, no mathematical model is 100% accurate, so while the O-Score may forecast bankruptcy or solvency, factors both inside and outside of the formula can impact its accuracy. Furthermore, later [[bankruptcy prediction]] models such as the hazard based model proposed by Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi in 2011&lt;ref name="citeseerx"&gt;{{cite paper | citeseerx = 10.1.1.233.2093 | title = Predicting financial distress and the performance of distressed stocks | first1 = John Y. | last1 = Campbell | first2 = Jens | last2 = Hilscher | first3 = Jan | last3 = Szilagyi }}&lt;/ref&gt; have proven more accurate still. For the O-Score, any results larger than 0.5 suggests that the firm will default within two years.

The '''Pacific Fur Company''' (PFC) was an American [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] venture wholly owned and funded by [[John Jacob Astor]] that functioned from 1810 to 1813. It was based in the [[Pacific Northwest]], an area contested over the decades between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the [[Spanish Empire]], the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[Russian Empire]].

Management, clerks and fur trappers were sent both by land and by sea to the Pacific Coast in the Autumn of 1810. The base of operations was constructed at the mouth of the [[Columbia River]] in 1811, [[Fort Astoria]] (present-day [[Astoria, Oregon]]). The destruction of the company vessel the ''[[Tonquin (1807)|Tonquin]]'' later that year off the shore of [[Vancouver Island]] took with it the majority of the annual trading goods. Commercial competition with the British-Canadian [[North West Company]] began soon after the foundation of Fort Astoria. The Canadian competitors maintained several stations in the interior, primarily [[Spokane House]], [[Kootanae House]] and [[Saleesh House]]. [[Fort Okanogan]] was also opened in 1811, the first of several PFC posts created to counter these locations. The [[Pacific Fur Company#Overland Expedition|Overland Expedition]] faced military hostilities from several [[Native Americans in the United States|Indigenous cultures]] and later had an acute provision crisis leading to starvation. Despite losing men crossing the [[Great Plains]] and later at the [[Snake River]], they arrived in groups throughout January and February 1812 at Fort Astoria.

A beneficial agreement with the [[Russian-American Company]] was also planned through the regular supply of provisions for posts in [[Russian America]]. This was planned in part to prevent the rival [[Montreal]] based [[North West Company]] (NWC) to gain a presence along the Pacific Coast, a prospect neither Russian colonial authorities nor Astor favored.{{sfn|Tikhmenev|1978|pp=116-118}}

The lack of military protection during the [[War of 1812]] forced the sale of PFC assets to the NWC. While the transactions were not finalized until 1814, due to the distance from Fort Astoria to Montreal and New York City, the company was functionally defunct by 1813. A party of Astorians returning overland to [[St. Louis]] in 1813 made the important discovery of the [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] through the [[Rocky Mountains]]. This geographic feature would later be used by hundreds of thousands of settlers traveling over the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]] routes, collectively called the [[Westward Expansion Trails]]. The emporium envisioned by Astor was a failure for a number of reasons, including the loss of two supply ships, the material difficulties of crossing the North American continent and competition from the North West Company. Historian Arthur S. Morton concluded that "The misfortunes which befell the Pacific Fur Company were great, but such as might be expected at the initiation of an enterprise in a distant land whose difficulties and whose problems lay beyond the experience of the traders."{{sfn|Morton|1973|p=503}}

==Formation==
{{main|American Fur Company}}

[[File:John Wesley Jarvis - John Jacob Astor - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[John Jacob Astor]] established the Pacific Fur Company as part of his grandiose plans to gain commercial hegemony over major fur producing areas in the [[North American fur trade]] against his [[North West Company|North West]] and [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson's Bay]] competitors.]]

[[John Jacob Astor]] was a merchant of [[New York City]] and founder of the [[American Fur Company]]. To create a chain of trading stations spread across the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the [[Pacific Northwest]], he incorporated an AFC subsidiary, the Pacific Fur Company.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=7-10}} The commercial venture was originally designed to last for twenty years.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=7-10}} Unlike its major competitor the Canadian owned NWC, the Pacific Fur Company was not a [[Joint-stock company]]. Capital for the PFC amounted to $200,000 divided into 100 shares individually valued at $2,000 and was funded entirely by Astor.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=7-10}} The American Fur Company held half of the stock and the other half divided among prospective management and clerks. The chief representative of Astor in the daily operations was [[Wilson Price Hunt]], a [[St. Louis]] businessman with no outback experience who received five shares.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=7-10}} Each working partner was assigned four shares with the remaining shares held in reserve for hired clerks. Fellow partners in the venture were recruited from the NWC, the members being [[Alexander MacKay (fur trader)|Alexander McKay]], [[David Stuart (fur trader)|David Stuart]], [[Duncan McDougall (fur trader)|Duncan McDougall]], and [[Donald Mackenzie (explorer)|Donald Mackenzie]]. Astor and the partners met in New York on 23 June 1810 to sign the Pacific Fur Company's provisional agreement.{{sfn|Irving|1836|pp=26-27}}

To establish the fledgling PFC trade posts in the distant Oregon Country, Astor's plan called for an extensive movement of large groups of employees overland following the route of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] and navally by sailing around [[Cape Horn]]. The venture was planned on methods used in the AFC for the collection of fur pelts. Complements of employees (later called "Astorians"){{sfn|Irving|1836|p=151}} would operate in various parts of the region to complete trapping excursions. Outposts maintained by the PFC would be freighted necessary foodstuffs and supplies by annual cargo ships from New York City.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=7-10}} Trade goods for the [[Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest|Pacific Northwest Indigenous]] such as beads and blankets would be exchanged for fur pelts.

Ongoing supply issues faced by the [[Russian-American Company]] were seen as a means to gain more furs.{{sfn|Wheeler|1971}} Cargo ships en route from the Columbia were planned to then sail north for [[Russian America]] to bring much needed provisions. By cooperating with Russian colonial authorities to strengthen their material presence in Russian America, it was hoped by Astor to stop the NWC or any other British presence to be established upon the Pacific Coast.{{sfn|Tikhmenev|1978|pp=116-118}} A tentative agreement for merchant vessels owned by Astor to ship furs gathered in Russian America into the Qing Empire was signed in 1812.{{sfn|Wheeler|1971}} Company ships then were directed to sail to the port of Guangzhou, where furs were then sold for impressive profits. Chinese products like [[Chinese ceramics|porcelain]], [[nankeen]]s and [[tea]] were to be purchased; with the ships then to cross the [[Indian Ocean]] and head for European and American markets to sell the Chinese wares.

==Labor recruitment==
The PFC required a sizable number of laborers, fur trappers and in particular [[Voyageurs]] to staff company locations. Recruiting for the company's two expeditions were led by Wilson Hunt and Donald Mackenzie for the overland party and Alexander McKay for the naval bound group.{{sfn|Englebert|Teasdale|2013|pp=185-189}}{{sfn|Watson|2010|pp=654-655}} All three men were based out of [[Montreal]] throughout May to July 1810. Hunt was designated to lead the Overland Expedition, despite his inexperience in dealing with Indigenous cultures, or residing in the wilderness. It was suggested that Hunt instead trade positions with McKay and travel on the ''Tonquin''.{{sfn|Porter|1931|p=183}} However, it was determined to keep Hunt in charge of the land party.

The customary time for free agents to be sent into the interior from Montreal was in May, leaving few men left in the city available for hire. The recruitment effort stalled in part from the bitter treatment by the NWC and Hunt's lack of prior experience as a fur merchant, the source of many issues later on.{{sfn|Englebert|Teasdale|2013|pp=185-189}} PFC contracts were atypically favorable for hired men when compared to its Montreal competitors. Terms included a forty percent larger annual salary, double the cash advanced prior to departure and a length of service lasting five years, rather than the more common two or three year employment.{{sfn|Englebert|Teasdale|2013|pp=185-189}}

===McKay's efforts===
[[File:Montreal,_1812_-_Thomas_Davies.jpg|thumb|300px|Montreal was the first location men were hired by the PFC, made difficult in part from opposition from the rival North West Company.]]

During the summer of 1810, Alexander McKay hired thirteen French-Canadians for the ''Tonquin''.{{sfn|Watson|2010|pp=190, 234, 389, 485, 551, 553, 566, 583, 698, 713, 779, 838, 840-841}} The majority of the group remained in Montreal until late July, when they given directives to withdraw to New York City. A canoe provided transportation for the trip down the [[Richelieu River]] and [[Lake Champlain]].{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=23-32}} At [[Whitehall, New York|Whitehall]] additional men that were employed by McKay joined the southbound party, among them [[Ovide de Montigny]].{{sfn|Watson|2010|p=698}} On 3 August they reached New York City, with the group's "hats decorated with parti-colored ribands and feathers..." causing some Americans to believe them to Natives.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=23-32}} The following day lodgings at [[Long Island]] were reached and the scene was described by clerk [[Gabriel Franchère]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We sang as we rowed; which, joined to the unusual sight of a birch bark canoe impelled by nine stout Canadians, dark as Indians, and as gayly adorned, attracted a crowd upon the wharves to gaze at us as we glided along."{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=23-32}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; While waiting to depart for the Pacific, McKay met with British diplomatic official [[Francis James Jackson]]. The official assured McKay that in the event of war between the United States and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], all PFC employees that were British employees would be treated as such.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=23-32}}

===Hunt's efforts===
[[File:Fort Mackinack.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Fort Mackinac was a center of the Great Lakes regional fur trade]]

Thirteen men signed contracts in Montreal to join Hunt on the journey to the Pacific coast by land. Notably only one had previously operated under a contract lasting longer than a year. The generous cash advancements were taken advantage by three men who deserted before Hunt and the remaining group left the city for [[Michilimackinac]] in July.{{sfn|Englebert|Teasdale|2013|pp=185-189}} The party reached [[Mackinac Island]] on 28 July 1810.{{sfn|Englebert|Teasdale|2013|pp=185-189}} Acting as a major depot for the regional [[Great Lakes]] fur trade, the island was where Hunt focused on hiring more men for the company. The veteran fur merchant [[Ramsay Crooks]] was convinced to join the company and assisted in recruiting additional men. Over the sixteen days spent there, a total seventeen men were recruited to the concern with sixteen being [[French-Canadian]].{{sfn|Englebert|Teasdale|2013|pp=190-198}} This group of men, unlike those hired in Montreal, had extensive experience working in the fur trade as [[voyageurs]] and other roles. Likely suggested by Crooks, interested men already hired by other companies would have their contracts purchased from their employers.{{sfn|Englebert|Teasdale|2013|pp=190-198}}

After the men were finally gathered in early August, Hunt and the party departed for St. Louis and arrived there on 3 September. The hired voyageurs and fur trappers completed many transactions with various merchants in St. Louis and in the nearby French-Canadian settlement of [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] throughout September and October. These were recorded on the company ledger and particular purchases been argued as the men collecting goods to trade with various Indigenous nations they would visit.{{sfn|Englebert|Teasdale|2013|pp=190-198}} In particular, these negotiations by the French-Canadians have been thought to be steps towards later establishing themselves as independent traders in relatively unexploited fur regions.{{sfn|Englebert|Teasdale|2013|pp=185-189}} Most of the men in the Overland Party were engaged as hunters, interpreters, guides and voyageurs.

==Oceanic component==
The advanced party was sent to create the initial base of operations at the [[River mouth|mouth]] of the Columbia River. Necessary trade goods for deals with Indigenous and needed supplies to establish the station were shipped on the same vessel In addition to beginning the company headquarters, this party would block any attempts by the NWC to create a station in the area. The ship ''[[Tonquin (1807)|Tonquin]]'' was purchased by Astor in 1810 to start commercial operations on the Pacific Ocean. The majority of the company partners. [[Duncan McDougall (fur trader)|Duncan McDougall]], David and [[Robert Stuart (explorer)|Robert Stuart]], and [[Alexander MacKay (fur trader)|Alexander McKay]] would head this detachment. In addition, clerks [[Gabriel Franchère]] and [[Alexander Ross (fur trader)|Alexander Ross]] would join them on the planned voyage.

===The ''Tonquin''===
{{main|Tonquin (1807)}}
[[File:Tonquin (1807).png|thumb|300px|The ''Tonquin'' being boarded by [[Tla-o-qui-aht]] after Captain [[Jonathan Thorn|Thorn]] assaulted a local noble late in 1811. The clash would destroy the ship along with the entire crew, leaving Fort Astoria without extensive supplies until the following year.]]

Under the command of [[Jonathan Thorn]] the ''Tonquin'' left New York on September 8, 1810.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=23-32}} PFC employees numbered thirty-three men in total on board. The vessel landed at the [[Falkland Islands]] on 4 December to make repairs and take on water supplies at [[Port Egmont]]. Captain Thorn attempted to abandon eight of the crew still on shore, among them clerks Gabriel Franchère and Alexander Ross.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=41-49}}{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=19-26}} The stranded men were taken on board after Robert Stuart threatened to kill Thorn. Communication between company workers was no longer held in English to keep the captain excluded from discussions. Company partners held talks in their ancestral [[Scottish Gaelic]] and the laborers used [[Canadian French]]. On December 25 the ''Tonquin'' rounded [[Cape Horn]] and sailed north into the [[Pacific Ocean]].

The ship anchored at the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] in February 1811.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=52-55}} Due to the possibility of men abandoning their posts to live in the tropical islands, Thorn assembled all of the crew and PFC employees to harass them to remain on the ship.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=31-32}} Commercial transactions with Hawaiians saw the crew purchasing [[cabbage]], [[sugar cane]], [[Dioscorea alata|purple yams]], [[taro]], [[coconut]]s, [[watermelon]], [[breadfruit]], hogs, goats, two sheep,{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=81-86}} and poultry in return for "glass beads, iron rings, needles, cotton cloth".{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=31-32}}{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=52-55}} Upon entering [[Honolulu]], the crew was greeted by [[Isaac Davis (Hawaii)|Isaac Davis]] and [[Francisco de Paula Marín]], the latter acting an interpreter in negotiations with [[Kamehameha I]] and prominent government official [[Kalanimoku]].{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=63-64}} 24 [[Native Hawaiian]] [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanakas]] were hired with the approval of Kamehameha I, who appointed [[Naukane]] to oversee their interests.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=81-86}}

The Columbia River was reached in March 1811. Despite stormy conditions, over several days Thorn ordered two boats dispatched to scout a safe route over the treacherous [[Columbia Bar]]. Both boats would capsize and eight men lost their lives.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=81-86}} Finally on March 24, the ''Tonquin'' crossed the bar, passing into the Columbia’s [[estuary]] and laid anchor in [[Youngs Bay|Baker’s Bay]]. Captain Thorn stressed the urgency for the ''Tonquin'' to start trading further north along the Pacific Coast as instructed by Astor. After 65 days on the Columbia River, the ''Tonquin'' departed with a crew of 23 with McKay was aboard the ship as [[supercargo]]. At [[Vancouver Island]] she was boarded by the [[Tla-o-qui-aht]] people of [[Clayoquot Sound]], where Thorn caused an uproar by hitting a Tla-o-qui-aht noble with a pelt. In the ensuing conflict all of men brought on the ''Tonquin'' were killed besides an interpreter from the [[Quinault people|Quinault]] nation and the ship was destroyed. This put the occupants of Fort Astoria in a tough position, having no access to seaborne transport until the following year.{{sfn|Porter|1931|pp=201-202}}

===Fort Astoria===
{{main|Fort Astoria}}
[[Image:Franchere fort astoria 1813.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Fort Astoria two years after its foundation]]

Construction on [[Fort Astoria]], an "emporium of the west",{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=71-75}} began in the middle of April 1811. It was built upon Point George, the location being about {{convert|5|mi|0}} from the Lewis and Clark Expedition winter camp of [[Fort Clatsop]].{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=99-108}} The terrain and thick forests made clearing a foundation exceedingly difficult. Late in the month, McDougall reported that there was "little progress in clearing, the place being so full of half decayed trunks, large fallen timber &amp; thick brush."{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=9-17}} No one among the party had previous experience in the logging industry and any hadn't used an axe before in general.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=71-75}} Trees had a layer of hardened resin and were of a massive size. Four men worked as a team on platforms at least eight feet above the ground to effectively cut a tree, with it taking typically two days for a single tree to be felled. Medical issues quickly became another major issue for the party as there was not a single medical officer among the passengers brought on the ''Tonquin''.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=71-75}} This left treatments rudimentary at best. During the initial months on the Columbia River at any time upwards of half of the expedition was unable to perform manual labor due to illness.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=71-75}}

===Fort Okanogan===
{{main|Fort Okanogan}}
[[File:Fort Okanogan.tif|thumb|300px|[[Fort Okanogan]] was the second station opened, intended to compete against near by NWC posts.]]

[[Kaúxuma Núpika]], a [[Two-Spirit]] from the [[Ktunaxa]] people, and his wife arrived at Fort Astoria on 15 June 1811 with a letter from [[John Stuart (explorer)|John Stuart]].{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=119-120}} Kaúxuma offered accounts of the interior and recommended that the station be opened at the [[confluence]] of the Columbia and "the [[Okanogan River|Okannaakken River]]"{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=50-51}} among the [[Syilx]] peoples.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=30-35}} It was determined that [[David Stuart (fur trader)|David Stuart]] would take a party to with Kaúxuma to the Syilx. Before they left however the inhabitants of Astoria were surprised by the arrival of [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] on 15 July.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=119-120}} Thompson later stated that his group "set off on a voyage down the Columbia River to explore this river in order to open out a passage for the interior trade with the Pacific Ocean."{{sfn|Thompson|1916|p=473}} The competing fur traders were cordially received at Astoria.

A party of eight led by [[David Stuart (fur trader)|David Stuart]] departed on 22 July for the Syilx territories. The personnel assigned to join Stuart were eight men, including [[Alexander Ross (fur trader)|Alexander Ross]], [[François Benjamin Pillet]], [[Ovide de Montigny]], and [[Naukane]].{{sfn|McDougall|1999|p=35}}{{sfn|Ross|1849|p=115}} The group joined David Thompson and his eight men in traveling up the Columbia, staying together until [[the Dalles, Oregon|the Dalles]]. Upon entering [[Watlala]] [[Chinookan peoples|Chinookan]] territory, Stuart failed establish favorable relations with them. Watlala men performed several military displays and stole a small amount of goods.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=124-128}} Naukane agreed to join the NWC shortly after this episode and the two parties separated.{{sfn|Thompson|1916|pp=510-511}} Stuart was able to secure the protection of [[Wasco-Wishram]] leadership in early August. Groups of Chinookan laborers were used to cross the portages of the Columbia in their homeland.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=124-128}}

Stuart's party soon began to travel through the [[Sahaptin]] nations and on the 12th of August an assembly of [[Walla Walla people|Walla Walla]], [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] and [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]] welcomed the fur traders.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=137-146}} Once the reception was complete, the PFC men continued up the Columbia and passed by the future site of [[Fort Nez Percés]]. Towards the end of August the party began to become troubled with [[Crotalus viridis viridis|Western Rattlesnake]] populations and rapids, almost losing one canoe and the men aboard it to a section of swift currents.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=137-146}} Stuart and his men were greeted by [[Wenatchi]] leadership at the [[Wenatchee River]], who gave two horses to the fur traders as a gift in addition to several more being purchased. While passing through other Indigenous homelands the PFC continued financial dealings for food supplies. Members of the [[Chelan tribe|Chelan nation]] traded "some salmon, roots, and berries" and later [[Methow people|Methows]] offered their "abundance of salmon" and "many horses" to the fur trappers for sale.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=137-146}}

While at the junction of the Columbia and [[Okanogan River]], a large encampment of [[Syilx]] were encountered. Prominent members of the nation entreated the fur traders to resided among their people, proclaiming "themselves to be always be our friends, to kill us plenty of beavers, to furnish us at all times with provisions, and to ensure our protection and safety."{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=151-159}} The cargo of the canoes were taken to land on 1 September and work soon began on Fort Okanogan. A residence crafted from driftwood acquired from the Okanogan River. While construction of the post was ongoing, four men that included Pillet were detailed to inform the progress of inland trade. The party arrived back at the company headquarters on 11 October and gave its favorable report.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|p=51}}

Stuart led Montigny and two other men to follow the course of the Okanogan, leaving only Ross at the post. As promised, the Syilx provided security for the station, frequently alerting Ross when intruders from other nations came near.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=151-159}} Despite planning on exploring the Okanogan watershed for a month, Stuart and his three men did not return until 22 March 1812. Upon reaching the Okanogan headwaters the party then went over to the [[Thompson River]]. Snows in mountain passes made it exceedingly difficult for the party to travel. Detained among the [[Secwepemc]], Stuart developed cordial relations with them. Finding their areas rich in beaver populations, he promised to return later that year to create a trading post.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=151-159}}

==The Lower Chinookan peoples==
{{main|Chinookan peoples}}
[[File:Portrait of Chief Comcomly.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Comcomly]]'s mercantile skills as an [[intermediary]] gained him significant profits in deals with Fort Astoria. In particular he controlled the sale of many of the pelts originating from the Chinookan, [[Chehalis people|Chehalis]] and [[Quinault people|Quinault]] nations.
{{sfn|Boyd|Kenneth|Johnson|2015|p=263}}]]

Diplomatic relationships with the Chinookan villages near the Columbia were critical for the viability of Fort Astoria. Scholars have affirmed that the American company and its "economic success depended on mutually beneficial economic exchanges with Indian groups... who controlled trade."{{sfn|Boyd|Kenneth|Johnson|2015|p=263}} Many of the settlements near the station were under the influence of headman [[Comcomly]].

===Assistance in exploration===
Chinookans were highly important in company explorations of the Pacific Coast. In particular, they were instrumental in finding a suitable location for what became Fort Astoria. In early April 1811 McDougall and David Stuart visited Comcomly, who advised them not to return to the Columbia River as it was then quite tumultuous. The two men didn't listen and shortly afterward their canoe capsized in the river. The "timely succor" of Comcomly and his villagers ensured the partners were saved before they drowned.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=99-108}} After recuperating there for three days, they returned to the PFC camp.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=9-17}}

Additional services tendered was the relaying information from more distant peoples to the Astorians. Reports were circulated by them in late April 1811 of a trade post maintained by white men in the interior.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=9-17}} This was correctly conjectured by PFC employees to be their NWC rivals,{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=99-108}} later found to be [[Spokane House]]. Departing on 2 May, McKay led Robert Stuart, Franchère, [[Ovide de Montigny]] and a number of voyaguers up the Columbia, with [[Clatsop people|Clatsop]] noble [[Coalpo]] acting as guide and interpreter. The following day they explored the [[Cowlitz River]] and soon encountered a large canoe flotilla of [[Cowlitz people|Cowlitz]] warriors. McKay was able to request a parlay, during which the Cowlitz stated they were armed for combat against the nearby Skilloot Chinookan village near the river mouth.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=99-108}} Reaching the Dalles on 10 May, no trade station was found at the important fishery. Due to Coalpo's fear of reprisal from his enemies among the [[Wasco-Wishram|Wasco and Wishram]], the party went back to Fort Astoria, returning on 14 May.

Despite not finding the NWC post, management at Fort Astoria soon became "anxious to acquire a knowledge of the country &amp; the prospects of trade... within our reach".{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=21-27}} On 6 June 1811, Robert Stuart went north on a tour of western [[Olympic Peninsula]] with Calpo acting as a guide again. Returning on 24 June, Stuart reported that the [[Quinault people|Quinault]] and nearby [[Quileute]] nations would kill [[Sea otter]]s and trade their pelts for the valuable [[Dentalium shell]]s sold by the [[Nuu-chah-nulth]] on [[Vancouver Island]].{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=21-27}} Stuart felt that a company trade post in [[Grays Harbor]] offered the best location to secure these furs. Additionally he gave the opinion that [[Alutiiq]] in [[Russian America]] should be recruited to hunt various fur bearing animals at the hypothetical [[Factory (trading post)|factory]].

However, Chinookans were not always willing to help Astorians in visiting distant locations. This was a means of delaying the Astorians from making commercial connections with Indigenous peoples on the Upper Columbia. One particular incident has been described by historian Robert F. Jones as "an effort to keep Comcomly's Chinooks as middlemen between the natives of the upper Columbia and the Astorians."{{sfn|McDougall|1999|p=27 fn. 65}} [[François Benjamin Pillet]] was ordered to make a trading trip along the Columbia. Accompanied by a Chinook headman, they left Fort Astoria in late June 1811. Small trade deals were completed with Skilloots near modern [[Oak Point, Washington|Oak Point]]. Afterwards, the headman cited the seasonal flooding as making the Columbia unsafe to travel further upriver. This forced Pillet to return to Astoria with what pelts he had purchased from the Skilloots.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=21-27}}

===Commercial ties===
[[File:Hat, Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka), British Columbia, Canada, c. 1904, No. 1904.19.0186 - Etnografiska museet - Stockholm, Sweden - DSC01088.JPG|thumb|200px|A [[Nuu-chah-nulth]] hat, similar to those crafted by Chinookans that were often sold to PFC laborers.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|p=77, fn. 167}}]]

Consistently small stockpiles of foodstuffs at Fort Astoria created the need for frequent transactions with Chinookans for sustenance. Seasonal fish runs provided the major nutritional sources for the Columbian River-based Natives. After ceremonial rituals during each major [[Salmon run|fish run]], trade for caught fish would begin in earnest with the Astorians. A constant task for Hawaiians would be to perform fisherman duties.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=72-78}} Major fish populations active in the Columbia included the [[Eulachon|Candlefish smelt]], [[White sturgeon]], [[Sockeye salmon]] and [[Chinook salmon]]. This dependence on fish made it a primary food source for the Astorians, which caused some discontent among employees desiring a more familiar diet.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=71-75}}{{sfn|Franchère|1854|p=125}}

Terrestrial animals like members of the family Cervidae such as [[Roosevelt elk]] and [[black-tailed deer]] were not found in large numbers around Fort Astoria.{{sfn|Ronda|1990|p=221}} This made them another important source of trade for the Chinookans when visiting the PFC station. Another frequent item sold when fish supplies were low in the winter was the [[Sagittaria latifolia|Wapato root]]. Wapato provided a common source of calories for Chinookans and other nations. The Astorians described the tuber as "a good substitute for potatoes"{{sfn|Franchère|1854|p=162}} Purchases of Wapato occurred in such volumes that a small cellar had to be created specifically to house the produce. Other typical purchases from Chinookans included manufactured goods. In particular woven hats were frequently bought for protection against the seasonal rains.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=72-78}} These hats were tightly interwoven, making them essentially waterproof. Of benefit to the Astorians was that they were typically wide enough to cover the shoulders. Ross described the common artwork depicted them as "chequered" with various animal designs that were "not painted, but ingeniously interwoven."{{sfn|Ross|1849|p=89}}

Chinookans near Fort Astoria employed various means of retaining their valuable middle man position between various neighboring Indigenous peoples and the PFC. Additional tactics involved manipulating the perception neighboring Natives had of the American company. In August 1811, a small party of [[Chehalis people|Chehalis]] visited Fort Astoria. In dialogue with them McDougall inquired why they would rarely directly trade with the PFC. The Chehalis merchants responded that Chinooks affiliated with Comcomly claimed that the Astorians were "very inveterate against their nation."{{sfn|McDougall|1999|p=44}} McDougall concluded this story was used by Comcomly to continue his commercial hegemony over the area.

===Fear of hostilities===
It wasn't always that the Astorians, especially McDougall trusted Comcomly or Chinookans in general. His judgment of them, despite eventually marrying a daughter of Comcomly was that they were often ready to attack the fort. In particular Jones noted that he "seems to place implicit faith in any possible hostile actions by the natives."{{sfn|McDougall|1999|p=115}}

In June 1812, the number of men at Fort Astoria were reduced to 11 Hawaiians and 39 European descendants.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=100-102}} Fear of attack by Chinookans was high and drills were directed by McDougall frequently. A delegation of Chinookans visited Fort Astoria on 2 July quickly left after witnessing these military demonstrations. This fear by the natives convinced the Astorians that "they are not friendly disposed towards us..." having "a desire to harm us."{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=100-102}} According to Jones, this "latent distrust" of Chinookans by Astorians from this incident was probably unfounded, as they entered the post "for an innocent purpose" and were frightened by the drills.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=100-102 fn.}}

Fears of attack didn't disappear and Astorians kept themselves guarded in dealing with natives. After the ''[[Beaver (1805)|Beaver]]'' left for [[Russian America]] rumors spread of a coming attack on Astoria in August 1812. There were large numbers of Chinookans and Chehalis near Comcomly's village at the time. This expedited construction on two [[bastion]]s and the fort was "put in readiness for an attack."{{sfn|McDougall|1999|p=113}} Jones has pointed out that these movements of Indigenous was very likely a part of seasonal fishing, rather than a supposed hostile gathering.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|p=113 fn.}}

==Overland Expedition==
As the leader of the expedition Hunt would make a number of decisions which were disastrous.{{sfn|Porter|1931|pp=201-202}} The movement of Hunt's group has been described as "a company of traders forging westward in [a] haphazard fashion."{{sfn|Morris|2013|p=xv}}  He ordered the expedition to leave St. Louis just before the winter to reduce company expenses of supporting employees.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=10-14}} The group departed on October 21, 1810 for [[Fort Osage]]. The expedition traveled {{convert|450|mile|-1}} up the [[Missouri River]] before setting up winter camp on [[Nodaway Island]], at the mouth of [[Nodaway River]] in [[Andrew County, Missouri]], just north of [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]]. French-Canadian employees made frequent purchases from the company store during the idle season, especially those hired at Michilimackinac. Small items like blue beads, [[vermilion]], brass rings, tobacco "carrots", small axes among others were used in transactions with [[Missouria]] neighboring the camp.{{sfn|Englebert|Teasdale|2013|pp=190-198}}

On January 1811,{{sfn|Morris|2013|p=75}} Hunt sailed down the Missouri River to complete several pending transactions at St. Louis.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=10-14}} It was during this time he recruited [[Pierre Dorion Jr.]], as he was the only qualified speaker of the [[Sioux language]]s in St. Louis at the time.{{sfn|Morris|2013|p=75}} Notably he was in debt to [[Manuel Lisa]] and the [[Missouri Fur Company]] (MFC), something that would lead to tensions between the fur companies later in the year. In the end Hunt was able to secure Dorion, on the condition that Marie and his two children be brought along as well. Once finalized, he took British naturalists [[John Bradbury (naturalist)|John Bradbury]] and [[Thomas Nuttall]] with him to the Nodaway camp, as previously agreed upon. The party left St. Louis on 12 March and reached Fort Osage on the 8th of April.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=35-36}} Early into the travel Dorion physically abused his wife and caused her to flee for a day.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=10-14}} At the station Ramsay Crooks was waiting for them and the group recuperated for two days. The group left Fort Osage on the 10th of April and during the day Dorion "severely beat his squaw" as Marie desired to stay with newly made [[Osage Nation|Osage]] acquaintances rather than continue with the expedition. The group reached the winter camp on the 17th.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=43-54}} The overland group at this point amounted to almost sixty men, forty being French-Canadian voyageurs.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=43-54}}

===Following the Missouri===
[[File:Sioux-Encampment-1024x768.jpg|300px|thumb|left|A Sioux village. Many of the Plains nations visited by the expedition had similar dwellings.]]

Hunt's expedition broke the Nodaway winter camp on April 21.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=43-54}} The Astorians reached a major [[Omaha people|Omaha]] village in early May. Active commercial transactions were completed there, with Omaha merchants offering "jerked buffalo meat, tallow, corn, and marrow" for vermilion, beads and tobacco carrots.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=65-69}} Bradbury detailed that the Omaha village had plots of [[nicotiana rustica]], melons, beans, squashes, and corn under cultivation. While at the Omaha settlement, Hunt received information from several visiting [[Yankton Sioux Tribe|Yankton Sioux]] that a group of [[Sioux]] was gathering further up the river to stop the expedition from traveling further.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=65-69}}

Proceeding further the Missouri River, the Sioux party was encountered on 31 May. The Sioux bands were a conglomeration of Yankton and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and had around six hundred armed men.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=82-85}} Tensions quickly arose between the two disparate groups and both took up positions by the Missouri River. The two company [[howitzer]]s and single [[Swivel gun]] were loaded with powder and fired to intimidate the Sioux bands. The artillery were then loaded with live ammunition, but the Sioux across the river began to "spread their buffalo robes before them, and moved them side to side."{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=82-85}} Dorion stopped the firing of the armaments a second time, as he understood this action by the Sioux meant they desired a parley. Peace talks were held and the Sioux explained that they had formed to prevent the PFC from trading with the neighboring nations they were at war with, the [[Arikara]], [[Mandan]] and the [[Gros Ventre]].{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=82-85}} Hunt explained that the expedition intended to travel to the Pacific Ocean and they had no interest in the neighboring Indigenous groups. This was found to be acceptable by the Sioux leaders, and the PFC was allowed to depart further north.

On 3 June, employees of the Missouri Fur Company under the command of Manuel Lisa were encountered on the Missouri River.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=97-116}} Lisa reminded Dorion of his pending debt to the company, and a duel between the two men was narrowly averted by Bradbury and [[Henry Marie Brackenridge]] intervening.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=97-116}} After this incident the rival fur companies refrained from interacting and camped on opposite sides of the Missouri River. Despite this, Lisa and Hunt led their parties north towards an Arikara village and reached it on 12 June. In a council with local leadership Lisa declared that if any of Hunt's party were harmed he'd take it as an offense against him as well.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=97-116}} In setting the standard rate for purchasing horses, "carbines, powder, ball, tomahawks knives" were in high demand as the Arikara were planning an attack upon the Sioux.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|pp=97-116}} Lisa and Hunt made a deal allowing for Hunt's boats to be exchanged for additional horses, kept at [[Fort Lisa (North Dakota)|Fort Lisa]] further up the Missouri River.{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|p=122}} Crooks was sent with a small group to fetch the horses and while they reached Fort Lisa on the 23rd, they had to wait until the 25th for Lisa to arrive to finalize the transaction. The party left the following day and returned south to Hunt's camp.

===The Rocky Mountains===
[[File:Six Blackfeet Chiefs - Paul Kane.jpg|thumb|275px|The military prowess of the various [[Niitsitapi]] peoples deterred the Overland party from continuing to follow the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition's path up the Missouri River.]]

While at the Arikara village, Hunt met and employed several American trappers that had previously worked for the MFC in modern [[Idaho]]. The men advised strongly against going into the [[Piikáni]] homelands of modern [[Montana]].{{sfn|Bradbury|1817|p=226}} The Piikáni and other [[Niitsitapi]] nations at the time were typically unreceptive to trespass from European descendants and made a showing of military force against the Lewis and Clark Expedition. This changed Hunt's plans, who according determined it best to avoid the Niitsitapi peoples.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=144-151}}

The expedition left their Arikara hosts in late July for the nearby [[Grand River (South Dakota)|Grand River]]. After following the [[Little Missouri River (North Dakota)|Little Missouri River]], the party to rest for several days while transactions were made with a band of [[Cheyenne]].{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=19-28}} In total 36 horses were purchased from the Cheyenne. The expedition broke camp on 6 August and Hunt ordered six men to hunt [[Bison]]. Hunt's party continued southwest through the modern state of [[Wyoming]] and the hunting party rejoined on the 18th of August, having killed 8 Bison.{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=19-28}} While at the base of [[Cloud Peak]] on 30 August, a scouting party of [[Apsáalooke]] visited the camp. The following day a delegation of Apsáalooke on horseback invited them to visit their nearby village. Hunt recalled the importance of mercantile deals with the Apsáalooke stating that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We spent the first day of September buying some robes and belts and trading our tired, maimed horses for fresh ones... thereby augmenting the number of our horses to about 121, most of which were well-trained and able to cross the mountains."{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=19-28}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Continuing westward towards the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]], the PFC party followed the course of the [[Wind River (Wyoming)|Wind River]], crossed the Divide and followed the [[Gros Ventre River]].

===Snake River===
[[File:Shoshone Falls, Snake River, Idaho ppmsca.10072u.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Features of the Snake River such as the [[Shoshone Falls]] would prove to be a major challenge for the Overland Party to pass.]]

The expedition reached Fort Henry on 8 September,{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=32-40}} made by MFC employee [[Andrew Henry (fur trader)|Andrew Henry]] the previous year, near present-day [[St. Anthony, Idaho|St. Anthony]] and made a camp there. The post was and was later abandoned. While at the location work began creating enough canoes necessary to take the party down [[Henrys Fork (Snake River)|Henry's Fork]] and later the [[Snake River]] or so called "Mad River"{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=32-40}} to the Columbia. This was done as it felt no longer necessary to travel with pack horses, a decision that would soon cause more issues for the party.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=144-151}} On the 10th, four men and two Natives under the command of Joseph Miller departed to begin trapping in the area.{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=32-40}} The horses that remained in the possession of the PFC, amounting to seventy-seven, were left in the care of "two young [[Snake Indian|Snakes]]".{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=32-40}} The party departed from Fort Henry on 19 September on the newly made canoes.

Traveling down the Snake River proved highly difficult due to the many rapids such as [[Caldron Linn (Idaho)|Caldron Linn]]. The party was forced to perform multiple [[portage]]s due to these fierce currents. Over course of the remainder of September through early November, four incidents of canoes capsizing killed one man meant major losses in trade goods and food supplies.{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=32-40}} In addition to the hardships caused from attempting to follow the course of the Snake more problems arose due to dwindling food stockpiles. By 31 October there was enough provisions to last for five days.{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=32-40}} In early November there were not many animals in the area to gather for food, the few that were caught by the hunting parties were beaver. The traveling partners agreed to end travel by canoe, finding the mode of transportation too difficult continue using.{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=32-40}} Hunt ordered several groups go in various directions to contact neighboring Indigenous for material support. In the meantime the PFC expedition began to deposit its trade goods in small caches to lighten the workload of the men.

At the suggestion of Ramsay Crooks, the expedition was divided into two parties of nineteen men each, with each member receiving 5&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; pounds of dried meat. A third small group was led by [[Donald Mackenzie (explorer)|Donald MacKenzie]] to reach Fort Astoria ahead of the main contingent. All that remained in the company stores was "forty pounds of corn, twenty of fat, and nearly five pounds of bouillon tablets."{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=32-40}} On 9 November the two groups began traveling on either side of the Snake. Soon the cliffs became too steep to allow an easy descent to the river banks for water. Sources of hydration became very limited and despite intercourse with several groups of Indigenous the situation didn't improve. Water was collected on 20 November after it rained the previous night. Up to that point "several Canadians had begun to drink their urine" in desperation.{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=43-51}}

Crooks reunited with Hunt's party in early December alone. Crooks was so weakened from starvation that his pace would have slowed the expedition immensely. Hunt left two men to tend to Crooks while the main group pushed forward. Several villages of [[Northern Shoshone]] were visited and vitally needed food sources such as horses along with "some dried fish, a few roots, and some pounded dried cherries" were purchased.{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=43-51}} A Shoshone was convinced to act as a scout to guide the PFC group to the [[Umatilla River]]. On 23 December, thirteen men assigned to Crooks party were met who gave the unfortunate news that they hadn't seen him since he left Hunt's group.{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=43-51}}

===Reaching the Columbia===
[[File:Columbia_River,_Washington,_ca_1913_(BAR_222).jpeg|left|thumb|upright=1.30|The [[Cascade Rapids]] on the Columbia River.]]

Donald Stuart and his party of [[Robert McClellan (fur trader)|Robert McClellan]], [[John Reed (fur trader)|John Reed]], [[Étienne Lucier]]{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=72-78}} and seven other men continued to march ahead of the two main PFC groups. While traversing the lands of the [[Niimíipu]], a stranded employee of the PFC, [[Archibald Pelton]], was found and brought along with the party.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=144-151}} They finally arrived at Fort Astoria on 18 January 1812. The party was described as clothed in "nothing but fluttering rags."{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=144-151}} While waiting for the main contingent under Hunt to arrive, the men informed the personnel of the overland journey's progress from St. Louis.

Hunt's group found a band of [[Liksiyu]] on 8 January, whom hosted the downtrodden expedition for a week.{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=53-63}} Meals of dried [[Mule deer]] meat and loafs of pounded [[Camassia|Camas bulbs]] were provided during their stay. While exploring the area, Hunt found out from particular Liksiyu that there was an active white fur trader in the area. This would turn out to be [[Jacques Raphaël Finlay]], located at the NWC [[Spokane House]].{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=53-63}} On 21 January, the expedition finally reached the banks of the Columbia River. Hunt soon entered discussions with the [[Wasco-Wishram]] when entering their villages. It was here he learned the destruction of the ''Tonquin'' the previous year.{{sfn|Hunt|1973|pp=53-63}} The remaining three horses of the party were used to purchase two canoes from Wasco merchants. Several portages were required on the Columbia, especially at the [[Cascade Rapids]]. The main body of the expedition reached Fort Astoria on 15 February to much fanfare. Besides Hunt there was thirty men, along with [[Marie Aioe Dorion]] and her two children on six canoes.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=72-78}} McDougall was apprehensive about feeding all these additional people, a sentiment Franchère shared,{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=144-151}} as the post had recently faced issues with provisions.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=72-78}} Due to seasonal salmon runs harvested by various Chinookans however, there was a sizable food supply at Fort Astoria.

==Activities in 1812==

===Attempted expedition to interior===
In late March, three clerks in command of fourteen men were ordered to depart for the hinterlands. Robert Stuart was take needed trade goods to Fort Okanogan. [[John Reed (fur trader)|John Reed]] was to take food supplies to the stranded Crooks and Day, in addition to later taking dispatches for Astor to St. Louis. [[Russel Farnham]] was to retrieve the caches left by Hunt near Fort Henry.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=186-190}} To complete several of the necessary portages at the Dalles, Wascos were hired to help freight the trade goods. Two bales of trade goods and later some personal items were however stolen.{{sfn|Stuart|1953|pp=59-63}} Stuart ordered his men to complete the portages during the night. A skirmish arose at sunrise between arriving Wascos and Reed, who was defending several bales of goods with one man.{{sfn|Stuart|1953|pp=59-63}} After being grievously injured, Reed lost the box containing the dispatches. Additional PFC arrived at the scene and two natives were reportedly killed in the struggle. The Chinookans returned in larger numbers and armed several hours later. To avoid more bloodshed Stuart was able to negotiate a settlement with the aggrieved families. In return for a reported six blankets{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=186-190}} and tobacco,{{sfn|Stuart|1953|pp=59-63}} the Astorians were able to continue their journey up the Columbia.

The conflict raised security concerns of crossing into further Indigenous nations, forcing the three parties to all travel to Fort Okanogan. Arriving there on the 24th of April, the clerks, voyageurs and trappers departed for Fort Astoria on the 29th, leaving Alexander Ross and two men at the station. Stockpiles of pelts accumulated there amounted to an estimated 2,500 were taken as well. Near the mouth of the [[Umatilla River]] the party was surprised to loudly hear English shouted among an assembled group of Indigenous, perhaps [[Umatilla people|Umatilla]]. Ramsay Crooks and [[John Day (trapper)|John Day]] were there them, exhausted from several months of tribulations. Wandering over a large area, the two men at one point received the help of an Umatilla noble, Yeck-a-tap-am, who "in particular treated us like a father."{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=186-190}} After being robbed by another band of Natives, Crooks and Day were able to find the Umatilla once more. Taking two worn men with them, the party reached Fort Astoria on 11 May.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|p=89}}

===The ''Beaver''===
{{main|Beaver (1805)}}
[[File:Louis Choris - 'Vue du port hanarourou'.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] would for decades provide manpower for visiting naval and fur merchants, including the Pacific Fur Company.]]

The ''Beaver'' was the second supply ship sent by Astor to the Pacific Coast, with Cornelius Sowle as its captain. It sailed from New York City in October 1811 and reached [[Fort Astoria]] on 9 May 1812.{{sfn|Ross|1849|pp=233-235}} While stopping at the Kingdom of Hawaii, more men were recruited as Kanakas for the company. After unloading necessary supplies to the Fort, the ''Beaver'' sailed to Russian America. Hunt joined the crew to negotiate with RAC governor [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov]] at [[New Archangel]]. The cargo was purchased by the Russians amounted to [[Russian ruble|₽]]124,000 in value, with payment in seal skins located on [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island]].{{sfn|Tikhmenev|1978|pp=116-118}} Orders from Astor dictated that the ship to return to the Columbia,{{sfn|Greenhow|1844|p=44}} but the ''Beaver'' was in poor repair and sailed for the Kingdom of Hawaii instead. Hunt was left there as the ''Beaver'' went west to Guangzhou. News of the [[War of 1812]] kept the ship at the port for the remainder of the conflict. The ''Beaver'' then proceeded to New York City and entered the city harbor in 1816.

===Second interior expedition===
[[Image:The Astorians plaque.JPG|thumb|left|A plaque marking the spot along the Snake River in modern Wyoming where Stuart's party had horses stolen from them by a Native raiding party in September 1812.]]

Failure to accomplish many of the tasks set for work the hinterland earlier in 1812 did not discourage the Astorians. The supplies and reinforcements brought aboard the ''Beaver'' made management consider "grander schemes" for the summer.{{sfn|Ronda|1990|pp=240-241}} New establishments would be created to challenge the NWC across the region in addition to pursuing trading expeditions among various Indigenous nations. A total of almost 60 men were directed to locations from the [[Willamette Valley]] of [[Oregon]] to the [[Bitterroot Valley]] of [[Montana]] and the vicinity of modern [[Kamloops]] in [[British Columbia]].{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=100-102 fn.}} The movement of workers to their assigned locales began in late June.{{sfn|McDougall|1999|pp=100–102}} Robert Stuart led a party bound for St. Louis to send information to Astor as Reed had attempted earlier in the year. His group was composed two French-Canadians and four Americans.{{sfn|Stuart|1953|pp=27-29}} John Day became afflicted by mental instability and Stuart paid several [[Multnomah people|Multnomah]] men of Cathlapotle village to transport him back to Fort Astoria.{{sfn|Stuart|1953|pp=46-47}} The group would make the important discovery of the [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]], critical for the later westward movement of tens of thousands of American migrants.

==Liquidation==
Funds provided by Astor established several major trading stations across the Pacific Northwest. While intended to gain control of the regional fur trade, the Pacific Fur Company would ultimately flounder. This came from a variety of issues, many caused by the tumultuous diplomatic relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States. The destruction of the ''Tonquin'' left Fort Astoria under supplied and heavily reliant upon neighboring Chinookans for sustenance. Competition from the interior based North West Company threatened to the loss of major fur producing Oregon Country regions. The Overland Expedition would arrive many months later than planned by Astor. Wilson Hunt's inexperience in the outback in along with dwindling supplies would leave the majority of the expedition facing starvation.

While the arrival of the ''Beaver'' brought much needed trading goods, foodstuffs and additional employees, events would soon see the ending of the PFC. News of the [[War of 1812]] was relayed to the Astorians at Fort Spokane, information that Donald McKenzie brought to Fort Astoria in January 1813. As Franchere recalled, a council of clerks and management noted that the Astorians were "almost to a man British subjects", forcing them to agree to "abandon the establishment" of Fort Astoria and its secondary stations.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=166-167}} A British warship was learned from NWC clerks to be en route to capture the station. The PFC management agreed to sell its assets across the Oregon Country, formalized on 23 October 1813 with the raising of the [[Union Jack]].{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=190-193}} On 30 November {{HMS|Racoon|1808|6}} arrived at the Columbia River and in honor of [[George III of the United Kingdom]] Fort Astoria was renamed Fort George.{{sfn|Franchère|1854|pp=200-201}} On board the ''Racoon'' was [[John MacDonald of Garth|John MacDonald]] who oversaw the formal takeover of PFC properties. Later in March 1814, the NWC's ship {{ship||Isaac Todd|1811 ship|2}} arrived on the Columbia, delivering much-needed supplies to Fort George. She then sailed on to China, and England. She carried some PFC personnel, many of whom were former employees of the NWC, back to England, from where they returned to Montreal.

During a NWC shareholder meeting in July 1814, the partners declared that the sale "greatly facilitated the getting out of the [Pacific] Country our competitors the American Fur Company.{{sfn|William Stewart Wallace|1934|pp=260-261}} They also concluded that the sale of Astoria and other PFC properties gave "considerable" advancements for their company. Plans were considered to use the stations much in the same manner Astor meant, for trade with China. The Columbia also offered a less costly means of supplying the interior NWC posts in the region.{{sfn|William Stewart Wallace|1934|pp=260-261}}

The [[Treaty of 1818]] established a "joint occupancy" of the Pacific Northwest between the United States and the United Kingdom was confirmed, each nation agreeing not to inhibit the activities of each other's citizens. During 1821, the British Government ordered the NWC to be merged in their long time rivals, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. In a short time the HBC controlled the majority of the fur trade across the Pacific Northwest. This was done in a manner that "the Americans were forced to acknowledge that Astor's dream" of a multi-continent economic web "had been realized... by his enterprising and far-sighted competitors."{{sfn|Tikhmenev|1978|p=169}} The PFC held additional influence on the region in some particular and subtle ways. The book [[Astoria (book)|Astoria]] was written by [[Washington Irving]] in 1836, after interviewing some men connected to the venture and consulting documents held by Astor. Two surviving members of the Astorians, [[Étienne Lucier]] and [[Joseph Gervais]], would later become farmers on the [[French Prairie]] and participate in the [[Champoeg Meetings]].

'''Parallel Education''' is a system in which boys and girls in Australia attend the same school, but are split into [[Gender segregation|single sex]] classes for core subjects such as [[English language|English]], [[Maths]], [[science]], [[LOTE]], and [[humanities]]. However, [[student]]s will come together for [[drama]], [[music]] and other social and cultural activities although a strict 30&amp;nbsp;cm personal space rule applies. Theoretically, this means that students will receive the best education while still being able to interact with the opposite sex. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Haileybury College, Melbourne]] currently operates Parallel Education at their five campuses with many other leading schools set to follow.

'''Pieter Jacobsz Olycan''' (1572 &amp;ndash; 1658), was a Dutch brewer, magistrate, and later mayor of [[Haarlem]], best known today for his portraits by [[Frans Hals]], as well as for the portraits of his wife [[Maritge Claesdr. Voogt]].

==Biography==
[[File:Frans Hals - portrait of Pieter Jacobsz Olycan at bust length OS-2004-39.JPG|thumb|Previously assumed to be a copy of the 3/4 length portrait, this smaller panel by Frans Hals is now considered to predate it by 5 years or so.]]
He was a merchant in oils and grains in Amsterdam with a warehouse called "In den Olycan", which became his name. He was also a brewer in Haarlem on the [[Spaarne]] river with a large brewery called the "Vogelstruys".&lt;ref&gt;This was situated on the Donkere Spaarne next to the brewery "De Vos"&lt;/ref&gt; Pieter Olycan was one of three brewers from Haarlem who sold his “Vogelstruys” beer from a 'bierstekerij' on the Bierkade in [[Purmerend]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneindignoordholland.nl/nl-NL/verhaal/810/biertje Story of beer in Purmerend] on [[Oneindig Noord Holland]]&lt;/ref&gt;
He married Maritje Claesdr Voogt and through her he became the brother-in-law to two more brewers of Haarlem. They became the parents of:&lt;ref&gt;Frans Hals: Exhibition on the Occasion of the Centenary of the Municipal Museum at Haarlem, 1862-1962., pp 58-59, publication Frans Hals Museum, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Biesboer&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1mV6p35NufEC&amp;pg=PA8 Collections of paintings in Haarlem, 1572-1745], by P Biesboer; Carol Togneri, Los Angeles, Getty Provenance Index, Getty Research Institute, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieter Olycan was a member of the Haarlem regency and became a magistrate and mayor of Haarlem, and served in the Haarlem Cluveniers Civic guard. He was portrayed by [[Hendrik Gerritsz Pot]] in his [[The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1630|group portrait of the St Adrian Civic Guard in 1630]].

'''Ramón Lopez-Irizarry''' &lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|''' Lopez'''|'''Irizarry'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (July 25, 1897 – October 8, 1982) was an educator and scientist who invented an easier way to extract the cream from the coconut pulp and developed the original formula of [[Coco Lopez|Coco López]].

==Early years==
Ramón López-Irizarry, born in [[Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico]],  was a professor of agricultural sciences at the [[University of Puerto Rico]].  In the late 1940s, the [[Government of Puerto Rico]] gave a grant to the University of Puerto Rico to assist in the development of Puerto Rican  industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0308C&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=6379 ProQuest Historical Newspapers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029075620/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0308c&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=6379 |date=2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coco López==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lata de Coco Lopez.jpg|right|60px|thumb|Can of Coco López]] --&gt;
In 1949, López-Irizarry, with the use of some of these funds, was able to work in his laboratory on an idea that he had. López-Irizarry set out to find an easier way to extract the cream from the coconut pulp. The heart of the coconut has always been an important ingredient in many of the desserts in [[Puerto Rico]].  The main problem was extracting the coconut cream from the pulp which was a difficult task.  López-Irizarry discovered an easier way by blending the cream from the hearts of the [[Caribbean]] coconuts with an exact proportion of natural [[cane sugar]].  He named the product which he developed ''Coco López''.

López-Irizarry kept the ingredients of the product a secret. The project was so successful that López-Irizarry soon left the University and commercialized it. Coco López became the basis for the famous [[piña colada]] drink, which made its first appearance in 1954.  The piña colada is also known as the "Official Beverage of Puerto Rico".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cocolopez.com/cream.html Coco López]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
López-Irizarry was very successful. He packaged his product at the Industrias La Famosa canning factory, owned by [[Wilbert Parkhurst]] and family, for years. In 1966, he sold the brand to the Parkhurst family who later forged a deal with David Ballachow to distribute the product in the United States.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://www.slammedmagazine.com/inthisissue/05mayjune/pinacoladas.html Slammed Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Parkhurst family sold the brand to the [[Borden (company)|Borden]] company. López-Irizarry's Coco López can be found in [[List of supermarkets|supermarkets]] worldwide.

==Personal life==
López-Irizarry was married to Georgina Ramírez-Banuchi and had four children: Rosabel, Myrna, Ramón and Jorge. He resided in Ocean Park, San Juan, where he spent his last years. Ramón López-Irizarry died a multi-millionaire on October 8, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://welcome.topuertorico.org/culture/famousprK-Q.shtml Famous Puerto Ricans]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Truett Cathy''' (March 14, 1921 {{ndash}} September 8, 2014) was an American businessman, investor, author, and philanthropist. He founded the fast food restaurant chain [[Chick-fil-A]].

==Early life==
Cathy was born on March 14, 1921 in [[Eatonton, Georgia]], the son of Lilla James (née Kimball) and Joseph Benjamin Cathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-08/s-truett-cathy-chick-fil-a-s-faith-driven-founder-dies-at-93 | work=Bloomberg | first=Laurence | last=Arnold | title=S. Truett Cathy, Chick-fil-A's Faith-Driven Founder, Dies at 93 | date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Henry W. Grady High School|Boys High School]] (now Henry W. Grady High School) in [[Atlanta]]. Cathy served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. Cathy began the chain in the Atlanta suburb of [[Hapeville, Georgia|Hapeville]] in 1946 with a restaurant called the Dwarf Grill, named because of its small size. It was there that he, along with his brother and business partner Ben, created the chicken sandwich that later became the signature menu item for Chick-fil-A. The original restaurant (since renamed Dwarf House) is still in operation and the company operates other Dwarf House locations in the metro Atlanta area. He married Jeannette and had three children: Trudy, Don "[[Bubba Cathy|Bubba]]", and [[Dan T. Cathy|Dan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathyfamily.com/truett/timeline.aspx#4|title=Cathy Family website|author=The Cathy Family|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cathy was a member of the First Baptist Church in [[Jonesboro, Georgia]], and taught Sunday School there for more than 50 years. He said that the Bible is his guide-book for life.&lt;ref name="easier"&gt;Cathy, S. Truett, ''It's Easier To Succeed Than Fail'', Oliver-Nelson Books (1989); {{ISBN|0-8407-9030-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his strong religious beliefs, all of the company's locations, whether company-owned or franchised, are closed on Sundays to allow its employees to attend church and spend time with their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Media/PDF/ClosedonSundaypolicy.pdf|title=Chick-fil-A's Closed-on-Sunday Policy|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929105406/http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Media/PDF/ClosedonSundaypolicy.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy began when Cathy was working six days a week, multiple shifts. He decided to close on Sundays.&lt;ref name="easier"/&gt;

Cathy wrote five books: the autobiography ''Eat Mor Chikin: Inspire More People'', a motivational book entitled ''It's Easier to Succeed Than to Fail'', the parenting book ''It's Better to Build Boys Than Mend Men'', an explanation of his business success in ''How Did You Do It, Truett?'', and a final book on the significance of money in today's society titled ''Wealth, Is It Worth It?''. He also contributed to the anthologies ''What My Parents Did Right''&lt;ref&gt;http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0705/2002068567-t.html&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Conversations on Success'', and co-wrote with [[Ken Blanchard]] ''Generosity Factor: Discover the Joy of Giving Your Time, Talent, and Treasure''. [[McDonough-Fayetteville Road]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia|Fayette]], [[Henry County, Georgia|Henry]], and [[Clayton County, GA|Clayton]] counties, is named in his honor. Cathy said that the motivational book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' by [[Napoleon Hill]] was one of the greatest foundations for inspiration growing up.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy, S. Truett ''Eat Mor Chikin: Inspire More People'', 2002. Looking Glass Books; {{ISBN|1-929619-08-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, he opened Upscale Pizza in [[Fayetteville, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Guy Collier|first=Joe|url=http://www.ajc.com/business/content/business/stories/2008/04/25/truett_0425.html|title=Chick-fil-A founder opens pizza restaurant|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=2008-04-25|accessdate=2011-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204023638/http://www.ajc.com/business/content/business/stories/2008/04/25/truett_0425.html|archivedate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, he retired as both chairman and CEO of Chick-fil-A, leaving his son, [[Dan T.

In his remarks, Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee at the time, said, "The Romney campaign comes to a sudden stop when we spot a Chick-fil-A. Your chicken sandwiches were our comfort food through the primary season, and heaven knows there were days that we needed a lot of comfort." Romney congratulated Cathy on his "well-deserved honor today".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Clare, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/05/12/romney-speaks-at-anti-gay-liberty-university-alongside-baptist-billionaire "Romney Speaks At Anti-Gay Liberty University Alongside Baptist Billionaire"], ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' blog, May 12, 2012; retrieved 2012-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Humane Letters from [[Oglethorpe University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Degrees Awarded by Oglethorpe University |publisher=Oglethorpe University |url=http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/history/honorary_degrees.asp |accessdate=2015-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319104000/http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/history/honorary_degrees.asp |archivedate=2015-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he was inducted as a Georgia Trustee. The honor is given by the [[Georgia Historical Society]], in conjunction with the [[Governor of Georgia]], to individuals whose accomplishments and community service reflect the ideals of the founding body of [[Trustee Georgia|Trustees]], which governed the Georgia colony from 1732 to 1752.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''Sture Birger Eskilsson''' (18 March 1930 – 5 March 2016) was a Swedish economist who was the Director of Information of the [[Swedish Employers' Association]] ({{lang-sv|Svenska arbetsgivareförening}}, ''SAF'') and chairman of the [[think tank]] [[Timbro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svensktidskrift.se/?p=4164 Sture Eskilsson, 80 – bra för Sverige], [[Svensk Tidskrift]], March 12, 2010 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/sture-eskilsson-19302016|title=Sture Eskilsson (1930–2016)|author=Tove Lifvendahl|date=6 March 2016|work=SvD.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Kristinehamn]].

Eskilsson was employed at SAF as an [[economist]] in 1957. In 1968 he was transferred to SAF:s Department of Public Relations. There he was commissioned to set up a new strategy in order to create a counterweight against the increasing influence of the [[New Left]] movement. In 1970, Eskilsson was appointed as Director of Information of SAF and the following year he outlined his strategic thoughts in an internal memo on what needed to be done in order to influence the public opinion and create a stronger support for [[free market]] [[capitalism]], [[Entrepreneurship|enterprise]] and [[individual liberty]]. Eskilsson proposed a serious, long-term work focusing on [[Ideology|ideological]] and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] debate. A result of this new strategy was the creation of the [[think tank]] [[Timbro]] in 1978, where Eskilsson served as chairman from its founding until 1998.

In 2003, Eskilsson was one of the founding members of the organization [[Medborgare mot EMU]] ("Citizens Against the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]]"), which campaigned against Swedish adoption of the [[euro]] in the [[Swedish euro referendum, 2003|2003 referendum]].

'''Theodore P. Angelopoulos''' (born 1943) is a Greek shipping and steel magnate.

==Early life==
Theodore Angelopoulos was born in Athens, and lived in Switzerland for many years, where he received a BSc in Business Administration from the [[University of Zurich]]. His family were pioneers in the Greek steel industry and began dealing in the dry cargo sector of the shipping industry in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="greeknewsonline1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.greeknewsonline.com/gianna-and-theodore-angelopoulos-to-receive-lead100-award-for-excellence/ |title=Gianna and Theodore Angelopoulos to Receive Lead100 Award for Excellence &amp;#124; Greek News |publisher=Greeknewsonline.com |date=2011-03-29 |accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Angelopoulos built an internationally based group of companies with interests in shipping and steel, and with investments in real estate and private equities, as well as other financial entities worldwide.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1996, he established Metrostar Management in Athens, and entered the oil tanker market in the same year, with his company going on to become one of the world's leading oil tanker operators. In 2002, he took control of the Dutch shipbuilding company oceAnco and he re-established it as a leading shipbuilder of custom-built luxury mega-yachts.&lt;ref name="greeknewsonline1"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Angelopoulos is married to [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]].&lt;ref name="greeknewsonline1"/&gt;

His two nephews, [[Panagiotis Angelopoulos]] and [[Giorgos Angelopoulos]] are also in shipping, and steel.

In 1990, Angelopoulos bought the [[56 Old Church Street|Old Rectory]] in Chelsea, for some years London's largest and most expensive residential property, and probably the first in London to sell for more than £10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Julia Kollewe |author2=Rupert Neate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/01/london-property-stable-investment-europeans |title=London property offers stable investment for wealthy Europeans &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he had the 82 metre yacht Alfa Nero built. In 2011, Alfa Nero was up for sale with an asking price of US$115 million, and it was bought by the Russian billionaire [[Andrey Guryev]].&lt;ref name="superyachtfan1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.superyachtfan.com/superyacht/superyacht_alfa_nero.html |title=SuperYacht Alfa Nero - Andrey Guryev - PhosAgro |publisher=Superyachtfan.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, he owns a new 66 metre yacht, called ''Okto''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="superyachtfan1"/&gt;

[[Image:KAS-Bonitz, Peter-Bild-15535-1.jpg|thumb|A German campaign poster with the slogan ''Es Gibt Keine Alternative'' (1994)]]
'''There is no alternative''' (shortened as '''TINA''') was a slogan often used by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[British prime minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=There Is No Alternative: Why Margaret Thatcher Matters|last=Berlinski|first=Claire|date=8 November 2011|publisher=Basic Books|edition=Second|language=English|isbn=978-0465031214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was used to signify Thatcher's claim that the [[market economy]] is the only system that works, and that debate about this is over. One commenter characterised the meaning of the slogan as "Globalised capitalism, so called free-markets and free trade were the best ways to build wealth, distribute services and grow a society's economy. Deregulation's good, if not God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flanders|first1=Laura|authorlink=Laura Flanders|title=At Thatcher's Funeral, Bury TINA, Too|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=April 12, 2013|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/thatchers-funeral-bury-tina-too/ |accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Thatcher described her support of markets as flowing from a more basic moral argument. Specifically she argued that the market-principle of choice flows from the moral principle that for human behavior to be moral requires free-choice by people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Historically, the phrase may be traced to its emphatic use by the nineteenth-century [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] thinker [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Statics |year=1851 |pages=42, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the principle used it in a derisory manner. For instance cabinet minister [[Norman St John-Stevas]], one of the leading "[[Wets and dries|wets]]", nicknamed Thatcher "Tina". In economics, politics, and [[political economy]], others have used it to mean that "there is no alternative" to [[neoliberalism]]&amp;mdash;that [[free market]]s, [[free trade]], and [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[globalisation]] are the best or the only way for modern societies to develop.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Thomas Chay Beale''' (13 December 1805 – 3 November 1857) was a Scottish merchant and diplomat operating in the [[Far East]] during the 19th century. He was a Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honor]] and of the Portuguese Order of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deaths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40BDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=Thomas+Chay+Beale|accessdate=27 May 2018|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|publisher=R.

==Biography==
Chay Beale was a nephew of opium trader and merchant [[Daniel Beale]] and his brother [[Thomas Beale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le Pichon|first1=Alain|title=China Trade and Empire: Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. and the Origins of British Rule in Hong Kong, 1827-1843|date=2006|publisher=OUP/British Academy|isbn=9780197263372|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ql7CqEV6d4C&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Thomas+Chay+Beale|accessdate=27 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OPC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gwulo.com/sites/gwulo.com/.../Gwulo-Macau-Old-Protestant-Cemetery.pdf|title=Old Protestant Cemetery in Macau|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1826, he was a partner in the trading firm of [[Hollingworth Magniac|Magniac &amp; Co.]] in [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]], China. In the 1830s he left Magniacs and operated on his own until 1845 when he established the [[Shanghai]] based agency house of Dent, Beale &amp; Co. with [[Lancelot Dent]]. By 1851, Beale was Portuguese Consul and Dutch Vice Counsel in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Cranmer-Byng J.L. and Ride, Lindsay T., ''Journal of Occurrences at Canton 1839'' [sic] in Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch; Vol. 4 (1964) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deacon Brodie figure.jpg|thumb|Brodie advertising figure on Edinburgh's [[Royal Mile]]]]
'''William Brodie''' (28 September 1741 – 1 October 1788), often known by his title of '''Deacon Brodie''', was a Scottish [[cabinet making|cabinet-maker]], [[Deacon#Scots usage|deacon]] of a trades [[guild]], and [[Edinburgh]] city councillor, who maintained a secret life as a [[housebreaker]], partly for the thrill, and partly to fund his gambling.

==Career==
By day, Brodie was a respectable [[tradesman]] and deacon (president) of the Incorporation of [[Wright]]s, which locally controlled the craft of cabinetmaking; this made him a member of the town council. Part of his work as a cabinetmaker was to install and repair [[Lock (security device)|locks]] and other security mechanisms. He socialised with the gentry of Edinburgh and met the poet [[Robert Burns]] and the painter [[Henry Raeburn]]. He was a member of the Edinburgh Cape Club&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8buM0pK9IpMC&amp;pg=PA26 Deacon Brodie of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Cape Club], Google books&lt;/ref&gt; and was known by the pseudonym "Sir Llyud".

At night, however, Brodie became a housebreaker and thief. He used his daytime work as a way to gain knowledge about the security mechanisms of his customers and to copy their [[Key (lock)|key]]s using [[wax]] impressions. As the foremost locksmith of the city, Brodie was asked to work in the houses of many of the richest members of Edinburgh society. He used the money he made dishonestly to maintain his second life, which included a gambling habit and five children by two [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]es, who did not know of each other and were unknown in the city. He reputedly began his criminal career around 1768, when he copied keys to a bank door and stole £800, then enough to maintain a household for several years. In 1786 he recruited a gang of three thieves, John Brown, a thief on the run from a seven-year sentence of [[Penal transportation|transportation]], George Smith, a locksmith who ran a grocer's shop in the [[Cowgate]], and Andrew Ainslie, a shoemaker.

==Capture and trial==
[[File:Edinburgh. Brodie's Close. Deacon's House Cafe.jpg|thumb|Brodie's Close. Deacon's House Café.]]
The case that led to Brodie's downfall began later in 1788 when he organised an armed raid on an [[excise office]] in Chessel's Court on [[the Canongate]]. Brodie's plan failed. On the same night, Brown approached the authorities to claim a King's Pardon, which had been offered after a previous robbery, and gave up the names of Smith and Ainslie (initially saying nothing of Brodie's involvement). Smith and Ainslie were arrested and the next day Brodie attempted to visit them in prison but was refused. Realising that he had to leave Edinburgh, Brodie escaped to London and then to the [[Netherlands]] intending to flee to the United States but was arrested in [[Amsterdam]] and shipped back to Edinburgh for trial.

The trial of Brodie and Smith started on 27 August 1788. At first there was no hard evidence against Brodie, although the tools of his criminal trade (copied keys, a disguise and pistols) were found in his house and workshops. But with Brown's evidence and Ainslie being persuaded to turn King's Evidence, added to the self-incriminating lines in the letters he had written while on the run, the jury found Brodie and Smith guilty.

Brodie and Smith were hanged at the [[Old Tolbooth]] in the High Street on 1 October 1788, before a crowd of 40,000. According to one tale, Brodie wore a steel collar and silver tube to prevent the hanging from being fatal. It was said that he had bribed the hangman to ignore it and arranged for his body to be removed quickly in the hope that he could later be revived. If so, the plan failed. Brodie was buried in an unmarked grave at the Buccleuch Church in Chapel Street. The ground is now covered by a car park behind university lecture-halls. However, rumours of his being seen in Paris circulated later and gave the story of his scheme to evade death further publicity.

==Popular culture==
Popular [[mythology|myth]] holds that Deacon Brodie built the first gallows in Edinburgh and was also its first victim. Of this [[William Roughead]] in ''Classic Crimes'' states that after research he was sure that although the Deacon may have had some hand in the design, "...it was certainly not of his construction, nor was he the first to benefit by its ingenuity".

{{Main|Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde}}
[[Robert Louis Stevenson]], whose father owned furniture that had been made by Brodie, wrote a play (with [[W. E. Henley]]) entitled ''Deacon Brodie, or The Double Life,'' which was unsuccessful. However, Stevenson remained fascinated by the [[dichotomy]] between Brodie's respectable façade and his real nature, and this paradox inspired him to write the novel ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde]],'' which he published in 1886.&lt;ref name="realstory"&gt;{{cite news |last=Oslin |first=Reid |url= http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v9/mr15/horror.html |title=Jekyll and Hyde: The Real Story |work=[[Boston College]] Chronicle |date=15 March 2001 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deacon Brodie is commemorated by a [[public house|pub]] of that name on [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Royal Mile]], on the corner of the [[Royal Mile#Lawnmarket|Lawnmarket]] and Bank Street which leads down to [[the Mound]]; and a close off the Royal Mile, which contained his family residence and workshops, now bears the name "Brodie's Close." A further two pubs carry his name, one in [[New York City]] on the south side of the famous west side 46th Street Restaurant Row between [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth]] and [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth Avenue]], and the other in [[Ottawa]] on the corner of Elgin and Cooper

The titular character of the novel ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' claims to be descended from Deacon Brodie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Muriel |last=Spark |author-link=Muriel Spark |title=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie |page=88|title-link=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel) }}&lt;/ref&gt; His double life serves as a metaphor for her duplicity, as well as her self-imposed demise. The novel has been adapted into a [[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (play)|play]], [[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)|film]], and [[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (TV series)|television series]].

The "Deacon Brodie" episode of the [[BBC One]] television drama anthology ''[[Screen One]]'' starred [[Billy Connolly]] as Brodie, aired on 8 March 1997, and was made in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0176645|title=Deacon Brodie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
