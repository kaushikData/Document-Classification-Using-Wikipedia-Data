The '''A386''' is a [[primary route]] in [[Devon]], England. It runs from [[Plymouth]] on the south coast to [[Appledore, North Devon|Appledore]] on the north coast.

The road starts in the centre of Plymouth, and forms Tavistock Road, the main route out of the city to the north. It crosses a section of [[Dartmoor]] to [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]] and [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]]. The A386 then heads northeast across the western fringe of Dartmoor past the village of [[Lydford]] to the [[A30 road|A30]] west of [[Okehampton]]. It passes to the west of Okehampton to reach [[Hatherleigh]], where the road joins the valley of the [[River Torridge]]. It follows the valley to, [[Meeth]], Merton, [[Great Torrington]], [[Bideford]] and finally Appledore.

== History ==
The route is little changed from its original alignment in 1922. It originally ended at Bideford, and was extended north first to [[Northam, Devon|Northam]] and then to Appledore on the former route of the B3236. The route originally went through the town of Okehampton. In about 1971 it was realigned to its present route on the former route of the B3219. In the north of Plymouth the road was rebuilt in the 1970s to bypass the village of [[Crownhill]].

The river is flowing on bedrock in the upper image, but because sediment was deposited over time the riverbed has risen. This has caused the house to be buried in the lower image.]]

'''Aggradation''' (or '''alluviation''') is the term used in [[geology]] for the increase in land elevation, typically in a river system, due to the [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] of sediment. Aggradation occurs in areas in which the supply of sediment is greater than the amount of material that the system is able to [[sediment transport|transport]]. The mass balance between sediment being transported and sediment in the bed is described by the [[Exner equation]].

Typical aggradational environments include lowland [[alluvial]] [[river]]s, [[river delta]]s, and [[alluvial fan]]s. Aggradational environments are often undergoing slow [[subsidence]] which balances the increase in land surface elevation due to aggradation. After millions of years, an aggradational environment will become a [[sedimentary basin]], which contains the deposited sediment, including [[paleochannel]]s and ancient [[floodplain]]s.

Aggradation can be caused by changes in [[climate]], [[land use]], and geologic activity, such as [[volcanic eruption]], [[earthquake]]s, and [[fault (geology)|faulting]]. For example, volcanic eruptions may lead to rivers carrying more sediment than the flow can transport: this leads to the burial of the old channel and its [[floodplain]]. In another example, the quantity of sediment entering a river channel may increase when climate becomes drier. The increase in sediment is caused by a decrease in soil binding that results from plant growth being suppressed. The drier conditions cause river flow to decrease at the same time as sediment is being supplied in greater quantities, resulting in the river becoming choked with sediment.

In 2009, a report by researchers from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] in the journal [[Nature Geoscience]] said that reduced aggradation was contributing to an increased risk of flooding in many river deltas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Black | first = Richard | title = 'Millions at risk' as deltas sink | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 2009-09-21 | url = http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8266500.stm | accessdate = 2009-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Algoma''' is a [[placename]] given to many different places throughout the United States and Canada.  Examples include [[Algoma District, Ontario]], [[Algoma, Oregon]], [[Algoma, Wisconsin]], and [[Algoma Township, Michigan]].  Algoma also lends its name to companies such as [[Algoma Steel]] and [[Algoma Central Railway]].

== Word origin ==

The origin of the word ''Algoma'' is not entirely clear; the following are definitions culled from several different sources
* The word ''Algoma'' was invented as a [[placename]] by [[Henry Schoolcraft]].  [[Goma (disambiguation)|Goma]] comes from the Algonquian suffix ''-gamaa'' for "lake", while Schoolcraft took the ''al'' prefix from the word [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]. [[Henry Schoolcraft]]'s original text, supports the idea that he invented this word: {{blockquote|In the term Gitchegomee, the name for [[Lake Superior|Superior]], we have a specimen of their mode of making compounds. Gitche signifies something great, or possessing the property of positive magnitude. Gomee is itself a compound phrase, denoting, when so conjoined, a large body of water. It is the objective member of their term for the sea; but is governed by its antecedent, and may be used in describing other and minor, even the most minute liquid bodies, as we hear it, in the compound term mushkuagomee, i.e. strong drink. Under the government of the term gitchee, it appears to express simply the sense of great water, but conveys the idea, to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] mind, of sea-water. I have cast about, to find a sonorous form of elision, in which it may come into popular use, but find nothing more eligible than I-go-mee, or Igoma. A more practical word, in the shape of a new compound, may be made in Algoma, a term in which the first syllable of the generic name of this tribe of the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquin]] stock, harmonizes very well with the Indian idea of goma (sea), giving us, Sea of the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquins]]. The term may be objected to, as the result of a grammatical abbreviation, but if not adopted practically, it may do as a poetical synonym for this great lake. Such is, at least, the result of a full discussion of these names, with the very best speakers of the language.|[[Henry Schoolcraft]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11119/11119-h/11119-h.htm |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Personal Memoirs of a Residence of Thirty Years with the Indian Tribes on the American Frontiers | first=Henry Rowe |last=Schoolcraft |authorlink=Henry Schoolcraft |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-02-16 |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Another definition for the word states that Algoma actually comes from ''A'Goma'' ([[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]] ''Egema''; [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] ''Agimaa'') for "[[snow shoe]]". Source: Rev. E. P. Wheeler; A. Skinner in Milwaukee Public Museum Bulletin. r.6 p.399
* Yet another definition from the [[Algoma, Wisconsin]] Chamber of Commerce claims that ''Algoma'' is an Indian word meaning "park of flowers".  Several web sites that provide meanings for the names of children and pets state that ''Algoma'' means "valley of flowers".
* The history of the town of Algoma, [[Mississippi]] contains a reference to ''Algoma'' as a [[Chickasaw]] word meaning "God abides" given as the name to the Algoma community by a [[Presbyterian]] [[preacher]] named Savage.

== Variations ==

The word ''Algona'' is frequently seen, substituting an ''n'' for an ''m''.  Various sources cite this as a corruption of [[Henry Schoolcraft]]'s original word ''Algoma''.  ''[[Alcona (disambiguation)|Alcona]]'' itself is a [[placename]] used in the United States and Canada.

[[Image:Arnold Guyot03.jpg|thumb|260px|Australia map compiled by Arnold Henry Guyot and [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard]]]]
'''Arnold Henry Guyot''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|iː|oʊ|}} {{respell|GHEE|oh}})&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New Biographical Dictionary'' (Springfield, Mass.: Merriam-Webster, 1988; {{ISBN|9780877795438}}), p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; (September 28, 1807{{snd}}February 8, 1884) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-American [[geologist]] and [[geographer]].

==Early life==
Guyot was born on September 28, 1807 at [[Boudevilliers]], near [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]]. He was educated at Chaux-de-Fonds, then at the college of Neuchâtel. In 1825, he went to Germany and resided in [[Karlsruhe]] where he met [[Louis Agassiz]], the beginning of a lifelong friendship. From Karlsruhe he moved to [[Stuttgart]], where he studied at the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. He returned to Neuchâtel in 1827. He determined to enter the ministry and started at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] to attend lectures. While pursuing his studies, he also attended lectures on philosophy and natural science. His leisure time was spent in collecting shells and plants, and he received an entrée to the [[Berlin Botanical Garden]] from [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]]. In 1835, he received the degree of PhD from Berlin.

==Biography==
In 1838, at Agassiz's suggestion, he visited the Swiss glaciers and communicated the results of his six-week investigation to the Geological Society of France. He was the first to point out certain important observations relating to [[glacial motion]] and structure. Among other things he noted the more rapid flow of the center than of the sides, and the more rapid flow of the top than of the bottom of glaciers; described the laminated or ribboned structure of the glacial ice; and ascribed the movement of glaciers to a gradual molecular displacement rather than to a sliding of the ice mass as held by [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure|de Saussure]]. He subsequently collected important data concerning erratic boulders.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1839, he became the colleague of Agassiz as professor of history and physical geography at the College of Neuchâtel (a.k.a. Neuchâtel Academy). The suspension of that institution in 1848 caused Guyot to emigrate, at Agassiz's instance, to the United States, where he settled in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He delivered a course of lectures at the [[Lowell Institute]] which were afterward published as ''Earth and Man'' (Boston 1849). For several years the [[Massachusetts Board of Education]] retained his services as a lecturer on geography and methods of instruction to the normal schools and teachers' institutes.

He was occupied with this work until his appointment, in 1854, as professor of physical geography and geology at [[Princeton University]], which office he retained until his death. He was also for several years lecturer on physical geography in the State Normal School in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and from 1861 to 1866 lecturer in the Princeton Theological Seminary. He also gave courses in the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], New York, and at [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]]. He founded the museum at Princeton, many of the specimens of which are from his own collections.

His scientific work in the United States included the perfection of plans for a national system of [[Meteorology|meteorological]] observations. Most of these were conducted under the auspices of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. His extensive meteorological observations led to the establishment of the [[United States Weather Bureau]], and his ''Meteorological and Physical Tables'' (1852, revised ed. 1884) were long standard.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[Image:Bear Seamount guyot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Bear Seamount]], a ''guyot'']]
A [[guyot]], also known as a tablemount, is an isolated underwater volcanic  mountain ([[seamount]]), with a flat top over 200 metres (660&amp;nbsp;feet) below the surface of the sea. The diameters of these flat summits can exceed {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/250080/guyot Guyot] ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', 2010. Retrieved June 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "guyot" was coined by [[Harry Hammond Hess]] and named after Arnold Guyot.

Guyot rejected [[Darwinism|Darwin's theory of human evolution]] and, at the same time, he accepted [[Hugh Miller]]'s views on the book of Genesis, [[old-earth creationism|thinking that the days described there might have taken a longer period of time]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley A. Rice (2009). Encyclopedia of Evolution, Infobase Publishing. p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist [[James Dwight Dana]] described Guyot as "a fervently religious man, living as if ever in communion with his Heavenly Parent; a Christian, following closely in the footsteps of his Master."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Dwight Dana|Dana, James Dwight]] (1886). ''[http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/guyot-arnold.pdf Biographical memoir of Arnold Guyot]''. National Academy. p.344&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick De Land Leete (1928). ''Christianity in Science''. Abingdon Press, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guyot's ''Creation, or the Biblical Cosmogony in the Light of Modern Science'' (1884) was critically reviewed in the ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' journal.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1884). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1759062 ''Review: Guyot's View of Creation. Reviewed Work: Creation; Or the Biblical Cosmogony in the Light of Modern Science by Arnold Guyot'']. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 3 (67): 599-601.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
His graded series of text books and wall maps were important aids in the extension and popularization of geological study in America. In addition to text books, his principal publications were:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
*[https://archive.org/details/earthmanlectures00guyoiala ''Earth and Man, Lectures on Comparative Physical Geography in its Relation to the History of Mankind]'' (translated by [[Cornelius Conway Felton]], 1849)
*''A Memoir of Louis Agassiz'' (1883)
*''[https://archive.org/stream/creationorbiblic00guy#page/n9/mode/2up Creation, or the Biblical Cosmogony in the Light of Modern Science]'' (1884)
*''Johnson’s New Universal Cyclopaedia'' (1876) - editor-in-chief along with [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard]]

==Namesakes==
He is the namesake of several geographical features, including [[Guyot Glacier]] in [[Alaska]], [[Mount Guyot (Great Smoky Mountains)|Mount Guyot]] on the North Carolina and Tennessee border, and a different [[Mount Guyot (New Hampshire)|Mount Guyot]] in New Hampshire, as well as Mount Guyot on the Rocky Mountain Continental Divide in Colorado. The building housing the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Department of Geosciences at Princeton is named Guyot Hall in his honor.

==Death==
Guyot died on February 8, 1884 at [[Princeton, New Jersey]].

'''Capisterre''' (a [[corruption (grammar)|corruption]] of the original [[French language|French]] name '''Capesterre''') is a region covering the Northern Coastal plain on the Island of [[Saint Kitts]]. It was originally colonized by the [[French people|French]] in the early 17th century, with its capital on the only [[harbour]], in the fishing town of [[Dieppe Bay Town, Saint Kitts and Nevis|Dieppe]]. The area was lost to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] in 1713. Significant numbers of French immigrants from the neighbouring island of [[Saint-Barthélemy|Saint Barths]] came to Capisterre in the early 20th century, and became infamous for their illegal [[moonshine]] trade.

The region is home to the community festival [[La festival de Capisterre| La Festival de Capisterre]] which takes place every September during the week of [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] independence (September 19th).

The '''Carpathian Mountains''' or '''Carpathians''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑr|ˈ|p|eɪ|θ|i|ən|z}}) are a [[mountain range]] system forming an arc roughly {{convert|1500|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long across [[Central and Eastern Europe]], making them the second-longest mountain range in [[Europe]] (after the [[Scandinavian Mountains]], {{convert|1700|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}){{dubious|date=November 2018}}.

In modern times, the range is called ''Karpaty'' in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and ''Карпати (Karpaty)'' in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], ''Karpati'' or ''Карпати'' in [[Serbian language|Serbian]],  ''Carpați'' {{IPA-ro|karˈpat͡sʲ||Ro-Carpați.ogg}} in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''Karpaten'' in German, and ''Kárpátok'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].{{sfn|Moldovanu|2010|p=18}}{{sfn|Blazovich|1994|p=332}} Although the toponym was recorded already by [[Ptolemy]] in the second century of the Christian era, {{sfn|Buza|2011|p=24}} the modern form of the name is a [[neologism]] in most languages.{{sfn|Moldovanu|2010|p=18}} For instance, ''Havasok'' ("Snowy Mountains") was its medieval [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] name; Russian chronicles referred to it as "Hungarian Mountains". {{sfn|Blazovich|1994|p=332}}{{sfn|Moldovanu|2010|p=18}}  Later sources, such as [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] and the Italian chronicler Giovanandrea Gromo, referred to the range as "Transylvania's Mountains", while the 17th-century historian [[Constantin Cantacuzino (stolnic)|Constantin Cantacuzino]] translated the name of the mountains in an Italian-Romanian glossary to "Rumanian Mountains". {{sfn|Moldovanu|2010|p=18}}

[[File:Carpathians dem.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|Relief map of the Carpathian Mountains]]
The name "Carpates" is highly associated with the old Dacian tribes called "[[Carpes]]" or "[[Carpi (people)|Carpi]]" who lived in a large area from the east, north-east of the Black Sea to Transylvanian plains on the present day Romania and Moldova.
The name ''Carpates'' may ultimately be from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]] root ''*sker-''/''*ker-'', from which comes the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] word ''karpë'' (rock), and the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word ''skála'' (rock, cliff), perhaps via a [[Dacian language|Dacian]] cognate{{Which|date=March 2011}} which meant mountain, rock, or rugged (cf. Germanic root ''*skerp-'', Old Norse ''harfr'' "harrow", Gothic ''skarpo'', Middle Low German ''scharf'' "potsherd", and Modern High German ''Scherbe'' "shard", Old English ''scearp'' and English ''sharp'', Lithuanian ''kar~pas'' "cut, hack, notch", Latvian ''cìrpt'' "to shear, clip"). The archaic Polish word ''karpa'' meant "rugged irregularities, underwater obstacles/rocks, rugged roots, or trunks". The more common word ''skarpa'' means a sharp cliff or other vertical terrain. The name may instead come from Indo-European *''kwerp'' "to turn", akin to Old English ''hweorfan'' "to turn, change" (English warp) and Greek {{lang|grc|καρπός}} ''karpós'' "wrist", perhaps referring to the way the mountain range bends or veers in an L-shape.&lt;ref&gt;Room, Adrian. ''Placenames of the World''. London: MacFarland and Co., Inc., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] documents, the Eastern Carpathian Mountains were referred to as ''Montes Sarmatici'' (meaning [[Sarmatian]] Mountains).&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in work ''Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis, Asiana et Europiana, et de contentis in eis'' by [[Maciej Miechowita|Mathias de Miechow]], first edition from 1517. [https://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost16/Miechow/mie_tr21.html Second book, chapter 1].&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Carpathians were called ''Carpates'', a name that is first recorded in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' (second century AD).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In the Scandinavian ''[[Hervarar saga]]'', which relates ancient Germanic legends about [[Hlöðskviða|battles]] between [[Goths]] and [[Huns]], the name ''Karpates'' appears in the predictable Germanic form as ''Harvaða fjöllum'' (see [[Grimm's law]]).

"''Inter Alpes Huniae et Oceanum est Polonia''" by [[Gervase of Tilbury]], has described in his ''Otia Imperialia'' ("Recreation for an Emperor") in 1211.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Thirteenth- to fifteenth-century Hungarian documents named the mountains ''Thorchal'', ''Tarczal'', or less frequently ''Montes Nivium''.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Gervase of Tilbury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northwestern Carpathians begin in Slovakia and southern Poland. They surround [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]] and [[Transylvania]] in a large semicircle, sweeping towards the southeast, and end on the [[Danube]] near [[Orşova]] in Romania. The total length of the Carpathians is over {{convert|1500|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and the mountain chain's width varies between {{convert|12|and|500|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The highest altitudes of the Carpathians occur where they are widest. The system attains its greatest breadth in the Transylvanian plateau and in the southern [[Tatra Mountains]] group &amp;ndash; the highest range, in which [[Gerlachovský štít]] in Slovakia is the highest peak at {{convert|2655|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. The Carpathians cover an area of {{convert|190000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, and after the [[Alps]], form the next-most extensive mountain system in Europe.

Although commonly referred to as a mountain chain, the Carpathians do not actually form an uninterrupted chain of mountains. Rather, they consist of several [[orography|orographically]] and geologically distinctive groups, presenting as great a structural variety as the Alps. The Carpathians, which attain an altitude over {{convert|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in only a few places, lack the bold peaks, extensive snowfields, large [[glacier]]s, high waterfalls, and numerous large lakes that are common in the Alps. It was believed that no area of the Carpathian range was covered in snow all year round and there were no glaciers, but recent research by Polish scientists discovered one permafrost and glacial area in the Tatra Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gądek, Gradiecz|first=Bogdan, Mariusz|title=Glacial Ice and Permafrost Distribution in the Medena Kotlina (Slovak Tatras): Mapped with Application of GPR and GST Measurements|url=http://www.igipz.pan.pl/tl_files/igipz/ZGiHGiW/sgcb/sgcb_42/sgcb_42_01.pdf|work=Landform Evolution in Mountain Areas|publisher=Studia Geomorphologica Carpatho-Balcanica|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carpathians at their highest altitude are only as high as the middle region of the Alps, with which they share a common appearance, climate, and [[flora (plants)|flora]].
The Carpathians are separated from the Alps by the [[Danube]]. The two ranges meet at only one point: the [[Leitha Mountains]] at Bratislava. The river also separates them from the [[Balkan Mountains]] at Orşova in Romania. The valley of the [[Morava (river)|March]] and [[Oder]] separates the Carpathians from the [[Silesia]]n and [[Moravia]]n chains, which belong to the middle wing of the great Central Mountain System of Europe. Unlike the other wings of the system, the Carpathians, which form the watershed between the northern seas and the [[Black Sea]], are surrounded on all sides by plains, namely the [[Pannonian plain]] to the southwest, the plain of the Lower [[Danube]] (Romania) to the south, and the [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] plain to the northeast.

== Geology ==
[[File:Slovakia Vratna 11.jpg|thumb|[[Vrátna dolina]], Slovakia]]
The area now occupied by the Carpathians was once occupied by smaller ocean basins. The Carpathian mountains were formed during the [[Alpine orogeny]] in the [[Mesozoic]]&lt;ref&gt;Plašienka, D., 2002, [http://www.geologicacarpathica.sk/special/P/Plasienka.pdf ''Origin and growth of the Western Carpathian orogenetic wedge during the mesozoic.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007182210/http://www.geologicacarpathica.sk/special/P/Plasienka.pdf |date=7 October 2011 }}'' (PDF) in Geologica Carpathica Special Issues 53 Proceedings of XVII. Congress of Carpathian-Balkan Geological Association Bratislava, 1–4 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tertiary]] by moving the [[ALCAPA (tectonic plate)|ALCAPA]], [[Tisza Plate|Tisza]] and [[Dacia Plate|Dacia]] plates over [[subduction|subducting]] [[oceanic crust]].&lt;ref&gt;Mantovani, E., Viti, M., Babbucci, D., Tamburelli, C., Albarello, D., 2006, Geodynamic connection between the indentation of Arabia and the Neogene tectonics of the central–eastern Mediterranean region. GSA Special Papers, v. 409, p. 15-41&lt;/ref&gt;
The mountains take the form of a [[fold and thrust belt]] with generally north [[Vergence (geology)|vergence]] in the western segment, northeast to east vergence in the eastern portion and southeast vergence in the southern portion.

The external, generally northern, portion of the orogenic belt is a Tertiary [[accretionary prism]] of a so-called [[Flysch|Flysch belt]] (the [[Carpathian Flysch Belt]]) created by rocks scraped off the sea bottom and thrust over the North-European plate. The Carpathian [[accretionary wedge]] is made of several thin skinned [[nappe]]s composed of Cretaceous to Paleogene [[turbidite]]s. Thrusting of the Flysch nappes over the Carpathian foreland caused the formation of the [[Carpathian foreland basin]].&lt;ref&gt;Nehyba, S., Šikula, J., 2007, ''Depositional architecture, sequence stratigraphy and geodynamic development of the Carpathian Foredeep (Czech Republic).'' Geologica Carpathica, 58, 1, pp. 53-69&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between the Flysch belt and internal zones of the orogenic belt in the western segment of the mountain range is marked by the [[Pieniny Klippen Belt]], a narrow complicated zone of polyphase compressional deformation, later involved in a supposed [[strike-slip]] zone.&lt;ref&gt;Mišík, M., 1997, ''The Slovak Part of the Pieniny Klippen Belt After the Pioneering Works of D. Andrusov.'' Geologica Carpathica, 48, 4, pp. 209-220&lt;/ref&gt; Internal zones in western and eastern segments contain older [[Variscan]] igneous massifs reworked in Mesozoic [[Thick-skinned deformation|thick]] and thin-skinned nappes. During the Middle [[Miocene]] this zone was affected by intensive [[calc-alkaline]]&lt;ref name="Pácskay, Z. 2006, pp. 511 - 530"&gt;Pácskay, Z., Lexa, J., Szákacs, A., 2006, ''Geochronology of Neogene magmatism in the Carpathian arc and intra-Carpathian area.'' Geologica Carpathica, 57, 6, pp. 511 - 530&lt;/ref&gt; [[arc volcanism]] that developed over the subduction zone of the flysch basins. At the same time, the internal zones of the orogenic belt were affected by large extensional structure&lt;ref&gt;Dolton, G.L., 2006, ''Pannonian Basin Province, Central Europe (Province 4808)—Petroleum geology, total petroleum systems, and petroleum resource assessment.''

Iron, gold and silver were found in great quantities in the [[Western Carpathians]]. After the Roman emperor [[Trajan]]'s conquest of Dacia, he brought back to Rome over 165 tons of gold and 330 tons of silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dacia-Province of the Roman Empire |publisher=United Nations of Roma Victor |url=http://www.unrv.com/province/dacia.php |accessdate=2010-11-14 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions of the Carpathians==
{{main article|Divisions of the Carpathians}}
[[File:mapcarpat2.png|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the main divisions of the Carpathians.&lt;br /&gt;
1. [[Outer Western Carpathians]]&lt;br /&gt;
2. [[Inner Western Carpathians]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. [[Outer Eastern Carpathians]]&lt;br /&gt;
4. [[Inner Eastern Carpathians]]&lt;br /&gt;
5. [[Southern Carpathians]]&lt;br /&gt;
6. [[Apuseni Mountains|Western Romanian Carpathians]]&lt;br /&gt;
7. [[Transylvanian Plateau]]&lt;br /&gt;
8. [[Serbian Carpathians]]&lt;br/&gt;
]]

The largest range is the [[Tatra Mountains|Tatras]] in Poland and Slovakia. A major part of the western and northeastern [[Outer Carpathians]] in Poland, Ukraine, and Slovakia is traditionally called the [[Beskids]].

The geological border between the Western and Eastern Carpathians runs approximately along the line (south to north) between the towns of [[Michalovce]], [[Bardejov]], [[Nowy Sącz]] and [[Tarnów]]. In older systems the border runs more in the east, along the line (north to south) along the rivers [[San River|San]] and [[Osława]] (Poland), the town of [[Snina]] (Slovakia) and river Tur'ia (Ukraine). Biologists, however, shift the border even further to the east.

The border between the eastern and southern Carpathians is formed by the [[Predeal]] Pass, south of Braşov and the [[Prahova Valley]].

Ukrainians sometimes denote as "Eastern Carpathians" only the Ukrainian Carpathians (or Wooded Carpathians), meaning the part situated largely on their territory (i.e., to the north of the [[Prislop Pass]]), while Romanians sometimes denote as "Eastern (Oriental) Carpathians" only the [[Romanian Carpathians]] part which lies on their territory (i.e., from the Ukrainian border or from the Prislop Pass to the south), which they subdivide into three simplified geographical groups (north, center, south), instead of Outer and Inner Eastern Carpathians. These are:
*Carpathians of Maramureș and Bukovina (Romanian: ''Carpații Maramureșului și ai Bucovinei'')
*Moldavian-Transylvanian Carpathians (Romanian: ''Carpații Moldo-Transilvani'')
*[[Curvature Carpathians]] (Romanian: ''Carpații Curburii, Carpații de Curbură'')

'''Champaran''' is a historic region which now forms the [[East Champaran district]], and the [[West Champaran district]] in [[Bihar]], [[India]]. Champaran is part of the cultural [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila region]].

== Boundaries ==
Champaran District was created in 1866. On 1 December 1901 it was split into two districts: Paschim Champaran and Purbi Champaran.  The headquarters of Paschim Champaran district is at Bettiah. The headquarters of Purbi Champaran district is at Motihari. Purbi Champaran consists of six subdivisions and twenty seven blocks.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Name ==
The name Champaran derives from ''Champa-aranya'' or ''Champkatanys''. ''Champa'' or ''champaka'' means ''magnolia'' and ''aranya'' means ''forest''. Hence, Champaranya means ''forest of magnolia trees''. It is believed that the forest was named while its western portion was inhabited by solitary ascetics.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Moscow]] has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with warm, sometimes hot, somewhat humid summers and long, cold winters.
Typical high temperatures in the warm months of June, July and August are around {{convert|23|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=on}}, but during heat waves, which can occur anytime from May to September, daytime temperature highs often top {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}} for sometimes one or two weeks. In the winter, temperatures normally drop to approximately {{convert|-10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, though there can be periods of warmth with temperatures rising above {{convert|0|°C}}. Summer lasts from mid-May to the beginning of September. Winter lasts from the beginning of November to the end of March.

== Monthly averages and records for Moscow ==
[[File:VVC weather station.png|thumb|200px|left|Location of the [[VVC weather station]]  on the map of Moscow]] 
The highest temperature ever recorded was {{Convert|38.2|°C|°F|abbr=on}} on July 29, 2010, and minimum temperature recorded was {{convert|-42|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moscow, Russia|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=551572&amp;cityname=Moscow-Central-Federal-District-Russia|publisher=Weatherbase}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 three record highs for the month occurred – January + {{convert|8.6|°C|°F}}, March + {{convert|17.5|°C|°F}}, and May + {{convert|33.2|°C|°F}}; in 2008, there were new record highs for December and the entire winter: + {{convert|9.6|°C|°F}}.  On July 23, 2010, the temperature reached {{Convert|36.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/07/24/13327739.html |title=Air temperatures in Moscow beat all records |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to set record highs each following day until it finally reached + {{convert|38.2|°C|°F}} on July 29, 2010.  In November 2010 a new month record high of +{{convert|14.5|°C|°F}} occurred (after +12.6 in 1927).
[[File:Moscow region temp.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Maximum temperature in Moscow and near regions during [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave]]]]

Average annual temperature in Moscow is {{Convert|5.8|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but recently (2007, 2008, 2015) it has been higher than {{Convert|7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="pogoda (data) 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pogoda.ru.net/data/27612.zip|title=Pogoda.ru.net (data), see article "Средняя (average)" |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |publisher= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 20th century, there was light night frost in late summer.&lt;ref name="pogoda (data) 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pogoda.ru.net/data/27612.zip|title=Pogoda.ru.net (data), see article "Минимум (minimum)" |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |publisher= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monthly rainfall totals vary minimally throughout the year, although the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] levels tend to be higher during the summer than during the winter. Due to the significant variation in temperature between the winter and summer months as well as the limited fluctuation in precipitation levels during the summer, Moscow is considered to be within a [[continental climate]] zone.

Most of records and averages are given for  [[VVC weather station]], located in the [[Administrative divisions of Moscow|North-Eastern administrative okrug]] of Moscow. The temperature from this station averages 0.5–1&amp;nbsp;°C lower than in the city center, and 0.5–2&amp;nbsp;°C higher than night minimums in the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmn.ru:8101/index1.php?code=22|title=Data from weather stations of Moscow region in real time |accessdate=March 25, 2009 |publisher= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type of precipitation ==
[[File:Годовой ход температуры в москве.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Annual course of temperature at [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre]]]]
Most precipitation in Moscow falls as rain, but in winter months almost all precipitation falls as snow, forming firm snow cover. The last wet snow precipitation may be in the beginning of May, and it may restart at the end of September.

=== Snow cover ===

Snow cover (averaging 3–5 months per year) is formed at the beginning of November and melts in beginning of April, but in recent years snow cover has lasted shorter than usual. For example, in the winter of 2006–2007 the snow cover didn't form until the end of January, and melted at the beginning of March; in 2007–2008, the snow cover melted at the end of February, and in the 2008–2009 winter, snow cover didn't form until the end of December, which is one month later than usual. Yet in 2011-2012 it melted in the middle of April.

== Wind ==

=== Speed of wind ===
The average wind speed is very high. In the city it is near 5 to 20 metres per second; in open places and airports it may top 6 metres per second.

==== Wind Storms and Tornadoes ====
A few times per season, often in the May–September period during thunderstorms, wind speed may exceed 15–35 metres per second.

=== Daylight, average number of hours/day ===
Duration of daylight depends on geographical position of Moscow. It varies from 7 hours 00 minutes on December 22 to 17 hours 34 minutes on June 22. The maximum height of the sun above the horizon is 11° on 22 December and 58° on 22 June.

Near the day of the [[summer solstice]] (June 22), the sun does not fall below −12°. Thus the [[astronomical twilight]] does not occur in this period. Thus, the astronomical night does not come. Nevertheless, such lighting is not enough for normal human activity, so the streets need artificial illumination, and it is believed that there are no so-called [[Midnight sun#White nights|white nights]] in Moscow, although the sky remains dark blue, and not black, as, for example, in southern Russia.

The '''Cork–Limerick–Galway corridor''' links the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s cities of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]] and [[Galway]]. Respectively, the cities are the Republic of Ireland's second, third and fourth [[List of urban areas in the Republic of Ireland by population|largest urban centres]].

==Transportation links==
===Air===
[[File:3.5.1 Flughafen Cork. Irland.JPG|thumb|right|Cork Airport]]
There are two international airports in the region: [[Cork Airport]] and [[Shannon Airport]]. Both airports provide connections to the [[United Kingdom]], [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. As well as providing pre-clearance facilities, as of September 2016, Shannon Airport also is the first and only airport outside the US to offer US Customs and Border Protection to private aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shannonairport.ie/gns/business/aviation-development/us-preclearance-for-private-aircraft.aspx shannonairport.ie - US Preclearance for Private Aircraft] retrieved 17 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

An airport, [[Galway Airport]], is also in Galway. However, the airport closed for commercial traffic in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galway Airport is closed until the end of February 2016|url=http://www.galwayairport.com/|website=Galway Airport|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160210100830/http://www.galwayairport.com/|archivedate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road===
Galway and Limerick are linked by the [[M18 motorway (Ireland)|M18]], and Limerick is linked to Cork by the [[N20 road|N20]]. A motorway, the M20, is planned between Cork and Limerick.&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Leader'' Full speed ahead for Limerick to Cork M20 Motorway (18 November 2017) http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/home/275875/full-speed-ahead-for-limerick-cork-m20-motorway.html&lt;/ref&gt; All three cities are connected to [[Dublin]] via motorway, Cork via the [[M8 motorway (Ireland)|M8]], Limerick via the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]] and Galway via the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6]].

===Rail===
The [[Western Rail Corridor]] links the three cities after recent major investment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The three cities are served by the [[Cork Suburban Rail]], [[Limerick Suburban Rail]] and [[Galway Suburban Rail]] networks. Cork is served by [[Cork Kent railway station|Kent Station]], Limerick by [[Limerick Colbert railway station|Colbert Station]] and Galway by [[Galway railway station|Galway Station]].

'''Elevator surfing''', also known as "liftsurfing", "vator surfing" or "elevaroping", is an activity involving riding on top of [[elevator]]s. Rarely, the activity may also involve jumping between moving elevators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s609279.htm |title=Surfing Medical Madness |accessdate=2006-08-27 |last=Kruszelnicki |first=Karl |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most elevator surfers consider this to be unwise and needlessly dangerous.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Elevator surfing is illegal in many locations, and several people have died or were injured elevator surfing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kohr |first=RM |date=March 1992 |title=Elevator surfing: a deadly new form of joyriding |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=640–5 |pmid=1500904 |issn=0022-1198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surfers can be crushed between the elevator and the top or sides of the elevator shaft, be struck by the [[counterweight]], or slip and fall to their deaths. The surfer does have the ability to stop the elevator at any time by pressing the emergency stop button on the roof of the elevator car, reducing the risk of being crushed against the top of the shaft.

Elevator surfing typically occurs in [[skyscrapers]] or on [[college]] [[campus]]es, especially those with tall buildings. Most large buildings have groups of elevators close together, which are most commonly used.

To begin, participants will usually go into such a building early in the morning, before too many people arrive to use the elevators, or late at night, when most of the building's occupants have left. Entry into the elevator shaft is usually achieved by using a special key to open the outer doors or, if the key cannot be accessed, by [[lock picking]]. Alternatively, participants may force the elevator car's doors open between floors and unlatch the outer doors from the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gene.greger-weltin.org/elevator_surfing/ |title=Urban Exploring Techniques: Elevator Surfing |accessdate=2006-08-27 |last=Greger |first=Gene |date=2003-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[common misconception]] is that the emergency hatch in the roof of the elevator can be opened from inside of the elevator car. However, this is rarely the case, and these are, instead, designed for the use of emergency crews to rescue trapped passengers.

This activity typically takes place when there is not much movement with the elevators, which lowers the risk and involvement. Accomplices will sometimes press buttons on the inside of the elevators to provide the movement. Movement can also be provided by means of service controls located on top of the elevator car, which allow complete control over the movement of the elevator, but at a reduced speed.

'''Estate maps''' were maps commissioned by [[landed gentry|individual landowners]] or institutions, to show their [[Estate (land)|extensive landed property]], typically including fields, [[Designed landscape|parkland]] and buildings. They were used for display and estate management and were fashionable from the 16th to the 19th century. 

==History==
In [[England and Wales]], estate maps began to be produced in large numbers during the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. D. A. |last=Harvey |title=Maps in Tudor England |publisher=Public Record Office/British Library |place=London |year=1993 |isbn=0-7123-0311-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of new estates as a result of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] gave increased impetus to their production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of the Mapmaker in Essex|publisher=Essex County Council|year=1947|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estate maps continued in popularity until the middle of the 19th century, when large scale [[tithe maps|tithe]] and [[Ordnance Survey]] maps became available. The [[English country house#Decline|decline of many country estates]] led to the dismantling of many of the traditional landed estates in the early to mid 20th century.

A few maps were drawn prior to the 16th century, but these were ad hoc, for a particular purpose. Before the emergence of the estate map, [[manor]]s and other estates were usually managed using written documents listing the buildings, fields and tenants. These were known variously as surveys, rentals and extents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. D. A. |last=Harvey |title=Manorial Records |publisher=[[British Records Association]] |series=Archives and the User |volume=5 |year=1984 |place=London |ISBN=0-900222-06-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the adoption of estate maps, the use of mapless surveys continued, although it gradually declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. Sarah |last=Bendall |title=Maps, Land and Society: A History, with a Carto-bibliography, of Cambridgeshire Estate Maps, 1600–1836 |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1992 |isbn=052141055X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surveyor who measured the land for the map could typically survey {{convert|20 |acres}} per day and was paid 6d per acre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essex on the Map|publisher=Essex County Council|year=1990|first=A Stuart|last=Mason|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Estate maps were colourful and often intended for display as well as estate management. "They were drawn and decorated by country surveyors for the information and pleasure of country squires."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lynham in {{cite book|title=Catalogue of maps in the Essex Record Office |editor-first=F. G. |editor-last=Emmison |editor-link=F. G. Emmison |year=1947 |publisher=Essex County Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of scale was down to the individual map maker, but were usually large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sarah |last=Bendall |chapter=Estate Maps |editor1-last=Wallis |editor1-first=Helen |editor1-link=Helen Wallis |editor2-last=McConnell |editor2-first=Anita |title=Historian's Guide to Early British Maps |publisher=[[Royal Historical Society]] |place=London |year=1994 |ISBN=0521551528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings (and trees) were often shown as miniature pictures (in what is sometimes termed a "[[Bird's-eye view#Bird's-flight view|bird's-flight view]]") in early maps, although from the 18th century it became common to depict buildings in plan. "Few land surveyors even attempted to show relief; it was not essential to their purpose of recording boundaries and areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stacey |last=Gee |title=Estate Maps at Guildhall Library |publisher=Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section |origyear=2004 |year=2006 |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/gh/Estate.htm |accessdate=11 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They often had elaborate cartouches giving the name of the estate owner. Typically, little or no detail is shown for land not owned by the person or organisation commissioning the map. Estate maps were frequently accompanied by field books that contained the key to symbols on the map and had information about tenants and crops. Where the field book has not survived, the usefulness of the map is greatly diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essex on the Map |last=Mason |first=A. Stuart |year=1990 |publisher=Essex Record Office |place=Chelmsford |isbn= 0-900360-75-5 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Large numbers of estate maps are found in [[county record office]]s, having been deposited with the accumulated documents of a landed family. Where the estate owner was a corporate body – an [[Oxbridge]] college or a City [[livery company]], for example – their estate maps remain in their own archives. Some estate maps are held in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] – for example where the estate was owned by [[the Crown]], or when it has been the subject of a court case.

==Usage==
Originally, estate maps served two purposes. They were a tool that enabled estate owners to manage and improve their property. In addition they were status symbols that enabled a landowner to display the extent of his property ownership and his authority over his property. Surveying texts became explicit about the need to decorate the maps in a way that emphasised the status of the owner – by the use of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] or depiction of the [[manor house]].

Today, estate maps can be used to investigate land usage and changes in river channels, as well as in [[Conservation and restoration of historic gardens|historic garden conservation]] and other historical interest in [[English country house]]s. An estate map is often useful in determining the history of [[field systems]], as it can be the earliest written evidence of the field system in use in a locality.

This article describes several theories on '''Etymology of [[Kolkata]]''', (erstwhile '''Calcutta''' in English) the capital of the [[India]]n eastern state of [[West Bengal]].

The rent-roll of [[Akbar]], the sixteenth-century [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor, and the work of a Bengali poet, [[Bipradaas]], of the late fifteenth century, both make mention of the city's early name's being ''Kolikata'', from which Kolkata/Calcutta are said to derive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9821/Calcutta Britannica entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is lot of discussion on how the city got its name. There are different views on the issue. The most popular and likely one is that the city got its name from its connection to the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] with the original name's being ''Kalikshetra'', meaning the place of ''Kāli''. Other more or less plausible theories abound, like:
* The name derived from the location of the original settlement beside a ''khal'' ( which means canal in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]) according to another theory, britishers when they visited city, saw the goddess with a skull garland. This reminded them the place golgotha.. Which later became kolkotha. 
* According to another theory, the place was known for the manufacture of shell-lime.And the name derived from lime (''kali'') and burnt shell (''kata'').
* the name '''may''' have been derived from the Bengali term ''kilkila'' ("flat area").&lt;ref name=calcuttawebhistory&gt;{{cite web

| title = Kolkata (Calcutta): History
| publisher=Calcuttaweb.com
| accessdate =2006-06-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An interesting anecdote exists on the nomenclature of Kolkata. According to it, a British merchant was traveling through the village, when he came upon a peasant stacking hay into the barn. Not knowing where he was, the merchant asked the peasant about that place. The peasant, unfortunately, did not understand English, and he guessed that the ''[[Sahib]]'' must be inquiring about the date the crop was harvested. In his own language, he replied ''"Kāl Kāʈa"'' which in [[Bengali language]] means "harvested yesterday" (''Kal'' – Yesterday, ''Kāʈa'' – cut, which here means harvested). The merchant was happy in the knowledge that he had learned about the name of the place, and left the place. Following English [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], "Kāl Kāʈa" became "Calcutta" {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.

The area where the city is now located was originally inhabited by the people of three villages— ''[[Kalikata]]'', ''[[Sutanuti]]'' and ''[[Gobindapur, Kolkata|Gobindapur]]''. However, the boundaries of the three villages gradually became less distinct, and before the [[battle of Plassey]], the city could be divided into four different sub-areas – European Kolkata (Dihi Kolkata), a residential village with some sacred spots (Gobindapur), a traditional Indian market (Bazar Kalikata or Burrabazar) and a riverine mart concentrating on cloth trade (Sutanati).&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji, Dr.S.C. 1991. The Changing Face of Calcutta: An Architectural Approach. Government of West Bengal&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle of Plassey in 1757, the British started rebuilding the city with the notions of making it the capital for their Empire.

The [[Calcutta High Court]] recently ruled (16 May 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Subhrangshu | last = Gupta| title =Job Charnock not Kolkata founder: HC Says city has no foundation day| url =http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030518/nation.htm#3| publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] online edition| date = 2003-05-17| accessdate = 2006-12-17| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Job Charnock]], the Englishman generally believed to be the founder of the Kolkata, is not the founder of the city and that hence Kolkata has no birthday.  According to the Court, the city owes its genesis in the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period and it was an established trading post long before the Slave Dynasty of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], the Portuguese, the French or the British established a modern township there.  References to the existence of an ancient riverine port (named Kalikata) exist in the travel journals of Chinese scholars and Persian merchants dating from centuries [[Common Era|BCE]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]], lists the King of “Vanga” (meaning [[Bengal]]), as having fought alongside the Kauravas in the great war.

In spite of the High Court ruling, the growth of the present city can be dated from 1690, when Job Charnock, an agent of the [[English East India Company]] chose the place for a trade settlement. In 1698, the East India Company bought three villages (Sutanuti, Kalikata and Gobindapur) from a local landlord family of [[Sabarna Roy Choudhury]]. The next year, the company began developing the city as a [[Presidency City]]. In 1727, as per the order of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], a civil court was set up in the city. The Calcutta Municipal corporation (recently renamed as [[Kolkata Municipal Corporation]]) was formed and the city had its first mayor.

'''Federation Park''' is a residential neighbourhood in northwestern [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]].  Federation Park was built to house delegates to the Federal Parliament of the [[West Indies Federation]].  As a result of this, the streets in Federation Park are named for the various territories which made up the Federation.  After the dissolution of the Federation in 1962 the houses in Federation Park were used to house senior [[civil service|civil servants]] and professionals in the government service. 

By the mid-1990s, many of these houses were later sold off to private owners, mainly affluent business persons and non-governmental professionals. Today a fairly large portion of these houses have been either renovated or completely replaced by more modern multimillion-dollar mansions that are rented out to foreign embassies as residences and oil companies to house their expatriate senior staff.

[[File:Batterie du fort du Roule.jpg|thumb|A Battery at the Fort du Roule.]]
The '''Fort du Roule''' is a collection of French and German fortifications built in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries on the Roule mountain in [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] ([[Cherbourg-en-Cotentin]] since 2016).

The first fortifications were built in 1793 to protect the [[Cherbourg Harbour|Bay of Cherbourg]] from English attacks. The current fort, at the top of the mountain, was built between 1853 and 1857 under [[Napoleon III]]. In 1928, the Navy built extensive tunnels under it to store equipment. During the Second World War, the [[Todt Organisation]] built several tunnels, installed [[casemate]]s for artillery, and built gun emplacements. The fort was captured after fierce fighting by the U.S. Army on June 26, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ouest-france.fr/normandie/cherbourg-octeville-50100/un-guide-sur-la-montagne-et-le-fort-du-roule-2853998|title=Un guide sur la montagne et le fort du Roule|date=24 September 2014|website=Ouest France|access-date=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Navy took possession of the site and set up its command post in the first maritime region until 1988, when part of the site became a naval communications center. The School of Military Applications of Atomic Energy uses some of the facilities. The fortifications at the top of the mountain now house the Cherbourg Liberation Museum, and the tunnels leading to the German gun emplacements are open to the public.

This article describes the '''[[geography]] of [[Bermuda]]'''.
{{Wikiatlas|Bermuda}}

==Location==
Bermuda (officially, The Bermuda Islands or The Somers Isles) is an [[British overseas territories|overseas territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]]. Located off the [[east coast of the United States]], it is situated around {{convert|1,770|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Miami]], [[Florida]] and {{convert|1,350|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], west of [[Portugal]], northwest of [[Brazil]], {{convert|1,759|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Cuba]] and north-northeast of [[Puerto Rico]]. The nearest landmass is [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]], about {{convert|1,030|km|mi|abbr=on}} west-northwest (see Geography section below). Although commonly referred to in the singular (i.e., ''The Island'', ''The Rock'', and ''Bermuda''), the territory consists of approximately 138 [[island]]s, with a total area of {{convert|57|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

==Native terrestrial ecology==
[[Image:BDA Aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Bermuda looking west, St. David's and St. George's in foreground]]
Bermuda's ecology has been altered radically since the 16th century by humans and the plants and animals they introduced. Some species had actually become extinct long before this, including the [[short-tailed albatross]], a species which occurs today only in the northern [[Pacific Ocean]].

===Flora===
Of 165 plant species found in Bermuda today, 14 are [[Endemism|endemic]] (others are native), and 25 are endangered. When discovered, about 1505, the island's habitat was dominated by the remnant, [[Old growth forest|old-growth]] forest of Bermuda Juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]''). Underwater archaeology of the caldera basin to the north shows that the area was once densely forested with junipers when it was above sea level. The juniper is an endemic species, though related to species found in North America. Its wood is an unusually deep red, indicative of the high iron content of the island's soil (which is similarly very red). Prior to human settlement, there were several million juniper trees in Bermuda. By the 1830s, large areas of Bermuda had been denuded by the shipbuilding industry. As that industry died out in the 19th century, however, the junipers rapidly recovered their numbers. By 1900, when the human population neared 20,000, the islands were again covered densely with juniper, although many of these were juvenile trees. The respite proved temporary, however. In the 1940s, it was realised that two species of [[scale insect]], ''[[Lepidosaphes newsteadi]]'' and ''[[Carulaspis minima]]'', had accidentally been introduced, and were rapidly killing off the junipers, which had no immunity to their toxicological effect. Attempts were made to control the infestation naturally, which involved the large-scale introduction of [[Coccinellidae|ladybird beetles]] (''Coccinellidae''), but these were to no avail. Over the next decade, roughly 8 million juniper trees were lost to the scales. Motor cars were legalised in Bermuda in 1948, as a result of changes wrought by [[World War II]], and the resultant sprawl of the rapidly growing population (which had reached 60,000 by the 1980s) outward from the pre-war population centres happened simultaneously with the destruction of the forests. Unlike in the 19th century, many plant species that had been introduced, some, like the ''[[Casuarina]]'', specifically to replace the [[windbreak]] lost with the juniper, spread virulently. The juniper grows slowly by comparison to many of the [[introduced species]], and has been unable to thrive in the presence of ''Casuarina'' and [[Brazilian pepper]] trees. Efforts to restore it centre around intensively managed land areas, such as gardens and golf courses. Other large plant species, which were never as numerous as the juniper, had also fared poorly in the presence of invasive species, but have become popular with gardeners and their numbers also have increased in managed areas. These include two native species, the Bermuda olivewood (''[[Elaeodendron laneanum]]''), and the Bermuda palmetto (''[[Sabal bermudana]]''), the only native or endemic palm. In some coastal areas and inland marshes, Bermuda is the most northerly point at which [[mangrove]] trees are found. Smaller plants include many [[fern]]s. Notable among these is the rare Bermuda cave fern (''[[Ctenitis]] [[Ctenitis sloanei|sloanei]]''). An even rarer fern,'' [[Diplazium]] [[Diplazium laffanianum|laffanianum]]'', no longer survives in the wild.  Another native plant is the [[Iris (plant)|iris]] ''Bermudiana'' (''[[Sisyrinchium bermudiana]]''). This was thought to be endemic, but also appears in two locations in [[Ireland]]. Many of the smaller endemic and native plants of Bermuda are rare and endangered, but others have survived and prospered. The common [[Cynodon|Bermuda grass]] is not actually Bermudian, but a Mediterranean import.

===Fauna===
There were few species of land animal in Bermuda before the arrival of humans. The only vertebrate species was the [[Bermuda rock skink|Bermuda skink]], or ''rock lizard'' (''Eumeces longirostris''). These were quite numerous, but have become rare due to predation by introduced species, and, especially, the introduction of glass bottles, in which they easily become trapped. Unlike the introduced [[anole]]s, their feet are unable to adhere to glass. Their range had been largely reduced to small islands of [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]], but they have re-colonised the mainland, and their numbers are increasing. The only other large land animals found on the island were crustaceans, notably two species of land crab, including the rare giant land crab (''Cardisoma quantami''). Insects included the endemic, ground-burrowing solitary bee, which has not been observed for several decades and is believed extinct. The native [[cicada]] also became extinct with the loss of the juniper forest. Other native insects survive, including the migratory [[monarch butterfly]] (''Danaus plexippus''), which has become threatened due to the loss of [[Asclepias|milkweed]], which has been eradicated as a weed. The most numerous animals were, and are, birds. Several native species are related to North American species, including the [[eastern bluebird]] (''Sialia sialis''), and the [[white-eyed vireo]] (''Vireo griseus bermudianus''). Both of these were common, but have suffered from loss of habitat, from competition for nest sites with introduced [[house sparrow]]s (''Passer domesticus''), and nest-predation by [[European starling]]s (''Sturnus vulgaris'') and [[great kiskadee]]s (''Pitangus sulphuratus'') - this last species was deliberately introduced as late as 1957, with the intent that it would control the previously introduced anoles. Other native birds, including the [[grey catbird]], have suffered from the same causes. The most famous Bermudian bird is the endemic [[Bermuda petrel]] (''Pterodroma cahow''), or ''cahow''. This is a pelagic seabird which had dug burrows for its nests. Humans are believed to have killed millions of them after settlement began in 1609, and feral pigs, introduced presumably by Spaniards decades before, also attacked their nests. Before the 17th century was over, the cahow was believed to be extinct. After sightings of the bird at sea, a young Bermudian, [[David B. Wingate]], theorised cahows might still be nesting on rocky islets of Castle Harbour. He visited these islets with ornithologists [[Robert Cushman Murphy]] and Louis S. Mowbray in 1951 and discovered a handful of nesting pairs. Under Wingate's supervision, a conservation programme has steadily increased the cahow's numbers. Species that arrived by natural dispersion and become native after human settlement include the [[barn owl]] (''Tyto alba''), and the [[mourning dove]] (''Zenaida macroura'').

==Introduced flora and fauna==
Since discovery by humans, numerous species have been introduced to the island, some deliberately, like the casurina, the feral pig, the [[Northern cardinal|cardinal]] (''Cardinalis cardinalis''), anoles, ladybird beetles, and the kiskadee, some incidentally, like the [[Brown rat|Norwegian rat]] (''Rattus norvegicus'') and the [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''), and the others accidentally, like the scale mites, and the [[Latrodectus geometricus|brown widow spider]] (''Latrodectus geometricus''). Other imported species include the [[cane toad]] (''Bufo marinus''), and tree frogs.

In addition to casurinas, numerous other species of tree, bush, shrub, cacti, palm, and other grasses have been introduced, with many of them proving to be invasive species. Despite the decimation of the cedar, those parts of the island not covered in buildings and tarmac are now densely covered in trees and shrubbery, including [[allspice]] (''Pimenta dioica ''), fiddlewood, [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island pine]] (''Araucaria heterophylla''), [[Coccoloba uvifera|bay grape]] (''Coccoloba uvifera''), [[Surinam Cherry|Surinam cherry]] (''Eugenia uniflora''), [[Royal Poinciana|poinciana]] (''Delonix regia''), [[Washingtonia|fan palms]], [[coconut palm]] (''Cocos nucifera''), [[Roystonea|royal palm]] (''Roystonea''), [[Pittosporum|pittusporum]], [[Carissa|Natal plum]], [[loquat]] (''Eriobotrya japonica''), [[oleander]] (''Nerium oleander''), and [[hibiscus]]. Most of the introduced species have proved to be unequal to Bermuda's frequently fierce weather. A succession of winter storms and a few powerful hurricanes that have struck over the last two decades have reduced woodlands, and available nest sites for small birds. The number of large trees, particularly, has been reduced. Although cedars are adapted to the local climate, and not so affected by stormy weather, rising sea levels are beginning to inundate the roots of [[Old growth forest|old-growth]] cedars near low-lying [[marsh]]lands, causing many to die.

Many domestic animal species have been introduced, including dogs, horses, goats, sheep, chickens, and cats, with cats long having established a large feral population. [[Feral chickens]] have recently become numerous (since the government ended its policy of allowing members of the local shotgun club to shoot them), and feral rabbits can also be found. Populations of feral guinea pigs have been established and then eradicated. Feral pigs were hunted to extinction centuries ago. Today, introduced feral species, particularly cats, are blamed for falling numbers of native birds, from bluebirds to ''longtails'', but the primary threats are loss of habitat, due now to overdevelopment, and climate change (rising sea levels, increased hurricane activity, and rising temperatures are all having an effect on cahow nests, particularly).

==Climate==
[[Image:Gulf Stream water temperature.jpg|right|thumb|Bermuda's climate is partly determined by its location to the east of the warm, poleward-moving [[Gulf Stream]].]]
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]] Bermuda lies in the transition zone between [[tropical climate]] or Aw and [[humid subtropical climate]] or Cfa. Although Bermuda meets the temperature threshold of a tropical climate (coolest month has a mean temperature of 18 C or higher), the higher latitude of Bermuda (near 34 north) is north of the latitude that most tropical climates are typically found. Bermuda has never experienced a freeze or frost, and winters are quite warm by European and north American standards. 

Bermuda experiences hot and humid summers with the majority of precipitation falling from isolated showers and thunderstorms, and mild winters. Occasional [[Tropical wave|Tropical Waves]] and [[Tropical Cyclones]] can also play a role in summertime precipitation totals when they exit the tropics. Winters are mild to semi-warm, with temperatures rarely falling below {{convert|10|C|F}}. Precipitation in wintertime is controlled by fronts moving eastward from the North American continent and into the Atlantic Ocean. During the peak of winter in Bermuda, these fronts can be followed by northwesterly gales and gusty showers that sometimes contain small hail. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed through the year, but is somewhat less reliable in April and especially May, Bermuda's driest months on average, when the [[Bermuda-Azores High]] can bring extended dry spells. Summers are hot and humid, with frequent intense (but brief) thundershowers. On average, October is the wettest month, and August second wettest. It is not uncommon, during the summer, to ride on sunbaked roads, then round a corner to come suddenly on drenched and steaming tarmac where a shower has passed only minutes earlier.

Bermuda's weather is largely controlled by the position and structure of the Bermuda-Azores High. This semi-permanent high pressure area (often centered southwest of the Azores) extends a ridge westward toward Bermuda during the spring and summer when the high is most intense. Oriented west-to-east to the near south of Bermuda, clockwise flow around the surface high brings [[prevailing winds]] from the southwest for much of the summer and subsequently prevents fronts from reaching the island. However, the ridge sometimes shifts to the north of the island allowing easterly or northeasterly winds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weather.bm/ClimateReport/data/climatology.html&lt;/ref&gt; In fall and winter, the ridge near Bermuda becomes more transient, allowing frontal systems to affect the island. Winds around these systems are much more variable (and often stronger) but typically settle out of the southwest ahead of a cold front and shift to the west or northwest behind a cold front. 

A local weather phenomenon that occurs mainly in late summer is colloquially known as "Morgan's Cloud".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weather.bm/glossary/Glossary.asp&lt;/ref&gt; On otherwise fair, hot summer days with light southwesterly winds, [[convection|convective]] clouds can develop along the length of the island and blow to the northeast growing. In extreme cases, this cloud formation can develop into heavy showers and thunderstorms and it has been known to produce funnel clouds and waterspouts in the eastern parishes. This phenomenon also occurs in the less common northeasterly wind regime ("reverse" Morgan's Cloud) but its effects are felt in the western parishes. The key to Morgan's Cloud forming is light winds blowing along the length of the island which is often warmer than the surrounding waters on hot summer days. This organizes upward motions allowing this cloud formation to occur. Similar localized cloud development is observed in linear tropical and subtropical islands globally. Furthermore, showers following strong cold fronts in wintertime form in a similar manner to [[lake-effect snow]]. Cold air blowing over warm water decreases atmospheric stability, allowing convection to form and grow into showers.

==Human geography==

=== The early colony ===
[[File:Somers Isles Map - John Speed 1676.jpg|thumb|A 1676 map of the Somers Isles (Bermuda) by John Speed, based on the map of surveyor Richard Norwood]]
[[File:Bermuda-divmap.png|thumb|Subdivisions of Bermuda]]
When settled, in the 17th century, first by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]], then by its spin-off, the [[Somers Isles Company]], Bermuda was divided into nine equally sized administrative areas. These comprised one public territory (known as ''St. George's'') and eight "tribes" (soon retitled as "parishes"). These "tribes" were subdivided into lots, separated by narrow ''tribe roads'' (supposedly created by clearing the path of a barrel rolled from the south to north shores). These roads served both to demarcate the boundaries of lots, and also as access routes to the shoreline, as the primary method of transport about Bermuda would remain by boat for the next three centuries. Each of the lots equated to shares in the company. Each of the tribes was named for a major "adventurer" (shareholder) of the Company. Most were nobles, who used the [[toponymy|toponyms]] of their titles, hence most of the parishes bear place names from [[England]], [[Scotland]], or [[Wales]]: ''Devonshire'' (for [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire]], 1552–1626), ''[[Duke of Hamilton|Hamilton]]'' (for [[James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton]], 1589–1625), ''Pembroke'' (for [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], 1580–1630), ''Southampton'' (for [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]], 1573–1624), and ''Warwick'' (for [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick]], 1587–1658). The others are ''Paget'' (for [[William Paget, 4th Baron Paget|William Paget, 4th Baron Paget de Beaudesert]], 1572–1629), ''Sandys'' (for [[Edwin Sandys (died 1629)|Sir Edwin Sandys]], 1561–1629), and Smith's (for [[Thomas Smythe|Sir Thomas Smith]], 1588–1625). Hamilton Parish was originally named ''Bedford'', after [[Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford]], who sold her shares to the Scottish nobleman, James Hamilton. Devonshire Parish had originally been named ''Cavendish Tribe''. The short-lived use of the word "tribes" for administrative regions appears to have been unique to the Bermuda example. The ninth parish was ''common'' (or ''King's'', or ''general'') land, not subdivided by tribe roads, and was named for the [[patron saint]] of England, [[Saint George]]. It includes the island and the town both of the same name.

=== Nomenclature ===
Bermudian convention, where a [[toponym]] contains the name of a person, is to render the person's name in the [[possessive]] form. The place is rarely treated as equivalent to the person.

Among many examples of such place names in Bermuda are [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's Island]], ''Bailey's Bay'', [[Sandys Parish, Bermuda|Sandys' Parish]] (named for [[Edwin Sandys (died 1629)|Sir Edwin Sandys]]), Skeeters' Island (often mistakenly rendered "Skeeter's Island", it is named for ''Edward Skeeters'' and is also known as ''Burt's Island''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bermudapoliceservice.bm/node/101 Bermuda Police Service: History. The Early Years: ''The Death Of Anna Skeeters'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/991-bermudas-true-crime-gothic-tale The Bermudian magazine: ''The Skeeters Murder''. By Sandra Campbell. 15 March, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gibb's Hill'', ''Barr's Bay'', ''Ackermann's Hill'', ''Nelly's Island'', [[Cooper's Island, Bermuda|Cooper's Island]], [[Darrell's Island, Bermuda|Darrell's Island]], ''Paynter's Vale'', ''Abbot's Head'' (or ''Abbot's Cliff''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-2001453&amp;fid=505&amp;c=bermuda Geographic.org. Photius Coutsoukis and Information Technology Associates]&lt;/ref&gt; and Fort St. Catherine's. The possessive form is also used for titles, as with ''Collector's Hill'' (named for the ''Collector of Taxes'').

The use of the possessive form is not exclusive, however, as exemplified by place names such as the names of most of the parishes (which - other than St. George's Parish - all commemorate historical people), such as [[Hamilton Parish, Bermuda|Hamilton Parish]] (named for [[James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton]]), Devonshire Parish (named for), and Paget Parish. Some of these exceptions may have originated with changed syntax, as ''Devonshire Parish'' may originally have been ''The Parish of Devonshire''. This is seen with the ''City of Hamilton'' (named for [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]], a former [[Governor of Bermuda]]). Whereas the City of Hamilton is commonly referred to as ''Hamilton'', The Town of St. George, St. George's Parish, St. George's Island, and St. George's Harbour (and any other toponym usually containing a person's name in the possessive form) always remains possessive when shortened, such as in the ''St. George's Foundation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stgeorgesfoundation.org/ St. George's Foundation website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22362">It is not usual for a [[Chinese Dynasty]] to pass smoothly into the next one, as is depicted in history timelines, since dynasties were often established before the overthrow of an existing clan, or continued for a time after they had been defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=大讀中國  |location= Taiwan |publisher= 千華數位文化|page= 59|isbn=978-986-144-122-1 |author=古利 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Chinese dynasty was the [[Qing Dynasty]], which was abolished in 1912, and there's no officially recognized pretender to the dynasty since as of [[Yongzheng Emperor]]'s reign, the successors' names were written on two scrolls, placed one scroll in a sealed box and had the box stored behind the stele in the [[Qianqing Palace]], and it can be discovered when the emperor deceased or abdicated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.chinaculture.org/library/2008-02/09/content_22919.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The method is known as "The Secret Designation of the Crown Prince" ({{lang-zh|[[w:zh:秘密建儲制|秘密建儲制]]}}).

In dynasties prior to [[Yuan Dynasty]], however, the reigning dynasties often gave title to certain members (sometimes pretenders) of the previous dynasties as recognition of the legitimacy of the former dynasty and the way to show the right to the dynastic change. The method is known as "The two crownings and the three respects" (二王三恪), the people who were given to such position had right to retain the law from the original dynasty within the land given to them, and the reigning emperor couldn't treat them as his subject.&lt;ref name="Cefu"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Cefu Yuangui]]|chapter=173|location=[[Song Dynasty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===[[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]]===
*According to ''[[Book of Documents]]'', [[Emperor Shun]] regarded [[Danzhu]], son of [[Emperor Yao]] as a respectful guest of the court instead of his vassal, and referred him as "Guest of Yu"  (虞賓).&lt;ref&gt;《尚書•虞書》：虞賓在位，群後德讓。&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Xia dynasty]]===
[[Yu the Great]] granted the benefice Tang (唐) to Danzhu (丹朱), and Yu (虞) to Shangjun (商均), son of Emperor Shun. Both of them needn't use the courtesy of a vassal.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', "Basic Annals of the Five Emperors": 譙周云：以虞封舜子，今宋州虞城縣。括地志云：虞國，舜後所封邑也。或雲封舜子均於商，故號商均也。&lt;/ref&gt;

Both monarchs were technically not the vassals of Shang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Book of Rites]]'' by [[Dai De]], :"成湯卒受天命，不忍天下粒食之民刈戮，不得以疾死，故乃放移夏桀，散亡其佐，乃遷姒姓於杞。"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Zuo zhuan]]'', 539 BC: "箕伯、直柄、虞遂、伯戲，其相胡公、大姬，已在齊矣。"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1724, Zhu Zhilian (朱之璉), claimed by Qing government as a descendant of King Jien of Dai ([[w:zh:朱桂|Zhu Gui]], the 14th son of the [[Emperor Taizu of Ming]]), became the first Marquis of Extended Grace.&lt;ref name="BrunnertHagelstrom2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=H.S.

==After 1912==
{{Former monarchic orders of succession}}

===House of Aisin Gioro===
In 1912, the [[Qing dynasty]] was ousted and China was declared a republic.

[[Puyi]], the last Qing emperor, later became the emperor of [[Manchukuo]], now northeastern China, in 1934–1945; he was the only emperor of Manchukuo and the empire was abolished in 1945. He died without issue in 1967. His brother Prince [[Pujie]] was next in line under a 1937 succession law.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchoukuo Year Book 1941'', "Text of the Law Governing Succession to the Imperial Throne", March 1, 1937, p. 905, Tōa Keizai Chōsakyoku (Japan). "In the absence of sons or descendants, the brothers of the reigning emperor, borne of the same mother, and their male-line descendants succeed according to age." (Article 5)&lt;br/&gt;Buyers, Christopher, ''The Royal Ark'', "[http://www.royalark.net/China/china.htm China]".&lt;/ref&gt; Stories published in the ''Chicago Times'' and ''The New York Times'' acknowledge Pujie as heir to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Schmetzer, Uli, "Emperor-in-waiting recalls bygone age", ''Chicago Tribune'', Oct. 25, 1992.&lt;br/&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/02/obituaries/pu-jie-87-dies-ending-dynasty-of-the-manchus.html Pu Jie, 87, Dies, Ending Dynasty Of the Manchus]", ''New York Times'', March 2, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pujie died in 1994. He is survived by a daughter, Princess Husheng, who was born in 1941 and renamed "Kosei Fukunaga" (福永嫮生) when she married to a Japanese in 1968. However, the law restricts succession to males.&lt;ref&gt;"The Imperial Throne of Manchoukuo shall be succeeded to by male descendants in the male line of His Majesty the Emperor for ages to come." (Article 1, "Text of the Law Governing Succession to the Imperial Throne", ''The Manchoukuo Year Book 1941'', p. 905.)&lt;/ref&gt; Several news stories have suggested that [[Jin Yuzhang]], a nephew of Puyi and Pujie, is the current family head of [[House of Aisin Gioro]].&lt;ref name=jinyuzhang&gt;Spencer, Richard, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/3537292/The-Chinese-man-who-would-be-emperor.html The Chinese man who would be emperor]", ''The Telegraph'', 30 Nov 2008.&lt;br /&gt;McDonald, Hamish,

The present line of succession of Aisin Gioro clan goes by:

In ''The Empty Throne'', Tony Scotland tells how he found Prince [[Yuyan]], who lived in a mud floor hovel near the imperial palace.&lt;ref name="Scotland"&gt;Scotland, Tony, and Patrick Leigh Fermor, ''The Empty Throne: Quest for an Imperial Heir in the People's Republic of China'', (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Yuyan, a distant cousin of Puyi, told Scotland that the former emperor made him heir to the throne in a ceremony performed while they were imprisoned in Russia together in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Scotland, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is not supported by any official document, although it was customary in the Qing dynasty that an emperor name his successor in a will or edict. Puyi's autobiography confirms merely that the idea was discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Pu Yi, Paul Kramer, ''The Last Manchu: The Autobiography of Henry Pu Yi, Last Emperor of China'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Yuyan died in 1997. His eldest son is Prince Hengzhen, who was born in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Scotland, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication that Yuyan designated him heir to the throne, or that he claims this status.

===[[Empire of China (1915–16)|Empire of China]]===
In 1915, [[Yuan Shikai]] attempted to reinstate monarchy in China and become the emperor, and his title would be '''Hongxien Emperor'''.  However, due to massive objection across provinces of China, Yuan needed to withdraw his attempt and died in June 6, 1916 as the [[President of the Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="ROCannals"&gt;Kuo T'ing-i et al. ''Historical Annals of the ROC (1911–1949).'' Vol 1. pp 207–41.&lt;/ref&gt; During the preparation of the empire, Yuan planned to make [[Yuan Keding]], his eldest son, the crown prince of Empire of China. Yuan Keding still retained the courtesy of a "crown prince" for decades later even though the empire never existed.&lt;ref name="Yuan"&gt;Chang, Yung-jiu. ''Yuan Shikai Family.'' Chapter 7. pp 207–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuan Keding had a son and two daughters with modern descendants, although he had the other 31 siblings:&lt;ref name="Yuan" /&gt;

==Main features of the policy==
*uniform license for exploration and production of all forms of hydrocarbon  such as coal bed methane, shale gas and oil, tight gas and gas hydrates.

*an open acreage policy that allows companies to select the exploration blocks on their own without waiting for the formal bidding round from the government.

*easy to administer revenue sharing model as the government needs to audit only the production and revenue of companies (not costs). The subjective criterion of cost recovery has ended.

*marketing and pricing freedom for the crude oil and natural gas produced.

'''ISO 3166-2:CL''' is the entry for [[Chile]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Chile, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[regions of Chile|16 regions]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|CL}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Chile. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[File:India Map based on Survey of India rivers.PNG|thumb|right|240px|Map of India based on survey of [[List of major rivers of India|rivers of India]].]]

The '''Indian Rivers Inter-link''' is a proposed large-scale civil engineering project that aims to effectively manage [[water resources in India]] by linking [[List of major rivers of India|Indian rivers]] by a network of reservoirs and canals and so reduce persistent floods in some parts and water shortages in other parts of India.&lt;ref name=nwdagov/&gt;&lt;ref name=jbsp&gt;Jayanta Bandyopadhyay and Shama Perveen (2003), [http://www.soas.ac.uk/water/publications/papers/file38403 The Interlinking of Indian Rivers: Some Questions on the Scientific, Economic and Environmental Dimensions of the Proposal] IIM Calcutta, IISWBM, Kolkata&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inter-link project has been split into three parts: a northern Himalayan rivers inter-link component, a southern Peninsular component and starting 2005, an intrastate rivers linking component.&lt;ref name=nwdareports&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwda.gov.in/index1.asp?linkid=9&amp;langid=1 |title=National water Development Agency (NWDA) Studies|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is being managed by India's National Water Development Agency (NWDA), under its [[Ministry of Water Resources (India)|Ministry of Water Resources]]. NWDA has studied and prepared reports on 14 inter-link projects for Himalayan component, 16 inter-link projects for Peninsular component and 37 intrastate river linking projects.&lt;ref name=nwdareports/&gt;

The average rainfall in India is about 4,000 billion cubic metres, but most of India's rainfall comes over a 4-month period – June through September. Furthermore, the rain across the very large nation is not uniform, the east and north gets most of the rain, while the west and south get less.&lt;ref name=ncaer/&gt;&lt;ref name=iwmi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/IWMI_Research_Reports/PDF/pub083/RR83.pdf |title=Spatial variation in water supply and demand across river basins of India|author=IWMI Research Report 83|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; India also sees years of excess monsoons and floods, followed by below average or late monsoons with droughts. This geographical and time variance in availability of natural water versus the year round demand for irrigation, drinking and industrial water creates a demand-supply gap, that has been worsening with India's rising population.&lt;ref name=iwmi/&gt;

Proponents of the rivers inter-linking projects claim the answers to India's water problem is to conserve the abundant monsoon water bounty, store it in reservoirs, and deliver this water – using rivers inter-linking project – to areas and over times when water becomes scarce.&lt;ref name=ncaer/&gt; Beyond water security, the project is also seen to offer potential benefits to transport infrastructure through navigation, hydro power as well as to broadening income sources in rural areas through fish farming.&lt;ref name=indu/&gt; Opponents are concerned about knowledge gap on environmental, ecological, social displacement impacts as well as unseen and unknown risks associated with tinkering with nature.&lt;ref name=jbsp/&gt; Others are concerned that some projects create international impact and the rights of nations such as Bangladesh must be respected and negotiated.&lt;ref name=misra/&gt;
[[File:India rivers and lakes map.svg|thumb|Map of the major rivers, lakes and reservoirs in India.]]

==History==
;British colonial era
The Inter-linking of Rivers in India proposal has a long history. During the British colonial rule, for example, the 19th century engineer [[Arthur Cotton]] proposed the plan to interlink major Indian rivers in order to hasten import and export of goods from its colony in South Asia, as well as to address water shortages and droughts in southeastern India, now Andhra Pradesh and Orissa.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hope and William Digby, {{Google books|AyoJAQAAIAAJ|General Sir Arthur Cotton, R. E., K. C. S. I.:His Life and Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Post independence
In the 1970s, [[Kanuri Lakshmana Rao|Dr. K.L. Rao]], a dams designer and former irrigation minister proposed "National Water Grid".&lt;ref name=aks/&gt; He was concerned about the severe shortages of water in the South and repetitive flooding in the North every year. He suggested that the Brahmaputra and Ganga basins are water surplus areas, and central and south India as water deficit areas. He proposed that surplus water be diverted to areas of deficit. When Rao made the proposal, several inter-basin transfer projects had already been successfully implemented in India, and Rao suggested that the success be scaled up.&lt;ref name=aks&gt;A.K. Singh (2003), Interlinking of Rivers in India: A Preliminary Assessment, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, India’s Ministry of Water Resources came out with a report entitled "National Perspectives for Water Resources Development". This report split the water development project in two parts – the Himalayan and Peninsular components. Congress Party came to power and it abandoned the plan. In 1982, India financed and set up a committee of nominated experts, through National Water Development Agency (NWDA)&lt;ref name=nwdagov/&gt; to complete detailed studies, surveys and investigations in respect of reservoirs, canals and all aspects of feasibility of inter-linking Peninsular rivers and related water resource management. NWDA has produced many reports over 30 years, from 1982 through 2013.&lt;ref name=nwdagov&gt;[http://nwda.gov.in/ National Water Development Agency] Ministry of Water Resources, Govt of India (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the projects were not pursued.

The river inter-linking idea was revived in 1999, after a new political alliance formed the central government, but this time with a major strategic shift. The proposal was modified to '''intra'''-basin development as opposed to '''inter'''-basin water transfer.&lt;ref name=gourdji&gt;Sharon Gourdji, Carrie Knowlton and Kobi Platt, [http://rivers.snre.umich.edu/ganga/India/RiverLinkingFinal.pdf Indian Inter-linking of Rivers: A Preliminary Evaluation] M.S. Thesis, University of Michigan (May 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

;21st century
[[File:Drought affected area in Karnataka, India, 2012.jpg|thumb|Drought affected area farm lands in [[Karnataka]].]]

By 2004, a different political alliance led by Congress Party was in power, and it resurrected its opposition to the project concept and plans. Social activists campaigned that the project may be disastrous in terms of cost, potential environmental and ecological damage, water table and unseen dangers inherent with tinkering with nature. The central government of India, from 2005 through 2013, instituted a number of committees, rejected a number of reports, and financed a series of feasibility and impact studies, each with changing environmental law and standards.&lt;ref name=gourdji/&gt;&lt;ref name=konka&gt;Koshy &amp; Kanekal, [http://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/n20Rh0ciuVHqoZi8oM6IjL/SC-revives-NDA-dream-to-interlink-rivers.html SC revives NDA dream to interlink rivers] LiveMint &amp; The Wall Street Journal (28 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, while disposing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) lodged in the year 2002, Supreme Court (SC) refused to give any direction for implementation of Rivers Interlinking Project. SC stated that it involves policy decisions which are part of legislative competence of state and central governments. However, SC directed the Ministry of Water Resources to constitute an experts committee to pursue the matter with the governments as no party had pleaded against the implementation of Rivers Interlinking Project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courtnic.nic.in/supremecourt/temp/512200232722012p.txt "Paras 62 to 64, WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 668 OF 2002"], The Supreme Court of India, Civil Original Jurisdiction, Government of India (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The need==
[[File:India flood zone map.svg|thumb|Map showing rivers and flood prone areas in India]]
{{See also |Pollution of the Ganges#Ganga Manthan}}
;Drought, floods and shortage of drinking water
India receives about 4,000 cubic kilometers of rain annually, or about 1 million gallons of fresh water ''per person'' every year.&lt;ref name=jbsp/&gt; However, the precipitation pattern in India varies dramatically across distance and over calendar months. Much of the precipitation in India, about 85%, is received during summer months through monsoons in the Himalayan catchments of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basin. The northeastern region of the country receives heavy precipitation, in comparison with the northwestern, western and southern parts. The uncertainty of start date of monsoons, sometimes marked by prolonged dry spells and fluctuations in seasonal and annual rainfall is a serious problem for the country.&lt;ref name=nwdagov/&gt; The nation sees cycles of drought years and flood years, with large parts of west and south experiencing more deficits and large variations, resulting in immense hardship particularly the poorest farmers and rural populations. Lack of irrigation water regionally leads to crop failures and farmer suicides. Despite abundant rains during July–September, some regions in other seasons see shortages of drinking water. Some years, the problem temporarily becomes too much rainfall, and weeks of havoc from floods.&lt;ref name="cwc.gov.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwc.gov.in/main/downloads/FFM.2200-2291.27112012.pdf|title= State wise flood damage statistics in India|date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This excess-scarcity regional disparity and flood-drought cycles have created the need for water resources management. Rivers inter-linking is one proposal to address that need.&lt;ref name=nwdagov/&gt;&lt;ref name=jbsp/&gt;

;Population and food security 
Population increase in India is the other driver of need for river inter-linking. India's population growth rate has been falling, but still continues to increase by about 10 to 15 million people every year. The resulting demand for food must be satisfied with higher yields and better crop security, both of which require adequate irrigation of about 140 million hectares of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Lester R.

River inter-linking is claimed to be a possible means of assured and better irrigation for more farmers, and thus better [[food security]] for a growing population.&lt;ref name=nwdagov/&gt; In a tropical country like India with high [[evapotranspiration]], food security can be achieved with [[water security]] which in turn is achieved with [[Energy policy of India#Solar energy|energy security]] to pump water to uplands from water surplus lower elevation river points up to sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/why-rains-will-not-solve-the-countrys-growing-ground-water-problems/articleshow/52664098.cms|title= Why rains will not solve the country's growing ground water problems|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Salt export needs
When sufficient [[Dissolved load|salt export]] is not taking place from a [[river basin]] to the sea in an attempt to harness the river water fully, it leads to river basin closer and the available water in downstream area of the river basin becomes [[Saline water|saline]] and/ or [[alkaline water]]. Land irrigated with saline or alkaline water becomes gradually in to [[Soil salinity control|saline]] or [[alkali soil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irrisoft.org/cms/fileadmin/content/zfb/1998_02/keller_keller_davids_1998_river_basin_development_phases_implications_closure.pdf|title=River basin development phases and implications of closure |author1=J.

Proliferation of alkali soils would compel the farmers to cultivate [[rice]] or  [[grasses]] only as the soil productivity is poor with other crops and tree [[plantation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/umatilla/mf/sites/default/files/pnw597-e.pdf|title=Managing irrigation water quality|author=Oregon State University, USA|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cotton]] is the preferred crop in saline soils compared to many other crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://222065430381538974.weebly.com/uploads/1/1/5/2/11520542/irrigation_water_quality_-_salinity_-_derm.pdf|title=Irrigation water quality—salinity and soil structure stability |accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interlinking water surplus rivers with water deficit rivers is needed  for the long term sustainable productivity of the river basins and for mitigating the [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic influences]] on the rivers by allowing adequate salt export to the sea in the form of [[environmental flow]]s.

;Navigation
India needs infrastructure for logistics and movement of freight. Using connected rivers as navigation is a cleaner, low carbon footprint form of transport infrastructure, particularly for ores and food grains.&lt;ref name=indu/&gt;&lt;ref name=nwdagov/&gt;

;Current reserves and loss in groundwater level
[[File:Mass Balance Change over India from GRACE.ogv|thumb|India's worsening water problem – satellite evidence of critical groundwater levels. The blue and purple regions have greatest levels of groundwater depletion. Courtesy – Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA, United States (2010).]]
India currently stores only 30 days of rainfall, while developed nations strategically store 900 days worth of water demand in arid areas river basins and reservoirs. India’s dam reservoirs store only 200 cubic meters per person. India also relies excessively on groundwater, which accounts for over 50 percent of irrigated area with 20 million tube wells installed. About 15 percent of India’s food is being produced using rapidly depleting groundwater. The end of the era of massive expansion in groundwater use is going to demand greater reliance on surface water supply systems. Proponents of the project suggest India's water situation is already critical, and it needs sustainable development and management of surface water and groundwater usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/06/25/000333037_20080625020800/Rendered/PDF/443760PUB0IN0W1Box0327398B01PUBLIC1.pdf |title=India’s water economy bracing for a turbulent future, World Bank report, 2006|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents feel that India is not running out of water but water is running out of India&lt;ref name=east&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/390880621/Feasibility-of-coastal-reservoir-to-harness-Brahmaputra-and-Ganga-surplus-waters |title=Feasibility of coastal reservoir to harness Brahmaputra and Ganga surplus waters|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=indu/&gt;&lt;ref name=gokr/&gt;

==Plan==
The National perspective plan envisions about 150 million acre feet (MAF) (185 billion cubic metres) of water storage along with building inter-links.&lt;ref name=NPWR&gt;[http://nwda.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/2175421921.pdf National perspectives for water resources development (accessdate 12 June 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;  These storages and the interlinks will add nearly 170 million acre feet of water for beneficial uses in India, enabling irrigation over an additional area of 35 million hectares, generation of 40,000 MW capacity hydro power, flood control and other benefits.

The total surface water available to India is nearly 1440 million acre feet (1776 billion cubic meters) of which only 220 million acre feet was being used in the year 1979. The rest is neither utilized nor managed, and it causes disastrous floods year after year. Up to 1979, India had built over 600 storage dams with an aggregate capacity of 171 billion cubic meters. These small storages hardly enable a seventh of the water available in the country to be utilized beneficially to its fullest potential.&lt;ref name= NPWR/&gt; From India-wide perspective, at least 946 billion cubic meters of water flow annually could be utilized in India, power generation capacity added and perennial inland navigation could be provided. Also some benefits of flood control would be achieved. The project claims that the development of the rivers of the sub-continent, each state of India, as well as its international neighbors stand to gain by way of additional irrigation, hydro power generation, navigation and flood control.&lt;ref name= NPWR/&gt; The project may also contribute to food security to the anticipated [[Demographic transition|population peak]] of India.&lt;ref name= NPWR/&gt;

The Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna is a major international drainage basin which carries more than 1,000 million acre feet out of total 1440 million acre feet in India. Water is a scarce commodity and several basins such as Cauvery, Yamuna, Sutlej, Ravi and other smaller inter-State/intra-State rivers are short of water. 99 districts of the country are classified as drought prone, an area of about 40 million hectare is prone to recurring floods.&lt;ref name=NPWR/&gt; The inter-link project is expected to help reduce the scale of this suffering and associated losses.

The National Perspective Plan comprised, starting 1980s, of two main components:
#Himalayan Rivers Development, and
#Peninsular Rivers Development

An intrastate component was added in 2005.

===Himalayan component===
[[File:Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Map of the Ganges (orange), Brahmaputra (violet), and Meghna (green) drainage basins.]]

Himalayan Rivers Development envisages construction of storage reservoirs on the main Ganga and the Brahmaputra and their principal tributaries in India and Nepal along with inter-linking canal system to transfer surplus flows of the eastern tributaries of the Ganga to the West apart from linking of the main Brahmaputra with the Ganga.&lt;ref name= NPWR/&gt; Apart from providing irrigation to an additional area of about 22 million hectares the generation of about 30 million kilowatt of hydro-power, it will provide substantial flood control in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basin. The Scheme will benefit not only the States in the Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin, but also Nepal and Bangladesh, assuming river flow management treaties are successfully negotiated.&lt;ref name=NPWR/&gt;

The Himalayan component would consist of a series of dams built along the [[Ganga]] and [[Brahmaputra]] rivers in India, [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]] for the purposes of storage.  Canals would be built to transfer surplus water from the eastern tributaries of the Ganga to the west.  This is expected to contribute to flood control measures in the Ganga and Brahmaputra river basins.  It could also provide excess water for the [[Farakka Barrage]] to flush out the silt at the port of [[Kolkata]].

By 2015, fourteen inter-links under consideration for Himalayan component are as follows, with feasibility study status identified:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Himalayan_Component Himalayan Component] WRIS, Govt of India (Accessed: 27 November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwda.gov.in/index2.asp?slid=110&amp;sublinkid=29&amp;langid=1 Himalayan Component Link Proposal] NWDA, Govt of India (Accessed: June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peninsular Component===
This Scheme is divided in four major parts.  
#Interlinking of Mahanadi-Godavari-Krishna-Palar-Pennar-Kaveri,
#Interlinking of West Flowing Rivers, North of Mumbai and South of Tapi,
#Inter-linking of Ken with Chambal and
#Diversion of some water from West Flowing Rivers

This component will irrigate an additional 25 million hectares by surface waters, 10 million hectares by increased use of ground waters and generate hydro power, apart from benefits of improved flood control and regional navigation.&lt;ref name= NPWR/&gt;

The main part of the project would send water from the eastern part of India to the south and west.&lt;ref name= NPWR/&gt;  The southern development project (Phase I) would consist of four main parts. First, the [[Mahanadi]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]]. [[Krishna river|Krishna]] and [[Kaveri]] rivers would all be inter-linked by canals.  Reservoirs and dams would be built along the course of these rivers. These would be used to transfer surplus water from the Mahanadi and Godavari rivers to the south of India.  Under Phase II, some rivers that flow west to the north of [[Mumbai]] and the south of [[Tapti River|Tapi]] would be inter-linked. The water would supply additional drinking water needs of Mumbai and provide irrigation in the coastal areas of [[Maharashtra]]. In Phase 3, the [[Ken River|Ken]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers would be inter-linked to serve regional water needs of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Over Phase 4, a number of west-flowing rivers in the [[Western Ghats]], would be inter-linked for irrigation purposes to east flowing rivers such as Kaveri and Krishna.

The 800-km long [[Mahanadi]]-[[Godavari]] interlinking project would link River [[Sankosh]] originating from [[Bhutan]] to the Godavari in [[Andhra Pradesh]] through rivers like [[Teesta]]-[[Mahananda River|Mahananda]]-[[Subarnarekha River|Subarnarekha]] and Mahanadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Centre revises river linking project |url=http://timesofindia.com/city/bhubaneswar/Centre-revises-river-linking-project/articleshow/50844861.cms |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=4 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intra-state inter-linking of rivers===
India approved and commissioned NDWA in June 2005 to identify and complete feasibility studies of intra-State projects that would inter-link rivers within that state.&lt;ref name=nwdaintra/&gt; The Governments of Nagaland, Meghalaya, Kerala, Punjab, Delhi, Sikkim, Haryana, Union Territories of Puducherry, Andaman &amp; Nicobar islands, Daman &amp; Diu and Lakshadweep responded that they have no intrastate river connecting proposals. Govt. of Puducherry proposed Pennaiyar – Sankarabarani link (even though it is not an intrastate project). The States Government of Bihar proposed 6 inter-linking projects, Maharashtra 20 projects, Gujarat 1 project, Orissa 3 projects, Rajasthan 2 projects, Jharkhand 3 projects and Tamil Nadu proposed 1 inter-linking proposal between rivers inside their respective territories.&lt;ref name=nwdaintra&gt;[http://nwda.gov.in/index2.asp?slid=272&amp;sublinkid=85&amp;langid=1 National water Development Agency (NWDA) Studies] Govt of India (Accessdate=9 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, NDWA completed feasibility studies on the projects, found 1 project infeasible, 20 projects as feasible, 1 project was withdrawn by Government of Maharashtra, and others are still under study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nwda.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/1561705958.pdf Intra – State river link proposals received from the State Governments] NDWA, Government of India (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Rivers Inter-link project is similar in scope and technical challenges as other major global river inter-link projects, such as:

#[[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal]] – completed in 1992, and also called the Europa Canal, it inter-links the [[Main (river)|Main]] river to the [[Danube]] river, thus connecting [[North Sea]] and Atlantic Ocean to the [[Black Sea]]. It provides a navigable artery between the Rhine delta at Rotterdam in the [[Netherlands]] to the Danube Delta in eastern [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ein Traum wird Wirklichkeit" Die Fertigstellung des Main-Donau-Kanals (A Dream Becomes Reality: the Completion of the Main-Danube Canal), Siegfried Zelnhefer, July 1992&lt;/ref&gt; It is 171&amp;nbsp;km long, has the summit altitude (between the Hilpoltstein and Bachhausen locks) is 406 m above sea level, the highest point on Earth reachable by ships from the sea. In 2010, the inter-link provided navigation for 5.2 million tonnes of goods, mostly food, agriculture, ores and fertilizers, reducing the need for 250,000 truck trips per year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsd-sued.wsv.de/wir_fuer_sie/publikationen/pdf/verkehrsbericht_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The canal is also a source for irrigation, industrial water and power generation plants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zaoerv.de/41_1981/41_1981_4_a_731_807.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Illinois Waterway]] system consists of 541 kilometres of interlink that connects a system of rivers, lakes, and canals to provide a shipping connection from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] via the [[Mississippi River]]. It provides a navigation route; primary cargoes are coal to powerplants, chemicals and petroleum upstream, and agriculture produce downstream primarily for export.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]].

===Ecological and environmental issues===
{{See also|Coastal reservoir}}
Some activists and scholars have, between 2002 and 2008, questioned the merits of Indian rivers inter-link projects, and questioned if appropriate study of benefits and risks to environment and ecology has been completed so far. Bandyopadhyay et al. claim there are knowledge gaps between the claimed benefits and potential threats from environment and ecological impact.&lt;ref name=jbsp/&gt; They also question whether the inter-linking project will deliver the benefits of flood control. Vaidyanathan claimed, in 2003, that there are uncertainty and unknowns about operations, how much water will be shifted and when, whether this may cause water logging, salinity/alkalinity and the resulting desertification in the command areas of these projects.&lt;ref&gt;Vaidyanathan,  (2003) ‘Interlinking of Rivers’ The Hindu, 26 March&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have asked whether there are other technologies to address the cycle of droughts and flood havoc's, with less uncertainties about potential environmental and ecological impact.&lt;ref&gt;Monirul Qader Mirza et al., Interlinking of Rivers in India: Issues and Concerns, {{ISBN|978-0415404693}}, Taylor &amp; Francis, page xi&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers may change their courses every (approximately) 100 years, so the interlinking may not be useful after 100 years. Interlinking may also lead to deforestation and cause ecological imbalances.  Construction of environmentally benign multi purpose fresh water [[coastal reservoir]]s with massive storage capacities to inter link the Indian rivers can fully meet irrigation, domestic, industrial, ecological, environmental, etc water requirements without social displacement impacts, poor river and ground water quality impacts and land or forest submergence with cheaper initial and operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Efficacy of coastal reservoirs to address India’s water shortage by impounding excess river flood waters near the coast (pages 49 and 19) |url=http://ojs.udspub.com/index.php/jsupp/issue/viewIssue/51/4|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Association for Coastal Reservoir Research|url=http://iacrr.org/publications|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  India is not running out of water whereas water is running out of India without extracting its full potential benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=India is not running out of water, water is running out of India|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/opinion/op-ed/260317/by-invitation-india-is-not-running-out-of-water-water-is-running-out-of-india.html|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gokr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/389150657/Feasibility-of-coastal-reservoir-to-harness-Godavari-river-surplus-waters |title=Feasibility of coastal reservoir to harness Godavari river surplus waters|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=east/&gt;

===Displacement of people and fisheries profession===
Water storage and distributed reservoirs are likely to displace people – a rehabilitation process that has attracted concern of sociologists and political groups. Further, the inter-link would create a path for aquatic ecosystems to migrate from one river to another, which in turn may affect the livelihoods of people who rely on fishery as their income. Lakra et al., in their 2011 study, claim&lt;ref&gt;Lakra et al, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-011-9199-5 River inter linking in India: status, issues, prospects and implications on aquatic ecosystems and freshwater fish diversity], Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries, September 2011, Volume 21, Issue 3, pp 463-479&lt;/ref&gt; large dams, interbasin transfers and water withdrawal from rivers is likely to have negative as well as positive impacts on freshwater aquatic ecosystem. As regards to the impact on fish and aquatic biodiversity, there could be positive as well as negative impacts.

===Poverty and population issues===
India has a growing population, and large impoverished rural population that relies on monsoon-irrigated agriculture. Weather uncertainties, and potential climate change induced weather volatilities, raise concerns of social stability and impact of floods and droughts on rural poverty. The population of India is expected to grow further at a decelerating pace and stabilize around 1.5 billion by 2050, or another 300 million people – the size of United States – compared to the 2011 census. This will increase demand for reliable sources of food and improved agriculture yields – both of which, claims India's National Council of Applied Economic Research,&lt;ref name=ncaer&gt;Suman Bery, [http://www.nwda.gov.in/writereaddata/mainlinkfile/File277.pdf Economic Impact of Interlinking of Rivers Programme] NCAER, India&lt;/ref&gt; require significantly improve irrigation network than the current state. The average rainfall in India is about 4,000 billion cubic metre, of which annual surface water flow in India is estimated at 1,869 billion cubic metre. Of this, for topological and other reasons, only about 690 billion cubic metre of the available surface water can be utilised for irrigation, industrial, drinking and ground water replenishment purposes. In other words, about 1,100 billion cubic metre of water is available, on average, every year for irrigation in India.&lt;ref name=ncaer/&gt; This amount of water is adequate for irrigating 140 million hectares. As of 2007, about 60% of this potential was realized through irrigation network or natural flow of Indian rivers, lakes and adoption of pumps to pull ground water for irrigation.

80% of the water India receives through its annual rains and surface water flow, happens over a 4-month period – June through September.&lt;ref name=ncaer/&gt;&lt;ref name="iwmi"/&gt; This spatial and time variance in availability of natural water versus year round demand for irrigation, drinking and industrial water creates a demand-supply gap, that only worsens with India's rising population. Proponents claim the answers to India's water problem is to conserve the abundant monsoon water bounty, store it in reservoirs, and use this water in areas which have occasional inadequate rainfall, or are known to be drought-prone or in those times of the year when water supplies become scarce.&lt;ref name=ncaer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monirul Qader Mirza et al., Interlinking of Rivers in India: Issues and Concerns, {{ISBN|978-0415404693}}, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt;

===International issues===
Misra et al. in their 2007 report,&lt;ref name=misra&gt;Misra et al., [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00254-006-0434-7 Proposed river-linking project of India: a boon or bane to nature], Environmental Geology, February 2007, Volume 51, Issue 8, pp 1361-1376&lt;/ref&gt; claim inter-linking of rivers initially appears to be a costly proposition in ecological, geological, hydrological and economical terms, in the long run the net benefits coming from it will far outweigh these costs or losses. However, they suggest that there is a lack of an international legal framework for the projects India is proposing. In at least some inter-link projects, neighboring countries such as Bangladesh may be affected, and international concerns for the project must be negotiated.

===Technological developments===
Cost of power generation by [[Solar power in India|solar power projects]] would be below Rs. 1.0 per Kwh in few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/mexico-auction-bids-lowest-solar-wind-price-on-the-planet#gs.Tm12cfs |title=Mexico’s Energy Auction Just Logged the Lowest Solar Power Price on the Planet |accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Birth of a New Era in Solar PV — Record Low Cost On Saudi Solar Project Bid |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/10/07/the-birth-of-a-new-era-in-solar-pv-record-low-cost-on-saudi-solar-project-bid/ |accessdate= 7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Availability of cheaper, clean and perennial/renewable power would favour more water lifting/pumping and tunnels in the river link projects rather than purely gravity links to economise on cost, reduce construction time and reduce land submergence by optimum use of existing reservoirs/less storage, etc. [[Tunnel]]ling technology/methodology has also undergone drastic improvements to make them alternate choice to the gravity open canal links with shortest distance and cost effective manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gokunming.com/en/blog/item/4038/china_considering_plan_to_make_xinjiang_desert_a_new_california  |title=China considering plan to make Xinjiang desert a new California |accessdate=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=indu&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/365955283/Harnessing-gigantic-hydro-power-potential-of-Indus-Jhelum-and-Chenab-rivers-in-India  |title=Harnessing gigantic hydro power potential of Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers in India |accessdate=30 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
[[Bhartiya Janta Party|BJP]]-led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA]] government of [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] had propagated the idea of interlinking of rivers to deal with the problem of drought and different parts of the country at the same time.&lt;ref name=konka/&gt;

The [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] general secretary [[Rahul Gandhi]] said in 2009 that the entire idea of interlinking of rivers was dangerous and that he was opposed to interlinking of rivers as it would have "severe" environmental implications.  [[Jairam Ramesh]], a cabinet minister in former [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA]] government, said the idea of interlinking India's rivers was a "disaster", putting a question mark on the future of the ambitious project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/interlinking-of-rivers-buried-jairam-says-idea-a-disaster/525654/ Interlinking of rivers buried, Jairam says idea a disaster] Indian Express (6 October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karunanidhi]], whose [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] has been a key ally of the Congress-led [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA]] at the Centre, wrote that linking rivers at the national level perhaps is the only permanent solution to the water scarcity problem in the country.Karunanidhi said the government should make an assessment of the project's feasibility starting with the south-bound rivers. [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] for 2014 general elections added Nationalisation and inter-linking of rivers to its manifesto.

[[Kalpasar Project]] is an irrigation project which envisages storing  [[Narmada River]] water in an off-shore fresh water reservoir located in [[Gulf of Khambhat]] sea for further pumping to arid [[Sourashtra]] region for irrigation use. It is one of the preferred project for implementation by the Prime Minister of India, [[Narendra Modi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Kalpasar-to-break-ground-in-2013/articleshow/11174614.cms |title=Kalpasar to break ground in 2013|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progress==
On 16 September 2015, first linking was completed of rivers [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Godavari River|Godavari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Balachandran|first=Manu|title=Why India’s $168 billion river-linking project is a disaster-in-waiting|url=http://scroll.in/article/756838/why-indias-168-billion-river-linking-project-is-a-disaster-in-waiting|publisher=Scroll.in|date=21 September 2015|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still under review. But it's considered as a true not river interlinking as it is just a small lift irrigation with few lines of pipes.

{{refimprove|date=August 2013}}
{{Indigenous Peoples of Canada}}
In [[Canada]], an '''Indian reserve''' ({{lang-fr|réserve indienne}}) is specified by the ''[[Indian Act]]'' as a "tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in [[The Crown|Her Majesty]], that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a [[band government|band]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/page-1.html?txthl=tract+lands+land#s-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[First Nations]] reserves are the areas set aside for First Nations people after a contract with the Canadian state ("the Crown"), and are not to be confused with [[land claim]]s areas, which involve all of that First Nations' traditional lands: a much larger territory than any other reserve.

== Demographics ==
A single "band" (First Nations government) may control one reserve or several, in addition some reserves are shared between multiple bands. In 2003, the [[Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada|Department of Indian and Northern Affairs]] stated there were 2,300 reserves in Canada, comprising {{convert|28000|km2}}.{{sfn|DIAND|2003|page=2}}  According to Statistics Canada in 2011, there are more than 600 First Nations/Indian bands in Canada and [[List of Indian reserves in Canada|3,100 Indian reserves]] across Canada.{{sfn|StatsCan|2011}} Examples include the [[Sturgeon Lake First Nation]], which like many bands, has only one reserve, [[Sturgeon Lake First Nation|Sturgeon Lake Indian Reserve No. 101]]. [[Musqueam Indian Reserve No. 2|Musqueam No. 2]] and [[Musqueam Indian Reserve No. 4|No. 4]], and [[Sea Island Indian Reserve No. 3]] are governed by the [[Musqueam Indian Band]], one of many examples where a single government is responsible for more than one reserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/FNP/Main/Search/FNReserves.aspx?BAND_NUMBER=550&amp;lang=eng Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Reserves/Settlements/Villages Detail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235045/http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/FNP/Main/Search/FNReserves.aspx?BAND_NUMBER=550&amp;lang=eng |date=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, 60 percent of [[status Indians]] lived on reserves.{{sfn|DIAND|2003|page=2}}

Of the 637,660 First Nations people who reported being Registered Indians, nearly one-half (49.3%) lived on an Indian reserve. This proportion varies across the country.{{sfn|StatsCan|2011b}}

Many reserves have no resident population; typically they are small, remote, non-contiguous pieces of land, a fact which has led many to be abandoned, or used only seasonally (as a [[trapping territory]], for example). Statistics Canada counts only those reserves which are populated (or potentially populated) as [[census subdivisions of Canada|"subdivisions" for the purpose of the national census]]. For the 2011 census, of the more than 3,100 Indian reserves across Canada, there were only 961 Indian reserves classified as census subdivisions (including the 6 reserves added for 2011).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/92-195-x/2011001/geo/csd-sdr/def-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Some reserves that were originally rural were gradually surrounded by urban development. Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary are examples of cities with urban reserves.

== Governance ==
One band Chief and Council commonly administer more than one reserve such as the [[Beaver Lake Cree Nation]] with two reserves, or the [[Lenape]] people, who are in Canada incorporated as the [[Munsee-Delaware Nation]] and who occupy [[Munsee-Delaware Nation 1, Ontario|Munsee-Delaware Nation Indian Reserve No. 1]], consists of three non-contiguous parcels of land totally 1054 hectares within the [[Chippewas of the Thames First Nation 42, Ontario|Chippewas of the Thames First Nation 42]] near [[Muncy, Ontario]], which was formerly shared between them and the [[Chippewas of the Thames First Nation]] as a single parcel of land.  Some reserves are shared by multiple bands, whether as fishing camps or educational facilities such as [[Peckquaylis]], a reserve on the [[Fraser River]] which is used by 21 [[band government|Indian band]]s; it was formerly [[St. Mary's Indian Residential School]] and is an example of a reserve created in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|59960|Pekw'Xe:yles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/fnp/Main/Search/RVDetail.aspx?RESERVE_NUMBER=09657&amp;lang=eng Indian and Northern Affairs Canada - Reserves/Settlements/Villages detail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302203119/http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/fnp/Main/Search/RVDetail.aspx?RESERVE_NUMBER=09657&amp;lang=eng |date=March 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another multi-band reserve of the [[Sto:lo]] peoples is [[Grass Indian Reserve No. 15]], which is located in the City of [[Chilliwack]] and is shared by nine bands.

== ''Constitution Act 1867'' ==
In 1867, legislative jurisdiction over "Indians and Lands reserved for the Indians" was assigned to the Parliament of Canada through the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-1.html Constitution Act, 1867] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531065200/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-1.html |date=May 31, 2012 }}'',  30 &amp; 31 Victoria, c. 3 (U.K.), R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; a major part of Canada's [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], originally known as the ''British North America Act'' (BNA), which acknowledged that First Nations had special status. Separate powers covered "status and civil rights on the one hand and Indian lands on the other."{{sfn|GC|1870}}{{sfn|GC|1867|loc=s.146}}

In 1870, the newly formed Dominion government acquired [[Rupert's Land]], a vast territory in [[British North America]], consisting mostly of the [[Hudson Bay drainage basin]], that had been controlled by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] under its Charter with the British Crown from 1670-1870. Numerous aboriginal groups lived in the same territory and disputed the sovereignty of the area. The Dominion of Canada promised Britain to honour the provisions of the Proclamation of 1763 to "negotiate with its Amerindians for the [[Aboriginal title#extinguishment|extinguishment]] of their title and the setting aside of reserves for their exclusive use." This promise led to the numbered treaties.{{sfn|Dickason|2009|page=241}}

== Treaties and reserves, pre-1867 ==
After the Royal Proclamation and before Confederation in 1867 the Upper Canada Treaties (1764–1862 Ontario) and the [[Douglas Treaties]] (1850-1854 British Columbia) treaties were signed. "Some of these pre-confederation and post-confederation treaties addressed reserve lands, hunting, fishing, trapping rights, annuities and other benefits."{{sfn|DIAND|2003|page=1}}  Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] of British Columbia, which formally became a colony in 1858, also worked to establish many reserves on the mainland during his tenure, though most of these were overturned by successor colonial governments and later royal commissions once the province joined Confederation in 1871.

== Numbered treaties, 1871–1921 ==
Between 1871 and 1921, through numbered treaties with First Nations, the Canadian government  gained large areas of land for settlers and for industry in Northwestern Ontario, Northern Canada and in the Prairies. The treaties, also called the Land Cession or Post-Confederation Treaties,{{sfn|Robert|2001-5}} [[Treaty 1]] was a controversial agreement established August 3, 1871, between [[Queen Victoria]] and various [[First nations|First Nations]] in southeastern [[Manitoba]], including the [[Chippewa]] and Swampy [[Cree]] tribes. Treaty 1 First Nations comprise the [[Brokenhead Ojibway Nation]], Fort Alexander ([[Sagkeeng First Nation]]), [[Long Plain First Nation]], [[Peguis First Nation]], [[Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation]], [[Sandy Bay First Nation]] and [[Swan Lake First Nation]].

== The ''Indian Act 1876'' ==
The rights and freedoms of Canada's First Nations people have been governed by the ''Indian Act'' since its enactment in 1876{{sfn|Clegg|1982}} by the Parliament of Canada. The provisions of Section 91(24) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', provided Canada's federal government exclusive authority to legislate in relation to "Indians and Lands Reserved for Indians".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/const/const1867.html Constitution Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810164041/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/const/const1867.html |date=August 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikwemikong]] Unceded Reserve on [[Manitoulin Island]] is subject to the ''Indian Act'' provisions governing reserves even though its lands were never ceded to the Crown by treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== ''Indian Act'' ==
The Indian Act gives the [[Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Aboriginal Affairs]] the right to "determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used is for the use and benefit of the band."&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/page-10.html#h-13 Indian Act]&lt;/ref&gt; Title to land within the reserve may be transferred to only the band or to individual band members.  Reserve lands may not be seized legally, nor is the personal property of a  band or a band member living on a reserve subject to "charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure distress or execution in favour or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band" (section 89 (1) of the{{sfn|GCa|1985}} {{citation|url=http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/I-5/|title=Indian Act|year=1985|last=GCa|publisher=Government of Canada|ref={{sfnref|GCa|1985}} }}.

=== Housing loans ===
While the ''Act'' was intended to protect the Indian holdings, the limitations make it difficult for the reserves and their residents to obtain financing for development and construction, or renovation.  To answer this need, [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] (CMHC) has created an on-reserve housing loan program.  Members of bands may enter into a trust agreement with CMHC, and lenders can receive loans to build or repair houses. In other programs, loans to residents of reserves are guaranteed by the federal government.

Provinces and municipalities may expropriate reserve land only if specifically authorized by a provincial or federal law. Few reserves have any economic advantages, such as resource revenues. The revenues of those reserves which do are held in trust by the minister of Indian Affairs. Reserve lands and the personal property of bands and resident band members are exempt from all forms of taxation except local taxation.

Corporations owned by members of First Nations are not exempt, however. This exemption has allowed band members operating in proprietorships or partnerships to sell heavily taxed goods, such as cigarettes, on their reserves at prices considerably lower than those at stores off the reserves. Most reserves are self-governed, within the limits already described, under guidelines established by the Indian Act.

Due to treaty settlements, some Indian reserves are now incorporated as villages, such as [[New Aiyansh]], British Columbia, which like other [[Nisga'a]] reserves was relieved of that status by the [[Nisga'a Treaty]].  Similarly, the Indian reserves of the [[Sechelt Indian Band]] are now Indian government districts.

== Public policy ==
Indian reserves play a very important role in public policy stakeholder consultations, particularly when reserves are located in areas that have valuable natural resources with potential for economic development. Beginning in the 1970s, First Nations gained "recognition of their constitutionally protected rights."{{sfn|Henriques|Sadorsky|2004|12}} First Nations' rights are protected by section 35 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982''. By 2002, (Valiente) First Nations had already "finalised 14 comprehensive land claims and self-government agreements, with numerous others, primarily in northern Canada and British Columbia, at different stages of negotiations." Land claims and self-government agreements are "modern treaties" and therefore hold constitutional status.

=== CEPA 1999 ===
The ''[[Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999]]'' (CEPA), "places aboriginal participation on par with federal ministers and the provinces in the National Advisory Committee."{{sfn|Henriques|Sadorsky|2004|12}} Among other things, CEPA clarified the term "aboriginal land" in 3 (1): "The definitions in this subsection apply in this Act. "aboriginal land" means (a) reserves, surrendered lands and any other lands that are set apart for the use and benefit of a band and that are subject to the ''Indian Act''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/Search/Search.aspx?txtS3archA11=first+nations&amp;txtT1tl3=%22Canadian+Environmental+Protection+Act%2c+1999%22&amp;h1ts0n1y=0&amp;ddC0nt3ntTyp3=Acts CEPA 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; Under sections 46–50 of the CEPA, Environment Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) was initiated. NPRI is the inventory of "pollutants released, disposed of and sent for recycling by facilities across the country".{{sfn|Colihan|2008}} The NPRI is used by First Nation administrations on reserves, along with other research tools, to monitor pollution. For example, NPRI data from Environment Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) showed the [[Aamjiwnaang First Nation]] in Sarnia, Ontario, was "ground zero for Ontario's heaviest load of air pollution."{{sfn|Colihan|2008}}

== Water quality ==
By December 21, 2017, there were 67 long-term boil-water advisories that had been in effect for longer than a year.&lt;ref name="CTV_Aiello"/&gt; These are "public water systems managed by the federal government".&lt;ref name="CTV_Aiello"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/can-pm-trudeau-keep-drinkable-water-promise-to-first-nations-1.3736954 |title=Can PM Trudeau keep drinkable water promise to First Nations? |first=Rachel |last=Aiello |work=CTV News |date=December 28, 2017 |access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also 18 communities that had "water issues for between two and 12 months."&lt;ref name="CTV_Aiello"/&gt;

According to statistics gathered by [[Health Canada]] and the [[First Nations Health Authority]], in 2015, there were "162 drinking water advisories in 118 First Nation communities".&lt;ref name="canadians_water_crisis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://canadians.org/media/federal-party-leaders-urged-end-drinking-water-crisis-first-nation-communities-once-and-all |title=Federal party leaders urged to end drinking water crisis in First Nation communities once and for all |series=Media Release |date=October 13, 2015 |access-date=February 2, 2018 |work=[[Council of Canadians]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, [[Neskantaga First Nation]] reported that its "20-year boil-water advisory" was "the longest running drinking water advisory in Canada."&lt;ref name="canadians_water_crisis"/&gt; [[Shoal Lake 40 First Nation]] was under an 18-year boil water advisory.&lt;ref name="canadians_water_crisis"/&gt; 


By 2006,{{sfn|CBC|2006}} nearly 100 Indian reserves had boil-water advisories and many others had substandard water. [[Kwikwasut'inuxw Haxwa'mis First Nation]], on an island off the British Columbia coast, had a boil-water advisory beginning in 1997.{{sfn|CBC|2006}} In October 2005, "high ''[[E. coli]]'' levels were found in the [[Kashechewan First Nation]] reserve's drinking water and chlorine levels had to be increased to 'shock' levels, causing skin problems and eventually resulting in an evacuation of hundreds of people from the reserve and costing approximately $16 million."{{sfn|CBC|2006}}

[[File:Johannes Schoner Astronomer 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Joan Schonerus Mathematicus]]

'''Johannes Schöner''' (16 January 1477 in [[Karlstadt am Main]] &amp;ndash; 16 January 1547 in [[Nürnberg]]) (aka, Johann Schönner, Johann Schoener, Jean Schönner, Joan Schoenerus) was a renowned and respected [[Germany|German]] [[polymath]]. It is best to refer to him using the usual 16th-century Latin term "mathematicus", as the areas of study to which he devoted his life were very different from those now considered to be the domain of the mathematician. He was a [[priest]], [[astronomer]], [[astrologer]], [[geographer]], [[cosmographer]], [[cartographer]], [[mathematician]], [[globe]] and [[scientific instrument]] maker and editor and publisher of scientific tests. In his own time he enjoyed a European wide reputation as an innovative and influential globe maker and cosmographer and as one of the continent's leading and most authoritative astrologers.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Holst, ''Mundus, Mirabilia, Mentalität: Weltbild und Quellen des Kartographen Johannes Schöner: eine Spurensuche,'' Frankfurt/Oder, Scripvaz, 1999. {{ISBN|3-931278-10-7}}; John W. Hessler , ''A Renaissance Globemaker's Toolbox: Johannes Schöner and the Revolution of Modern Science, 1475-1550,'' Washington, DC: Library of Congress; London: In association with D. Giles Ltd., 2013. {{ISBN|9781907804168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today he is remembered as an influential pioneer in the history of globe making and as a man who played a significant role in the events that led up to the publishing of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus']] "[[De revolutionibus]]" in [[Nürnberg]] in 1543.

==Life==

===Early life===

Schöner was born on 16 January 1477 in [[Karlstadt am Main]] in [[Lower Franconia]]. As with most Renaissance scholars nothing is known about his parents or his early life. All that is known is that he had a brother, Peter, to whom he addressed his "Arzneibuch" in 1528. Quite detailed information for Schöner’s adult life, at least up to 1506, has been preserved in his own marginalia in his copy of [[Regiomontanus]]' printed [[Ephemerides]], which he used as a diary. He matriculated at the [[University of Erfurt]] in the winter semester 1494/5 and graduated Baccalaureus on 21 March 1498. He was appointed to a position in the school in [[Gemünden am Main|Gemünden]] on 22 February 1499 and ordained as a Catholic priest in the [[Bishopric of Bamberg]] on 13 June 1500. On 2 February 1500 he moved to [[Bamberg]] and was appointed chaplain in [[Hallstatt]] near Bamberg on 18 April 1500. His next appointment was as vicar in his hometown Karlstadt from 4 June 1504. Between 4 May and 29 October 1506 he was again in Bamberg before he returned to Karlstadt. His diary also informs us that he entered a relationship with Kunigunde Holocher in 1499, with whom he had three children: a son Johannes born on 1 February 1502, a daughter Sibilla born on 12 June 1503 and a second son Vitus born on 21 November 1504.

[[File:LoC Treasures Gallery Waldseemüller map display 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|A facsimile copy of Schöner's Waldseemüller map at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington]]
Schöner was the owner of the only specimen of the 1507 [[Waldseemüller map]] of the world that has survived and which was rediscovered at [[Schloss Wolfegg]] in [[Upper Swabia]] in 1901. Since 2003 it is in possession of the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="LibCon"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2003/03-110.html|title=News from the Library of Congress: Library of Congress Completes Purchase of Waldseemüller Map|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=18 June 2003 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bamberg===
[[Image:Schöner - Algorithmus demonstratus, 1534 - 144343.jpg|thumb|''Algorithmus demonstratus'', 1534]]

No diary exists after 1506, and up to 1515 there are only indirect traces of Schöner's existence in the financial records of the bishopric and in the correspondence of Lorenz Beheim (?1457 - 1521), who after 24 years in Rome as chamberlain to Pope Alexander IV had returned to Bamberg in 1505 as a canon of the cathedral.

1526, he was called to Nürnberg as the first professor of mathematics at the newly founded gymnasium ''Aegidianum'', a post he held till one year prior to his death. At the same time, he converted to Protestantism and married.

Already in Bamberg, he owned his own printing company and published many [[map]]s and [[globe]]s. The very first printed globe of the sky was made in his workshop in 1515. He made another [[globe]] in 1520.[[File:Schöner globe 1520 western hemisphere.jpg|thumb|Western hemisphere of the Schöner globe from 1520.]]

Schöner had also made still unpublished data of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] observations from Walther available to Copernicus, 45 observations in total, 14 of them with longitude and latitude. Copernicus used three of them in "[[De revolutionibus]]", giving only longitudes, and falsely attributing them to Schöner. The values differed slightly from the ones published by Schöner in 1544.

1538, [[Georg Joachim Rheticus]], a young professor of mathematics at [[Wittenberg]] and former assistant of Copernicus, stayed for some time with Schöner who convinced him to visit [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in [[Frombork|Frauenburg]]. In 1540, Rheticus dedicated the first published report of Copernicus work, the ''[[Narratio prima]]'', to Schöner, to test the waters of the reaction by the [[Catholic Church]]. As this was well received, Copernicus finally agreed to publish his main work, and Rheticus prepared Copernicus' manuscript for printing.

In Nürnberg, Schöner published in 1544 the astronomical observations of [[Regiomontanus]] and Walther, as well as manuscripts of Regiomontanus, which had been in the hand of Walther, as ''Observationes XXX annorum a I. Regiomontano et B. Walthero Norimbergae habitae, [4°, Norimb. 1544].''

A [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mars]] is named in his honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6266">{{Latin place names}}
This list includes [[Africa]]n [[countries]] and [[regions]] 
that were part of the [[Roman Empire]], 
or that were given [[Latin]] place names in [[historical]] [[Reference work|references]].

==Background==
[[Image:Africae romanae Urbes.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Roman places in Africa]]
Until the [[Modern Era]], [[Latin]] was the [[Lingua franca|common language]] for [[scholarship]] and [[Cartography|mapmaking]]. During the 19th and 20th centuries, [[Germany|German]] scholars in particular have made significant contributions to the study of historical place names, or ''Ortsnamenkunde''. These studies have, in turn, contributed to the study of [[genealogy]]. For genealogists and historians of pre-Modern Europe, knowing alternate names of places is vital to extracting information from both public and private records. Even specialists in this field point out, however, that the information can be easily taken out of context, since there is a great deal of repetition of place names throughout Europe; reliance purely on apparent connections should therefore be tempered with valid historical methodology.

==Caveats and notes==
Latin place names are not always exclusive to one place &amp;mdash; for example, there were several Roman cities whose names began with ''Colonia'' and then a more descriptive term. During the [[Middle Ages]], these were often shortened to just ''Colonia''. One of these, ''Colonia Agrippinensis'', retains the name today in the form of [[Cologne]].

Early sources for [[ancient Rome|Roman]] names show numerous variants and spellings of the [[Latin]] names.

The modern canonical name is listed first. 
Sources are listed chronologically. 
In general, only the earliest source is shown for each name, 
although many of the names are recorded in more than one of the sources. 
Where the source differs in spelling, 
or has other alternatives, 
these are listed following the source. 
As an aid to searching, 
variants are spelled completely, 
and listed in most likely chronology.

Superscripts indicate:
# Latinized form of the Greek-derived name.
# Latinized form of the Asian-derived name via Greek.
# Altered Latinized form of the Greek-derived name.

Grässe]], ''[[Orbis Latinus|Orbis Latinus: Lexikon lateinischer geographischer Namen des Mittelalters und der Neuzeit]]'' (1861), an exhaustive work of meticulous German scholarship that is available online in the second edition of 1909. To use it, one must understand German names of countries, as they were in 1909. The original was re-edited and expanded in a multivolume edition in 1972.

This is a '''list of [[President of Ethiopia|Presidents]] of [[Ethiopia]]''' and also a list of '''heads of state''' after the fall of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] in 1974. 

Until 1974, the heads of state of the Ethiopian Empire were either [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperors]] or regents. From the [[coup d'état]] of the [[Derg]] leading to the fall of the Empire in September 1974 until March 1975, the Derg considered the Crown Prince [[Asfaw Wossen]] as the nominal ''head of state'' – which the Crown Prince refused to accept. During this time, the ''Chairmen of the Derg'', the leaders of the Derg, were to be considered as ''acting heads of state''. After 21 March 1975, the ''Derg military junta'' fully took over. Until the establishment of the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] in 1987, still dominated by Derg figures, Chairmen of the Derg have to be considered ''heads of state'' – but not ''presidents''. After the fall of the Derg and the establishment of the [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia]] in 1991, the first immediate President ([[Meles Zenawi]]) has to be considered an ''Interim President''.

Since the formal establishment of the office of President in 1987, there have been 6 official presidents. The President is the [[head of state]] of Ethiopia. The current president is [[Sahle-Work Zewde]], who is also the first female president of Ethiopia, [[Ethiopian presidential election, 2018|elected]] on 25 October 2018 by members of the [[Federal Parliamentary Assembly]].

==List==
In the list, the ''Chairmen of the Derg'' are considered to be ''heads of state'' – but are not considered to be President. Consequently, the numbering starts with the first establishment of the office of the ''President of Ethiopia'' in 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72520">The list of Prince Edward Island by-elections includes every by-election held in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island since 1873. By-elections occur whenever there is a vacancy in the [[Prince Edward Island Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], although an imminent general election may allow the vacancy to remain until the dissolution of parliament. Until 1932 incumbent members were required to recontest their seats upon being appointed to Cabinet. These Ministerial by-elections were almost always uncontested.

{{legend|#47828f|States with no military forces}}

]]

This is a '''list of countries without armed forces'''. The term ''country'' here means [[sovereign state]]s and not [[List of dependent territories|dependencies]] (e.g., [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Bermuda]]), whose defense is the responsibility of another country or an army alternative. The term ''[[armed forces]]'' refers to any government-sponsored defense used to further the [[Domestic policy|domestic]] and [[Foreign policy|foreign]] policies of their respective government. Some of the countries listed, such as [[Iceland]] and [[Monaco]], have no [[standing armies]] but still have a non-police military force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.is/foreign-policy/security/the-defence-act/ |title=The Defence Act &amp;#124; Defence and Security Affairs &amp;#124; Subjects &amp;#124; Ministry for Foreign Affairs |publisher=Mfa.is |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.mc/Gouvernement-et-Institutions/Le-Gouvernement/Departement-de-l-Interieur/Direction-de-la-Surete-Publique |title=Direction de la Sûreté Publique / Département de l'Intérieur / Le Gouvernement / Gouvernement et Institutions / Portail du Gouvernement - Monaco |language=fr |publisher=Gouv.mc |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/europe/monaco.html |title=Comparative Criminology &amp;#124; Europe - Monaco |publisher=Rohan.sdsu.edu |date=2002-01-01 |accessdate=2012-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430001200/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/europe/monaco.html |archivedate=2012-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Many of the twenty-one countries listed here typically have had a long-standing agreement with a former [[Military occupation|occupying country]]; one example is the agreement between [[Monaco]] and [[France]], which has [[History of Monaco|existed for at least 300 years]].&lt;ref name="monaco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mn.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Compact of Free Association]] nations of the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FSM), and [[Palau]] rely on the United States for their defense.  They ensure their national security concerns are addressed through annual Joint Committee Meetings to discuss defense matters with [[United States Indo-Pacific Command|US Pacific Command]].  [[Andorra]] has a [[Military of Andorra|small army]], and can request defensive aid if necessary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=1993/16868 |title=Documento BOE-A-1993-16868 |publisher=BOE.es |date=1993-06-30 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="andorra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/wfb1990/andorra/andorra_military.html|title=Andorra Defense Forces - 1990|accessdate=2008-02-27|year=1990|publisher=CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Iceland]] had a [[Iceland Defense Force|unique agreement]] with the [[United States]] that lasted until 2006, which required them to provide defense to Iceland when needed.&lt;ref name="iceland"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/assignments/a/iceland.htm |title=U.S. Military Forces Leaving Iceland |publisher=Usmilitary.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining countries are responsible for their own defense, and operate either without any armed forces, or with limited armed forces. Some of the countries, such as [[Costa Rica]] and [[Grenada]], underwent a process of [[demilitarization]].&lt;ref name="rss"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-02-27|url=https://www.state.gov/p/wha/rls/70686.htm|title=Treaty Establishing the Regional Security System (1996) |publisher=United States Department of State }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-17/news/mn-183_1_palace-guard |title=Breakup of Palace Guard Helps to Demilitarize Haiti - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1990-03-17 |accessdate=2012-06-17 |first=Don A. |last=Schanche}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="costa rica"/&gt; Other countries were formed without armed forces, such as [[History of Samoa|Samoa over {{round|{{age|format=raw|1962|1|1}}|-1}} years ago]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-countries-without-military-forces.php |title=Top 10 Countries Without Military Forces &amp;#124; Top 10 Lists |publisher=TopTenz.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the primary reason being that they were, or still are, under protection from another nation at their point of independence. All of the countries on this list are considered to be in a situation of "non-militarization."&lt;ref name="non-military"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-02-27 |url=http://www.demilitarisation.org/Countrieswithoutarmy.htm |title=Non-militarization |publisher=Demilitarization |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225042431/http://www.demilitarisation.org/Countrieswithoutarmy.htm |archivedate=December 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Haiti]] abolished its army in 1994, after a US [[Operation Uphold Democracy|invasion]] deposed the military junta which had ruled the country since 1992. In 2017, after the end of the [[MINUSTAH]], the Haitian government announced the restoration of the [[Haitian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-haiti-military/haitian-army-set-to-make-controversial-return-after-two-decades-idUSKBN1DJ01M|title=Haitian army set to make controversial return after two decades|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-revived-military/4117695.html|title=Haiti Hasn't Had a Military in Years — It Does Now|first=Yvan Martin|last=Jasmin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==
Upon liberation of Greece in '''1830''', the extreme points of the country were:

*North: [[Psathoura]] island (39.498°N 24.181°E) in the Northern [[Sporades]], NE of [[Alonnisos]]
*South: [[Eschati]] (Mermengas) islet in the Cyclades, around 10 miles SW of [[Santorini]]
*East: [[Amorgos]] island (36°50′N 25°54′E) and in particular the eastern tip thereof, east of Aegiali village
*West: [[Forti]] islet in the Ionian Sea, in the narrow straits between the island of [[Lefkas]] (still under British rule) and the coast of [[Acarnania]] province of the [[Aetolia-Acarnania]] prefecture, to which it belonged

Upon granting of the Ionian Islands to Greece in '''1864''' the extreme points of the country were modified as follows:

*North &amp; West: [[Sazan Island]] (''Sason, Saso'') (40°30′N 19°17′E) at the entrance of the [[Bay of Vlorë]] (''Aulon, Avlona'')
*South: [[Antikythera]] (35°52′N 23°18′E)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1902">'''Slovak Post''' (Slovenská pošta) in 2006 offered a service for the lookup of [[postal code]]s (poštové smerové číslo PSČ) in [[Slovakia]]. The service works in both [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[English language|English]]. The Post offers the ability to search postal codes of towns and streets (see the list below of towns where a street code is needed) or to search by town and company name. Furthermore, the list of postcodes is available as a [[ZIP file]].

==Usage==


Postal codes need to be written '''before''' the name of the town, and no shortening of the official state name (e.g. 'SK') is permitted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12370">A '''little Switzerland''' or '''''Schweiz''''' is a [[landscape]], often of wooded hills. This [[Romanticism|Romantic]] aesthetic term is not a geographic category, but was widely used in the 19th century to connote dramatic natural scenic features that would be of interest to tourists. Since it was ambiguous from the very beginning, it was flexibly used in travel writing to imply that a landscape had some features, though on a much smaller scale, that might remind a visitor of [[Switzerland]].

== Rock outcrops ==
[[Image:Bastei - Die Bastei vom Elbe-Aussichtspunkt.jpg|thumb|The [[Bastei]], [[Saxon Switzerland]]]]
[[Image:Rochedoetre.jpg|thumb|[[Rock of Oëtre]], [[Norman Switzerland]]]]

The original generic term was applied to dozens of locations in Europe, the bulk of them German-speaking, as well as to other parts of the world, to direct attention to rock outcrops that stand out, usually amid steep forest. The original, 18th-century comparison was usually with the fissured crags of the [[Jura Mountains]] on the Franco-Swiss border which hardly rise higher than 1700 metres. 

Histories of [[Saxon Switzerland]] (''Sächsische Schweiz'') in Saxony, Germany, assert that the landscape description ''schweiz'' arose there at the end of the 18th century. ''Schweiz'' is the German-language name of Switzerland. The term was used both alone and with the prefix "little", for example in the title of an 1820 German book-length poem, ''Die kleine Schweiz'' by Jakob Reiselsberger,&lt;ref&gt;Reiselsberger, Jakob; Die kleine Schweiz oder Einladung zur Reise nach Streitberg, Muggendorf, Weischenfeld [et]c. und deren Umgebungen; Leitfaden für hieher Reisende, Höhlen-Besucher, Natur- und Alterthums-Freunde, und schön unterhaltendes Taschenbuch für jedermann; [S.l.] 1820&lt;/ref&gt; which praised the rocky scenery of a part of [[Franconia]] in Germany known thereafter as the [[Franconian Switzerland]] (''Fränkische Schweiz'').

The term was already colloquial by this time in English: in 1823 a correspondent asserted in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' that a steep area by the road outside [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]] in southern England was a little Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's Magazine'', London; December 1823, page 506&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic term, to describe picturesque exposed rock and steepness rather than altitude, was also in common use in other European languages, including the French term ''Suisse''. Rocks and wild landscapes were a favoured theme in [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painting.

The many English places praised in 19th-century promotional literature as "little Switzerland" include [[Church Stretton]], [[Whitfield, Northumberland|Whitfield]] and the coastal area around the [[North Devon]] twin towns of Lynton and [[Lynmouth]]. Chalet-style buildings were sometimes erected to emphasize little Switzerland pretensions, for example at [[Matlock Bath railway station|Matlock Bath]], which (unusually for England) also features a [[Aerial lift|cable car]].

== Mountains ==

From the beginning, the term was often understood as a comparison to the snow-capped Alps rather than to the Jura. The following passage, describing Wales, appears in an 1831 English-language edition of [[Conrad Malte-Brun|Malte-Brun's]] ''Universal Geography'', which had originally been written in French in 1803–07: 

{{cquote|The great number of mountains which diversify its surface have gained it the name of Little Switzerland. It will be readily understood that it is not in the loftiness of their summits this resemblance can be traced with the country of the Alps, but in their steep, rough and perpendicular sides, the depth of their narrow valleys, the small but limpid lakes which occur at every step, the great number of rivers and streams which are now precipitated in cascades, and now roll their waters slowly through the meadows, the damp fogs which rise from the surface of these waters and often hang about the summits of the highest mountains, and the snow which frequently continues upon the heights till the end of spring: all of which give to these mountains, notwithstanding their inconsiderable height ... an appearance resembling those lordly eminences mounting up to the clouds and bearing on their heads eternal snows.&lt;ref&gt;Malte-Brun, Conrad; Universal Geography: Or, a Description of All Parts of the World, on a New Plan; Boston, Lilly and Wait, 1831, volume 1, page 742&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Describing the Atlantic island of St Helena in ''A New Voyage Round the World'' (1823–26), [[Otto von Kotzebue]] and [[Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz]] were translated into English as writing: 

{{cquote|The environs of Sandy Bay would be a perfect little Switzerland, but that the glaciers are wanting to complete the resemblance. Scattered among the enormous masses of rock which lie confusedly heaped upon each other a frightful wilderness and most smilingly picturesque landscape alternately present their contrasted images.&lt;ref&gt;Kotzebue, Otto von and Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz; A New Voyage Round the World in the Years 1823, 24, 25, and 26; Colburn and Bentley, 1830, page 317&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States, the raw [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of New Hampshire, which were soon to be one of the definitive subjects of American Romantic [[White Mountain art|painting]], were termed a little Switzerland by travel writer Henry Tudor as early as 1832.&lt;ref&gt;Tudor, Henry; Narrative of a Tour in North America; London, James Duncan, 1834, page 390&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lakelands ==
[[Image:Plön Panorama Ploener See.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Plön]] in [[Holstein Switzerland]]]]

In the later 19th century, authors and tourism promoters would praise picture-postcard summer scenery of woods and low hills reflected in blue lakes as a little Switzerland or ''schweiz''. Whereas the earlier use had implied a landscape of dangers, this was a term for beauty. 

This usage, reflected today in the official geographical terms for the [[Holstein Switzerland]] (''Holsteinische Schweiz'') and [[Mecklenburgische Schweiz|Mecklenburg Switzerland]] (''Mecklenburgische Schweiz'') in Germany, where there are neither mountains nor outcrops, is difficult to account for, but may refer to prestigious Swiss lakeside tourist destinations such as Zurich, Lucerne or [[Interlaken]] or to Lakes Geneva and Constance.

== Official names ==

The term has often appeared anachronistic since travel to Switzerland became affordable. By the 21st century, it was common for observers to express puzzlement that the "little Switzerland" label applied at all to regions such as the Suisse Normande, or to the Holstein Switzerland where the flat hilltops are no more than 150 metres above the lake surfaces.

In 1992, the Swiss Tourism Federation counted&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraenkische-schweiz.com/info/hintergrund/name_fs_entstehung.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019142004/http://www.fraenkische-schweiz.com/info/hintergrund/name_fs_entstehung.htm |date=October 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 190 places round the world that had at least for some period been named after Switzerland, either because of a fancied scenic resemblance, in jest or referring to a banking haven, political neutrality or habitation by Swiss emigrants. No fewer than 67 places in neighbouring Germany were said by the Federation to have adopted little Switzerland names. 

While the byname has fallen out of fashion in some places, it persists as the official geographical name for several administrative regions and national parks including (with dates of legal designation):
* [[Bohemian Switzerland]] (''České Švýcarsko'', nature park, Czech Republic, legislation with effect 2000)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceskesvycarsko.cz/bohemian-switzerland-national-park&lt;/ref&gt;

Business promotion regions using the name without legally defined boundaries include:
* [[Norman Switzerland|Suisse Normande]] (upland region of [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], France)
* [[Little Switzerland (Luxembourg)]] (dolomite formations near [[Echternach, Luxembourg]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berdorf.lu/ |title=berdorf.lu |publisher=berdorf.lu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable privately developed properties known by the name include:
* [[Little Switzerland, North Carolina]] (resort development on hilltop in North Carolina, USA, from 1909)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/501546.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311175358/http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/501546.html |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Little Switzerland (Wisconsin)]] (a ski resort from 1941 onwards)

== Usage ==
In English, "Little Switzerland" is usually said without any definite article or additional adjective, but often with a genitive modifier if there are several little Switzerlands within one nation, e.g. North Carolina's Little Switzerland. In European languages where Switzerland proper takes a definite article, little Switzerlands do likewise. Their English names may echo the vernacular, being capitalized and modified to the English alphabet, sometimes taking an English definite article, e.g. the Saechsische Schweiz (''die Sächsische Schweiz'') and the Suisse Normande (''la Suisse normande''). English forms are also widespread, e.g. Holstein Switzerland (Dickinson, 1964),&lt;ref&gt;{{Dickinson's Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss Franconia (Michelin, 1993),&lt;ref&gt;''Germany, Michelin Tourist Guide'', 1st Edition, 1993, Clermont-Ferrand, p 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Franconian Switzerland (Fodor, 1962,&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Eugene; ''Fodor's Modern Guides: Germany'', MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1962, The Hague, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bolt, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Bolt, Rodney, ''Bavaria'', London, 2005, pp. 203-204, {{ISBN|1-86011-202-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Naraka''' ({{lang-sa|नरक}}, literally ''of man'') is the [[Sanskrit]] word for the realm of [[hell]] in [[Dharmic Tradition|Dharmic traditions]]. According to some schools of [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], Naraka is a place of torment. The word 'Neraka' (modification of Naraka) in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] has also been used to describe the [[Jahannam|Islamic concept of Hell]].

Alternatively, the "hellish beings" that are said to reside in this underworld are often referred to as "Narakas". These beings are also termed in [[Hindi]] as '''Narakis''' ({{lang-sa|नारकीय}}, ''{{transl|sa|Nārakī}}''), '''Narakarnavas''' ({{lang-sa|नरकार्णव}}, ''{{transl|sa|Narakārṇava}}'') and '''Narakavasis''' ({{lang-sa|नरकवासी}}, ''{{transl|sa|Narakavāsī}}'').

==Hinduism==

[[File:Hindu hell.jpg|thumb|A large central panel portrays Yama the god of death (often referred to as Dharma) seated on a throne; to the left stands a demon. To the right of Yama sits Chitragupta, assigned with keeping detailed records of every human being and upon their death deciding how they are to be reincarnated, depending on their previous actions.]]

''Naraka'' in [[Vedas]], is a place where souls are sent for the expiation of their sins. It is mentioned especially in [[dharmaśāstra]]s, [[itihāsa]]s and {{IAST|[[Purāṇa]]}}s but also in [[Vedas|Vedic samhitas]],&lt;ref&gt;Śukla Yajur Veda 30.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atharva Veda 12.4.36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aranyaka]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Aitareya Āraṇyaka}} 2.3.2.4,5&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IAST|[[Upaniṣad]]s}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Mahanārāyaṇa Upaniṣad}} 1.50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Praśna Upaniṣad}} 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Nirālamba Upaniṣad}} 2, 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Paramahaṃsa Upaniṣad}} 3&lt;/ref&gt; Some Upanisads speak of 'darkness' instead of hell.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|asuryā nāma te lokā andhena tamasāvṛtāḥ}}'' - {{IAST|Īśa Upaniṣad}} 3&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of {{IAST|Upaniṣads}}, [[Bhagavad Gita]], mentions hell several times.&lt;ref&gt;1.41, 1.43, 16.16, 16.21&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Adi Sankara]] mentions it in his commentary on [[Brahma Sutras|Vedanta sutra]].&lt;ref&gt;Vedānta sūtra 4.3.14&lt;/ref&gt;
Still, some people like members of [[Arya Samaj]] don't accept the existence of Naraka or consider it metaphorical.

In Puranas like [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Garuda Purana]] and [[Vishnu Purana]] there are elaborate descriptions of many hells. They are situated above the Garbhodaka ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Bhāgavata Purāṇa}} 5.26.5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], Lord of Justice, judges living beings after [[death]] and assigns appropriate punishments. [[Nitya-samsarins]] (forever transmigrating ones) can experience Naraka for [[expiation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'', by Swami Tapasyananda&lt;/ref&gt; After the period of punishment is complete, they are reborn on earth&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Bhāgavata Purāṇa}} 5.26.37&lt;/ref&gt; in human or animal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Garuḍa Purāṇa}} 2.10.88-89, 2.46.9-10,28&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, neither naraka nor [[svarga]]&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad gītā 9.21&lt;/ref&gt; are permanent abodes.

''Yama Loka'' is the abode of Lord Yama. Yama is ''Dharmaraja'' or Dharma king; Yama Loka is a temporary ''purgatorium'' for sinners (papi). According to Hindu scriptures, Yama's divine assistant Lord [[Chitragupta]] maintains a record of the individual deeds of every living being in the world, and based on the complete audit of his deeds, dispatches the soul of the deceased either to [[Svarga]] (Heaven) or to the various Narakas according to the nature of their sins. The scriptures describe that even people who have done a majority of good deeds could come to Yama Loka for redemption from the small sins they have committed, and once the punishments have been served for those sins they could be sent for rebirth to earth or to heaven. In the epic of [[Mahabharata]], even the [[Pandavas]] (who represent righteousness and virtuousness) spent a brief time in hell for their small sins.

At the time of death, [[sin]]ful souls are vulnerable for capture by Yamadutas, servants of Yama (who comes personally only in special cases). Yama ordered his servants to leave [[Vaishnava]]s alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Bhāgavata Purāṇa}} 6.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Nṛsiṃha Purāṇa}} 9.1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Vaishnavas are taken by Vishnudutas to [[Vaikuntha]] and Gaudiya Vaishnavas to [[Goloka]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Naraka (Buddhism)}}
[[File:Buddhist-hell-Thailand-3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A mural from a temple in northern Thailand. The unclothed spirits of the dead are brought before [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]] for judgement. In the background, Mālaya (พระมาลัย) watches from above as sinners are fried in a large oil cauldron.]]

In Buddhism, Naraka refers to the worlds of greatest suffering. [[Buddhist texts]] describe a vast array of tortures and realms of torment in Naraka; an example is the ''Devadūta-sutta'' from the [[Pāli Canon]]. The descriptions vary from text to text and are not always consistent with each other. Though the term is often translated as "hell", unlike the Abrahamic hells, Naraka is not eternal, though when a timescale is given, it is suggested to be extraordinarily long. In this sense, it is similar to [[purgatory]], but unlike both Abrahamic hell and purgatory, there is no [[divine]] force involved in determining a being's entry and exit to and from the realm and no [[soul]] is involved. Rather, the being is brought here—as is the case with all the other realms in the [[Buddhist cosmology]]—by natural law: the law of [[Karma (Buddhism)|karma]], and they remain until the negative karma that brought them there has been used up.

==Jainism==
{{Main|Naraka (Jainism)}}
In Jainism, Naraka is the name given to realm of existence in [[Jain cosmology]] having great suffering. The length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long—measured in billions of years.  A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened. Jain texts mention that these hells are situated in the seven grounds at the lower part of the universe. The seven grounds are:

# Ratna prabha
# Sharkara prabha.
# Valuka prabha.
# Panka prabha.
# Dhuma prabha.
# Tamaha prabha.
# Mahatamaha prabha.

The '''Palmachim Airbase''' ({{lang-he|{{Hebrew|בָּסִיס חֵיל-הַאֲוִויר פַּלְמַחִים}}}}) is an [[Israel]]i military facility and [[spaceport]] located near the cities of [[Rishon LeZion]] and [[Yavne]] on the [[Mediterranean]] coast. It is named after nearby [[Kibbutz]] [[Palmachim]].

The base is home to several IAF [[helicopter]] and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] squadrons, and serves as a [[rocket launch site]] for the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070326-mda01.htm| title=U.S./Israel Complete Successful Arrow Missile Defense Test| publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmachim is also used to launch the [[Shavit]] [[Outer space|space]] [[launch vehicle]] into [[retrograde orbit]] by launching over the Mediterranean, acting as Israel's primary spaceport. The launchpad is situated at {{coord|31|53|04|N|34|40|49|E|type:landmark|name=Shavit launchpad}} This ensures that rocket debris falls into water, and that the rocket does not fire over regional neighboring countries near Israel that could use the technology. Palmachim is also used to test ballistic missiles, such as the [[Jericho (missile)|Jericho]].

Recent launches include:
* 11 June 2007 - [[Ofek-7|Ofeq 7]] satellite&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Israel_Launches_New_Spy_Satellite_999.html Israel Launches New Spy Satellite], www.spacewar.com, accessed 12 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, it was agreed that once [[Sde Dov Airport]] in [[Tel Aviv]] was closed, its military terminal would be transferred to Palmachim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3420369,00.html | title=Tel Aviv airport to make way for luxury project | accessdate=2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
although [[Sde Dov Airport]] continues to operate.

==Units==
The current units at Palmachim include:
* [[123 Squadron (Israel)|123 Squadron]] – operating [[UH-60 Black Hawk]]
* [[124 Squadron (Israel)|124th Squadron]] – operating [[Sikorsky S-70]], [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk]]

'''Rafael Torres Campos''' (1853–1904) was one of the most important Spanish [[Geography|geographers]] at the end of the nineteenth century. His work in Spanish geography was particularly relevant because it introduced modern currents of European and American geography into Spain. His dedication to teaching led to the creation of a sophisticated group of geographical educators whose influence, although difficult to measure, has extended to the present. Because of his close links with people and institutions of a progressive character his work has been completely neglected: these pages are dedicated to a late but necessary recuperation of his reputation.

== Education, life and work ==
Torres Campos was born in 1853 in Almeria in southern Spain, where he completed his primary and secondary education. At the age of sixteen, when he had completed these studies, he moved to Madrid, following in the footsteps of his older brother to read Law at the Central University. This first stay in the capital was to profoundly affect his life and later work. This was a time of intense social and political agitation and cultural developments. He arrived in Madrid in 1868, the very year of the September revolutions which precipitated the setting up of the first Spanish republic. He thus became fully aware of the problems that affected his country.

At the same time, his studies at the university brought him into contact with the philosophy of the Krausists, which, having entered the Spanish scientific panorama in the previous decades, was at this time was having a deep influence on young Spanish students. This philosophy, which represented a complete break with the prevailing Scholastic tradition, was the key to later Spanish Liberalism. The philosophy was to aim at a social and ethical reform in its search for the 'human ideal' with special reference to the possibility of a new and revolutionary pedagogy along the lines of Rousseau, Pestalozzi and Fröebel, using as a background a 'harmonic rationalism' of idealist origin. Its basic tenets, once freed from their initial dogmatism and imbued with the methods of the new Positivism, were taken up and never abandoned by Torres Campos.

Especially important{{According to whom|date=December 2017}} to an understanding of his work is the friendship of Torres Campos during these years with a number of the teachers in the Law Faculty, foremost inheritors of the philosophical system described above, which came increasingly to colour his subsequent aspirations and activities. Such was the case with Fernando de Castro, rector of the [[Central University of Madrid]] and instigator of the education of women in Spain; likewise with [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]] who, having been dismissed from his chair of Law in 1875 because his opposition to the government's education policies, founded, as a way to preserve the freedom of science, an Institute of Free Education, of which Torres Campos became a member and into which he channeled a part of his teaching activity.

The manifold threats to the republican régime at this time necessitated obligatory military service, which forced Torres Campos to leave the university in 1873, by which time he was assistant lecturer to the chair of Public Deeds and Judicial Proceedings. He willingly accepted this imposition, given his deep republican convictions evidenced during this period, and did so by sitting the entrance examination for the recently created 'Military Administration Corps,' a competition held among young academics and in which Torres Campos came first. It was here that, after a very short training period, he first came into contact with geography, a fact which he was to record years later in the prologue to one of his books; ''Estudios Geográficos'' [Geographical Studies]

"Appointed as a teacher in the School of Military Administration towards the beginning of my career, I was hoping, given my recently completed legal studies, to be given a class in Law. The assignment of the Teachers' Committee brought me to Geography, and in preparation for this rôle I turned to his book Geografía Histórico-Militar de España [Historico-Military Geography of Spain] (referring to a work by José Gómez de Arteche).
The excellence of this work, the pure and sober way in which the author describes the accidents and peculiarities of our country, the well-considered account given of the influence of surroundings on human acts, the depth and originality of his historico-military observations, fired my imagination and lead me to make geography, as understood in this book, my chosen field." (Torres, 1895, p.&amp;nbsp;III)

During 1876 whilst Torres Campos was staying in Avila both the Sociedad Geográfica de Madrid [Madrid Geographical Society] and the [[Institución Libre de Enseñanza]] (The Institute of Free Teaching) were founded. He was to become a member of both societies during the following year. The former gave him contact with the most significant contemporary geographers of Spain, men such as Coello, Ibañez, Fernández Duro, Valle, ... whilst the latter involved him in a new closer relationship with the Liberal thinkers.
Like the aforementioned Giner de los Ríos, these Liberals had abandoned the universities, of their own volition or compelled to do so because of their support for the incipient movement to obtain a new, rigorous and undogmatic educational system in Spain.
He began his activities in the Institute of Free Teaching preparing a Doctorate in Law and reading the preparatory courses for Medicine. He divided his time between this and his role as secretary of the Institute.

His new post, allied with his willingness to travel and good-natured character led him to represent the Institute at The Universal Exhibition of Science, Arts and Letters, held in Paris during the summer of 1878. Whilst there he attended seminars given by the geographer Emile Levasseur on the geography teaching methodology that he had been developing in France during the Third Republic. Torres Campos' interest in the culturally eclectic contents of the Exhibition was clearly demonstrated by the diverse nature of his first articles published in the Boletín de la Institución Libre de Enseñanza [Bulletin of the Institute of Free Education]: “El presupuesto de Instrucción Pública en Francia” [The Budget for Public Instruction in France], and “La porcelana en la Exposición de París” [Porcelain at the Paris Exhibition]....

However, despite his eclecticism, Torres Campos' attention remained focussed on geographical teaching methodology. In parallel with the Institutionalists, Torres Campos was seeking an educational system which would be both personalised and practical, and would incorporate lectures, smaller seminar groups and laboratory work. He returned to Spain with a variety of geological sections, relief models, a geographical clock, and the principles of the savings bank project. In addition, he brought back to Spain the idea of student field excursions soon put into practice by the Institute of Free Teaching, which was to be described in The Times of October 1884 as “using them more than any other European school”. Torres Campos was to dedicate a pamphlet, Viajes Escolares [School Field Trips], to this very subject.

The idea of student field excursions were becoming increasingly important in the formation of the Institute's educational programmes for the possibilities they offered of an 'intuitive' understanding of the objects of physical and human studies. The profound faith of its members in the seemingly enormous educational potential of these methods led them to organise the First National Congress of Pedagology, with the aim of expounding and propagating excursionista educational theories. Torres Campos, in his position as director of field trips, was an active participant in the organisation.

In 1879 he was elected associate secretary of the Madrid Geographical Society. One of his first assignments in this organisation was the editing of the “Reseñas de las tareas y estado de la Sociedad”[Summary of Works and the Current State of Society], a work which argued that geographical studies should be more closely related to the political, social and economic problems of the country, laying special emphasis on colonial questions. His work on this led him to organise in 1883, together with other geographers such as J. Costa and F. Coello, a congress entitled Colonial and Mercantile Geography Congress. This group also founded the Society of Africanists and Colonialists which was to become a year later the Commercial Geography Society. He edited its journal -Revista de Geografía Comercial[Geographical and Commercial Review]-, writing, amongst many other articles, in collaboration with Joaquín Costa, the introductory article of this review, entitled “La Geografía y el Comercio” [Geography and Commerce].

In 1882 he was, partly from economic necessity and perhaps more importantly out of a genuine desire to propagate his pedagogical theories, to sit the civil service examinations for the position of lecturer at the Escuela Normal Central de Maestras [The Central Women's Teacher Training College]. He was at this time being somewhat poorly paid to give classes in commercial geography at the [[Asociación para la Enseñanza de la Mujer]] [Association for Women's Education], an organisation dependent on the Central Women's Teacher Training College. He obtained the lectureship, and along with other lecturers busied himself with pedagogical theory, undertaking the structural and methodological innovations in their teaching. They introduced technical subjects and greater emphasis was placed on the role of geographical knowledge. This is the phase described in the long publication of 1884 as La reforma en la enseñanza de la mujer y la reorganzacion de la Escuela Normal Central de Maestras [The reform of the teaching of women and the reorganization of the Central Women's Teacher Training College].

Meanwhile, the importance of his works for the Geographical Societies were becoming more widely recognised and as a result they were chosen to be presented, in 1889, at the Fourth Paris International Geographical Congress, a congress of a kind which had not been held for years due to Europe's colonial problems, as a result of which even at the 1889 congress few nations were represented. The result being that the conference was over-ridingly French in character, with great emphasis being placed on the most recent trends in French geographical thought, chiefly that of regional geography. Torres Campos was deeply impressed by all he saw and heard, perhaps even more so as one of the principal backers of the congress, [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]], was playing a very active role in its development. From this time Torres Campos became one of the principle Spanish exponents of regional geography, taking full advantage of the means of expression of the Geographical Societies and the Institute of Free Teaching.

He represented Spain at the Berne International Congress of 1891 continuing to be a receptive participant, focussing now on new developments in geography coming from Europe and America, which appear, together with his reports of the Paris proceedings and lengthy articles on colonialism, slavery and emigration, in his book Estudios Geográficos [Geographical Studies] The congress awarded him first prize in its education section for his presentation on the educational achievements and innovations of the Institute of Free Teaching.

Torres Campos also represented Spain at the Fourth International Geographical Congress, held during 1895 in London. This formed the basis of his book “La Geografia en 1895. Memoria sobre el Congreso Internacional de Ciencias Geograficas Celebrado en Londres” [Geography in 1995. An Account of the International Congress of Geographical Sciences held in London], as well as of numerous articles in various Spanish magazines.

He also participated during 1892 in the Second National Congress of Pedagology and the National Congress of Spanish-Portuguese-American Geography. At these he presented papers on women's education and Spanish colonialism respectively, the latter of which he compared in its development with Anglo-Saxon colonialism in California. He was commissioned by the Ministry of War to travel in Italy and Austria-Hungary, where he visited various schools of geography; from these he collected much important information, allowing him to undertake his “Memoria sobre el progreso de los trabajos geográficos” [Notes on the Progress of Geographical Work] which, until his death in 1904, he edited for the Bulletin of the Sociedad Geográfica de Madrid, in his capacity as Secretary general. In it these he presented the latest developments in geographical knowledge and in its diverse specialist fields of vulcanology, seismics, glaciology and oceanology.

Towards the end of his life and after active contribution to the war effort during the Hispano-Cuban conflict of 1898, in charge of the purchase of provisions from France and Germany, he gave geography classes in the Chair created for this purpose in the Scientific and Literary Atheneum of Madrid. In a course of lectures entitled “Los Pueblos de Asia” [The People of Asia] he displayed his wide and scholarly knowledge of history. His life and works fully merited the honour bestowed on him when, in 1901, he was named as a member of the Royal Academy of History.

== Scientific ideas, geographical thought ==
Torres Campos' concept of the world and his geographical thought were markedly shaped and influenced primarily by his contact with Krausist philosophy, and by extension through his close links with the Institute of Free Teaching.

According to the author, in line with the Institute of Free Teaching, geography constituted educational knowledge both as a means of individual ethical education and as a form of social education. It represented a personal education in so far as the contact with 'the geographical', 'nature' and 'landscape', reveals the ethical code of human behavior, «broadens ones ideas and gives us an accurate picture of our situation and value in the world, researching the physical, topographical and ethnological factors which influence the march of humanity and it's progress, »; and a social education in that it «is, moreover -continues Torres Campos - a science which guides the practical evolution of peoples, works towards a resolution of social problems and teaches us how to obtain the maximum from the planet.» (Torres, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;263).

His preoccupation with expressing a geographical methodology in a renewed form led him to abandon the manuals and to work «from things and not from words and complex terminology learned parrot-fashion, a field trip is worth more than many lessons.» (Torres, 1882, p.&amp;nbsp;9). It was on this basis that the Institute of Free Teaching introduced into its educational methods student excursions and study trips, using theories that had been acquired by Torres Campos during his visits to Paris. These additional methods made it possible to combine scientific theory with ethical and aesthetic aspects thereby giving the subject a deeper reality which it had previously lacked and in turn propagating profounder relationships between teacher and pupil and among the pupils themselves, once one came to understand in situ the institutions and social organization of a nation, without neglecting the aesthetic aspect of education.

«...more than merely compementary to studies, they [field trips] are becoming an educative process; the Institución is trying to make them a normal and frequent part of life, so that our nation may know itself and understand others (......), playing a vital part in the development of the personality and the formation of character. Learning to appreciate circumstances, acquiring the necessary flexibility and to adapt to them, always with discretion and tact, education, in a word, for social interaction, requires experience acquired only with difficulty when we are constantly surrounded by people who think and live in the same way.». (Torres, 1882. p.&amp;nbsp;23-24).

«So that education does not become exclusive and so that industrialization does not harden the heart and create generations indifferent to spiritual matters, it is important not to forget the ideal and aesthetic side of education, to place it alongside the utilitarian.
One normally seeks to inspire a sense of beauty through the Classics, arousing as they do noble sentiments, a taste for literature and art, yet exclusively and narrowly. We pursue the same end through more comprehensive artistic studies which embrace the beautiful in every sphere and in every age.......». (Ibidem, p.&amp;nbsp;33).

Once students have observed and 'intuited' reality through direct contact theory comes to play a complementary role. For such classes Torres Campos devised a Mapa mudo [map without words] of the Iberian peninsular in slate-covered cardboard, possibly the first of its kind in Spain, and brought back from his journeys throughout Europe a wide range of maps and geological sections. In later years and with the same dedication he produced a Colección de Mapas Murales [Collection of Map Murals] in collaboration with P.Vidal de la Blanche.

As well as its educational aspects Geography should help in the reorganisation of the diverse functions of national and international bodies. Torres Campos dedicated himself to this through the Geographical Society of Madrid, in whose name repeated petitions were sent to the Government demanding reform of the curriculum and the introduction of chairs of Geography.

«If Spain does not shortly bring reforming intentions to bear on this matter -commented Torres Campos- if we stubbornly remain one of the countries which ignore Geography and persist with the status quo, then there will be no alternative but the existing harm and the present situation will remain unchanged. Few ministers will know which are our colonial possessions and thus concern themselves with our interests; it will not be possible to form opinions to shape a broad foreign policy and in turn to motivate the search outside Spain for the resources and elements of prosperity that we lack here. There will be a dearth of administrators able to govern and make colonies productive, as there will be of traders and industrialists who could manage their affairs more prosperously, understanding of the complex and sometimes very obscure factors at work in the world and on which today depend prosperity or ruin. An increasingly noticeable weakness, incapacity and impoverishment will be the natural consequence and deserved punishment for our delay and ignorance.» (Torres, 1895, p.&amp;nbsp;262).

It will come as no surprise, then that Torres Campos, in keeping with these ideas, participated actively in colonial affairs and tried to renew, stimulate and extend the teachings of geography, both through the methods followed by the Institute of Free Teaching and by introducing into Spain ideas already in practice in other countries. His participation in the colcnial arena was by way of specific proposals, in which his Krausist inheritance can be clearly seen.

«In all civilisations -stated Torres Campos-, the customs and practices of whichever peiple however barbaric or backward they may seem, are healthy and are a natural consequence of the environment and conditions of the race, which should not be uprooted. It is worth correcting deviation, opposing any denials of the laws fundamental to human life, exercising a certain guidance; but this without making the inferior people an image and likeness of the more civilised one, keeping in mind the aim that it should develop normally, taking from the civilisation with which it comes into contact those things which aare useful or potentially useful to it, in a natural way, by free and autonomous movement. The change should be slow and gradual, without suggesting a radical transformation, rejecting the arbitrary ideal of total assimilation. In short, a colonising people must provide conditions and create stimuli to enable the savages to grow nearer to the former's civilisation, but without imposing the progress in one fell swoop using canons and guns.» (Ibidem p.&amp;nbsp;119.)

So Torres Campos realised that if on the one hand that the environment influences the development of humanity, on the other man can modify the environment and use his own means to reach an Ideal de la Humanidad para la vida [Model Humanity for life]. As preached by Krause/Sanz del Río:

«Any fluvial civilisation - insists Torres Campos - unless it is to perish or to be absorbed into by a broader current, must evolve into a maritime civilisation, communicative and expansive. At first it makes contact with inland seas, the Mediterranean phase; then it reaches the wider context of a great ocean; finally comes the discovery and exploitation of new countries, their colonialization and the development of high speed communication with every important ocean, with which opens the universal period and commerce and a maritime way of life become general throughout the civilisation.» (Torres, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;31.)

The problem consisted in having the knowledge and ability to colonise in accordance with the strong nationalistic ideology extant in Europe, and defining the role of Spain and the Latin race of people in this process. Thus the importance attributed to'the historical sciences, to anthropology and ethnography.

«If the Latin race is to spread and multiply -commented Torres Campos in 1890- if it is to occupy a considerable space on the globe and to number hundreds of millions, creating, in future ethnical trends within the human race, a healthy balance to the Saxons, Slavs and the Chinese -vigorous and expansive peoples par excellence- France must give way to our colonialists, Portugal must preserve the glorious legacy of her explorers, the two Iberian nations must be able to give scope to this population which, more than any other, can transmit by its tongue its own genius and leave, wherever in the world it treads, the mark of its enduring influence.» (Torres, 1895, p.&amp;nbsp;80).

== Influence and Spread of Ideas ==
There is no doubt that if there was no modification of the role of geography in the national curriculum during the last twenty years of the nineteenth century, this was in no way due to a lack of interest or effort on the part of pressure groups such as the Geographic Society of Madrid, some members of which occupied important political positions at this time. Nor were modifications not undertaken out of a lack of a coherent and articulate theoretical corpus, indeed, Torres Campos dedicated much effort to just such theories introducing repeatedly geography teaching methodology developed in other countries and the recommendations of the International Congresses on the subject.

The lack of reform seemed to be caused in part by the inertia of the academic community, its reluctance to accept any change, and secondly and more importantly by the rotational system of the political parties during the Restoration, when the opposition continually impeded any important changes that the reformists might have made.
It was not until 1900, then, after the loss of the last overseas colonies and the subsequent political repercussions, that important changes were introduced into the national curriculum with the creation of chairs of geography. The long struggles by authors like Torres Campos seem diluted by time. In fact all the previous frustrated efforts, and continuous petitioning had prepared the ground. In this way twenty-five years after the introduction of excursionist methods, the use of maps without words and other modern techniques into geography teaching they finally began to be used generally and systematically.

Torres Campos was more successful with the introduction of the new currents in geographical thought, especially those originating in France, which with adaptations from one country to the other, became a school of thought whose influence can be traced to the present.
The work of Torres Campos was therefore constant and anonymous, and as such unrecognised both in his time and ours.

An increased level of chloride in water due to salt application to roads can be widespread in waterways, rather than a local phenomenon of the road edge itself.&lt;ref name="Ramakrishna" /&gt;

==Noise==
Motor vehicle traffic on roads will generate [[noise]], in a wide range of [[Audio frequency|frequencies]] which can affect both humans and animals.

===Negative effects===
[[Noise pollution]] is a factor of environmental degradation that is often overlooked and typically seen as not having a significant effect, though traffic noise can contribute to numerous disturbances for wildlife. An increasing number of studies have been done on the effects of noise on wildlife. Both the sounds made by motors and the wind over moving vehicle structures, and the ultrasonic vibrations transmitted through the air and ground from vehicle passage can overlap with the frequency ranges and amplitudes used by animals for [[Animal communication|communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Clinton D.|last2=Ortega|first2=Catherine P.|last3=Cruz|first3=Alexander|title=Noise Pollution Changes Avian Communities and Species Interactions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982209013281|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=16|pages=1415–1419|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.06.052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shier|first=D.M.|last2=Lea|first2=A.J.|last3=Owen|first3=M.A.|title=Beyond masking: Endangered Stephen’s kangaroo rats respond to traffic noise with footdrumming|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320712001504|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=150|issue=1|pages=53–58|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2012.03.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grade|first=Aaron M.|last2=Sieving|first2=Kathryn E.|date=2016-04-01|title=When the birds go unheard: highway noise disrupts information transfer between bird species|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/4/20160113|journal=Biology Letters|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=20160113|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2016.0113|issn=1744-9561|pmid=27095267|pmc=4881358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies revealed that noise can have a negative effect, particularly on birds. Noise from major roads can interrupt or interfere with the calls of song birds, and their instinctive calls associated with mating, communication, migration, and other purposes are hindered by noise from roads. One study did not necessarily directly provide a fatal effect for the tested birds, but the study showed that species abundance declined around major roads due to noise.&lt;ref name="Fahrig"&gt;Fahrig, Lenore, and Trina Rytwinski. "Effects Of Roads On Animal Abundance: An Empirical Review And Synthesis."Ecology &amp; Society 14.1 (2009): 1-20. Environment Complete. Web. 25 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Noise effects may also modify the behaviour of certain species, such as birds and their feeding behaviours. Birds may spend an increasing amount of time using visual scanning to spot predators as a result of auditory cues and alarm signals from other species being masked by noise pollution. A decreased amount of time spent feeding may lower the mean body weight of birds living near roads, which directly affects their survival rates in a negative fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HABIB|first=LUCAS|last2=BAYNE|first2=ERIN M.|last3=BOUTIN|first3=STAN|date=2007-02-01|title=Chronic industrial noise affects pairing success and age structure of ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapilla|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01234.x|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=176–184|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01234.x|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road noise can be a nuisance if it impinges on population centres, especially for roads at higher operating speeds, near intersections and on uphill sections.  [[Noise health effects]] can be expected in such locations from road systems used by large numbers of motor vehicles.  [[Noise mitigation]] strategies exist to reduce sound levels at nearby sensitive receptors. The idea that road design could be influenced by [[acoustical engineering]] considerations first arose about 1973.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

[[Speed bumps]], which are usually deployed in built-up areas, can increase [[noise pollution]]. This is especially the case if large vehicles use the road and particularly at night.

===Positive effects===
New roads can divert traffic away from population centres thus relieving the [[noise pollution]].  A new road scheme planned in [[Shropshire]], UK promises to reduce traffic noise in [[Shrewsbury]] town centre.&lt;ref name=shrop&gt;{{cite web

Habitat fragmentation may also divide large continuous populations into smaller more isolated populations.&lt;ref name=RMEE/&gt; These smaller populations are more vulnerable to [[genetic drift]], [[inbreeding depression]] and an increased risk of population decline and extinction.&lt;ref name=PRI/&gt; Whether or not this effect is observed depends greatly on the size and mobility of the species in question and the spatial scale at which the fragmetation occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KELLER|first=I.|last2=NENTWIG|first2=W.|last3=LARGIADÈR|first3=C.

The presence of roads also decreases the amount of habitat accessible to species. This is to say that it decreases the amount of usable habitat available to organisms without crossing a road. That being said, whether a habitat on the other side of the road becomes inaccessible to an organism or not varies between species. Roads are a permeable barrier to some organisms and impermeable to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eigenbrod|first=Felix|last2=Hecnar|first2=Stephen J.|last3=Fahrig|first3=Lenore|date=2008-02-01|title=Accessible habitat: an improved measure of the effects of habitat loss and roads on wildlife populations|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-007-9174-7|journal=Landscape Ecology|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=159–168|doi=10.1007/s10980-007-9174-7|issn=0921-2973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain bird populations may then become confined into smaller habitable sites, leading to an increase in possibility of extinction caused by illness or habitat perturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinto|first=Márcia|last2=Rocha|first2=Pedro|last3=Moreira|first3=Francisco|title=Long-term trends in great bustard (Otis tarda) populations in Portugal suggest concentration in single high quality area|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000632070500073X|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=124|issue=3|pages=415–423|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.01.047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilitation of poaching of flora and fauna===
{{Main| Bush meat|Wildlife trade|Illegal logging}}
Roads that run through forests that house edible animals may encourage or facilitate [[poaching]]. Especially in poor areas, the construction of roads has promoted not only poaching for personal consumption but also for sale (for consumption or as a pet) to third parties.

Similarly, the construction of roads in forested areas has also promoted illegal logging as it becomes easier for illegal loggers to transport the wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illegal-logging.info/content/roads-are-ruining-rainforests |title=Roads are ruining the rainforests &amp;#124; Illegal Logging Portal |website=Illegal-logging.info |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation efforts==
===Awareness===
Awareness needs to be spread among drivers particularly those driving on forest road on maintaining speed limits and being vigilant. [[Environment Conservation Group]] had initiated an awareness drive named PATH an acronym for Provide Animals safe Transit on Highways&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryasia.com/magazines/conservation/10297-driven-to-protect-a-journey-across-india-to-document-wild-roadkills.html |title=Driven To Protect – A Journey Across India To Document Wild Roadkills |website=Sanctuaryasia.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering more than 17,000&amp;nbsp;km in India to highlighting the importance of safe driving on forest roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/stop-the-animals-are-crossing/article8029760.ece|title=Stop! The animals are crossing|author=K. Jeshi|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|access-date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road permeability===
[[Wildlife crossings]] that allow [[animal]]s to safely cross human-made barriers such as roads, are intended not only to reduce roadkill, but ideally to provide connectivity of habitat areas, combating [[habitat fragmentation]].&lt;ref name=Forman/&gt; Wildlife crossings may include: [[Tunnel|underpass tunnels]], [[viaduct]]s, and [[overpass]]es.

===Habitat construction and planting===
In Washington County, North Carolina, along Highway 64, a study was conducted to analyze the effects of wildlife underpasses on the local wildlife. Three wildlife underpasses were built with fencing around the highway in the study zones. The study showed that deer used the underpasses the most and made up 93% of all crossings. Mortality rates were calculated and showed that the numbers of deaths were lower near underpasses. This cannot be said about all animals. Some have smaller home ranges so they were not inclined to travel to underpasses to cross the road. Underpass would most likely benefit larger mammals such as bears, deer, and cougars. Underpasses were seen to lower mortality rates and increase local species ability to adapt to a habitat along a major road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McCollister, Matthew F. |author2=Frank T. Van Manen |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010|title=Effectiveness of Wildlife Underpasses and Fencing to Reduce Wildlife-Vehicle Collisions|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|volume=74|issue=8|pages=1722–1731|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2009-535|doi=10.2193/2009-535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recycling===
Materials removed from a road can be reused in construction within the same project&lt;ref name=SCS&gt;
{{cite journal

|doi= 10.1016/j.scs.2014.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in other locations. Road construction can also use waste materials from other industries.

Asphalt pavement is one of the most recycled materials in the United States. It is estimated that over 80% of asphalt pavement removed from roadways is reused as [[construction aggregate]]. It can be mixed into new pavement or used as a subbase or fill material. Similarly, concrete from road or building demolition can be an excellent source of aggregate.&lt;ref name=waste&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/infrastructure/structures/97148/ |title=User Guidelines for Waste and Byproduct Materials in Pavement Construction |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date= 2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common examples of waste products used in road building include coal [[fly ash]] (used to make concrete stronger), asphalt shingles and shredded [[waste tire|tire]]s (used in asphalt pavement), ground glass  and steel mill [[slag]] (used as aggregates).&lt;ref name=waste/&gt;

In 2012, US asphalt plants used an estimated 68.3 million tons of reclaimed asphalt pavement, 1.86 million tons of recycled asphalt shingles, and over 1 million tons of other recycled materials to produce new asphalt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdrecycler.com/napa-survey-recycled-asphalt.aspsx |title=Survey finds growth in recycled materials for asphalt |work=Construction and Demolition Recycling |date=February 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223141734/http://www.cdrecycler.com/napa-survey-recycled-asphalt.aspsx |archivedate=February 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''seascape''' is a [[photograph]], [[painting]], or other [[work of art]] which depicts the [[sea]], in other words an example of [[marine art]].  The word originated as a formation from [[landscape]], which was first used of images of land in art.  By a similar development, "seascape" has also come to mean actual views of the sea itself, and to be applied in [[urban planning|planning contexts]] to geographical locations possessing a good view of the sea.

==Planning use==
[[File:Clifton Beach 5.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A seascape photograph at [[Clifton Beach, Tasmania|Clifton Beach]], [[South Arm, Tasmania|South Arm]], [[Tasmania]], Australia]]

In the UK a seascape is defined in planning and land use contexts as a combination of adjacent land, [[coastline]] and [[sea]] within an area, defined by a mix of land-sea inter-visibility and coastal landscape character assessment, with major headlands forming division points between one seascape area and the next.  This approach to coastal [[landscape planning]] was developed jointly by Government environmental bodies in [[Wales]] (UK) and [[Ireland]] in 2000 to assist spatial planning for (at that time new) [[offshore wind farm]] developments.  The resulting "Guide to best practice in seascape assessment &lt;ref&gt;[http://oar.marine.ie/bitstream/10793/553/1/INTERREG%205%20Guide%20to%20Best%20Practice%20in%20Seascape%20Assessment.pdf  Guide to the Best Practice in Seascape Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;", (Marine Institute, Ireland, 2001), have since been adapted and applied in [[Scotland]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/pubs/detail.asp?id=419]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}(Scottish Natural Heritage, UK, 2004) and in [[England]] {{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file22852.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100304133237/http%3A//www.berr.gov.uk/files/file22852.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-04 |df= }}(Defra, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100405015051/http://www.ccw.gov.uk/landscape--wildlife/protecting-our-landscape/assessing-seascapes/seascape-assessment.aspx] (Countryside Council for Wales, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; for guidance to offshore wind farm developers and for carrying out spatial planning assessments.

Meanwhile, the word has also been adopted in England &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.8684](English Heritage, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the historic and archaeological character areas of the sea - a different but complementary methodological approach encompassing what lies beneath the sea surface.  This use of the word departs from the focus on scenery and visual perception, relying instead just on cognitive perception (what lies beneath the sea surface is out of sight to most of us).

The [[Welsh language]] already distinguishes between 'Morluniau' (seascape in the traditional sense of a [[picture]], [[Perspective (visual)|view]] or [[painting]]) and 'Morweddau' (seascape as a distinct, geographical area exhibiting particular characteristics and qualities).  There is no such distinction in the English language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8490">'''Stockholm City Centre''' (''Stockholms innerstad'', ''Innerstaden'', ''Inre staden'') is the [[city centre]]{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} of [[Stockholm]] in [[Sweden]]. The entire city of Stockholm is also the centre of the [[Metropolitan Stockholm|Stockholm Metropolitan Area]].

Since 2007, Stockholm City Centre is organized into four ''stadsdelsområden'' (sometimes translated to [[Boroughs of Stockholm|boroughs]]): [[Kungsholmen (borough)|Kungsholmen]], [[Södermalm]], [[Norrmalm]] and [[Östermalm]].&lt;ref name="bydistricts"&gt;City of Stockholm: [http://stockholm.se/-/English/Stockholm-by-districts/ "Stockholm by districts"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218065732/http://stockholm.se/-/English/Stockholm-by-districts/ |date=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2007, Stockholm City Centre was organized into five boroughs: [[Katarina-Sofia borough]], [[Kungsholmen borough]], [[Maria-Gamla stan borough]], [[Norrmalm borough]] and [[Östermalm borough]].

The border between the historical [[Provinces of Sweden|provinces]] of [[Södermanland]] and [[Uppland]] splits Stockholm City Centre in two parts. 179,185 people live on an area of 28.05&amp;nbsp;km² in the northern (Uppland) part, which gives a density of 6,388.06/km².{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The same data for the southern (Södermanland) part is 103,646 people on 7.44&amp;nbsp;km², giving a density of 13,930.91/km².{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} This border is purely historical and has no administrative significance whatsoever.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6353">'''Tao-Klarjeti''' ({{lang-ka|ტაო-კლარჯეთი}}) is a part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] historical region of [[Zemo Kartli|Upper Kartli]] and the term is based on the names of two most important provinces of the region — [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] and [[Klarjeti]]. 

== Geography ==
Tao-Klarjeti completely covers the basin of river [[Chorokhi]] and the toponym doesn't extend beyond its boundaries. Therefore in Tao is meant that territory of the basin of riv. Chorokhi which starts in the confluence of rivers Imerkhevi and Chorokhi and continues towards [[Bayburt]], while the part of the basin of riv. Chorokhi which starts in [[Imerkhevi]] and continues before the shores of [[Black Sea]] is Klarjeti. Tao itself is divided into the territories of [[Speri]] and [[Taoni]] and Klarjeti consists territories of the basin of riv. Imerkhevi such as [[Shavsheti]] and [[Imerkhevi]]. Part of Klarjeti which is located from Imerkhevi-Chrokhi confluence before Black sea has been divided into the valleys of [[Nigali valley|Nigali]], [[Adjara|Ajara]] and [[Machakhela]]. Lots of Georgian important cultural monuments from the [[middle ages]] are located on the territory of Tao-Klarjeti and many of them are preserved as ruins.

Georgian states also included the historical province of [[Basiani]]. Other provinces from South-Western Georgia, such as [[Göle|Kola]], [[Ardahan|Artaani]] and [[Erusheti]] are also part of upper kartli historical region.

== History ==
The region of Tao-Klarjeti has been under the influence of many states and empires during its long history. In the ancient past the [[Diauehi|Kingdom of Diaokhi]] arose in the center of it. Tao-Klarjeti has become the cultural and political center of Georgian statehood in [[Early Middle Ages|early]] and [[High Middle Ages|high medieval period]] when the [[Principality of Iberia]] got renovated by [[Ashot I of Iberia|Ashot I the Great]]. In 888 [[Adarnase IV of Iberia]] crowned himself as a king. On that day the [[Kingdom of the Kartvels]] (Georgians) originated which existed before the unification of it with the [[Kingdom of the Abkhazes]], establishing [[Kingdom of Georgia|united Georgian state]] in 1008.
The area continued to remain a Georgian territory and was administered by the princes of [[Samtskhe-Saatabago]] until conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1551. During their rule, a policy of [[Islamization]] was implemented and many of the [[Tao-Klarjeti#Architecture|Christian churches]] were converted into [[mosque]]s. Following the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878|Russian-Turkish war]] of 1877-1878, most of the former Tao-Klarjetian territory was ceded to the [[Russian Empire]], but it was taken back by the Turks in the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty]] with the [[Russian SFSR]] in 1918. The Ottoman defeat in [[World War I]] allowed the newly created [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] to regain control of the region. [[Oltu|Olti]] district, which was heavily contested between Georgians and Armenians had stayed under Turkish control. However, the nation’s independence soon collapsed under the Soviet [[Red Army]] attack in February 1921 and simultaneously the area was reoccupied by [[Turkey]], a fact that was acknowledged by the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]] signed between the Turkish and Soviet governments on 16 March 1921.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3408">[[image:Tavoliere.jpg|thumb|300px|The Tavoliere seen from the [[Gargano]] promontory.]]
The '''Tavoliere delle Puglie''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: "Table of the Apulias", {{IPA-it|tavoˈljɛːre delle ˈpuʎʎe|pron}}) is a [[plain]] in northern [[Apulia]], southern Italy, occupying nearly a half of the [[Capitanata]] traditional region. It covers a surface of c. 3,000&amp;nbsp;km², once constituting a sea bottom: it is bounded by the [[Monti Dauni|Daunian Pre-Apennines]] on the West, the [[Gargano Promontory]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] on the East, by the [[Fortore]] river on the north, and the [[Ofanto]] river on the south. It is the largest Italian plain after the [[Pianura Padana]].

The name ''Tavoliere'' derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''Tabulae censuariae'', tables on which the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] classified the areas devoted to sheep farming or agriculture.

In winter the plain is sometimes subject to [[flood]]s by the Ofanto and the Fortore, while in summer [[drought]] is frequent.

The main centres, from north to south, are [[San Severo]], [[Lucera (FG)|Lucera]], [[Foggia]] and [[Cerignola]].

==History==
Neolithic farmers living in Tavoliere over 7000 years ago practiced [[Excarnation|ritual defleshing of the dead]]. Light cut marks on the bones suggest the bones were defleshed up to a year after death. They deposited the bones in Scaloria Cave. The human bones were mixed with animal bones, broken pottery and stone tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/archaeology/2015/03/stone-age-italians-defleshed-their-dead |title=Stone-age Italians defleshed their dead |last1=Shaw |first1=Garry |last2= |first2= |date=27 March 2015 |website=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |access-date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]] the old practices of agriculture and  fluvial regulation were lost, the plain being mostly devoted to sheep farming which, using apposite cattle-tracks, reached the Apennines' pasture lands through the Tavoliere. The lands was most marshy and unhealthy.

After extensive works of drainage, the plain is now highly cultivated. Crops include [[wheat]], [[beet]], [[tomato]], especially in the area of [[Foggia]], while also spread are cultivations of [[olive]]s and [[grapes]], which produce quality oils and  wines.

==Communes==
The ''[[comune|comuni]]'' in the Tavoliere delle Puglie are:

[[Ascoli Satriano]], Alberona, Apricena [[Biccari]]; [[Bovino (FG)|Bovino]], [[Candela (FG)|Candela]], [[Carapelle (FG)|Carapelle]], [[Casalvecchio di Puglia]], [[Castelluccio dei Sauri]], [[Castelnuovo della Daunia]], [[Cerignola]], [[Chieuti]], [[Deliceto]], [[Foggia]], [[Lucera]], [[Manfredonia]], [[Margherita di Savoia (FG)|Margherita di Savoia]], [[Ordona]] (''Herdonia''[http://www.arcadria.eu/immagini/foto/Adriatica/pannelli/ORDONA.jpg]), [[Orta Nova]], [[Poggio Imperiale]], [[San Ferdinando di Puglia]], [[San Paolo di Civitate]], [[San Severo]], [[Serracapriola]], [[Stornara]], [[Stornarella]], [[Torremaggiore]], [[Trinitapoli]], [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], [[Volturino]], [[Zapponeta]].

A '''thalassocracy''' (from [[Classical Greek]] {{lang|grc|θάλασσα}} (''thalassa''), meaning "sea", and {{lang|grc|κρατεῖν}} (''kratein''), meaning "power", giving [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|θαλασσοκρατία}} (''thalassokratia''), "sea power") is a state with primarily maritime realms, an [[empire]] at sea (such as the [[Phoenicia]]n network of merchant cities) or a seaborne empire.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Traditional thalassocracies seldom dominate interiors, even in their home territories: Phoenician [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], or [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. One can distinguish this traditional sense of ''thalassocracy'' from an "empire", where the state's territories, though possibly linked principally or solely by the [[sea lane]]s, generally extend into mainland interiors: the [[Bruneian Empire]] (1368–1888) in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= P.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''thalassocracy'' can also simply refer to [[command of the sea|naval supremacy]], in either military or commercial senses of the word ''supremacy''. The [[Ancient Greeks]] first used the word ''thalassocracy'' to describe the government of the [[Minoan civilization]], whose power depended on its navy.&lt;ref&gt;
D. Abulafia, "Thalassocracies", in P. Horden – S. Kinoshita (eds.), ''A Companion to Mediterranean History'', Oxford, 2014, pp. 139–153, here 139–140.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] distinguishes sea-power from land-power and spoke of the need to counter the Phoenician thalassocracy by developing a Greek "empire of the sea".&lt;ref&gt; A. Momigliano, "Sea-Power in Greek Thought", The Classical Review, May 1944, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Image:PhoenicianTrade.png|thumb|left|The Phoenician trade routes in the Mediterranean.]]

There are many ancient examples besides those mentioned above, such as the [[Delian League]]. Aside from this example, which was an empire based primarily on naval power and control of waterways and not on any land possessions, the [[Middle Ages]] saw its fair share of thalassocracies, often land-based empires which controlled the sea. Among the most famous is the [[Republic of Venice]], conventionally divided in the fifteenth century into the ''[[Dogado]]'' of Venice and the Lagoon, the ''[[Domini di Terraferma|Stato di Terraferma]]'' of Venetian holdings in northern Italy, and the ''[[Stato da Màr]]'' of the Venetian outlands bound by the sea:
{{quote|This was a scattered empire, reminiscent, though on a very different scale, of the [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] and later the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch empires]] in the Indian Ocean, a trading-post empire forming a long [[Capitalism|capitalist]] antenna; an empire 'on the Phoenician model', to use a more ancient parallel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fernand Braudel]], ''The Perspective of the World'', vol. III of ''Civilization and Capitalism'' (Harper &amp; Row) 1984:119.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 7th to 15th century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], the thalassocracies of [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] controlled the sea lanes in Southeast Asia and exploited the spice trade of the [[Maluku islands|Spice Islands]], as well as maritime trade routes between [[India]] and [[China]].

Nearly contemporaneous, the [[Republic of Ragusa]] can be seen as a "thalassocracy", a competitor to Venice.

The [[Early Middle Ages]] ({{c.}} 500 – 1000 AD) saw many of the coastal cities of the [[Mezzogiorno]] develop into minor thalassocracies whose chief powers lay in their ports and their ability to sail navies to defend friendly coasts and ravage enemy ones. These include the variously Greek and [[Lombards|Lombard]] duchies of [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]]. Later, northern Italy developed its own trade empires based on [[Pisa]] and especially the powerful [[Republic of Genoa]], that rivaled with [[Venice]] (these three, along with Amalfi, were to be called the ''[[Repubbliche marinare]]'', i.e. Maritime Republics).

It was with the modern age, the [[Age of Exploration]], that some of the most remarkable thalassocracies emerged. Anchored in their European territories, several nations established colonial empires held together by naval supremacy. First among them was the [[Portuguese Empire]], followed soon by the [[Spanish Empire]], which was challenged by the [[Dutch Empire]], itself replaced on the high seas by the [[British Empire]], whose landed possessions were immense and held together by the greatest navy of its time. With naval arms races (especially between [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]) and the end of colonialism and the granting of independence to these colonies, European thalassocracies, which had controlled the world's oceans for centuries, ceased to be.

'''Yalode''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|d|i}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://ac.arc.nasa.gov/p52jvs37ff1/?launcher=false&amp;fcsContent=true&amp;pbMode=normal]&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest confirmed crater on Ceres after [[Kerwan (crater)|Kerwan]]. It is adjacent to another large crater, [[Urvara (crater)|Urvara]]. It is named after the [[Dahomey]]an deity of the yam harvest, Yalodé. It appears to have a series of canyons running from it, in a northwestern direction. These may be ejecta from it. The canyons have been collectively named [[Samhain Catena]].
