==Early life==
Aarudra was born in [[Yelamanchili]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], India on 31 August 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/arudra-birth-anniversary/article5081827.ece|title=Arudra birth anniversary|date=1 September 2013|publisher=|via=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the primary education, he shifted to [[Vizianagaram]] in 1942 for his college education.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hinduonnet.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"/&gt; He got attracted to [[Communism]] after coming into contact with people like ''Ronanki Appalaswami'' and [[Chaganti Somayajulu]]. He joined the [[Indian Air Force]] as a Band Boy in 1943 and served it till 1947.&lt;ref name="hinduonnet.com"/&gt; He shifted to [[Chennai|Madras]] and worked as editor of ''[[Anandavani]]'' magazine for two years. Joining the cine field in 1949, he wrote lyrics and dialogues for many films. He married noted writer K. Rama Lakshmi (a columnist and a writer-critic in her own right) in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitvizag.in/arudra.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131804/http://www.visitvizag.in/arudra.asp |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038010/|title=Arudra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
''Tvamevaham'' (You are none other than me) and ''Samagra Andhra Sahityam'' (An Encyclopedia of Telugu Literature) are his landmark works.&lt;ref name="hinduonnet.com"/&gt; He wrote poetry such as ''Koonalamma Padaalu'',  reminiscences of the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Aarudra, 'Samagra Andhra Sahityam' (1968). Reprinted in 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Aarudra, 'Samagra Aaandhra Saahityam' (2005): Revised and Reprinted, Published by Telugu Akademi, Hyderabad.
&lt;/ref&gt; He translated the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] treatise [[Tirukkuṛaḷ|Tirukkural]] into Telugu.
He belonged to the school of progressive writers such as ''Abhyudaya Rachayitala Sangham''.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/br/2002/05/14/stories/2002051400130303.htm|title=The Hindu : Collection of essays|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu.com3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/muddubidda-1956/article6641010.ece|title=MUDDUBIDDA (1956)|date=28 November 2014|publisher=|via=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Aarudra, 'Samagra Aaandhra Saahityam' (2005): Revised and Reprinted, Published by Telugu Akademi, Hyderabad.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tvamevaham===
''Tvamevaaham'' written in 1948 was based on the contemporary violence and lawlessness during the Razakar movement in [[Hyderabad State|the princely state of Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name="thehindu.com1"/&gt; The Razakar attrocoties were sponsored by the [[Nizam]] against his own people who wanted to overthrow him in favor of democracy and join the Indian Union.  In this kaavyam, death spoke to a human being and says, "you and I are the same (Tvamevaaham)".&lt;ref name="hinduonnet.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu.com2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu.com3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aarudra, 'Vennela-vesavi', Navodaya Publishers, Vijayawada, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

An imaginary sand clock and a water clock were used by the poet to depict time in ''Tvamevaham''. The `hours' are a symbol of the rich and affluent, the `minutes' denote the attitude of the middle class and the `seconds' are likened to the mentality of the working class. A stop watch was depicted as an instrument to measure `revolution'. The `key' fanned revolution, while the `alarm' was a warning of the prevailing situation.&lt;ref name="hinduonnet.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===The Samagra andhra Sahityam===
Aarudhra first published the SAS in 12 parts between 1965 and 1968.  It spans the Telugu literature from the 9th century [[Common Era|CE]] to modern times. He chronicled the history of Telugu Literature in 12 volumes:
# Early and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya Era]] (From 8 - 9c CE to end of 12c CE)
# [[Kakatiya dynasty]] (1200 - 1290 CE)
# Padmanayaka Era (1337 - 1399 CE)
# Reddiraju Era (1400 - 1450 CE)
# Early Rayala ([[Vijayanagara]]) (1450-1500 CE)
# Later Rayala (Vijayanagara) (1500-1550 CE)
# [[Nawab|Nawabs]] (1550-1600 CE)
# Nayaka Kings (1600- 1670 CE)
# Later Nayaka Kings (1670-1750 CE)
# [[East India Company]] (1750 - 1850 CE)
# [[Zamindar]]i (1850 - 1900 CE)
# Modern (1900 CE onwards)

===How is Sita related to Rama?===
''Ramudiki Sita Yemautundi?'' or ''How is Sita related to Rama?'', put before the public the riddle of [[Mandodari]], [[Sita]] and [[Hanuman]] and their origins in a lucid and scholarly way.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu.com3"/&gt; It was a bold attempt at cracking the [[Valmiki]]-[[Ramayana]] code and in the process de-mystified the story of Rama to the middle-class, literate, modern day Telugu reader.
&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Aarudra, 'Ramudiki Seetemautundi? 'Vishalandra Publishing House, Hyderabad, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu.com1"/&gt;

The book explores the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] sources of the story of [[Rama]].&lt;ref name="thehindu.com1"/&gt; It also surveys the Khotan Siam ([[Thai people|Thai]]), [[Laos]], and [[Malaysia]]n versions of the story of Rama. Here is a sampling from the  'Dasaratha Jataka ', a Buddhist Tale:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Buddha narrates the 'Dasaratha Jataka' tale to a householder who was grieving the death of his son....Long long ago.. Dasaratha was the king of Varanasi.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; He had sixteen thousand wives.The Queen had two sons and a daughter.The eldest son was called Ramapundit and the younger one was called Laxmanpundit.The daughter was called Sitadevi. The Queen dies after sometime. Dasaratha marries again, and comes to like her the most. She begets a son named Bharata...When Ramapundit returns from the forest, he marries Sita and rules for 16000 years...Bodhisatta concludes the story stating that Dasaratha was none other than Shuddhodana (Father of Buddha) in an earlier reincarnation. Similarly, Sita was none other than Rahulmata(Mother of Rahul or Wife of Buddha) and Ramapundit was none other than Buddha himself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu.com1"/&gt;

Aarudra's questions like "How is Sita related to Rama?" or "Were they just Husband and wife?" may sound naive or sacrilegious but a serious study of [[Genealogy|genealogies]], as revealed from different sources, logically leads to them. To deny the existence of such stories, per Arudra, would amounted to intellectual dishonesty.

The '''Athenian coinage decree''' also known as the '''Standards decree''' was a decree made by the [[Athenian]]s to standardise currency amongst the states they were allied with. Between the years of 450 and 447BCE, the use of Athenian [[silver]] currency and Athenian [[weights and measures]] was made obligatory in all allied states of the [[Athenian Empire]].&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Greece to 322 B.C.|last=Hammond|first=N.G.L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1959|isbn=0-19-873095-0|location=Oxford|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scholarly opinion is split in regards to the dating of the Athenian Coinage Decree. Various fragments from cities allied to Athens have been used to reconstruct the decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aspects of Greek History|last=Buckley|first=Terry|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-54977-6|location=London|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree required that all allied currencies be taken out of circulation and melted down to be replaced with [[Attic Greek|Attic]] coins, with a small difference in the [[exchange rate]] favouring Athens; the Athenian [[Mint (facility)|mint]] benefited as the allies’ mints were closed down. This encouraged the flow of trade through the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and especially between Athens and the allied states. However, the measure did impinge upon the autonomy of the allied states.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt; The use of Athenian currency had become increasingly common, especially with smaller states, but many continued to mint their own coins with their own state symbol. The result was that the overall volume of trade in the Aegean increased, but with greater domination by Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Greece|last=Bury|first=J.B|publisher=Palgrave|year=1900|isbn=978-0-333-15493-9|location=New York|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Belhare''' ({{lang-ne|Belhāreor}}), also known as '''Athpariya II''' (not to be confused with [[Athpare language|Athpariya I]]), is a [[Kiranti languages|Kiranti]] language spoken by some 2,000 people living on Belhara Hill, at the southern foothills of the Himalayas situated in the [[Dhankuta District]], [[Kosi Zone]] in eastern [[Nepal]]. All speakers of Belhare are bilingual in [[Nepali language|Nepali]], which results in frequent [[Code-switching|code mixing]] and a large amount of Nepali loan-words. Nevertheless, the grammar of Belhare has maintained its distinct Kiranti characteristics.&lt;br&gt;

Like other [[Kiranti languages]], Belhare is characterized by an elaborate morphology in both the nominal and verbal domain. Syntactically, Belhare has partly an [[nominative–accusative language|accusative]], partly an [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] [[syntactic pivot|pivot]], but accusative syntax is more prominent in terms of frequency.

The '''Burgundian language''', also known by [[French language|French]] names '''Bourguignon-morvandiau,''' '''Bourguignon,''' and '''Morvandiau,''' is an [[Oïl language]] spoken in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and particularly in the [[Morvan]] area of the region.

The arrival of the [[Burgundians]] brought [[Burgundian language (Germanic)|Germanic]] elements into the Gallo-Romance speech of the inhabitants. The occupation of the [[Low Countries]] by the [[Dukes of Burgundy]] also brought Burgundian into contact with Dutch; e.g., the word for [[gingerbread]] ''couque'' derives from Old Dutch ''kooke'' (cake).

Dialects of the south along the [[Saône]] river, such as Brionnais-Charolais, have been influenced by the [[Arpitan language]], which is spoken mainly in a neighbouring area that approximates the heartland of the original [[Kingdom of Burgundy]].

Eugène de Chambure published a ''Glossaire du Morvan'' in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;''Le morvandiau tel qu'on le parle'', Roger Dron, Autun 2004, (no ISBN)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Apart from songs dating from the eighteenth century, there is little surviving [[literature]] from before the nineteenth century. In 1854 the [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' was translated into the Morvan dialect by the Abbé Jacques-François Baudiau, and into the [[Dijon]] dialect by the Abbé Lereuil. The Abbé Baudiau also transcribed storytelling.

Folklorists collected [[vernacular literature]] from the mid-nineteenth century and by the end of the century a number of writers were establishing an original literature. [[Achille Millien]] (1838–1927) collected songs from the [[oral tradition]] in the Nivernais. Louis de Courmont, nicknamed the "[[Théodore Botrel|Botrel]] of the Morvan," was a chansonnier who after a career in Paris returned to his native region. A statue was erected to him in [[Château-Chinon (Ville)|Château-Chinon]]. Emile Blin wrote a number of stories and monologues aimed at a tourist market; a collection was published in 1933 under the title ''Le Patois de Chez Nous.'' Alfred Guillaume published a large number of vernacular texts for use on picturesque postcards at the beginning of the twentieth century, and in 1923 published a book in Burgundian, ''L'âme du Morvan.'' More recently, Marinette Janvier published ''Ma grelotterie'' (1974) and ''Autour d'un teugnon'' (1989).

'''Cora''' is an [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous language of Mexico]] of the [[uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] [[Historical linguistics|language family]]. It is spoken by the ethnic group that is widely known as the [[Cora people|Cora]] but who refer to themselves as ''Naáyarite''. The Cora inhabit the northern sierra of the Mexican state [[Nayarit]] which is named after its indigenous inhabitants. Cora is a [[Languages of Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican language]] and shows many of the traits defining the [[Mesoamerican Linguistic Area]]. Under the [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples]] it is recognized as a "national language" along with 62 other indigenous languages and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] which have the same "validity" in Mexico [https://web.archive.org/web/20070208095913/http://www.sep.gob.mx/work/resources/LocalContent/62817/12/ley_gen_derechos_ling_indigenas_2.htm].

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Del Nayar localidades.svg|thumb|right|Main communities where Cora is spoken in the Nayar municipality.]]
Ethnologue distinguishes two main variants of Cora. One is called ''Cora del Nayar'' or ''Cora Meseño'' and is spoken mainly in and around the medium-altitude settlements of [[Mesa de Nayar]] and [[Conel Gonzales]] in the south of the [[el Nayar]] municipality of [[Nayarit]], and has approximately 9,000 speakers (1993 census). There are significant differences between some of these varieties and some sources distinguish between ''Cora Mariteco'' (of Jesus Maria), ''Cora Presideño'' (of Presidio de los Reyes), ''Cora Corapeño'' (of San Juan Corapan) and ''Cora Franciscqueño'' (of San Francisco). But Ethnologue considers the mutual intelligibilitiy between these and ''Meseño'' to be high enough to classify them as a single language.

The other variant recognized by the Ethnologue is called ''Cora de Santa Teresa'' or ''Cora Tereseño'' and is spoken by approximately 7,000 people (1993 census), for the most part in the high sierra in the north of [[el Nayar]]. Cora de Santa Teresa has such a low degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with other Cora speech communities that [[Ethnologue]] considers it a separate variety. Due to recent migrations a small community of Coras exists in the United States in western Colorado.

==Dialects==
Cora speakers themselves recognize only five dialects: Cora de Jesús María, Cora de Mesa de Nayar, Cora de Sta. Teresa, Cora de Corápan and Cora de San Francisco. Highland speakers consider Cora of Preseidio de los Reyes to be identical to the dialect of the other lowland community Corápan, and Cora of Dolores to be identical to Cora of Sta Teresa.&lt;ref&gt;Wá'mwatye náayeri nyúuka: curso de cora como segunda lengua. Universidad Autónoma de Nayarit, 2014 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Cora is spoken in a number of dialects, some of which have difficult mutual intelligibility. ISO distinguishes two languages, INALI nine.

:El Nayar Cora / Jesús María Cora (Cora Mariteco)
:Dolores Cora
:Rosarito Cora
:San Blasito Cora
:San Juan Corapan Cora (Cora Corapeño)
:Santa Teresa Cora (Cora Tereseño)
:La Mesa del Nayar Cora (Cora Meseño)
:Presidio de los Reyes Cora (Cora Presideño)
:San Francisco Cora (Cora Francisqueño)

==Classification==
The closest relatives of the Cora language is the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] language together with which it forms the [[Coracholan]] subgroup of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages]]. The Taracahitan group of languages containing among others the languages [[Tarahumara language|Tarahumara]],  [[Yaqui language|Yaqui]] and [[Mayo language|Mayo]] is also related to Cora.

==Phonology==
The phonology of Cora is typical of southern Uto-Aztecan languages, with five vowels and a relatively simple consonant inventory. However atypically of Uto-aztecan languages, Cora has developed a simple [[tonal languages|tonal system]] or [[pitch accent]] with an harmonic accent taking high falling tone.

==Grammar==
Cora is a verb-initial language; its grammar is [[agglutinative]] and [[polysynthetic]], particularly inflecting verbs with many affixes and clitics. There are a number of adpositional clitics that can also be used as [[relational nouns]].

===Nominal morphology===
Nouns are marked for possession and exhibit several different plural patterns.

====Pluralization====
Different classes of nouns mark the plural in different manners. The most common way is by means of suffixes - The suffixes used for pluralization are the following: -''te'', -''mwa'', -''mwa'a'', -''tse'', -''tsi'', -''kʉ'', -''sʉ'', -''se'', -''si'', -''ri'' and -''i''. Other ways to form the plural is by reduplication of the final vowel of a noun stem or by shifting the accent from one syllable to the other. Another class of works form their plurals by [[suppletion]].

====Possession====
Possessed nouns are marked with a prefix expressing the person and number of their possessor. 
The forms of the prefix expressing first person singular is ''ne''-, ''na''-, or ''ni''-, for second person singular it is ''a''-, ''mwa'a''-, ''a'a''-. The third person singular is marked by the prefix ''ru''-.  A first person plural possessor is marked by the prefix ''ta''-, second person plural by ''ha'amwa''- and third person plural by ''wa'a''-. Furthermore, there are two suffixes. One, -''ra'an'' is used to mark an [[obviative]] or [[fourth person]] possessor. The other is -''me'en'' used to mark a plural possessum of a singular possessor.

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" width="40%"

|''há'amwachi'i''  "Your (pl.) house"

|''chí'ira'an'' "the house of the other"
|
|-
|'''pl. possessum + 3.p.sg. possessor'''
|''chí'imeen'' "his/her houses"
|
|}

===Verbal morphology===
Verbs are inflected for person and number of subject and direct object and object prefixes for 3rd person inanimate objects also show the basic shape of the object. Verbs are also inflected for location and direction.

===Syntax===
Typologically Cora is interesting because it is a VSO language but also has postpositions, a trait that is rare cross-linguistically but does occur in a few Uto-Aztecan languages ([[Tohono O'odham|Papago]], [[Tepehuán]], and some dialects of [[Nahuatl]]).

==Media==
Cora-language programming is carried by the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples|CDI]]'s radio station [[XEJMN-AM]], broadcasting from [[Jesús María, Nayarit]].

In [[ballet]], the '''''corps de ballet''''' {{IPA-fr|kɔʁ də balɛ|}} (from [[French language|French]], ''body of the ballet'') is the group of dancers who are not soloists. They are a permanent part of the [[ballet company]] and often work as a [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] for the [[principal dancer]]s. A ''corps de ballet'' works as one, with synchronized movements and corresponding positioning on the stage.

The leading dancer in a Corps de ballet is a [[Ballet dancer|Coryphée]]. Specific roles are sometimes made for the corps de ballet, such as the Snow Corps de Ballet and the Flower Corps in ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.

'''Desano''' is a [[Tucanoan languages|Tucanoan language]] of [[Colombia]] and [[Brazil]].  There are several alternative names, including Boleka, Desâna, and Kusibi.  It is located primarily in the Northwest Brazil and Southern Colombia.

==Location==

The primary concentration of Desano people is on the Tiquié River in Brazil and Colombia.  This region is populated by a number of other ethnic communities, most notably the [[Hup people]], with whom they share several linguistic and cultural characteristics.

==Characteristics==
The Desano language has 90% lexical similarity to the [[Siriano language]]. The language is reported to have a form of whistled speech.&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{Ethnologue18|des}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Desano people have faced influence from outsiders when the Spanish and Portuguese explored the region.  These people brought outside illnesses, one being [[measles]], which negatively impacted the surrounding communities.  These explorers also introduced [[Christianity]] into the region.

'''Dorothy Pentreath''' (16 May 1692 [baptised] &amp;ndash; 26 December 1777), known as '''Dolly''', was a speaker of the [[Cornish language]]. She is the best-known of the last fluent, native speakers of the [[Cornish language]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Baptised on 16 May 1692,&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{Cite ODNB|first=Matthew|last=Spriggs|title=Pentreath , Dorothy (bap. 1692, d. 1777)|date=2004|id=14692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pentreath was probably the second of the six children of fisherman Nicholas Pentreath and his second wife Jone Pentreath.&lt;ref&gt;W.&amp;nbsp;T. Hoblyn, "The probable parentage of Dorothy Pentreath", in ''Old Cornwall'', 3/11 (1936), pp. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; She later claimed that she could not speak a word of English until the age of 20. Whether or not this is correct, Cornish was her first language.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In old age, she remembered that as a child she had sold fish at [[Penzance]] in the Cornish language, which most local inhabitants (even the [[gentry]]) then understood.&lt;ref name=ellis&gt;Peter Berresford Ellis, ''The Cornish language and its literature'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=L709AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pp. 115–118] online&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in the parish of [[Paul, Cornwall|Paul]], next to [[Mousehole]].

Perhaps due to poverty, Pentreath never married, but in 1729 she gave birth to a son, John Pentreath, who lived until 1778.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Pentreath is described as having been "the old matriarch of the Cornish language [...] Dolly was a Cornish fishwife who tramped her fishy wares around Penwith and Penzance. At the latter place she gained the reputation of being the last native Cornish speaker, though she may not have been. Opinion is also divided about how much Cornish she could actually speak - though everyone agreed she could swear in Cornish." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/qWv9dnnORZaEiEkG0ID8Lw||title=Dolly Pentreath|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years, death, and legacy===

In 1768, [[Daines Barrington]] searched Cornwall for speakers of the language and at [[Mousehole]] found Pentreath, then a fish seller said to be aged about 82, who "could speak Cornish very fluently." In 1775 he published an account of her in the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]' journal ''Archaeologia'' in an article called "On the Expiration of the Cornish Language." Barrington noted that the "hut in which she lived was in a narrow lane," and that in two rather better cottages just opposite it he had found two other women, some ten or twelve years younger than Pentreath, who could not speak Cornish readily, but who understood it. Five years later, Pentreath was said to be 87 years old and at the time her hut was "poor and maintained mostly by the parish, and partly by [[fortune telling]] and gabbling Cornish."&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt;

In the last years of her life, Pentreath became a local celebrity for her knowledge of Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;Barrington, "On the expiration of the Cornish language", p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1777, she was painted by [[John Opie]] (1761–1807), and in 1781 an engraving of her after [[Robert Scaddan]] was published.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In 1797, a Mousehole fisherman told [[Richard Polwhele]] (1760–1838) that William Bodinar "used to talk with her for hours together in Cornish; that their conversation was understood by scarcely any one of the place; that both Dolly and himself could talk in English."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Polwhele]], ''The History of Cornwall'', (7 volumes, 1803–1808), vol. 5, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Her own account as recorded by [[Daines Barrington]] indicates she also spoke English.

Dolly Pentreath has passed into legend for cursing people in a long stream of fierce Cornish whenever she became angry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=J. Henry|title=Dolly Pentreath: The Fish-Wife of Mousehole|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/legend/cornish/cornss03.html|publisher=Britannia.com|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her death is seen as marking the death of Cornish as a community language.

There are many tales about her. She was said often to curse people, including calling them "''kronnekyn hager du''," an "ugly black toad," and was even said to have been a [[witch]]. Numerous other stories have been attached to her, their accuracy unknown. She was at one time thought to have been identical with a Dorothy Jeffrey or Jeffery whose burial is recorded in the Paul parish register, but this has been doubted (however the ''Oxford DNB'' (2004) does accept the identification).

==Monument==
[[File:Monument to Dolly Pentreath - geograph.org.uk - 780405.jpg|thumb|Monument dedicated to Dolly Pentreath at Paul|alt=A grey granite monument set into a stone wall of a church]]
Dolly Pentreath was buried at Paul, where in 1860 a monument in her honour was set into the churchyard wall of the church of [[Paul Aurelian|St Paul Aurelian]] by [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]], a nephew of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], and by the Vicar of Paul of the time. It read: {{quote|Here lieth interred Dorothy Pentreath who died in 1777, said to have been the last person who conversed in the ancient Cornish, the peculiar language of this country from the earliest records till it expired in the eighteenth century, in this Parish of Saint Paul. This stone is erected by the Prince Louis Bonaparte in Union with the Revd John Garret Vicar of St Paul, June 1860. Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. Exod. xx. 12. Gwra pethi de taz ha de mam: mal de Dythiow bethenz hyr war an tyr neb an arleth de dew ryes dees. Exod. xx. 12.&lt;ref name="Ellis1974"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Peter Berresford|title=The Cornish language and its literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L709AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA135|accessdate=6 November 2011|year=1974|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-7928-2|pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Contradicting the monument, in 1882 Dr Frederick Jago of Plymouth received a letter from Bernard Victor, of Mousehole, who wrote "She died Decr. 26, 1777, at the age of 102. At her funeral the undertaker was George Badcock. He being my grandfather, that is the reason I am so well informed ; and there were eight chosen fishermen bearers to take her to her last resting place. There was not anything erected on the old lady's grave as a tablet to her memory. I know quite well the grave where her remains are deposited." In a later letter he went on to say that it was no surprise that Bonaparte and Garret had mistaken both the date and the place of the grave. "Dolly's actual resting place is 47 feet south-east, a point easterly from Prince L.&amp;nbsp;L. Bonaparte's monument to her. It is not to be said that the monument is in its right place, because it was put there by the order of Prince L.&amp;nbsp;L. Bonaparte, or by the Rev. John Garrett&amp;nbsp;– the one a Frenchman and the other an Irishman!"&lt;ref&gt;Fred. W.&amp;nbsp;P. Jago, ''The Ancient Language, and the Dialect of Cornwall'' (Truro: Netherton &amp; Worth, 1882), pp. 336–337&lt;/ref&gt; However, the erroneous idea that Pentreath had lived to be 102 is believed to originate in a Cornish language epitaph which had been written by December 1789 and published in 1806 by a man named Tomson.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

No burial of Dorothy Pentreath is recorded, but it has been argued that this appears in the [[parish register]] under the name of Dolly Jeffery, which is suggested to be the surname of her son's father. This theory is accepted by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In 1887, the monument was moved to the site of her unmarked grave, and a skeleton was disinterred which was believed to be hers.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; [[Pêr-Jakez Helias]], the [[Breton people|Breton]] writer, has dedicated a poem to Dolly Pentreath.

==Last Cornish speaker==
{{main|Last speaker of Cornish}}
As with many other "last native speakers," there is controversy over Pentreath's status. Her true claim to notability is not as the last speaker of the language, but rather as its last fluent native speaker.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

After her death, Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in [[Mousehole]] named [[William Bodinar]] (or Bodener) stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also speaks of a [[John Nancarrow]] from [[Marazion]] who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, P. Berresford, ''The Story of the Cornish Language'' (Truro: Tor Mark Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, P. Berresford (1974) ''The Cornish Language and its Literature''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one known traditional Cornish speaker, John Mann, who as a child in Boswednack, Zennor, always conversed in Cornish with other children, and was alive at the age of 80 in 1914. He was the last known survivor of a number of traditional Cornish speakers of the 19th century including Jacob Care of St Ives (d. 1892); Elizabeth Vingoe of Higher Boswarva, Madron (d.&amp;nbsp;1903 and who taught at least some Cornish to her son); [[John Davey (Cornish speaker)|John Davey]] junior (d. 1891) and senior, of Boswednack; Anne Berryman (1766–1854), also of Boswednack.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rod Lyon]], Cornish – The Struggle for Survival, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Legend-Dolly-Pentreath-outlived-native-tongue/story-13069391-detail/story.html |title=Legend of Dolly Pentreath outlived her native tongue |publisher=This is Cornwall |date=2011-08-04 |accessdate=2014-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207201058/http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Legend-Dolly-Pentreath-outlived-native-tongue/story-13069391-detail/story.html |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthias Wallis of [[St.&amp;nbsp;Buryan]] certified in 1859 that his grandmother, Ann Wallis, who had died around 1844, had spoken Cornish well. He also stated that a Jane Barnicoate, who had died about 1857, could speak Cornish too.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan M. Kent]], [[Tim Saunders]], ''Looking at the Mermaid: A Reader in Cornish Literature 900–1900'', Francis Boutle, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3954">In [[linguistics]], the '''empty category principle''' ('''ECP''') was proposed in [[Noam Chomsky]]'s syntactic framework of [[government and binding theory]]. The ECP is supposed to be a universal syntactic constraint that requires certain types of [[Empty category|empty categories]], namely [[trace (linguistics)|trace]]s, to be properly [[government (linguistics)|governed]].

ECP is a principle of [[transformational grammar]] by which traces must be visible, i.e. they must be identifiable as empty positions in the surface structure, similar to the principle of reconstruction for [[deletion (grammar)|deletion]]. Thus an empty category is in a position [[subcategorization|subcategorized]] for by a verb. In government and binding theory this is known as ''proper government''. Proper government occurs either if the empty position is governed by a [[lexical category]] (especially if it is not a subject) (theta-government) or if it is coindexed with a [[maximal projection]] which governs it (antecedent-government). The ECP has been revised many times and is now a central part of government and binding theory.&lt;ref&gt;Hadumod Bussmann, ''Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics''&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of its name, the ECP applies to only two of the four types of empty category. The chief function of the ECP is to place constraints on the movement of categories by the rule of [[move α]]; it effectively allows a tree structure to "remember" what has happened at earlier stages of a derivation, and it can be seen as GB's version of the older derivational constraints.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. L. Trask]], ''A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics''&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, the ECP states that:
*Traces must be properly governed:
**A properly governs B iff A theta-governs B or A antecedent-governs B
***A theta-governs B iff A governs B and A [[theta role|theta]]-marks B
***A antecedent-governs B iff A governs B and A is coindexed with B.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Luraghi and Claudia Parodi, ''Key Terms in Syntax and Syntactic Theory''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECP is a way of accounting for, among other things, the empirical fact that it is generally more difficult to move up a [[wh-movement|''wh''-word]] from a subject position than from an object position.

The intermediate [[trace (linguistics)|trace]]s must be deleted because they cannot be properly governed; theta-government is impossible because of the position they occupy, Spec-CP; the only possible antecedent-governor might be an overt NP (a wh-word), but the Minimality Condition would always be violated because of the tensed I (which must be present in all [[matrix clause]]s), the tensed I would [[c-command]] the intermediate trace but it would not c-command the wh-word. So we have to say that intermediate traces must be deleted at [[logical form]] so that they can avoid the ECP.

In the case of ''object extraction'' (the trace is a complement of VP), theta-government is the only possible option. In the case of subject extraction (the trace in Spec-IP), antecedent-government is the only possible option.

If the trace is in Spec-IP and we have an overt [[complementizer]] (such as ''that''), the sentence is ungrammatical because the ECP is violated. The closest potential governor would be the complementizer, which cannot antecedent-govern the trace because it is not coindexed with it (and theta-government is impossible since trace is in Spec-IP).

For example, in the sentence ''Who do you think (that) John will invite?'' the ECP works in the following way (the structure is given for the embedded clause only):

'''''Enfant terrible''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɒ̃|f|ɒ̃|_|t|ɛ|ˈ|r|iː|b|l|ə}}; {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃fɑ̃ tɛʁibl|lang}}; "unruly child") is a [[French language|French]] expression, traditionally referring to a child who is terrifyingly candid by saying embarrassing things to parents or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/enfant%20terrible|title=enfant terrible|publisher=dictionary.reverso.net|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/definition/enfant%20terrible|title=enfant terrible|publisher=www.wordreference.com|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the expression has drawn multiple usage in careers of [[art]], [[fashion]], [[music]], and other [[creative arts]]. In these careers, it implies a successful "genius" who is very unorthodox, striking, and in some cases, offensive, or rebellious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translation.babylon.com/english/enfant%20terrible/|title=enfant terrible|publisher=translation.babylon.com|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition, gives the definition: "A child who embarrasses his elders by untimely remarks; transf. a person who compromises his associates or his party by unorthodox or ill-considered speech or behaviour; loosely, one who acts unconventionally."

''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' also defines an ''enfant terrible'' as an unusually successful person who is strikingly unorthodox, innovative, and/or [[avant-garde]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1738">'''Erika Liebman''' (1738&amp;ndash;1803) was a Swedish poet and academic. She was likely the first woman student{{citation-needed|date=January 2015}} at [[Lund University|Lunds universitet]].

She was the daughter of professor [[Reinhold Liebman]]&lt;ref name=Runeberg&gt;{{cite web|title=Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor|url=http://runeberg.org/sqvinnor/0265.html|website=Project Runeberg|publisher=Project Runeberg|accessdate=3 January 2015|ref=Runeberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Lund university and was allowed to attend class. She would thereby be counted as the first woman to have studied at a Swedish university. She continued her studies as an adult, which aroused great attention because of her gender.

In November 1756, she was published in Latin in [[Svenska Merkurius]]:

&lt;poem style="border:2px solid #d6d2c5;background-color: #f9f4e6;padding: 0.5em; width:80%"&gt;
''Egregias, Scharffi, virtutes optime tractas,
Et quæris genii spargere dona tui.
Ipsa tuos laudo conatus; grator et opto,
Istud quod tractas, sedulitate probes.''
&lt;/poem&gt;

She married the vicar Magnus Sommar in [[Ingelstorp]] in 1761.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2086">In [[telephony]], '''GoTa''' or “Global Open Trunking Architecture” is a [[CDMA]]-based [[Trunked radio systems|digital trunking system]]. The GoTA system was developed by [[ZTE]], a Chinese manufacturer. It was approved as a [[China Communications Standards Association|CCSA]] standard&lt;ref name=GOTA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsa.org.cn/english/show_article.php?article_id=cyzx_eeac409a-f7f1-cd66-a21d-4dede51d29e5 |title=YDT 1838-2008 Technical Requirements of Air Interface for the CDMA-based Digital Trunking Mobile Communication System|accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by the China Ministry of Industry  and Information Technology in 2008 and accepted as an international standard by the [[ITU]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="tel"&gt;[http://www.telecoms.com/55319/zte%E2%80%99s-gota-accepted-by-itu-report/ ZTE’s GoTa Accepted by ITU Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The GoTA system can be used for both private and public trunking network applications.

GoTa is capable of providing a variety of [[trunking]] services: 
*One-to-one private calls and one-to-many group calls
*The ability to set the user’s priority
*The ability to perform forced insertion/forced release based on the user’s priority
*The ability to provide special services such as system paging, group paging, sub-group paging, and dedicated [[Push to talk|Push-To-Talk]] services as required
*The ability to classify the groups into permanent and temporary groups, in which the group members can be managed by the user.

In addition to trunking service, GoTa can provide value-added services such as short messages, location-based services and other data services. The original GoTa standard was developed for the [[CDMA frequency bands|800 MHz]] band. GoTa is adapted to work in the 450&amp;nbsp;MHz band as well.

==Notes==
PTT PoC or [[Push to talk]] over Cellular is a feature similar to [[walkie-talkie]] that is provided over a cellular phone network.

'''Gourmanchéma''' (Goulmacema, Gourma, Gourmantche, Gulimancema, Gulmancema, Gurma) is a major [[language]] of the [[Gurma people]] spoken in [[Burkina Faso]], northern [[Togo]] and [[Benin]], and [[Niger]].

All [[noun]]s in the language are classified into eight classes, identified by their [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es in both singular and plural.  All [[mass noun]]s, states of existence, languages, for example, begin with the prefix ''mi-'' and end with the suffix ''-ma'' (that is, they take the [[circumfix]] ''mi—ma''), as in blood (''misuama''), water (''minyima''), sand (''mitambima''), fire (''mifantama''), existence (''miyema''), state of being crazy (''migadima''), Gourmantché language (''migourmantchema''). All trees have a set of circumfixes ''bu—bu'' and ''i—di'' in the singular and plural, as in ''busaabu'' (shea tree) and ''isaandi'' (shea trees).

शीतलता भी अब तन-मन में;
ना जाने क्यों झुलसाती है।
शाम ढले परछाई हमसे;
चुपके-चुपके बतियाती है।
झील लगे जंगल में जैसे;
पायलिया-सी खनकाती है।
तपते मन पर आँख की बदली;
शीतल आँसू बरसाती है।
कोयल चुप ही रहती है या;
गीत खुशी के ही गाती है।
बीच भँवर में हिम्मत हमको;
जीवन जीना सिखलाती है।
चाक किया जाना है सीना;
धरती फिर भी मुसकाती है।
पी सकता है विष ये 'अग्रहरि' ही;
फौलादी उसकी छाती है।।

Ikizu (''Ikikizu, Kiikiizo'') is a [[Bantu language]] spoken by the [[Ikizu people]]s of Tanzania. Dialects are Ikizu proper and Sizaki. Maho (2009) treats Sizaki (Shashi) as a separate language. However, ''Ethnologue'' 16 retired the ISO code for Sizaki, merging it into Ikizu.

== Orthography ==

Ikuzu uses the [[Latin alphabet]]. It does not include the letters ''Q'', ''V'', or ''X''. The letters ''B'' and ''C'' are only used in the forms ''Bh'' and ''Ch''.

'''Intercultural communication''' (or [[cross-cultural communication|'''cross-cultural communication''']]) is a discipline that studies [[communication]] across different [[culture]]s and [[social group]]s, or how culture affects communication. It describes the wide range of communication processes and problems that naturally appear within an organization or social context made up of individuals from different religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. In this sense it seeks to understand how people from different countries and cultures act, communicate and [[perception|perceive]] the world around them. Many people in intercultural business communication argue that culture determines how individuals encode messages, what medium they choose for transmitting them, and the way messages are interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauring|first=Jakob|title=Intercultural Organizational Communication: The Social Organizing of Interaction in International Encounters|journal=Journal of Business and Communication|year=2011|volume=48 |issue=3|pages=231–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
With regard to intercultural communication proper, it studies situations where people from different cultural backgrounds ''interact''. Aside from language, intercultural communication focuses on social attributes, thought patterns, and the cultures of different groups of people. It also involves understanding the different cultures, languages and customs of people from other countries. Intercultural communication plays a role in [[social science]]s such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[communication studies]]. Intercultural communication is also referred to as the base for international businesses. Several cross-cultural service providers assist with the development of intercultural communication skills. Research is a major part of the development of intercultural communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://communication-design.net/3-tips-for-effective-global-communication// | title=3 Tips For Effective Global Communication | date=April 9, 2010 | author=Drary, Tom | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413232213/http://communication-design.net/3-tips-for-effective-global-communication// | archivedate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/intercultural-communication// |title=Intercultural Communication Law &amp; Legal Definition |publisher=Definitions.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity and culture are also studied within the discipline of communication to analyze how globalization influences ways of thinking, beliefs, values, and identity, within and between cultural environments. Intercultural communication scholars approach theory with a dynamic outlook and do not believe culture can be measured nor that cultures share universal attributes. Scholars acknowledge that culture and communication shift along with societal changes and theories should consider the constant shifting and nuances of society.

The study of intercultural communication requires intercultural understanding, which is an ability to understand and value cultural differences. Language is an example of an important cultural component that is linked to intercultural understanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Saint-Jacques, Bernard. 2011. “Intercultural Communication in a Globalized World.” In Intercultural Communication: A Reader, edited by Larry A. Samovar, Richard E. Porter, and Edwin R. McDaniel, 13 edition, 45-53. Boston, Mass: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intercultural communication'' is in a way the 'interaction with speakers of other languages on equal terms and respecting their identities'.&lt;ref&gt;Byram, Gribkova &amp; Starkey, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of interest ==

=== Cross-cultural business communication ===
Cross-cultural business communication is very helpful in building cultural intelligence through coaching and training in cross-cultural communication management and facilitation, cross-cultural negotiation, multicultural conflict resolution, customer service, business and organizational communication. Cross-cultural understanding is not just for incoming expats. Cross-cultural understanding begins with those responsible for the project and reaches those delivering the service or content.  The ability to communicate, negotiate and effectively work with people from other cultures is vital to international business.

====Management====
Important points to consider:

* Develop cultural sensitivity
* Anticipate the meaning the receiver will get.
* Careful encoding
* Use words, pictures, and gestures.
* Avoid slang, idioms, regional sayings.
* Selective transmission 
* Build relationships, face-to-face if possible.
* Careful decoding of feedback
* Get feedback from multiple parties.
* Improve listening and observation skills.
* Follow-up actions

====Facilitation====
There is a connection between a person's personality traits and the ability to adapt to the host-country's environment—including the ability to communicate within that environment.

Two key personality traits are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extrovertedness, and open-mindedness. Resilience includes having an internal locus of control, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness.

These factors, combined with the person's cultural and racial identity and level of preparedness for change, comprise that person's potential for adaptation.

=== Cultural&amp;nbsp;perceptions ===
There are common conceptualizations of attributes that define [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] and [[Individualism|individualistic]] cultures. Operationalizing the perceptions of cultural identities works under the guise that cultures are static and homogeneous, when in fact cultures within nations are multi-ethnic and individuals show high variation in how cultural differences are internalized and expressed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
[[Globalization]] plays a central role in theorizing for mass communication, media, and cultural communication studies.&lt;ref&gt;Crofts Wiley, Stephen B. 2004. “Rethinking Nationality in the Context of Globalization.” Communication Theory 14 (1):78–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Intercultural communication scholars emphasize that globalization emerged from the increasing diversity of cultures throughout the world and thrives with the removal of cultural barriers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The notion of nationality, or the construction of national space, is understood to emerge dialectically through communication and globalization.

The Intercultural Praxis Model by Kathryn Sorrells, PH.D shows us how to navigate through the complexities of cultural differences along with power differences. This model will help you understand who you are as an individual, and how you can better communicate with others that may be different from you. In order to continue living in a globalized society one can use this Praxis model to understand cultural differences (based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, etc.) within the institutional and historical systems of power. Intercultural Communication Praxis Model requires us to respond to someone who comes from a different culture than us, in the most open way we can. The media are influential in what we think of other cultures and also what we think about our own selves. However it is important, we educate ourselves, and learn how to communicate with others through Sorrells Praxis Model.[https://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/field_download/page/Difficult%20Dialogues%20Learning%20Activity%20-%20Kathryn%20Sorrells.pdf]

== Problems ==
The problems in intercultural communication usually come from problems in message transmission and in reception. In communication between people of the same culture, the person who receives the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the person who sent the message. When this happens, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is likely to be fairly similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the receiver of the message is a person from a different culture, the receiver uses information from his or her culture to interpret the message. The message that the receiver interprets may be very different from what the speaker intended.

Nonverbal communication has been shown to account for between 65% and 93% of interpreted communication.&lt;ref name="Samovar Larry 2006. pp13"&gt;Samovar Larry, Porter Richard, McDaniel Edwin, Roy Carolyn. 2006. Intercultural Communication A Reader. Nonverbal Communication. pp13.&lt;/ref&gt; Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause mistrust and misperception of the situation among cross-cultural parties. This is where nonverbal communication can cause problems with intercultural communication. Misunderstandings with nonverbal communication can lead to miscommunication and insults with cultural differences. For example, a handshake in one culture may be recognized as appropriate, whereas another culture may recognize it as rude or inappropriate.&lt;ref name="Samovar Larry 2006. pp13" /&gt;

Effective communication depends on the informal understandings among the parties involved that are based on the trust developed between them. When trust exists, there is implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated vary across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity to be trusting than others.

==Theories==
The following types of theories can be distinguished in different strands: focus on effective outcomes, on accommodation or adaption, on [[identity negotiation]] and management, on [[communication network]]s,on [[acculturation]] and [[Adjustment disorder|adjustment]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gudykunst 2003 for an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social engineering effective outcomes ===
*Cultural convergence
**In a relatively closed social system in which communication among members is unrestricted, the system as a whole will tend to ''converge'' over time toward a state of greater cultural ''uniformity''. The system will tend to diverge toward diversity when communication is restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid, D. L. (1988). The convergence theory of intercultural communication. In Y. Y. Kim &amp; W. B. Gudykunst (Eds.), Theories in intercultural communication (pp. 280–298). Newbury Park, CA: Sage. p.289&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Communication accommodation theory]]
**This theory focuses on linguistic strategies to decrease or increase communicative distances.Communication accommodation theory seeks to explain and predict why, when, and how people adjust their communicative behavior during social interaction, and what social consequences result from these adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1002/9781118540190.wbeic006|chapter=Communication Accommodation Theory|title=The International Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Communication|pages=1–21|year=2015|last1=Dragojevic|first1=Marko|last2=Gasiorek|first2=Jessica|last3=Giles|first3=Howard|isbn=9781118540190|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/306556/files/2007_gilesogay_cat.pdf|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Intercultural adaption
**Intercultural adaptation involves learned communicative competence. Communicative competence is defined as thinking, feeling, and pragmatically behaving in ways defined as appropriate by the dominant mainstream culture. Communication competence is an outcomes based measure conceptualized as functional/operational conformity to environmental criteria such as working conditions. Beyond this, adaptation means "the need to conform" to mainstream "objective reality" and "accepted modes of experience".&lt;ref name="Gudykunst, W. 2003"&gt;Gudykunst, W. &amp; Kim, Y. Y. (2003). Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication, 4th ed., 378. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  
*[[Co-cultural communication theory|Co-cultural theory]]
**In its most general form, co-cultural communication refers to interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members.&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Co-cultures include but are not limited to people of color, women, people with disabilities, gay men and lesbians, and those in the lower social classes. Co-cultural theory, as developed by Mark P. Orbe, looks at the strategic ways in which co-cultural group members communicate with others. In addition, a co-cultural framework provides an explanation for how different persons communicate based on six factors.

===Identity negotiation or management===
*[[Identity management theory]]
*[[Identity negotiation]]
*Cultural identity theory
*[[Double-swing model]]

=== Communication networks ===
*Networks and outgroup communication competence
*[[Intracultural]] versus intercultural networks
*Networks and acculturation

=== Acculturation and adjustment ===
*Communication acculturation
**This theory attempts to portray "cross-cultural adaptation as a collaborative effort in which a stranger and the receiving environment are engaged in a joint effort."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Y.Y.(1995), p.192&lt;/ref&gt;
*Anxiety/Uncertainty management
**When strangers communicate with hosts, they experience uncertainty and anxiety. Strangers need to manage their uncertainty as well as their anxiety in order to be able to communicate effectively with hosts and then to try to develop accurate predictions and explanations for hosts' behaviors.
*[[Cultural assimilation|Assimilation]], [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]] states
**Assimilation and adaption are not permanent outcomes of the adaption process; rather, they are temporary outcomes of the communication process between hosts and immigrants. "Alienation or assimilation, therefore, of a group or an individual, is an outcome of the relationship between deviant behavior and neglectful communication."&lt;ref&gt;Mc.Guire and Mc.Dermott, 1988, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;
*Assimilation
** Assimilation is the process of absorbing the traits of the dominant culture to the point where the group that was assimilated becomes indistinguishable from the host culture. Assimilation can be either forced or done voluntarily depending on situations and conditions. Regardless of the situation or the condition it is very rare to see a minority group replace and or even forget their previous cultural practices.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pauls|first1=Elizabeth|title=Assimilation|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/assimilation-society|website=www.britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alienation
** Alienation  frequently refers to someone who is ostracized or withdrawn from other people with whom they would ordinarily be expected to associate with. Hajda, a representative theorist and researcher of social alienation says: " alienation is an individuals feeling of uneasiness or discomfort which reflects his exclusion or self-exclusion from social and cultural participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Giffin|first1=Kim|title=Social alienation by communicaton denial|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=56|issue=4|pages=347–357|doi=10.1080/00335637009383022|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
* [[Meaning of meanings theory]] – "A misunderstanding takes place when people assume a word has a direct connection with its referent. A common past reduces misunderstanding. Definition, metaphor, feedforward, and Basic English are partial linguistic remedies for a lack of shared experience."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Face negotiation theory]] – "Members of collectivistic, high-context cultures have concerns for mutual face and inclusion that lead them to manage conflict with another person by avoiding, obliging, or compromising. Because of concerns for self-face and autonomy, people from individualistic, low-context cultures manage conflict by dominating or through problem solving"&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Standpoint theory]] – An individual's experiences, knowledge, and communication behaviors are shaped in large part by the social groups to which they belong. Individuals sometimes view things similarly, but other times have very different views in which they see the world. The ways in which they view the world are shaped by the experiences they have and through the social group they identify themselves to be a part of.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social group]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, P. H. (1990). Black feminist thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment. Boston: Unwin Hyman.&lt;/ref&gt; "Feminist standpoint theory claims that the social groups to which we belong shape what we know and how we communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 2005 {{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory is derived from the Marxist position that economically oppressed classes can access knowledge unavailable to the socially privileged and can generate distinctive accounts, particularly knowledge about social relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B00DG8M7EU | title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice | publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc | year=2013 | isbn=978-1412927444 | edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stranger theory]] – At least one of the persons in an intercultural encounter is a stranger.  Strangers are a 'hyperaware' of cultural differences and tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individual distinctions.
* [[Feminist genre theory]] – Evaluates communication by identifying feminist speakers and reframing their speaking qualities as models for women's liberation.
* [[Genderlect theory]] – "Male-female conversation is cross-cultural communication. Masculine and feminine styles of discourse are best viewed as two distinct cultural dialects rather than as inferior or superior ways of speaking. Men's report talk focuses on status and independence. Women's support talk seeks human connection."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cultural critical studies theory]] – The theory states that the mass media impose the dominant ideology on the rest of society, and the connotations of words and images are fragments of ideology that perform an unwitting service for the ruling elite.
* [[Marxism]] – aims to explain class struggle and the basis of social relations through economics.

==History of assimilation==
* Forced assimilation was very common in the European colonial empires the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Colonial policies regarding religion conversion, the removal of children, the division of community property, and the shifting of gender roles primarily impacted North and South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia. 
Voluntary assimilation has also been a part of history dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 14th and 15th centuries, when many Muslims and Jews voluntarily converted to Roman Catholicism as a response to religious prosecution while secretly continuing their original practices. Another example is when the Europeans moved to the United States.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"/&gt;

== Intercultural competence ==

Intercultural communication is competent when it accomplishes the objectives in a manner that is appropriate to the context and relationship. Intercultural communication thus needs to bridge the dichotomy between appropriateness and effectiveness:&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt; Proper means of intercultural communication leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Facts and Figures| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Appropriateness:''' Valued rules, norms, and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly.
*'''Effectiveness:''' Valued goals or rewards (relative to costs and alternatives) are accomplished.

'''Competent communication''' is an interaction that is seen as effective in achieving certain rewarding objectives in a way that is also related to the context in which the situation occurs. In other words, it is a conversation with an achievable goal that is used at an appropriate time/location.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"&gt;(Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===

Intercultural communication can be linked with identity, which means the competent communicator is the person who can affirm others' avowed identities. As well as goal attainment is also a focus within intercultural competence and it involves the communicator to convey a sense of communication appropriateness and effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

Ethnocentrism plays a role in intercultural communication. The capacity to avoid ethnocentrism is the foundation of intercultural communication competence. Ethnocentrism is the inclination to view one's own group as natural and correct, and all others as aberrant.

People must be aware that to engage and fix intercultural communication there is no easy solution and there is not only one way to do so. Listed below are some of the components of intercultural competence.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

* Context: A judgment that a person is competent is made in both a relational and situational context.This means that competence is not defined as a single attribute, meaning someone could be very strong in one section and only moderately good in another. Situationally speaking competence can be defined differently for different cultures. For example, eye contact shows competence in western cultures whereas, Asian cultures find too much eye contact disrespectful.
* Appropriateness: This means that one's behaviours are acceptable and proper for the expectations of any given culture.
* Effectiveness: The behaviours that lead to the desired outcome being achieved.
* Motivations:This has to do with emotional associations as they communicate interculturally. Feelings which are one's reactions to thoughts and experiences have to do with motivation. Intentions are thoughts that guide one's choices, it is a goal or plan that directs one's behaviour. These two things play a part in motivation.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

=== Basic tools for improvement ===

The following are ways to improve communication competence:
* Display of interest: showing respect and positive regard for the other person.
* Orientation to knowledge: Terms people use to explain themselves  and their perception of the world.
* Empathy:  Behaving in ways that shows one understands the point of view of others
* Task role behaviour: initiate ideas that encourage problem solving activities.
* Relational role behaviour: interpersonal harmony and mediation.
* Tolerance for unknown and ambiguity: The ability to react to new situations with little discomfort.
* Interaction posture: Responding to others in descriptive, non-judgmental ways.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;
* Patience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geldart|first1=Phil|title=Excellent Communication Requires Patience|url=https://www.eaglesflight.com/blog/bid/153152/Excellent-Communication-Requires-Patience|website=eaglesflight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Active listening&lt;ref name="linguasoftech.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Importance of Communication Skills at Work Place|url=https://www.linguasoftech.com/blog/importance-of-communication-skills-at-work-place/|website=linguasofttech|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clarity  &lt;ref name="linguasoftech.com"/&gt;

=== Important factors===

* Proficiency in the host culture language: understanding the grammar and vocabulary.
* Understanding language pragmatics: how to use politeness strategies in making requests and how to avoid giving out too much information.
* Being sensitive and aware to nonverbal communication patterns in other cultures.
* Being aware of gestures that may be offensive or mean something different in a host culture rather than one's own culture.
* Understanding a culture's proximity in physical space and paralinguistic sounds to convey their intended meaning.&lt;ref name="Intercultural Communication"&gt;(Intercultural Communication)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traits ===

* Flexibility.
* Tolerating high levels of uncertainty.
* Self-reflection.
* Open-mindedness.
* Sensitivity.
* Adaptability.
* "[[Thinking outside the box]]" and [[lateral thinking]]&lt;ref name="Intercultural Communication"/&gt;

==Verbal communication==
Verbal communication consist of messages being sent and received continuously with the speaker and the listener, it is focused on the way messages are portrayed. Verbal communication is based on language and use of expression, the tone in which the sender of the message relays the communication can determine how the message is received and in what context.

'''Factors that affect verbal communication:'''

* Tone of voice
* Use of descriptive words
* Emphasis on certain phrases
* Volume of voice

The way a message is received is dependent on these factors as they give a greater interpretation for the receiver as to what is meant by the message. By emphasizing a certain phrase with the tone of voice, this indicates that it is important and should be focused more on.

Along with these attributes, verbal communication is also accompanied with non-verbal cues. These cues make the message clearer and give the listener an indication of what way the information should be received.&lt;ref&gt;Hinde, R. A. (1972). Non-verbal communication; edited by R. A. Hinde. -. Cambridge [Eng.]: University Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example of non-verbal cues'''

* Facial expressions
* Hand gestures
* Use of objects
* Body movement

In terms of intercultural communication there are language barriers which are effected by verbal forms of communication. In this instance there is opportunity for miscommunication between two or more parties.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, A. (2007). Verbal and nonverbal communication behaviours [electronic resource] : COST Action 2102 International Workshop, Vietri sul Mare, Italy, March 29–31, 2007 : revised selected and invited papers / Anna Esposito ... [et al.] (eds.). Berlin ; New York : Springer, c2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other barriers that contribute to miscommunication would be the type of words chosen in conversation. Due to different cultures there are different meaning in vocabulary chosen, this allows for a message between the sender and receiver to be misconstrued.&lt;ref&gt;Scollon, R., &amp; Scollon, S. K. (2001). Intercultural communication : a discourse approach / Ron Scollon and Suzanne Wong Scollon. Malden, MA : Blackwell Publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nonverbal communication ==
Nonverbal communication is behavior that communicates without words—though it often may be accompanied by words. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause differing interpretations of the situation among cross-cultural parties.

Kinesic behavior is communication through body movement—e.g., posture, gestures, facial expressions and eye contact. The meaning of such behavior varies across countries.

Occulesics are a form of kinesics that includes eye contact and the use of the eyes to convey messages.

[[Proxemics]] concern the influence of proximity and space on communication (e.g., in terms of personal space and in terms of office layout). For example, space communicates power in the US and Germany.

[[Paralanguage]] refers to how something is said, rather than the content of what is said—e.g., rate of speech, tone and inflection of voice, other noises, laughing, yawning, and silence.

Object language or material culture refers to how people communicate through material artifacts—e.g., architecture, office design and furniture, clothing, cars, cosmetics, and time. In monochronic cultures, time is experienced linearly and as something to be spent, saved, made up, or wasted. Time orders life, and people tend to concentrate on one thing at a time. In polychronic cultures, people tolerate many things happening simultaneously and emphasize involvement with people. In these cultures, people may be highly distractible, focus on several things at once, and change plans often.

Clothing and the way people dress is used as a form of nonverbal communication.

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavours to bring together such relatively unrelated areas as [[cultural anthropology]] and established areas of communication. Its core is to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication, as with many scholarly fields, is a combination of many other fields. These fields include [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as “an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context”.&lt;ref name="Rymes"&gt;Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|8}} A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|11,12}}

'''Jafar Shahidi''' known as '''Seyed Jafar Shahidi''' ({{lang-fa|سیدجعفر شهیدی}}) (March 21, 1919 in [[Borujerd]], [[Iran]] – January 13, 2008 in [[Tehran]]) was a distinguished scholar of the [[Persian language]] and [[literature]] and a renowned [[History of Islam|historian of Islam]]. Born in Boroujerd, Iran, Shahidi dedicated his life to Persian studies, acting as the director of the Dehkhoda Dictionary Institute and International Centre for Persian language, serving as the Dean of the Faculty of Literature and Humanities at the [[University of Tehran]] (UT) and mastering the fields of jurisprudence and Islamic history. As a member of the Faculty of Literature and Humanities at the [[University of Tehran]], Shahidi specialized in the study of Persian language and literature as well as Islamic theology, jurisprudence, and history.

Shahidi was a prominent disciple of [[Ali Akbar Dehkhoda]] and [[Badiozzaman Forouzanfar]]. He served as a seminary in Qom and Najaf under notable figures such as Tabatabaei, Seyed Hossein Boroujerdi, S. Khoi A. under whom he attained his degree in ijtihad. He is most notable for his works on the [[Dehkhoda]] encyclopedic dictionary of the Persian language and his research in Islamic history and religion.

In his later years, he served as the President of the [[Dehkhoda Institute]] and founder of the International Center for Persian Studies.

==Life and Legacy==
Seyed Jafar Shahidi was born in the town of [[Boroujerd]], [[Iran]]. His father, Mohammad Sajjadi was a leading Iranian scholar who died shortly after the birth of his son. Spending the first few years of his education in his hometown, Shahidi continued his academics in the capital city of [[Tehran]].

In 1941, he moved to the town of [[Najaf]], [[Iraq]] to pursue his studies in the field of Islamic jurisprudence and successfully surpassed the highest levels of education to receive the title of [[mujtahid]]. From there onward, Shahidi moved to [[Qom]], [[Iran]] where he was mentored by the leading scholars, most notably  Ayatollah Boroujerdi. Falling ill, Shahidi resorted to the translation of Arabic in Iran alongside Doctor Sanjabi (the then Minister of Culture). He later received an offer to teach at the Abu Muslem school.

Encounters with Dr. [[Mohammad Moin]] permitted his close relationship with Ali Akbar Dehkhoda who later entrusted Shahidi as the director of the Dehkhoda Institute. In a letter to the then Minister of Culture, [[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]] wrote, "Shahidi is rare in his abilities as a scholar," noting that he wished to limit his hours at the institute from twenty-two to eight in order for Shahidi to be able to continue his teachings as well.

Dr. Shahidi played a pivotal role in the formation and compilation of the second largest Persian lexicon, known as the [[Moeen Encyclopedia]]. Shahidi was entrusted with the completion and publishing of the text upon Dr. [[Mohammad Moin]]'s death in 1971.

In 1991, Dr. Shahidi donated his residential house to the [[Narmak]] Municipality of [[Tehran]] where it remains today as the Dr. Shahidi Public Library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1207">'''''Kreegah bundolo''''' is a phrase that [[Tarzan]]—and the tribe of apes that raised him—cry out to warn of danger, for example, "Kreegah bundolo!  White men come with hunt sticks.  Kill!" According to the [[Mangani|fictional ape language]] worked out by Tarzan creator [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the literal translation of the phrase would be "Beware, (I) kill!"

"Kreegah Bundola" is one of a few names for the [[Frank Zappa]] song whose most popular title seems to be "Let's Move to Cleveland". It is also utilized in [[Bruce Coville]]'s "Allbright" series as Grakker's "violence" module boot-up sound byte. It was uttered by a hunger-crazed [[Fat Freddy]] in an episode of ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]''.

In Portuguese, "Kreegah bundolo" was translated as "''Krig-Ha, Bandolo!''" and it names an [[Krig-Há, Bandolo!|album]] by the Brazilian rocker [[Raul Seixas]].

In the comic strip [[Dilbert]] dated 2/7/1995, [[Dogbert]] uses this phrase in speaking with Dilbert after he has been home telecommuting too long.&lt;ref&gt;http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/1995-02-07/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''missing person''' is a person who has disappeared and whose status as alive or dead cannot be confirmed as his or her location and fate are not known.

A person may go missing through a voluntary disappearance, or else due to an accident, crime, death in a location where they cannot be found (such as at sea), or many other reasons. In most parts of the world, a missing person will usually be found quickly. While criminal abductions are some of the most widely reported missing person cases, these account for only 2–5% of missing children in Europe.

By contrast, some missing person cases remain unresolved for many years.&lt;!-- STATS NEEDED:- "Worldwide X people go missing each year" or something. --&gt; Laws related to these cases are often complex since, in many jurisdictions, relatives and third parties may not deal with a person's assets until their death is considered proven by law and a formal [[death certificate]] issued. The situation, uncertainties, and lack of [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] or a [[funeral]] resulting when a person goes missing may be extremely painful with long-lasting effects on family and friends.

A number of organizations seek to connect, share best practices, and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations, including the [[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] (ICMEC), as well as national centers, including the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] in the US, [[Missing People]] in the UK, [[Child Focus]] in Belgium, and [[The Smile of the Child]] in Greece.

== Reasons ==
People disappear for many reasons. Some individuals choose to disappear alone. Reasons for non-identification may include:

* To escape domestic abuse by a parent(s)/guardian(s)/sibling(s)/spouse.
* Leaving home to live somewhere else under a new identity.
* Becoming the victim of [[kidnapping]].
* [[Child abduction|Abduction]] (of a minor) by a non-custodial parent or other relative.
* Seizure by government officials without [[due process|due process of law]] (see [[forced disappearance]]).
* [[Suicide]] in a remote location or under an [[pseudonym|assumed name]] (to spare their families the suicide at home or to allow their deaths to be eventually [[declared death in absentia|declared ''in absentia'']]).
* Victim of [[murder]] (body disguised, destroyed, or hidden).
* [[Mental disorder|Mental illness]] or other ailments such as [[Alzheimer's Disease]] can cause someone to become lost or they may not know how to identify themselves due to long-term memory loss that causes them to forget where they live, the identity of family members or relatives, or their own names.
* Death by [[natural causes]] (disease) or accident far from home without identification.
* Disappearance to take advantage of better employment or living conditions elsewhere.
* Sold into slavery, serfdom, sexual servitude, or other [[unfree labor]].
* To avoid discovery of a crime or apprehension by law-enforcement authorities. (''See also'' [[failure to appear]].)
* Joining a [[cult]] or other religious organization that requires no contact to the outside world.  
* To avoid [[war]] or persecution during a [[genocide]].
* To escape famine or natural disaster.
* Death by floods, flash floods, debris flows, hurricanes, tsunamis and tornadoes.
* Death in the water, with no body recovered.

== Categories of missing children ==
* '''Runaways''' (national / international): Minors who run away from home, from the institution where they have been placed, or from the people responsible for their care.
* '''Abduction by a third person''': Abduction of minors by anyone other than the parents or the persons with parental authority.
* '''National or international parental abduction''': Parental abductions are cases where a child is taken to or kept in a country or place other than that of his/her normal residence by one or more parents or persons with parental authority, against another parent's will or against the will of the person with parental authority.
* '''Missing unaccompanied migrant minors''': Disappearances of migrant children, nationals of a country in which there is no free movement of persons, under the age of 18 who have been separated from both parents and are not being cared for by an adult, who by law is responsible for doing so.
* '''Lost, injured or otherwise missing children''': Disappearances for no apparent reason of minors who got lost (e.g. young children at the seaside in summer) or hurt themselves and cannot be found immediately (e.g. accidents during sport activities, at youth camps, etc.), as well as children whose reason for disappearing has not yet been determined.

== Legal aspects ==
A [[List of common misconceptions|common misconception]] is that a person must be absent for at least 24 hours before being legally classed as missing, but this is rarely the case. Law enforcement agencies often stress that the case should be reported as early as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Missing persons usually found|author1=Preston Sparks|author2=Timothy Cox|lastauthoramp=yes|date=November 17, 2008|newspaper=[[Augusta Chronicle]]|accessdate=May 21, 2011|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2008/11/17/met_483813.shtml|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214111833/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2008/11/17/met_483813.shtml|archivedate=December 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingpersons.gov.au/nmpcc/faqs.aspx#a1|title=FAQs: Question: Do you need to wait 24 hours before reporting a person missing?|publisher=National Missing Persons Coordination Center, [[Australian Federal Police]]|accessdate=May 22, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214111833/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2008/11/17/met_483813.shtml#a1|archivedate=December 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[common law]] jurisdictions a missing person can be [[Declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']] (or "legally dead") after seven years. This time frame may be reduced in certain cases, such as deaths in major battles or mass disasters such as the [[September 11 attacks]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Race  ==
There is often a racial disparity between a when a white person goes missing and when a black person goes missing.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seong-Jae|first=Min,|last2=C.|first2=Feaster, John|title=Missing Children in National News Coverage: Racial and Gender Representations of Missing Children Cases|url=https://www.academia.edu/857391/Missing_Children_in_National_News_Coverage_Racial_and_Gender_Representations_of_Missing_Children_Cases|journal=Communication Research Reports|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seong-Jae|first=Min,|last2=C.|first2=Feaster, John|title=Missing Children in National News Coverage: Racial and Gender Representations of Missing Children Cases|url=http://www.academia.edu/857391/Missing_Children_in_National_News_Coverage_Racial_and_Gender_Representations_of_Missing_Children_Cases|journal=Communication Research Reports|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person is considered missing by the police if they cannot be located and they did not  leave of their own will. According to authors Seong-Jae Min &amp; John C. Feaste, there has always been a history of the news favoring white individuals by providing them better news coverage than people of color. It is often that researchers find that African Americans are underrepresented in the media when missing&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Most missing persons cases in the news cover young Caucasian girls who as a result have a better chance of being found alive due to increased media attention.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, in 2002, when a young Caucasian girl from Utah named Elizabeth Smart went missing, the media broadcast was worldwide. According to John C Feaste, after several months of searching, she was found alive.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In comparison, when Alexis Patterson, a young black girl from Wisconsin went missing, she received no news coverage and is still missing to this day. In addition''',''' when women of color go missing, the tone used by the newscasters  is generally less empathetic and detailed than the compassionate language used when white women go missing.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2010.514110|title=“Newsworthy” Victims?|last=Gilchrist|first=Kristen|date=10 Dec 2010|website=Taylor and Francis Online|archive-date=10 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several organizations that bring awareness and equality to missing people of color, such as the Black and Missing Foundation. This a non'''-'''profit organization founded in 2008.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackandmissinginc.com/cdad/about.htm|title=Missing Black Children, Missing Black Adults, Report a Missing Person|website=www.blackandmissinginc.com|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black and Missing Foundation's goal is to provide resources for families of missing people of color and educate minorities on personal safety,  &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Additionally, Deidra Robey helms a non profit organization called Black and Missing but not Forgotten.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blackandmissing.org/volunteer/|title=Volunteer|work=Black and Missing {{!}} But Not Forgotten|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is a network that provides families a way to spread the news quickly that a loved one is missing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; To find a missing person you must know they are gone and without big media the chances of a person being found safe decreases drastically. The goal of these organization is to provide equal coverage for African Americans. Every human being deserves an equal chance at being found safe and sound and as a result these organizations are seeking to level the playing field.

==Searches==
In most countries, the [[police]] are the default agency for leading an investigation into a missing person case. Disappearances at sea are a general exception, as these require a specialized agency such as a [[coast guard]]. In many countries such as the United States, voluntary search and rescue teams can be called out to assist the police in the search. Rescue agencies such as [[fire department]]s, [[mountain rescue]] and [[cave rescue]] may also participate in cases that require their specialized resources.

Police forces such as [[Lancashire Constabulary]] stress the need to try to find the person quickly, to assess how vulnerable the person is and to search places that the person may have links to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lancashire.police.uk/faqs/missing-people/what-will-the-police-do-to-find-someone-who-is-reported-missing/|publisher=Lancashire Constabulary|title=What will the police do to find someone who is reported missing?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various charities exist to assist the investigations into unsolved cases. These include the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] in the US, [[Missing People]] in the UK, [[Child Focus]] in Belgium, and [[The Smile of the Child]] in Greece. Some missing person cases are given wide media coverage, with the searchers turning to the public for assistance. The persons' photographs may be displayed on bulletin boards, milk cartons, postcards, websites and social media to publicize their description.

As the findings from the 2002 Second [[National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway Children]] ([[NISMART]]–2) study summary by the US [[Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention]] (OJJDP) indicate, a child can be missing for many reasons, including "Nonfamily abductions", "Family abductions," "Runaway/thrownaway episodes," "Missing involuntary, lost, or injured events," and "Missing benign explanation situations."&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; NISMART–2 defined a missing child both with regard to children who were missing from their caretakers, and children who were missing from their caretakers and reported to an agency for assistance locating the missing children.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; NISMART–2 considered a child as missing "when the child experienced a qualifying episode during which the child's whereabouts were unknown to the primary caretaker, with the result that the caretaker was alarmed for at least 1 hour and tried to locate the child. For an episode to qualify, the child had to be younger than 18 and the situation had to meet the specific criteria for one of the [above] NISMART–2 episode types."&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; The study was based on data derived from four NISMART–2 studies – a Law Enforcement Study, National Household Surveys of both Adult Caretakers and Youth (using computer-aided telephone interviewing methodology), and a Juvenile Facilities Study.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edith Fairman Cooper (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_3ovmjODCUC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=NISMART+data+survey+adult+caretakers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rJXzVI7AJZLIsQTnjIGwBQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=NISMART%20data%20survey%20adult%20caretakers&amp;f=false ''Missing and Exploited Children: Overview and Policy Concerns; CRS report for Congress''], Nova Publishers, p. 4, {{ISBN|1-59033-815-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study summary noted that "it is important to recognize that nearly all of the caretaker missing children (1,312,800 or 99.8 percent) were returned home alive or located by the time the study data were collected. Only a fraction of a percent (0.2 percent or 2,500) of all caretaker missing children had not returned home or been located, and the vast majority of these were runaways from institutions ...."&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

==== Background and statistics ====
[[116 000]] is the European hotline for missing children active in 26 countries in the EU as well as Albania and Serbia. The hotline was an initiative pushed for by Missing Children Europe, the European federation for missing and sexually exploited children and realised through the European insititutions.

The Council of Europe estimates that about 1 in 5 children in Europe are victims of some form of sexual violence. In 70% to 85% of cases, the abuser is somebody the child knows and trusts. Child sexual violence can take many forms: sexual abuse within the family circle, child pornography and prostitution, corruption, solicitation via Internet and sexual assault by peers. In some of the cases, with no other available option, children flee their homes and care institutions, in search of a better and safer life.

Of the 50–60% of child runaways reported by the 116 000 European missing children hotline network, 1 in 6 are assumed to rough sleep on the run, 1 in 8 resort to stealing to survive and 1 in 4 children are at serious risk of some form of abuse. The number of rough sleeping children across Europe is on the rise. These runaways fall into vulnerable situations of [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], alcohol abuse and drug abuse leading to depression. Runaways are 9 times likelier to have suicidal tendencies than other children. The Children's Society published a report in 2011 on recommendations to the government to keep child runaways safe.
 
The issue of child disappearances is increasingly recognized as a concern for national and international policy makers especially in cross border abduction cases, organized child trafficking and child pornography as well as the transient nature of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum.

According to the UNHCR, over 15,000 unaccompanied and separated children claimed asylum in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland in 2009. The precarious situation of these children makes them particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses, rendering their protection critical, given the high risks to which they are exposed. Most of these children are boys aged 14 years and over, with diverse ethnic, cultural, religious and social backgrounds mainly originating from Afghanistan, Somalia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea and Iraq.

Among exploiters taking advantage of the children, are sometimes their own relatives who gain benefit in the form of social and/or family allowances. According to research done by Frontex, some types of threats faced by unaccompanied migrant minors include sexual exploitation in terms of pornography, prostitution and the internet; economic exploitation including forced donation of organs; criminal exploitation including drug smuggling and child trafficking including forced marriage and begging.

Criminal networks are heavily involved with human trafficking to the EU and this includes also exploitation of minors as manpower in the sex trade and other criminal activities. According to a 2007 UNICEF report on Child Trafficking in Europe, 2 million children are being trafficked in Europe every year. Child trafficking occurs in virtually all countries in Europe. There is no clear-cut distinction between countries of origin and destination in Europe. Trafficking in children has been perceived mainly in connection with sexual exploitation, but the reality is much more complex. Children in Europe are also trafficked for exploitation through labour, domestic servitude, begging, criminal activities and other exploitative purposes.

In the report, UNICEF also warns that there is a dramatic absence of harmonized and systematic data collection, analysis and dissemination at all levels without which countries lack important evidence that informs national policies and responses. Missing Children Europe, the European federation for missing children, aims to meet this need. The CRM system is expected to have a clear impact on the way hotlines are able to work together and collect data on the problem of missing children.

The British Asylum Screening Unit estimated that 60% of the unaccompanied minors accommodated in social care centres in the UK go missing and are not found again. In the UK these open centres, from where minors are able to call their traffickers, act as 'human markets' for the facilitators and traffickers who generally collect their prey within 24 hours of arrival in the UK. According to the CIA out of the 800,000 people trafficked annually across national borders in the world, up to 50% are minors.

The [[United Nations]] is operating a [[International Commission on Missing Persons|Commission on Missing Persons]] that serves as an international coordination center and provides also statistical material regarding missing persons worldwide. The [[Restoring Family Links|International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] strives to clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing persons when loss of contact is due to armed conflict or other situations of violence; natural or man-made disaster; migration and in other situations of humanitarian need. It is also supporting the families of missing persons to rebuild their social lives and find emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://familylinks.icrc.org/en/Pages/HowWeWork/Missing-Persons-and-their-Families.aspx |title=Restoring Family Links – Missing Persons and their Families |publisher=Familylinks.icrc.org |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223044829/http://familylinks.icrc.org/en/Pages/HowWeWork/Missing-Persons-and-their-Families.aspx |archivedate=February 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mission statement''' is a short statement of an [[organization]]'s purpose, identifying the goal of its operations: what kind of product or service it provides, its primary customers or [[Market (economics)|market]], and its geographical region of operation.&lt;ref name=Entrepreneur/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt; It may include a short statement of such fundamental matters as the organization's values or philosophies, a business's main competitive advantages, or a desired future state—the "vision".&lt;ref name=Entrepreneur/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;

A mission  is not simply a description of an organization by an external party, but an expression, made by its leaders, of their desires and intent for the organization. The purpose of a mission statement is to focus and direct the organization itself. It communicates primarily to the people who make up the organization—its members or employees—giving them a shared understanding of the organization's intended direction. Organizations normally do not change their mission statements over time, since they define their continuous, ongoing purpose and focus.&lt;ref name=BusinessDict/&gt;

According to [[Chris Bart]], professor of strategy and governance at [[McMaster University]],&lt;ref name=Bromides/&gt; a commercial mission statement consists of three essential components:&lt;ref name=SexLies/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

# [[Key market]]: the target audience
# Contribution: the product or service
# Distinction: what makes the product unique or why the audience should buy it over another

Bart estimates that in practice, only about ten percent of mission statements say something meaningful.&lt;ref name=Bromides/&gt; For this reason, they are widely regarded with contempt.&lt;ref name=SexLies/&gt;

== Purpose ==
{{or-section|date=January 2018}}
The sole purpose of a mission statement is to serve as a company's goal/agenda, it outlines clearly what the [[goal]] of the company is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Post |first=Jennifer |date=3 May 2017 |title = What is a Mission Statement?|url = http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/3783-mission-statement.html|website = Business News Daily|publisher=Purch|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some generic examples of mission statements would be, "To provide the best service possible within the banking sector for our customers." or "To provide the best experience for all of our customers." The reason why businesses make use of mission statements is to make it clear what they look to achieve as an organization, not only to themselves and their employees but to the customers and other people who are a part of the business, such as [[shareholder]]s. As a company evolves, so will their mission statement. This is to make sure that the company remains on track and to ensure that the mission statement does not lose its touch and become boring or stale.

It is important that a mission statement is not confused with a [[vision statement]]. As discussed earlier, the main purpose of a mission statement is to get across the ambitions of an [[Organization|organisation]] in a short and simple fashion, it is not necessary to go into detail for the mission statement which is evident in examples given. The reason why it is important that a mission statement and vision statement are not confused is because they both serve different purposes. Vision statements tend to be more related to strategic planning and lean more towards discussing where a company aims to be in the future.

== Advantages ==
'''Provides direction:''' Mission statements are a way to direct a business into the right path. They play a part in helping the business make better decisions which can be beneficial to them. Without the mission statement providing direction, businesses may struggle when it comes to making decisions and planning for the future. This is why providing direction could be considered one of the most advantageous points of a mission statement.

'''Clear purpose:''' Having a clear purpose can remove any potential ambiguities that can surround the existence of a business. People who are interested in the progression of the business, such as [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, will want to know that the business is making the right choices and progressing more towards achieving their goals, which will help to remove any doubt the stakeholders may have in the business.

A mission statement can act as a motivational tool within an organisation, and it can allow employees to all work towards one common goal that benefits both the organisation and themselves. This can help with factors such as [[Job satisfaction|employee satisfaction]] and productivity. It is important that employees feel a sense of purpose. Giving them this sense of purpose will allow them to focus more on their daily tasks and help them to realise the goals of the organisation and their role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Benefits of Vision and Mission Statements |url = http://clearlogic.ca/benefits-of-vision-and-mission-statements/|website =Clearlogic Consulting Professionals |date=2013 |accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Roger |last=Vozar |date=1 June 2013 |title = How organizations benefit from having a clearly defined mission |url = http://www.sbnonline.com/article/how-organizations-benefit-from-having-a-clearly-defined-mission/|website = Smart Business Magazine|publisher=Smart Business Network Inc. |accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Although it is mostly beneficial for a business to craft a good mission statement, there are some situations where a mission statement can be considered pointless or not useful to a business.

'''Unrealistic:''' In most cases, mission statements turn out to be unrealistic and far too optimistic. An unrealistic mission statement can also affect the performance and [[morale]] of the employees within the workplace. This is because an unrealistic mission statement would reduce the likelihood of employees being able to meet this standard which could demotivate [[employees]] in the long term. Unrealistic mission statements also serve no purpose and can be considered a waste of management's time. Another issue which could arise from an unrealistic mission statement is that poor decisions could be made in an attempt to achieve this goal which has the potential to harm the business and be seen as a waste of both time and resources.

'''Waste of time and resources:''' Mission statements require planning. This takes time and effort for those who are responsible for creating the mission statement. If the mission statement is not achieved, then the process of creating the mission statement could be seen as a waste of time for all of the people involved. A lot of thought and time can be spent in designing a good mission statement, and to have all of that time wasted is not what businesses can afford. The wasted time could have been spent on much more important tasks within the organisation such as [[decision-making]] for the [[business]].

== Design ==
According to an independent contributor to [[Forbes]], the following questions must be answered in the mission statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Patrick |last=Hull |date=10 January 2013 |title = Answer 4 Questions to Get a Great Mission Statement|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickhull/2013/01/10/answer-4-questions-to-get-a-great-mission-statement/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-11-02|publisher=Forbes Media, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* “What do we do?” — The mission statement should clearly outline the main purpose of the organisation, and what they do.
* “How do we do it?” — It should also mention how one plans on achieving the mission statement.
* “Whom do we do it for?” — The audience of the mission statement should be clearly stated within the mission statement.
* “What value are we bringing?” — The benefits and values of the mission statement should be clearly outlined.

When designing a mission statement, it should be very clear to the audience what the purpose of it is. It is ideal for a business to be able to communicate their mission, goals and objectives to the reader without including any unnecessary information through the mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=30 October 2003 |title=How to Write Your Mission Statement |url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/65230 |website=Entrepreneur |publisher=Entrepreneur Media, Inc. |accessdate=2015-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FEMA - 44805 - FEMA Mission Statement posted at a Joint Field Office in TN.jpg|thumb|US [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]'s Mission Statement Poster]]
[[Richard Branson]] has commented on ways of crafting a good mission statement; he explains the importance of having a mission statement that is clear and straight to the point and does not contain unnecessary baffling. He went on to analyse a mission statement, using [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]]'s mission statement at the time (2013) as an example. In his evaluation of the mission statement, he seemed to suggest that while the statement sounded interesting, most people would not be able to understand the message it is putting across. In other words the message of the mission statement potentially meant nothing to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Richard |last=Branson |author-link=Richard Branson |date=22 July 2013 |title = Richard Branson on Crafting Your Mission Statement|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/227507|website = Entrepreneur|publisher=Entrepreneur Media, Inc.|accessdate = 2015-11-02|dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023071226/https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/227507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|This further backs up the idea that a good mission statement is one that is clear and answers the right questions in a simple manner, and does not over complicate things. An example of a good mission statement would be Google's, which is "to organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Andrew |last=Thompson|date=20 August 2015 |title = Google's Vision Statement &amp; Mission Statement|url = http://panmore.com/google-vision-statement-mission-statement|website = Panmore Institute|accessdate = 2015-11-02 |dead-url=no |archive-date=13 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113110528/http://panmore.com/google-vision-statement-mission-statement }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not in source|date=April 2017}}}}

'''Moabite''' is an extinct [[Canaanite language]] formerly spoken in [[Moab]] (modern day central-western [[Jordan]]) in the early [[1st millennium BC]]. It was written using a variant of the [[Phoenician alphabet]].&lt;ref name="ISBE"&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoffrey W. |last=Bromiley|work=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia|publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year= 2007|page= 395 |title=Moab |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zkla5Gl_66oC&amp;pg=PA395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most knowledge about Moabite comes from the [[Mesha Stele]],&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt; which is the only known extensive text in the language. In addition, there is the three-line [[El-Kerak Inscription]] and a few seals. The main features distinguishing Moabite from fellow Canaanite languages such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] are: a plural in ''-în'' rather than ''-îm'' (e.g. ''mlkn'' "kings" for [[Biblical Hebrew]] ''məlākîm''), like [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Arabic]]; retention of the feminine ending ''-at'' or "-ah", which Biblical Hebrew reduces to ''-āh'' only (e.g. ''qiryat'' or ''qiryah'', "town", Biblical Hebrew ''qiryāh'') but retains in the construct state nominal form (e.g. ''qiryát yisrael'' "town of Israel"); and retention of a verb form with infixed ''-t-'', also found in Arabic and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (''w-’ltḥm'' "I began to fight", from the root ''lḥm'').

According to ''[[Glottolog]]'', referencing Huehnergard &amp; Rubin (2011), Moabite was not a distinct language from Hebrew.&lt;ref name="Glottolog2" /&gt; Moabite differed only dialectally from Hebrew, and Moabite religion and culture was related to that of the [[Israelites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Moabite|title=Moabite {{!}} people|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, although Moabite itself had begun to diverge, the script used in the 9th century BC did not differ from the script used in Hebrew inscriptions at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.se/books?isbn=0805446796|title=isbn:0805446796 - Sök på Google|website=books.google.se|language=sv-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While knowledge of Moabite is limited primarily to the [[Mesha Stele]] and a few seals, it is clear that Moabite is a dialect of Hebrew and is closely related to [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Ugaritic]] and Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.se/books?isbn=0802837859|title=isbn:0802837859 - Sök på Google|website=books.google.se|language=sv-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alphabet==

Moabite appears to use a variant of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], much like [[Paleo-Hebrew]]. Most of the letters don't seem to have changed in appearance in Moabite context, however a few have noticeable differences.

'''Ndrumbea''', variously spelled '''Ndumbea, Dubea, Drubea''' and '''Païta''', is a [[New Caledonian languages|New Caledonian language]] that gave its name to the capital of New Caledonia, [[Nouméa]], and the neighboring town of [[Dumbéa]]. It has been displaced to villages outside the capital, with fewer than a thousand speakers remaining. Gordon (1995) estimates that there may only be two or three hundred. The Dubea are the people; the language has been called Naa Dubea (or more precisely Ṇã́ã Ṇḍùmbea) "language of Dubea". 

Ndrumbea is one of the few [[Austronesian languages]] that is [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]], and it has a series of consonants that are also unusual for the region.

==Phonology==
Ndrumbea, like its close relative [[Numee language|Numee]], is a tonal language, with three contrasting tones, high, mid, and low.

===Vowels===
Ndrumbea has seven oral vowels, long and short. The mid front vowels are lower when short than long: {{IPA|/i e ɛ a o ʊ u/; /iː ɪː eː aː oː ʊː uː/}}. There are five [[nasal vowel]]s, also long and short: {{IPA|/ĩ ẽ ã õ ũ/; /ĩː ẽː ãː õː ũː/}}. These interact with nasal consonants, described below. Back vowels do not occur after labialized consonants, {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, or {{IPA|/ɣ/}}. In addition to the complementary correlation of nasal vowels with nasal consonants, nasal vowels do not occur after {{IPA|/j, ɽ, ɣ/}}. {{IPA|/ɣ/}}–oral vowel derives historically from {{IPA|ŋ}}–nasal vowel. 

Phonetically, a stop–flap consonant cluster will be separated by an obscure [[epenthetic vowel]] with the quality of the following phonemic vowel.

===Consonants===
Nasal vowels once contrasted after [[nasal stop]]s, as they still do in Numee. However, in Ndrumbea, nasal stops partially denasalized before oral vowels, so that now [[prenasalized stop]]s precede oral vowels, and nasal stops precede nasal vowels. Similarly, {{IPA|/j/}} only occurs before oral vowels.

|}

The fricatives {{IPA|/v, ɣ/}} are sometimes realized as approximants {{IPA|[ʋ, ɰ]}}. However, the approximants {{IPA|/w, j/}} are never fricated. The nasal stop {{IPA|/n̠/}} sometimes has incomplete closure, producing a nasalized approximant {{IPA|[ȷ̃]}}. The {{IPA|/ɽ/}} is most often a tap {{IPA|[ɽ]}}, sometimes an approximant {{IPA|[ɻ]}}, and occasionally an alveolar tap or trill, {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or {{IPA|[r]}}. It does not occur word initially, and does not contrast with {{IPA|/ɳ/}} word medially. It tends to be nasalized before a nasal vowel, {{IPA|[ɽ̃] ~ [ɳ̆] ~ [ɻ̃]}} with the nasality spreading to preceding vowels: {{IPA|/t̠ɽáɽẽ/}} "to run" has been recorded as {{IPA|[t̠&lt;sup&gt;á&lt;/sup&gt;ɽ̃ã́ɻ̃ẽ]}}. 

Ndrumbea contrasts three [[coronal consonant|coronal]] places, articulated with the tip or blade of the tongue contacting the roof of the mouth: {{IPA|/t̪/}}, {{IPA|/ʈ/}}, {{IPA|/t̠/}} and their nasal homologs. {{IPA|/ʈ/}} is [[apical consonant|apical]], in contrast to [[laminal consonant|laminal]] {{IPA|/t̠/}}. It is not clear if {{IPA|/t̪/}} is apico-dental or [[denti-alveolar]], but it has a sharp release burst. {{IPA|/ʈ/}}, on the other hand, has a noisy release and approaches an affricate, {{IPA|[ʈᶳ]}}. It may actually be closer to an alveolar than post-alveolar, and appears to be enunciated more forcefully than {{IPA|/t̪/}}. {{IPA|/t̠/}} also has a fricated release, and for many speakers this is longer than that of {{IPA|/ʈ/}}.

'''Nigar Khudadat qizi Rafibeyli''' ({{lang-az|Nigar Xudadat qızı Rəfibəyli}}) (1913–1981, [[Baku]]) was an Azerbaijani writer and the Chairman of the Writers' Union of [[Azerbaijan]]. She was the mother of [[Anar Rzayev]], novel and short-story writer, and wife of famous writer and poet [[Rasul Rza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Early life==
Nigar Rafibeyli was born on 23 June 1913 in the town of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]. Her parents were medical surgeons. Her father, [[Khudadat Rafibeyli]] was the first [[Azerbaijan|Azeri]] surgeon who had studied in Europe. In 1919, he was invited to head the Ganja government by the republican government of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], but he was soon arrested at instigation by [[Armenians|Armenian]] bolsheviks and sent to [[Nargin (island)|Nargin]] island, where he was executed by bolshevik soldiers.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{Cite web

| accessdate = 17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nigar Rafibeyli finished her school in Ganja and moved to [[Baku]] for her higher education. She studied at Pedagogical Technical School. She taught at school but always wrote novels. Her first poem called "Chadra" (Veil in [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]) was published in "Dan Ulduzu" magazine in 1928. In years 1930–1932 she worked in the [[Azerbaijanfilm]] studio.

==Later years==
In 1931, she worked in [[Azerneshr]] publishing house as the editor and the translator. Rafibeyli then continued her studies in Moscow Pedagogical University. As she studied in Moscow, her first collection of poems was published in Baku. In years 1937–1939, she worked in [[Ushaqneshr]] publishing house. Beginning from 1940, she translated into Azeri many works of famous poets and writers of other nations such as [[Ali-Shir Nava'i|Navai]], [[Schiller]], [[Pushkin]], [[Lermontov]], [[Taras Shevchenko|Shevchenko]] and others. For her great contributions to [[Azerbaijani literature]], she received order of Honour.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; Many of Nigar Rafibeyli's works were dedicated to [[romanticism]], [[motherhood]], [[nature]], [[motherland]].&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9430">In 1999, the Minority Language Committee of [[Sweden]] formally declared five official minority languages: [[Finnish language|Finnish]],  [[Sami languages|Sami]], [[Romany language|Romani]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], and [[Meänkieli language|Meänkieli]] (Tornedal Finnish). 

The [[Swedish language]] dominates commercial and cultural life in Sweden but did not officially become the country's main language until 2009, when a new language law entered into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20404/20090701/|title=Swedish becomes official 'main language'|last=Landes|first=David|date=2009-07-01|website=Thelocal.se|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for this legal status had been the subject of protracted debate and proposed legislation was narrowly defeated in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22620&amp;a=500469 Svenskan blir inte officiellt språk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014093208/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22620&amp;a=500469 |date=2009-10-14 }}, ''[[Sveriges Television]]'', 2005-12-07. Retrieved on July 23, 2006. (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The minority languages have been legally recognized to protect the cultural and historical heritage of their respective speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy'', 3(2), 181-201. &lt;/ref&gt; These communities are given certain rights on that basis, such as school education in their language, and its use in dealing with governmental agencies.

== Criteria for inclusion ==
These are the criteria established by the Minority Language Committee, influenced by the directives from the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in 1997.

To be accorded official minority status, a language must have been spoken in Sweden for a significant amount of time. A precise figure has not been revealed, but qualified estimations consider 100 years to be reasonable, based on the included and excluded languages. A significant immigration to Sweden did not start until after [[World War I]], and many languages currently spoken by a large number of people in Sweden are excluded, among them [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. 

It is also required that the language be spoken by a significant number of people and be centred in a specific geographical region (the latter, however, not applied for Romani and Yiddish).

Furthermore, it is a condition that the granting of official minority language status should be of cultural benefit to the group speaking it. It is allegedly for this reason that [[Swedish Sign Language]] was not included &amp;ndash; even though it is a unique language with a history dating back to the 18th century, it was considered to have a sufficiently stable basis already in Swedish culture. 

Common culture is yet another criterion for inclusion.

== Affected languages ==

=== Finnish ===
[[Finnish language|Finnish]] has been spoken in Sweden ever since the (then provincial) borders were drawn in the 13th century. Sweden has always had a significant migration to and from Finland. As the two languages belong to different [[language family|language families]] it is easy to distinguish them, unlike the neighbouring languages [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]. The number of Finnish speakers in Sweden today has been estimated to over 460,000. Even though many current Swedes are of full or mixed Finnish descent, Swedish is the main language in practice for many bilinguals.

Finnish and Meänkieli can be used in the northernmost municipalities of [[Gällivare Municipality|Gällivare]], [[Haparanda Municipality|Haparanda]], [[Kiruna Municipality|Kiruna]], [[Pajala Municipality|Pajala]] and [[Övertorneå Municipality|Övertorneå]] and its immediate neighbourhood.

On 11 December, 2007, Finnish Broadcasting Company [[YLE]] reported, that in [[Uppsala]], Sweden, speaking Finnish was forbidden from municipal employees, and that this was the case also with small talk during breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/24h/id77223.html|title=Uppsala kielsi suomen kielen käytön|website=Yle Uutiset|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an agreement between the city council and the municipal trade union the official working language is Swedish and two employees were not allowed to speak Finnish with one another in the common work premises or in break rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2007/12/18/feldt-ranta-fragar-om-uppsala-fallet|title=Feldt-Ranta frågar om Uppsala-fallet|website=Svenska.yle.fi|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Equality Ombudsman]] considered that a ban was permissible in that particular case.&lt;ref&gt;Stockholm County Board, ''Från erkännande till egenmakt, från ord till handling. Rapport från konferens om den minoritetspolitiska reformen.'' May 2010[http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/stockholm/SiteCollectionDocuments/Sv/manniska-och-samhalle/nationella-minoriteter/Dokumentation_konferens_7_maj_2010.pdf]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meänkieli ===
[[Meänkieli]] or Tornionlaaksonsuomi or Tornedalian language is spoken by a population in northern Sweden. It is closely related to and mutually intelligible with Finnish and often considered a dialect thereof, with many loanwords from Swedish. Especially in Finland the distinction of Meänkieli as a separate language is seen as [[language politics]] not based in linguistics (see [[Kven language]] for a similar situation in [[Norway]]). Meänkieli and Swedish are not mutualy inteligible. The number of speakers amount to 50,000 or so.

=== Sami languages ===
The [[Sami language]]s are actually not one language, even though they are commonly referred to as such. In Sweden, three Sámi languages are spoken, with the other 7 Sámi languages being spoken in Norway, Russia and Finland. The history of the Sami languages can be traced back at least 2,000 years. In total, they are spoken by a minimum of 40,000 people throughout the four countries.

As a minority language, Sami is an official language and may be used in [[Government agencies in Sweden|government agencies]], [[court]]s, [[preschool]]s and [[nursing home]]s in the [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] where it is most common. 

=== Romani ===
[[Romani language|Romani chib]], the language of [[Romani people]], has been spoken in Sweden since the 16th century. Today about 9,500 people speak it in Sweden. It does not have a geographical center, but is considered to be of historical importance.

=== Yiddish ===
[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] has been a common language of [[Ashkenazi]] (Central and Eastern European) [[Jew]]s since early in their history. The first Jews were permitted to reside in Sweden during the late 18th century.
As of 2009, the Jewish population in Sweden was estimated at around 20,000. Out of these 2,000-6,000 claim to have at least some knowledge of Yiddish according to various reports and surveys. The number of native speakers among these has been estimated by linguist Mikael Parkvall to be 750-1,500. It is believed that virtually all native speakers of Yiddish in Sweden today are adults, and most of them elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Mikael Parkvall, ''Sveriges språk. Vem talar vad och var?''. RAPPLING 1. Rapporter från Institutionen för lingvistik vid Stockholms universitet. 2009[https://web.archive.org/web/20140920233246/http://www.xn--sprkfrsvaret-vcb4v.se/sf/fileadmin/PDF/Parkvall_spraakstatistik.pdf], pp. 68-72&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization ''Sveriges Jiddischförbund'' (Yiddish Association of Sweden) has been the national parent organization for Yiddish speakers and has four local chapters in [[Borås]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Malmö]]. It has been active since 1976 and was previously known as ''Sällskapet för jiddisch och jiddischkultur i Sverige'' (The Society for Yiddish and Yiddish Culture in Sweden) which is now the name of the chapter based in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Sveriges Jiddischförbund, [http://www.jiddischforbundet.se/index.php/detta-aer-jiddischfoerbundet Detta är Jiddischförbundet]. Retrieved 13 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romani and Yiddish have minority language status throughout the country and are covered by government obligations regarding their preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manskligarattigheter.gov.se/dynamaster/file_archive/050216/24a99c86fd734f15c9f722b343cc152e/FaktaJu%5f0415ji.pdf|format=PDF|title=נאַציאָנאַלע מינאָריטעטן|website=Manskligarattigheter.gov.se|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phanishwar Nath 'Renu''''&lt;ref name=padma/&gt; (4 March 1921 – 11 April 1977) was one of the most successful and influential writers of modern [[Hindi]] literature in the post-[[Premchand]] era. He is the author of ''[[Maila Anchal]]'', which after [[Premchand]]'s ''[[Godaan]]'', is regarded as the most significant Hindi novel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seasonsindia.com/art_culture/lit_hindi_sea.htm#renu Phanishwar Nath 'Renu' Profile] ''Seasoninindia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Phanishwar Nath (Mandal) Renu was born on 4 March 1921 in a small village Aurahi Hingna near Simraha railway station in Bihar. The [[Mandal (surname)]] community to which Renu belonged constitutes an under-privileged social group in India. Renu's family, however, enjoyed the benefits of land, education, and social prestige. Renu's father, Shilanath Mandal, had been active in the Indian National Movement and was an extremely enlightened individual, taking a keen interest in modern ideas, culture and art.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freed from disgrace = Kalankmukti |last=Introduction by Anand Prakash|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-568599-2|location=new delhi|page=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phanishwar Nath 'Renu' is best known for promoting the voice of the contemporary rural India through the genre of 'Aanchalik Upanyas' (Regional Story), and is placed amongst the pioneering Hindi writers who brought regional voices into the mainstream Hindi literature. Renu was very close associate of Bengali novelist [[Satinath Bhaduri]]. He wrote a memoirs named ''Bhaduriji'' (Mr. Bhaduri) in [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His short story "Maare Gaye Gulfam" was adapted into a film ''[[Teesri Kasam]]'' (The Third Vow),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120630204807/http://www.uiowa.edu/~linguist/faculty/davison/PREFACE.pdf TISRI QASAM The Third Vow] [[University of Iowa]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Basu Bhattacharya]] (produced by the poet-lyricist [[Shailendra (lyricist)|Shailendra]]) in 1966 for which he also wrote the dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1127232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later his short story "Panchlight" (Petromax) was made into a TV short film. The 2017 [[Bollywood]] Film ''[[Panchlait]]'' is also based on this short story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/panchlait-teaser-phanishwar-nath-renu-s-short-story-on-silver-screen/story-Gpk3NrppZtYajepv4RlLEK.html|title= Phanishwar Nath Renu’s short story on silver screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''primate city distribution'' is a [[rank-size distribution]] that has one very large city with many much smaller cities and towns, and no intermediate-sized urban centres: a [[King effect]], visible as an outlier on an otherwise linear graph, when the rest of the data fit a [[power law]] or [[stretched exponential function]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/rb/rb186.html GaWC Research Bulletin 186&lt;/ref&gt; The ''law of the primate city'' was first proposed by the [[geographer]] [[Mark Jefferson (geographer)|Mark Jefferson]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="about.com"&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/primatecities.htm The Law of the Primate City and the Rank-Size Rule, by Matt Rosenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; He defines a primate city as being "at least twice as large as the next largest city and more than twice as significant."&lt;ref name="Jefferson 1939"&gt;Jefferson. "The Law of the Primate City", in Geographical Review 29 (April 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from size and economic influence, a primate city will usually have precedence in all other aspects of its country's society, such as being a center of politics, media, culture and education and receive most [[internal migration]].

== Significance ==
[[File:Countries without a primate city.png|thumb|right|Countries / regions colored in red have no primate city.]]
Not all countries have primate cities, but in those that do, the rest of the country depends on it for cultural, economic, political, and major transportation needs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} On the other hand, the primate city depends on the rest of the country as paying consumers of the cultural, economic, political and other services produced in the area.

The presence of a primate city in a country may indicate an imbalance in development&amp;nbsp;– usually a progressive core, and a lagging periphery, on which the city depends for labor and other resources.&lt;ref&gt;Brunn, Stanley et al. Cities of the World. Boulder, CO: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, the urban structure is not directly dependent on a country's level of [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

Many of the primate cities are increasing their percentage of their country's population. This can be because the number of traditional workers have been reduced because of mechanization in the manufacturing industry, agriculture, and other [[Blue-collar workers|blue-collar industries]], which are generally located throughout all of the country. At the same time, the number of educated employees in service business such as politics, economy, culture, media, and higher education has been rising, and those sectors are often located in the capital where the power and money is concentrated.

== Examples ==
&lt;!-- Please do NOT include an example without a reliable source. --&gt;
Many [[Global city|alpha world cities]] are considered national and/or regional primate cities.&lt;ref name="Jefferson 1939"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gssYJXHQO7gC&amp;pg=PA41 |first= Tuna |last= Taşan-Kok |title= Mexico, Istanbul and Warsaw: Institutional and spatial change |page=41 |publisher= Eburon Uitgeverij |year=2004 |isbn= 978-905972041-1 |accessdate= 2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include the two alpha++ world cities of [[London]] in the United Kingdom (national) and [[New York City]] in the United States (regional), though the U.S. has never had any primate city on a national scale.&lt;ref name="GaWC2012"&gt;{{cite web |title= The World According to GaWC 2012 |url= http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2012t.html |website= Globalization and World Cities Research Network |publisher= Loughborough University |accessdate= 11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Budapest]], [[Dublin]], [[Jakarta]], [[Lima]], [[Mexico City]], [[Cape Town]] and [[Seoul]] have also been described as primate cities within their respective countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pacione |first=Michael |title= Urban Geography: A Global Perspective |publisher= Routledge |location= Abingdon |year=2005 |edition=2nd |pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bangkok]], the capital of [[Thailand]], has been called "the most primate city on Earth", being roughly thirty-five times larger than Thailand's second-largest city of [[Nakhon Ratchasima]].&lt;ref&gt;"จำนวนเทศบาลตำบล"&gt;ส่วนวิจัยและพัฒนาระบบ รูปแบบและโครงสร้าง สำนักพัฒนาระบบ รูปแบบและโครงสร้าง กรมส่งเสริมการปกครองท้องถิ่น." [ออนไลน์]. เข้าถึงได้จาก: [http://www.dla.go.th/work/abt/summarize.jsp] 2557. สืบค้น 6 กุมภาพันธ์ 2558.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the concept from his examination of the primate city during the [[2010 Thai political protests]] and applying it to the role that primate cities play if they are national capitals, Jack Fong's study noted that when primate cities like Bangkok function as national capitals, they are inherently vulnerable to insurrectionary dynamics by the subaltern, and the dispossessed. He cites the simple fact that most primate cities serving as national capitals contain major headquarters for the country. Thus, logistically, it is rather "efficient" for national targets to be contested since they are all located within one major urban environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fong|first1=Jack|title=Political Vulnerabilities of a Primate City: The May 2010 Red Shirts Uprising in Bangkok, Thailand.|journal=Journal of Asian and African Studies|date=2013|volume=48|issue=3|pages=332–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Urban primacy ==
Urban primacy indicates the ratio of the primate city to the next largest i.e the second largest in a country or region. In other words, urban primacy can be defined as the central place in an urban or city network that has acquired or obtained a great level of dominance. The level of dominance is measured by population density and the number of functions offered. Higher functions and population will result in higher dominance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">'''Renaud Girard''', born 25 May 1955 in New York City, is a French journalist and writer. He studied at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]] and the [[Ecole Nationale d'Administration]]. He has worked as a war correspondent and written books about the Middle East, [[geopolitics]] and [[international relations]].

He is an advocate of [[Realism (international relations)|political realism]]. One of his concepts is that of the "principal enemy" (''ennemi principal''), which constitutes a hierarchy of political priorities. For example, in the [[Syrian Civil War]], he considers the principal enemy to be [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] jihadists, which makes it acceptable to seek alliances with [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] [[Islamism|Islamist]] groups such as [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Girard|first=Renaud|year=2015|url=http://rddm.revuedesdeuxmondes.fr/archive/article.php?code=73112|title=Savoir désigner notre ennemi princual|language=French|journal=[[Revue des deux Mondes]]|issue=3|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concept he uses is that of "blatant evil" (''mal flagrant''), which creates distinctions between different dictatorships. A dictatorship may be deserving of strong criticism, but at the same time not legitimize mass murder or strive for unlimited expansion, in which case it can not be considered as blatantly evil. This is exemplified by the regimes of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Bashar al-Assad]]. On the other hand, [[NS Germany]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] are examples which Girard regards as blatantly evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-08-31|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/olivier-d-auzon/lutte-contre-daech_b_8063432.html|title=Quand les Occidentaux sont tétanisés par les destructions de Palmyre|language=French|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-08-24|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/monde/2015/08/24/31002-20150824ARTFIG00329-indignation-et-action-le-decalage-de-l-occident-face-a-l-etat-islamique.php|title=Indignation et action : le décalage de l'Occident face à l'État islamique|language=French|work=[[Le Figaro]]|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girard is very critical of the [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] movement and its doctrine of trying to impose democracy on other countries by force. He has argued that the United States under [[George W. Bush]] prioritized democracy in Iraq over the prospect of peace, which only lead to failure and took the country further from democracy than it was when the operation began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2014-06-13|last=Bastié|first=Eugénie|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/monde/2014/06/13/31002-20140613ARTFIG00424-irak-on-n-impose-pas-la-democratie-a-coup-de-chasseurs-bombardiers.php|title=Irak : "On n'impose pas la démocratie à coup de chasseurs bombardiers"|language=French|work=[[Le Figaro]]|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Secondary reference''' points to the [[understanding|representation]] as a necessary part in granting a [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] to a (part of a) [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In this approach, [[word]]s that don’t contribute to the representation are void; they can only provide a figurative expression. Examples of phrases which lack a secondary reference are 'a black Monday' (unless it is used figuratively) and [[Bernard Bolzano]]'s 'round [[quadrilateral|quadrangle]]'. [[Alexius Meinong]]'s Types of [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] can be mentioned here, too.

In the first case, one may have a representation of a Monday (or at least of something one calls a Monday), as well as of something black, but not of a 'black Monday', since these qualities don’t combine ('Monday' being too abstract to be combined with a concrete quality such as a color). In the second case, there is an incongruity: a quadrangle can be represented, but not a round one; conversely, there can be a circle, but it can’t be square. It may, therefore, be debated whether a representation is created here.

Another example is presented by [[George Berkeley]]. He says: "[...] Does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle (which is yet none of the most abstract, comprehensive and difficult) for it must be neither [[Oblique projection|oblique]] nor [[rectangle]], neither [[equilateral]], equicrural, nor scalenon, but ''all and none'' of these at once?" (''A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', Introduction, section 13.) Berkeley is here criticizing [[John Locke]], demonstrating that each representation is particular (i.e., individual).

Whether there is a meaning or not depends on the individual person: it is possible that a sentence has a meaning according to A, whereas B can’t discern any. This may, e.g., result from relevant knowledge which A possesses and B lacks, as in the case where one should decide the answer to the question 'Is 15 a prime number?' and A knows what a prime number is and B doesn’t; the sentence then doesn’t have a meaning for B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38954">'''Specific language impairment''' ('''SLI''') is diagnosed when a child's language does not develop normally and the difficulties cannot be accounted for by generally slow development, physical abnormality of the speech apparatus, [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[apraxia]], acquired brain damage or [[hearing loss]]. [[Twin study|Twin studies]] have shown that it is under [[Heredity|genetic]] influence. Although language impairment can result from a single-gene mutation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lai, C. S., Fisher, S. E., Hurst, J. A., Vargha-Khadem, F., &amp; Monaco, A. P.|first=|year=2001|title=A forkhead-domain gene is mutated in a severe speech and language disorder|url=http://www.nature.com.proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/nature/journal/v413/n6855/abs/413519a0.html|journal=Nature|volume=413 |issue=6855|pages=519–523|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is unusual. More commonly SLI results from the combined influence of multiple genetic variants, each of which is found in the general population, as well as environmental influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bishop|first=D. V. M|date=2002-07-01|title=The role of genes in the etiology of specific language impairment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021992402000874|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=35|issue=4|pages=311–328|doi=10.1016/S0021-9924(02)00087-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Specific language impairment (SLI) is diagnosed when a child has delayed or disordered language development for no apparent reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bishop, D ; Norbury, C. F. |chapter=Speech and language impairments |editors=Anita Thapar; Sir Michael Rutter; Bishop, Dorothy ; Daniel Pine; Scott, Steven M.; Jim Stevenson; Taylor, Eric; Eds |title=Rutter's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2008 |pages=782–801 |isbn=1-4051-4549-8 |oclc=473789535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the first indication of SLI is that the child is later than usual in starting to speak and subsequently is delayed in putting words together to form sentences. [[Spoken language]] may be immature. In many children with SLI, understanding of [[language]], or ''receptive'' language, is also impaired, though this may not be obvious unless the child is given a formal assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bishop, D. |title=Uncommon understanding: development and disorders of language comprehension in children |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-86377-260-9 |oclc=776282908 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although difficulties with use and understanding of complex sentences are a common feature of SLI, the diagnostic criteria encompass a wide range of problems, and for some children other aspects of language are problematic (see below). In general, the term SLI is reserved for children whose language difficulties persist into school age, and so it would not be applied to toddlers who are late to start talking, most of whom catch up with their peer group after a late start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Donna J. Thal |author2=Jeanette Katich | chapter=Predicaments in early identification of specific language impairment : does the early bird always catch the worm? | title=Assessment of Communication and Language (Communication and Language Intervention Series) |editors=Donna J. Thal; Kevin N. Cole; Dale, Philip S. | publisher=Brookes Publishing Company |location= |year=1996 |pages=1–28 |isbn=1-55766-193-6 |oclc=34772171 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The terminology for children's language disorders is extremely wide-ranging and confusing, with many labels that have overlapping but not necessarily identical meanings. In part this confusion reflects uncertainty about the boundaries of SLI, and the existence of different subtypes. Historically, the terms "developmental dysphasia" or "developmental aphasia" were used to describe children with the clinical picture of SLI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ingram TT, Reid JF |title=Developmental aphasia observed in a department of child psychiatry |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=31 |issue=157 |pages=161–72 |date=June 1956 |pmid=13328151 |pmc=2011959 |doi= 10.1136/adc.31.157.161|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms have, however, largely been abandoned, as they suggest parallels with adult acquired [[aphasia]]. This is misleading, as SLI is not caused by brain damage.

Some synonyms currently in use for specific language impairment are language impairment, developmental language delay (DLD), language disorder, and language-learning disability. Researcher [[Bonnie Brinton]] argues that the term "specific language impairment" is misleading because the disorder does not only affect language, but also affects reading, writing, and social/pragmatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fujiki|first=Martin|last2=Spackman|first2=Matthew P.|last3=Brinton|first3=Bonnie|last4=Hall|first4=Andrea|date=2004-06-01|title=The Relationship of Language and Emotion Regulation Skills to Reticence in Children With Specific Language Impairment|url=https://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781463|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=637–646|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2004/049)|issn=1092-4388}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In medical circles, terms such as ''specific developmental language disorder'' are often used, but this has the disadvantage of being wordy, and is also rejected by some people who think SLI should not be seen as a "disorder". In the [[Education in the United Kingdom|UK educational system]], ''speech, language and communication needs'' (SLCN) is currently the term of choice, but this is far broader than SLI, and includes children with speech and language difficulties arising from a wide range of causes.

===Subtypes (Rapin and Allen 1987)===
Although most experts agree that children with SLI are quite variable, there is little agreement on how best to subtype them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bishop, D. V. M |chapter=Specific language impairment: diagnostic dilemma |editors=Hans Van Balkom; Verhoeven, Ludo Th |title=Classification of developmental language disorders: theoretical issues and clinical implications |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=2004 |pages= 309–326 |isbn=1-4106-0902-2 |oclc=53721852}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no widely accepted classification system. In 1983 [[Isabelle Rapin|Rapin]] and Allen&lt;ref&gt;Rapin, I., &amp; Allen, D. (1983). Developmental language disorders: nosologic considerations. In U. Kirk (Ed.), Neuropsychology of language, reading, and spelling (pp. 155–184). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a classification of developmental language disorders based on the [[Linguistics|linguistic]] features of language impairment, which was subsequently updated by Rapin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rapin I |title=Practitioner review: developmental language disorders: a clinical update |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=643–55 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8894945 |doi= 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1996.tb01456.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that Rapin is a child neurologist, and she refers to different subtypes as "syndromes"; many of those coming from the perspective of education or [[Speech-Language Pathology|speech-language therapy]] reject this kind of medical label, and argue that there is not a clear dividing line between SLI and normal variation.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, P. S., &amp; Cole, K. N. (1991). What's normal? Specific language impairment in an individual differences perspective. Language, Speech and Hearing Services in Schools, 22, 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, although most experts would agree that children with characteristics of the Rapin subtypes can be identified, there are many cases who are less easy to categorise, and there is also evidence that categorisation can change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conti-Ramsden G, Botting N |title=Classification of children with specific language impairment: longitudinal considerations |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=1195–204 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10515515 |doi= 10.1044/jslhr.4205.1195|url=http://jslhr.asha.org/cgi/content/abstract/42/5/1195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapin's subgroups fall into three broad categories:

====Receptive/expressive developmental language disorder====
Receptive/expressive phonologic/syntactic deficit syndrome is the most common form of SLI, in which the child's most obvious problems are a tendency to speak in short, simplified sentences, with omission of some [[Grammar|grammatical]] features, such as past tense -ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leonard, Laurence B. |title=Children with specific language impairment |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-585-27859-8 |oclc=45728290 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common also to see simplified [[speech production]] when the child is young. For instance, clusters of [[consonant]]s may be reduced, so that "string" is pronounced as "ting". Vocabulary is often limited, with a tendency to use "general all-purpose" terms, rather than more specific words.&lt;ref name="RiceBode1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rice|first1=M. L.|last2=Bode|first2=J. V.|title=GAPS in the verb lexicons of children with specific language impairment|journal=First Language|volume=13|issue=37|year=1993|pages=113–131 |issn=0142-7237 |doi=10.1177/014272379301303707}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leonard LB |title=Is expressive language disorder an accurate diagnostic category? |journal=Am J Speech Lang Pathol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=115–23 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19029534 |pmc=2718760 |doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2008/08-0064) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Auditory verbal agnosia|Verbal auditory agnosia]] is a very rare form of language impairment, in which the child appears unable to make sense of speech sounds. It typically occurs as a symptom of [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]], in which case a diagnosis of SLI would not be appropriate, as there is a known neurological origin of the language difficulties.

====Expressive developmental language disorder syndromes====
[[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|Developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD)]]￼￼ – in the child with DVD, comprehension is adequate; the onset of speech is very delayed and extremely limited with impaired production of speech sounds and short utterances. The poor speech production cannot be explained in terms of structural or neurological damage of the [[Speech organ|articulators]]. There is much disagreement about diagnostic criteria, but the label most often used for children whose intelligibility declines markedly when they attempt complex utterances, compared to when they are producing individual sounds or [[syllable]]s.

Another key feature is inconsistency of speech sound production from one occasion to another.  Although the term "[[Developmental coordination disorder|dyspraxia]]" suggests a pure output disorder,&lt;ref name="Hill EL 2001 149–71"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hill EL |title=Non-specific nature of specific language impairment: a review of the literature with regard to concomitant motor impairments |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=149–71 |year=2001 |pmid=11344592 |doi= 10.1080/13682820010019874|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; many – perhaps all – of these children have difficulty in doing tasks that involve mentally manipulating speech sounds, such as [[phonological awareness]] tasks. Children with DVD also typically have major literacy problems, and [[receptive language]] levels may be poor on tests of [[vocabulary]] and grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wells, Bill |author2=Stackhouse, Joy |title=Children's speech and literacy difficulties: a psycholinguistic framework |publisher=Singular Pub. Group |location=San Diego, Calif |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=1-86156-030-3 |oclc=246491090 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonologic programming deficit syndrome – the child speaks in long but poorly intelligible utterances, producing what sounds like [[neologism|jargon]]. Outside Rapin's group, little has been written about this subtype, which is not generally recognised in diagnostic frameworks.

====Higher order processing disorders====
Lexical deficit disorder – the child has word finding problems and difficulty putting ideas into words. There is poor comprehension for connected speech. Again, there is little research on this subtype, which is not widely recognised.

[[Pragmatic language impairment]] – the child speaks in fluent and well-formed utterances with adequate articulation; content of language is unusual; comprehension may be over-literal and language use is odd. The child may chatter incessantly and be poor at turn-taking in conversation and maintaining a topic. There has been a great deal of controversy about this category, which is termed ''pragmatic language impairment (PLI)'' in the UK. Debate has centred over the question of whether it is a subtype of SLI, part of the autistic spectrum, or a separate condition.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2000). Pragmatic language impairment: a correlate of SLI, a distinct subgroup, or part of the autistic continuum? In D. V. M. Bishop &amp; L. B. Leonard (Eds.), Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, Characteristics, Intervention and Outcome (pp. 99–113). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In DSM-5, the term ''Social Communication Disorder'' has been introduced; this is equivalent to PLI.

===Relationship with other neurodevelopmental disorders===
Although textbooks draw clear boundaries between different neurodevelopmental disorders, there is much debate about overlaps between them.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D., &amp; Rutter, M. (2008). Neurodevelopmental disorders: conceptual approaches. In M. Rutter, D. Bishop, D. Pine, S. Scott, J. Stevenson, E. Taylor &amp; A. Thapar (Eds.), Rutter's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (pp. 32–41). Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Many children with SLI meet diagnostic criteria for [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV, Snowling MJ |title=Developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment: same or different? |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=130 |issue=6 |pages=858–86 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15535741 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.6.858 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have features of [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2008). Specific language impairment, dyslexia, and autism: Using genetics to unravel their relationship. In C. F. Norbury, J. B. Tomblin &amp; D. V. M. Bishop (Eds.), Understanding developmental language disorders: from theory to practice (pp. 67–78). Hove: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
SLI is defined purely in behavioural terms: there is no biological test for SLI. There are three points that need to be met for a diagnosis of SLI:
*The child has language difficulties that interfere with daily life or academic progress
*Other causes are excluded: the problems cannot be explained in terms of hearing loss, general developmental delay, [[autism]], or physical difficulty in speaking
*Performance on a standardized language test (see assessment, below) is significantly below age level
There is considerable variation in how this last criterion is implemented. Tombin et al. (1996) proposed the EpiSLI criterion, based on five composite scores representing performance in three domains of language (vocabulary, grammar, and narration) and two modalities (comprehension and production). Children scoring in the lowest 10% on two or more composite scores are identified as having language disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomblin JB, Records NL, Zhang X |title=A system for the diagnosis of specific language impairment in kindergarten children |journal=J Speech Hear Res |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1284–94 |date=December 1996 |pmid=8959613 |doi= 10.1044/jshr.3906.1284|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
Assessment will usually include an interview with the child's caregiver, observation of the child in an unstructured setting, a hearing test, and standardized tests of language and nonverbal ability. There is a wide range of language assessments in English. Some are restricted for use by [[Speech-Language Pathology#National approaches to speech and language pathology|speech and language professionals]] (therapists or SALTs in the UK, speech-language pathologists, SLPs, in the US and Australia).
A commonly used test battery for diagnosis of SLI is the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF). Assessments that can be completed by a parent or teacher can be useful to identify children who may require more in-depth evaluation.

The Grammar and Phonology Screening (GAPS) test is a quick (ten minute) simple and accurate screening test developed and standardized in the UK. It is suitable for children from 3;4 to 6;8 years;months and can be administered by professionals and non-professionals (including parents) alike,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gardner H, Froud K, McClelland A, van der Lely HK |title=Development of the Grammar and Phonology Screening (GAPS) test to assess key markers of specific language and literacy difficulties in young children |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=513–40 |year=2006 |pmid=17050469 |doi=10.1080/13682820500442644 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been demonstrated to be highly accurate (98% accuracy) in identifying impaired children who need specialist help vs non-impaired children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Lely HK, Payne E, McClelland A |title=An investigation to validate the grammar and phonology screening (GAPS) test to identify children with specific language impairment |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e22432 |year=2011 |pmid=21829461 |pmc=3145645 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022432 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it potentially a feasible test for widespread screening.

The Children’s Communication Checklist (CCC–2) is a parent questionnaire suitable for testing language skills in school-aged children.
Informal assessments, such as language samples, may also be used. This procedure is useful when the normative sample of a given test is inappropriate for a given child, for instance, if the child is bilingual and the sample was of monolingual children. It is also an ecologically valid measure of all aspects of language (e.g. semantics, syntax, pragmatics, etc.).

To complete a language sample, the SLP will spend about 15 minutes talking with the child. The sample may be of a conversation (Hadley, 1998), or narrative retell. In a narrative language sample, the SLP will tell the child a story using a wordless picture book (e.g. ''Frog Where Are You?'', Mayer, 1969), then ask the child to use the pictures and tell the story back.

Language samples are typically transcribed using computer software such as the systematic analysis of language software (SALT, Miller et al. 2012), and then analyzed. For example, the SLP might look for whether the child introduces characters to their story or jumps right in, whether the events follow a logical order, and whether the narrative includes a main idea or theme and supporting details.

==Prevalence==
Epidemiological surveys, in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomblin JB, Records NL, Buckwalter P, Zhang X, Smith E, O'Brien M |title=Prevalence of specific language impairment in kindergarten children |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1245–60 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9430746 |doi= 10.1044/jslhr.4006.1245|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Johnson CJ, Beitchman JH, Young A, etal |title=Fourteen-year follow-up of children with and without speech/language impairments: speech/language stability and outcomes |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=744–60 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10391637 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated the prevalence of SLI in five-year-olds at around 7%. However, neither study adopted the stringent "discrepancy" criteria of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] or [[ICD-10]]; SLI was diagnosed if the child scored below cut-off on standardized language tests, but had a nonverbal IQ of 90 or above and no other exclusionary criteria.

==Developmental course and outcome==
Longitudinal studies indicate that problems are largely resolved by five years in around 40% of 4-year-olds with SLI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV, Edmundson A |title=Language-impaired 4-year-olds: distinguishing transient from persistent impairment |journal=J Speech Hear Disord |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=156–73 |date=May 1987 |pmid=3573746 |doi= 10.1044/jshd.5202.156|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for children who still have significant language difficulties at school entry low levels of literacy are common, even for children who receive specialist help,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catts HW, Fey ME, Tomblin JB, Zhang X |title=A longitudinal investigation of reading outcomes in children with language impairments |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1142–57 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12546484 |doi= 10.1044/1092-4388(2002/093)|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and educational attainments are typically poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Snowling MJ, Adams JW, Bishop DV, Stothard SE |title=Educational attainments of school leavers with a preschool history of speech-language impairments |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=173–83 |year=2001 |pmid=11344593 |doi= 10.1080/13682820120976|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor outcomes are most common in cases where comprehension as well as expressive language is affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkin|first1=Z.|last2=Conti-Ramsden|first2=G.|title=Evidence of reading difficulty in subgroups of children with specific language impairment|journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy|volume=22|issue=3|year=2006|pages=315–331|issn=0265-6590|doi=10.1191/0265659006ct310xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that the nonverbal IQ of children with SLI decreases over the course of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Botting, N |title=Non-verbal cognitive development and language impairment |journal= Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=317–326 |date=March 2004 |pmid= 15755307|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00355.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SLI is associated with a high rate of [[psychiatric disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cohen, Nancy |title=Language impairment and psychopathology in infants, children, and adolescents |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-7619-2025-0 |oclc=45749780 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Conti-Ramsden and Botting (2004) found that 64% of a sample of 11-year-olds with SLI scored above a clinical threshold on a questionnaire for psychiatric difficulties, and 36% were regularly bullied, compared with 12% of comparison children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conti-Ramsden G, Botting N |title=Social difficulties and victimization in children with SLI at 11 years of age |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=145–61 |date=February 2004 |pmid=15072535 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2004/013) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the longer-term, studies of adult outcomes of children with SLI find elevated rates of unemployment, social isolation and psychiatric disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clegg J, Hollis C, Mawhood L, Rutter M |title=Developmental language disorders—a follow-up in later adult life. Cognitive, language and psychosocial outcomes |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=128–49 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15679523 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00342.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most studies focused on children with severe problems, where comprehension as well as expressive language was affected. Better outcomes are found for children who have milder difficulties and do not require special educational provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Snowling MJ, Bishop DV, Stothard SE, Chipchase B, Kaplan C |title=Psychosocial outcomes at 15 years of children with a preschool history of speech-language impairment |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=8 |pages=759–65 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16898989 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01631.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic and environmental risks==
It is now generally accepted that SLI is a strongly [[genetic disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV |title=What Causes Specific Language Impairment in Children? |journal=Curr Dir Psychol Sci |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=217–221 |date=October 2006 |pmid=19009045 |pmc=2582396 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00439.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best evidence comes from studies of twins. Two [[twins]] growing up together are exposed to the same home environment, yet may differ radically in their language skills. Such different outcomes are, however, seen almost exclusively in fraternal (non-identical) twins, who are genetically different. Identical twins share the same genes and tend to be much more similar in language ability.

There can be some variation in the severity and persistence of SLI in identical twins, indicating that environmental factors affect the course of disorder, but it is unusual to find a child with SLI who has an identical twin with normal language.

SLI is not usually caused by a [[mutation]] in a single gene.  Current evidence suggests that there are many different genes that can influence language learning, and SLI results when a child inherits a particularly detrimental combination of risk factors, each of which may have only a small effect.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2009). Genes, cognition and communication: insights from neurodevelopmental disorders. The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1156, 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized, however, that a mutation of the FOXP2 gene may have an influence on the development on SLI to a certain degree, as it regulates genes pertinent to neural pathways related to language.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Bishop, D. (2009). Genes, Cognition, and Communication: Insights from Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1156(1), 1–18. http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04419.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a handful of non-genetic factors have been found selectively to impact on [[language development]] in children. Later-born children in large families are at greater risk than earlier born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Garside, Roger F. |author2=Fundudis, Trian |author3=Kolvin, Israel |title=Speech retarded and deaf children : their psychological development |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-12-270150-X |oclc=6308388 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, genetic mutation, hereditary influences, and environmental factors may all have a role in the development and manifestation of SLI.  It is important, therefore, to not associate the development to a single factor, but recognize that it is oftentimes the result of complex interactions between any or all of these factors.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;

==Causal theories==
Much research has focused on trying to identify what makes language learning so hard for some children.  A major divide is between theories that attribute the difficulties to a low-level problem with auditory temporal processing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ceponiene R, Cummings A, Wulfeck B, Ballantyne A, Townsend J |title=Spectral vs. temporal auditory processing in specific language impairment: a developmental ERP study |journal=Brain Lang |volume=110 |issue=3 |pages=107–20 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19457549 |pmc=2731814 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2009.04.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tallal P |title=Improving language and literacy is a matter of time |journal=Nat.

==Associated factors==
Males are more affected by SLI than females. In clinical samples, the sex ratio of affected males: females is around 3 or 4:1.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, R. J. (1991). Causes and associations of severe and persistent specific speech and language disorders in children. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 33, 943–962.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this association is not known: no linkage has been found to [[genes]] on the [[sex chromosomes]].
Poor [[motor skills]] are commonly found in children with SLI.&lt;ref name="Hill EL 2001 149–71"/&gt; [[Brain scans]] do not usually reveal any obvious abnormalities in children with SLI, although quantitative comparisons have found differences in brain size or relative proportions of [[White matter|white]] or [[grey matter]] in specific regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jernigan TL, Hesselink JR, Sowell E, Tallal PA |title=Cerebral structure on magnetic resonance imaging in language- and learning-impaired children |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=539–45 |date=May 1991 |pmid=2021369 |doi= 10.1001/archneur.1991.00530170103028|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, unusual brain [[gyri]] are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson T, Plante E |title=Gyral morphology in the posterior Sylvian region in families affected by developmental language disorder |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=81–94 |date=June 1996 |pmid=8976499 |doi= 10.1007/bf01875369|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no consistent "neural signature" for SLI has been found.

==Intervention==
Intervention is usually carried out by speech and language therapists, who use a wide range of techniques to stimulate language learning. In the past, there was a vogue for drilling children in grammatical exercises, using [[imitation]] and [[data collection|elicitation]] methods, but such methods fell into disuse when it became apparent that there was little generalisation to everyday situations. Contemporary approaches to enhancing development of language structure are more likely to adopt 'milieu' methods, in which the intervention is interwoven into natural episodes of communication, and the therapist builds on the child's utterances, rather than dictating what will be talked about. In addition, there has been a move away from a focus solely on [[grammar]] and [[phonology]] toward [[Social Interaction Approach|interventions]] that develop children's social use of [[language]], often working in small groups that may include typically developing as well as language-impaired peers.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, T. (1996). Social-interactional approaches to child language intervention. In J. Beitchman, N. J. Cohen, M. M. Konstantareas &amp; R. Tannock (Eds.), Language, Learning and Behavior Disorders: Developmental, Biological and Clinical Perspectives (pp. 493–514). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in which modern approaches to remediation differ from the past is that parents are more likely to be directly involved, particularly with preschool children.&lt;ref&gt;Tannock, R., &amp; Girolametto, L. (1992). Reassessing parent-focused intervention programs. In S. F. Warren &amp; J. Reichle (Eds.), Causes and effects in communication and language intervention (pp. 49–81). Baltimore MD: Paul Brooks.&lt;/ref&gt;

A radically different approach has been developed by [[Paula Tallal|Tallal]] and colleagues, who have devised a computer-based intervention, [[Fast Forword]], that involves prolonged and intensive training on specific components of language and auditory processing.&lt;ref&gt;Tallal, P. (2000). Experimental studies of language learning impairments: From research to remediation. In D. V. M. Bishop &amp; L. B. Leonard (Eds.), Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, Characteristics, Intervention and Outcome (pp. 131–155). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory underlying this approach maintains that language difficulties are caused by a failure to make fine-grained auditory discriminations in the temporal dimension, and the computerised training materials are designed to sharpen perceptual acuity.

For all these types of intervention, there are few adequately controlled trials that allow one to assess clinical efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Law J, Garrett Z, Nye C |title=The efficacy of treatment for children with developmental speech and language delay/disorder: a meta-analysis |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=924–43 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15324296 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2004/069) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, where studies have been done, results have been disappointing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glogowska M, Roulstone S, Enderby P, Peters TJ |title=Randomised controlled trial of community based speech and language therapy in preschool children |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7266 |pages=923–6 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11030677 |pmc=27499 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7266.923|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some more positive outcomes have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Bryne-Saricks, M.

J: Ablex Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a systematic review of clinical trials assessing the FastForword approach was published, and reported no significant gains relative to a control group.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, G.

A '''speech corpus''' (or '''spoken corpus''') is a [[database]] of speech audio files and text [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcriptions]].
In [[speech technology]], speech corpora are used, among other things, to create [[acoustic model]]s (which can then be used with a [[speech recognition]] engine). 
In [[linguistics]], spoken corpora are used to do research into [[phonetic]], [[conversation analysis]], [[dialectology]] and other fields.

A corpus is one such database.  Corpora is the plural of corpus (i.e. it is many such databases).

There are two types of Speech Corpora:

# Read Speech – which includes:
#* Book excerpts
#* Broadcast news
#* Lists of words
#* Sequences of numbers
# Spontaneous Speech – which includes:
#* Dialogs – between two or more people (includes meetings);
#* Narratives – a person telling a story (one such corpus is the [[Buckeye Corpus]]);
#* Map-tasks –  one person explains a route on a map to another;
#* Appointment-tasks – two people try to find a common meeting time based on individual schedules.

A special kind of speech corpora are [[non-native speech databases]] that contain speech with foreign accent.

[[File:Sword Guard LACMA M.80.219.1.jpg|thumb|[[Openwork]] or ''sukashibori'' [[tsuba]] or sword guard]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Sukashibori'''''|透彫(すかしぼり)}} is the Japanese term for [[openwork]] or pierced work, using various techniques in [[metalworking]] and other media, in which the foreground design is left intact, while background areas are cut away and removed (or the converse may be performed).&lt;ref name=tma&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Tokyo National Museum|title=和英対照日本美術鑑賞の手引(An Aid to the Understanding of Japanese Art)|year=1976|pages=132/133}} (revised edition; 1964 first ed.), p.132/133&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting piece becomes see-through (''sukashi'') and hence the name.

Traditional artisans worked on piece of cast metal (or hammered metal&lt;ref name=tma/&gt;) such as bronze as medium. In traditional metalworking (''chōkin'', {{Nihongo|彫金}}), the carving tools they used were the '''piercing [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]''' (''sukashi-tagane'', {{Nihongo|透かし鏨}})&lt;ref name=tma/&gt; and '''[[scroll saw]]''' (''tsurubiki-noko''(?), {{Nihongo|弦引鋸}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tokyo National Museum|1964}}, p. 132. 「弦引鋸」is the word used here for the scroll saw, but no other instance of the word can be found in other sources, and the reading of the word is a guess. it may be ''tsuruhiki nokogiri'', for instance&lt;/ref&gt;

The type where the foreground pattern is preserved and the background removed is called {{Nihongo|'''''ji-sukashi'''''|地透し}},&lt;ref name=tma/&gt; and the reverse is called {{Nihongo|'''''moyō-sukashi'''''|文様透し}}.&lt;ref name=tma/&gt;

In Buddhist art, {{Nihongo|{{Interlanguage link multi|foliage scroll|ja|3=唐草模様|lt=foliage scrollwork|vertical-align=sup}}|唐草模様|karakusa-moyō}} or lotus motif is often used&lt;ref name=shincho&gt;{{cite book|author=Shinchosha|title=新潮世界美術事典 (Shincho Encyclopedia of World Art)|year=1985 |publisher=Shinchosha|isbn=4-10-730206-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is an [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]]-like or lacework-like design. They are featured in the depiction of the ''kōhai'' or "rear glow" (the halo or nimbus behind Buddhist statues)&lt;ref name=shincho/&gt; as well as the tiara-like headpieces &lt;ref name=shincho/&gt; crowning their heads. Other prominent uses are in ritual objects such as ''[[keman]]'' (pendent ornaments),&lt;ref name=shincho/&gt; {{Nihongo|''{{Interlanguage link multi|keko (Buddhist object)|ja|3=唐草模様|lt=keko|vertical-align=sup}}''|華籠|"flower basket"}},&lt;ref name=shincho/&gt; and {{Nihongo|[[Koro (incense burner)|kōro]]|香炉|incense burners}}.&lt;ref name=shincho/&gt; Examples of [[tsuba]] (hilt-guard) of the Japanese sword often use ''sukashibori'' work.

The word is also applied when used for other material, such a wood; for example, the [[transom (architectural)|transom]] (''ranma'') may be done in ''sukashibori'' work.&lt;ref name=shincho/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2065">[[File:Szymanski routing.svg|thumb|Routing a permutation of the doubly-directed [[cube graph]]]]
In mathematics, '''Szymanski's conjecture''', named after {{harvs|first=Ted H.|last=Szymanski|year=1989|txt}}, states that every [[permutation]] on the ''n''-dimensional doubly [[directed graph|directed]] [[hypercube graph]] can be routed with edge-disjoint [[Path (graph theory)|paths]]. That is, if the permutation σ matches each vertex ''v'' to another vertex σ(''v''), then for each ''v'' there exists a path in the hypercube graph from ''v'' to σ(''v'') such that no two paths for two different vertices ''u'' and ''v'' use the same edge in the same direction.

Through computer experiments it has been verified that the conjecture is true for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;4 {{harv|Baudon|Fertin|Havel|2001}}. Although the conjecture remains open for ''n'' ≥ 5, in this case there exist permutations that require the use of paths that are not [[shortest path]]s in order to be routed {{harv|Lubiw|1990}}.

'''Tim Saunders''' is a [[Cornish language]] poet who also writes poetry and journalism in the [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] languages. He is resident in Cardiff but is of Cornish descent. He is a bard of the [[Gorseth Kernow]], a literary historian and editor of 'The Wheel' – an anthology of modern poetry in Cornish 1850–1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francisboutle.co.uk/booklist/hightide/rvhigh.htm Tim Saunders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908025053/http://www.francisboutle.co.uk/booklist/hightide/rvhigh.htm |date=2007-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402104359/http://www.molossus.co/poetry/3-cornish-poems/ » 3 Cornish Poems »]&lt;/ref&gt; ''High Tide'' is a collection of his own poems in Cornish from the years 1974 to 1999.

Tim’s daughters, [[Gwenno Saunders|Gwenno]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celticcafe.com/archive/Music/Gwenno/ Gwenno at the Celtic Cafe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://womad.org/artists/gwenno/ Gwenno » Artists » WOMAD] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120723205654/http://womad.org/artists/gwenno/ |date=2012-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ani Saunders]], were formerly [[singer]]s with the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[indie pop]] [[girl group]] [[The Pipettes]], with Gwenno also playing the [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], and are now solo artists.

==Standard Written Form==
Saunders has spoken out against the development of a [[Standard Written Form]] of Cornish, saying, "The insulting notion that we are so stupid as to need 'impartial outside experts' to settle our differences is, quite simply, contemptible. Such transparent chicanery would require scholars having limited acquaintance with the Cornish-speaking community, and no accountability, to lay down the law for it. No reputable academic would destroy his or her own reputation by taking up such a patronizing stance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://kk.kaskyrgh.cymru247.net/kampoell.html Kaskyrgh Kernewek Kemmyn : Campaign for Common Cornish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202125313/http://kk.kaskyrgh.cymru247.net/kampoell.html |date=2011-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79898">The '''grammar of the [[Ukrainian language]]''' describes the phonological, morphological, and syntactical rules of the Ukrainian language. Ukrainian contains 7 cases and 2 numbers for its nominal declension and 2 aspects, 3 tenses, 3 moods, and 2 voices for its verbal conjugation. Adjectives must agree in number, gender, and case with their nouns.

In order to understand Ukrainian grammar, it is necessary to understand the various phonological rules that occur due to the collision of two or more sounds. Doing so markedly decreases the number of exceptions and makes understanding the rules better. The origin of some of these phonological rules can be traced all the way back to Indo-European gradation ([[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]). This is especially common in explaining the differences between the infinitive and present stem of many verbs.

This article presents the grammar of the literary language, which is followed by most dialects. The main differences in the dialects are vocabulary with occasional differences in phonology and morphology. Further information can be found in the article [[Ukrainian dialects]].

==Phonology==
The following points of Ukrainian phonology need to be considered in order to properly understand the grammar of Ukrainian.

===Classification of vowels===
Two different classifications of [[vowel]]s can be made: a historical perspective and a modern perspective. From a historical perspective, the Ukrainian vowels can be divided into two categories:
# Hard vowels (in Cyrillic: а, и (from Common Slavic *ы), о, and у or transliterated as ''a, y (from Common Slavic *y), o,'' and ''u''; )
# Soft vowels (in Cyrillic: е, і and и (from Common Slavic *и) or transliterated as ''e, i'' and ''y (from Common Slavic *i)'').  The [[iotified vowel]]s are considered to be soft vowels
From a modern perspective, the Ukrainian vowels can be divided into two categories:
# Hard Vowels (In Cyrillic: а, е, и, і, о, and у or transliterated as ''a, e, y, i, o,'' and ''u''). This category as can be seen from the table is different from the historical hard category
# Iotified Vowel (In Cyrillic: я, є, ї, and ю or transliterated as ''ja, je, ji,'' and ''ju''). To this category can also be added the combination of letters йо/ьо (transliterated as ''jo'')

===Classification of consonants===
In Ukrainian, [[consonant]]s can be categorised as follows:
* '''Labials''' (in Cyrillic: б, в, м, п, and ф or transliterated as ''b, v, m, p,'' and ''f'') are almost always hard in Ukrainian (there are orthographic exceptions), can never be doubled or in general be followed by an [[iotified vowel]] (exception: in combinations ''CL'' where ''C'' is a [[dental consonant|dental]] and ''L'' is a [[labial consonant|labial]], a soft vowel can follow, e.g., svjato/свято).
* '''Post-alveolar sibilants''' (in Cyrillic: ж, ч, and ш or transliterated as ''ž, č,'' and ''š''. The digraph щ (''šč'') should also be included) were in Common Slavic all [[palatal]] (soft). They hardened in Ukrainian, leading to the creation of the mixed [[declension]] of nouns. They can't be followed by a soft sign (in Cyrillic: ь; transliterated as apostrophe (’)) or any iotified vowel. All but the digraph щ can be doubled, in which case they can be followed by a soft vowel, e.g., ''zbižžja''/збіжжя.
* '''Dentals''' (in Cyrillic: д, з, л, н, с, т and ц or transliterated as ''d, z, l, n, s, t,'' and ''c'') can be both hard and soft in Ukrainian, as in Common Slavic. These letters can never (unless they are the last letter in a prefix) be followed by an apostrophe. Furthermore, these letters can be doubled.
* '''Alveolar''' (in Cyrillic: р or transliterated as ''r'') can be either hard or soft but is always hard at the end of a syllable. Therefore, ''r'' is always hard at the end of a word and is never followed by a soft sign. ''r'' can never be doubled, except in foreign words (such as сюрреалізм).
* '''Velars''' (in Cyrillic: г, ґ, к, and х or transliterated as ''h, g, k,'' and ''x'') are always hard in both Ukrainian and Common Slavic. If an iotified or soft vowel are to follow them, they undergo the first and second palatalisations. Hence, these letters can never be doubled or followed by an apostrophe.

===Historical changes===
In the Ukrainian language, the following sound changes have occurred between the [[Proto-Slavic|Common Slavic]] period and current Ukrainian:

# In a newly closed [[syllable]], that is, a syllable that ends in a [[consonant]], Common Slavic ''o'' and ''e'' mutate into ''i'' if the next [[vowel]] in Common Slavic was one of the [[yer]]s (''ǐ'' (ь) or ''ǔ'' (ъ)).
# [[Pleophony]]: The Common Slavic combinations, ''ToRT'' and ''TeRT'', where ''T'' is any consonant and ''R'' is either ''r'' or ''l'' become in Ukrainian
## ''TorT'' gives ''ToroT'' (Common Slavic ''*borda'' gives Ukrainian ''boroda'')
## ''TolT'' gives ''ToloT'' (Common Slavic ''*bolto'' gives Ukrainian ''boloto'')
## ''TerT'' gives ''TereT'' (Common Slavic ''*berza'' gives Ukrainian ''bereza'')
## ''TelT'' gives ''ToloT'' (Common Slavic ''*melko'' gives Ukrainian ''moloko'')
# The Common Slavic nasal vowel ''ę'' is reflected as ''ja'' except after a single [[labial consonant|labial]] where it is reflected as ''″ja'' (’я), or after a [[post-alveolar]] sibilant where it is reflected as ''a.'' Examples: Common Slavic ''*pętĭ'' gives in Ukrainian ''p″jat''' (п’ять); Common Slavic ''*telę'' gives in Ukrainian ''telja''; and Common Slavic ''kurčę'' gives in Ukrainian ''kurča.'' This Common Slavic nasal vowel is derived from an Indo-European ''*-en'', ''*-em'', or one of the [[sonant]]s ''n'' and ''m''.
# The Common Slavic letter, ''ě'' (ѣ), is reflected in Ukrainian generally as ''i'' except:
## word-initially, where it is reflected as ''ji'': Common Slavic ''*ěsti'' gives the Ukrainian ''jisty''
## after the post-alveolar sibilants where it is reflected as ''a'': Common Slavic ''*ležěti'' gives the Ukrainian ''ležaty''
# Common Slavic ''i'' and ''y'' are both reflected in Ukrainian as ''y''
# The Common Slavic combination ''-CǐjV'', where ''C'' is any consonant and ''V'' is any vowel, becomes in Ukrainian the following combination ''-CCjV'', except
## if ''C'' is labial or 'r' where it becomes ''-C"jV''
## if ''V'' is the Common Slavic ''e'', then the vowel in Ukrainian mutates to ''a'', e.g., Common Slavic ''*žitĭje'' gives the Ukrainian ''žyttja''
## if ''V'' is the Common Slavic ''ĭ'', then the combination becomes ''ej'', e.g., genitive plural in Common Slavic ''*myšĭjĭ'' give in Ukrainian ''myšej''
## if one or more consonants precede the 'C' then there is no doubling of the consonants in Ukrainian
# Common Slavic combinations ''dl'' and ''tl'' are simplified to ''l'', for example, Common Slavic ''*mydlo'' gives Ukrainian ''mylo''
# Common Slavic ''ǔl'' ([[voiced]] ''l̥'') and ''ǐl'' (voiced ''ĺ̥'') became ''ov'', while word final ''*lǔ'' became ''v''. For example, Common Slavic ''*vĺ̥kǔ'' becomes ''vovk'' in Ukrainian

===Current changes===
# The first [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] concerns the [[velars]] and the following vowels: ''e,'' ''y'' from Common Slavic ''i'', ''a/i'' from Common Slavic ''ě'', derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] ''ē''. Before these vowels,
## ''h''/''g'' mutates into ''ž''.
## ''k'' mutates into ''č''.
## ''x'' mutates into ''š''.
# The second palatalisation concerns the velars and the following vowels: ''y'' from Common Slavic ''i'' that is derived from an Indo-European diphthong and ''a/i'' from Common Slavic ''ě'', derived from an Indo-European diphthong. Before these vowels,
## ''h''/''g'' mutates into ''z''.
## ''k'' mutates into ''c''.
## ''x'' mutates into ''s''.
# The [[iotification]] concerns all consonants and the semi-vowel ''j'' (й). The following changes occur:
## The [[labial consonant|labials]] insert an ''l'' between the labial and the [[semivowel]]: Common Slavic ''*zemja'' give Ukrainian ''zemlja''.
## The velars followed by a semivowel mutate as in the first palatalisation. The semivowel is dropped. This change can be traced back to Common Slavic.
## ''ktj'', ''tj'' becomes ''č''
## ''dj'' becomes ''ž'', except in verbs where it becomes ''dž''
## ''sj'' becomes ''š''
## ''stj'', ''skj'' become ''šč'' (щ)
## ''zdj'', ''zhj'' become ''ždž''
## ''zkj'' becomes ''žč''
## ''l, n, r'' becomes ''lj, nj, rj'' (that is, ''ль, нь, рь'')
# In Ukrainian, when two or more consonants occur word-finally, then a float vowel is inserted under the following conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = A Guide to the Declension of Nouns in Ukrainian |first= T. R. |last=Carlton
|publisher = University of Alberta Press|location= Edmonton, Alberta, Canada |year = 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a consonantal grouping ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(ь)C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(ь)'', where ''C'' is any Ukrainian consonant. The fill vowel is inserted between the two consonants and after the ''ь''. A fill vowel is only inserted if ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is one of the following consonants: ''k, v, l, m, r, n,'' and ''c''. In this case:
## If ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is one of the following ''h, k,'' or ''x'', then the fill vowel is always ''o''
## If ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''k'' or ''v'', then the fill vowel is ''o''. No fill vowel is inserted if the ''v'' is derived from a [[voiced]] ''l'', for example, ''vovk''
## If ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''l, m, r,'' or ''c'', then the fill vowel is ''e''
## The only known exception is ''vid′om'', which should take ''e'' as the fill vowel, but instead adds an ''o''.
## The combinations, ''-stv'' and ''-s′k'' are not broken up
## If the ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''j'' (й), then the above rules can apply. However, both forms (with and without the fill vowel) often exist

===Assimilation===
The following [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilations]] occur:
*Before the с of a suffix (-ський or -ство)
**If the root ends in г(ґ), ж, or з, then it mutates to з and the с of the suffix is lost.
**If the root ends in к, ч, or ц, then it mutates to ц and the с of the suffix is lost.
**If the root ends in х, с, or ш, then it mutates to с and the с of the suffix is lost (or the last letter of the root drops out).
*The following combinations of letters change:
**{ж, з} + дн is contracted to {ж, з} + н.
**ст + {л, н} is contracted to с + {л, н}.
**{п, р} + тн is contracted to {п, р} + н.
**{с, к} + кн is contracted to {с, к} + н.

===Dissimilation===
The most common [[dissimilation]] is encountered in the infinitive of verbs, where {д, т} + т dissimilates to ст, for example, крад + ти gives красти and плет + ти gives плести.

==Morphology==

===Nominal===

====Nouns====
The nominal [[declension]] has seven [[declension|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], and [[vocative]]), in two numbers ([[Grammatical number|singular]] and [[plural]]), and absolutely obeying [[grammatical gender]] (masculine, feminine and neuter). Adjectives, pronouns, and the first two cardinal numbers have gender specific forms.

A third number, the [[Dual grammatical number|dual]], also existed in [[Old Ruthenian|Old East Slavic]], but except for its use in the nominative and accusative cases with the numbers two, three and four, e.g. '''dvi hryvni'''/'''дві гривні''' vs. '''dvoje hryven' '''/'''двоє гривень''' (recategorised today as a nominative plural), it has been lost. Other traces of the dual can be found when referring to objects of which are commonly in pairs: eyes, shoulders, ears, ''e.g.'' ''plečyma''. Occasionally, dual forms can distinguish between meanings.

In Ukrainian, there are 4 declension types. The first declension is used for most feminine nouns. The second declension is used for most masculine and neuter nouns. The third declension is used for feminine nouns ending in '''ь''' or a post-alveolar sibilant. The fourth declension is used for neuter nouns ending in '''я/а''' (Common Slavic ''*ę'').

Most of the types consist of 3 different subgroups: hard, mixed, and soft. The soft subgroup consists of nouns whose roots end in a soft letter (followed by iotified vowel or soft vowel). The mixed subgroup consists of the nouns whose roots end in a post-alveolar sibilant or occasionally ''r''. The hard group consists of all other nouns.

If the hard group endings are taken as the basis, then the following rules can be used to derive the corresponding mixed and soft endings:
*Mixed subgroup: Following a post-alveolar sibilant,,
*# All о change to е.
*# All и  change to і.
*Soft subgroup: Whenever a soft sign or the semi-vowel encounters the vowel of the ending, the following changes occur (These are mainly orthographic changes, but same can be traced to similar changes in Common Slavic):
*# ьа and йа gives я
*# ьо gives е
*# йе gives є
*# ьи gives і
*# йи gives ї
*# ьу and йу gives ю
*# ьі  gives і
*# йі gives ї

Nouns ending in a consonant are marked in the following tables with ∅ (no ending).

=====First declension=====

This declension consists of nouns that end in а or я. It consists primarily of feminine nouns, but a few nouns with these ending referring to professions can be either masculine or feminine. In these cases, the genitive plural is often formed by adding -ів. Nouns referring to people can also take this ending.

*(1) A velar consonant undergoes the appropriate second palatalisation changes
*(2) If two or more consonants are left at the end of the word, then a fill vowel may be inserted.
*(3) The genitive form is used for all animate nouns, while inanimate nouns take the nominative form.
&lt;!--*(4) Some words end in "ю". I do not believe there are any such nouns. The official Ukrainian orthography does not admit of such endings. --&gt;

=====Second declension=====
The second declension consists of masculine and neuter nouns.

'''Masculine nouns''': This group consists primarily of nouns ending in a consonant, a soft sign ь, or й. In this declension, nouns ending in р can belong to any of the three declension subgroups: hard, mixed, and soft. There is no way of knowing from the nominative form, to which group the noun belongs.

|}
                   
Notes:
*(1) Only with soft nouns ending in р.
*(2) The ending to be used depends on the nature of the noun. The following rules are given in '''Ukrainian Orthography''':&lt;ref name=orthography&gt;{{cite book|title = Український Правопис
|edition = 4th|publisher = Наукова думка (Naukova Dumka)|location= Kiev, Ukraine|year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Use the ending -а with
**# Names of professions, people’s names (first and last)
**# Names of plants and animals
**# Names of objects
**# Names of settlements and geographic places
**# Names of measuring units
**# Names of machines
**# Words of foreign origin, which describe geometric parts, concrete objects.
**Use the ending -у with
**# Chemical elements, materials (note a few exceptions)
**# Collective nouns
**# Names of buildings and their parts
**# Names of organisations and their places
**# Natural phenomena
**# Feelings
**# Names of processes, states, phenomena of social life (both concrete and abstract)
**# Names of foreign origin that denote physical or chemical processes
**# Names of games and dances
*(3) The ending in -ові is preferred.
*(4) The accusative case for animate nouns is identical to the genitive case; for inanimate nouns, it is identical to the nominative.
*(5) In order to avoid the palatalisation, velar root nouns take the -у ending. The other forms are all acceptable. Nouns that take the -і ending undergo the first palatalisation.
*(6) If the ending -е is used, then the first palatalisation occurs. However, it can be avoided by using the -у form.
*(7) The second ending occurs is a small group of nouns.
*(8) The genitive form is used with animate objects, while inanimate objects take the nominative forms.

'''Neuter nouns''':
This category consists of neuter nouns ending in о, е, and substantives ending in я, preceded by either a double consonant, apostrophe, or two consonants, which primarily are derived from verbs. This last category once did end in ''*ĭjе'', but due to the sound change given above developed an я ending.

*(1) As necessary, the second palatalisation occurs, except for the ''*ĭjе'' nouns.
*(2) The double consonant is made single if the ь is used. However, if a post-alveolar sibilant is the last consonant, then no ь is used, but a single consonant is also written. For a labial final consonant, the ending is -’їв. Finally, monosyllabic nouns take the ending -ів. If two or more consonants appear word finally, then it is possible that a fill vowel must be inserted.

=====Third declension=====
This declension consists solely of feminine nouns that end in a consonant. This declension has only 2 subgroups: a mixed and soft group.

{| align=center class="wikitable"

*(1) Since this ending is derived from the Common Slavic ending ''*-ĭjǫ'', doubling of the consonant occurs as per the rules outlined above. Furthermore, if in the nominative form the noun has an -і for an -о, then so will the instrumental form, for example, ніччю (instrumental singular) and ніч (nominative singular)

=====Fourth declension=====
This declension consists of solely neuter nouns that are derived from Common Slavic ''*ę''. There are two subgroups: those with an н insert, and those with a т insert.

====Adjectives====
Ukrainian adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case.

In Ukrainian, there exist a small number of adjectives, primarily possessives, which exist in the masculine in the so-called ''short'' form. This "short" form is a relic of the indefinite declension of adjectives in Common Slavic. Common examples of this anomalous declension are ''бабин'' (masculine) compared to ''бабина'' (feminine); ''братів'' (masculine) compared to ''братова'' (feminine); and ''повинен'' (masculine) compared to ''повинна''. This ''short'' form only exists in the masculine nominative form. All other forms are regular.

=====Declension=====
In Ukrainian, there are 2 different declension types: hard and soft. The soft type can be further subdivided into two types. Unlike for the nouns, the post-alveolar sibilants are counted as hard. There also exists a special mixed declension for adjectives ending in -лиций. These adjectives are derived from the noun лице, describing types of faces, for example, білолиций.

Note about the declensions:

*(1) In the accusative case (except the feminine singular), a difference is made between animate (=genitive) and inanimate (=nominative) adjectives.
*(2) The ending in ''-ому'' is more often encountered. The other form is a relic of the indefinite declension of adjectives in Common Slavic.

=====Other forms of the adjective=====
In Ukrainian adjectives also have a comparative and superlative forms.

The [[Comparison (grammar)|comparative]] form is created by dropping ''ий'' and adding the ending ''-(і)ший''. The resulting form is declined like a regular hard stem adjective. As usual, some adjectives have irregular forms.

The [[superlative]] form is created by prefixing ''най-'' to the comparative form. Words associated with religion often prefix ''пре-'' (very) to the comparative form. As usual, some adjectives have irregular forms.

====Adverbs====
In Ukrainian, [[adverbs]] are formed by taking the stem of the adjective (that is dropping the ''−а'' from the feminine nominative singular form; forms ending in −я are replaced by ''−ьа'' (after consonants) or ''−йа'' (after vowels), before dropping the ''−а''.) and adding the ending
* ''-о'', is the general ending,
* ''-е'', can be used for some stems that are hard (no ь or й at the end), for example, ''добре'' from ''добрий''. This is very common for the comparative form of the adjective.

For example, ''гарний'' gives ''гарно''. The comparative and superlative forms of an adverb are formed by taking the corresponding form of the adjective and replacing ''−ий'' by ''-е'', for example, ''гарніше'' from ''гарніший''.

Adverbs can also be derived from the locative or instrumental singular of a noun, for example, ''ввечері'' (from в plus the locative of вечера), ''нагорі'' (from на plus the locative of гора).

====Pronouns====

Comments:
*(1) Any soft signs are dropped if they occur word finally in the original cardinal number.
*(2) This is a dual construction.
*(3) This is a plural nominative construction.
*(4) This is the genitive plural construction (All hundreds after 500 are so created.).

In general, the following rules are used to determine agreement between the cardinal number and a noun. In the nominative case, the nouns agree with the last number in any compound number. Nouns that must agree with a number ending in 2, 3, or 4 are in the nominative plural, but retain the stress of the dual, that is the genitive singular. Nouns, which must agree with a number ending in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, and all the teens are in the genitive plural. In any other case, the nouns and numbers are in the same case.

===Verbs===
[[Grammatical conjugation]] is subject to three [[Grammatical person|persons]] in two numbers and three simple [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] (present/future, future, and past), with [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] forms for the future and [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], as well as [[Imperative mood|imperative]] forms and present/past [[participle]]s, distinguished by [[adjective|adjectival]] and [[adverb]]ial usage.  There are two [[grammatical voice|voices]], [[active voice|active]] and [[middle voice|middle]]/[[passive voice|passive]], which is constructed by the addition of a reflexive [[suffix]] '''-ся/сь''' to the active form.  An interesting feature is that the past tense is actually made to agree in gender with the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], for it is the [[participle]] in an originally periphrastic [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] formed with the present of '''быть''' (modern: '''бути''') {{IPA|/bɨtʲ/}},"to be." Verbal inflection today is considerably simpler than in Common Slavic. The ancient [[aorist]], [[imperfect]], and (periphrastic) [[pluperfect]] have been lost. The loss of three of the former six tenses has been offset by the reliance, as in other Slavic languages, on verbal [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].  Most verbs come in pairs, one with [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] or continuous connotation, the other with [[perfective aspect|perfective]] or completed, usually formed with a (prepositional) prefix, but occasionally using a different root.

The present tense of the verb '''бути''', "[[copula (linguistics)|to be]]", today normally has the form, ''є'' used for all persons and numbers. Previously (before 1500) and occasionally in liturgical settings, aspects of the full conjugation, can be found. The paradigm shows as well as anything else the Indo-European affinity of Ukrainian:

{| class="wikitable"
!English
!Ukrainian
!IPA
!Latin
![[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]]
|-
|"I am"||я єсьми*||{{IPA|/(je)smɪ/}}||sum||''éǵh₂om H₁ésmi''
|-
|"you are" (sing.)||ти єси ||{{IPA|/(je)sɪ/}}|| es||''túh₂ H₁ési''
|-

|-
|"they are"||вони суть* ||{{IPA|/sutʲ/}}||sunt||''tō H₁sónti''
|}

Note: Ukrainian forms followed by * are considered archaic in Standard Ukrainian (albeit those are still used in dialects) and are replaced by є. In the present tense, the verb '''бути''' is often omitted (or replaced by a dash "—" in writing), for example, Я — студент.

====Classification of verbs====
There exist two different classification of verbs: traditional and historical/linguistic.

The traditional classification of verbs subdivides the verbs into two categories based on the form of the 3rd person singular present indicative form of the verb.
# The ''е'' stems, which have the ending ''-е'' or ''-є'' in the 3rd person singular.
# The ''и'' stems, which have the ending ''-ить'' in the 3rd person singular.

The historical/linguistic classification of verbs subdivides the verbs into 5 categories. Classes 1,2 and 3 correspond to the ''е'' stems of the traditional classification, while class 4 corresponds to the ''и'' stems. Class 5 consists of the athematic verbs.&lt;ref&gt;

# Class 1: Stems in ''-е''
#* The same stem in the Present and the Infinitive
#** The same consonantal stem (the last three examples do not quite resemble the first example or the classification name due to various sound changes (palatalisation) in Ukrainian):
#***нести / несе

#** The same vowel stem
#***плисти / пливе
#* Infinitive in ''-ати''

# Class 2: "n" verbs (mostly perfective verbs)
#* двигнути / двигне
# Class 3: Presents in ''є'' (undergo changes associated with iotification)
#* Primary verbs
#** Same stem in the Present and Infinitive
#*** Same vowel stem
#**** знати / знає
#*** Same consonantal stem (these stem often have a pleophonic form for the infinitive)

#**лежати / лежить
# Class 5: Athematic Verbs (''-m'' presents)
#* їсти
#* дати
#* -вісти
#* бути

====Voices====
Ukrainian had 2 voices: (1) [[active voice]] and (2) [[passive voice]]. The active voice is the only voice with a complete set of conjugations. The active voice, in general, shows a direct effect of the verb on its subject.

====Indicative active mood====
The [[indicative mood]] is used to describe events, which have occurred, are occurring, or will occur. In Ukrainian, the indicative mood contains the present, future, and past tenses.

=====Present tense=====
Historically, this is derived from the Indo-European present tense. In Common Slavic and later Ukrainian, it retained its present meaning only for imperfective verbs and developed a future meaning for perfective verbs.

For the ''е'' stems (Classes 1, 2, and 3), the endings are:

{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ '''е stem endings'''
! 
! singular
! plural
|-
| '''First Person''' || -у / -ю || -емо / -ємо 
|-
| '''Second Person''' || -еш / -єш ||-ете / -єте 
|-
| '''Third Person''' || -е / -є || -уть / -ють
|}

All verbs whose roots end in a velar undergo the first palatalisation in all forms of the present (even though historically speaking the first person singular should not). The endings in ''є'' are used for roots whose stem ends in a vowel. All verbs in Class 3 and those that end in a vowel use ''-ю'' and ''-ють''. Furthermore, Class 3 verbs undergo iotification in those forms that use ''-ю-''. For reflexive verbs, in the third person singular, the ending has its historical ''-ть'' restored before the participle ''-ся / -сь'' is affixed. Thus, the ending becomes ''-еться''.

For the ''и'' stems (Class 4), the endings are:

{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ '''и stem endings'''
! 
! singular
! plural
|-
| '''First Person''' ||  -ю / (-у) || -имо / -їмо 
|-
| '''Second Person''' || -иш / -їш ||-ите / -їте 
|-
| '''Third Person''' || -ить / -їть || -ать / -ять
|}

All Class 4 verbs undergo iotification in the first person singular. Thus, there is really only one ending, which due to orthographic reasons is given 2 different forms. Verbs ending in a vowel take the endings in the second column. In the third person plural, verbs ending in a labial insert an ''л'' before the ending, ''-ять''. The ending ''-ать'' is used after the sibilants ''ж, ш, щ'', or ''ч''.

======[[Athematic verb]]s======
Ukrainian inherited from Indo-European through Common Slavic, the following 3 athematic verbs. These verbs have their own conjugation in the present. Everywhere else they are regular.

{| class="wikitable" align="center"

!

|-
| '''First Person''' || -вім || -вімо 
|-
| '''Second Person''' || -віси ||-вісте 
|-
| '''Third Person''' || -вість || -відять
|}

=====Past active tense=====
The past tense in Ukrainian has the peculiarity of being originally an adjective, since it derives from the original compound perfect (corresponding to, for example, the [[Latin grammar|Latin]] first conjugation participle ending ''-atus''). Thus, the past tense agrees in number and gender with the subject of the verb. The following endings are added to the infinitive with the ending ''-ти'' removed (Most root final ''д'' and ''т'' are dropped):

*masculine singular: ''-в''
**Note: It is lost after ''с, з, к, г, б, р''.
**Note 2: Stems ending in ''е'' or ''о'' plus a consonant convert them to ''і'', for example, ''ніс'' but ''несла'' and ''міг'' but ''могла''. Stems in ''я'' plus a consonant can also undergo this change.
*feminine singular: ''-ла''
*neuter singular: ''-ло''
*plural: ''-ли''

Class 2 verbs can have forms without the −ну, for example, ''заслабнути'' has the forms ''заслаб'', ''заслабла'', ''заслабло'', and ''заслабли''. Not all Class 2 verbs undergo this change.

These forms are often called the active past participle I. The masculine singular evolved from an earlier *-лъ that delingualized (cf. [[Polish language|Polish]] ''-ł'').

=====Future active tense=====
In Ukrainian, there are 2 different future tenses for imperfective verbs. The first form, called ''simple'' (''проста форма''), formed by adding to the infinitive of the verb the following endings, which are derived from the Common Slavic verb ''*jęti'' (Present stem: jĭm−):

{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ ''' Future Tense: First Form'''
! 
! colspan="2" |singular
! colspan="2" |plural
|-
| || Ending || Example || Ending || Example
|-
| '''First Person''' ||  -му ||їстиму|| -мемо || їстимемо
|-
| '''Second Person''' || -меш || їстимеш ||-мете || їстимете 
|-
| '''Third Person''' || -ме || їстиме ||  -муть || їстимуть
|}

The second form, called ''compound'' (''складена форма''), is to take the present tense conjugation of the verb ''бути'' and use it with the infinitive of the verb. Thus,

{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ '''Future Tense: Second Form'''
! 
! singular
! plural
|-
| '''First Person''' ||  буду їсти|| будемо їсти
|-
| '''Second Person''' || будеш їсти || будете їсти 
|-
| '''Third Person''' || буде їсти || будуть їсти
|}

This will translate as ''will eat'' with the appropriate personal pronoun.

====Imperative active mood====
The [[imperative mood]] is used to give commands. It exists in only the present tense in Ukrainian. There are no forms for the 1st person singular. 
In Ukrainian, the imperative mood is formed from the present stem of the verb plus the following endings (The example is based on Ukrainian ''пити''):

{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ '''Imperative Mood in Ukrainian'''
! 
! singular
! plural
|-
| '''First Person''' || ''none'' || -ьмо / -ймо / -мо / -імо (пиймо)
|-
| '''Second Person''' || -ь / -й / ∅ / -и (пий) ||-ьте / -йте / -те / -іть (пийте) 
|-
| '''Third Person''' || хай or нехай + 3rd person present singular (хай п'є or нехай п'є)  ||хай or нехай + 3rd person present plural (хай п'ють or нехай п'ють)
|}

The first set of endings is to be used for stems that end in a dentals (''з, д, т, с, н,'' and ''л''). The second set of ending is used for stems that end in a vowel. The third set of endings is used for stems that end in labials or post-alveolar sibilants (''б, в, м, п, ф, ш, щ, ч, ж,'' and ''р''). The fourth set of endings is used with verbs whose unaffixed form (no prefixes or suffixes) have the stress on the ending in the first person singular of the present tense. As well, most Class 2 verbs and those verb roots ending in a consonant plus ''л'' or ''р'' take these endings.  Thus for example, ''бери'' and ''вибери''. Class 5 verbs take the first set of endings, but undergo an archaic form of iotation, so that ''дь'' becomes ''ж'' (rather than ''дж''), for example, ''їжте'' &lt; ''їд+ьте''. This does not apply to ''дати'', which is treated as a regular verb with a stem in ''да-''.

Finally note that all verbs with stems that end in ''к'' and ''г'' undergo the first palatalisation. Class 3 verbs with stems in ''к'', ''г'', and ''с'' undergo iotification (as do their present conjugation).

====Conditional active mood====
The [[Grammatical mood#Conditional|conditional mood]] is used to state hypothetical states, wishes, and desires. It has 2 tenses in Ukrainian: a present and a past.

=====Present tense=====
The present conditional is formed in Ukrainian from the participle ''би'' or the short form ''б'', which is derived from the archaic aorist conjugation of the verb, ''бути'', and the active past participle I, which is the same as the past indicative participle. Thus, there is agreement between the subject and the participle. An example of this construction would be ''я би хотів  ...'' (I would like...).

=====Past tense=====
The past conditional is formed in Ukrainian from the participle ''би'' or the short form ''б'' followed by the active past participle I form of the verb ''бути'' (''був, була, було, були'') and then the active past participle I of the verb. Both participles must agree with the subject. An example of this construction would be ''як я би був знав...'' (had I  (had) known...). Alternatively, the past conditional can be formed by using the form ''якби'' and the active past participle I form of the verb, for example, ''якби я знав…''.

====Passive voice====
The [[passive voice]] has 2 different functions. It shows either that the subject has had something done to itself or that something indeterminate has occurred to the subject.
In Ukrainian, the passive voice is formed as follows:
# Use of a reflexive verb: ''митися'' (to wash oneself or in French ''se laver'')
# Use of the verb ''to be'' and the past passive participle: ''Він був вбитий'' (He was killed).
# An impersonal use of the third person plural past active participle I: ''Його вбили'' (He was killed).
# The following construction: ''Було'' + neuter singular of past passive participle, the "-но/-то" form: ''Місто було захоплене'' (The town was captured.).

====Participles and verbal nouns====

In Ukrainian, there exist traces of all five Common Slavic participles.

=====Present active participle=====

This participle is formed by taking the third person plural form, dropping the ''ть'', and adding ''чи(й)''. Most commonly this participle is used as gerund with the form ''чи'' with a meaning approaching the equivalent English construction with ''-ing''. Occasionally, it is used as an adjective. In this case its form is ''чий''. Examples of this participle are ''несучи'', ''знаючи'', and ''хвалячи''.

=====Present passive participle=====

This participle does not exist in Ukrainian as a separate form. However, it is commonly encountered as an adjective in ''-мий''. Common examples of this participle are ''відомий'' and ''знайомий''.

=====Past active participle I=====

This participle is encountered in forming the past tense in Ukrainian. Occasionally, it is found as an adjective for intransitive verbs. It is formed by taking the infinitive stem and adding the ending ''-в, -ла, -ло,'' and ''-ли'' to form the past tense participle (in reality the indefinite form of the adjective) and the ending ''-лий'' to form the regular adjective. An example of the adjectival form is ''почорнілий''.

=====Past active participle II=====

This participle is most commonly encountered as a gerund, while it is only used occasionally as an adjective. It is formed by taking the masculine past participle I and adding the ending ''-ши(й)''. An example of the gerund is ''знавши'', while a common (dialectical) adjective would be the word ''бувший''.

=====Past passive participle=====

The past passive participle is the only participle used commonly as an adjective. There are two parallel forms with no difference in meaning: in ''-тий'' or in ''-ний''. This participle is formed from the infinitive stem for most verbs. Class 2 verbs can as for other participles drop the suffix ''ну'' or only the ''у'', for example, движений from двигнути. Verbs in ''-ува́ти'' or ''-юва́ти'' (those whose ending is stressed) will replace the ''у''  by ''о'' and ''ю'' by ''ь/йо'' (''ь'' if a consonant precedes or ''й'' if a vowel), for example, мальо́ваний from малюва́ти. Finally, Class 3 stems with full voicing have two possible stems: the first is simply obtained by dropping the −ти from the infinitive, while the second is obtained by dropping the last three letters (which in effect means using the present form). The first form will take the −тий ending, while the second form will take the −ний ending, for example полоти has полотий and полений. Note that the verb молоти has the second form мелений, since it derives from *melti in Common Slavonic). The ending is determined as follows:
*If the stem ends in a vowel or ''ер'' or ''ор'' (derived from a sonant r in Common Slavonic), then
**If the vowel is ''и, у, я'' a sibilant plus ''а'', ''ер,'' or ''ор'' then add ''-тий'', for example, розп’ятий, тертий, or жатий.
**For class 3 verbs with full voicing ending in ''о'', then add ''-тий'', for example, поротий.
**For all Class 4 verbs, the ending is ''-єний'', for example, гоєний.
**Otherwise, the ending is ''-ний''.
*If the stem ends in a consonant, then add ''-ений''. Class 1 verbs undergo the first palatalisation, while Class 2, 4, and 5 verbs undergo iotation, for example, печений, тиснений, ораний, лишений, люблений, and їджений.

=====Verbal noun=====

The verbal noun is created by taking the past passive participle, dropping ''ий'', doubling the consonant if permitted by the rules under ''-ĭjV'', and adding a ''я''. This will be a neuter noun declined like all neuter nouns in ''*ĭjе''. It should be noted that if the ''-е-'' of the past passive participle is stressed then the ''е'' will mutate into an ''і''. Examples include ''питання'' from ''питати'' and ''носіння'' from ''носити''. Note that any Class 3 verbs in -увати or -ювати will restore the ''у'' or ''ю'' малювання from мальований (малювати)

The verbal noun in Ukrainian is derived from the Common Slavic verbal noun, where it was formed by adding ''*-ĭjе'' to the past passive participle without the ''*ŭ'' ending. Thus, in Ukrainian, the consonant is doubled if possible.

===Word formation===
Ukrainian has a rich set of [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]], both [[preposition]]al and [[adverb]]ial in nature, as well as [[diminutive]], [[augmentative]], and [[frequentative]] [[suffix]]es. All of these can be stacked one upon the other, to produce multiple derivatives of a given word.  Participles and other inflexional forms may also have a special [[connotation]]. For example, the word '''напіввідкритий''' can be split into the following prefixes and suffixes:
&lt;center&gt;на + пів + від + кри (root) + тий. &lt;/center&gt;

====Prefixes====
In Ukrainian, prefixes can be added to a root and stacked on top of each as in the above example. The most common prefixes are given in the table below. Although the prefixes have the given meaning, when attached to a root, it is possible that the resulting new word will have a unique meaning that is distantly related to the original meaning of the prefix. If possible the example is given using the verbal root '''ходити''' or the nominal root '''хід'''.

(1) The multitude of forms in Ukrainian for the Common Slavic *sŭ(n) (*съ(н)) is a result of the fact that the initial ''s'' could assimilate (or dissimilate) with the root's initial consonants. As well, since a ''ь'' followed there was the potential for further sound changes. Finally, words entered Ukrainian from different Slavic languages with their own peculiarities or that the original origin of the word was lost. The following are examples of all the given possibilities:&lt;ref name=Panejko&gt;{{cite book|title = Граматика Україньської мови |first = Олександер | last = Панейко|location= Augsburg|year = 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*збирати &lt; *събирати
*спекти &lt; *съпекти
*зіпріти &lt; *съприти
*ізнов
*іспит &lt; съпитъ
*зошит &lt; *съшитъ = bound/sown together &lt;ref name="Panejko"/&gt;
*зустріч &lt; *състрѣчь &lt;ref name="Panejko"/&gt;
*сусід &lt; *сѫсѣдъ &lt; *сънсѣдъ = sit together
*союз &lt; *съюзь = yoke together

In Ukrainian, the normal form is ''з'' except before к, п, т, ф and х where the normal form is ''с''.&lt;ref name=orthography/&gt;

The following rules are followed when adding a prefix to the root:
# If the prefix ends in a consonant and the root starts with an iotified vowel, then an apostrophe is added between the prefix and the root, for example, з'їсти.
# If a prefix ends in a consonant and the root starts with two or more consonants, then the vowel ''і'' is inserted between the prefix and the root, for example, розібрати. This does not apply to the prefix в, for example, вбрати.

====Suffixes====
In Ukrainian, suffixes can be added to a root and stacked on top of each to produce a family of words. The most common suffixes are given in the table below. The curly brackets {} denote the various possible different suffixes with a similar meaning

|-

|}

====Adjectives====
Two or more adjectives can be combined into a single word using an '''о''' as the linking vowel, for example, сільськогосподарський, which consists of the adjectives сільський and господарський. If the second adjective starts with a vowel, then a dash can be used to separate the linking vowel and the second adjective, for example, середньо-європеський.

====Verbs====
In addition to the suffixes and prefixes that can be added to verbs, Ukrainian verbs have inherited occasional traces of the Indo-European [[ablaut]]. The primary ablaut is the difference between long and short Indo-European vowels. In Ukrainian, due to the fact that the long and short vowels experienced different reflexes, this ablaut is reflected as a change in vowels. The resulting verbs are often imperfect-perfect pairs. For example, we have скочити and скакати (simplified Indo-European *skoki- and *skōka-).

===Fundamental sentence structure===

====Coordination====
The common Ukrainian [[coordination (conjunction)|coordination]]s are:
* і / й / та(and)
* а (and, but)
* але (but)

====Subordination====
Common Ukrainian [[complementizer|subordinations]] are:

* як (how, if)
* коли (when)
* якщо (if)

==Syntax==
The basic [[word order]], both in conversation and the written language, is [[subject–verb–object]].  However, because the relations are marked by [[inflexion]], considerable latitude in word order is allowed, and all the permutations can be used.  The word order expresses the [[logical stress]], and the degree of [[definiteness]].

=== Negation ===
Unlike English, Latin, and various other languages, Ukrainian allows [[double negative|multiple negatives]], as in “nixto nikoly nikomu ničoho ne proščaje” (‘no-one ever forgives anyone anything’, literally ‘no-one never to no-one nothing does not forgive’). Single negatives are often grammatically incorrect because when negation is used in complex sentences every part that could be grammatically negated should be negative.

Objects of a negated verb are placed in the genitive case, where they would be accusative if the verb were not negated.

===Inflectional usage===

====Case====
The use of [[Grammatical case|cases]] in Ukrainian can be very complicated. In general, the [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[accusative]], and [[vocative]] cases can be used without a [[preposition]]. On the other hand, the [[locative]] and [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] cases are used primarily with a preposition. Furthermore, and much like in [[Latin]], different prepositions can be followed by nouns in different cases, resulting in different meanings.

====Aspect====
Ukrainian verbs can have one of two [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: [[imperfective]] and [[perfective]]. The imperfective form denotes an action that is taking place in the present, is ongoing, is repetitive, or is habitual. The perfective form indicates an action that is completed, is the result of an action, is the beginning of an action, or is shorter or longer than usual. For example, ''spaty'' (спати) is imperfective, while ''pospaty'' (поспати) is perfective.

'''Uruguayan Spanish''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Español uruguayo'' or ''castellano uruguayo'') is the variety of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in [[Uruguay]] and by the [[Uruguayan diaspora]]. Uruguayan Spanish is recognized as a variety of [[Rioplatense Spanish]].

== Influences ==

* There is strong influence of [[Italian language|Italian]] and its dialects, particularly Genovese,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meo Zilio|first=Giovanni|date=1963-64|title=Genovesismos en el español rioplatense|jstor=40297676|journal=Nueva Revista de Filología Hispánica|volume=T. 17, No. 3/4  (1963/1964)|pages=245–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the presence of large Italian communities in the country (for example in [[Montevideo]] and [[Paysandú]]). The Uruguayan accent differs from the accents of Spain and other Spanish American countries, except for Argentina, due to Italian influence. There are many Italian words incorporated in the language (''nona'', ''cucha'', ''fainá'' ("[[farinata]], chickpea flour crêpe"), ''chapar'', ''parlar'', ''festichola'' ([http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/spanish/festichola "house party"]), etc.), as well as words of Italian derivation (for example: ''mina'' derived from ''femmina'', or ''pibe'' ("child") from ''pivello'').
* In the southeastern department of [[Rocha Department|Rocha]], as well as along the northern border with Brazil&lt;ref&gt;D. Lincoln Canfield, ''Spanish Pronunciation in the Americas'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; there is some influence of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], with Portuguese/Spanish [[code-switching]] known as [[Portuñol]].

== Tuteo and voseo  ==

The variety of Spanish used in [[Montevideo]] and the whole southern region of the country exhibits use of the [[voseo]] form of address, with the pronoun ''vos'' instead of the ''tú'' form. In other areas of the country, ''tú'' is more commonly used than ''vos.'' In some places, ''tú'' is used, but with the conjugation corresponding to ''vos'', as in: ''tú tenés'', instead of ''tú tienes'' ([[tuteo]]) or ''vos tenés'' (voseo). Tuteo is much more commonly used in [[Rocha Department|Rocha]] and in some parts of [[Maldonado Department|Maldonado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weyers|first=Joseph R.|date=2014-09-03|title=The Tuteo of Rocha, Uruguay: A Study of Pride and Language Maintenance|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/553445|journal=Hispania|language=en|volume=97|issue=3|pages=382–395|doi=10.1353/hpn.2014.0087|issn=2153-6414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal pronoun ''usted'' is used in very formal contexts, such as when speaking to government authorities.

{{About|the concept Videocracy|the 2009 documentary by [[Erik Gandini]]|Videocracy (film)}}

'''Videocracy''' is the power of the [[image]] over [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;''Towards a "Videocracy"? Italian Political Communication at a Turning Point'', European Journal of Communication 10 (3), 1995, pp.291-319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083400/http://www.topos.ru/veer/01/dar14.html topos.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
"Voter-generated-content", such as videos on [[YouTube]], have been identified as examples of a developing videocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209175201/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vjb8pZ4Et1EJ:www.blogs.uni-osnabrueck.de/americanstudies/author/jakruege/+videocracy+academic&amp;hl=pl&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=25&amp;gl=pl&amp;client=firefox-a American Studies at Osnabrück University website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italy]], the election of [[Silvio Berlusconi]] as Prime Minister in 1994 was seen by many as a "media [[coup d'état]] [and] a drift towards 'videocracy'".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F_7QgEFjRjsC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=videocracy&amp;ei=aSTNSIDXGIm6zATWjeG1Cw&amp;sig=ACfU3U2-Ag7WuvbvvsBoTiw1KdFbTRPHPQ [[Toby Miller|Miller, Toby]], ''Television: Critical Concepts in Media and Cultural Studies'', Routledge, 2003, p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Kifner writes that in [[Romania]] a 'videocracy' was involved in the overthrow of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] in the "first revolution on live television".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s1-r6XOP2CUC&amp;pg=PR19&amp;dq=videocracy&amp;lr=&amp;ei=IS3NSOfzM5LkywS1zPWUAw&amp;sig=ACfU3U0d_GSLHQnMAQYQlXK_jyPERUak1g Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi, Ali Mohammadi, ''Small Media, Big Revolution: Communication, Culture, and the Iranian Revolution'', University of Minnesota Press, 1994, p. xix]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2221">'''William Evans''' (d. 1720?), was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].

==Life==
Evans was educated at the [[college]] at Ystradwalter, then under the presidency of the Rev. Rees Prytherch. He was [[Ordination|ordained]] at [[Pencader, Carmarthenshire|Pencader]], near [[Carmarthen]], in 1688, and continued pastor there for fifteen years. In 1703 he removed to Carmarthen to become pastor of the presbyterian congregation, and received in his house students for the Christian ministry. He has been regarded as the founder of the Welsh Academy, from the fact that the education of divinity students first assumed under him a collegiate form.

Evans was patronised both by the London funds and by the liberality of wealthy dissenters. [[Daniel Williams (theologian)|Dr. Daniel Williams]] bequeathed a sum of money towards his support, and it continued to his successors. He is supposed to have retired in 1718, and he died in 1720.

==Works==
In 1707 Evans published in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''The Principles of the Christian Religion'', based apparently on [[Westminster Assembly]]'s catechism; in 1714 he published and wrote a preface for ''Gemmeu Doethineb'' ("Gems of Wisdom"), a work by his old tutor Rees Prytherch. In 1717 he wrote  and long preface to his friend and neighbour Iago ab Dewi's translation of [[Matthew Henry]]'s ''Catechism''; in 1757 Abel Morgan published Evans's ''Principles of the Christian Religion'', which he had adapted so as to teach [[Believer's baptism|adult baptism]].
