'''Aaron Ben-Ze'ev''' (born 30 July 1949) is an Israeli philosopher.

==Life and career==
Aaron Ben-Ze'ev and his two older brothers Yehuda and Avinoam were born in Israel to Israel and Haika (Weinkrantz) Ben-Ze'ev and were raised on kibbutz [[Ein Carmel]]. When Aaron was 18, his eldest brother Yehuda was killed in the [[Six-Day War]], at the age of 32. Aaron is married to Ruth with two sons, Dean and Adam.

Ben-Ze'ev received his B.A. in Philosophy and Economics (1975) and his M.A. in Philosophy (1977), both from the [[University of Haifa]]. He was awarded his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago (1981).).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lecturers.haifa.ac.il/en/hcc/abenzeev/Pages/default.aspx#|title=Faculty of Humanities: Prpf. Aaron Ben-Zeev|website=[[University of Haifa]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral thesis was entitled "Perception as a Cognitive System"; his doctoral studies advisor was [[Stephen Toulmin]]; [[Alan Gewirth]], [[Robert J. Richards|Robert Richards]], and [[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]] served on the doctoral committee. [[:he:מיכאל שטראוס (פילוסוף)|Michael Strauss]] (his M.A. thesis advisor) and Stephen Toulmin have greatly influenced his philosophical views. Their thinking is marked by a unique combination of a broad outlook on the very profound issues of philosophy (and life), a careful analysis of the details, and the ability to concretize their discussion in everyday issues. Despite such similarity, they came from different backgrounds: While Strauss, like his grandfather [[Martin Buber]], was submersed in the German tradition and his important writings are in German and Hebrew, Toulmin, a pupil of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], grew up within the English analytic tradition.

The philosophers whose writings have made the greatest impact upon Ben-Ze'ev are [[Aristotle]], [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kant’s main influence is most evident in Ben Ze'ev's discussions on epistemology and perception. Aristotle’s and Spinoza’s impact is more apparent in his discussions of the mind–body problem and in his work on the emotions.

Ben-Ze'ev's major books are ''The Perceptual System'' (Peter Lang, 1993); ''The Subtlety of Emotions'' (MIT UP, 2000); ''Love Online: Emotions on the Internet'' (Cambridge UP, 2004); ''In The Name of Love: Romantic Ideology and its Victims'' (with Ruhama Goussinsky, Oxford UP, 2008); ''Die Logik der Gefühle: Kritik der emotionalen Intelligenz'' (Suhrkamp, 2009).

Ben-Ze'ev has held several academic positions at the University of Haifa, including: President (2004–2012); Rector (2000–2004); Dean of Research (1995-2000); Philosophy Department Chairperson (1986–1988); Chairperson of the Humanity Division, Oranim-School of Education (1991–1994); Chairperson of the Association of University Heads, Israel; Head of the University of Haifa Press; and Head of the Academic Channel. He established the Interdisciplinary Center for the Study of Emotions at the University of Haifa. He is currently the President of the newly established European Philosophical Society for the Study of Emotions.&lt;ref&gt;http://navotnaor.wix.com/epsse&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical Views==

===Perception===
In his various writings on perception (in particular, ''The Perceptual System''), Ben-Ze'ev rejects the indirect view of perception and argues for the presence of direct, non-pure perception. He rejects naïve realism as well as extreme subjectivism, and argues for a critical realism. Such realism considers perceptual qualities as properties of the perceptual environment, which is a relational environment that presupposes the existence of a perceiver. Within the perceptual environment, perception is direct, as it involves direct awareness of events in the environment, but in light of the relational nature of this environment, perceptual awareness merely provides partial information about the world—that part which is influenced by the subject’s characteristics. In his view, perception is direct in two major senses: it is perception of the objects themselves, not of internal mental representations, and it is not preceded by mediating inferential processes. Ben-Ze'ev's book ''The Perceptual System'' received an excellent review in ''The Review of Metaphysics'', with the reviewer, Jack Ornstein, stating that Ben-Ze'ev's view is “the only remotely plausible approach” to the mind–body problem: “Finally, we have a theory of perception and the mind which any scientifically-minded, critical philosopher can live with.”&lt;ref&gt;http://philpapers.org/rec/ORNTPS&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his work on perception, Ben-Ze'ev has pursued related issues in the philosophy of psychology, such as the body–mind problem and memory, and has written on various philosophers, in particular Aristotle and Thomas Reid.

===Emotions===
Five years after finishing his Ph.D. thesis, Ben-Ze'ev began to study the emotions, a topic that remains at the center of his research today. In this field he was particularly influenced by Aristotle (mainly his analysis of emotions as evaluative attitudes) and by Spinoza (in particular, his emphasis on the importance of change in generating emotions). The psychological work that has most influenced his thinking has been ''The Cognitive Structure of Emotions'' (1988) by Ortony, Clore and Collins. Ben-Ze'ev has published many articles in this field, as well as several books: ''The Subtlety of Emotions'' (MIT 2000), ''Love Online: Emotions on the Internet'' (Cambridge 2004)),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/14/highereducation.news|title=Let your fingers do the talking|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''the Name of Love: Romantic Ideology and its Victims'' (Oxford: 2008; written with Ruhama Goussinsky), and ''Die Logik der Gefühle: Kritik der emotionalen Intelligenz'' (Suhrkamp, 2009).

'''Alexander Nehamas''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος Νεχαμάς}}; born 22 March 1946) is a Greek-born American philosopher. He is Professor of [[Philosophy]] and [[Edmund N. Carpenter, II]] Class of 1943 Professor in the Humanities at [[Princeton University]], where he has taught since 1990, and a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]]. He works on [[Greek philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[literary theory]].

== Biography ==

Nehamas was born in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] in 1946. In 1964, he enrolled to [[Swarthmore College]]. He graduated in 1967 and completed his doctorate (titled ''Predication and the Theory of Forms in the 'Phaedo''') under the direction of [[Gregory Vlastos]] at [[Princeton University]] in 1971. He taught at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] before joining the Princeton faculty in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.princeton.edu/sites/philosophy/files/person/cv/nehamas_cv.pdf CV]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical work ==

His early work was on [[Platonism|Platonic]] [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]] as well as the philosophy of [[Socrates]], but he gained a wider audience with his 1985 book ''Nietzsche: Life as Literature'' (Harvard University Press), in which he argued that Nietzsche thought of life and the world on the model of a literary text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/books/the-world-as-a-work-of-art.html|title=The World as a Work of Art|last=Harries|first=Karsten|date=1986-01-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nehamas has said, "The virtues of life are comparable to the virtues of good writing—style, connectedness, grace, elegance—and also, we must not forget, sometimes getting it right."&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, David. [http://bombsite.com/issues/65/articles/2190 "Alexander Nehamas"], [[BOMB Magazine]] No. 65 (Fall, 1998). Retrieved 2012-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he has become well known for his view that philosophy should provide a form of life, as well as for his endorsement of the artistic value of [[television]]. This view also becomes evident in his book ''Only a Promise of Happiness''. The title itself is later in this work used as one definition of [[beauty]] with reference to [[Stendhal]]. In that sense, beauty can be found in all media; as Nehamas claims in the same work: "Aesthetic features are everywhere, but that has nothing to do with where the arts can be found. Works of art can be beautiful because everything can be beautiful, but that doesn't mean that anything can be a work of art."&lt;ref name="OPH"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nehamas|first1=Alexander|title=Only a Promise of Happiness: The Place of Beauty in a World of Art|date=2010|publisher=Princeton Univ Pr|isbn=9780691148656|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Nehamas published a book, ''On Friendship'', based on his 2008 Gifford Lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/lecturers/alexander-nehamas|title=Alexander Nehamas|website=The Gifford Lectures|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he argues, contra Aristotle, that friendship is an aesthetic, but not always moral, good.  And—like in his earlier work, ''Only a Promise of Happiness''—he compares friends to artworks. “Like metaphors and works of art, the people who matter to us are all, so far as we are concerned, inexhaustible. They always remain a step beyond the furthest point our knowledge of them has reached—though only if, and as long as, they still matter to us.”&lt;ref name="OF"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nehamas|first1=Alexander|title=On Friendship|date=2016|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465082926|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexandre Kojève''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|ˈ|ʒ|ɛ|v}}; {{IPA-fr|alɛksɑ̃dʁ koʒɛv|lang}}; 28 April 1902 – 4 June 1968) was a Russian-born French [[philosopher]] and [[Politician|statesman]] whose philosophical seminars had an immense influence on [[20th-century French philosophy]], particularly via his integration of [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] concepts into twentieth-century [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Butler 1987, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Descombes]], ''Modern French Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 1980, pp. 158–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
As a statesman in the French government, he was instrumental in the formation of the [[European Union]]. Kojève was a close friend of, and was in lifelong philosophical dialogue with, [[Leo Strauss]].

==Life==
Kojève was born '''Aleksandr Vladimirovič Koževnikov''' ({{lang-rus|Алекса́ндр Влади́мирович Коже́вников|p=ɐlʲɪˈksandr vlɐˈdʲimʲɪrəvʲɪtɕ kɐˈʐɛvnʲɪkəf}}) in Russia to a wealthy and influential family. His uncle was the abstract artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]], about whose work he would write an influential essay in 1936. He was educated at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[Germany]]. In Heidelberg he completed in 1926 his PhD thesis on the Russian religious philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]]'s views on the union of God and man in Christ under the direction of [[Karl Jaspers]]. The title of his thesis was ''Die religiöse Philosophie Wladimir Solowjews'' (''The Religious Philosophy of Vladimir Soloviev'').

Early influences included the philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] and the historian of science [[Alexandre Koyré]]. Kojève spent most of his life in France, and from 1933 to 1939, he delivered in [[Paris]] a series of lectures on [[Georg Hegel]]'s work ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. After [[World War II]], Kojève worked in the French Ministry of Economic Affairs as one of the chief planners of the [[European Common Market]].

Kojève was an extraordinarily learned man. A [[polyglot]], he studied and used Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, Latin, and Classical Greek. He was also fluent in French, German, Russian, and English.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, B.-P. (2011). Alexandre Kojeve: Wisdom at the end of history [Book review]. ''Society'', ''48'', 192-194. Retrieved from [http://www.springerlink.com/content/2l42w71732380008/fulltext.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kojève died in [[Brussels]] in 1968, shortly after giving a talk at the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) on behalf of the French government. In his later years, he had repeatedly expressed the position that what [[Karl Marx|Marx]] called the European [[proletariat]] no longer existed, and the wealthy West sorely needed to help [[Developing country|developing countries]] to overcome widespread poverty through large monetary gifts similar to the [[Marshall Plan]].

==Philosophy==
Though not an orthodox [[Marxism|Marxist]],&lt;ref name = "Kołakowski"&gt;[[Leszek Kołakowski|Kołakowski, Leszek]]. ''Main Currents of Marxism''. Trans. P. S. Falla.  New York and London: W.W. Norton and Company, 2005. {{ISBN|0-393-06054-3}}. P. 929.&lt;/ref&gt; Kojeve was known as an influential and idiosyncratic interpreter of [[Hegel]], reading him through the lens of both [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]. The well-known "[[End of history|End of History]]" thesis advanced the idea that [[Ideology|ideological]] history in a limited sense had ended with the [[French Revolution]] and the regime of [[Napoleon]] and that there was no longer a need for violent struggle to establish the "rational supremacy of the regime of rights and equal recognition." Kojeve's "End of History" is different from [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s later thesis of the same name in that it points as much to a [[Mixed economy|socialist-capitalist synthesis]] as to a triumph of [[liberal capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kojeve | first = Alexandre | title = "Capitalisme et socialisme: Marx est Dieu; Ford est son prophète." ("Capitalism and socialism : Marx is God; Ford is his prophet") | journal = Commentaire | date = Spring 1980 | volume = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Howse | first = Robert | quote = The End of History does not itself resolve the tension within the idea of equality — the ideal of equal recognition that is rationally victorious with the End of History embodies elements of market justice, equal opportunity, and "equivalence" in exchange (the "bourgeois" dimension of the French Revolution). But it also contains within it a socialist or social democratic conception of equality of civic status, implying social regulation, welfare rights, and the like. | title = Kojeve's Latin Empire | url = http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/3437146.html | accessdate = 2008-04-14 | journal = Policy Review | issn = 0146-5945 | issue = 126 | year = 2004| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080318163058/http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/3437146.html| archivedate= 18 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Lilla]] notes that Kojève rejected the prevailing concept among European [[intellectual]]s of the 1930s that capitalism and democracy were failed artifacts of the Enlightenment that would be destroyed by either communism or fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Lilla 2001, 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Kojève, while initially somewhat more sympathetic to the Soviet Union than the United States, devoted much of his thought to protecting western European autonomy, particularly so France, from domination by either the Soviet Union and the United States. He believed that the capitalist United States represented [[Right Hegelians|Right-Hegelianism]] while the state-socialist Soviet Union represented [[Left-Hegelianism]]; victory by either side, he posited, would result in what Lilla describes as "a rationally organized bureaucracy without class distinctions."&lt;ref&gt;Lilla 2001, 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Kojève's more important lectures on Hegel have been published in English in the now classic ''[[Introduction to the Reading of Hegel|Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', in 1947. His interpretation of Hegel has been one of the most influential of the past century. His lectures were attended by a small but influential group of intellectuals including [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[André Breton]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Raymond Aron]], [[Roger Caillois]], [[Michel Leiris]], [[Henry Corbin]], [[Jean Hyppolite]], and [[Éric Weil]]. His interpretation of the [[master–slave dialectic]] was an important influence on [[Jacques Lacan]]'s [[mirror stage]] theory. Other French thinkers who have acknowledged his influence on their thought include the [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] philosophers [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].

Kojeve's correspondence with Leo Strauss has been published along with Kojève's critique of Strauss's commentary on [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Hiero (Xenophon)|Hiero]]'' (see below on their friendship and debate).&lt;ref name="Strauss"&gt;{{citation | last = Strauss | first = Leo | title = On Tyranny | editor-last = Gourevitch | editor-first = Victor | editor2-last = Roth | editor2-first = Michael S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Kojève also met the rightist legal theorist [[Carl Schmitt]], whose "Concept of the Political" he had implicitly criticized in his analysis of Hegel's text on "Lordship and Bondage." Another close friend was the Jesuit Hegelian philosopher [[Gaston Fessard]].

In addition to his lectures on the ''Phenomenology of Spirit,'' Kojève's other publications include a little noticed book on [[Immanuel Kant]], and articles on the relationship between [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] and Marxist thought and [[Christianity]]. His 1943 book, ''Esquisse d'une phenomenologie du droit'', published posthumously in 1981, contrasts the aristocratic and bourgeois views of the right. ''Le Concept, le temps et le discours,'' extrapolates on the Hegelian notion that wisdom only becomes possible in the fullness of time. Kojève's response to Leo Strauss, who disputed this notion, can be found in Kojève's article "The Emperor Julian and his Art of Writing".&lt;ref&gt;published in {{citation | title = Ancients and Moderns: Essays on the Tradition of Political Philosophy in Honor of Leo Strauss | editor-last = Cropsey | editor-first = Joseph | year = 1964 | publisher = Basic Books}}, as well as in the above-mentioned edition of Strauss's ''On Tyranny''&lt;/ref&gt;

Kojève also challenged Strauss' interpretation of the classics in the voluminous ''Esquisse d'une histoire raisonnée de la pensée païenne,'' which covers the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and [[Neoplatonism]]. Recently, three more books have been published: a 1932 thesis on the physical and philosophical importance of [[quantum physics]], an extended 1931 essay on [[atheism]] ("L'athéisme"), and a 1943 work on "The Notion of Authority."

=== Friendship with Strauss ===
Kojève had a close and lifelong friendship with [[Leo Strauss]] which began when they were philosophy students in Berlin. The two shared a deep philosophical respect for each other.  Kojève would later write that he "never would have known [...] what philosophy is" without Strauss.&lt;ref&gt;Lilla 2001, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s the two began a debate on the relation of philosophy to politics that would come to fruition with Kojeve's response to Strauss' ''On Tyranny''.  Kojève, a senior statesman in the French government, argued that philosophers should have an active part in shaping political events. Strauss, on the other hand, believed that philosophy and politics were fundamentally opposed, and that philosophers should not have a substantial role in politics, noting the disastrous results of Plato in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. Philosophers should influence politics only to the extent that they can ensure that philosophical contemplation remains free from the seduction and coercion of power.&lt;ref name="Strauss"/&gt; In spite of this debate, Strauss and Kojève remained friendly. In fact, Strauss would send his best students to [[Paris]] to finish their education under Kojève's personal guidance. Among these were [[Allan Bloom]], who endeavored to make Kojève's works available in English (and published the first edition of Kojève's lectures in English), and [[Stanley Rosen]].

==Kojève and the USSR==
In 1999, ''[[Le Monde]]'' published an article reporting that a French intelligence document showed that Kojève had spied for the [[Soviets]] for over thirty years. The claims of this document (and even its existence) are disputed, and it has never been released. Kojève's supporters tend to believe that if it were true, it was probably unsubstantial as spying per se and a result of his [[megalomania]]cal personality, a pretense to be a philosopher at the end of history influencing the course of world events.

In any case, Kojève's contribution to international French economic policy was more than substantial. Though Kojève often claimed to be a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html|title=The Cult of Lacan: Freud, Lacan and the mirror-stage|author=Richard Webster|work=richardwebster.net|quote=From Kojève Lacan learnt not only a version of Hegel but also the techniques of seduction and intellectual enslavement with which this charismatic teacher, who defined himself as a 'Stalinist of the strictest obedience', enthralled and mesmerized his students.|year=1994|accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; he largely regarded the Soviet Union with contempt, calling its social policies disastrous and its claims to be a truly classless state ludicrous. (Kojève's cynicism towards traditional Marxism as an outmoded philosophy in industrially well-developed [[Capitalism|capitalist]] nations prompted him to go as far as idiosyncratically referring to capitalist [[Henry Ford]] as "the one great authentic Marxist of the twentieth century."&lt;ref name = "Nichols-P90"&gt;Nichols, James H. ''Alexandre Kojève: Wisdom at the End of History''. Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007. {{ISBN|0-7425-2777-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7425-2777-5}}. P. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;) He specifically and repeatedly called it the only existing country in which 19th-century capitalism still existed. His "Stalinism" was ironic to the extent Stalin had no political chance to lead the [[Weltgeist]]; yet, he was serious about Stalinism to the extent that he regarded the utopia of the Soviet Union under Stalin, and the willingness to purge unsupportive elements in the population, as evidence of a desire to bring about the end of history, and as a repetition of the [[Reign of Terror]] of the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Geroulanos, ''An Atheism That Is Not Humanist Emerges in French Thought'', pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics ==
In a commentary on [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s  ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', [[Roger Scruton]] calls Kojève "a life-hating Russian at heart, a self-declared Stalinist, and a civil servant who played a leading behind-the-scenes role in establishing both the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and the [[European Economic Community]]" and states the opinion that Kojève was "a dangerous psychopath."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Scruton]], [http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-fukuyama/trouble_3605.jsp "The trouble with Islam, the European Union - and Francis Fukuyama"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{why|date=March 2018}}

[[Apple]]s appear in many [[World religions|religious traditions]], often as a [[Mysticism|mystical]] or [[forbidden fruit]]. One of the problems identifying apples in [[religion]], [[mythology]] and [[Fairy tale|folktales]] is that as late as the 17th century, the word "apple" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit other than berries, but including nuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=apple|work= Online Etymology Dictionary|author= Douglas Harper, Historian|date= 25 May 2011|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/apple}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term may even have extended to plant [[gall]]s, as they were thought to be of plant origin (see [[oak apple]]).  For instance, when [[tomato]]es were introduced into Europe, they were called "love apples".  In one Old English work, [[cucumber]]s are called ''eorþæppla'' (lit. "earth-apples'), just as in [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Afrikaans, [[Persian language|Persian]]  and [[Swiss German]] as well as several other German dialects, the words for [[potato]]es mean "earth-apples".  In some languages, [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s are called "golden apples" or "Chinese apples". [[Datura]] is called 'thorn-apple".

[[ethnobotany|Ethnobotanical]] and [[ethnomycology|ethnomycological]] scholars such as [[R. Gordon Wasson]], [[Carl Ruck]] and [[Clark Heinrich]] write that the mythological apple is a symbolic substitution for the [[entheogen]]ic [[Amanita muscaria]] (or fly agaric) mushroom.  Its association with knowledge is an allusion to the revelatory states described by some shamans and users of psychedelic mushrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Thus, secular art as well made use of the apple as [[symbol]] of love and sexuality. It is often an attribute associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] who is shown holding it.

{{or-section|date=September 2014}}[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Adam and Eve (Prado) 2.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'': a classic depiction of the biblical tale showcasing the apple as a symbol of sin. [[Albrecht Dürer]], 1507; oil on panel.]]

Though the forbidden fruit in the [[Book of Genesis]] is not identified, popular [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition holds that [[Adam and Eve]] ate an apple from the forbidden tree in the [[Garden of Eden]]. The unnamed fruit of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] thus became an apple under the influence of the story of the [[golden apple]]s in the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Garden of Hesperides]]. As a result, the apple became a symbol for [[knowledge]], [[immortality]], [[temptation]], the [[fall of man]] and sin.

The classical Greek word μήλον (mēlon), or dialectal μᾶλον (mālon), now a [[loanword]] in English as [[melon]], meant tree [[fruit]] in general,&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmh%3Dlon2 μῆλον] at [[Liddell &amp; Scott]].&lt;/ref&gt; but was borrowed into [[Latin]] as ''[[Wiktionary:malum#Noun 3|mālum]]'', meaning 'apple'. The similarity of this word to Latin ("[[Wiktionary:malum#Noun 2|mălum]]") , meaning 'evil', may also have influenced the apple's becoming interpreted as the [[Bible|biblical]] 'forbidden fruit' in the commonly used Latin translation called "[[Vulgate]]".  The [[larynx]] in the human throat has been called [[Adam's apple]] because of the folk tale that the bulge was caused by the forbidden fruit sticking in the throat of Adam.  The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has sometimes been used to imply sexuality between men, possibly in an ironic vein.

[[File:Francisco de Zurbarán - A Virgem da Maçã, 1660-64.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco de Zurbarán]] - ''A Virgem da Maçã'', 1660-64]]
The notion of the apple as a symbol of sin is reflected in artistic renderings of the fall from Eden. When held in Adam's hand, the apple symbolises sin.  But, when [[Christ]] is portrayed holding an apple, he represents the Second Adam who brings life.  This difference reflects the evolution of the symbol in Christianity. In the [[Old Testament]], the apple was significant of the fall of man; in the [[New Testament]], it is an emblem of the redemption from that fall.  The apple is represented in pictures of [[the Madonna]] and [[Infant Jesus]] as another sign of that redemption.

In some versions (such as Young's Literal Translation) of the Bible, the [[Hebrew]] word for [[Mandrake#In the Bible|mandrake]]s ''dudaim'' (Genesis 30:14) is translated as "love apples" (not to be confused with the [[New World]] tomatoes).  There are several instances in the Old Testament where the apple is used in a more favourable light.  The phrase 'the apple of your eye' comes from verses in Deuteronomy 32:10, Psalm 17:8 Proverbs 7:2, and Zechariah 2:8, implying an object or person who is greatly valued.  In [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 25:11, the verse states, "''a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver''".  In the love songs of the [[Song of Solomon]], the apple is used in a sensual context.  In these latter instances, the apple is used as a symbol for beauty.  The apple appears again in Joel 1:12 in a verse with a sense of profound loss when the apple tree withers.
During the Jewish New Year - [[Rosh Hashanah]] - it is customary to eat apples dipped in honey to evoke a "new year that is good [the apple] and sweet [the honey]".

It is a long-standing [[tradition]] in many tribal communities that the first born child of any couple shall be presented with an [[apple]] randomly picked from a [[tree]] by their paternal [[grandparents]] on the day of their birth. If the chosen apple is sliced 
open and revealed to have a [[worm]] inside, it is a bad omen and on their 21st birthday, the child must perform a dance to the fruit gods 
to spare the lives of their own offspring.

[[File:Nicolas Colombel 002.jpg|thumb|''Atalanta and Hippomenes'' by [[Nicolas Colombel]]]]

The [[Greek hero]] [[Heracles]], as a part of his [[Heracles#The Twelve Labours|Twelve Labours]], was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Tree of Life]] growing at its center.

[[Atalanta]], also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but [[Hippomenes]] (a.k.a. [[Melanion]], a name possibly derived from ''melon'' the Greek word for both "apple" and fruit in general), who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.

The Greek goddess of discord, [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed [[Kallisti]] ('For the most beautiful one'), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Troy]] was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of [[Sparta]]. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the [[Trojan War]].

===Norse===
In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] was the appointed keeper of golden apples that kept the [[Æsir]] young (or [[immortality|immortal]]) forever. Iðunn was abducted by [[Þjazi]] the [[Jötunn|giant]], who used [[Loki]] to lure Iðunn and her apples out of [[Asgard|Ásgarðr]]. The Æsir began to age without Iðunn's apples, so they coerced Loki into rescuing her. After borrowing [[Freya|Freyja's]] falcon skin, Loki liberated Iðunn from Þjazi by transforming her into a nut for the flight back. Þjazi gave chase in the form of an eagle, whereupon reaching Ásgarðr he was set aflame by a bonfire lit by the Æsir. With the return of Iðunn's apples, the Æsir regained their lost youth. Apple trees were the symbol of rebirth and beauty; the apple tree was sacred in Norse mythology.

[[Image:Allantide.jpg|thumb|The Allantide game]]

[[Allantide]] ({{lang-kw|italic=yes|Kalan Gwav}}, meaning ''first day of winter'') is a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] festival that was traditionally celebrated on the night of 31 October, as well as the following day time. One of the most important parts of this festival was the giving of Allan apples, large glossy red apples that were highly polished, to family and friends as tokens of good luck. Allan apple markets used to be held throughout West Cornwall in the run up to the feast. and in the town of [[St Just in Penwith|St Just]] it surpassed Christmas as a time for giving gifts until the late 20th century. A game was also recorded in which two pieces of wood were nailed together in the shape of a cross. It was then suspended, with 4 lit candles on each arm and Allan apples suspended underneath. The aim being to catch the apples with your mouth without getting molten wax on your face. For unmarried recipients the apples would be placed under their pillows in the hope that they would bring dreams of their future wife or husband.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Reed - The Cornish Traditional Year 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''(Geheime) Berliner Mittwochsgesellschaft''' ("[Secret] Berlin Wednesday Society") was a small group of German liberal thinkers in Berlin.

As early as 1783 (with [[Johann Erich Biester]] as secretary), intellectuals associated with the [[Late Enlightenment]] had gathered in a ''Gesellschaft der Freunde der Aufklärung'', or Society of Friends of the Enlightenment. It was established by [[Wilhelm Abraham Teller]]. Members included the Prussian finance minister [[Carl August von Struensee]], the finance councillor [[Johann Heinrich Wloemer]] (1726–1797), the poet [[Leopold Friedrich Günther von Goeckingk]], [[Christian Konrad Wilhelm von Dohm]], the theatre director and writer [[Johann Jacob Engel]], the Supreme Court councillor [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Beneke]], [[Friedrich Gedike]], [[Karl Franz von Irwing]], the jurist [[Ernst Ferdinand Klein]], [[Franz Michael Leuchsenring]], the physician [[Johann Carl Wilhelm Moehsen]] und [[Christian Gottlieb Selle]], the preachers [[Johann Joachim Spalding]] and [[Johann Friedrich Zöllner]], and [[Karl Gottlieb Suarez]]. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] was an honorary member.

It was through this scholarly semi-secret society, as well as through the longer-lived [[Montagsclub]], which had a more social character, that the Berlin Enlightenment spread its ideas, using the ''[[Berlinische Monatsschrift]]'' as an outlet. Nearly every member wrote in this paper, and [[Werner Krauss (academic)|Werner Krauss]], in his studies of the period, called it the movement's most important forum.

In 1798, [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] closed down the society as a threat to public order.

With the short-lived ''Berliner Blätter'' and ''Neue Berlinische Monatsschrift'' (which lasted until 1811), Biester continued to promote their ideas, the enthusiasm for which philosophical Idealism had threatened to quench; but the standards of previous years (when Kant had made contributions) were never quite matched, and Biester died in 1816, with no-one left to replace him.

{{about|evidence handling in U.S. criminal trials|rules in American football|Tom Brady#The Brady rule}}
{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''''Brady'' disclosure''' consists of [[Exculpatory evidence|exculpatory]] or [[witness impeachment|impeaching]] information and evidence that is material to the guilt or innocence or to the punishment of a defendant. The term comes from the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]'',&lt;ref&gt;373 U.S. 83 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Supreme Court ruled that suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to a defendant who has requested it violates [[due process]]. 

Following ''Brady'', the prosecutor must disclose evidence or information that would prove the innocence of the defendant or would enable the defense to more effectively impeach the credibility of government witnesses. Evidence that would serve to reduce the defendant's sentence must also be disclosed by the prosecution. In practice this doctrine has often proved difficult to enforce. Some states have established their own laws to try to strengthen enforcement against prosecutorial misconduct in this area.

==Definition of the ''Brady'' rule==
The ''Brady'' doctrine is a [[pretrial discovery]] rule that was established by the United States Supreme Court in ''Brady v. Maryland'' (1963).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], and Guyora Binder, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/ {{smallcaps|Criminal Law - Cases and Materials}}] 4 (Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business, 7th ed. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The rule requires that the prosecution must turn over all exculpatory evidence to the [[defendant]] in a [[criminal case]]. Exculpatory [[evidence]] is evidence that might exonerate the defendant.

==Examples==
Examples include the following:
* The prosecutor must disclose an agreement not to prosecute a witness in exchange for the witness's testimony.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Giglio v. United States]]'', 405 U.S. 150 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prosecutor must disclose leniency (or preferential treatment) agreements made with witnesses in exchange for testimony.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Sudikoff'', 36 F.Supp. 2d 1196 (C.D. Cal. 1999); ''State v. Lindsey'', 621 So. 2d 618 (La. Ct. App. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prosecutor must disclose [[exculpatory evidence]] known only to the police. That is, the prosecutor has a duty to reach out to the police and establish regular procedures by which the police inform the prosecutor's office of anything that tends to prove the innocence of the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;''Kyles v. Whitley'', 514 U.S. 419 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Not all exculpatory evidence is required to be disclosed by Brady and its progeny; only evidence that is "material to guilt or punishment" must be disclosed because its disclosure would create a reasonable probability of changing the outcome of the proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strickler v. Greene]]'', 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor is not obligated to ''personally'' review police files in search of exculpatory information when the defendant asks for it, but to allow the defense reasonable access.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Herring'', 83 F.3d 1120 (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court observed in ''[[Strickler v. Greene]]'', "Thus the term 'Brady violation' is sometimes used to refer to any breach of the broad obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence – that is, to any suppression of so-called 'Brady material' – although strictly speaking, there is never a real 'Brady violation' unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict."&lt;ref&gt;Strickler, 527 U.S. at 281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, "The Inquisition by Special Prosecutor in United States v. Senator Ted Stevens: of Brady, Contempt, and the Forensic Trifecta", Vol. 51, No. 1 ''Criminal Law Bulletin'' 69-125 (Thompson Reuters 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prosecutor must disclose arrest photographs of the defendant when those photos do not match the victim's description.&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth v. Tucceri'', 412 Mass. 401 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures for compliance==
* In order to ensure compliance with ''Brady'', the United States Supreme Court repeatedly urged the "careful prosecutor" to favor disclosure over concealment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kyles v. Whitley]]'', 514 U.S. 419, 440; ''[[United States. v. Agurs]]'', 427 U.S. 97, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Conformity with ''Brady'' is a continuing obligation of prosecutors.  Some prosecuting attorney offices have adopted and created specialized procedure and bureaus to meet their burden.&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://da.co.la.ca.us/sd02-08.htm |title=Special Directive 02-08 Brady Protocol |date=December 7, 2002 |publisher=[[Los Angeles County District Attorney]] |accessdate=April 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408213135/http://da.co.la.ca.us/sd02-08.htm |archivedate=April 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Superior Court]'', 11 Cal.3d 531 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; is the source for a "[[Pitchess motion]]". Such a motion can be made by a criminal defendant to discover complaints made against a police officer, and the investigation of those complaints, such that they are contained in the officer’s personnel records. The motions can be made in a [[California Superior Court]] under California Evidence Code 1043-1046.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Evid. Code §§ [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=evid&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1040-1047 1043-1046] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408212529/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=evid&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1040-1047# |date=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the broad nature of the discovery that the associated court rule and statute provide, getting actual records is problematic. In California, there is a carefully prescribed procedure governing such request, and making disclosure without an order is a crime.  The statutory scheme was developed, in part, because law enforcement departments had developed a practice of purging their files concerning misconduct claims made against their officers.&lt;ref name="Steering"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brady List and Pitchess Motions |first1=Jerry L. |last1=Steering |url=http://steeringlaw.com/brady-list-pitchess-motion/ |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buddhism in Vietnam''' (''Đạo Phật'' or ''Phật Giáo'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]), as practised by the [[Vietnamese people|ethnic Vietnamese]], is mainly of the [[Mahayana]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Cuong Tu Nguyen &amp; A.W. Barber. "Vietnamese Buddhism in North America: Tradition and Acculturation". in Charles S. Prebish and [[Kenneth K. Tanaka]] (eds). The Faces of Buddhism in America. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998, pg 130.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] may have first come to [[Vietnam]] as early as the 3rd or 2nd century BCE from [[South Asia]] or from [[China]] in the 1st or 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Cuong Tu Nguyen. ''Zen in Medieval Vietnam: A Study of the Thiền Uyển Tập Anh''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1997, pg 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese Buddhism has had a [[Religious syncretism|syncretic]] relationship with certain elements of [[Taoism]], [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese spirituality]] and the [[Vietnamese folk religion]].&lt;ref name="Nguyen 1998, pg 132"&gt;Cuong Tu Nguyen &amp; A.W.

==History==

===Dynastic period===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 47 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Ceramic pagoda with lotus, bodhi leaf, dancer decoration, Hanoi (Lý dynasty, 11th-13th century)]]
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 37 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Terracotta Bodhi leaves with dragon motif (Lý-Trần dynasties, 11th-14th century)]]

There are conflicting theories regarding whether Buddhism first reached Vietnam during the 3rd or 2nd century BCE via delegations from India, or during the 1st or 2nd century from China.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Tai Thu. ''The History of Buddhism in Vietnam''. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, by the end of the second century CE, Vietnam had developed into a major regional Mahayana Buddhist center centering on [[Luy Lâu]] in modern [[Bắc Ninh Province]], northeast of the present day capital city of [[Hanoi]]. Luy Lâu was the capital of the Han region of [[Jiaozhi]] and was a popular place visited by many Indian Buddhist missionary monks en route to China. The monks followed the maritime trade route from the Indian sub-continent to China used by Indian traders. A number of [[Mahayana sutras]] and the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]] were translated into [[Classical Chinese]] there, including the ''[[Sutra of Forty-two Chapters]]'' and the ''[[Anapanasati]]''.

Jiaozhi was the birthplace of Buddhist missionary [[Kang Senghui]] who was of Sogdian origin.&lt;ref name="Nguyen2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tai Thu Nguyen|title=The History of Buddhism in Vietnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUN8tC0ftJcC&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=CRVP|isbn=978-1-56518-098-7|pages=36–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nguyen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tai Thu Nguyen|title=The History of Buddhism in Vietnam|url=https://www.academia.edu/10344614/Buddhism_in_Vietnam|year=2008|publisher=CRVP|isbn=978-1-56518-098-7|pages=36–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next eighteen centuries, Vietnam and China shared many common features of cultural, philosophical and religious heritage. This was due to geographical proximity to one another and Vietnam being annexed twice by China. Vietnamese Buddhism is thus related to [[Chinese Buddhism]] in general, and to some extent reflects the formation of Chinese Buddhism after the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Prebish, Charles 1998. p. 134"&gt;Prebish, Charles. Tanaka, Kenneth. ''The Faces of Buddhism in America.'' 1998. p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], on the other hand, would become incorporated through the southern annexation of [[Khmer people]] and territories.

During the [[Đinh dynasty]] (968-980), Buddhism was recognized by the state as an official faith (~971), reflecting the high esteem of Buddhist faith held by the Vietnamese monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Tai Thu 2008, pg 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Early Lê dynasty]] (980-1009) also afforded the same recognition to the Buddhist church. The growth of Buddhism during this time is attributed to the recruitment of erudite monks to the court as the newly independent state needed an ideological basis on which to build a country. Subsequently, this role was ceded to Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Tai Thu 2008, pg 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnamese Buddhism reached its zenith during the [[Lý dynasty]] (1009–1225) beginning with the founder [[Lý Thái Tổ]], who was raised in a [[pagoda]].&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Tai Tu Nguyen 2008, pg 89.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the kings during the Lý dynasty professed and sanctioned Buddhism as the state religion. This endured with the [[Trần dynasty]] (1225–1400) but Buddhism had to share the stage with the emerging growth of [[Confucianism]].

By the 15th century, Buddhism fell out of favor with the court during the Later Lê dynasty, although still popular with the masses. Officials like [[Lê Quát]] attacked it as heretical and wasteful.&lt;ref&gt;''Việt Nam: Borderless Histories'' – Page 67 Nhung Tuyet Tran, Anthony Reid – 2006 "In this first formal attack in 1370, a Confucian official named Lê Quát attempted, without much success, to brand Buddhism as heretical and to promote Confucianism. Times had drastically changed by Ngô Sĩ Liên's Lê dynasty."&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 19th century that Buddhism regained some stature under the [[Nguyễn dynasty]] who accorded royal support.&lt;ref&gt;''The Vietnam Review'': Volume 3 1997 "Buddhism The close association between kingship and Buddhism established by the Ly founder prevailed until the end of the Trân. That Buddhism was the people's predominant faith is seen in this complaint by the Confucian scholar Lê Quát ."&lt;/ref&gt;

A Buddhist revival movement (Chấn hưng Phật giáo) emerged in the 1920s in an effort to reform and strengthen institutional Buddhism, which had lost grounds to the spread of Christianity and the growth of other faiths under French rule. The movement continued into the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Elise Anne DeVido.

From 1954 to 1975, Vietnam was split into [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]]. In a country where surveys of the religious composition estimated the Buddhist majority to be approximately 50 to 70 percent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/vietnam_war/3033916.html The 1966 Buddhist Crisis in South Vietnam] HistoryNet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gettleman, pp. 275&amp;ndash;76, 366.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, pp. 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874816-2,00.html | work=Time | title=South Viet Nam: The Religious Crisis | date=1963-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 49, 291, 293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maclear, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/doc125.htm SNIE 53-2-63, "The Situation in South Vietnam, 10 July 1963&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401093545/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/doc125.htm |date=April 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Ngô Đình Diệm]]'s policies generated claims of religious bias. As a member of the Catholic Vietnamese minority, he pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists.
{{further|Roman Catholicism in Vietnam#Roman Catholicism in South Vietnam (1954&amp;ndash;1975)}}

In May 1963, in the central city of [[Huế]], where Diệm's elder brother [[Ngô Đình Thục]] was the archbishop, Buddhists were prohibited from displaying Buddhist flags during [[Vesak]] celebrations&lt;ref&gt;Topmiller, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; yet few days earlier, Catholics were allowed to fly religious flags at a celebration in honour of the newly seated [[archbishop]]. This led to widespread protest against the government; troops were sent in and nine civilians were killed in the confrontations. This led to mass rallies against Diệm's government, termed as the [[Buddhist crisis]]. The conflicts culminated in [[Thích Quảng Đức]]'s self-immolation. President Diệm's younger brother [[Ngô Đình Nhu]] favored strong-armed tactics and [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces]] engaged in the [[Xá Lợi Pagoda raids]], killing estimated hundreds.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Dismayed by the public outrage, the US government withdrew support for the regime. President Diệm was [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|deposed and killed in the 1963 coup]].&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, pp. 295&amp;ndash;325.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, pp. 212&amp;ndash;250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political strength of the Buddhists grew in the 1960s as the different schools and orders convene to form the [[Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam|Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam]]. Leaders of the Church like [[Thích Trí Quang]] had considerable sway in national politics, at times challenging the government.

With the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975, the whole nation came under [[Communist]] rule; many religious practices including Buddhism were discouraged.In the North the government had created the [[United Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]], co-opting the clergy to function under government auspices but in the South, the [[Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]] still held sway and openly challenged the communist government.  The Sangha leadership was thus arrested and imprisoned; Sangha properties were seized and the Sangha itself was outlawed. In its place was the newly created [[Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]], designed as the final union of all Buddhist organizations, now under full state control.  
   
Since [[Đổi Mới]] (1986) many reforms have allowed Buddhism to be practiced relatively unhindered by the individuals. However no organized sangha is allowed to function independent of the state. It was not until 2007 that [[Pure Land Buddhism]], the most widespread type of Buddhism practiced in Vietnam, was officially recognized as a religion by the government.&lt;ref name="vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn"&gt;[https://archive.is/20070704170230/http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/showarticle.php?num=01REL271207 "Pure Land Buddhism recognised by Gov’t."] ''Viet Nam News''.

Today, Buddhists are found throughout in Vietnam, from North to South. Buddhism is the single largest organized religion in Vietnam, with somewhere between 9%&lt;ref&gt;[http://giacngo.vn/thoisu/cauchuyentrongtuan/2012/11/11/1EC011/ Đâu là con số thực về tín đồ Phật giáo Việt Nam?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115214306/http://giacngo.vn/thoisu/cauchuyentrongtuan/2012/11/11/1EC011/ |date=January 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_atheist.html The Largest Atheist / Agnostic Populations]&lt;/ref&gt; and 16%&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape.aspx The Global Religious Landscape 2010]''.

After the fall of South Vietnam to communism in 1975 at the end of the [[Vietnam War]], the first major Buddhist community appeared in North America. Since this time, the North American Vietnamese Buddhist community has grown to some 160 temples and centers. Proselytizing is not a priority.

The most famous practitioner of synchronized [[Vietnamese Thiền]] in the West is [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] who has authored dozens of books and founded the Dharma center [[Plum Village]] in France together with his colleague, [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī]] and Zen Master [[Chân Không]]. According to Nguyen and Barber, Thích Nhất Hạnh's fame in the Western world as a proponent of engaged Buddhism and a new Thiền style has "no affinity with or any foundation in traditional Vietnamese Buddhist practices" &lt;ref&gt;Cuong Tu Nguyen &amp; A. W. Barber 1998, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Alexander Soucy (2007) his style of Zen Buddhism is not reflective of actual Vietnamese Buddhism. Thích Nhất Hạnh often recounts about his early Thiền practices in Vietnam in his Dharma talks saying that he continued and developed this practice in the West which has a distinctive Vietnamese Thiền flavor.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Thích Nhất Hạnh's Buddhist teachings have started to return to a Vietnam where the Buddhist landscape is now being shaped by the combined Vietnamese and Westernized Buddhism that is focused more on the meditative practices.&lt;ref name="Alexander Soucy 2007" /&gt;

==Practice==
[[Image:Ksitigarbha Statue Mural Vietnam.jpeg|thumb|right|Vietnamese art of the [[pure land]] of [[Ksitigarbha|Kṣitigarbha]].]]

Followers in Vietnam practice differing traditions without any problem or sense of contradiction.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 1998, pg 135"&gt;Cuong Tu Nguyen &amp; A. W. Barber 1998, pg 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Few Vietnamese Buddhists would identify themselves as a particular kind of Buddhism, as a Christian might identify him or herself by a denomination, for example. Although Vietnamese Buddhism does not have a strong centralized structure, the practice is similar throughout the country at almost any temple.

Gaining merit is the most common and essential practice in Vietnamese Buddhism with a belief that liberation takes place with the help of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Buddhist monks commonly chant sutras, recite Buddhas’ names (particularly [[Amitābha]]), doing repentance and praying for rebirth in the Pure Land.&lt;ref&gt;Cuong Tu Nguyen &amp; A. W. Barber 1998, pg 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' and the ''[[Amitabha Sutra]]'' are the most commonly used sutras.&lt;ref&gt;Cuong Tu Nguyen &amp; A. W. Barber 1998, pg 134 .&lt;/ref&gt; Most sutras and texts are in Classical Chinese  and are merely recited with [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]], making them incomprehensible to most practitioners.

Three services are practiced regularly at dawn, noon, and dusk. They include sutra reading with [[nianfo|niệm Phật]] and [[dhāraṇī]] recitation and [[kinhin|kinh hành]] (walking meditation). Laypeople at times join the services at the temple and some devout Buddhist practice the services at home. Special services such as Sam Nguyen/Sam Hoi (confession/repentance) takes place on the [[full moon]] and [[new moon]] each month. Niệm Phật practice is one way of repenting and purifying bad karma.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 1998, pg 135"/&gt;

Buddhist temples also serve a significant role in death rituals and funerals among [[overseas Vietnamese]].

The overall doctrinal position of Vietnamese Buddhism is the inclusive system of [[Tiantai]], with the higher metaphysics informed by the [[Huayan school]] ({{lang-vi|Hoa Nghiêm}}); however, the orientation of Vietnamese Buddhism is syncretic without making such distinctions.&lt;ref name="Prebish, Charles 1998. p. 134"/&gt; Therefore, modern practice of Vietnamese Buddhism can be very eclectic, including elements from ''[[Vietnamese Thiền|Thiền]]'' ([[Chan Buddhism]]), ''Thiên Thai'' ([[Tiantai]]), ''Tịnh độ'' [[Pure Land Buddhism]], and popular practices from [[Vajrayana]].&lt;ref name="Prebish, Charles 1998. p. 134"/&gt; According to Charles Prebish, many English language sources contain misconceptions regarding the variety of doctrines and practices in traditional Vietnamese Buddhism:&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, Charles. Tanaka, Kenneth. ''The Faces of Buddhism in America.'' 1998. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We will not consider here the misconceptions presented in most English-language materials regarding the distinctness of these schools, and the strong inclination for "syncretism" found in Chinese and Vietnamese Buddhism. Much has been said about the incompatibility of different schools and their difficulty in successfully communicating with each other and combining their doctrines. None of these theories reflects realities in Vietnam (or China) past or present. The followers have no problem practicing the various teachings at the same time.}}
The methods of Pure Land Buddhism are perhaps the most widespread within Vietnam. It is common for practitioners to recite [[sutra]]s, chants and [[dhāraṇī]]s looking to gain protection through [[bodhisattva]]s or [[dharmapala]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cuong Tu Nguyen 1997, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Buddhist devotion|devotional practice]] where those practicing put their [[faith in Buddhism|faith]] in [[Amitābha]] ({{lang-vi|A-di-đà}}). Followers believe they will gain rebirth in his [[pure land]] by chanting Amitabha's name. A pure land is a Buddha-realm where one can more easily attain enlightenment since suffering does not exist there.

Many religious organizations have not been recognized by the government; however, in 2007, with 1.5 million followers, the Vietnamese Pure Land Buddhism Association (Tịnh Độ Cư Sĩ Phật Hội Việt Nam) received official recognition as an independent and legal religious organization.&lt;ref name="vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn" /&gt;

Thiền is the [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations|Sino-Xenic pronunciation]] of ''Chan'' (Japanese ''Zen'') and is derived ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] "[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]". The traditional account is that in 580, an Indian monk named Vinitaruci ({{lang-vi|Tì-ni-đa-lưu-chi}}) traveled to Vietnam after completing his studies with [[Sengcan]], the third patriarch of Chan Buddhism. This would be the first appearance of Thiền. The sect that Vinitaruci and his lone Vietnamese disciple founded would become known as the oldest branch of Thiền. After a period of obscurity, the Vinitaruci School became one of the most influential Buddhist groups in Vietnam by the 10th century, particularly under the patriarch [[Vạn-Hạnh]] (died 1018). Other early Vietnamese Zen schools included the Vô Ngôn Thông, which was associated with the teaching of [[Mazu Daoyi]], and the Thảo Đường, which incorporated [[nianfo]] chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks.

A new Thiền school was founded by King [[Trần Nhân Tông]] (1258–1308); called the [[Trúc Lâm]] "Bamboo Grove" school, it evinced a deep influence from [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophy. Nevertheless, Trúc Lâm's prestige waned over the following centuries as Confucianism became dominant in the royal court. In the 17th century, a group of Chinese monks led by Nguyên Thiều introduced the Ling school (Lâm Tế). A more native offshoot of Lâm Tế, the Liễu Quán school, was founded in the 18th century and has since been the predominant branch of Vietnamese Zen.

Some scholars argue that the importance and prevalence of Thiền in Vietnam has been greatly overstated and that it has played more of an elite rhetorical role than a role of practice.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Soucy.

===Theravada===
[[Image:VietnamChampa1.gif|thumb|South East Asia circa 1010 CE, [[Đại Việt]] (Vietnamese) lands in yellow]]

The central and southern part of present-day Vietnam were originally inhabited by the [[Chams]] and the [[Khmer people]], respectively, who followed both a syncretic [[Shaivism|Śaiva]]-[[Mahayana]] (see [[History of Buddhism in Cambodia]]) and [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]. [[Đại Việt]] annexed the land occupied by the Cham during conquests in the 15th century and by the 18th century had also annexed the southern portion of the [[Khmer Empire]], resulting in the current borders of Vietnam. From that time onward, the dominant Đại Việt (Vietnamese) followed the Mahayana tradition while the Khmer continued to practice Theravada.

In the 1920s and 1930s, there were a number of movements in Vietnam for the revival and modernization of Buddhist activities. Together with the re-organization of Mahayana establishments, there developed a growing interest in Theravadin meditation as well as the [[Pāli Canon]]. These were then available in French. Among the pioneers who brought Theravada Buddhism to the ethnic Đại Việt was a young veterinary doctor named Lê Văn Giảng. He was born in the South, received higher education in Hanoi, and after graduation, was sent to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to work for the French government.

During that time he became especially interested in Theravada Buddhist practice. Subsequently, he decided to ordain and took the Dhamma name of Hộ-Tông (Vansarakkhita). In 1940, upon an invitation from a group of lay Buddhists led by Nguyễn Văn Hiểu, he went back to Vietnam in order to help establish the first Theravada temple for Vietnamese Buddhists at Gò Dưa, Thủ Đức (now a district of Hồ Chí Minh City). The temple was named Bửu Quang (Ratana Ramsyarama). The temple was destroyed by French troops in 1947, and was later rebuilt in 1951. At Bửu Quang temple, together with a group of Vietnamese [[bhikkhu]]s who had received training in Cambodia such as Thiện Luật, Bửu Chơn, Kim Quang and Giới Nghiêm, Hộ Tông began teaching Buddhism in their native Vietnamese. He also translated many Buddhist materials from the Pali Canon, and Theravada became part of Vietnamese Buddhist activity in the country.

In 1949–1950, Hộ Tông together with Nguyễn Văn Hiểu and supporters built a new temple in Saigon (now Hồ Chí Minh City), named Kỳ Viên Tự (''Jetavana Vihara''). This temple became the centre of Theravada activities in Vietnam, which continued to attract increasing interest among the Vietnamese Buddhists. In 1957, the Vietnamese Theravada Buddhist Sangha Congregation (Giáo Hội Tăng Già Nguyên Thủy Việt Nam) was formally established and recognised by the government, and the Theravada Sangha elected Venerable Hộ Tông as its first President, or Sangharaja.

From Saigon, the Theravada movement spread to other provinces, and soon, a number of Theravada temples for ethnic Viet Buddhists were established in many areas in the South and Central parts of Vietnam. There are 529 Theravada temples throughout the country, of which 19 were located in Hồ Chí Minh City and its vicinity. Besides Bửu Quang and Kỳ Viên temples, other well known temples are Bửu Long, Giác Quang, Tam Bảo ([[Đà Nẵng]]), Thiền Lâm and Huyền Không ([[Huế]]), and the large [[Thích Ca Phật Đài]] in [[Vũng Tàu]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dr.lib.sjp.ac.lk/bitstream/123456789/1677/1/Therav%C4%81da%20Buddhism%20in%20Vietnam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David M. Rosenthal''' is a philosopher at the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY) who has made significant contributions to the [[philosophy of mind]], particularly in the area of [[consciousness]].  He was educated at the [[University of Chicago]] and then [[Princeton University]].  In addition to philosophy of mind, Rosenthal has research interests in the related field of [[cognitive science]] and is Coordinator of the CUNY Graduate Center's Interdisciplinary Concentration in Cognitive Science.  Rosenthal has also done work in [[philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], [[ancient philosophy]], and 17th-Century rationalism.

==Higher-order thoughts==
Rosenthal is best known for his [[Higher-order theories of consciousness|higher-order-thought (HOT) theory of consciousness]]. He argues that no mental state is conscious if one is not aware of that state; so a mental state is conscious only if one is aware of oneself as being in that state.  And he argues that we are aware of mental states that are conscious by having a thought that one is in that state.  These higher-order thoughts are seldom conscious thoughts, and they are distinct from the states they are about.  The standard mark in everyday contexts and in experimental psychology that distinguishes conscious mental states is that an individual can report the state; we are unable to report mental states that aren't conscious.  Rosenthal argues that it's the higher-order thoughts that accompany conscious states that enable us to make such reports; because we have no such higher-order awareness of mental states that aren't conscious, we can't report them.  Rosenthal has also argued that the higher-order-thought theory fits well with recent findings in psychology and neuropsychology (Lau and Rosenthal 2011).

== Quality-space theory ==
Since mental states are conscious only if one is aware of those states, every mental state can occur without being conscious.  That includes states that exhibit mental qualities, such as the perceptions and bodily sensations that occur in [[subliminal perception]] and in [[blindsight]].  This view goes against many contemporary views, on which mental qualities are tied inextricably to consciousness.  So Rosenthal has developed a "quality-space theory" (also "homomorphism theory") of the mental qualities, which explains what qualitative mental states without appeal to consciousness.  All mental qualities are individuated by their positions in a quality space that pertains to their sensory modality. More specifically, we can define a quality space of the physical perceptible properties that mental qualities enable access to, relying just on the ability to discriminate among those perceptible properties.  Mental qualities, then, are the properties of mental states that make that discriminative capacity possible; so they are fixed by the positions they occupy in a quality space corresponding to the quality space of accessed perceptible properties. Because the quality spaces of perceptible properties are determined solely by the ability to discriminate among sample properties, independently of whether the perceptual states are conscious, mental qualities themselves can occur without being conscious. They occur consciously only when one is aware of oneself as being in the relevant qualitative state, on the HOT theory, when one has the relevant HOT.

== Relation to other theories of consciousness ==
Rosenthal's HOT theory of consciousness resembles in some ways the traditional inner-sense theory, on which we are aware of conscious states by perceiving them. This theory has also come to be known as higher-order perception.  Rosenthal's theory also resembles somewhat the theory of [[Franz Brentano]], on which our awareness of our own mental states is intrinsic to those states.

But the HOT theory avoids various difficulties that face the inner-sense theory, e.g., explaining what sensory modality the higher-order sensing could have (2004). And because the HOTs Rosenthal posits, unlike Brentano's intrinsic awareness, are external to the mental states they make one conscious of, the theory avoids difficulties Brentano's theory encounters about the individuation of mental states, as well as neuropsychological evidence (e.g., [[Benjamin Libet|Libet]]) that mental states occur measurably before they are available for awareness (2004; 2005, ch. 2).

[[Global Workspace Theory|Global-workspace theories]] ([[Stanislas Dehaene]], [[Bernard Baars]]) posit that mental states are conscious in virtue of the wide availability of their content to various processing areas in the brain.  The HOT theory has an advantage over such theories that it can explain the occurrence of conscious state whose content is not thus available, such as relatively peripheral perceptions and thoughts, and unconscious states whose content is widely available, such as repressed psychological states.

First-order theories, such as [[Fred Dretske|Dretske's]] and [[Ned Block|Ned Block's]], deny that a mental state's being conscious consists in some awareness of that state, and so have no easy way to explain the difference between conscious states and mental states that are not conscious.  Rosenthal's HOT theory provides an intuitively natural way to do so.

== Current research ==
Rosenthal is currently working on function of mental states' being conscious, which he argues is minimal, and on explaining why mental states do ever occur consciously if little utility results from their being conscious. He argues that the factors that explain why qualitative states, such as perceptions, often occur consciously are different from the considerations that explain why thoughts and other intentional states often occur consciously.  He gave this talk, 'Consciousness and its Function' at the [[Online Consciousness Conference]]

Rosenthal has also written extensively about the connection between consciousness, thought, and speech, and has edited several anthologies.

The '''''Dictionary of the Holy Quran''''' was prepared in 1969, by [[Malik Ghulam Farid]] (1897–1977), a notable  [[Ahmadiyya]] scholar and Missionary. The author, [[Malik Ghulam Farid]], also edited the five-volume [[The English Commentary of the Holy Quran]], covering about 3000 pages. He writes that during the editing work of the Commentary, he also worked upon the preparation of a Dictionary of the Holy Quran. This dictionary contains more than 1400 Arabic roots with their derivatives. The Arabic words, along with the Arabic letters and particles have been explained in English.

The Roots have been  quoted  with the respective  verses of the Quran where they occur,  thus the Dictionary also forms a sort of concordance of the Holy Quran. The writer says, “The whole project was based on standard dictionaries of Arabic language such as the [[Lisan al-Arab]], the [[Murtaḍá al-Zabīdī|Taj al-'Arus]], the [[Al-Mufradat fi Gharib al-Quran|Mufradat of Imam Raghib]], the [[Arabic-English Lexicon|Arabic English Lexicon by E. W. Lane]] and the [[Aqrab AI-Mawar]] etc.

The current edition has been published by Islam International Publications Limited, “Islamabad”, Sheephatch Lane, Tilford, Surrey GU10 2AQ UK (2006).  {{ISBN|1 85372 821 7}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/DictionaryOfTheHolyQuran Dictionary of the Holy Quran by Malik Ghulam Farid (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dimitrije "Mita" Mitrinović''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Димитрије Мита Митриновић; 21 October 1887 – 28 August 1953) was a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbian]] philosopher, poet, revolutionary, mystic, theoretician of modern painting and traveler.

==Biography==
Mitrinović was born in 1887 into a family of Orthodox faith and Serbian culture at [[Poplat (Berkovići, RS)|Donji Poplat]], municipality [[Berkovići]] in [[Herzegovina]] during the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina (Austro-Hungarian condominium)|Austro-Hungarian occupation]]. His father, Mihailo, was in the service of the Austro-Hungarian government and ran an experimental farm. Dimitrije was educated at [[Mostar Gymnasium]]. As a young student he was the formulator of the principal program of ''Mlada Bosna'', a political movement called [[Young Bosnia]], in his country's struggle for independence from [[Austria-Hungary]] and in the moves to create a united Yugoslavia. During this period Mitrinović edited the Sarajevo literary paper, ''Bosanska Vila'', whose contributors included poets [[Risto Radulović]] and [[Vladimir Gaćinović|Vladimir "Vlado" Gaćinović]]. All three were born a few years apart in the late second half of the nineteenth century and all three have been members of secret political societies illegal in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Of the three friends, only Mitrinović survived World War I (Gaćinović died in 1917 and Radulović died in an Austrian prison camp in 1915).

Having studied history of art in Munich, Mitrinović came to England in 1914 to work for the Serbian Legation in London and moved among influential cultural circles in this country. From late 1914 to early 1915, there was an exhibition of work by [[Ivan Meštrović]] at the Victoria and Albert Museum, which included a model of a monument he had designed to commemorate the [[Battle of Kosovo]].

A mysterious personality in [[Serbia]]n and European cultural history, he began his work in the field of art by translating ''[[Rig-Veda]]'' and the works of [[Virgil]] into Serbian. He studied philosophy and art history while staying in [[Rome]], [[Madrid]], Paris, [[Munich]], and [[Tübingen]]. He was one of the first advocates of the avant-garde artistic group [[Der Blaue Reiter]] and gave a lecture on the art of [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Being in favour of the building of a universal utopia, like many of the leading minds of his time, he wrote about the inevitable creation of the Pan-European community. Ten years before ''La rebellion de las masas'' by [[José Ortega y Gasset|Ortega y Gasset]], Mitrinović prophesied: "Being different from the other races, the population of Europe has always given birth to its contradictions and always with the chances of their solution in some ultimate synthesis."

He was a regular contributor to the epoch-making periodical ''[[The New Age]]'' (the author of the column "World Affairs"), alongside [[Ezra Pound]], and according to [[Edwin Muir]], Mitrinović "has erupted with wild and profound contemplations ... not looking several ages ahead, like [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] or [[H.G. Wells|Wells]], but several millennia ahead."

The Utopian and messianic ideas of Mitrinović (incorporating  the philosophical concepts of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Demianovich Ouspensky]], the theosophical doctrine of [[G. I. Gurdjieff]], and the psychoanalytical school of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]]) were brought to the attention of the public not only in the periodical ''The New Age'' but also in the periodical ''The New Atlantis'' (which Mitrinović edited) and ''The New Albion'' (which he co-edited with [[A.R. Orage]]).

Mitrinović founded the ''Adler's Society'' (the English Branch of the International Society for Individual Psychology), but later he and Adler went different ways due, allegedly, to "politicizing of his scientific concepts".  Mitrinović later founded ''the New Europe Group''.

Mitrinović advocated a metaphysical Utopia (based on [[Plotinus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Lao Tzu]], [[Jakob Böhme]]) but was also politically pragmatic. He published an open letter to [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933 in which he accused Hitler of "behaving and acting as an evil superman ... possessed with some weird vision" which is "uncomprehendable by the human mind and belief and quite certain, and in all forms and essence, directed against the Orthodox soul."

The works of Mitrinović have remained scattered in numerous European periodicals (like the provocative texts based on psychological and philosophical theories, such as: ''Frojd prema Adleru'' (Freud versus Adler), ''Značaj Jungovog dela'' (The Importance of Jung's Work), ''Marks i Niče kao istorijska pozadina Adlera'' ([[Marx]] and [[Nietzsche]] being the Historical Background of Adler), ''Načela genija'' (The Principles of a Genius), ''Carstvo snova'' (The Realm of Dreams).  Many of his works (including much of his poetry) were published in Serbian periodicals, and one of his major works, ''Aesthetic Contemplations'', was published in ''Bosanska Vila''.

In addition to the selected works of Dimitrije Mitrinović (published in the [[Serbian language]], a number of years after his death) and the special study by [[Predrag Palavestra]], ''Dogma i utopija'' (Dogma and Utopia), in the Serbian language in 1977), two books have been distributed by [[Columbia University Press]], New York; the first of them was published in 1984 and the second one in 1987. The authors of these books are Andrew Rigby (''Initiation and Initiative: An Exploration of the Life and Ideas of Dimitrije Mitrinović'') and H. C. Rutherford (''Certainly Future: Selected Writings by Dimitrije Mitrinović'').

In 1914, wishing to establish the movement "The Fundamentals of the Future", he maintained correspondence with the following potential associates: [[Giovanni Papini]], [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Gershom Scholem]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[H.G. Wells]], [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Filippo T. Marinetti]], [[Anatole France]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], and [[Knut Hamsun]].

==Library and archive==
The Mitrinović Library contains a collection of over 4,500 volumes, based on Mitrinović's private collection. The Library thus reflects Mitrinović's very wide range of interests and command of languages. Particular areas of strength are [[philosophy]], [[politics]], [[society]], [[religion]]s and [[esotericism|esoterica]]. The collection includes rare books on [[art history]], [[literature]], [[psychology]], history, [[science]], [[oriental studies]], [[astrology]], [[Freemasonry]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and more. Most material is from the nineteenth and early twentieth century; the main languages used are English and German, with some French, Asian, and Eastern European languages.

Part of the library was bequeathed to the [[Belgrade University Library]] in 1956 and part of it donated to [[University of Bradford]] in 2003 and 2004.

The archive, which was donated to the ''University of Bradford'' by the Foundation of ''New Atlantis'' in 2003 and 2004, includes published and unpublished writings of Mitrinović and documents and correspondence produced by members of Mitrinović's circle, members of the ''New Europe Group'' and members of the ''New Atlantis Foundation''.

'''Estanislao Zuleta''' (1935 in [[Medellín]], [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] – 1990 in [[Cali]], [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle]]) was a Latin American philosopher, writer and professor from [[Colombia]]. He was known especially for his works on the universities being a professor for all his life. More important than his writings, Zuleta is remembered by his conferences that were carefully recorded by his colleagues and pupils and published several times during his life and after his death in 1990. He dedicated especially to philosophy, Latin American economy, [[psychology]] and education. He let treaties on ancient and modern thinkers of a rich social and historical analysis over the Latin American cultural context. He was an adviser in the United Nations, the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Colombia)|Colombian Ministry of Agriculture]], the Colombian Institute for the Agrarian Reform (Incora), an adviser of former president [[Belisario Betancur Cuartas]] and a writer for Crisis Magazine of [[Medellín]]. He was rewarded by the ''[[Honoris Causa]]'' in psychology of [[University of Valle]] in 1980. The Estanislao Zuleta Foundation is the institution that keeps and promotes the legacy of the Colombian philosopher.

==Life==

Zuleta was born in [[Medellín]] on February 3, 1935 from a family of intellectuals. His father died on June 24, 1935 in the same plane crash that killed the famous [[Tango music|Tango]] composer and singer [[Carlos Gardel]] in his visit to the Colombian Andean city. He was also a disciple of the Colombian philosopher [[Fernando González (writer)|Fernando González Ochoa]].

Zuleta who was to be one of the most famous Colombian lecturers, abandoned the school when he was just a teenager to become an [[autodidact]]. This led to a serious and passionate study philosophy reading many of the classics of universal philosophy, literature, history, art and social science. His deep knowledge the material read was expressed in his articles, books and his memorable conferences given in many universities of the nation.

One of his most dedicated studies was Latin American political economy of which he started to make conferences in [[Bogotá]] in 1963 especially in the [[National University of Colombia]] and [[Universidad Libre]]. He became professor in both universities teaching law and philosophy.

In 1969 he went to Cali to work in [[Universidad Santiago de Cali]], where he became vice-rector. From Cali he returned to his native Medellín to teach in the [[University of Antioquia]].

=== Professor and research ===

Zuleta was not only a professor, but he dedicated his life to investigation in different areas of like [[social economy]] and education at the centers where he was working. Finally he settled in the city of Cali where he worked at the University of Valle and Universidad Santiago de Cali.

In 1980 the University of Valle gave him the ''[[Honoris Causa]]'' for his research in psychology and in the day of the ceremony he read one of the most famous treaties in Colombia: "''Praise to Difficulty''" (''Elogio a la Dificultad''). He remained at the University of Valle for the remainder of his life, and finally died in Cali on February 17, 1990 at the age of 55.

Zuleta founded several newspapers and magazines, such as ''Crisis'' (1957), ''Agitacion'' (1962) and ''Estrategias'' (1963).

==Thought==

Zuleta was also known as a well-respected scholar of philosophy specializing in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[History of philosophy#Ancient philosophy|philosophers]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], among others.

'''Felidae Conservation Fund''' (FCF) is a [[California]]-based [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to preserving [[wild cats]] and their habitats. The organization supports and promotes international wild cat research and conservation by collaborating on field research projects, partnering with other environmental organizations, and developing community outreach and education programs.

==History==
FCF was founded in 2006 by [[conservation movement|conservationist]] and entrepreneur [[Zara McDonald]]. As a competitive [[marathon]] runner, McDonald twice encountered [[mountain lions]] during solitary runs in the [[Marin Headlands]] in Northern California. These encounters led her to become involved in California mountain lion research in 2002, and she soon expanded her research work to include other wild cat species. In the fall of 2004, after returning from extended capture work with mountain lions, she began developing a conservation model that combined scientific research with education and outreach programs. This led her to found the Felidae Conservation Fund ([[501(c)(3)]]) in April 2006.

Today Felidae supports and collaborates in scientific research projects in nine countries, promotes community-level education and outreach programs, and fosters international cooperation among scientists, conservationists, governments, and environmental [[NGO]]s.  Felidae is based in [[Sausalito, California]], and raises money through donations, grants, fundraising events and online [[social networking service|social networks]].

==Mission and philosophy==
FCF's mission is to advance the conservation of the planet's wild cat species and their habitats through partnerships in research, education and technology. Its model is to collaborate on research studies that examine human impact on wild cats and their habitats, then disseminate the results in outreach and education programs designed to convince people of the importance of preserving the natural environment. Felidae collaborates with scientists, educators, communities and lawmakers with the goal of protecting [[ecosystem]]s, staving off further [[extinction]]s, and promoting healthy ways for humans to coexist with wild cats and their habitats.

Felidae's focus on wild cat conservation is motivated by the belief that the study of wild cats can serve as a leverage point for addressing the broader environmental issues of [[habitat loss]], [[Environmental sociology|human-nature interactions]], and [[wildlife conservation|wildlife sustainability]]. This belief is based on the idea that because cats are often the top [[predator]]s in the ecosystems they inhabit, understanding and solving the problems they face can inform and guide the conservation and preservation of wild animals and wild habitats of all kinds.

==Programs==
Felidae currently collaborates on research projects in field locations around the globe, including the [[United States]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Iran]], [[Namibia]] and [[Pakistan]]. Felidae provides strategic guidance, funding, field support, supplies and equipment to its project partners to help them achieve their research goals.

To link this scientific research to conservation efforts, Felidae incorporates the results of field studies into its outreach and education programs. These include talks and presentations throughout the US, collaborations with artists and video producers to convey the conservation message through visual media, and online projects aimed at educating young people through an [[web portal|interactive portal]], an [[browser game|online]] and [[mobile phone]] game, and social network activities.

==Partnerships and collaboration==
In its field work and conservation efforts FCF collaborates with the following organizations: [[National Park Service]], [[California State Parks]], [[California Department of Fish and Game]], [[UC Santa Cruz]], [[UC Davis]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], [[Wildlife Conservation Research Unit]], [[Snow Leopard Trust]], [[Snow Leopard Conservancy]], [[International Wildlife Film Festival]], [[Craighead Beringa South]], [[Cheetah Conservation Fund]] and the [[International League of Conservation Photographers]], among many other organizations.

==Science and research==
Felidae's scientific research projects are based in field locations around the globe.

The '''[[Bay Area Puma Project]]''' in Northern California is the first comprehensive study of mountain lions in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. A primary goal of this study is to determine priority locations for [[wildlife crossing|wildlife overpasses and underpasses]] to maintain connectivity for the region's wildlife populations. In addition, the study uses [[GPS]] collars equipped with [[accelerometer]]s to record detailed information on mountain lion movements that will reveal new insights into their behavior and [[physiology]]. Felidae is working with Dr. Chris Wilmers of UC Santa Cruz, along with the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] and California State Parks.

The '''[[Patagonia]] Puma Project''' in Chile is a long-term ecological study by Dr. Heiko Wittmer of UC Davis which examines the dynamics relating to the puma’s role in the decline of the [[hippocamelus|huemul]] deer. The researchers hope to exonerate the puma from major blame in the huemul's decline.

The '''Bornean Wild Cat and Clouded Leopard Project''' in Malaysia investigates the conservation needs of five species of Bornean wild cats ([[Bornean clouded leopard]], [[bay cat]], [[flat-headed cat]], [[marbled cat]], and [[leopard cat]]). The study will use GPS collars and radio tracking to document spatial patterns, [[ranging]] behavior, activity patterns, and habitat use. Felidae is working in partnership with the Global Canopy Programme ([[UK]]), the Institute for Tropical Biology and Conservation at the University of Malaysia, and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[graduate school|graduate students]] Andrew Hearn and Joanna Ross.

The '''Study on Endangered [[snow leopard|Snow Leopards]]''' in Mongolia is a long-term research project that will answer basic ecological and behavioral questions about the mysterious and elusive snow leopard. The study will be conducted using GPS collars, non-invasive [[genetics]], and [[camera trap]]ping with advanced [[mark-recapture]] modeling. It will attempt to answer basic questions about snow leopards ([[birth rate|birth]] and [[mortality rate]]s, cub survival, [[biological dispersal|dispersal rates]], habitat use, and [[home range]] size) that are currently unknown due to their cryptic nature and inaccessible habitat. Felidae's partners in the project are the [[Snow Leopard Trust]] and the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]].

The '''[[Teton Range|Teton]] [[Cougar]] Project''' in [[Wyoming]] studies the [[population dynamics]] of mountain lions in the [[Greater Yellowstone ecosystem]] by examining predation, behavior associated with human development, and interactions with [[wolf|wolves]], [[grizzly bear]]s and [[American black bear|black bears]]. The project is operated by Craighead Beringia South with support from Felidae.

The '''Southern California Puma Project''' examines the progress and implications of [[habitat fragmentation]] as puma populations in Southern California become more isolated. Felidae is collaborating with UC Davis Wildlife Health Center on this study, which has radio-collared more than 50 pumas over 7 years.

The '''[[Asiatic cheetah|Asiatic Cheetah]] Project''' in Iran is the first detailed ecological study of the [[critically endangered]] Asiatic cheetah. Researchers in Northern Iran work to gain insight into the cheetahs’ movements within and between reserves, information that can help scientists to protect the cats' habitat and stave off extinction.

The '''Snow Leopard Conservation Project''' in Pakistan is a high-profile study in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North Western Frontier Province]] of Pakistan in which the first ever GPS collar was placed on a snow leopard, as seen in the [[BBC]] documentary [[Natural World (TV series)|"Snow Leopard: Beyond the Myth"]]. The study is a partnership between Snow Leopard Trust, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]-Pakistan, NWFP Wildlife Department, and Felidae Conservation Fund.

The '''[[Southern African cheetah|African Cheetah]] Project''' in Namibia is an ongoing study of the African cheetah that includes camera-trapping, [[spoor (animal)|spoor]] tracking, and [[DNA]] research. The study is led by the [[Cheetah Conservation Fund]] and Dr. Laurie Marker with support from Felidae.

'''Feminist justice ethics''' is a [[feminist]] view on morality which seeks to engage with, and ultimately transform, traditional universal approaches to [[ethics]].&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 68"&gt;Hutchings, Kimberley. "Ethics." In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Laura J Shepherd, 68. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most types of feminist ethics, feminist justice ethics looks at how gender is left out of mainstream ethical considerations.  Mainstream ethics are argued to be male-oriented.  However, feminist justice ethics does differ considerably from other feminist ethics.  A universal set of ethics is a significant part of feminist justice ethics.&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 69"&gt;Hutchings, Kimberley. "Ethics." In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Laura J Shepherd, 69. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Feminist justice ethics is clear in dividing "thick" morality from "thin" morality.  Other ethical approaches that define themselves by differentiating groups from one another through culture or other phenomena are regarded as "thick" accounts of morality.  Feminist justice ethics claims that "thick" accounts of morality, as opposed to "thin" accounts of morality, are intrinsically prone to eroding valid feminist critique.&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 68"/&gt;

== Overview ==
Feminist justice ethics is part of a range of feminist ethical perspectives.  Other popular feminist approaches to ethics include feminist [[ethics of care]], and feminist [[postmodern]] ethics.  The implementation of a feminist ethic of care often draws critique from feminist justice ethics.  Feminist ethics of care is premised by the idea that morality is shaped by relational versions of our self.  Our moral relations take precedence.&lt;ref name="Robinson 2011 847"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Fiona|title=Stop Talking and Listen: Discourse Ethics and Feminist Care Ethics in International Political Theory|journal=Millennium - Journal of International Studies|year=2011|volume=39|issue=3|page=847|doi=10.1177/0305829811401176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feminist justice ethics differs itself from feminist ethics of care by chastising such a perspective for its abandonment of universal values.  In feminist justice ethics, legitimate ethical critique cannot be made without utilizing a universal set of ethics.&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 67"&gt;Hutchings, Kimberley. "Ethics." In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Laura J Shepherd, 67. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, feminist postmodern ethics puts forth an entirely different view.  A feminist postmodern perspective will perceive androcentricity in many aspects of life, including [[epistemology]].  At the same time feminist postmodernism will deny the existence of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] within our world. This claim is based on the notion that knowledge is subjectively constructed.&lt;ref name="Strong 1996 65"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strong|first=Kelly C.|title=A Postmodern Feminist Perspective on Organizations in the Natural Environment: Rethinking Ecological Awareness|journal=Business &amp; Society|year=1996|volume=35|issue=1|page=65|doi=10.1177/000765039603500105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One feminist postmodern scholar has implicated the ethical outcomes of modern business norms as a result of this masculine-dominated society.&lt;ref name="Strong 1996 65-66"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strong|first=Kelly C.|title=A Postmodern Feminist Perspective on Organizations in the Natural Environment: Rethinking Ecological Awareness|journal=Business &amp; Society|year=1996|volume=35|issue=1|pages=65–66|doi=10.1177/000765039603500105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Friction between feminist justice ethics and feminist postmodern ethics exists on the principle of universality.  The former supports the idea of universal values, while the latter denies such values exist because it denies objectivity.&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 69"/&gt;
Since a universal view on morality is typical in feminist justice ethics, the question arises: what specific values are actually universal?  Nussbaum's capabilities approach attempts to tackle this question, and lists several traits she believes to be universal:&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloodworth 2006 59"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloodworth|first=Andrew|title=Nussbaum's 'Capabilities Approach'|journal=Nursing Philosophy|year=2006|volume=7|issue=1|page=59|doi=10.1111/j.1466-769x.2006.00240.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Life – ability to live out a natural lifespan;
# Bodily Health – ability to have good health including reproductive health, adequate nourishment, shelter;
# Bodily Integrity – freedom of movement, security from physical violation, sexual and reproductive autonomy;
# Senses, Imagination and Thought – ability to use all of these fully in an educated way;
# Emotions – ability to be able to be attached to others, to have a capacity for love and affection;
# Practical Reason – to be able to reflect rationally, identify one’s own conception of the good life and plan for it;
# Affiliation – ability to live with others in personal relationships and social communities; 
# Other Species – ability to live in relation to nature;
# Play – ability to enjoy recreation;
# Control over one’s material and political environment – ability to participate in political choices, ability to hold property, to work on equal terms with others.

== Criticisms ==

===Feminist ethics of care===
Feminist ethics of care disagrees with feminist justice ethics on some issues.  Feminist ethics of care critiques feminist justice ethics with the claim that by lumping women into universal categories of being, the emphasis on distinct virtues that may be held primarily by women is lost.  This loss of emphasis leads back to the [[masculine]] norms that feminist ethics are attempting to critique.&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 69"/&gt;

===Feminist postmodern ethics===
Feminist postmodern ethics may cite a number of factors.  One source of concern would be the universality that is presented by many feminist justice ethicists.  Feminist postmodern ethics is heavily reliant on deconstructing society and critiquing objectivity.&lt;ref name="Strong 1996 65"/&gt;  Another point of concern regarding Nussbaum's argument in particular is that feminist justice ethics may ignore women who do not belong to Western cultures.  By assuming ethics from a Western point of view, other views on ethics may be lost or seen as inferior.&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 69-70"&gt;Hutchings, Kimberley. "Ethics." In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Laura J Shepherd, 69-70. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Eduard Beneke''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbeːnəkə|lang}}; 17 February 1798 – c. 1 March 1854) was a [[Germany|German]] [[psychologist]] and [[post-Kantian]]&lt;ref name=Sperber/&gt; [[philosopher]].

== Early life ==
Beneke was born in [[Berlin]]. He studied at the universities of [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], and served as a volunteer in the [[Hundred Days|War of 1815]].  After studying [[theology]] under [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] and [[Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette|de Wette]], he turned to pure [[philosophy]], studying [[England|English]] writers and the German modifiers of [[Kantianism]], such as [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. In 1820, he published ''Erkenntnisslehre'', ''Erfahrungsseelenlehre als Grundlage alles Wissens'', and his inaugural dissertation ''De Veris Philosophiae Initiis''. His marked opposition to the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], then dominant in Berlin, was shown more clearly in the short tract, ''Neue Grundlegung zur Metaphysik'' (1822), intended to be the programme for his lectures as ''Privatdozent'', and in the able treatise, ''Grundlegung zur Physik der Sitten'' (1822), written, in direct antagonism to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'', to deduce ethical principles from a basis of empirical feeling. In 1822 his lectures were prohibited in Berlin, because of the influence of Hegel with the [[Prussia]]n authorities, who also prevented him from obtaining a chair from the [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]] government. He retired to [[university of Göttingen|Göttingen]], lectured there for several years, and was then allowed to return to Berlin. In 1832 he received an appointment as ''professor extraordinarius'' at the university, which he continued to hold till his death. On 1 March 1854 he disappeared, and more than two years later his remains were found in the canal near [[Charlottenburg]]. There was some suspicion that he had committed suicide in a fit of mental depression.

== Work in psychology ==
The distinctive features of Beneke's system are the firmness with which he maintained that in empirical psychology is to be found the basis of all philosophy, and his rigid treatment of mental phenomena by the genetic method. According to Beneke, the perfected mind is a development from simple elements, and the first problem of philosophy is the determination of these elements and of the processes by which the development takes place. In his ''Neue Psychologie'' (essays iii., viii. and ix.), he defined his position with regard to his predecessors and contemporaries. This and the introduction to his ''Lehrbuch'' signaled the two great stages in tile progress of psychology the negation of innate ideas by [[John Locke]], and of faculties, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, by [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]]. The next step was his own; he insisted that psychology must be treated as one of the natural sciences. As is the case with them, its content is given by experience alone, and differs from theirs only in being the object of the internal as opposed to the external sense. But by this Beneke in no wise meant a psychology founded on [[physiology]]. These two sciences, in his opinion, had quite distinct provinces and gave no mutual assistance. Just as little help is to be expected from the science of the body as from [[mathematics]] and [[metaphysics]], both of which had been pressed by Herbart into the service of psychology. The true method of study is that applied with so much success in the physical sciences: critical examination of the given experience, and reference of it to ultimate causes, which may not be perceived, but are nevertheless hypotheses necessary to account for the facts. (See on method, ''Neue Psych.'', essay i.)

Starting from the two assumptions that there is nothing, or at least no formed product, innate in the mind, and that definite faculties do not originally exist, and from the fact that our minds nevertheless actually have a definite content and definite modes of action, Beneke proceeds to state somewhat dogmatically his scientifically verifiable hypotheses as to the primitive condition of the soul and the laws according to which it develops. Originally the soul is possessed of or is an immense variety of powers, faculties or forces (conceptions which Beneke, in opposition to Herbart, holds to be metaphysically justifiable), differing from one another only in tenacity, vivacity, receptivity and grouping. These primitive immaterial forces, so closely united as to form but one being ([[essence]]), acquire definiteness or form through the action upon them of stimuli or excitants from the outer world. This action of external impressions which are appropriated by the internal powers is the first fundamental process in the genesis of the completed mind. If the union of impression and faculty be sufficiently strong, [[consciousness]] (not [[self-consciousness]]) arises, and definite [[Sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s and [[perception]]s begin to be formed. These primitive sensations, however, are not to be identified with the special senses, for each of these senses is a system of many powers which have grown into a definite unity, have been educated by experience. From ordinary experience it must be concluded that a second fundamental process is incessantly going on: the formation of new powers, which takes place principally during sleep. The third and most important process results from the fact that the combination between stimulus and power may be weak or strong; if weak, then tile two elements are said to be movable, and they may flow over from one to another of the already formed psychical products. Any formed faculty does not cease to exist on the removal of its stimulus; in virtue of its fundamental property, tenacity, it sinks back as a trace (''Spur'') into [[unconsciousness]], whence it may be recalled by the application to it of another stimulus, or by the attraction towards it of some of the movable elements or newly formed original powers. These traces and the flowing over of the movable elements are the most important conceptions in Beneke's psychology. Through them he gives a rationale of reproduction and association, and strives to show that all the formed faculties are simply developments from traces of earlier processes. Lastly, similar forms, according to the degree of their similarity, attract one another or tend to form closer combinations.

All psychical phenomena are explicable by the relation of impression and power, and by the flow of movable elements; the whole process of [[mental development]] is nothing but the result of the action and interaction of the above simple laws. In general this growth may be said to take the direction of rendering more and more definite by repetition and attraction of like to like tile originally indefinite activities of the primary faculties. Thus, the sensations of the special senses are gradually formed from the primary sensuous feelings (''sensliche Empfindungen''); concepts are formed from intuitions of individuals by the attraction of the common elements, and the consequent flow towards them of movable forms. Judgment is the springing into consciousness of a concept alongside of an intuition, or of a higher concept alongside of a lower. Reasoning is merely a more complex judgment. Nor are there special faculties of judging or reasoning. The understanding is simply the mass of concepts lying in the background of unconsciousness, ready to be called up and to flow with force towards anything closely connected with them. Even memory is not a special faculty; it is simply the fundamental property of tenacity possessed by the original faculties. The very distinction between the three great classes, knowledge, feeling and will, may be referred to elementary differences in the original relations of faculty and impression.

This is the groundwork of Beneke's philosophy. It should be compared with the association psychology of modern British thinkers, most of whose results and processes wiil be found worked into a comprehensive system in Beneke's work. In logic, metaphysics and ethics, Beneke's speculations are naturally dependent on his psychology.

The special value of Beneke's works is found in the many specimens of acute psychological analysis scattered throughout them. As a complete explanation of psychical facts, the theory seems defective. The original hypotheses, peculiar to Beneke, on which the whole depends, are hastily assumed and rest on a clumsy [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanical metaphor]]. As is the case with all empirical theories of mental development, the higher categories or notions, which are apparently shown to result from the simple elements, are really presupposed at every step. Particularly unsatisfactory is the account of consciousness, which is said to arise from the union of impression and faculty. The necessity of consciousness for any mental action whatsoever is apparently granted, but the conditions involved in it are never discussed or mentioned. The same defect appears in the account of ethical judgment; no amount of empirical fact can ever yield the notion of absolute duty. His results have found acceptance mainly with practical teachers. Undoubtedly his minute analysis of [[temperament]] and careful exposition of the means whereby the young, unformed mind may be trained are of infinite value; but the truth of many of his doctrines on these points lends no support to the fundamental hypotheses, from which, indeed, they might be almost entirely severed.

==Influence and school==
German writers who, though not professed followers of Beneke, were influenced by him, include [[Friedrich Ueberweg]] and [[Karl Fortlage]]. In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], the only writer who showed acquaintance with his works is [[J. D. Morell]] (''Introduction to Mental Philosophy'').

The most eminent members of the school are {{ill|Johann Gottlieb Dressler|eo}} (''Beneke oder die Seelenlehre als Naturwissenschaft''), Fried, [[Friedrich Dittes]], and [[Charles Gottlieb Raue]]. The compendium by the last-named author passed through four editions in Germany, and has been translated into French, Flemish and English. The English translation, ''Elements of Psychology'' (1871), gives a lucid and succinct view of the whole system.

== Bibliography ==
Beneke was a prolific writer, and besides the works mentioned above, published large treatises in several departments of philosophy, both pure and as applied to education and ordinary life. A complete list of his writings will be found in the appendix to Dressier's edition of the ''Lehrbuch der Psychologie als Naturwissenschaft'' (1861). The chief ones are:

*''Psychologische Skizzen'' (1825, 1827)
*''Lehrbuch der Psychologie'' (1832)
*''Metaphysik und Religionsphilosophie'' (1840)
*''Die neue Psychologie'' (1845)
*''Pragmatische Psychologie oder Seelenlehre in der Anwendung auf das Leben'' (1832).

'''Gyurme Dorje'''  was born in 1950 in [[Edinburgh]], where he studied classics (Latin and Greek) at [[George Watson's College]] and developed an early interest in Buddhist philosophy.&lt;ref name=Shambhala1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shambhala.com/authors/a-f-1/gyurme-dorje.html |title=Gyurme Dorje |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= |website=Shambhala Publications |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a PhD in Tibetan Literature ([[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]]) and an MA in Sanskrit with Oriental Studies (Edinburgh). In the 1970s he spent a decade living in Tibetan communities in India and Nepal where he received extensive teachings from [[Longchen Yeshe Dorje|Kangyur Rinpoche]], [[Jigdral Yeshe Dorje (2nd Dudjom Rinpoche)|Dudjom Rinpoche]], [[Chatral Sangye Dorje|Chatral Rinpoche]], and [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]]. In 1971 Dudjom Rinpoche encouraged him to begin translating his recently completed ''History of the Nyingma School'' ({{lang|bo|རྙིང་མའི་སྟན་པའི་ཆོས་འབྱུང་}}) and in 1980 his ''Fundamentals of the Nyingma School'' ({{lang|bo|བསྟན་པའི་རྣམ་གཞག}}) - together this was an undertaking that was to take twenty years, only reaching completion in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1 = Dudjom Jigdrel Yeshe Dorje |author-link1=Jigdral Yeshe Dorje (2nd Dudjom Rinpoche) |first2=Gyurme |last2=Dorje |author-link2=Gyurme Dorje  |editor1-last=Kapstein |editor1-first=Matthew |editor1-link=Matthew Kapstein| title=The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals &amp; History |date=1991 |page=xxix|location=Boston |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn=0-86171-087-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s Gyurme returned to the UK and in 1987 completed his 3 volume doctoral dissertation on the ''[[Guhyagarbhatantra]]''  and Longchenpa's commentary on this text at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at the University of London.&lt;ref name=Shambhala1 /&gt; 
 
From 1991 to 1996 Gyurme held research fellowships at London University, where he worked with [[Alak Zenkar Rinpoche]] on translating (with corrections) the content of the Great Sanskrit Tibetan Chinese Dictionary to create the three volume ''Encyclopaedic Tibetan-English Dictionary''.  He has written, edited, translated and contributed to numerous important books on Tibetan religion and culture including ''The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History'' (2 vol.) (Wisdom, 1991), ''Tibetan Medical Paintings'' 2 vol. (Serindia, 1992), ''The Tibet Handbook'' (Footprint, 1996), the first complete translation of the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'', and ''A Handbook of Tibetan Culture'' (Shambhala, 1994).

==Personal life==

Gyurme Dorje is married to Xiaohong Dorje and currently lives in Crieff, Scotland. He has two daughters, Pema and Tinley, as well as a son, Orgyn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2842">'''Heymeric de Campo'''&lt;ref&gt;Heymeric van Kempen, Heymeric van den Velde.&lt;/ref&gt; (1395–1460) was a Dutch theologian and scholastic philosopher. He was a prominent [[Albertist]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521772242&amp;ss=exc The Cambridge Companion to Reformation Theology - Cambridge University Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/albert-great/ Albert the Great (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and forerunner of [[Nicholas of Cusa]]. He studied at the [[University of Paris]], and taught at [[Cologne]] (where Nicholas studied under him&lt;ref&gt;H. Lawrence Bond (ed.), ''Selected Spiritual Writings by Nicholas of Cusa'' (1997), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Old University of Leuven|Leuven]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorge J. E. Gracia, Timothy B. Noone (editors), ''A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages'' (2003), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Tractatus Problematicus'' began a series of polemical exchanges between the Albertists and the [[Thomists]]. The first part deals with [[universals]], following closely [[John de Nova Domo]], Heymeric's teacher. A belated reply was made on behalf of the Thomists by [[Gerard de Monte]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tractatus concordiae inter Thomam et Albertum''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul van Geest, Harm J. M. J. Goris, Carlo Leget, Mishtooni Bose, ''Aquinas as Authority: A Collection of Studies'' (2002), p. 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote a commentary on the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;Derk Visser, ''Apocalypse As Utopian Expectation (800-1500): The Apocalypse Commentary of Berengaudus of Ferrieres and the Relationship Between Exegesis, Liturgy and Iconography'' (1996), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2010}}

In [[philosophy]], '''hyle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|l|iː}}; from {{lang-grc|ὕλη}}) refers to [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] or stuff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Laruelle: A Stranger Thought|last=Smith|first=Anthony|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2017|isbn=9780745671222|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be the [[material cause]] underlying a change in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophy. The Greeks originally had no word for matter in general, as opposed to raw material suitable for some specific purpose or other, so Aristotle adapted the word for "wood" to this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, James Morris Whiton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nxoyBcpUuEsC&amp;lpg=PA829&amp;ots=xudfug-SqS&amp;dq=liddell%20and%20scott%20hyle&amp;pg=PA725#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''A lexicon abridged from Liddell &amp; Scott's Greek-English lexicon''] (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1891), 725.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that everything physical is made of the same basic substance holds up well under modern [[science]], although it may be thought of more in terms of [[energy]] or matter/energy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Physical Existence|first=Ivor|last= Leclerc|publisher=Routledge|year= 2004|ISBN=0-415-29561-0|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aristotle's concept ==
The Aristotelian concept of ''hyle'' is the principle that correlates with ''eidos'' (form) and this can be demonstrated in the way the philosopher described ''hyle,'' saying it is that which receives form or definiteness, that which is formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophy of Nature|last=Leclerc|first=Ivor|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press|year=2018|isbn=9780813230863|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle explained that "By ''hyle'' I mean that which in itself is neither a particular thing nor of a certain quantity nor assigned to any other of the categories by which being is determined."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that hyle is brought into existence not due to its being its agent or its own actuality but only when form attaches to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abū’l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī’s Scientific Philosophy: The Kitāb al-Mu‘tabar|last=Pavlov|first=Moshe|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138640450|location=Oxon|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained that the Aristotelian concept should not be understood as a "stuff" since there is, for example, ''hyle'' that is intellectual as well as sensible ''hyle'' found in the body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

For Aristotle, hyle is composed of four elements - fire, water, air, and earth - but these were not considered pure substances since matter and form exist in a combination of hot, moist, dry, and cold so that everything is united to form the elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chemistry Demystified|last=Williams|first=Linda|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|year=2003|isbn=9780071433594|location=New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substance==

The matter of hyle is closely related to that of [[substance theory|substance]], in so far as both endure a change in form, or transformation. Aristotle defined primary substance as that which can neither be predicated nor attributed to something else,&lt;ref name="sep-substance"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Howard |last=Robinson |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2009 |title=Substance |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2009 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2009/entries/substance/#AriAccSub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he explained the transformation between the [[classical elements|four terrestrial elements]] in terms of an abstract primary matter that underlies each element due to the four combinations of two properties: hot or cold and wet or dry. He stipulated that transformations between opposing elements, where both properties differ, must be analyzed as two discrete steps wherein one of the two properties changes to its contrary while the other remains unchanged (see [[essence]] and [[hylomorphism]]).

Modern substance theory differs, for example [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s "Ding an sich", or "[[thing in itself]]", is generally described as whatever is its own cause, or alternatively as a thing whose only property is that it is that thing (or, in other words, that it has only that property). However, this notion is subject to the criticism, as by [[Nietzsche]], that there is no way to ''directly'' prove the existence of any thing which has no properties, since such a thing could not possibly interact with other things and thus would be unobservable and [[indeterminacy in philosophy|indeterminate]].

On the other hand, we may need to postulate a substance that [[endurantism|endures]] through change in order to explain the nature of change—without an enduring factor that persists through change, there is no change but only a succession of unrelated [[event (philosophy)|event]]s. The existence of change is hard to deny, and if we have to postulate something ''unobserved'' in order to explain what ''is'' observed, that is a valid ''indirect'' demonstration (by [[abductive reasoning]]). Moreover, something like a prime substance is posited by [[physics]] in the form of [[matter]]/[[energy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7691">'''Isaac ben Sheshet Perfet''' (1326&amp;ndash;1408) ([[Hebrew]]: יצחק בן ששת) was a Spanish [[Talmudic]] authority, also known by his acronym, '''Rivash''' (ריב"ש). He was born at [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and settled early in life at [[Barcelona]], where he studied at the school of [[Nissim of Gerona]].

== Life ==
Although Isaac, while still young, acquired a worldwide reputation as a Talmudic authority, and [[halakah|halakic]] inquiries were addressed to him from all quarters, he led a private life, earning his livelihood in commerce until he was about fifty years old, when he was compelled to accept a position as [[rabbi]]. Together with six other prominent men of Barcelona, among whom was his younger brother [[Judah ben Sheshet]] and his teacher [[Nissim ben Reuben]], he was thrown into prison on a false accusation. After his acquittal he accepted the rabbinate of [[Zaragoza]]; but troubles still awaited him. To the grief caused by the death of his brother Judah and of his son-in-law was added that due to dissensions in the community, stirred up by the ''[[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayyan]]'' [[Joseph ben David]]. Isaac in consequence accepted the less important rabbinate of [[Calatayud]]; but when he was on the point of leaving Zaragoza the leaders of that community induced him to stay. The peace, however, did not remain long undisturbed, and Isaac settled at Valencia, where he directed a Talmudical school.

In 1391 occurred the great persecutions of the Jews of Spain in consequence of the preaching of [[Fernandes Martinez]]. On the first day of the persecutions, the younger brother of [[John I of Aragon|King John I]], summoned Issac on July 9, 1391. He explained that to be able to restrain and cease the bloodshed, it would be necessary to promulgate an organized conversion of the Jews, which should obviously start with the communal leaders. Some of the leaders did relent to the heavy pressure laid upon them; but not Issac, who held steadfast to his faith. After a couple of days, the officials set up false witnesses to testify against Issac for a disgraceful crime. Due to this accusation, Issac was condemned to death, by [[death by burning|burning at the stake]] in the city's central square. Due to this ruling, Issac thought of the public burning and spreading false accusations against him, as a desecration to him and his religion, more than [[baptism|immersing]] and later escaping and returning to his original faith. On July 11 Issac was immersed, donned the robe of a Dominican and received the name Jaume De-valencia. About a year and a half later, Issac escaped to the Muslim lands in northern Africa, with the help of [[Hasdai Crescas]], where he once again was able to practice the Jewish faith publicly, at about the age of 66-67.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rabbi Hisdai Crescas|last=Harvey|first=Warren Zev|publisher=The Zalman Shazar Center|year=2010|isbn=978-965-227-271-3|location=Israel|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After sojourning a certain time at [[Miliana]] he settled at [[Algiers]], where he was received with great honor.

A certain Spanish refugee who had settled at Algiers before him aspired to become the leader of the community, and, seeing in Isaac a rival, began to persecute him. To give to Isaac the power necessary to act against this man, [[Saul ha-Kohen Astrue]] persuaded the government to appoint Isaac rabbi of Algiers. But this won for him a still more powerful enemy in the person of [[Simeon ben Zemah Duran]], who disapproved of any intervention on the part of the government in the affairs of the rabbinate.

Notwithstanding these events, Isaac was greatly venerated by the Algerian Jews, and pilgrimages to his tomb are still made on the anniversary of his death, which occurred in 1408. His tombstone was restored by the community of Algiers in 1862. It bears a [[Hebrew]] elegy, composed by [[Abba Mari]] ibn Caspi, and the following French inscription: "Ce monument a été restauré par la communauté Israélite d'Alger en I'honneur du Rabbin Isaac bar Chichat, né en Espagne, décédé à Alger en 1408, dans sa 82 année. Alger le 11 août, 1862." The accuracy of the date of his death given in this epitaph is, however, questioned by some scholars, who claim with some authority that Isaac died at least one year later.

== Works ==
Isaac was the author of 518 ''[[responsa]]'', to which great halakic value is attached by men like [[Joseph Caro]], [[Jacob Berab]], and many others. They are also of great historical importance as reflecting the conditions of Jewish life in the fourteenth century. In some of them are to be found details of the author's life; but unfortunately it is impossible to trace these chronologically, the original order of the responsa having been altered by the editors.

Although Isaac was very strict in his halakic decisions, he was far from being narrow-minded. He has nothing to say against secular knowledge; he disapproves the study of [[Aristotle]] only because the latter professed belief in the eternity of matter and denied God's providence. Isaac's ''responsa'' evidence a profound knowledge of the philosophical writings of his time. In one of them (No. 118) he explains the difference between the opinion of [[Levi ben Gershom]] and that of [[Abraham ben David of Posquières]] on [[free will]], and gives his own views on that complicated subject. He shows himself a decided adversary of the [[Kabbalah]]. His teacher says Isaac never spoke of the ''[[Sefirot]]'', and Isaac cites the words of one of the philosophizers&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew: אחד מן המתפלספים.&lt;/ref&gt; who reproaches the kabbalists with believing in the ten (Sefirot) as the [[Christians]] believe in the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt; ([http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/shotharibash/shotharibash03.pdf#page=12 No. 157])&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac's ''responsa'' were first published, under the title ''She'elot u-Teshubot'', at [[Constantinople]] in 1546-47. A newer collection of the responsa was published under the title ''She'elot u-Teshubot ha-Ribash ha-Ḥadashot'' by David Frenkl at [[Mukacheve|Muncas]]. In addition to these, he wrote novellæ on the [[Talmud]] which are no longer in existence. They are mentioned by him in his responsa (No. 106), and some of them, on the treatise Ketubot, are cited by [[Bezalel Ashkenazi]] in the ''Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet''. [[Azulai]] says that he has seen a manuscript containing a commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] by Isaac ben Sheshet.

'''James Alexander''' (May 27, 1691 – April 2, 1756) was a lawyer and statesman in [[Province of New York|colonial New York]]. He served in the Colonial Assembly and as attorney general of the colony in 1721–23. His son [[William Alexander (American general)|William]] was later a major general in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|American revolution]]. [[Alexandria Township, New Jersey]] was named after James Alexander.

==Early life==
Alexander was born in Muthill in Perthshire, [[Scotland]] on May 27, 1691, to David Alexander ("of Muthil").&lt;ref name="Bell1997"/&gt; He was a distant relation of the [[Earl of Stirling]] and may have received his formal education at the [[High School of Stirling]].&lt;ref name="Bell1997"/&gt;

He joined the navy, serving on the HMS ''Arundell'' in 1712–13, where he learned navigation, mathematics, and astronomy.&lt;ref name="Bell1997"/&gt; But in 1714–15, he joined the uprising in support of [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the [[Prince of Wales]], and fled to America in 1715 when it failed.&lt;ref name="hsnyc"/&gt;

==Life in America==
In November 1715, he was appointed surveyor general of New Jersey.&lt;ref name="ColDames1913"&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Register of the National Society of Colonial Dames in the State of New York|date=1913|publisher=National Society of Colonial Dames in the State of New York|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fSl4TYMReSwC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He personally made surveys, using instruments he had brought from Scotland and resolved disputed titles.  Alexander settled in New York, and in January 1721 after marrying, he was appointed deputy-secretary of New York.&lt;ref name="hsnyc"&gt;{{cite web|title=James Alexander|url=https://www.nycourts.gov/history/legal-history-new-york/legal-history-eras-01/history-era-01-alexander.html|website=www.nycourts.gov|publisher=Historical Society of the New York Courts|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal career===
Alexander [[read law]] in New York and was admitted to the provincial bar of New Jersey in 1720. He served as attorney general for the colony of New York from 1721 to 1723. Alexander sought membership of [[Gray’s Inn]] in February 1, 1725, and returned from London with a large legal library that enabled him to cite legal precedent in court. This was a distinct advantage for a colonial lawyer.&lt;ref name=hsnyc/&gt; [[James Duane]], ward and later son-in-law of [[Robert Livingston (1708–1790)|Robert Livingston]], third Lord of [[Livingston Manor]], [[Reading law|read law]] as a clerk in Alexander's office and became proficient in the area of rights and jurisdiction in land disputes.&lt;ref name="Lamb2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamb|first1=Martha Joanna|last2=Harrison|first2=Mrs Burton|title=History of the City of New York: Its Origin, Rise, and Progress|date=2005|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=9781596052840|page=701|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JvSsT6J6qoC&amp;pg=PA701&amp;lpg=PA701|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander practiced law, engaged in mercantile pursuits, and built a considerable fortune.&lt;ref name="anb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Purvis|first1=Thomas L.|title=Alexander, James (1691-1756), political leader {{!}} American National Biography|url=https://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-0100012|website=anb.org|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en|doi=10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-0100012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He built a large brick mansion at [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad]] and Beaver Streets.&lt;ref name="Bell1997"/&gt;

===Politics===
In 1721, Alexander was appointed to the Governor's Council in New York.  In 1723, he was added to the Council in New Jersey and that same year made Attorney General of New Jersey.  He frequently opposed the policies of New York Governor [[William Cosby]] and in 1732, Cosby succeeded in having Alexander removed from the Council.&lt;ref name=hsnyc/&gt;  In 1733, Alexander started an anti-Cosby newspaper, the ''New York Weekly Journal'', with [[John Peter Zenger|Peter Zenger]] as publisher.  Alexander was the principal author of pieces critical of Governor Cosby. The following year, Zenger was arrested on [[sedition]] charges, but eventually a jury acquitted Zenger in one of the first instances of [[jury nullification]].&lt;ref name="founders"&gt;{{cite web|title=From Benjamin Franklin to James Alexander, 15 August 1745|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-03-02-0012|website=founders.archives.gov|publisher=Founders Online|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander and [[William Smith (judge)|William Smith]] served as Zenger's attorneys until both were disbarred after they challenged the commissions of the judges hearing the case.&lt;ref name=Linder&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/keyfigures.html Linder, Douglas O., "Key Figures in the Trial of John Peter Zenger", ''Famous Trials'', University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1730, Alexander was chairman of the committee to revise the New York City charter; he was given the freedom of the city the following year.&lt;ref name="Bell1997"/&gt; When Lord De La Warr was appointed governor in 1737, Alexander was reinstated to the bar&lt;ref name=Linder/&gt; and reappointed to the governor's Council of New York.  His removal from the  Council of New Jersey was disregarded. Alexander became a vocal proponent of the emerging Whig political views, and engaged in various civic efforts as well.  In 1751, he raised funds to establish [[Columbia University|King's College]].&lt;ref name="nypl"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Peter Zenger trial collection|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/37|website=archives.nypl.org|publisher=[[The New York Public Library]]|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Although he remained active in politics, his legal practice eventually absorbed most of his time and energy, and his political involvement waned. He was an original member of the [[American Philosophical Society]],&lt;ref name="Bell1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=Whitfield Jenks|title=Patriot-improvers: 1743-1768|date=1997|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|isbn=9780871692269|pages=87-93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKBKSiIICH8C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1743 by [[Benjamin Franklin]], Alexander, [[Francis Hopkinson]], [[John Bartram]], [[Philip Syng|Philip Syng, Jr.]] and others&lt;ref&gt;Duer, William Alexander.

==Early life==
Jaun Elia was born on 14 December 1931 in [[Amroha]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/spectrum/society/in-search-of-jaun-elia/641825.html|title=In search of Jaun Elia|last=|first=|date=|work=The Tribune , India|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest of his siblings. [[Rais Amrohvi]] was his elder brother. His father, Shafiq Hasan Elia, worked in art and literature. Shafiq was also an [[astrologer]] and a poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rekhta.org/poets/jaun-eliya|title=Ghazals of Jaun Eliya {{!}} Rekhta|website=Rekhta|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian film director [[Kamal Amrohi]] was his first cousin.&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1097578 |author=Manzoor Kureshi|title=In the name of father|publisher=[[DAWN (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=4 April 2014|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his youth, [[Pakistan]] became an [[Pakistan Movement|independent]] [[Muslim]] state. Being a communist, Elia was averse to the idea, but finally accepted it as a compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rekhta.org/poets/jaun-eliya|title=Ghazals of Jaun Eliya {{!}} Rekhta|website=Rekhta|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He migrated to Pakistan in 1957, and decided to live in [[Karachi]]. Poet [[Pirzada Qasim]] said:
{{quote|Jaun was very particular about language. While his diction is rooted in the [[classicism|classical]] tradition, he touches on new subjects. He remained in quest of an ideal all his life. Unable to find the ideal eventually, he became angry and frustrated. He felt, perhaps with reason, that he had squandered his talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Urdu Literature (2 Vols.

== Religious view ==
Jaun Elia was a [[Shia Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tns.thenews.com.pk/who-would-kill-jaun-elia/|title=Who would kill Jaun Elia? - TNS - The News on Sunday|date=2014-06-22|website=TNS - The News on Sunday|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Klein''' (October 19, 1912 – February 22, 1998) was a [[France|French]] author, spiritual teacher and philosopher of [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[Nondualism]]).&lt;ref name=int&gt;[http://www.nonduality.com/klein.htm Dr. Jean Klein and Advaita Vedanta, by Andrew Rawlinson].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jean Klein, it is only in a "spontaneous state of interior silence that we can open ourselves to our true nature: the 'I Am' of pure consciousness."{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Biography==
Jean Klein was born in Berlin and spent his childhood in [[Brno]] and [[Prague]]. He studied musicology and medicine in [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]], becoming a physician. Having left Germany in 1933 for France, he secretly worked with the [[French Resistance]] in the [[Second World War]]. After the war, Klein again left for India to study [[Yoga]] and Advaita Vedanta for three years. During those three years he met a spiritual teacher of Advaita, Pandit Veeraraghavachar Rao, a scholar at the Sanskrit College in Bangalore, and returned to the West to become a spiritual teacher himself. He died in 1998 in [[Santa Barbara, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Quinn: ''Critical Companion to George Orwell: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work.''

[[File:Electric hanukkah menora van.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Local [[Chabad house]] drives around [[Paris]] to get Jewish people interested in [[Hanukka]] services]]

'''Jewish outreach''' is a term sometimes used to translate the [[Hebrew]] word '''''kiruv''''' or '''''keruv''''' (literally, "to draw close" or "in-reach"). Normative [[Judaism]] does not actively seek [[Conversion to Judaism|converts]], although all denominations do accept those with a sincere commitment. Outreach efforts are instead directed at [[Jews]] who have "gone astray", or who have been born Jewish in a non-observant family.&lt;ref name="eJewish Philanthropy"&gt;{{cite web | title=Jewish Outreach, an Unorthodox Approach | website=eJewish Philanthropy | url=http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/jewish-outreach-an-unorthodox-approach/ | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and contemporary views==
The idea of "Jewish outreach" has mixed support among [[Jews]]; some are against the concept, while others share a vision of a more accessible and inclusive Jewish community.&lt;ref name="Jewish Outreach Institute"&gt;{{cite web | title=Jewish Federation of Greater St. Paul | website=Jewish Outreach Institute | url=https://jewishstpaul.org/community-directory/jewish-outreach-institute | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a country with a large [[Secular Jewish]] population and a 50% intermarriage rate, some Jewish federations and educational organizations provide an extensive range of offerings to the intermarried, to those who are marginally engaged with Jewish life, and to those who haven’t had any involvement in Judaism since attending Hebrew school or right after their [[bar mitzvah]].&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cohen | first=Debra Nussbaum | title=Jewish Outreach | website=My Jewish Learning | date=September 30, 2002 | url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Jewish_World_Today/Continuity/Outreach.shtml | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Chabad Lubavitch]]" was the first [[Orthodox Jewish]] organization in the United States to promote outreach means of recruiting  unobservant Jews who commit to living an observant lifestyle. 

[[Rabbi]] Dr. [[Shmuly Yanklowitz]] wrote that "outreach should enrich lives and society by making the [[Torah]]’s wisdom more broadly available. Further, outreach is not only about “one’s own” and we must bring people of different religions together in mutual understanding and respect by engaging in deep interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yanklowitz|first1=Shmuly|title=The Need for Empowering and Ethical Jewish Outreach|url=http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/the-need-for-empowering-and-ethical-jewish-outreach/|website=ejewishphilanthropy|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Levi Brackman]] said, "with the high rate of assimilation and intermarriage in the West, I cannot imagine that there could be too many outreach workers in the field. The day that happens will be a blessed one. The battle against assimilation is far too important for its warriors to get embroiled in politics of this sort. Undoubtedly, all the outreach organizations, Chabad included, should put their differences aside and pool together all their resources and ideas to create an even brighter Jewish tomorrow."&lt;ref name="Ynetnews"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Jewish outreach absurdity | website=Ynetnews | url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3501215,00.html | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kazimierz Jerzy Skrzypna-Twardowski''' (20 October 1866 – 11 February 1938) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]], [[logician]], and rector of the [[Lviv University]].

==Life==
Twardowski's family belonged to the [[Ogończyk coat of arms]].

Twardowski studied philosophy in [[Vienna]] with [[Franz Brentano]] and [[Robert von Zimmermann|Robert Zimmermann]]. In 1892 he received his [[doctorate]] with his dissertation, ''Idee und Perzeption'' (Idea and Perception), and in 1894 he presented his [[habilitation]] thesis, ''Zur Lehre vom Inhalt und Gegenstand der Vorstellungen'' (On the Doctrine of the Content and Object of Presentations). He originated many novel ideas related to [[metaphilosophy]].

He lectured in Vienna in the years 1894–95, then was appointed professor at Lwów ([[Lemberg]] in Austrian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], now [[Lviv]] in the [[Ukraine]]). An outstanding lecturer, he was also a rector of the Lwów University during  World War I.

There Twardowski established the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]] and also became the "father of Polish logic", beginning the tradition of scientific philosophy in Poland. Among his students were the logicians [[Stanisław Leśniewski]], [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] and [[Tadeusz Czeżowski]], the historian of [[philosophy]] [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetician]] [[Roman Ingarden]], as well as philosophers close to the [[Vienna Circle]] such as [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] and [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]].

==Work==
In his ''[[On the Content and Object of Presentations]]'', Twardowski argues for a distinction between content and object in the frame of the theory of intentionality of his teacher [[Franz Brentano]]. According to him the mind is divided in two main areas: ''acts'' or ''mental phenomena'', and a ''physical phenomenon''. For example, an act of presentation is aimed at a presentation. This is what he called ‘intentionality’, aboutness. Every act is about something, but also every presentation goes together with an act of presentation.

This theory suffers from the problem that it is not clear what the presentation exactly is. Is the presentation something only in the mind, or is it also in the world as object? Twardowski says that sometimes presentation is used for the object in the world and sometimes for the immanent content of a mental phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Twardowski (1894), Kazimierz, ''Zur Lehre vom Inhalt und Gegenstand der Vorstellungen – Eine psychologische Untersuchung'', Vienna: Philosophia Verlag, 1982, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Twardowski offers a solution for this problem and proposes to make a distinction between the content of a presentation and the object of a presentation.

In his book Twardowski offers an analogy to clarify this distinction. He uses the example of a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Twardowski (1894), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; People say of a landscape that it is painted, but also of a painting that it is painted. In the first case the word ‘painting’ is used in a modifying way (a painted landscape is not a landscape at all), while in the latter case the word painting is used in a qualitative or attributive way. Twardowski argues that presentations are similar. The content is the painted painting and the object is the painted landscape. The content resembles the present ‘picture’ in one's mind, and the object the landscape.

'''Liberty''' is a loose term in English for the goddess or personification of the concept of [[liberty]], and is represented by the [[Roman Goddess]] [[Libertas]], by [[Marianne]], the national symbol of France, and by many others. 

The Statue of Liberty (''Liberty Enlightening the World'') by [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]] is a well-known example in art, a gift from France to the United States.

==Classical examples==
{{main|Libertas}}
[[Image:RSC 0004a.6.jpg|thumb|300px|right| [[Denarius]] (42 BCE) issued by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]] and [[Lentulus Spinther]], depicting the crowned head of [[Libertas]], with a sacrificial jug and [[Lituus]] on the reverse]]
The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[goddess]] [[Libertas]] was honored during the [[second Punic War]] by a temple erected on the [[Aventine Hill]] in [[Rome]] by the father of [[Tiberius Gracchus]]. A statue in her honor also was raised by [[Clodius]] on the site of [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]]'s house after it had been razed. The figure bears certain resemblances to [[Sol Invictus]], the late Roman Republic sun deity and the crown often associated with that deity often appears in modern depictions of Liberty.

In the United States, "Liberty" often is depicted with five-pointed stars, as appear on the American flag, usually held in a raised hand. Another hand may hold a [[sword]] pointing downward. Depictions familiar to Americans include the following:
* The [[Statue of Liberty]] (''Liberty Enlightening the World''), its [[Replicas of the Statue of Liberty|replicas]], and its portrayal on many U.S. [[postage stamp]]s.
* Many denominations of American coins have depicted Liberty in both [[United States Barber coinage|bust side-view]] and [[Walking Liberty Half Dollar|full-figure designs]]; see also [[Liberty dollar (disambiguation)|Liberty dollar]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, [[Seated Liberty dollar]], [[Mercury dime|Liberty dime]], [[Indian Head cent]], and others. 
* The [[flag of the State of New York|flags of the States of New York]] and [[Flag of New Jersey|New Jersey]] (along with various signs and government-owned items bearing the [[Seal of New Jersey]])
* On the [[United States Capitol dome|dome of the U.S. Capitol]] as [[Statue of Freedom|Freedom]]
* On the dome of the [[Georgia State Capitol]] as [[Miss Freedom]]
* On the dome of the [[Texas State Capitol]]
* On the dome of the [[Allen County Courthouse (Indiana)|Allen County Courthouse]] in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]'''
* On the dome of the [[Bergen County]] Courthouse in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fdu.edu/newspubs/magazine/01fa/hack.html |work= FDU Magazine |date= Fall 2001 |accessdate= 2008-11-04 |title= Places We Call Home: Hackensack, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On both [[Demand Note|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America dollar|Confederate]] currency

In the early decades of the 20th Century, Liberty mostly displaced [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], who was widely used as the [[National personification]] of the US during the 19th Century.

The '''María Clara doctrine''', also known as the '''Woman's Honor doctrine''', is a [[legal doctrine]] applied by Philippine courts regarding cases that concerns [[Discrimination against women|abuse against women]].

==Etymology==
The doctrine was named after [[María Clara]] from [[José Rizal]]'s novel ''[[Noli Me Tángere (novel)|Noli Me Tángere]]''. Clara is characterized as reserved and shy and was later considered an "ideal" role model for women in Philippine culture.&lt;ref name="notabandoned"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patag|first1=Kristine Joy|title='SC has not abandoned ruling on Maria Clara doctrine'|url=http://old.philstar.com/headlines/2018/02/21/1789994/sc-has-not-abandoned-ruling-maria-clara-doctrine|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=The Philippine Star|date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal history==
The doctrine became a part of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]' [[jurisprudence]] sometime in 1960 following the ''People v. Taño'' case. The high court through Justice Alejo Labrador has asserted a "well known fact" that women, especially Filipinos "would not admit that they have been abused unless that abuse had actually happened."&lt;ref name="notabandoned"/&gt; The court said that women's natural instict is to protect their honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cawilan|first1=Christopher Lloyd|title=SC acquits 2 men of rape charges|agency=Philippine News Agency|url=http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1025868|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The case involved three armed robbers who the court found liable for [[gang rape|taking turns in raping]] a woman.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite news|last1=San Juan|first1=Joel|title=SC sets aside ‘woman’s honor’ doctrine in resolving rape cases|url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/sc-sets-aside-womans-honor-doctrine-in-resolving-rape-cases/|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=Business Mirror|date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 58 years later since the doctrine entered the high court's jurisprudence, the Third Division of the Supreme Court reverse a ruling on January 17, 2018 by a Davao court on two people convicted of rape.&lt;ref name="notabandoned"/&gt; The 2018 decision was released in late-February.&lt;ref name="ms"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Requejo|first1=Rey|title=High court drops 1960 doctrine in rape case|url=http://manilastandard.net/news/top-stories/259208/high-court-drops-1960-doctrine-in-rape-case.html|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=Manila Standard|date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case involves an alleged rape that happened in 2009 and the two accused were sentenced of ''[[reclusión perpetua]]'', or forty years of imprisonment, in 2012. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in 2016.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Panaligan|first1=Rey|title=High Court abandons ‘woman’s honor’ doctrine in rape cases|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/02/20/high-court-abandons-womans-honor-doctrine-in-rape-cases/|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=Manila Bulletin|date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court described the doctrine as causing a "travesty of justice" by putting the accused at an "unfair disadvantage"&lt;ref name="notabandoned"/&gt;, criticizing the doctrine for assuming that no Filipina woman of "decent repute" would falsely claim that she was abused. It urged for the acceptance of the "realities of a woman’s dynamic role" in Philippine society today so one can "evaluate the testimony of a private complainant of rape without [[gender bias]] or cultural misconception". It also stated that the discrepancies in the alleged victim's testimonies had cast doubt on whether the rape incident did or did not happen.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;

This has led to concerns and speculations that the high court has abandoned the doctrine.&lt;ref name="notabandoned"/&gt; The [[Gabriela Women's Party]] condemned the decision which it viewed made the Maria Clara doctrine invalid saying the ruling reversal will empower rapists and disagreed with the court's assessment of the societal status of women.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

On February 21, 2018, Supreme Court's spokesperson, Theodore Te has clarified that it was not the case since the high court can abandon a doctrine only during a full session.&lt;ref name="notabandoned"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10043">'''María Goyri de Menéndez Pidal''' (1873&amp;ndash;1955) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Hispanic|Hispanist]], literary critic, researcher, educator and advocate for women's rights. In 1896 she became the first [[Spain|Spanish]] woman to earn a degree in [[Philosophy]] and [[Literature|Letters]] and the first to earn her doctorate, in 1909, at a [[Spain|Spanish]] university (the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]]). She was the wife of [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]]. [[File:Mz Pidal y María Goyri.jpg|thumb | 200px | Ramón Menéndez Pidal and María Goyri in 1900. Newlyweds on the route of El Cid. Archivo Digital Menéndez Pidal.]]

==Life==
Born in [[Madrid]] to a [[Basque people|Basque]] family, she spent her early years in [[Algorta]], a seaside village in the province of [[Biscay]]. She returned to Madrid with her mother, Amalia Goyri, a seamstress of great character and culture. Due to her delicate health she was educated at home by her mother who frequently gave her lessons outdoors in the [[Buen Retiro Park]] to help combat her tubercular arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;''La primera mujer universitaria Española: María Goyri'' http://www.mujeryciencia.es/2010/10/25/la-primera-mujer-universitaria-espanola-maria-goyri/print/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the conventions of the time she enrolled María in a gym and when she was twelve she began business courses at the Association for the Education of Women. There she discovered she enjoyed the study of grammar and in 1887 she enrolled in the School for Governesses to become a teacher. In 1890 she and another young student, Carmen Gallardo, audited classes in the School of [[Philosophy]] and [[Literature|Letters]] at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]]. In 1892 she received permission from the General Secretary of Public Instruction to register officially as a female student in order to attend classes on the condition that her presence not distract male students.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Pérez &amp; Maureen Ihrie, ''The Feminist Encyclopedia of Spanish Literature'', (2002) https://books.google.com/books?id=thba9JxuDXAC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=maria+goyri&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KDhrQyDwH&amp;sig=gIgomgFHbqasXyLaY491k9zh0QQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tID9TNfDHIessApg4o3QBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=OCDsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=maria%20goyri&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to each class she was not permitted to wait in the corridor and had to wait in an office adjacent to her classroom. Her professor would then escort her to her own individual desk near his. At the end of class she would be escorted out the same way. One of her professors was the foremost academic of the day, the [[Spain|Spanish]] scholar and historian, [[Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo]]. In her first year she heard [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]]'s presentation of "The Education of Men &amp; Women" in which she attacked [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rosseau]] and [[François Fénelon]] as anti-feminist and defended [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] for their progressive advocacy of educational reforms for women. When [[Concepción Arenal]]'s presentation of her views on women's duties and rights provoked violent attacks, María stood up and vehemently defended the elderly activist. María Goyri obtained the titles of normal school [[professor]] (1893), [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in philosophy and letters (1896), and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and letters (1909).

==Marriage==
María met [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]] when [[Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo|Menéndez Pelayo]] took her to hear his former student give a lecture at the Graduate School of the University. Ramón was now a university professor and had obtained the chair in Romance [[Philology]]. Finding they shared the same interests she became his student and then his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.segundarepublica.com/index.php?opcion=2&amp;id=48&lt;/ref&gt; They were married in 1900 and for their honeymoon they retraced the geographic locales of the ''Poem of the Cid'' ([[Cantar de Mio Cid|Poema de mío Cid]]), the oldest preserved Spanish [[Epic poetry|epic poem]].&lt;ref&gt;Penguin Classics, ''The Poem of the Cid: A Bilingual Edition with Parallel Text'', Translated by Rita Hamilton, (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

They had three children: Ramón, who died in childhood, [[Jimena Menéndez Pidal|Jimena]] and Gonzalo.

María and Ramón devoted their lives to research on everything related to [[philology]] and the preservation of ancient [[Spain|Spanish]] history and [[ballads]]. She also collaborated with the ''Protectorado del Niño Delincuente'' (Child Delinquent Protectorate), an organization founded in 1916 to help prevent the incarceration of youths under the age of 16. When the ''Instituto Escuela de segunda enseñanza'' (High School Institute) was established in 1918 she taught language and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Pérez &amp; Maureen Ihrie, ''The Feminist Encyclopedia of Spanish Literature'', (2002), p.280&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, 1933 she was elected board member of the ''Patronato del Centro para Ampliación de Estudios'' (Board for Advanced Studies) and worked along with [[Blas Cabrera Felipe|Blas Cabrera]], [[Luis Calandre]], [[María de Maeztu]] and [[Luis de Zulueta]]. She taught at the Institute of Free Education (Junta para Ampliación de Estudios) until the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] combining physical exercise along with intellectual studies.

==Spanish Civil War==
María and Ramón were at their country house at San Rafael, a town nestled on the royal road linking [[Madrid]] to the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso]], when the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil war]] broke out taking them completely by surprise. They were with their daughter [[Jimena Menéndez Pidal|Jimena]], her husband, [[Miguel Catalán Sañudo]] and their son [[Diego Catalán]] in an area controlled by military who had risen against the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. After bombardment by planes from the [[Cuatro Vientos Airport]] they were forced to flee to [[El Espinar]] and later to [[Segovia]] for safety. The war was a catastrophe for Goyri. They were on the side of [[Francisco Franco]] but she still defended her liberal views including equal rights for women in all areas, especially education. In the ''Archivo General de la Guerra Civil Española'' (General Archive of the Spanish Civil War) is a report that was made up by the National Defense Council led by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. It reveals that the family members of Menéndez Pidal-Catalán and their circle of friends were being discreetly watched and their correspondence checked. The report sent to [[Burgos]], the base of the [[Francoist Spain|Nationalist government]], said that ''"[[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]], Director of the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]], was weak of character and totally dominated by his wife, María Goyri, a cultured woman of great talent and extraordinary energy who has perverted her husband and children. She is very persuasive and one of the most dangerous people in Spain. Without doubt one of the more robust roots of the revolution."''

After the war the Free Institute of Education and all schools under the auspices of the Board for Advanced Studies were banned and teachers forbidden to promote women's equality in education and other liberal causes. In addition to teaching María devoted her later years to research, gathering and archiving different versions of ancient oral ballads that are now kept in the ''Fundación Ramón Menéndez Pidal'', a non-profit center dedicated to developing historical and philogical studies and humanistic research.&lt;ref&gt;Fundación Ramón Menéndez Pidal {{cite web |url=http://olivarchamartin.blogia.com/2006/120901-la-fundacion-ramon-menendez-pidal-hoy.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708015706/http://olivarchamartin.blogia.com/2006/120901-la-fundacion-ramon-menendez-pidal-hoy.php |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Located at the olive grove garden of ''Olivar de Chamartin'' in the north of Madrid it is an indispensable source for scholars and is today considered part of the "National Treasure" of Spain.

Her niece was the writer and activist [[María Teresa León]] (daughter of her sister Oliva) and her grandson was the [[Spain|Spanish]] philologist [[Diego Catalán]] who presided over the "Fundación Ramón Menéndez Pidal". There are streets in [[Alicante]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Granada]] and [[Guadalajara]] named after her (''Calle María Goyri'').

'''Max Hartmann''' (June 7, 1876 - October 11, 1962) was a German biologist, alluded to In Phylogenetic Systematics by [[Willi Hennig]] for his investigations into divisions of sciences, most notably into descriptive and explanatory. He was philosopher of science and author of Allgemaine Biology. 

The publicly available abstract of an article in Nature Magazine (1946) presents him as a student of the sexuality and fertilization in Protozoa and Algae; that "he can look back upon a fine record of original research...His investigations of ‘relative sexuality’ [which] have led to very important biochemical studies of the substances produced and released by gametes and essential for fertilization in Algae, echinoderms, molluscs and fishes"; and that he was an outspoken critic of Nazism. Hartmann was director of the "Kaiser Wilhelm Institut für Biologie".

'''Michel Bitbol''' (born March 12, 1954) is a French researcher in [[philosophy of science]].

He is "Directeur de recherche" at [[CNRS]], previously in the Centre de Recherche en Epistémologie Appliquée (CREA) of École polytechnique (Paris, France).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automates Intelligents|url=http://www.automatesintelligents.com/interviews/2004/juil/bitbol.html|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now a member of Archives Husserl, Ecole Normale Superieure (Paris, France).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives Husserl|url=http://129.199.13.46/spip.php?rubrique142|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career==
His research interests are mainly focused on the influence of [[quantum physics]] on [[philosophy]]. He first worked on [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s metaphysics and philosophy of physics.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schrödinger, The interpretation of quantum mechanics (Dublin seminars 1949-1955), edited and with an introduction by M. Bitbol, Ox Bow Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Using theorems demonstrated by [[Jean-Louis Destouches]], [[Paulette Destouches-Février]], and [[R.I.G. Hughes]], he pointed out that the structure of quantum mechanics may be derived to a large extent from the assumption that microscopic phenomena cannot be dissociated from their experimental context.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bitbol, "La mécanique quantique comme théorie des probabilités généralisée", in: E. Klein &amp; Y. Sacquin (eds.), Prévision et probabilités dans les sciences, Editions Frontières, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; His views on quantum mechanics converge with ideas developed by [[Julian Schwinger]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Schwinger, Quantum Mechanics. Symbolism of Atomic Measurements, Springer, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Asher Peres]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Peres, Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods, Kluwer, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; according to whom [[quantum mechanics]] is a "symbolism of atomic measurements", rather than a description of atomic objects. He also defends ideas close to [[Anton Zeilinger]]'s, by claiming that quantum laws do not express the nature of physical objects, but only the bounds of experimental information.

Along with this view, [[quantum mechanics]] is no longer considered as a physical theory in the ordinary sense, but rather as a background framework for physical theories, since it goes back to the most elementary conditions which allow us to formulate any physical theory whatsoever. Some reviewers suggested half-seriously to call this view of physics "Kantum physics". Indeed, Michel Bitbol often refers to the philosophy of I. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], according to whom one can understand the contents of knowledge only by analyzing the (sensorial, instrumental, and rational) conditions of possibility of such knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00002096/ M. Bitbol, “Some steps towards a transcendental deduction of quantum mechanics”, Philosophia naturalis, 35, 253-280, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was granted an award by the  French "Académie des sciences morales et politiques" in 1997, for his work in the philosophy of quantum mechanics.

Later on, he concentrated on the philosophy of mind and consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00004007/ M. Bitbol, “Is Consciousness Primary ?”, NeuroQuantology, 6, 53-71, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; defending a strongly anti-reductionist&lt;ref&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00004006/ M. Bitbol, “Ontology, matter and emergence”, Phenomenology and the Cognitive Science, 6, 293-307, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and neo-Wittgensteinian view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000889/ M. Bitbol, “Science as if situation mattered”, Phenomenology and the Cognitive Science, 1, 181-224, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated with [[Francisco Varela]] on this subject.

He participated in the 2002/2013 conferences of the [[Mind and Life Institute]], whose aim is to promote a dialogue between [[science]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;P.L. Luisi (ed.), Mind &amp; Life, Discussions with the Dalai-Lama on the Nature of Reality, Columbia University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently wrote a book developing a thoroughly relational reading of quantum mechanics, with due reference to the Buddhist concept of dependent arising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actu Philosophia|url=http://actu-philosophia.com/spip.php?article282|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non Fiction|url=http://www.nonfiction.fr/articleprint-3400-kant_nouveau_sage_tibetain_de_la_physique_quantique_.htm|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mohsen ghanebasiri.jpg|thumb|Mohsen Ghanebasiri, Iranian Theorist]]

'''Mohsen Ghanebasiri''' (24 October 1949 - 18 May 2017) was born in [[Tehran]] was an [[epistemologist]], [[chemist]], [[author]] and [[theorist]] on [[economy]], [[culture]], [[arts]] ([[cybernetics]]) and [[management]]. He had been the editor-in-chief of Modiriat (Management) monthly journal for years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranmanagement.org/FA/Default.aspx?PageID=183 Mohsen Ghanebasiri the editor-in-chief of Modiriat Monthly Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;. He published more than 200 papers and 10 books. He was without a doubt one of the greatest Persian intellectuals in their history as well as influencing the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghanebasiri.ir/fa/home/ Mohsen Ghanebasiri's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Mohsen Ghanebasiri was born 24 Oct. 1949 in Tehran the capital city of Iran. He studied in Naserkhosrow Primary School, and [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar ul-Funun]] and Elmieh High Schools his secondary education. He graduated from [[Tehran University]] in [[chemistry]]. Afterward, he moved to [[the United States]] to continue his education as a chemist in [[Georgia University]]. He returned to [[Iran]] in 1979 and started working and writing on the managerial domains and started researching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daneshgostar.co/ Danesh Gostar Encyclopedia], Danesh Gostar Scientific-cultural Institute, 2010, Volume 12, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; 
While studying chemistry in the U.S. in the 70s, he did not confine himself to his field of study and read voraciously which made him a man of thought. He was interested in the issues related to the development as a student and did not consider it separate from the cultural domain. As a matter of fact, he believes in the kind of theorizing which, while recognizing human being, technology and culture as separate, considers them united in a domain and does not consider them independent from each other. Moreover, he holds that the key to success and reaching the ideal in this world is recognition firstly, and its scientific and appropriate management secondly.

==Publications==
Ghanebasiri founded Kimia Monthly Journal, the first professional petrochemical journal in Iran, after the [[Islamic Revolution]]. Despite being very professional, Kimia established itself very soon among its readers. Ghanebasiri published “From Information to Knowledge” two years after Kimia was closed down. This book is about the “Tripartite Equations Theory” and the relation between [physical] [[mass]], [[energy]] and [[information]]. 
The most important theory of this book revolves around the theory of the inverse proportionality of the mass, energy and information ratio as well as the hypothesis that there is an inverse proportionality between knowledge and awareness and the consumption of mass and energy by the systems. 
Ghanebasiri has also published more than 500 articles in different journals, namely, Iran, Gozaresh (Report), San’ate Lastik (Rubber Industry), San’ate Pelastik (Plastic Industry), Amniate Melli (National Security) and Kimia. He was also the editor-in-chief of Modiriat (Management) Monthly Journal and Aryana Gardeshgar (Aryana Tourist) Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rasekhoon.net/article/Show-36239.aspx Mohsen Ghanebasiri the editor-in-chief of Aryana Gardeshgar Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;  which was published under the title of Saegheh (Thunderbolt) up to its 13th issue.

== Theories==

Ghanebasiri has provided his Tripartite Equations Theory &lt;ref&gt;[http://daneshgostar.co/ Danesh Gostar Encyclopedia], Danesh Gostar Scientific-cultural Institute, 2010, Volume 12, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; based on two other principles theories: 1st. the inverse proportionality between awareness, mass, and energy 2nd. the Awareness Ratio Principle according to which the amount of the information given to the system permanently causes a decrease in awareness of the system and then leads to the quality drop in all the systems. This issue is defined in social domains, epistemological domains as well as the domains related to technology and culture. His theory was a breakthrough in epistemology as well as in cybernetics, society, and technology.

The establishment of the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga was based on a Government of India initiative to revive the yoga culture and spread the yoga philosophy to all parts of the country. The functioning of the Institute is under the Department of Ayush,&lt;ref name="Ayush"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indianmedicine.nic.in/index3.asp?sslid=197&amp;subsublinkid=83&amp;lang=1 | title=Ayush | publisher=Department of Ayush, under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India | work=Web site | date=2010 | accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India. The Institute is mandated to promote Yoga philosophy and facilitate training and advanced research on the subject.&lt;ref name="Courses"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yoga.info/en/yoga-place/india/new-delhi/morarji-desai-national-institute-of-yoga | title=Courses | publisher=Yoga.info | date=2014 | accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was started in 1970, in the form a hospital, opened by the now defunct ''Central Council for Research in Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy'', under the ''Vishwayatan Yogashram''. The hospital was later converted into an institute, by name, ''Central Research Institute for Yoga'' (CRIY) in 1976, to provide free training to people and to organize research on yoga. In 1988, the institute was further renamed as the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga with expanded mandates.&lt;ref name="Ayush" /&gt;

==Facilities==
The Institute is housed in a campus measuring 2.818 acres, and is equipped with the amenities such as a conference hall with audio visual facilities accommodating 50 people, an auditorium with a capacity of 140 people, a library with a collection of over 9000 books on yoga and related topics, a practice hall (Kriya block) for 30 people, an academic block for classes and practices, an out-patient facility where therapists, dieticians and medical officers offer consultancy services, a laboratory with physiological and biochemical testing and research facilities, an x-ray unit and a multi media centre with audio-visual support.

==Departments==
'''Teaching Department''': The faculty of MDNIY is further classified into eight sub sections, each catering to a specific branch of study such as Yoga Education, Yoga [[Therapy]], Yoga Philosophy, Yoga and Human Consciousness, [[Anatomy]], [[Physiology]], Allied Sciences and Languages. The department of Allied sciences focusses on alternative medicine systems such as [[Ayurveda]] and [[Naturopathy]] as well as clinical

'''Muriel Téodori''' (born September 8, 1958) is a French psychoanalyst, writer, film maker and film producer.

==Career==
Muriel Téodori graduated with degrees in philosophy and clinical psychopathology and went on to teach philosophy.&lt;ref name=enc /&gt;

Developing an interest in film, Téodori collaborated on several screenplays for feature films, including ''Tom and Lola'', ''The Shadow and The Silences of the Palace'', and directed several short films. The first feature film she directed was ''Sans plomb'' in 2000, which premiered at the [[Cabourg Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2000/06/25/97860-sans-plomb-bat-gladiator.html|title="Sans plomb" bat "Gladiator"|date=25 June 2000|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although well received by critics, it was not a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2000/09/02/94605-sans-plomb-le-flop-de-l-ete.html|title=La réalisatrice estime que son film " a été assassiné "|date=2 September 2000|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harmonyoftheworld.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&lt;center&gt;Harmony of the world, 1806&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Musica universalis''' (literally '''universal music'''), also called '''Music of the spheres''' or '''Harmony of the Spheres''', is an ancient [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept that regards proportions in the movements of [[celestial bodies]]—the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s—as a form of ''musica'' (the [[Medieval]] [[Latin]] term for [[music]]). This "music" is not usually thought to be literally audible, but a [[harmonic]], [[mathematics|mathematical]] or [[religious]] concept.  The idea continued to appeal to thinkers about music until the end of the [[Renaissance]], influencing scholars of many kinds, including [[humanism|humanists]].  Further scientific exploration has determined specific proportions in some orbital motion, described as [[orbital resonance]].

== History ==
[[File:The music of the spheres.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Engraving from Renaissance Italy (Gafurius's ''Practica musice'', 1496) showing Apollo, the Muses, the planetary spheres and musical modes]]
{{See also|Pythagoreanism#Music and harmony}}

The discovery of the precise relation between the pitch of the musical note and the length of the string that produces it is attributed to Pythagoras.
The Music of the Spheres incorporates the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or "tones" of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion. [[Pythagoras]]  first identified that the [[Pitch (music)|pitch of a musical note]] is in inverse proportion to the length of the string that produces it, and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Weiss-2008|Weiss and Taruskin (2008)]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=q1eobgND8H4C&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;  In a theory known as the Harmony of the Spheres, Pythagoras proposed that the Sun, Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based on their orbital revolution,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Pliny-77|Pliny the Elder (77)]] pp. 277–8, (II.xviii.xx): "…occasionally Pythagoras draws on the theory of music, and designates the distance between the Earth and the Moon as a whole tone, that between the Moon and Mercury as a semitone, .... the seven tones thus producing the so-called diapason, ''i.e.''. a universal harmony".&lt;/ref&gt; and that the quality of life on Earth reflects the tenor of celestial sounds which are physically imperceptible to the human ear.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-2000|Houlding (2000)]] p. 28: 

For [[Philolaus]], mathematician and Pythagorean astronomer, working around 400 BC, the world was 'harmony and numbers'; everything is ordered according to proportions that correspond to three basic musical intervals: 2:1 (harmony), 3:2 (fifth), 4:3 (fourth). Nicomachus of Gerasa (also a Pythagorean, towards the year 200 BC) assigns the notes of the octave to the celestial bodies, so that they generate a music.
"The doctrine of the Pythagoreans was a combination of science and mysticism… Like Anaximenes they viewed the Universe as one integrated, living organism, surrounded by Divine Air (or more literally 'Breath'), which permeates and animates the whole cosmos and filters through to individual creatures … By partaking of the core essence of the Universe, the individual is said to act as a microcosm in which all the laws in the macrocosm of the Universe are at work".&lt;/ref&gt;   Subsequently, Plato described astronomy and music as "twinned" studies of sensual recognition: astronomy for the eyes, music for the ears, and both requiring knowledge of numerical proportions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Davis-1901|Davis (1901)]] p. 252. Plato's ''Republic'' VII.XII reads: "As the eyes, said I, seem formed for studying astronomy, so do the ears seem formed for harmonious motions: and these seem to be twin sciences to one another, as also the Pythagoreans say".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] criticised the notion&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, On the Heavens, J.L. Stocks' translation, http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.2.ii.html&lt;/ref&gt; that celestial bodies make a sound in moving in the context of his own cosmological model. &lt;blockquote&gt;From all this it is clear that the theory that the movement of the stars produces a harmony, i.e. that the sounds they make are concordant, in spite of the grace and originality with which it has been stated, is nevertheless untrue. Some thinkers suppose that the motion of bodies of that size must produce a noise, since on our earth the motion of bodies far inferior in size and in speed of movement has that effect. Also, when the sun and the moon, they say, and all the stars, so great in number and in size, are moving with so rapid a motion, how should they not produce a sound immensely great? Starting from this argument and from the observation that their speeds, as measured by their distances, are in the same ratios as musical concordances, they assert that the sound given forth by the circular movement of the stars is a harmony. Since, however, it appears unaccountable that we should not hear this music, they explain this by saying that the sound is in our ears from the very moment of birth and is thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence, since sound and silence are discriminated by mutual contrast. What happens to men, then, is just what happens to coppersmiths, who are so accustomed to the noise of the smithy that it makes no difference to them. But, as we said before, melodious and poetical as the theory is, it cannot be a true account of the facts. There is not only the absurdity of our hearing nothing, the ground of which they try to remove, but also the fact that no effect other than sensitive is produced upon us. Excessive noises, we know, shatter the solid bodies even of inanimate things: the noise of thunder, for instance, splits rocks and the strongest of bodies. But if the moving bodies are so great, and the sound which penetrates to us is proportionate to their size, that sound must needs reach us in an intensity many times that of thunder, and the force of its action must be immense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The three branches of the Medieval concept of musica were presented by [[Boethius]] in his book ''De Musica'':&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, De institutione musica, I.2 (p. 187 Friedlein ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''musica mundana'' (sometimes referred to as ''musica universalis'')
* ''musica humana'' (the internal music of the human body)
* ''musica quae in quibusdam constituta est instrumentis'' (sounds made by singers and instrumentalists)

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings, the heavenly "music of the spheres" is heard in the ''Region of Concrete Thought'', the lower region of the [[mental plane]], which is an ocean of harmony.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

M''usica universalis'', which had existed since the Greeks, as a metaphysical concept was often taught in [[quadrivium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voelkel|first=J. R.|date=1994|title=The music of the heavens: Kepler's harmonic astronomy|url=|journal=Physics Today|volume=48(6)|pages=59-60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this connection between music and astronomy intrigued Johannes Kepler, and he devoted much of his time after publishing the [[Mysterium Cosmographicum|''Mysterium'' ''Cosmographicum'']] (Mystery of the Cosmos) looking over tables and trying to fit the data to what he believed to be the true nature of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mysterium Cosmographicum|last=Kepler|first=Johannes|year=1596|location=Tubingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28293391|title=Kepler|last=1880-1956.|first=Caspar, Max,|date=1993|publisher=Dover Publications|others=Hellman, Clarisse Doris, 1910-1973.|isbn=0486676056|location=New York|oclc=28293391}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1619 Kepler published ''Harmonices Mundi'' (literally Harmony of the Worlds), expanding on the concepts he introduced in ''Mysterium'' and positing that [[Interval (music)|musical intervals]] and [[Harmony|harmonies]] describe the motions of the six known planets of the time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36826094|title=The harmony of the world|last=1571-1630.|first=Kepler, Johannes,|date=1997|publisher=American Philosophical Society|others=Aiton, E. J., Duncan, A. M. (Alistair Matheson), Field, Judith Veronica.|isbn=0871692090|location=[Philadelphia, Pa.]|oclc=36826094}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that this harmony, while inaudible, could be heard by the soul, and that it gave a “very agreeable feeling of bliss, afforded him by this music in the imitation of God.” In ''Harmonices'', Kepler laid out an argument for a creator who had made an explicit connection between geometry, astronomy, and music, and that the planets were arranged in intelligently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Planetary_Musical_Scales_from_Harmony_of_the_Worlds.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Planetary_Musical_Scales_from_Harmony_of_the_Worlds.jpg|thumb|359x359px|Page from Kepler's ''Harmonices Mundi''. The scales of each of the six known planets, and the moon, placed on five-line staffs.]]
''Harmonices'' is split into five books, or chapters. The first and second books give a brief discussion on [[regular polyhedron]] and their [[Congruence (geometry)|congruences]], reiterating the idea he introduced in ''Mysterium'' that the five regular solids known about since antiquity define the orbits of the planets and their distances from the sun. Book three focuses on defining musical harmonies, including [[consonance and dissonance]], intervals (including the problems of just tuning), their relations to string length, and what makes music pleasurable to listen to. In the fourth book Kepler presents a metaphysical basis for this system, along with arguments for why the harmony of the worlds appeals to the intellectual soul in the same manner as the harmony of music appeals to the human soul. Here he also uses the naturalness of this harmony as an argument for [[heliocentrism]]. In book five, Kepler describes in detail the orbital motion of the planets and how this motion nearly perfectly matches musical harmonies. Finally, after a discussion on [[astrology]] in book five, Kepler ends ''Harmonices'' by describing his [[Third law of planetary motion|third law]], which states that for any planet the cube of the semi-major axis of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the square of its orbital period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the final book of ''Harmonices'', Kepler explains how the ratio of the maximum and minimum [[Angular velocity|angular speeds]] of each planet (its speeds at the perihelion and aphelion) is very nearly equivalent to a consonant musical interval. Furthermore, the ratios between these extreme speeds of the planets compared against each other create even more mathematical harmonies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These speeds explain the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the orbits of the planets in a natural way that appealed to Kepler’s religious beliefs in a heavenly creator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While Kepler did believe that the harmony of the worlds was inaudible, he related the motions of the planets to musical concepts in book four of ''Harmonices''. He makes an analogy between comparing the extreme speeds of one planet and the extreme speeds of multiple planets with the difference between [[Monophonic music|monophonic]] and [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] music. Because planets with larger eccentricities have a greater variation in speed they produce more “notes.” Earth’s maximum and minimum speeds, for example, are in a ratio of roughly 16 to 15, or that of a semitone, whereas Venus’ orbit is nearly circular, and therefore only produces a singular note. Mars, which has the largest eccentricity, has the largest interval, a minor tenth, or a ratio of 12 to 5. This range, as well as the relative speeds between the planets, led Kepler to conclude that the solar system was comprised of two basses ([[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]]), a tenor ([[Mars]]), two altos ([[Venus]] and [[Earth]]), and a soprano ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), which had sung in “perfect concord,” at the beginning of time, and could potentially arrange themselves to do so again.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was certain of the link between musical harmonies and the harmonies of the heavens and believed that “man, the imitator of the Creator,” had emulated the polyphony of the heavens so as to enjoy “the continuous duration of the time of the world in a fraction of an hour.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kepler was so convinced in a creator that he was convinced of the existence of this harmony despite a number of inaccuracies present in ''Harmonices''. Many of the ratios differed by an error greater than simple measurement error from the true value for the interval, and the ratio between Mars’ and Jupiter’s angular velocities does not create a consonant interval, though every other combination of planets does. Kepler brushed aside this problem by making the argument, with the math to support it, that because these [[elliptical]] paths had to fit into the regular solids described in ''Mysterium'' the values for both the dimensions of the solids and the angular speeds would have to differ from the ideal values to compensate. This change also had the benefit of helping Kepler retroactively explain why the regular solids encompassing each planet were slightly imperfect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Use in recent music==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The connection between music, mathematics, and astronomy had a profound impact on history. It resulted in music's inclusion in the Quadrivium, the medieval curriculum that included arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy, and along with the Trivium (grammar, logic,and rhetoric) made up the seven liberal arts, which are still the basis for higher education today. A small number of recent compositions either make reference to or are based on the concepts of Musica Universalis or Harmony of the Spheres. Among these are ''[[Music of the Spheres (Mike Oldfield album)|Music of the Spheres]]'' by [[Mike Oldfield]], ''[[Om (The Moody Blues song)|Om]]'' by [[the Moody Blues]], ''[[The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi]]'' album by [[The Receiving End of Sirens]], ''[[Music of the Spheres (Ian Brown album)|Music of the Spheres]]'' by [[Ian Brown]]'','' and [[Björk]]'s single ''[[Cosmogony (song)|Cosmogony]]'', included in her 2011 album ''[[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]]''. Earlier, in the 1910s, Danish composer [[Rued Langgaard]] composed a pioneering orchestral work titled ''[[Music of the Spheres (Langgaard)|Music of the Spheres]]''. ''Music of the Spheres'' was also the title chosen for the musical foundation of the video-game [[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]], and was composed by Martin O'Donnell, Michael Salvatori, and Paul McCartney. [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote an Opera (1957), and a Symphony using the same music, called 'Die Harmonie der Welt' based upon the life of the Astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630).

[[File:Pontius und Sidona cpg142 122r.png|thumb|Pontus and his train disguised as [[wild man|wild men]] at the wedding of Sidonia and Genelet, illustration in a manuscript commissioned for Margarethe of Savoy  in ca. 1475 (Heidelberg, CPG 142, fol. 122r).]]

'''''Pontus and Sidonia''''' (French: '''''Ponthus et la belle Sidonie''''' or just ''Ponthus et Sidoine'') is a medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|prose romance]], originally composed in French in ca. 1400, possibly by [[Geoffroy IV de la Tour Landry]] (d. 1391) or by another member of the La Tour family. It is about Pontus, the son of the king of Galicia, who falls in love with Sidonia, daughter of the king of Brittany. The text is associated with the lords of La Tour because it derives the ancestors of that family, whose ancestral possessions were in Brittany, from members of the train of prince Pontus. The story is based on an earlier work, the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] [[chanson de geste]] ''[[Horn et Rimenhild]]'' (ca. 1180).

Several German translations were made during the 15th century (viz., in the period corresponding to the final phase of [[Middle High German]] or the formative phase of [[Early New High German]]). There is a surviving version in [[Alemannic German]], possibly written in the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], dated to between 1440 and 1460, and another version in [[Moselle Franconian]], probably written in the region of [[Trier]].  Another translation of the French text was made by [[Eleanor of Scotland|Eleanor, Archduchess of Austria]] (1433–1480).

A late medieval Dutch translation ''Die historie van Ponthus ende die schoone Sidonie'' survived in an edition printed by Niclaes vanden Wouwere in Antwerp in 1564.

A '''precising definition''' is a [[definition]] that extends the [[lexical definition]] of a term for a specific purpose by including additional criteria that narrow down the set of things meeting the definition.

For example, a dictionary may define the term "student" as "1. anyone attending an educational institution of any type, or 2. anyone who studies something." However, a movie theater may propose a ''precising definition'' for the word "student" of "any person under the age of 18 enrolled in a local school" in order to determine who is eligible to receive discounted tickets.

Precising definitions are generally used in contexts where [[vagueness]] is unacceptable; many [[law|legal]] definitions are precising definitions, as are company policies. This type of definition is useful in preventing disputes that arise from the involved parties using different definitions of the term in question.

A precising definition is intended to make a vague word more precise so that the word's meaning is not left to the interpretation of the reader or listener. Here is an example:

''From a class syllabus:'' "Class participation" means attending class, listening attentively, answering and asking questions, and participating in class discussions.

This is similar to a [[stipulative definition]], but differs in that a stipulative definition may contradict the lexical definition, while a precising definition does not.

'''Solomon Isaac Passy''' ({{lang-bg|Соломон Исак Паси}}) (born December 22, 1956) is a Bulgarian scientist, politician, and innovator, founder and President of the Atlantic Club of Bulgaria (since 1990), [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bulgaria)|Foreign Minister]] in the Government of Simeon Sakskoburggotski (2001-2005), Chairman-in-Office of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) in 2004. He represented Bulgaria at UN Security Council and was its Chairman (September 2002 and December 2003), and was nominated by Bulgaria for Secretary General of NATO (2009).

As Foreign Minister he negotiated and signed Bulgaria's accessions to NATO (2004) and EU (2005) - projects which he initiated as Member of Parliament back in 1990.

Passy served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Committees on Foreign Affairs (2005-2009) and Foreign Affairs, Defense and Security (2001). He was a Member of Parliament in three legislations (1990-1991, 2001-2005, 2005–2009) and the first CEE Vice-President of the [[Atlantic Treaty Association]] (ATA), Paris (1996-1999) and Chair of the Transparency and Accountability Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of OSCE (2006-2009).

In the 1980s Passy was active in anti-establishment and pro-democratic movements. He holds a [[Ph.D.]] in mathematical logic, entitling him to the honorific title Dr Passy, and was a computer scientist at Sofia University and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (1979-1994). Passy and his wife Gergana are co-authors of the EU Universal USB charger for GSM (2008-2014) and he is a pioneer of Bulgaria's Antarctic presence and membership in the Antarctic Treaty.

== Early life and education==
Solomon Passy was born in [[Plovdiv]]. He is the son of Bulgarian [[philosopher]] Prof. [[Isaac Passy]] and physician, inventor and endocrinologist Lily Passy. He is a [[mathematician]] and holds a Ph.D. (1985) in Mathematical Logic and Computer Science from [[Sofia University]]. In the 1980s he was involved in the dissident movements opposing the communist regime.

==Career and politics==
In 1990 Passy became the founding President and CEO of the [[Atlantic Club of Bulgaria]] (ACB), the only NGO operating within Warsaw Pact countries vocally advocating its dissolution, and the accession of New Europe to NATO and the EU. He also co-founded the [[Green Party of Bulgaria|Green Party]] serving as its spokesman (1989), the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (1989), the  Club for Support of Glasnost and Perestroika of [[Zhelyu Zhelev]] (1989), as well as the [[National Movement for Stability and Progress|National Movement Simeon II]] (2001).

===The Berlin Wall era===
In the 1980s Passy was an activist of various opposition, underground and ecological movements opposing communism, including in defense of the oppressed Turkish minority in Bulgaria; in solidarity with them he assumed the Turkish pseudonym Syuleyman Tehlikeli when publishing mathematical papers and graphics art in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonpassy.com/photos.php?gall_id=48]&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the Solidarity Trade Union Congress in Gdansk in the fall of 1981. In May 1987 Passy was the co-host-organizer of the first public opposition happening in Sofia University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonpassy.com/photos.php?gall_id=43]&lt;/ref&gt; After his efforts in communist Bulgaria,  in 1990-1991, as MP in the Grand National Assembly,  he co-authored the first democratic Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria and tabled the bill for abolishment of the death penalty in Bulgaria.

=== Atlantic and European integration ===
In August 1990 Passy, as a Member of Parliament, appealed to the Grand National Assembly and drafted the Parliamentary Bill for the withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and Bulgaria's accession to NATO.

Passy and others founded the ACB, which was succeeded by dozens of other Atlantic NGOs in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Asia, and Africa. The logo of the Atlantic Club – the NATO compass rose encircled by the 12 EU stars – became the symbol of unity of the Euro-Atlantic area adopted by number of the emerging Atlantic NGOs.

In November 1990 the ACB founders led by Passy made the first visit of an East European delegation to NATO HQ by invitation of NATO SG Manfred Wörner and the US Permanent Representative to NATO Ambassador William Taft IV, who supported the Bulgarian idea to establish ACB on a Warsaw Pact territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonpassy.com/uploads/articles/bg/filepath_6.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Bulgarian know-how was replicated in a joint statement by US Secretary of State James Baker and the Foreign Minister of Germany Hans-Dietrich Genscher in May 1991 who advocated the creation of Atlantic councils in other Warsaw Pact countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-club.org/index.php?en_history]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1991 NATO SG Manfred Wörner agreed to be "kidnapped" in Sofia by Solomon Passy in his East German car Trabant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vbox7.com/play:1f42fb1e3c] [http://www.solomonpassy.com/uploads/gallery/photo_big_200.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://solomonpassy.com/uploads/articles/bg/filepath_12.pdf Bulgarian press article]&lt;/ref&gt; Manfred Wörner became a supporter of ACB and personally endorsed in 1992 ACB's accession as first CEE member of ATA. ACB erected a monument in Sofia of him in 1996, which was inaugurated by his successor Javier Solana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonpassy.com/uploads/articles/en/filepath_16.pdf] [http://www.solomonpassy.com/uploads/gallery/photo_orig_667.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 14 years Solomon Passy worked on Bulgaria's membership of NATO, which was finalized on April 2, 2004 when Minister Passy raised the Bulgarian flag over NATO HQ in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vbox7.com/play:4ac0da43] [http://www.vbox7.com/play:b2a2503b09]&lt;/ref&gt;

Passy co-authored the bill concerning Bulgaria’s membership in the EU, adopted by the Grand National Assembly in December 1990. He negotiated as Foreign Minister the EU Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and signed it on April 25, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu2005.lu/en/calendrier/2005/04/25bg-ro/]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet was adopted as the third official EU alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/section/languages-culture/news/cyrillic-alphabet-makes-first-appearance-on-euro-notes/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1990 Passy became co-author of the draft of the Parliamentary Bill for Bulgaria's participation in the US-led coalition that liberated Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's occupation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solomonpassy.com/uploads/articles/bg/filepath_10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Passy proposed in 2003 the creation of joint US-Bulgarian defense facilities in Bulgaria - a project he ratified in 2006 as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Parliamentary Committee.

===Global affairs===
In 2001 Bulgaria was elected for rotational member of the UN Security Council (2002-2003); Passy represented Bulgaria on UNSC and chaired the Council in September 2002 and December 2003.

In 2004 Passy became the OSCE Chairman-in-Office. During his chairmanship the frozen conflict in Ajaria (Georgia) was solved, and Mongolia joined OSCE network.

Passy, Joschka Fischer, and Colin Powell hosted the OSCE Berlin Conference on Antisemitism (April 2004).

While Passy was part of King Simeon's Government, constructive and pragmatic relations with Russia were formed, following 45 years of de facto Soviet occupation of Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonpassy.com/uploads/gallery/photo_big_668.jpg Link]&lt;/ref&gt; Bilateral relations with China and India were refreshed and the Bulgarian diplomatic network with the Arab countries restored.

===Mediation and diplomatic action===
As Minister, Passy was responsible for the strategy of the EU-US-BG negotiating Troika with Libya’s dictator col. Gaddafi for the successful release (July 2007) of six Bulgarian medics held by Libya as hostages in 1999.

On behalf of the Western Allies Passy, as MP, undertook successful mediation missions in North Korea (July–August 2007), which eventually contributed to the destruction of the cooling tower for heavy water at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center (North Korea) - agreed upon the Six-Party Talks in September 27–30, 2007 - and to Summit meeting between North and South Korea. He mediated for the release of US citizen collaborators of George Soros detained in Iran in May 2007.

In 2007 Passy assumed a one-year assignment as an advisor to the Macedonian Government on NATO accession. In 2008 the Bucharest Summit of NATO agreed on Macedonia's membership of NATO, conditional on resolving the bilateral dispute with Greece.

In 2008 the government of Bulgaria nominated Solomon for Secretary General of NATO.

===Globalization of Bulgaria===
ACB is the first non-NATO NGO invited to join the [[Atlantic Treaty Association]], in 1992. Passy is the first non-NATO Vice-President of ATA (1996-1999). Bulgaria is the first non-NATO member state to host an ATA General Assembly (1997).

Passy and ACB in November 1994, invited Pope John Paul II to Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonpassy.com/uploads/gallery/photo_big_633.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; The visit, the first papal visit to Bulgaria, took place in 2002 when Passy was Foreign Minister; the Pope announced in Sofia that Bulgaria – contrary to widespread allegations — had not been involved in the 1981 attempt to assassinate the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlantic-club.org/content/articles/publications/201606_Memorandum_ACB-Holy-See_Newest.pdf] [http://solomonpassy.com/photos.php?gall_id=37 Link2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Passy co-chaired the host committee of the ACB-Tibetan Friendship Society for the visit to Bulgaria of the [[XIV Dalai Lama]] of Tibet in October 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solomonpassy.com/photos.php?gall_id=41] [http://facetibet.com/177/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9-%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%8F-4-5-%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%82] {{cite web |url=http://www.dalailama.com/biography/travels/1990---1999 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209220552/http://www.dalailama.com/biography/travels/1990---1999 |archivedate=2014-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passy's ACB hosted Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonpassy.com/photos.php?gall_id=45]&lt;/ref&gt; subsequent dialogue between the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Vatican eventually made the Bulgarian visit of Pope John Paul II possible.

In 1999 Passy became co-chair of the Host Committee for the first US presidential visit to Bulgaria, by [[President Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vbox7.com/play:6809b4cdd5 Link1], [http://vbox7.com/play:52ca4db1] [http://www.solomonpassy.com/uploads/gallery/photo_big_634.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Passy and ACB were involved in establishing the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute and the annual Antarctic Expedition as part of the national Antarctic Program. Bulgaria became the 28th Consultative Party to the [[Antarctic Treaty]] in 1998.

===Futuristic visions===
In 2007 Solomon Passy visited China by invitation of the Chinese Parliament and launched the creation of NATO-China Council and membership of China in OSCE.

In 2007 during a visit to Lhasa (Tibet) Passy launched the Theory of e-Democracy ([http://www.atlantic-club.org/content/articles/publications/2007-11-24_-_en.pdf Link]): a computerized simulator replacing elections and manned governments by optimizational algorithms guaranteeing sustainable increase of quality of life.

===Scientific===
Solomon Passy holds a PhD (1985) and M.Sc. (1979) in Mathematical Logic and Computer Sciences from Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski.

He has published dozens of [[academic paper]]s on mathematical logic and computer sciences. The Combinatory Dynamic Logic (Modal Logic with Nominals) was developed in Bulgaria by Solomon Passy and Professors Tinko Tinchev, George Gargov, Valentin Goranko, and Dimitar Vakarelov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solomonpassy.com/uploads/articles/en/filepath_10.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon’s scientific publications from 1980-1990s are widely cited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.bg/citations?hl=bg&amp;user=5ET4xTIAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works Google Scholar profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Solomon is a frequent commentator on international affairs, defense and security, and innovations for national and world media.

'''Tadeusz Kotarbiński''' ({{IPA-pol|'kotarbiński|lang}}; 31 March 1886 – 3 October 1981), was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[philosopher]], [[logician]] and [[ethicist]].

A pupil of [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], he was one of the most representative figures of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lwów–Warsaw School]], and a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] (PAU) as well as the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (PAN). He developed philosophical theory called ''[[reism]]'' ({{lang-pl|reizm}}) and an [[ethical system]] called independent ethics. Kotarbiński also contributed significantly to the development of [[praxeology]].

Henryk Greniewski and Kazimierz Pasenkiewicz have been doctoral students of Kotarbiński.

==Life==
Tadeusz Kotarbiński was born on 31 March 1886 in [[Warsaw]], then [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]], into an artist's family. His father, Miłosz Kotarbiński, was a painter and a pianist composer; his mother, Ewa de domo Koskowska. His uncles were - Józef Kotarbiński, an important figure in Polish theater circles and Wilhelm Kotarbiński - a talented painter. Expelled from secondary school in 1905 for participating in a strike, Kotarbiński managed to graduate two years later. He studied first as an unenrolled student at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]], attending mostly lectures on mathematics and physics; then architecture in [[Lvov]] and [[Darmstadt]], to finally settle for studies in philosophy and [[classical philology]] at the [[Lvov University]]. His professors were some of the most esteemed philosophers, logicians and mathematicians of his time: [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], Jan Łukasiewicz, Władysław Witwicki and [[philologist]] Stanisław Witkowski. He received his PhD degree with the thesis "Utilitarianism in the ethics of Mill and Spencer" in 1912.

After graduation he first worked as a secondary school [[classical language]]s teacher at the Rey Gymnasium in [[Warsaw]]. In 1918 Kotarbiński started lecturing career in philosophy at the [[Warsaw University]]. In years 1929/1930 he held the position of [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of [[Humanities]] Faculty. After the World War II, alongside other eminent men of learning, he helped to create a state university in Lodz. In 1945 professor Kotarbiński accepted the position of the first rector of the [[University of Lodz]], which he held until 1949 working simultaneously at the [[University of Warsaw]]. His model of work became a benchmark for the future generations of scientists and researchers working at the UL.

==Philosophy==

===Reism===
[[Reism]] is a pansomatism (from [[Greek language|Greek]]:πᾶν meaning "all" and σῶμα - "body") [[ontology]] as well as semantic theory developed by Kotarbiński and most extensively exposed in his major work: ''Elements of the Theory of Knowledge, Formal Logic and Methodology of the Sciences'', first published in 1929. Kotarbiński was the creator of the term [[reism]] - a word derived from the [[Latin]] "res" meaning "thing".

===Ontological reism===

Kotarbiński's ontological reism approach assumes that the only things that exist, and thus the only [[ontological category]] to be used, are individual, concrete objects (or bodies) in opposition to doctrines allowing for the existence of such categories as universals, states of affairs, properties, relations, sets, classes, mental constructs etc.

===Semantic reism===
In its sematic formulation Kotarbiński postulated that meaningful sentences have to contain so-called genuine names (referring to concrete objects) as opposed to abstract objects' names or non-genuine names (onomatoids). He also distinguished [[reism|onomatoids]] from empty names, which he considered to be reistic. Sentences with onomatoids only were in his view meaningless, whereas those with empty names meaningful.

Reism has been anticipated by philosophers preceding Kotarbiński ([[Leibnitz]], [[Brentano]] and his pupils and earlier [[nominalism|nominalists]] and [[materialism|materialists]]), but it was Kotarbiński who developed it to the complete, systematic exposition and gave it its name.

In 1958 in "Philosophical Studies" n4 (7) Kotarbiński published ''Developmental Stages of Concretism'', an essay in which he discussed the construction and evolution of his theory starting from the early concretism or [[nominalism]], passing through seven stages of re-elaboration and finally culminating in pansomatism. Kotarbiński used terms: [[reism]], pansomatism and concretism as equivalents to some extent throughout his works.

===Praxeology===
Kotarbiński was the most prominent representative and promoter of [[praxeology]] in Poland. Three years after publishing his major work on the subject: ''A Treatise on Good Work'' he persuaded [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] to establish a special unit called ''Workshop for Generic Work Organizational Issues'' (Pracownia Ogólnych Problemów Organizacji Pracy) later expanded into Department of Praxeology. Since 1962 it issued a periodical, called at first ''Praxeological Papers'' (Materiały Prakseologiczne), and then simply ''Praxeology'' (Prakseologia).

'''Wespazjan (Vespasian) Kochowski''' ([[coat of arms]]: [[Nieczuja]]) (1633 in Gaj, a village which no longer exists, near [[Waśniów]] in [[Sandomierz Land]] &amp;ndash; June 6, 1700 in [[Kraków]]) was one of the most noted [[historian]]s and [[poet]]s of [[Polish Baroque]], the most typical representative of the [[philosophy]] and [[literature]] of [[Sarmatism]].

== Life ==
Kochowski was associated with [[Małopolska]] during all his life. His parents were Jan (John), a middle rank nobleman (''[[szlachcic]]''), and Zofia (Sophie), née Janowski. He studied at the [[Bartłomiej Nowodworski High School|Nowodworski College]], in [[Kraków]]. Next, during ten years, he fought as [[Polish hussars|Polish winged hussar]] with [[Cossack]]s, [[Muscovy]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] (he took part, among others, in the [[battle of Beresteczko]]). In 1660 he came back to paternal Gaj, but he had to move to [[Goleniowy]] near [[Szczekociny]] in [[Kraków Land]].

His first publication was a [[poem]] entitled ''Kamień świadectwa wielkiego w Koronie Polskiej senatora niewinności'' (''The Stone of Testimony of the Innocence of the Great Senator of Polish Kingdom'') in the defence of [[Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski]]. In 1668 he published his first volume, ''Różaniec Najświętszej Panny Maryi'' (''The Rosary of Holy Virgin Mary''), which considers each secrets of [[rosary]].

During that time, Kochowski was involved in political life (regional [[Town council|council]]s, state [[parliament]]s, local [[office]]s), gaining large respect among the nobility. He was even the podżupnik (administrator) of huge [[salt mine]]s in [[Wieliczka]] near [[Kraków]].

In 1674 he published his first masterpiece — ''[[Niepróżnujące próżnowanie]]'' (''Not idling idleness''). This is a collection of several hundreds verses, divided in four books of [[lyrics]], one book of [[epode]]s and two books of [[epigram]]s. He showed the variety of topics, feelings, stylistic figures and [[Poetry|versification]] forms. He expressed the care of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], praised its triumphs, criticised its weaknesses, encouraged compatriots to defence it; he glorified life in the country and his paternal region, thanked [[God]] for looking for him and also joked at many ordinary situations in life.

In 1681 Kochowski also wrote two religious poems: ''Chrystus cierpiący'' (''Suffering Christ''), which laments the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of Our Lord, and ''Ogród panieński'' (''Virgin's Garden''), which explains the titles of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]].

During the [[reign]] of [[John III Sobieski]] he turned towards [[history]]. In 1683 he wrote ''Annales Poloniae ab obitu Vladislai IV'' (''The [[Annals]] of [[Poland]] from the [[Death]] of [[Ladislas IV]]''), commonly called ''[[Klimaktery]]'' (''[[Climacter]]s''). This is the [[history]] of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] under kings [[John II Casimir]] and [[Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki]]. Kochowski had used the [[information]] from many [[witness]]es, [[document]]s and his own [[experience]]s and he had done it so well. This [[book]] is one of the main [[Source text|source]]s for the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|old Polish]] [[history]].

In 1683 Kochowski took part in the [[battle of Vienna]] as ''historiographus privilegiatus'' (the [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]d [[historian]]); a position granted to him by king [[Jan III Sobieski]], an admirer of his historian skills. Next year he published the official [[report|relation]] from that – ''Commentarius belli adversus Turcas'' (''[[Memoirs]] from the [[war]] against [[Turkish people|Turks]]''). He also tried to make the national [[Epic poetry|epos]], but he managed to write only one [[canto]], edited as ''Dzieło Boskie albo Pieśni Wiednia wybawionego'' (''The Work of God or Songs of Liberated Vienna'', also in 1684.

The last, most original and interesting piece of Kochowski was ''Trybut należyty wdzięczności wszystkiego dobrego Dawcy, Panu i Bogu albo Psalmodia polska za dobrodziejstwa Boskie dziękująca'' (''The Appropriate [[Gift]] of [[Gratefulness]] for the Giver of Everything Good, [[Lord]] and [[God]], or [[Poland|Polish]] [[Psalmody]], Thanking for the [[God]]'s [[Common good|Benefits]]'') from 1695, usually called simply ''[[Psalmodia polska]]'' (''The Polish Psalmody''). It distinguishes itself, on one hand, by the [[Bible]] stylization, and on the other hand, by the change of point of view from [[Hebrew]] to [[Poles|Pole]], from [[Jew]] to [[Christian]], from [[ancient history|ancient]] person to [[early modern times|modern]] one. There are mixed 14 private and 22 public [[psalm]]s. It tells about the [[expiation]] and the [[God's mercy]], [[moderation]] of greeds and believing in the [[Divine Providence|providence]] (''złota mierność'' – ''the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]''), special role of [[Poland]] in the [[world]] (''antemurale christianitatis'' – ''the [[bulwark]] of [[Christianity]]'') and the superiority of [[Poland|Polish]] [[political system]] (''złota wolność'' – ''the golden [[liberty]]''). ''[[Psalmodia polska]]'' is recognized as one of the main [[monument]]s of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|old Polish]] [[literature]] and the best synthesis of [[Sarmatism]].

In 1658 Kochowski married Marianna (Marianne) Misiowska. They had a son, Hieronim Franciszek (Jerome Francis), as late as 1674. After the [[death]] of Marianna in 1677 he married rich widow Magdalena (Madeline) Frezer. In 1696 she also died.

He was the best [[friend]] of [[Jan Gawiński]], which was also a good [[poet]]. His [[friend]]s were also [[Stefan Bidziński]] (a well-known [[soldier]]), [[Hieronim Komornicki]] ([[abbot]] of [[Święty Krzyż]]) and [[Pakosław Lanckoroński]] (a [[politician]]).

Kochowski was very popular in his time. He was also so popular in the last period of [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] and [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|between the Wars]]. Last time he is more and more esteemed again.
