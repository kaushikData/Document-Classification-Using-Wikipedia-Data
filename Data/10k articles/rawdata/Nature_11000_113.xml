'''3122 Florence''' is a stony&lt;ref name="JPLnews200" /&gt; [[Trinary asteroid|trinary]]&lt;ref name="CNEOS" /&gt; [[asteroid]] of the [[Amor asteroid|Amor]] group. It is classified as a [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]]. It measures approximately 5 kilometers in [[diameter]]. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–2.5&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 2 years and 4 months (859 days); the orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.42 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 22[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; Florence has [[#Moons|two moons]].

Florence was discovered on 2 March 1981 by American astronomer [[Schelte J. Bus|Schelte J. "Bobby" Bus]] at [[Siding Spring Observatory]].&lt;ref name="MPC-Florence" /&gt; Its provisional designation was {{mp|1981 ET|3}}. It was named in honor of [[Florence Nightingale]], the founder of modern nursing;&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; the naming citation was published on 6 April, 1993 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Center#Publications|M.P.C.]] 21955}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

Florence is classified as a [[potentially hazardous object]] because its [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] {{nowrap|(''MOID'' ≤ 0.05 AU)}} indicates that it has the potential to make close approaches to the Earth, and because measurements of its [[absolute magnitude]] {{nowrap|(''H''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;22)}} suggest that it is large enough to create serious damage were it to impact.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NEOP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/groups.html |title=NEO Groups |series=Near Earth Object Program |publisher=NASA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102020040/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/groups.html |archivedate=November 2, 2016 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moons ==
[[File:3122 Florence with moons.jpg|thumb|left|[[Trinary asteroid]]: ''Florence'' with its two [[Minor-planet moon|satellites]]]]

Radar observations during the 2017 flyby have shown that Florence has two moons. The inner of the two moons is estimated to have a diameter of 180 to 240 meters, the outer moon is between 300 and 360 meters across. Each moon is somewhat elongated, and both are [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] to the main body. They probably formed as loose material spun away from the main body as its rotation accelerated due to the [[YORP effect]].&lt;ref name="JPLnews200" /&gt;

The inner moon's period orbiting Florence appears to be approximately 7 hours, while the outer moon completes a revolution in about 21 to 23 hours. The inner moon of Florence has the shortest orbital period of any of the moons of the 60 near-Earth asteroids known to have moons.&lt;ref name="JPLnews200" /&gt;

Florence is only the third known trinary asteroid in the near-Earth asteroid population, after [[(153591) 2001 SN263|{{mp|(153591) 2001 SN|3}}]] and [[(136617) 1994 CC|{{mp|(136617) 1994 CC}}]].

== 2017 close approach ==
{{As of | 2017 | alt=On 1 September 2017, Florence passed}} {{convert|0.047237|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth, approximately eighteen times the average distance of the Moon.&lt;ref name="jpl-close" /&gt; As seen from Earth, it brightened to [[apparent magnitude]] 8.5, and was visible in small telescopes for several nights as it moves south to north through the constellations [[Piscis Austrinus]], [[Capricornus]], [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], and [[Delphinus]]. This was the asteroid's closest approach since 1890 and the closest until after 2500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nasa says big asteroid to pass safely by Earth on 1 September|url=http://www.livemint.com/Science/0Far3fmQLS4Bq6kUXKrMjM/Nasa-says-big-asteroid-to-pass-safely-by-Earth-on-1-Septembe.html|agency=Livemint|date=2017-08-18|author=PTI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/see-asteroid-florence-fly-by-earth-this-week/|title=Asteroid Florence Pays Earth a Visit – Sky &amp; Telescope|date=30 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrobob.areavoices.com/2017/08/30/see-florence-one-of-largest-near-earth-asteroids-zip-by-earth/|title=See Florence, One Of The Largest Near-Earth Asteroids, Zip By Earth|date=30 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its previous flyby was on August 29, 1930, at a distance of 0.05239 AU and the next one will be on September 2, 2057, at 0.049952 AU.&lt;ref name="radar planning"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/Florence/Florence_planning.html |title=Goldstone Radar Observations Planning: Asteroid 3122 Florence and 2001 QL142| publisher=NASA |date= 29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eros''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪər|ɒ|s}} {{respell|EER|os}}; [[minor planet designation]]: '''433 Eros'''), provisional designation {{mp|1898 DQ}}, is a stony and elongated [[asteroid]] of the  [[Amor asteroid|Amor group]] and the first discovered and second-largest [[near-Earth object]] with a mean-diameter of approximately 16.8 kilometers. [[List of minor planets visited by spacecraft|Visited]] by the [[NEAR Shoemaker]] space probe in 1998, it became the first asteroid ever studied from orbit.

The eccentric asteroid was discovered by German astronomer [[Carl Gustav Witt]] at the [[IAU code#537|Berlin Urania Observatory]] on 13 August 1898, and later named after [[Eros]], a god from [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== History ==
=== Discovery ===

Eros was discovered on 13 August 1898, by [[Carl Gustav Witt]] at [[IAU code#537|Berlin Urania Observatory]] and [[Auguste Charlois]] at [[Nice Observatory]].&lt;ref name=Scholl/&gt; Witt was taking a 2-hour exposure of [[Beta Aquarii]] to secure astrometric positions of asteroid [[185 Eunike]].&lt;ref name=yeomans/&gt;

=== Later studies ===

During the opposition of 1900–1901, a worldwide program was launched to make [[parallax]] measurements of Eros to determine the [[solar parallax]] (or distance to the Sun), with the results published in 1910 by [[Arthur Hinks]] of [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=Hinks/&gt; A similar program was then carried out, during a closer approach, in 1930–1931 by [[Harold Spencer Jones]].&lt;ref name=Jones1941/&gt; The value of the [[Astronomical Unit]] (roughly the Earth-Sun distance) obtained by this program was considered definitive until 1968, when [[radar]] and [[dynamical parallax]] methods started producing more precise measurements.

Eros was the first asteroid detected by the [[Arecibo Observatory]]'s radar system.&lt;ref name=Butrica /&gt;&lt;ref name="AsteroidRadarAstronomy" /&gt;

Eros was one of the first asteroids visited by a spacecraft, the first one orbited, and the first one soft-landed on. [[NASA]] spacecraft [[NEAR Shoemaker]] entered orbit around Eros in 2000, and landed in 2001.

=== Mars-crosser ===

Eros is a [[Mars-crosser asteroid]], the first known to come within the orbit of [[Mars]]. Objects in such an orbit can remain there for only a few hundred million years before the orbit is [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] by gravitational interactions. Dynamical integrations suggest that Eros may evolve into an [[Earth-crosser asteroid|Earth-crosser]] within as short an interval as two million years, and has a roughly 50% chance of doing so over a time scale of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name = "Michel"/&gt; It is a potential Earth [[Impact event|impactor]],&lt;ref name = "Michel"/&gt; about five times larger than the impactor that created [[Chicxulub crater]] and led to the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction of the dinosaurs]].{{efn|name="ratio"}}

=== Name ===

Eros is named after the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] of [[love]], [[Eros (god)|Erōs]]. It is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪər|ɒ|s}} {{respell|EER|os}} or sometimes {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛr|ɒ|s}} {{respell|ERR|os}}. The rarely used adjectival form of the name is ''Erotian'' {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|r|oʊ|ʃ|ən}}. Eros is also the first masculine name for an asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17301161|title=The asteroids|last=1920-1992.|first=Asimov, Isaac,|date=1988|publisher=G.

The [[NEAR Shoemaker]] probe visited Eros twice, first with a 1998 [[Planetary flyby|flyby]], and then by orbiting it in 2000 when it extensively photographed its surface. On February 12, 2001, at the end of its mission, it landed on the asteroid's surface using its maneuvering jets.

== Physical characteristics ==

[[Surface gravity]] depends on the distance from a spot on the surface to the center of a body's mass. Eros's surface gravity varies greatly because Eros is not a sphere but an elongated peanut-shaped (or potato- or shoe-shaped) object. The daytime temperature on Eros can reach about {{convert|100|C|K}} at [[perihelion]]. Nighttime measurements fall near {{convert|-150|C|K}}. Eros's density is 2.67 [[Gram per cubic centimetre|g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], about the same as the density of Earth's crust. It rotates once every 5.27 hours.

NEAR scientists have found that most of the larger rocks strewn across Eros were ejected from a single [[impact crater|crater]] in an impact approximately 1 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="ThomasVeverka2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=P. C.|last2=Veverka|first2=J.|last3=Robinson|first3=M. S.|last4=Murchie |first4=S.| title =Shoemaker crater as the source of most ejecta blocks on the asteroid 433 Eros|journal=Nature |volume=413 |issue=6854|date=2001-09-27 |pages=394–396|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/35096513|bibcode = 2001Natur.413..394T |pmid=11574880}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The crater involved was proposed to be named "Shoemaker", but is not recognized as such by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), and has been formally designated Charlois Regio.) This event may also be responsible for the 40 percent of the Erotian surface that is devoid of craters smaller than 0.5 kilometers across. It was originally thought that the debris thrown up by the collision filled in the smaller craters. An analysis of crater densities over the surface indicates that the areas with lower crater density are within 9 kilometers of the impact point. Some of the lower density areas were found on the opposite side of the asteroid but still within 9 kilometers.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

It is theorized that [[seismic]] shockwaves propagated through the asteroid, shaking smaller craters into rubble. Since Eros is irregularly shaped, parts of the surface antipodal to the point of impact can be within 9 kilometres of the impact point (measured in a straight line through the asteroid) even though some intervening parts of the surface are more than 9 kilometres away in straight-line distance. A suitable analogy would be the distance from the top centre of a bun to the bottom centre as compared to the distance from the top centre to a point on the bun's circumference: top-to-bottom is a longer distance than top-to-periphery when measured along the surface but shorter than it in direct straight-line terms.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

Compression from the same impact is believed to have created the [[thrust fault]] Hinks Dorsum.&lt;ref name="WattersThomas-2011" /&gt;

Data from the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft collected on Eros in December 1998 suggests that it could contain 20,000 billion kilograms of aluminum and similar amounts of metals that are rare on Earth, such as gold and platinum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold rush in space?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/401227.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visibility from Earth ==
[[File:Eros_path_2012.png|thumb|Path in sky during opposition 2011/2012]]
On January 31, 2012, Eros passed Earth at {{convert|0.17867|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}},&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEODyS"/&gt; about 70 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|distance to the Moon]], with a [[apparent magnitude|visual magnitude]] of +8.1.&lt;ref name=AstDys-Eros2012/&gt; During rare oppositions, every 81 years, such as in 1975 and 2056, Eros can reach a magnitude of +7.0,&lt;ref name=NEODys-Eros2137/&gt; which is brighter than [[Neptune#Observation|Neptune]] and brighter than any [[main-belt asteroid]] except [[1 Ceres]], [[4 Vesta#Visibility|4 Vesta]] and, rarely, [[2 Pallas#Characteristics|2 Pallas]] and [[7 Iris]]. Under this condition, the asteroid actually appears to stop, but unlike the normal condition for a body in heliocentric conjunction with Earth, its [[Apparent retrograde motion|retrograde]] motion is very small. For example, in January and February 2137, it moves retrograde only 34 minutes in right ascension.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt;

{{Campaignbox War of 1812: Naval}}

The '''Action off Charles Island''' was a naval battle fought during the [[War of 1812]] in the summer of 1813 off [[Floreana Island|Charles Island]] in the [[Galapagos]]. An [[United States|American]] squadron of three vessels attacked three [[United Kingdom|British]] armed [[whaling|whalers]], and captured them. The engagement was notable for being one of the few to occur in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during the war and involved [[United States Marine]] [[Lieutenant]] [[John M. Gamble]], the first U.S. Marine to command an American warship.&lt;ref name="Hearn, pg 21"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hearn |first=G. Chester |title=Marines: An Illustrated History: the United States Marine Corps from 1775 to the 21st Century |year=2007 |publisher=MBI Publishing Company|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the War of 1812 between the United Kingdom and the United States, American [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], in the thirty-six gun [[frigate]] {{USS|Essex|1799|6}}, led a fleet of armed vessels in the South Pacific in a [[commerce raiding]] operation. At the time of the action, ''Essex'' was accompanied by two smaller vessels, recently captured from the British and classified as [[sloops-of-war]] by Captain Porter. They were the 10-gun {{ship||Greenwich|1813|2}} of 338 tons [[Builder's Old Measurement|burthen]] and the 8-gun {{ship||Georgiana|1791 ship|2}} of 280 tons burthen. Porter had sent the rest of his fleet to [[Valparaiso]], Chile, to be sold while he and the remaining vessels patrolled for British [[whaler]]s between [[Tumbes, Peru|Tumbes]], [[Peru]] and the Galapagos.&lt;ref name="Gamble, pg 3-9"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gamble |first=M. John |title=The memorial of Lieut. Colonel J.M. Gamble, of the United States' Marine Corps, to Congress, 1828 |year=1828 |publisher= Geo. F. Hopkins &amp; Son|pages=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leatherneckmagazine-digital.com/leatherneckmagazine/200805/?pg=4#pg4|title=Sound off|publisher=Leatherneck Magazine|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/war-of-1812-commodore-david-porter-and-the-essex-in-the-south-pacific.htm|title=War of 1812: Commodore David Porter and the Essex in the South Pacific|publisher=HistoryNet.com|date=September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Porter had entered the Pacific with no more than 350 American servicemen under his command, when he took prizes he could only place small [[skeleton crew]]s in most of his ships. ''Georgiana'' had a complement of forty-two men under Mr. Adams, the ''Essex''{{'}}s [[chaplain]], and ''Greenwich'' held only fourteen men under the command of Lieutenant Gamble, USMC.

==Action==
[[File:John M. Gamble.jpg|200px|left|thumb|''John M. Gamble'']]
There is some confusion as to the date of the battle; in later memoirs, Lieutenant Gamble recalled that it was fought on 12 or 13 July, while Captain Porter's memoir, and letters from Porter to Gamble, stated that it occurred on 14 July. Either way, at about 11:00 AM the Americans were sailing west from [[Tumbes, Peru]], off [[Banks Bay]] (Bahia de Bancos) in the Galapagos, when they sighted three sets of sails on the horizon. Commodore Porter signaled his ships to prepare for action and a chase began. At the time, the majority of British ships cruising in the South Pacific were whalers sailing under [[letter of marque|letters of marque]], legally permitting them to act as [[privateer]]s should the opportunity arise.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;All the vessels that Porter captured had crews whose size was more consistent with their being letters of marque than privateers. Vessels intending to engage in privateering had large crews, larger even than those of similarly-sized naval vessels, in order to be able to put prize crews on board their captures, while continuing to hunt for more prey. Porter himself suffered from having too few men to man adequately all his prizes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first British vessel Porter captured was the [[brig]] {{ship||Charlton|1803 ship|2}} of ten guns. ''Charlton'' was sailing in the center of the three ships, and she surrendered to ''Essex'' without a fight as ''Greenwich'' and ''Georgiana'' went after {{ship||Seringapatam|1799 ship|2}}.&lt;ref name="Gamble, pg 3-9" /&gt;

''Seringapatam'' had made several whaling and sealing voyages to the South Atlantic and this area since 1800. She had a 41-man crew under the command of Captain William Stavers and was armed with fourteen 9-pounder guns. On this voyage she had captured one American whaler on the way to the whaling grounds.

When escape seemed unlikely, ''Seringapatam'' changed course and appeared to be sailing to engage ''Greenwich'' but the latter came to a halt and waited for ''Georgiana'' to come up and provide assistance. At this point, as four men were transferred from ''Georgiana'' to ''Greenwich'', Captain Stavers chose to break off the attack and flee. Lieutenant Gamble closed the distance between the two ships and he first demanded that the British surrender. But when the Americans came within pistol range, ''Seringapatam'' raised her colors and fired a powerful broadside.&lt;ref name="Gamble, pg 3-9" /&gt;

''Greenwich'' immediately returned fire with small arms and cannon, and for several moments the two vessels exchanged fire. American fire proved to be more accurate, and after taking heavy damage the British struck their colors and ''Greenwich'' ceased her firing. Just as Lieutenant Gamble was preparing to board the enemy, ''Seringapatam'' attempted another escape. Gamble ordered his men to resume shooting at the sails of the British vessel and eventually brought her to a halt. Meanwhile, ''Essex'' had finished pursuing the small 8-gun {{ship||New Zealander|1808 ship|2}} and captured her without difficulty. Captain Porter then assisted in chasing down ''Seringapatam''.&lt;ref name="Gamble, pg 3-9" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Commodore Porter off Nuku Hiva.gif|300px|right|thumb|''Captain Porter's fleet off Nuku Hiva in October of 1813.'']]
American sources make no mention of casualties on either side, though ''Greenwich'' sustained some damage and ''Seringapatam'' was crippled. Porter took 89 prisoners in all, and the American ships were already filled with captives, so the Americans disarmed ''Charlton'', loaded her with 48 of the prisoners, and sent her to [[Rio de Janeiro]] as a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]] with the prisoners under parole with orders to surrender to the first American authority they encountered. ''Lloyd's List'' reported that ''Essex'' had captured ''Seringapatam'', Stavers, master; ''New Zealander'', Donneman, master; and ''Charlton'', Halcrow, master.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044105232912?urlappend=%3Bseq=419 ''Lloyd's List'', 11 January 1814 - accessed 11 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Stavers, when asked to surrender his privateer's commission, revealed that though he had applied for a [[letter of marque]], he had not yet received one, but that it was probably waiting for him in Lima.{{refn|One had been issued on 12 December 1812.&lt;ref name=LoM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1812privateers.org/Great%20Britain/marque1793-1815.pdf|title=Letter of Marque, p.86 - accessed 25 July 2017.|publisher=|access-date=27 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020052005/http://www.1812privateers.org/Great%20Britain/marque1793-1815.pdf|archive-date=20 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Captain Porter announced that Stavers would be taken to the United States and be tried as a pirate, and ordered him and his crew to be put in irons. They were given more freedom after some liberated American whalers told Porter that the British had treated them well during their time as prisoners aboard ''Seringapatam''.&lt;ref name="Gamble, pg 3-9" /&gt;

The American press declared ''Seringapatam'' to have been a formidable threat to American commerce in the Pacific, making Lieutenant Gamble famous, with the consequence that he received many letters of congratulations from naval officers. ''Seringapatam'' was found to have carried up to 30,000 dollars worth of armaments and provisions. Gamble was promoted to captain and died in 1836 as a [[lieutenant colonel]]. However, despite a petition to the U.S. Congress, he never received any prize money for the capture or his subsequent service.&lt;ref name="United States Senate, pg 84"&gt;{{cite book |last=United States Senate |title=Index to the Miscellaneous Documents of the Senate of the United States|year=1871|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the engagement, Captain Porter made for [[Nuku Hiva]] in the [[Marquesas]] where he built America's first base in the Pacific and repaired his ships. He then sailed off, leaving ''Greenwich'', ''Seringapatam'', and another prize, {{ship||Sir Andrew Hammond|1800 ship|2}}, behind. It was after his departure that the [[Nuku Hiva Campaign#Seringnapatam Mutiny|''Seringapatam'' Mutiny]] occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycentral.com/navy/MISC%202/seringapatam.html |title=USS Seringapatam |publisher=Navyhistory.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306060055/http://www.historycentral.com/navy/MISC%202/seringapatam.html |archivedate=2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutineers and British prisoners-of-war recaptured ''Seringapatam'' and sailed her to Australia, from where she was returned to her owners. Gamble burned ''Greenwich'' before leaving Nuka Hiva in ''Sir Andrew Hammond''.

Earthenware comprises&lt;blockquote&gt;most building bricks, nearly all European pottery up to the seventeenth century, most of the wares of Egypt, Persia and the near East; Greek, Roman and Mediterranean, and some of the Chinese; and the fine earthenware which forms the greater part of our tableware today.&lt;ref name=billington&gt;Dora Billington, ''The Technique of Pottery'', London: B.T.Batsford, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Pit fired pottery|Pit fired earthenware]] dates back to as early as 29,000&amp;ndash;25,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]],&lt;ref name="RichersonLee1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David W.

Outside [[East Asia]], porcelain was manufactured only from the 18th century AD, and then initially as an expensive luxury.

After it is fired, earthenware is opaque and non-vitreous,&lt;ref name=EU&gt;Combined Nomenclature of the [[European Union]] Published by the EC Commission in Luxembourg, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; soft and capable of being scratched with a knife.&lt;ref name=billington/&gt; The [[Combined Nomenclature]] of the European Communities describes it as being made of selected [[clay]]s sometimes mixed with [[feldspar]]s and varying amounts of other minerals, and white or light-colored (i.e., slightly greyish, cream, or ivory).&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Generally, earthenware bodies exhibit higher [[Plasticity (physics)#Plasticity in soils and sand|plasticity]] than most whiteware&lt;ref&gt;An industry term for ceramics including tableware and sanitary ware&lt;/ref&gt; bodies and hence are easier to shape by [[RAM press]], [[Glossary of pottery terms#R|roller-head]] or [[potter's wheel]] than bone china or porcelain.&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;Whitewares: Testing and Quality Control. W.Ryan and C.Radford. Institute of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pottery Science: Materials, Process And Products. Allen Dinsdale. Ellis Horwood. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its porosity, earthenware, with a water absorption of 5-8%, must be [[ceramic glaze|glazed]] to be watertight.&lt;ref&gt;Ceramics Glaze Technology. J. R. Taylor &amp; A. C. Bull. Institute of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Earthenware has lower [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength]] than bone china, porcelain or stoneware, and consequently articles are commonly made in thicker cross-section, although they are still more easily chipped.&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt;

Darker-colored [[terracotta]] earthenware, typically orange or red due to a comparatively high content of [[iron oxide]], are widely used for flower pots, tiles and some decorative and oven ware.&lt;ref name=billington/&gt;

==Production==

A general body formulation for contemporary earthenware is 25% [[kaolin]], 25% [[ball clay]], 35% [[quartz]] and 15% [[feldspar]].&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Ceramics, 3rd edition. A. E. Dodd &amp; D. Murfin. Maney Publishing. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studio potters follow the reverse practice, with a low-temperature biscuit firing and a high-temperature glost firing. The firing schedule will be determined by the raw materials used and the desired characteristics of the finished ware.

Historically, such high temperatures were unattainable in most cultures and periods until modern times, though [[Chinese ceramics]] were far ahead of other cultures in this respect. Earthenware can be produced at firing temperatures as low as {{convert|600|C|F}} and many clays will not fire successfully above about {{convert|1000|C|F}}.  Much historical pottery was fired somewhere around {{convert|800|C|F}}, giving a wide margin of error where there was no precise way of measuring temperature, and very variable conditions within the kiln. 

After firing, most earthenware bodies will be colored white, buff or red. For red earthenware, the firing temperature affects the color of the clay body. Lower temperatures produce a typical red terracotta color; higher temperatures will make the clay brown or even black. Higher firing temperatures may cause earthenware to [[List of pottery terms#B|bloat]].

There are several types of earthenware, including:

*[[Terracotta]]: a term used for a rather random group of types of objects, rather than being defined by technique
*[[Tin-glazed pottery]], or [[Faience]]
**[[Maiolica]]
**[[Delftware]]
*[[Lead-glazed earthenware]]
*[[Redware]] (America)
**[[Victorian majolica]]
**[[Creamware]]
*[[Lusterware]] with special iridescent glazes

[[File:Ebisu - color.jpg|thumb|upright|150px]]
{{nihongo|'''Ebisu'''|恵比須, 恵比寿, 夷, 戎}}, also transliterated {{nihongo|'''Webisu'''|ゑびす||see [[historical kana orthography]]}} or called {{nihongo|'''Hiruko'''|蛭子}} or {{nihongo|'''Kotoshiro-nushi-no-kami'''|事代主神}}, is the [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] god of fishermen and [[luck]]. He is one of the {{nihongo|[[Seven Gods of Fortune]]|七福神|Shichifukujin}}, and the only one of the seven to originate purely from Japan without any Hindu influence.

==Origins as Hiruko==
In medieval times, Ebisu's origin came to be tied together with that of ''Hiruko'' - the first child of [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]], born without bones (or, in some stories, without arms and legs) due to his mother's transgression during the marriage ritual. Hiruko struggled to survive but, as he could not stand, he was cast into the sea in a boat of reeds before his third birthday.&lt;ref name="Kojiki"&gt;
{{cite web
| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/kojiki.htm
| title = Kojiki
| accessdate = 2006-09-09
| author = B.H. Chamberlain, translator
| year = 1882
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story tells that Hiruko eventually washed ashore—possibly in {{nihongo|[[Ezo]]|蝦夷||ancient [[Hokkaidō]]}}—and was cared for by the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] {{nihongo|''Ebisu Saburo''|戎三郎}}. It is however believed that Ebisu first arose as a god among fishermen and that his origin as Hiruko was a much later conception, after the worship of him had spread to merchants and others. It is also theorized that he was originally a god known as "Kotoronushi no Mikoto", son of [[Ōkuninushi]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Nipponica (Shogakukan): "えびす"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
[[Image:EbisuStationStatue6464.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stature of Ebisu in front of [[Ebisu Station (Tokyo)|Ebisu Station]], [[Tokyo]]]]
The weak child overcame many hardships, grew legs (and, presumably, the rest of his skeletal structure) at the age of three, and became the god Ebisu.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} He remains slightly crippled and deaf, but mirthful and auspicious nonetheless (hence the title, "The laughing god"). He is often depicted wearing a tall hat—the {{nihongo|''Kazaori Eboshi''|風折烏帽子}}—holding a rod and a large [[red sea bream]] or [[Suzuki (fish)|sea bass]]. [[Jellyfish]] are also associated with the god and the [[fugu]] restaurants of Japan will often incorporate Ebisu in their motif.

==Cultural relevance==
Ebisu's festival is celebrated on the twentieth day of the tenth month, ''[[Kannazuki]]'' (the month without gods).  While the other myriad of members{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} of the Japanese pantheon gather at [[The Grand Shrine of Izumo]], Ebisu does not hear the summons and is thus still available for worship.

Ebisu is frequently paired with [[Daikokuten]], another of the seven gods of Fortune, in displays of the twin patrons by small shopkeepers. In some versions of the [[mythology|myth]] they are father and son (or master and apprentice). Also, these two are often joined by [[Fukurokuju]] as the "Three Gods of Good Fortune".

As a form of [[animal worship]]ping, Ebisu was often referred to marine [[megafauna]]s such as [[whales]] and [[whale shark]]s (hence being also called as "Ebisu-Shark") that bring mass of fish and protect fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=村上健司 編著|title=日本妖怪大事典 |year=2005 |publisher=角川書店 |series=Kwai books |isbn=978-4-04-883926-6 |pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="大藤1955"&gt;{{Cite book |author=大藤時彦他 |editor=民俗学研究所編|others=柳田國男 監修 |title=綜合日本民俗語彙 |year=1955 |publisher=平凡社 |volume=第2巻 |pages=763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebisu is depicted or parodied in a wide range of media, from artwork to costumed impersonations at local festivals and in commercial logos and advertisements. One of the most widely recognized product logos is in association with Yebisu beer, which was first brewed in 1890, and is currently brewed by [[Sapporo Brewery]].

Ebisu is the basis of the name of the clothing brand [[Evisu]].

The '''FIG World Rankings''' is a system determining a list of the World's best gymnasts competing on the [[Artistic Gymnastics World Cup]]. A separate [[Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup|World ranking]] system is also used for [[Rhythmic Gymnastics]].

Throughout the year, there are Challenge and Challenger World Cups for CII (all-around) and CIII (events) formats. A win on each event is a maximum of 50 points for a World Cup competition&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/publicdir/rules/files/art/ART%20CII%20WCup%20Rules%20%202013-2016%20(English)%2020160125_clean.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and 30 points for a World Challenge Cup competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/publicdir/rules/files/art/GA_2016_CIII_WCup_Rules-e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-dimensional [[Computer model|model]] typically are unmanageable or demand huge computational efforts when applied to natural-scale geophysical mass flows, which can involve masses as large as &lt;math&gt;10^6&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;10^{13}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;{m}^3&lt;/math&gt;. One way to make the problem more tractable is to assume that flows are long (or wide) relative to their depth, and to use depth-averaging in the direction normal to the sliding surface.  This dramatically reduces the complexity associated with the flow from three-dimension to virtually shallow flow so that the computational cost is very low.

This is achieved by using the concept of factorization of the mean. This is a very fundamental concept widely accepted and used in shallow flow modelling, including the [[Waves and shallow water|shallow water]] flow, [[granular]] [[avalanches]], [[debris flows]], [[flash flood]], [[tsunami]] and other type geophysical mass flows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.fl.13.010181.000421 Takahashi, T., 1981. Debris flow, Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., 13, 57–77.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Matthias |last=Jakob|first2= Oldrich |last2=Hungr|publisher=Springer |year=2005|isbn=3-540-20726-0 |title=Debris-flow hazards and related phenomena|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w4_QA22J4FoC|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that the average of a product is approximated by the product of the averages. This simplification and approximation has great contributions in depth averaging the mass and momentum balance equations and associated expressions in mass flow modellings. This allows, for example, approximating the velocities by their means. This is mainly based on the observed phenomena that in smooth gravity- or pressure-driven geophysical and industrial mass flows, the momentum transfer in the direction normal to the main flow direction is negligible. Or in other words, the aspect ratio (typical flow depth divided by typical flow extent) is very small, or to say equivalently, the flow depth is much smaller than a typical wave length (long wave approximation).

Bower|publisher = [[Geneva Press]]|quote=Maundy Thursday (or ''le mandé''; Thursday of the ''Mandatum'', Latin, commandment)|accessdate = 11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Washing of the Feet''', is a religious [[rite]] observed by various [[Christian]] [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]]. The name is taken from the first few Latin words sung at the ceremony of the washing of the feet, "''Mandatum novum do vobis ut diligatis invicem sicut dilexi vos''" ("I give you a new commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you") ({{bibleverse||John|13:34|NKJV}}), and from the Latin form of the commandment of Christ that we should imitate His loving humility in the washing of the feet ({{bibleverse||John|13:14–17|NKJV}}). The term ''mandatum'' (maundy), therefore, was applied to the rite of foot-washing on this day of the Christian [[Holy Week]] called [[Maundy Thursday]].

[[Gospel of John|John]] 13:1–17 recounts [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]' performance of this act. In verses 13:14–17, He instructs His [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]]:

{{quote|If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.|John 13:14–17 (NKJV)}}

Many denominations (including [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]], [[Lutherans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Presbyterians]], [[Mennonites]], and [[Catholics]]) therefore observe the liturgical washing of the feet on [[Maundy Thursday]] of [[Holy Week]].&lt;ref name="common" /&gt; Moreover, for some [[Christian denominations|denominations]], foot-washing was an example, a pattern. Many groups throughout Church history and many modern denominations have practiced foot washing as a [[Ordinance (Christian)|church ordinance]] including [[Adventists]], [[Anabaptists]], [[Baptists]], and [[Pentecostals]].&lt;ref name="common" /&gt;

== Etymology ==

The origin of the word ''Maundy'' has at least two possibilities:
# Through Middle English and Old French ''mandé'', from Latin ''mandatum''.
# From the Latin ''mendicare'', Old French ''mendier'', and English ''maund'', which means "to beg" (verb) or a "small basket" (noun) held out by maunders (beggars) as they maunded (begged).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://disciplingsmlc.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/notes-about-lent-and-holy-week/ |title=Notes about Lent and Holy Week |website=Discipling Ministry |location=Frazier Park, California |publisher=Shepherd of the Mountains Lutheran Church |date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The root of this practice appears to be found in the hospitality customs of ancient civilizations, especially where sandals were the chief footwear. A host would provide water for guests to wash their feet, provide a servant to wash the feet of the guests or even serve the guests by washing their feet. This is mentioned in several places in the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]] (e.g. [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|18:4|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|19:2|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|24:32|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|43:24|KJV}}; [[I Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Samuel|25:41|KJV}}; et al.), as well as other religious and historical documents. A typical Eastern host might bow, greet, and kiss his guest, then offer water to allow the guest to wash his feet or have servants do it. Though the wearing of sandals might necessitate washing the feet, the water was also offered as a courtesy even when shoes were worn.

[[I Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Samuel|25:41|KJV}} is the first biblical passage where an honored person offers to wash feet as a sign of humility. In John 12, [[Mary of Bethany]] anointed Jesus' feet presumably in gratitude for raising her brother [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead, and in preparation for his death and burial. The Bible records washing of the saint's feet being practised by the [[primitive church]] in [[I Timothy]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Timothy|5:10|KJV}} perhaps in reference to piety, submission and/or humility. There are several names for this practice: ''maundy'', ''foot washing'', ''washing the saints' feet'', ''pedilavium'', and ''mandatum''.

== Biblical reference ==
[[File:Washing of the Feet - Capella dei Scrovegni - Padua 2016.jpg|thumb|''Christ Reasoning with Peter'', by [[Giotto di Bondone]] (Cappella Scrovegni a Padova).]]

Christian denominations that observe foot washing do so on the basis of the authoritative example and command of [[Jesus]] as found in {{bibleverse|John|13:1–15|NKJV}} ([[New King James Version|NKJV]]):

{{quote|Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.}}

Jesus demonstrates the custom of the time when he comments on the lack of hospitality in one [[Pharisees]] home by not providing water to wash his feet in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:44:

{{quote|And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.}}

== History ==
The rite of foot washing finds its roots in scripture. Even after the [[Deaths of the Twelve Apostles|death of the apostles]] or the end of the [[Apostolic Age]], the practice was continued.

It appears to have been practiced in the [[Early Christianity|early centuries of post-apostolic Christianity]], though the evidence is scant. For example, [[Tertullian]] (145–220) mentions the practice in his ''De Corona'', but gives no details as to who practiced it or how it was practiced. It was practiced by the [[Early centers of Christianity#Milan|Church at Milan]] (c. 380), is mentioned by the ''[[Council of Elvira]]'' (300), and is even referenced by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (c. 400).

Observance of foot washing at the time of baptism was maintained in [[Africa]], [[Gaul]], [[Germany]], [[Milan]], northern [[Italy]], and [[Ireland]].

According to the ''Mennonite Encyclopedia'' "[[St. Benedict]]'s ''Rule'' (529) for the [[Benedictine Order]] prescribed hospitality feetwashing in addition to a communal feetwashing for humility"; a statement confirmed by the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].&lt;ref name="Washing of Hands and Feet"&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Washing of Feet and Hands}}&lt;/ref&gt; It apparently was established in the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Roman church]], though not in connection with baptism, by the 8th century.

The [[Albigenses]] observed footwashing in connection with communion, and the [[Waldensians|Waldenses]]' custom was to wash the feet of visiting ministers.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

There is some evidence that it was observed by the early [[Hussites]]; and the practice was a meaningful part of the 16th century [[radical reformation]]. Foot washing was often "rediscovered" or "restored" by Protestants in revivals of religion in which the participants tried to recreate the faith and practice of the [[apostolic era]] which they had abandoned or lost.

== Catholic practice ==
In [[Catholic Church]], the ritual washing of feet is now associated with the [[Mass of the Lord's Supper]], which celebrates in a special way the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus, before which he washed the feet of his [[twelve apostles]].

Evidence for the practice on this day goes back at least to the latter half of the 12th century, when "the pope washed the feet of twelve [[sub-deacon]]s after his Mass and of thirteen poor men after his dinner."&lt;ref name="Washing of Hands and Feet" /&gt;  From 1570 to 1955, the [[Roman Missal]] printed, after the text of the [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], a rite of washing of feet unconnected with the Mass.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} For many years [[Pius IX]] performed the foot washing in the sala over the portico of [[Saint Peter's, Rome]].{{sfn|Tuker|Malleson|1897|p=251}}

In 1955 [[Pope Pius XII]] revised the ritual and inserted it into the Mass. Since then, the rite is celebrated after the [[homily]] that follows the reading of the [[gospel]] account of how [[Jesus]] washed the feet of his twelve apostles ({{bibleverse||John|13:1–15|KJV}}). Some persons who have been selected&amp;nbsp;– usually twelve, but the Roman Missal does not specify the number&amp;nbsp;– are led to chairs prepared in a suitable place. The [[priest]] goes to each and, with the help of the ministers, pours water over each one's feet and dries them. There are some advocates of restricting this ritual to clergy or at least men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=3155 Washing of the Feet on Holy Thursday]. ''Catholic Online''. 29 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a notable break from the 1955 norms, [[Pope Francis]] washed the feet of two women and Muslims at a juvenile detention center in Rome 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/03/28/175601237/in-ritual-pope-francis-washes-the-feet-of-young-inmates-women] NPR, 28 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oswaldsobrino.com/2013/03/pope-foot-washing-of-females-yes-that.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408063002/http://www.oswaldsobrino.com/2013/03/pope-foot-washing-of-females-yes-that.html |archivedate=8 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Logos, 28 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it was announced that the [[Roman Missal]] had been revised to permit women to have their feet washed on [[Maundy Thursday]]; previously it permitted only males to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/21/world/pope-francis-women-ritual/ |title=Pope Francis changes foot-washing rite to include women |first=Daniel |last=Burke |date=21 January 2016 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Catholic priests around the world washed both women’s and men’s feet on Holy Thursday "their gesture of humility represented to many the progress of inclusion in the Catholic church."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/03/26/the-catholic-church-puts-one-foot-forward-on-the-path-to-including-women/ The Catholic Church puts one foot forward on the path to including women] The Washington Post, 26 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, most of the European monarchs also performed the Washing of Feet in their royal courts on [[Maundy Thursday]], a practice continued by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian Emperor]] and the [[King of Spain]] up to the beginning of the 20th century (see [[Royal Maundy]]).&lt;ref name="Washing of Hands and Feet" /&gt; In 1181 [[Roger de Moulins]], [[List of Princes and Grand Masters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] issued a statute declaring, "In Lent every Saturday, they are accustomed to celebrate maundy for thirteen poor persons, and to wash their feet, and to give to each a shirt and new breeches and new shoes, and to three chaplains, or to three clerics out of the thirteen, three deniers and to each of the others, two deniers".&lt;ref&gt;E.J. King, ''The Rule Statutes and Customs of the Hospitallers 1099–1310'' (London: Methuen, 1934), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eastern Christian practice ==
[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]]).]]

=== Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic ===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] practice the ritual of the Washing of Feet on [[Holy and Great Thursday]] (Maundy Thursday) according to their ancient rites. The service may be performed either by a [[bishop]], washing the feet of twelve priests; or by an [[Hegumen]] (Abbot) washing the feet of twelve members of the brotherhood of his [[monastery]].  The ceremony takes place at the end of the [[Divine Liturgy]].

After [[Holy Communion]], and before the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]], the brethren all go in [[procession]] to the place where the Washing of Feet is to take place (it may be in the center of the [[nave]], in the [[narthex]], or a location outside). After a psalm and some [[troparion|troparia]] (hymns) an [[ektenia]] (litany) is recited, and the bishop or abbot reads a prayer. Then the [[deacon]] reads the account in the Gospel of John, while the clergy perform the roles of Christ and his apostles as each action is chanted by the deacon. The deacon stops when the dialogue between Jesus and Peter begins. The senior-ranking clergyman among those whose feet are being washed speaks the words of Peter, and the bishop or abbot speaks the words of Jesus. Then the bishop or abbot himself concludes the reading of the Gospel, after which he says another prayer and sprinkles all of those present with the water that was used for the foot washing. The procession then returns to the church and the final dismissal is given as normal.

=== Oriental Orthodox ===
[[File:Bishop Sebouh - Washing of Feet.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] washing the feet of children.]]
Foot washing rites are also observed in the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches on Maundy Thursday.

In the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] the service is performed by the parish priest. He blesses the water for the foot washing with the cross, just as he would for blessing [[holy water]] and he washes the feet of the entire congregation.

In the Syrian Orthodox Church, this service is performed by a bishop or priest. There will be some 12 selected men, both priests and the lay people, and the bishop or priest will wash and kiss the feet of those 12 men. It is not merely a dramatization of the past event. Further it is a prayer where the whole congregation prays to wash and cleanse them of their sins.

== Protestant practice ==
[[File:Maundy Thursday 07 washing feet diocese St Asaph.jpg|thumb|Foot washing by the [[Bishop of St Asaph]], [[Church in Wales]], Maundy Thursday.]]

Foot washing is observed by numerous [[Protestant]] and [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] groups, including [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Pentecostal]], and [[Pietism|Pietistic]] groups, some [[Anabaptist]]s, and several types of [[Southern Baptists]].
Foot washing rites are also practiced by many [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]] and [[Methodist]] churches, whereby foot washing is most often experienced in connection with [[Maundy Thursday]] services and, sometimes, at ordination services where the [[Bishop]] may wash the feet of those who are to be ordained. Though history shows that foot washing has at times been practiced in connection with baptism, and at times as a separate occasion, by far its most common practice has been in connection with the [[The Lord's Supper|Lord's supper]] service.  The [[Moravian Church]] practiced Foot Washing until 1818.  There has been some revival of the practice as other liturgical churches have also rediscovered the practice.

[[File:ChristWashingFeet.JPG|left|thumb|''Christus'', by the Lutheran [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. This woodcut of {{bibleverse||John|13:14–17|KJV}} is from ''Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist''.]]

The observance of ''washing the saints' feet'' is quite varied, but a typical service follows the partaking of unleavened bread and wine.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Joseph (1876). ''The book of Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.'' Territory, Deseret News Office. p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Deacons (in many cases) place pans of water in front of pews that have been arranged for the service. The men and women participate in separate groups, men washing men's feet and women washing women's feet. Each member of the congregation takes a turn washing the feet of another member. Each foot is placed one at a time into the basin of water, is washed by cupping the hand and pouring water over the foot, and is dried with a long towel girded around the waist of the member performing the washing. Most of these services appear to be quite moving to the participants.

Among groups that do not observe foot washing as an ordinance or rite, the example of Jesus is usually held to be symbolic and didactic. Among these groups, foot washing is nevertheless sometimes literally practiced. First, some reserve it to be a practice of hospitality or a work of necessity. Secondly, some present it as a dramatic lesson acted out in front of the congregation.

=== Anabaptist practice ===
Groups descending from the 1708 [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], such as the [[Grace Brethren]], [[Church of the Brethren]], [[The Brethren Church|Brethren Church]], [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], and the [[Dunkard Brethren]] regularly practice foot washing (generally called "feetwashing"&lt;ref name="cob-practices"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Church of the Brethren|title=Brethren practices|url=http://www.brethren.org/about/practices.html|website=COB Website|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="for-all"&gt;{{cite book|title=For All Who Minister: A Worship Manual for the Church of the Brethren|date=1993|publisher=Brethren Press|location=Elgin, IL|pages=183–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Neglected Practice of Foot-washing|url=http://www.anabaptistnetwork.com/footwashing|website=The Anabaptist Network|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ramirez"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Frank|title=Learning to wash feet is theme of Brethren Journal Association luncheon|journal=Church of the Brethren Newsline|date=4 July 2014|url=http://www.brethren.org/news/2014/learning-to-wash-feet.html|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.mountainviewcob.org/about_us|website=Mountain View Church of the Brethren|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feetwashing in the Church of the Brethren|url=http://www.anabaptistnetwork.com/node/312|website=The Anabaptist Network|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=COB Youth Peace Travel Team 2012|title=Youth Peace Travel Team goes to National Young Adult Conference 2012!|url=http://blog.brethren.org/2012/youth-peace-travel-team-goes-to-national-young-adult-conference-2012/|website=Church of the Brethren Blog|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as one of three ordinances that compose their [[Lovefeast]], the others being the Eucharist and a fellowship meal.  Historically related groups such as the [[Amish]] and most [[Mennonite]]s also wash feet, tracing the practice to the 1632 [[Dordrecht Confession of Faith]]. For members, this practice promotes humility towards and care for others, resulting in a higher egalitarianism among members.

=== Baptist practice ===
[[File:Footwashing of Bro. Noah.JPG|thumb|The Friday Night Communion and Foot Washing Service at the Nolynn Association of Separate Baptist in Christ]]

Many Baptists observe the literal washing of feet as a third ordinance.  The communion and foot washing service is practiced regularly by members of the [[Separate Baptists in Christ]], [[General Association of Baptists]], [[Free Will Baptists]], [[Primitive Baptists]], [[Union Baptists]], [[Old Regular Baptist]], [[Christian Baptist Church of God]], and [[Brethren in Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bic-church.org/about/2008mdg.pdf Manual of Doctrine &amp; Government of the Brethren in Christ Church] (PDF). and Brethren in Christ Church.&lt;/ref&gt; Feet washing is also practiced as a third ordinance by many [[Southern Baptist]]s, [[General Baptist]]s, and [[Independent Baptist]]s.

In the mid-1830s, [[Joseph Smith]] introduced the original temple rites of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] in [[Kirtland, Ohio]], which primarily involved foot washing, followed by [[speaking in tongues]] and visions.&lt;ref name="Gruss255" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arrington, "Oliver Cowdery's Kirtland, Ohio, 'Sketch Book,'" ''BYU Studies,'' Summer 12 [1972]: 416–420; Cook and Backman, ''[http://www.boap.org/LDS/Early-Saints/Kirt-Elders.html Kirtland Elders' Quorum Record, 1836–1841]'' pp. 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buerger 2002"&gt;{{cite book | last=Buerger | first=David John | title=The Mysteries of Godliness: A History of Mormon Temple Worship | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Signature Books]] |year=2002 |origyear=1994 |isbn=978-1-56085-176-9 |oclc=52076971 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This foot washing took place exclusively among men, and was based upon the [[Old testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buerger |first=David John |title=The Development of the Mormon Temple Endowment Ceremony |work=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |volume=34 |issue=1/2 |date=2001 |p=78 |issn=0012-2157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{sfn|Buerger|2001|p=78}}--&gt; After Joseph Smith was initiated into the first three degrees of [[Freemasonry]], this was adapted into the whole body [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|"Endowment" ritual]] more similar to contemporary [[Mormon]] practice, which is nearly identical to [[Masonic temple]] rites, and does not specifically involve the feet.&lt;ref name="Gruss255"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gruss | first=E.C. | last2=Thuet | first2=L.A. | title=What Every Mormon (And Non-mormon) Should Know | publisher=XULON Press | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-60034-163-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgfHAlL2EncC&amp;pg=PA255 | accessdate=20 April 2017 | page=255}}&lt;!-- The footnotes here are not included in the Google Books preview.

In 1843, Smith included a foot washing element in the faith's [[second anointing]] ceremony in which elite married couples are anointed as heavenly monarchs and priests.{{sfn|Buerger|2002|p=24–26}}

The [[True Jesus Church]] includes footwashing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tjc.org/catLanding.aspx?tab=follow&amp;catno=follow06|title=Foot Washing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a scriptural sacrament based on {{bibleverse||John|13:1–11|KJV}}. Like the other two sacraments, namely Baptism and the Lord's Supper, members of the church believe that footwashing imparts salvific grace to the recipient—in this case, to have a part with Christ ({{bibleverse||John|13:8|KJV}}).

Most [[Church of God (disambiguation)|Church of God]] denominations also include footwashing in their [[Passover]] ceremony as instructed by Jesus in John 13:1–11.

Most [[Seventh-day Adventist]] congregations schedule an opportunity for foot washing preceding each quarterly (four times a year) Communion service. As with their "open" Communion, all believers in attendance, not just members or pastors, are invited to share in the washing of feet with another: men with men, women with women, and frequently, spouse with spouse. This service is alternatively called the Ordinance of Foot-Washing or the Ordinance of Humility. Its primary purpose is to renew the cleansing that only comes from Christ, but secondarily to seek and celebrate reconciliation with another member before Communion/the Lord's Supper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Progressive Judaism ==
A number of Jewish rabbis who disagree with the initiation custom of ''[[brit milah]]'', or circumcision of a male baby, instead have offered ''[[Brit shalom (naming ceremony)|brit shalom]]'', or a multi-part naming ceremony which eschews circumcision. One portion of the ritual, ''[[Brit rechitzah]]'', involves the washing of the baby's feet.

The '''Fraser Plateau and Basin Complex''' is an [[ecoregion]], as defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]]&lt;!--who cares?  WWF is not an NPOV source, nor authoritative--&gt;.  It encompasses the middle reaches of the watershed of the [[Fraser River]] as it traverses the northern part of the [[Interior Plateau]] of [[British Columbia]].  The WWF ecoregion is similar in description to  two of the ecoregions within [[Environment Canada|Environment Canada's]]  ''[[Montane Cordillera]] Ecozone:'' ''The Fraser Basin'' and the ''Fraser Plateau.'' Much of the Fraser Plateau is underlain by [[volcanic rock]]s which have steep [[escarpment]]s along [[river]]s and [[Stream|creeks]] and almost flat upper surfaces.

Physiographically, the Fraser Basin is a section of the larger Northern Plateaus province, which in turn is part of the larger [[Intermontane Plateaus]] physiographic division.

[[File:Artist's concept of collision at HD 172555.jpg|thumb|270px|Artist's depiction of a collision between two planetary bodies. Such an impact between Earth and a [[Theia (planet)|Mars-sized object]] likely formed the Moon.]]

The '''giant-impact hypothesis''', sometimes called the '''Big Splash''', or the '''Theia Impact''' suggests that the [[Moon]] formed out of the debris left over from a collision between Earth and an astronomical body the size of [[Mars]], approximately 4.5 billion years ago, in the [[Hadean]] eon; about 20 to 100 million years after the solar system coalesced.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140907"&gt;{{cite news |date=2014-09-09 |title=Revisiting the Moon |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/science/revisiting-the-moon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colliding body is sometimes called [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], from the name of [[Theia|the mythical Greek Titan]] who was the mother of [[Selene]], the goddess of the Moon.&lt;ref name=eapsl176/&gt;  Analysis of lunar rocks, published in a 2016 report, suggests that the impact may have been a direct hit, causing a thorough mixing of both parent bodies.&lt;ref name="YoungEtAl" /&gt;

The giant impact hypothesis is currently the favored [[scientific hypothesis]] for the formation of the Moon.&lt;ref name=nature412/&gt; Supporting evidence includes:

* Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit have similar orientations.&lt;ref name=mackenzie03/&gt;
* Moon samples indicate that [[Lunar magma ocean|the Moon's surface was once molten]].
* The Moon has a relatively small iron [[Planetary core|core]].
* The Moon has a lower density than Earth.
* There is evidence in other star systems of similar collisions, resulting in [[debris disk]]s.
* Giant collisions are consistent with the leading theories of the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|formation of the Solar System]].
* The stable-isotope ratios of lunar and terrestrial rock are identical, implying a common origin.&lt;ref name=wiechert/&gt;

However, there remain several questions concerning the best current models of the giant-impact hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | author = Daniel Clery | title = Impact Theory Gets Whacked | volume = 342 | page = 183 | date = 11 October 2013 | doi = 10.1126/science.342.6155.183|bibcode = 2013Sci...342..183C | pmid=24115419}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy of such a giant impact is predicted to have heated Earth to produce a global [[magma ocean]], and evidence of the resultant [[planetary differentiation]] of the heavier material sinking into Earth's mantle has been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444527486001401|title=Formation of Earth’s Core A2  - Schubert, Gerald|last=Rubie|first=D. C.|last2=Nimmo|first2=F.|last3=Melosh|first3=H. J.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780444527486|location=Amsterdam|pages=51–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{As of|2015|lc=y}} there is no self-consistent model that starts with the giant-impact event and follows the evolution of the debris into a single moon. Other remaining questions include when the Moon lost its share of [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile elements]] and why [[Venus]]—which experienced giant impacts during its formation—does not host a similar moon.

== History==
In 1898, [[George Darwin]] made the suggestion that the Earth and Moon were once a single body. Darwin's hypothesis was that a molten Moon had been spun from the Earth because of [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal forces]], and this became the dominant academic explanation.&lt;ref name="Binder 1974 53–76"/&gt; Using Newtonian mechanics, he calculated that the Moon had orbited much more closely in the past and was drifting away from the Earth. This drifting was later confirmed by [[Apollo program|American]] and [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Soviet]] experiments, using [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|laser ranging targets]] placed on the Moon.

Nonetheless, Darwin's calculations could not resolve the mechanics required to trace the Moon backward to the surface of the Earth. In 1946, [[Reginald Aldworth Daly]] of [[Harvard University]] challenged Darwin's explanation, adjusting it to postulate that the creation of the Moon was caused by an impact rather than centrifugal forces.&lt;ref name=dalypaps/&gt; Little attention was paid to Professor Daly's challenge until a conference on satellites in 1974, during which the idea was reintroduced and later published and discussed in ''[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]'' in 1975 by Drs. [[William Kenneth Hartmann|William K. Hartmann]] and [[Donald R. Davis]]. Their models suggested that, at the end of the planet formation period, several satellite-sized bodies had formed that could collide with the planets or be captured. They proposed that one of these objects may have collided with the Earth, ejecting refractory, volatile-poor dust that could coalesce to form the Moon. This collision could potentially explain the unique geological and geochemical properties of the Moon.&lt;ref name=icarus24_504/&gt;

A similar approach was taken by Canadian astronomer [[Alastair G. W. Cameron]] and American astronomer [[William R. Ward]], who suggested that the Moon was formed by the tangential impact upon Earth of a body the size of Mars. It is hypothesized that most of the outer silicates of the colliding body would be vaporized, whereas a metallic core would not. Hence, most of the collisional material sent into orbit would consist of silicates, leaving the coalescing Moon deficient in iron. The more volatile materials that were emitted during the collision probably would escape the Solar System, whereas silicates would tend to coalesce.&lt;ref name=alpc7_120/&gt;

=={{anchor|Theia}}Theia==
{{main|Theia (planet)}}
The name of the hypothesized [[protoplanet]] is derived from the mythical [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Titan (mythology)|titan]] [[Theia]] {{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|iː|ə}}, who gave birth to the Moon goddess [[Selene]]. This designation was proposed initially by the English geochemist [[Alexander Halliday|Alex N. Halliday]] in 2000 and has become accepted in the scientific community.&lt;ref name="eapsl176" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jrasc97_6_299" /&gt; According to modern theories of planet formation, Theia was part of a population of Mars-sized bodies that existed in the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago. One of the attractive features of the giant-impact hypothesis is that the formation of the Moon and Earth align; during the course of its formation, the Earth is thought to have experienced dozens of collisions with planet-sized bodies. The Moon-forming collision would have been only one such "giant impact" but certainly the last significant impactor event. The [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] by much smaller asteroids occurred later - approximately 3.9 billion years ago.

==Basic model==
[[File:Simple model.png|alt=|thumb|449x449px|Simplistic representation of the giant-impact hypothesis.]]
Astronomers think the collision between Earth and Theia happened at about 4.4 to 4.45 [[bya]]; about 0.1 billion years after the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System began to form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/23/how-old-is-the-moon-younger-research_n_3975109.html?ir=Science |title=How Old Is The Moon? 100 Million Years Younger Than Once Thought, New Research Suggests |publisher=The Huffington Post |first=David |last=Freeman |date=2013-09-23 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soderman_2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soderman|title=Evidence for Moon-Forming Impact Found Inside Meteorites|url=http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/evidence-for-moon-forming-impact-found-inside-meteorites/|publisher=NASA-SSERVI|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In astronomical terms, the impact would have been of moderate velocity. Theia is thought to have struck the Earth at an [[oblique angle]] when the Earth was nearly fully formed.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theia's iron [[Core (geology)|core]] would have sunk into the young Earth's core, and most of Theia's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] accreted onto the Earth's mantle. However, a significant portion of the mantle material from both Theia and the Earth would have been [[ejecta|ejected]] into orbit around the Earth (if ejected with velocities between [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] and [[escape velocity]]) or into individual orbits around the sun (if ejected at higher velocities). The material in orbits around the Earth quickly coalesced into the Moon (possibly within less than a month, but in no more than a century). The material in orbits around the sun stayed on its [[Kepler orbit]]s, which are stable in space, and was thus likely [[late heavy bombardment|to hit the earth-moon system]] sometime later (because the Earth-Moon system's Kepler orbit around the sun also remains stable). Estimates based on [[computer simulation]]s of such an event suggest that some twenty percent of the original mass of Theia would have ended up as an orbiting ring of debris around the Earth, and about half of this matter coalesced into the Moon.
The Earth would have gained significant amounts of [[angular momentum]] and [[mass]] from such a collision. Regardless of the speed and tilt of the Earth's rotation before the impact, it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact, and the Earth's equator and the Moon's orbit would have become [[Coplanarity|coplanar]].&lt;ref name=areps15/&gt;

Not all of the ring material need have been swept up right away: the thickened crust of the Moon's far side suggests the possibility that a second moon about 1,000&amp;nbsp; km in diameter formed in a [[Lagrange point]] of the Moon. The smaller moon may have remained in orbit for tens of millions of years.  As the two moons migrated outward from the Earth, solar tidal effects would have made the Lagrange orbit unstable, resulting in a slow-velocity collision that "pancaked" the smaller moon onto what is now the far side of the Moon, adding material to its crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Richard Lovett

== Composition ==
In 2001, a team at the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution of Washington]] reported that the rocks from the [[Apollo program]] carried an [[Isotopic_signature#Solar_system_origins|isotopic signature]] that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System.&lt;ref name=wiechert/&gt;

In 2014, a team in Germany reported that the Apollo samples had a slightly different isotopic signature from Earth rocks.&lt;ref name="Herwartz2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1251117| title = Identification of the giant impactor Theia in lunar rocks| journal = Science| volume = 344| issue = 6188| pages = 1146| year = 2014| last1 = Herwartz | first1 = D.| last2 = Pack | first2 = A.| last3 = Friedrichs | first3 = B.| last4 = Bischoff | first4 = A.|bibcode = 2014Sci...344.1146H | pmid=24904162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference was slight, but statistically significant. One possible explanation is that Theia formed near the Earth.&lt;ref name="Herwartz2014_BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27688511|publisher=BBC News |date=2014-06-06|title=Traces of another world found on the Moon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energetic aftermath theory ===
In 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology showed that the likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as the Earth was very small (less than 1 percent).&lt;ref name=ps2007/&gt; They proposed that in the aftermath of the giant impact, while the Earth and the proto-lunar disk were molten and vaporized, the two reservoirs were connected by a common silicate vapor atmosphere and that the Earth&amp;ndash; Moon system became homogenized by convective stirring while the system existed in the form of a continuous fluid. Such an "equilibration" between the post-impact Earth and the proto-lunar disk is the only proposed scenario that explains the isotopic similarities of the Apollo rocks with rocks from the Earth's interior. For this scenario to be viable, however, the proto-lunar disk would have to endure for about 100 years. Work is ongoing to determine whether or not this is possible.
 
=== Synestia model ===
Further modelling of the transient structure has given rise to the concept of a [[synestia]], a doughnut-shaped body that existed for a century before it cooled down and gave birth to the Earth and the moon.&lt;ref name="Boyle_2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyle|first1=Rebecca|title=Huge impact could have smashed early Earth into a doughnut shape|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2132763-huge-impact-could-have-smashed-early-earth-into-a-doughnut-shape|website=New Scientist|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lock_etal_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lock|first1=Simon J.|last2=Stewart|first2=Sarah T.|last3=Petaev|first3=Michail I.|last4=Leinhardt|first4=Zoe M.|last5=Mace|first5=Mia T.|last6=Jacobsen|first6=Stein B.|last7=Ćuk|first7=Matija|title=The origin of the Moon within a terrestrial synestia|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=2018|doi=10.1002/2017JE005333|arxiv=1802.10223|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JE005333/abstract|bibcode=2018JGRE..123..910L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence ==
Indirect evidence for the giant impact scenario comes from rocks collected during the [[Apollo Moon landing]]s, which show [[oxygen]] [[isotope]] ratios nearly identical to those of Earth. The highly [[anorthositic]] composition of the lunar crust, as well as the existence of [[KREEP]]-rich samples, suggest that a large portion of the Moon once was molten; and a giant impact scenario could easily have supplied the energy needed to form such a [[lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]]. Several lines of evidence show that if the Moon has an [[iron]]-rich core, it must be a small one. In particular, the mean density, moment of inertia, rotational signature, and magnetic induction response of the Moon all suggest that the radius of its core is less than about 25% the radius of the Moon, in contrast to about 50% for most of the other [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial]] bodies. Appropriate impact conditions satisfying the angular momentum constraints of the Earth&amp;ndash; Moon system yield a Moon formed mostly from the mantles of the Earth and the impactor, while the core of the impactor accretes to the Earth.&lt;ref name=nature412/&gt; It is noteworthy that the Earth has the highest density of all the planets in the Solar system; the absorption of the core of the impactor body explains this observation, given the proposed properties of the early Earth and Theia.

Comparison of the [[zinc]] isotopic composition of Lunar samples with that of Earth and [[Mars]] rocks provides further evidence for the impact hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Paniello2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paniello | first1 = R.

Moon rocks contain more heavy isotopes of zinc, and overall less zinc, than corresponding igneous Earth or Mars rocks, which is consistent with zinc being depleted from the Moon through evaporation, as expected for the giant impact origin.&lt;ref name="Paniello2012"/&gt;

Collisions between ejecta escaping Earth's gravity and asteroids would have left impact heating signatures in stony meteorites; analysis based on assuming the existence of this effect has been used to date the impact event to 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with the date obtained by other means.&lt;ref name = Bottke&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.aaa0602| title = Dating the Moon-forming impact event with asteroidal meteorites| journal = Science| volume = 348| issue = 6232| pages = 321| year = 2015| last1 = Bottke | first1 = W.

Warm silica-rich dust and abundant SiO gas, products of high velocity (&gt; 10&amp;nbsp; km/s) impacts between rocky bodies, have been detected by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] around the nearby (29 [[parsec|pc]] distant) young (~12 My old) star [[HD172555]] in the [[Beta Pictoris moving group]].&lt;ref name = apj701/&gt; A belt of warm dust in a zone between 0.25AU and 2AU from the young star [[HD 23514]] in the [[Pleiades]] cluster appears similar to the predicted results of Theia's collision with the embryonic Earth, and has been interpreted as the result of planet-sized objects colliding with each other.&lt;ref name=apj675/&gt; A similar belt of warm dust was detected around the star [[BD +20°307]] (HIP 8920, SAO 75016).&lt;ref name=nature436/&gt;

== Difficulties ==
This lunar origin hypothesis has some difficulties that have yet to be resolved. For example, the giant-impact hypothesis implies that a surface magma ocean would have formed following the impact. Yet there is no evidence that the Earth ever had such a magma ocean and it is likely there exists material that has never been processed in a magma ocean.&lt;ref name="4045.pdf"/&gt;

=== Composition ===
A number of compositional inconsistencies need to be addressed.

* The ratios of the Moon's volatile elements are not explained by the giant impact hypothesis. If the giant-impact hypothesis is correct, they must be due to some other cause.&lt;ref name="4045.pdf"/&gt;
* The presence of volatiles such as water trapped in lunar [[basalt]]s is more difficult to explain if the Moon was caused by a high-temperature impact.&lt;ref name=nature454/&gt;
* The iron oxide (FeO) content (13%) of the Moon, intermediate between that of Mars (18%) and the terrestrial mantle (8%), rules out most of the source of the proto-lunar material from the Earth's mantle.&lt;ref name=taylor07/&gt;
* If the bulk of the proto-lunar material had come from an impactor, the Moon should be enriched in [[Siderophile element|siderophilic]] elements, when, in fact, it is deficient in those.&lt;ref name=jess114/&gt;
* The Moon's oxygen isotopic ratios are essentially identical to those of Earth.&lt;ref name=wiechert/&gt; Oxygen isotopic ratios, which may be measured very precisely, yield a unique and distinct signature for each solar system body.&lt;ref name=scott010312/&gt; If a separate proto-planet [[Theia]] had existed, it probably would have had a different oxygen isotopic signature than Earth, as would the ejected mixed material.&lt;ref name=moonwalk/&gt;
* The Moon's [[titanium isotope]] ratio (&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;Ti/&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;Ti) appears so close to the Earth's (within 4 ppm), that little if any of the colliding body's mass could likely have been part of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The proto-Earth as a significant source of lunar material | journal = Nature Geoscience | date = 25 March 2012 | first = Junjun | last = Zhang |author2=Nicolas Dauphas |author3=Andrew M.

=== Lack of a Venusian moon ===
If the Moon was formed by such an impact, it is possible that other inner planets also may have been subjected to comparable impacts. A moon that formed around Venus by this process would have been unlikely to escape. If such a moon-forming event had occurred there, a possible explanation of why the planet does not have such a moon might be that a second collision occurred that countered the [[angular momentum]] from the first impact.&lt;ref name=baas38_491/&gt; Another possibility is that the strong tidal forces from the Sun would tend to destabilize the orbits of moons around close-in planets. For this reason, if Venus's slow rotation rate began early in its history, any satellites larger than a few kilometers in diameter would likely have spiraled inwards and collided with Venus.&lt;ref name=icarus202_1_12/&gt;

Simulations of the chaotic period of terrestrial planet formation suggest that impacts like those hypothesized to have formed the Moon were common. For typical terrestrial planets with a mass of 0.5 to 1 Earth masses, such an impact typically results in a single moon containing 4% of the host planet's mass. The inclination of the resulting moon's orbit is random, but this tilt affects the subsequent dynamic evolution of the system. For example, some orbits may cause the moon to spiral back into the planet. Likewise, the proximity of the planet to the star will also affect the orbital evolution. The net effect is that it is more likely for impact-generated moons to survive when they orbit more distant terrestrial planets and are aligned with the planetary orbit.&lt;ref name=lewis2011/&gt;

== Possible origin of Theia ==
[[Image: BigSplashEnglish.svg|thumb|One suggested pathway for the Big Splash as viewed from the direction of the south pole]]
In 2004, [[Princeton University]] mathematician [[Edward Belbruno]] and astrophysicist [[J. Richard Gott III]] proposed that Theia coalesced at the {{L4}} or {{L5}} [[Lagrangian point]] relative to Earth (in about the same orbit and about 60° ahead or behind),&lt;ref name=belbruno-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=mps40_1115/&gt; similar to a [[trojan asteroid]].&lt;ref name=mackenzie03/&gt; Two-dimensional computer models suggest that the stability of Theia's proposed [[Trojan (astronomy)|trojan orbit]] would have been affected when its growing mass exceeded a threshold of approximately 10% of the Earth's mass (the mass of Mars).&lt;ref name=belbruno-2005/&gt; In this scenario, gravitational perturbations by [[planetesimal]]s caused Theia to depart from its stable Lagrangian location, and subsequent interactions with proto-Earth led to a collision between the two bodies.&lt;ref name=belbruno-2005/&gt;

In 2008, evidence was presented that suggests that the collision may have occurred later than the accepted value of 4.53 [[Gya]], at approximately 4.48&amp;nbsp;Gya.&lt;ref name=halliday-2008/&gt; A 2014 comparison of computer simulations with elemental abundance measurements in the Earth's mantle indicated that the collision occurred approximately 95&amp;nbsp;My after the formation of the Solar System.&lt;ref name=jacobson-2014/&gt;

It has been suggested that other significant objects may have been created by the impact, which could have remained in orbit between the Earth and Moon, stuck in Lagrangian points. Such objects may have stayed within the Earth&amp;ndash;Moon system for as long as 100 million years, until the gravitational tugs of other planets destabilized the system enough to free the objects.&lt;ref name=ns080506/&gt; A study published in 2011 suggested that a subsequent collision between the Moon and one of these smaller bodies caused the notable differences in physical characteristics between the two hemispheres of the Moon.&lt;ref name=nature476_69/&gt; This collision, simulations have supported, would have been at a low enough velocity so as not to form a crater; instead, the material from the smaller body would have spread out across the Moon (in what would become its [[Far side of the Moon|far side]]), adding a thick layer of highlands crust.&lt;ref name=yahoo20110803/&gt; The resulting mass irregularities would subsequently produce a gravity gradient that resulted in [[tidal locking]] of the Moon so that today, only the near side remains visible from Earth. However, mapping by the [[Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory|GRAIL]] mission has apparently ruled out this scenario.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Modified hypothesis==
The giant-impact hypothesis fails to properly explain the similar composition of Earth and the Moon. Especially, the indistinguishable relation of oxygen isotopes cannot be explained by the classical form of this hypothesis. According to research on the subject that is based on new simulations at the [[University of Bern]] by physicist Andreas Reufer and his colleagues, Theia collided directly with Earth instead of barely swiping it. The collision speed may have been higher than originally assumed, and this higher velocity may have totally destroyed Theia. According to this modification, the composition of Theia is not so restricted, making a composition of up to 50% water ice possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/|title=Retuschen an der Entstehungsgeschichte des Erdtrabanten|first=Thorsten|last=Dambeck|date=11 September 2012|language=German|trans-title=Retouches on the genesis of Earth's moon|archiveurl=http://www.nzz.ch/wissen/wissenschaft/retuschen-an-der-entstehungsgeschichte-des-erdtrabanten-1.17592343|archivedate=11 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative hypotheses==
{{main|Origin of the Moon}}

Other mechanisms that have been suggested at various times for the Moon's origin are that the Moon was spun off from the Earth's molten surface by [[centrifugal force]];&lt;ref name="Binder 1974 53–76"/&gt; that it was formed elsewhere and was subsequently [[lunar capture|captured]] by the Earth's gravitational field;&lt;ref name=icarus24_256/&gt; or that the Earth and the Moon formed at the same time and place from the same [[accretion disk]]. None of these hypotheses can account for the high [[angular momentum]] of the Earth-Moon system.&lt;ref name=areps15/&gt;

Another hypothesis attributes the formation of the Moon to the impact of a large asteroid with the Earth much later than previously thought, creating the satellite primarily from debris from Earth. In this hypothesis, the formation of the Moon occurs 60–140 million years after the formation of the Solar System. Previously, the age of the Moon had been thought to be 4.527 ± 0.010 billion years.&lt;ref name=taylor1998/&gt; The impact in this scenario would have created a magma ocean on Earth and the proto-Moon with both bodies sharing a common plasma metal vapor atmosphere. The shared metal vapor bridge would have allowed material from the Earth and proto-Moon to exchange and equilibrate into a more common composition.&lt;ref name=nature450_1206/&gt;&lt;ref name=ngn20071219/&gt;

Yet another hypothesis proposes that the Moon and the Earth have formed together instead of separately like the giant-impact hypothesis suggests. The new model, developed by [[Robin M. Canup]], suggests that the Moon and the Earth have formed as a part of a massive collision of two planetary bodies, each larger than Mars, which then re-collided to form what we now call Earth. After the recollision, Earth was surrounded by a disk of material, which accreted to form the Moon. This hypothesis could explain facts that others do not.&lt;ref name=SimultaneousFormation/&gt;

[[File:Various types of Glow starter.jpg|thumb|Various types of glow starter]]
A '''glow switch starter''' is a type of preheat starter used with [[fluorescent lamps|fluorescent lamp]]. It is commonly filled with [[neon]] gas or [[argon]] gas and contains a [[bimetallic strip]] and a stationary electrode. The operating principle is simple, when current is applied, the gas inside ionizes and heats a bimetallic strip which in turn bends toward the stationary electrode thus shorting the starter between the electrodes of the [[fluorescent lamp]] After a second the starter's bimetallic strip will cool and open the circuit between the electrodes and the process repeats until the lamp has lit. One disadvantage of glow switch starters is that when the lamp is at the end of its life it will continuously blink on and off until the glow switch starter wears out or an [[electrode]] on the [[fluorescent lamp]] burns out.

The '''Indus Valley Desert''' is an almost uninhabited [[deserts and xeric shrublands|desert]] [[ecoregion]] of northern [[Pakistan]].

==Location and description==
The Indus Valley desert covers an area of {{convert|19,501|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} in northwestern [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab Province]] between the [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and [[Indus River|Indus]] rivers. The Indus Valley Desert is drier and less hospitable than the [[northwestern thorn scrub forests]] that surround it with temperatures ranging from freezing in winter to extremely hot (more than {{convert|45|°C|°F}}) in summer with only {{Convert|600|-|800|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of rainfall per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im1302|name=Indus Valley Desert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
[[File:Khejri.jpg|150 px|thumb|left|Shurbs found throughout this desert.]]
===Flora===
The desert vegetation is quite varied due to the variety of temperatures with [[Khejri]] shrubs being the characteristic species.
[[File:Striped Hyena Adult.jpg|150 px|thumb|right|Adult Striped hyena.]]
[[File:Indian Wolf Photo Dhaval Vargiya.jpg|150 px|thumb|Indian wolf roaming in desert.]]
[[File:Falco chicquera (Etosha, 2012).jpg|150 px|thumb|left|Red-necked falcon, one the bird species found in Indus Valley Desert.]]

===Fauna===
The desert is home to five large mammals: [[Indian wolf]], [[striped hyena]], [[caracal]], [[Indian leopard]] and the [[urial]] (''Ovis orientalis punjabensis'') along with many rodents and other mammals. Meanwhile, the 190 species of bird in the desert include the [[red-necked falcon]].

==Threats and preservation==
Like the nearby [[Thar Desert]] the Indus Valley desert has little farming or grazing due to its hard climate and therefore the natural habitats are almost intact. However hunting still goes on and is a threat to caracals, wolves and other mammals.

The '''Irish Social Season''' was a period of aristocratic entertainment and social functions that stretched from January to [[St. Patrick's Day]] of a given year. During this period, the major and minor nobility left their country residences and lived in Georgian mansions in places like Rutland Square (now Parnell Square), [[Mountjoy Square]], [[Merrion Square]] and [[Fitzwilliam Square]] in [[Dublin]]. Those with less financial means lived in (or in some cases rented) smaller properties in streets nearby.

The focal point of the Social Season was the move of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] (the King's representative) from his 'out of season' residence, the [[Áras an Uachtaráin|Viceregal Lodge]] (now Áras an Uachtaráin, the residence of the [[President of Ireland]]) to live in state in the Viceregal Apartments in [[Dublin Castle]], where he and his wife hosted a series of levées, drawing rooms, banquets and balls in the Castle. 

The period of the social season also coincided with the parliamentary sessions of the Irish House of Lords, which many of the peers in Dublin would be attending. However the Irish Parliament was abolished with the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] which merged the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. 

With the abolition of the lord lieutenancy in 1922, the emergence of a new nationalist state (the [[Irish Free State]]) the same year, and the economic and social downturn that resulted from [[World War I]], the Social Season dwindled and then died. Most of the aristocratic homes in Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square were sold and are now used as corporate offices. 

Among the Irish peers who would reside in Dublin during the 'Social Season' were

*Duke of Leinster ''(Ireland's senior peer)''
*Marquess of Slane
*Duke of Ormonde
*Lord Powerscourt
*Earl of Fingall
*Earl of Headfort

'''James Watt''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRS|FRSE}} ({{IPAc-en|w|ɒ|t}}; 30 January 1736 &lt;small&gt;(19 January 1736 [[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]])&lt;/small&gt; – 25 August 1819)&lt;ref name=deathdate/&gt; was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[invention|inventor]], mechanical engineer, and [[chemist]] who improved on [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s 1712 [[Newcomen steam engine]] with his [[Watt steam engine]] in 1776, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the [[Industrial Revolution]] in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world.

While working as an instrument maker at the [[University of Glasgow]], Watt became interested in the technology of [[steam engine]]s. He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]. Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines.  Eventually he [[rotative beam engine|adapted his engine]] to produce rotary motion, greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water.

Watt attempted to commercialise his invention, but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with [[Matthew Boulton]] in 1775. The new firm of [[Boulton and Watt]] was eventually highly successful and Watt became a wealthy man. In his retirement, Watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work. He died in 1819 aged 83.

He developed the concept of [[horsepower]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egr.msu.edu/~lira/supp/steam/wattbio.html|title=Biography of James Watt|last=Lira|first=Carl|year=2001|publisher=egr.msu.edu|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SI]] unit of power, the [[watt]], was named after him.

Andrew Carnegie has written a life of him and describes him as a deist who never went to church.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watt did not attend school regularly; initially he was mostly [[schooled at home]] by his mother but later he attended Greenock Grammar School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=28880|title=Watt, James (1736–1819)|origyear=2004|year=2013|last=Tann|first=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He exhibited great manual dexterity, engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics, while [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] failed to interest him.

When he was eighteen, his mother died and his father's health began to fail. Watt travelled to London to study [[measuring instrument|instrument]]-making for a year, then returned to Scotland, settling in the major commercial city of [[Glasgow]] intent on setting up his own instrument-making business. He made and repaired brass [[octant (instrument)|reflecting quadrants]], [[parallel rulers]], scales, parts for telescopes, and barometers, among other things. Because he had not served at least seven years as an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]], the Glasgow [[Guild]] of Hammermen (which had jurisdiction over any [[artisan]]s using [[hammer]]s) blocked his application,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Henry|last2=Thomas|first2=Dana Lee|title=Living adventures in science|year=1954|publisher=Ayer Publishing|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carnegie|first1=Andrew|title=James Watt|date=1905|publisher=Oliphant, Anderson &amp; Ferrier|location=Edinburgh and London|page=18|url=https://archive.org/stream/jameswatt00carniala#page/18/mode/2up|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from Jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by Alexander Macfarlane to the [[University of Glasgow]], instruments that required expert attention.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1925) Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Watt restored them to working order and was remunerated. These instruments were eventually installed in the [[Macfarlane Observatory]]. Subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university. It was initiated in 1757 and two of the professors, the [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] [[Joseph Black]] as well as the famed [[Adam Smith]], became Watt's friends.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

At first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university, helping with demonstrations, and expanding the production of [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrants]]. In 1759 he formed a partnership with John Craig, an architect and businessman, to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys. This partnership lasted for the next six years, and employed up to sixteen workers. Craig died in 1765. One employee, Alex Gardner, eventually took over the business, which lasted into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol I, pp. 103–15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1764, Watt married his cousin Margaret (Peggy) Miller, with whom he had five children, two of whom lived to adulthood: [[James Watt Jr.|James Jr.]] (1769–1848) and Margaret (1767–1796). His wife died in childbirth in 1772. In 1777 he was married again, to Ann MacGregor, daughter of a Glasgow dye-maker, with whom he had two children: Gregory (1777–1804), who became a geologist and mineralogist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Torrens | first1 = H.

Ann died in 1832. Between 1777 and 1790 he lived in Regent Place, Birmingham.

===Watt and the kettle===

There is a popular story that Watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling, the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing Watt the power of steam. This story is told in many forms; in some Watt is a young lad, in others he is older, sometimes it's his mother's kettle, sometimes his aunt's. James Watt of course did not actually ''invent'' the steam engine, as the story implies, but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing Newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser. This is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency. It appears that the story of Watt and the kettle was created, possibly by Watt's son James Watt Jr., and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=True Myths: James Watt's Kettle, His Condenser, and His Chemistry |last=Miller |first=D. P. |journal=[[History of Science (journal)|History of Science]] |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=333–360 [p. 334] |doi=10.1177/007327530404200304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this light it can be seen as akin to the story of [[Isaac Newton]], the falling apple and his discovery of gravity.

Although it is often dismissed as a myth, like most good stories the story of James Watt and the kettle has a basis in fact. In trying to understand the [[thermodynamics]] of heat and steam James Watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution |first=A. E. |last=Musson |first2=Eric |last2=Robinson |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1969 |page=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early experiments with steam===
[[File:James Eckford Lauder - James Watt and the Steam Engine- the Dawn of the Nineteenth Century - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Eckford Lauder]]: ''James Watt and the Steam Engine: the Dawn of the Nineteenth Century'', 1855]]
[[File:Watts First Condenser.jpg|thumb|[[Watt's separate condenser|Original condenser]] by Watt ([[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]])]]

In 1759 Watt's friend, [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]], called his attention to the use of steam as a source of [[motive power]].&lt;ref name="Muirhead1858"&gt;{{cite book|last=Muirhead|first=James Patrick|title=The life of James Watt: with selections from his correspondence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_b8GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=17 August 2011|year=1858|publisher=J. Murray|pages=74–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the [[Newcomen engine]], in use for almost 50 years for pumping water from mines, had hardly changed from its first implementation.  Watt began to experiment with steam, though he had never seen an operating steam engine.  He tried constructing a model; it failed to work satisfactorily, but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject. He came to realise the importance of [[latent heat]]—the [[thermal energy]] released or absorbed during a constant-temperature process—in understanding the engine, which, unknown to Watt, his friend Joseph Black had previously discovered some years before. Understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state, for the science of [[thermodynamics]] would not be formalised for nearly another 100 years.

In 1763, Watt was asked to repair a model Newcomen engine belonging to the university.&lt;ref name="Muirhead1858"/&gt; Even after repair, the engine barely worked. After much experimentation, Watt demonstrated that about three-quarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the [[Cylinder (engine)|engine cylinder]] on every cycle.&lt;ref name="FrazerPa1859"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazer|first=Persifor|title=Journal of the Franklin Institute|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3oqAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA296|accessdate=17 August 2011|year=1859|pages=296–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; This energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure. Thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder, the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into [[mechanical energy]].

Watt's critical insight, arrived at in May 1765,&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; was to cause the steam to [[condense]] in a separate chamber apart from the [[piston]], and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a "steam jacket."&lt;ref name="FrazerPa1859"/&gt; Thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle, making more available to perform useful work. Watt had a working model later that same year.

[[File:James Watt steam engine relic at the Carron Works.JPG|thumb|[[Cylinder (engine)|Cylinder]] fragment of Watt's first operational engine at the [[Carron Works]], Falkirk]]

Despite a potentially workable design, there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a full-scale engine. This required more capital, some of which came from Black. More substantial backing came from [[John Roebuck]], the founder of the celebrated [[Carron Iron Works]] near [[Falkirk]], with whom he now formed a partnership. Roebuck lived at [[Kinneil House]] in [[Bo'ness]], during which time Watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salmon|first1=Thomas James|title=Borrowstounness and district, being historical sketches of Kinneil, Carriden, and Bo'ness, c. 1550–1850|date=1913|publisher=William Hodge and Co.|location=Edinburgh|pages=372–376|url=https://archive.org/stream/borrowstounnessd00salmrich#page/270/mode/2up|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shell of the cottage, and a very large part of one of his projects, still exist to the rear.&lt;ref&gt;"James Watt's Cottage", CANMORE. Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. Retrieved 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder. [[Iron (material)|Iron]] workers of the day were more like [[blacksmith]]s than modern machinists, and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision. Much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on Watt's invention. Strapped for resources, Watt was forced to take up employment—first as a [[surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]], then as a civil engineer—for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol I, pages 180–293&lt;/ref&gt;

Roebuck went bankrupt, and [[Matthew Boulton]], who owned the [[Soho Manufactory]] works near [[Birmingham]], acquired his patent rights. An extension of the patent to 1800 was successfully obtained in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;James Watt's Fire Engines Patent Act, 1775 (15 Geo 3 c. 61). At the time, an [[Act of Parliament]] was required to obtain a patent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Boulton, Watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world. The difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]], who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at [[Bersham Ironworks|Bersham]], near [[Wrexham]], [[North Wales]]. Watt and Boulton formed a hugely successful partnership, [[Boulton and Watt]], which lasted for the next twenty-five years.

===First engines===
[[File:SteamEngine Boulton&amp;Watt 1784.png|thumb|left|Engraving of a 1784 [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]] designed by [[Boulton and Watt]].]]
{{Main|Watt steam engine|Watt's linkage|Watt's curve}}
In 1776, the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises. These first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft. The design was commercially successful, and for the next five years Watt was very busy installing more engines, mostly in [[Cornwall]] for pumping water out of mines.

These early engines were not manufactured by Boulton and Watt, but were made by others according to drawings made by Watt, who served in the role of consulting engineer. The erection of the engine and its [[shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] was supervised by Watt, at first, and then by men in the firm's employ. These were large machines. The first, for example, had a cylinder with a diameter of some 50&amp;nbsp;inches and an overall height of about 24 feet, and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it. Boulton and Watt charged an annual payment, equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a Newcomen engine performing the same work.

The field of application for the invention was greatly widened when Boulton urged Watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding, weaving and milling. Although a [[crank (mechanism)|crank]] seemed the obvious solution to the conversion Watt and Boulton were stymied by a patent for this, whose holder, [[James Pickard]], and associates proposed to cross-license the external condenser. Watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their [[sun and planet gear]] in 1781.

Over the next six years, he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine. A double acting engine, in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one. He described methods for working the steam "expansively" (i.e., using steam at pressures well above atmospheric). A compound engine, which connected two or more engines was described. Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782. Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented. One of these included the use of the steam [[indicator diagram|indicator]] which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a [[trade secret]]. Another important invention, one which Watt was most proud of, was the [[parallel motion]] which was essential in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump, from the connected rocking beam, whose end moves in a [[circular arc]]. This was patented in 1784. A throttle valve to control the power of the engine, and a [[centrifugal governor]], patented in 1788,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Richard|title=Society and Economy in Modern Britain 1700–1850|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1991|page=60|isbn=978-0-203-40252-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to keep it from "running away" were very important. These improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the Newcomen engine.

Because of the danger of exploding [[boilers]], which were in a very primitive stage of development, and the ongoing issues with leaks, Watt restricted his use of high pressure steam&amp;nbsp;– all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure.

===Patent trials===
[[File:20070616 Dampfmaschine.jpg|thumb|A steam engine built to James Watt's patent in 1848 at [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] in Germany]]
[[Edward Bull]] started constructing engines for Boulton and Watt in Cornwall in 1781. By 1792 he had started making engines of his own design, but which contained a separate condenser, and so infringed Watt's patents. Two brothers, [[Jabez Carter Hornblower]] and [[Jonathan Hornblower]] Jnr also started to build engines about the same time. Others began to modify Newcomen engines by adding a condenser, and the mine owners in Cornwall became convinced that Watt's patent could not be enforced. They started to withhold payments due to Boulton and Watt, which by 1795 had fallen. Of the total £21,000 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|21000|1795|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}} as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}) owed, only £2,500 had been received. Watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol 3, ch 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt;

He first sued Bull in 1793. The jury found for Watt, but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial. In the meantime, injunctions were issued against the infringers, forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow. The trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive, but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers, except for Jonathan Hornblower, all began to settle their cases. Hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges (in 1799) was decisively in favour of Watt. Their friend John Wilkinson, who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder, was a particularly grievous case. He had erected about twenty engines without Boulton's and Watts' knowledge. They finally agreed to settle the infringement in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;Roll p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Boulton and Watt never collected all that was owed them, but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration. These trials were extremely costly in both money and time, but ultimately were successful for the firm.

===Copying machine===
[[File:Portable Copying Machine by James Watt &amp; Co.jpg|thumb|Portable Copying Machine by James Watt &amp; Co. Circa 1795]]
Before 1780 there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings. The only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens.  Watt at first experimented with improving this method, but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome.  He instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet, moistened with a solvent, and pressed to the original. The second sheet had to be thin, so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light, thus reproducing the original exactly.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Vol, 2, pp. 190–211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.B. Proudfoot, Origin of Stencil Duplicating, p. 21, as quoted at Quaritch.com 12 Oct 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Watt started to develop the process in 1779, and made many experiments to formulate the ink, select the thin paper, to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper, and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer. All of these required much experimentation, but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later. Watt formed another partnership with Boulton (who provided financing) and [[James Keir]] (to manage the business) in a firm called James Watt and Co. The perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others, but this was carried out over the next few years. Boulton and Watt gave up their shares to their sons in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Hills vol. 3 p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; It became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century.

===Chemical experiments===
From an early age Watt was very interested in chemistry. In late 1786, while in Paris, he witnessed an experiment by [[Berthollet]] in which he reacted [[hydrochloric acid]] with [[manganese dioxide]] to produce [[chlorine]]. He had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles, and had published his findings, which aroused great interest among many potential rivals. When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process.  He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and [[sulphuric acid]] could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method. He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali, and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties. He soon communicated these results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, who was a bleacher in Glasgow. Otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol 3, ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;

With McGrigor and his wife Annie, he started to scale up the process, and in March 1788, McGrigor was able to bleach 1500 yards of cloth to his satisfaction. About this time Berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process, and published it so it became public knowledge. Many others began to experiment with improving the process, which still had many shortcomings, not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product. Watt's rivals soon overtook him in developing the process, and he dropped out of the race. It was not until 1799, when [[Charles Tennant]] patented a process for producing solid [[bleaching powder]] (calcium hypochlorite) that it became a commercial success.

By 1794 Watt had been chosen by [[Thomas Beddoes]] to manufacture apparatus to produce, clean and store gases for use in the new [[Pneumatic Institution]] at [[Hotwells]] in Bristol. Watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years, but by 1797 the medical uses for the "factitious airs" had come to a dead end.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol 3, pp. 152–58&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Watt apparatus 3.JPG|thumb|Scientific apparatus designed by [[Boulton and Watt]] in preparation of the [[Pneumatic Institution]] in Bristol]]

===Personality===
Watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically. [[Humphry Davy]] said of him "Those who consider James Watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character; he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist, and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences, and that peculiar characteristic of genius, the union of them for practical application".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnegie|first=Andrew|title=James Watt|url=http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/carnegie/ch10.html|year=1905|publisher=Doubleday, Page and Company|chapter=10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708035219/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/carnegie/ch10.html|archivedate=8 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was greatly respected by other prominent men of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, chap. XI: ''Watt, the Man''&lt;/ref&gt; He was an important member of the [[Lunar Society]], and was a much sought-after conversationalist and companion, always interested in expanding his horizons.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol I, pages 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; His personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and long-lasting.

Watt was a prolific correspondent. During his years in [[Cornwall]], he wrote long letters to Boulton several times per week. He was averse to publishing his results in, for example, the [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] however, and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in [[patents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Smiles| first=Samuel| title=Lives of Boulton and Watt: A History of the Invention and Introduction of the Steam Engine| URL=https://archive.org/stream/livesofengineers04smiluoft#page/286/mode/2up | publisher=John Murray| place=London| year=1865 | page=286| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an excellent [[Drafter|draughtsman]].

[[File:James Watt's letters from the Science Museum Library &amp; Archives in Wroughton.jpg|thumb|James Watt's letters from the [[Science Museum at Wroughton|Science Museum Library &amp; Archives in Wroughton]]]]

He was a rather poor businessman, and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine. In a letter to [[William Small]] in 1772, Watt confessed that "he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain."&lt;ref&gt;Roll, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Until he retired, he was always much concerned about his financial affairs, and was something of a worrier. His health was often poor. He was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression.

===Soho Foundry===
At first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines, and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property. They produced almost none of the parts themselves. Watt did most of his work at his home in Harper's Hill in Birmingham, while Boulton worked at the [[Soho Manufactory]]. Gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts, and by 1795 they purchased a property about a mile away from the Soho manufactory, on the banks of the [[BCN Main Line|Birmingham Canal]], to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines. The [[Soho Foundry]] formally opened in 1796 at a time when Watt's sons, Gregory and [[James Watt Jr.|James Jr.]] were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise. In 1800, the year of Watt's retirement, the firm made a total of forty-one engines.&lt;ref&gt;Roll, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Heathfield Hall, Handsworth by Allen Edward Everitt.jpg|thumb|An 1835 painting of "[[Heathfield Hall|Heathfield]]", Watt's house in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]], by [[Allen Edward Everitt]] ]]
[[File:James Watt's Workshop.jpg|thumb|upright|James Watt's workshop]]
Watt retired in 1800, the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with [[Matthew Boulton|Boulton]] expired. The famous partnership was transferred to the men's sons, [[Matthew Robinson Boulton]] and [[James Watt Jr.]] . Longtime firm engineer [[William Murdoch]] was soon made a partner and the firm prospered.

Watt continued to invent other things before and during his semi-retirement. Within his home in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]], Staffordshire, Watt made use of a garret room as a workshop, and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson ch VII&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well, but which he never patented.&lt;ref&gt;Hills vol 3, pp. 234–37&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend [[Adam Smith]]. He maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects. He proposed, for example, a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] at Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, vol 3, pp. 230–31&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his second wife travelled to France and Germany, and he purchased an estate in mid-Wales at Doldowlod House, one mile south of [[Llanwrthwl]], which he much improved.

In 1816 he took a trip on the paddle-steamer ''[[PS Comet|Comet]]'', a product of his inventions, to revisit his home town of Greenock.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chambers' Book of Days&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 25 August 1819 at his home "[[Heathfield Hall|Heathfield]]" in Handsworth, [[Staffordshire]] (now part of [[Birmingham]]) at the age of 83. He was buried on 2 September in the graveyard of [[St Mary's Church, Handsworth]]. The church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church.

==Murdoch's contributions==
William Murdoch joined Boulton and Watt in 1777.  At first he worked in the pattern shop in Soho, but soon he was erecting engines in Cornwall.  He became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success.  A very able man, he made several important inventions on his own.

John Griffiths, who wrote a biography&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths; ''The Third Man, The Life and Times of William Murdoch 1754–1839'' Illustrated with Black-and-white photographic plates and diagrams with Bibliography and Index; Andre Deutsch; 1992; {{ISBN|0-233-98778-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; of him in 1992, has argued that Watt's discouraging Murdoch from working with high pressure steam (Watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe) on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jarvis|first=Adrian|title=Samuel Smiles and the construction of Victorian values|year=1997|publisher=Sutton|isbn=978-0-7509-1128-3|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watt patented the application of the [[sun and planet gear]] to steam in 1781 and a [[steam locomotive]] in 1784, both of which have strong claims to have been invented by Murdoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Lance|last2=McNeil|first2=Ian|title=Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FrGwIIvKSxUC&amp;lpg=PA878&amp;pg=PA878#v=onepage&amp;q|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-02829-2|page=878}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent was never contested by Murdoch, however, and Boulton and Watt's firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines, even long after the patent for the crank expired in 1794.  Murdoch was made a partner of the firm in 1810, where he remained until his retirement 20 years later at the age of 76.

{{further|Industrial revolution}}

James Watt's improvements to the steam engine "converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the Industrial Revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Anthony|date=3 December 1981|title=Review: James Watt and the steam engine|journal=New Scientist|page=685|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FPxItYa5rgUC&amp;lpg=PA685&amp;dq=james-watt%20%22industrial%20revolution%22&amp;pg=PA685#v=onepage&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of efficient, reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable, and altered the economies of continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prasad|first=B.

Of Watt, the English novelist [[Aldous Huxley]] (1894–1963) wrote; "To us, the moment 8:17 A.M. means something&amp;nbsp;– something very important, if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train. To our ancestors, such an odd eccentric instant was without significance&amp;nbsp;– did not even exist. In inventing the locomotive, Watt and Stephenson were part inventors of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Patrick|date=5 July 1973|title=The last word on...

==Honours==
Watt was much honoured in his own time.  In 1784 he was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], and was elected as a member of the [[Batavian Society for Experimental Philosophy]], of [[Rotterdam]] in 1787.  In 1789 he was elected to the elite group, the [[Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Watson | first = Garth | title = The Smeatonians: The Society of Civil Engineers  | publisher=Thomas Telford | year = 1989 | url = | id = | isbn = 0-7277-1526-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806 he was conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws by the [[University of Glasgow]].  The [[French Academy]] elected him a Corresponding Member and he was made a Foreign Associate in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, pp. 197–98&lt;/ref&gt;

The watt is named after James Watt for his contributions to the development of the [[steam engine]], and was adopted by the Second Congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1889 and by the 11th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1960 as the unit of [[Power (physics)|power]] incorporated in the [[International System of Units]] (or "SI").

On 29 May 2009 the [[Bank of England]] announced that Boulton and Watt would appear on a new [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|£50 note]]. The design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a Bank of England note, and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of Watt's steam engine and Boulton's Soho Manufactory. Quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note: "I sell here, sir, what all the world desires to have—POWER" (Boulton) and "I can think of nothing else but this machine" (Watt). The inclusion of Watt is the second time that a Scot has featured on a Bank of England note (the first was [[Adam Smith]] on the 2007 issue £20 note).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8075130.stm|title=Steam giants on new £50 banknote|publisher=BBC|date= 30 May 2009|accessdate= 22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011 it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on 2 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/30/bank-england-new-50-pound-note?newsfeed=true|title=Bank of England to launch new £50 note|author=Heather Stewart|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the [[Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engineeringhalloffame.org/index.html |title=Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame |work=''engineeringhalloffame.org'' |year=2012 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
[[File:James Watt Memorial College.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[James Watt College|James Watt Memorial College]] in [[Greenock]].]]

Watt was buried in the grounds of [[St. Mary's Church, Handsworth]], in Birmingham. Later expansion of the church, over his grave, means that his tomb is now buried ''inside'' the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=E.R|title=The Post Office Directory of Birmingham|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dO8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=%22james+watt%22+buried+handsworth+chapel&amp;q=%22james%20watt%22%20buried%20handsworth%20chapel|year=1878|publisher=Kelly and co.|location=London|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[attic|garret]] room workshop that Watt used in his retirement was left, locked and untouched, until 1853, when it was first viewed by his biographer [[James Patrick Muirhead|J. P. Muirhead]]. Thereafter, it was occasionally visited, but left untouched, as a kind of shrine. A proposal to have it transferred to the Patent Office came to nothing. When the house was due to be demolished in 1924, the room and all its contents were presented to the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]], where it was recreated in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/the_age_of_the_engineer/03.ST.03/?scene=5&amp;tv=true |title=Garret workshop of James Watt |publisher=Makingthemodernworld.org.uk |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained on display for visitors for many years, but was walled-off when the gallery it was housed in closed. The workshop remained intact, and preserved, and in March 2011 was put on public display as part of a new permanent Science Museum exhibition, "James Watt and our world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Watt's legendary 'magical retreat' to be revealed at Science Museum |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/press_and_media/press_releases/2011/03/watt.aspx |work=(Press Release) |publisher=[[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] |accessdate=25 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xRvOFm3B?url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/press_and_media/press_releases/2011/03/watt.aspx |archivedate=25 March 2011 |date=1 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approximate location of James Watt's birth in Greenock is commemorated by a statue. Several locations and street names in Greenock recall him, most notably the Watt Memorial Library, which was begun in 1816 with Watt's donation of scientific books, and developed as part of the Watt Institution by his son (which ultimately became the [[James Watt College]]). Taken over by the local authority in 1974, the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of [[Inverclyde]], and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule. Watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in [[George Square]], Glasgow and [[Princes Street]], Edinburgh, as well as several others in [[Birmingham]], where he is also remembered by the [[Lunar Society Moonstones|Moonstones]] and a school is named in his honour.

The James Watt College has expanded from its original location to include campuses in [[Kilwinning]] (North Ayrshire), Finnart Street and The Waterfront in Greenock, and the Sports campus in [[Largs]]. [[Heriot-Watt University]] near [[Edinburgh]] was at one time the School of Arts of Edinburgh, founded in 1821 as the world's first [[Mechanics Institute]], but to commemorate George Heriot, the 16th-century financier to King James, and James Watt, after Royal Charter the name was changed to Heriot-Watt University. Dozens of university and college buildings (chiefly of science and technology) are named after him. Matthew Boulton's home, [[Soho House]], is now a museum, commemorating the work of both men. The [[University of Glasgow]]'s Faculty of Engineering has its headquarters in the James Watt Building, which also houses the department of Mechanical Engineering and the department of Aerospace Engineering.
The huge painting ''James Watt contemplating the steam engine'' by [[James Eckford Lauder]] is now owned by the [[National Gallery of Scotland]].

[[File:Watt James Chantrey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Francis Legatt Chantrey|Chantrey]]'s statue of James Watt]]

There is a statue of James Watt in [[Piccadilly Gardens]], Manchester and [[City Square, Leeds]].

A colossal statue of Watt by [[Francis Legatt Chantrey|Chantrey]] was placed in [[Westminster Abbey]], and later was moved to [[St. Paul's Cathedral]].  On the [[cenotaph]] the inscription reads, in part, "JAMES WATT ... ENLARGED THE RESOURCES OF HIS COUNTRY, INCREASED THE POWER OF MAN, AND ROSE TO AN EMINENT PLACE AMONG THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS FOLLOWERS OF SCIENCE AND THE REAL BENEFACTORS OF THE WORLD."

A bust of Watt is in the Hall of Heroes of the [[National Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]].

'''Johan Eberhard von Schantz''' ({{lang-ru|Иван Иванович фон Шанц}}), born 29 October 1802 in [[Pori]], died 3 January 1880 in [[St. Petersburg]], was a Finnish-born [[admiral]] in the [[Russian Imperial Navy]], [[Ship designers of Russia|ship designer]] and [[explorer]].

== Life ==
Schantz was born in the [[Satakunta (historical province)|Western Finnish]] coastal town of Pori, which at the time was a part of [[Sweden]], as the son of the lieutenant general Johan Eberhard von Schantz and Johanna Sofia Didron. In 1814 he enlisted the Russian merchant navy and later took [[chief mate]] classes in [[Vyborg]]. Schantz served 1821–1828 as a [[midshipman]] in the 26th naval equipage of the [[Baltic Fleet]], 1828–1830 as a lieutenant in the 8th naval equipage, 1830–1832 in the 27th naval equipage and 1832 in the 5th naval equipage. During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29]] Schantz served in the [[ship of the line]] ''Fère Champenoise'' which took part of the blockade of the [[Dardanelles]]. 1833–1838 he was the adjutant of the admiral [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov]].

1834–1836 Schantz circumnavigated the globe as the commander of the Russian Imperial Navy ship ''America''. In 1835 he rediscovered the [[Wotho Atoll]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micsem.org/pubs/articles/historical/forships/marshalls.htm MARSHALLS] Foreign Ships in Micronesia. Retrieved 6 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; originally discovered by the Spanish expedition of [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] in the 1540s. The atoll was later also known as ''Schantz Islands''.

1841 Schantz sailed the frigate ''[[Russian frigate Kamchatka (1841)|Kamchatka]]'' from [[New York City]] to [[Kronstadt]] and commanded the ship until 1847. He was promoted to [[counter admiral]] in 1848. In the 1850s Schantz designed several [[gunboat]]s built in the Finnish docks of Pori, [[Turku]] and [[Helsinki]]. He also designed the frigate ''[[Russian frigate Rurik (1851)|Rurik]]'' (1851) and the corvette ''[[Kalevala (corvette)|Kalevala]]'' (1858), both built at the [[Åbo Skeppswarf|Turku Old Shipyard]]. During the [[Crimean War]] Schantz served in the Baltic Fleet. He was promoted to [[vice admiral]] in 1855 and admiral 1866. Schantz was a member of the Russian Board of Admiralty from February 1863 to his death.

Schantz published his Swedish language memoirs with the pen name ''En gammal sjöman'' (The Old Sailor) in 1870–1871.

==Gospel narratives==
{{see also|Baptism of Jesus|Beheading of Saint John the Baptist}}
John the Baptist is mentioned in all four canonical [[Gospel]]s and the non-canonical [[Gospel of the Nazarenes]]. The [[Synoptic Gospels]] ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]) describe John baptising Jesus; in the [[Gospel of John]] this is implied in {{bibleverse||John|1:32–1:34|NKJV}}.

===In Mark===
[[File:Brueghel l'Ancien - La Prédication de Saint Jean-Baptiste.jpg|thumb|right|''The Preaching of St. John the Baptist'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]|upright=1.8]]
The Gospel of Mark introduces John as a fulfilment of a prophecy from the [[Book of Isaiah]] (in fact, a conflation of texts from Isaiah, [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]])&lt;ref name="Carl R. Kazmierski 1996 page 31"&gt;Carl R. Kazmierski, ''John the Baptist: Prophet and Evangelist'' (Liturgical Press, 1996) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; about a messenger being sent ahead, and a voice crying out in the wilderness. John is described as wearing clothes of camel's hair, living on [[locust]]s and wild [[honey]]. John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit.

Jesus comes to John, and is baptized by him in the river Jordan. The account describes how; as he emerges from the water, the heavens open and the Holy Spirit descends on him 'like a dove'. A voice from heaven then says, "You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased." ({{bibleref2|Mark|1:1–8|NRSV}})

Later in the gospel there is an account of John's death. It is introduced by an incident where the Tetrarch [[Herod Antipas]], hearing stories about Jesus, imagines that this is John the Baptist raised from the dead. It then explains that John had rebuked Herod for marrying [[Herodias]], the ex-wife of his brother (named here as Philip). Herodias demands his execution, but Herod, who 'liked to listen' to John, is reluctant to do so because he fears him, knowing he is a 'righteous and holy man'.

The account then describes how Herod's daughter Herodias ([[NRSV]]; other translations refer to the girl as the ''daughter of Herodias'') dances before Herod, who is pleased and offers her anything she asks for in return. When the girl asks her mother what she should request, she is told to demand the head of John the Baptist. Reluctantly, Herod orders the beheading of John, and his head is delivered to her, at her request, on a plate. John's disciples take the body away and bury it in a tomb.({{bibleref2|Mark|6:17–29|NRSV}})

There are a number of difficulties with this passage. The Gospel wrongly identifies Antipas as 'King'&lt;ref&gt;John R. Donahue, Daniel J. Harrington, ''The Gospel of Mark'' (Liturgical Press, 2005) p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ex-husband of Herodias is named as Philip, but he is known to have been called [[Herod II|Herod]].&lt;ref name="Gillman2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Florence Morgan Gillman|title=Herodias: At Home in that Fox's Den|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFRFe8QdO1gC|year=2003|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5108-7|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the wording clearly implies the girl was the daughter of Herodias, many texts describe her as "Herod's daughter, Herodias". Since these texts are early and significant and the reading is '[[Lectio difficilior potior|difficult]]', many scholars see this as the original version, corrected in later versions and in Matthew and Luke.&lt;ref name="Gillman2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoff R.

Scholars have speculated about the origins of the story.

; John and his baptism of Jesus (Mark 1)
As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,
"Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
who will prepare your way,
the voice of one crying in the wilderness:
'Prepare the way of the Lord,
make his paths straight,'"

John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."

In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son, with you I am well pleased."

; Death of John (Mark 6)

King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him." But others said, "He is Elijah." And others said, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old." But when Herod heard of it, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised." For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.

But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you." And he vowed to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom." And she went out and said to her mother, "For what should I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist." And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter." And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.

Unlike Mark, Matthew describes John as critical of Pharisees and Sadducees and as preaching "the kingdom of heaven is at hand" and a "coming judgment".

Matthew shortens the account of the beheading of John, and adds two elements: that Herod Antipas wants John dead, and that the death is reported to Jesus by his disciples.&lt;ref name="Wink2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Wink|title=John the Baptist in the Gospel Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWNe6CwgPKwC&amp;pg=PA27|date=November 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-03130-1|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew's approach is to shift the focus away from Herod and onto John as a prototype of Jesus. Where Mark has Herod killing John reluctantly and at Herodias' insistence, Matthew describes him as wanting John dead.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Horton Gundry, ''Matthew: A Commentary on His Handbook for a Mixed Church Under Persecution'' (Eerdmans, 1994) p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

; John and his baptism of Jesus (Matthew 3)
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,

"The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
'Prepare the way of the Lord;
make his paths straight.'"

Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."

Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?" But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he consented. And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."

; John questions Jesus (Matthew 11)

Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?" And Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not offended by me."

As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written,

"'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
who will prepare your way before you.'

Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,

"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;
we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'

For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds."

; Death of John (Matthew 14)

At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him." For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her." And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter." And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.

; Post-nativity

Unique to the Gospel of Luke, John the Baptist explicitly teaches charity, baptizes tax-collectors, and advises soldiers.

The text briefly mentions that John is imprisoned and later beheaded by Herod, but the Gospel of Luke lacks the story of a step-daughter dancing for Herod and requesting John's head.

The [[Book of Acts]] portrays some disciples of John becoming followers of Jesus {{bibleref2|Acts|18:24–19:6|NRSV}} a development not reported by the gospels except for the early case of [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], Simon Peter's brother {{bibleref2|John|1:35–42|NRSV}}

{{hidden begin|border=solid 1px #aaa|title=John the Baptist in the Gospel of Luke and Acts}}
; Nativity of John (Luke 1)
In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.

One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division, it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense; and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside. And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense. Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck. But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John. He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth, and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God. He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, 'to reconcile fathers to their children' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him."

"How can I be sure of this?" Zechariah asked the angel. "For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years."

"I am Gabriel," the angel answered, "who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course."

Meanwhile, the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple. When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb. And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home. After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months. "The Lord has done this for me," she said, "he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living."

Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary. Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying: "You have been shown great favor – the Lord is with you."

Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean, when the angel spoke again: "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus. The child will be great and will be called 'Son of the Most High,' and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David, and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end."

"How can this be?" Mary asked the angel. "For I have no husband."

"The Holy Spirit will descend on you," answered the angel, "and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called 'holy,' and 'Son of God.' And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren; for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled."

"I am the servant of the Lord," exclaimed Mary; "let it be with me as you have said." Then the angel left her.

Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah; and there she went into Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried aloud: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child! But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight! Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled."

And Mary said:

"My soul exalts the Lord,
my spirit delights in God my Savior;
for he has remembered his humble servant girl;
And from this hour all ages will count me happy!

Great things has the Almighty done for me;
And holy is his name.
From age to age his mercy rests
On those who honor him.

Mighty are the deeds of his arm;
He scatters the proud with their own devices,
he casts down princes from their thrones,
and the humble he uplifts,
the hungry he loads with gifts,
and the rich he sends empty away.

He has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel,
Ever mindful of his mercy
(As he promised to our forefathers)
For Abraham and his race for ever."

Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home. When Elizabeth's time came, she gave birth to a son; and her neighbors and relations, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy. A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him 'Zechariah' after his father, when his mother spoke up: "No, he is to be called John."

"You have no relation of that name!" they exclaimed; and they made signs to the child's father, to find out what he wished the child to be called. Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words – 'His name is John.' Everyone was surprised; and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God. All their neighbors were awe-struck at this; and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about; and all who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another – "What can this child be destined to become?" For the Power of the Lord was with him.

Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:

"Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,
Who has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,
and has raised up for us the Strength of our salvation
In the house of his servant David –

As he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old –
salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,
showing mercy to our forefathers,
And mindful of his sacred covenant.

This was the oath which he swore to our forefather Abraham –
That we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,
and should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness,
In his presence all our days.

And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,
For you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,
to give his people the knowledge of salvation
In the forgiveness of their sins,

through the tender mercy of our God,
Whereby the Dawn will break on us from heaven,
to give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death,
And guide our feet into the way of peace."

The child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel.

; John and his baptism of Jesus, Imprisonment of John (Luke 3)

In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene, and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness. And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins. This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah –

'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:
"Make ready the way of the Lord,
Make his paths straight.
Every chasm will be filled,
Every mountain and hill will be leveled,
The winding ways will be straightened,
The rough roads made smooth,
and everyone will see the salvation of God."'

And John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him: "You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment? Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves 'Abraham is our ancestor,' for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."

"What are we to do then?" the people asked. "Let anyone who has two coats," answered John, "share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same."

Even tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John: "Teacher, what are we to do?"

"Do not collect more than you have authority to demand," John answered. And when some soldiers on active service asked "And we – what are we to do?" he said: "Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay."

Then, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ, John, addressing them all, said: "I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out."

And so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people. But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod's brother, and for all the evil things that he had done,  crowned them all by shutting John up in prison. Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened,  and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice – "You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy."

; John's disciples and fast (Luke 5:33)
"John's disciples," they said to Jesus, "Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!"

; John questions Jesus (Luke 7)
All these events were reported to John by his disciples. So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask – "Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for some one else?"

When these men found Jesus, they said: "John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask – 'Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for somebody else?'" At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight. So his answer to the question was: "Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard – the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor. And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me."

When John's messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces. What then did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. This is the man of whom scripture says –

'I am sending my messenger ahead of you,
and he will prepare your way before you.'

There is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John; and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."

(All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax-gatherers, having accepted John's baptism, acknowledged the justice of God. But the Pharisees and the students of the law, having rejected John's baptism, frustrated God's purpose in regard to them.)

===In the Gospel of John===
The fourth gospel describes John the Baptist as "a man sent from God" who "was not the light", but "came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, so that through him everyone might believe".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|1:6-8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; John clearly denies being the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet', instead describing himself as the "voice of one crying in the wilderness".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|1:23|NKJV}}, compare {{bibleverse||Isaiah|40:3|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon literary analysis, it is clear that John is the "testifier and confessor ''par excellence''", particularly when compared to figures like [[Nicodemus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Vande Vrede|first=Keith|title=A Contrast Between Nicodemus and John the Baptist in the Gospel of John|volume=57|date=December 2014|pages=715–26|editor-last=Kostenberger|editor-first=Andreas|journal=Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society|issue=4|issn=0360-8808|editor-link=Andreas J.

[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 024.jpg|thumb|[[Matthias Grünewald]], detail of the ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]''|upright]]
Jesus's baptism is implied but not depicted. Unlike the other gospels, it is John himself who testifies to seeing "the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him". John explicitly announces that Jesus is the one "who baptizes with the Holy Spirit" and John even professes a "belief that he is the Son of God" and "the Lamb of God".

The Gospel of John reports that Jesus' disciples were baptizing and that a debate broke out between some of the disciples of John and another Jew about purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|John|3:22–36|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this debate John argued that Jesus "must become greater," while he (John) "must become less"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|John|3:30|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin]] [[Vulgate]]: {{bibleref2|Ioannes|3:30|VULGATE|''illum oportet crescere me autem minui''}}).

The Gospel of John then points out that Jesus' disciples were baptizing more people than John.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|John|4:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Gospel relates that Jesus regarded John as "a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|John|5:35|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hidden begin|border=solid 1px #aaa|title=John the Baptist in the Gospel of John}}
; John 1
There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John; he came as a witness – to bear witness to the light so that through him everyone might believe. He was not the light, but he came to bear witness to the light.

When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John – "Who are you?", he told them clearly and simply: "I am not the Christ."

"What then?" they asked. "Are you Elijah?"
"No," he said, "I am not."
"Are you 'the prophet'?" He answered, "No."
"Who then are you?" they continued; "tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
"I," he answered, "am – 'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness – "make a straight road for the Lord"', as the prophet Isaiah said."
These men had been sent from the Pharisees; and their next question was: "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet'?" John's answer was – "I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know; he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal." This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed: "Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! I was taking about him when I said 'After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.' I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel."

John also said: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me 'He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him – he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God." The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples, he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed: "There is the Lamb of God!" The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.

; John 3
John, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized. (For John had not yet been imprisoned). Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of 'purification;' and the disciples came to John and said: "Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony – he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him." John's answer was – "A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven. You are yourselves witnesses that I said 'I am not the Christ,' but 'I have been sent before him as a messenger.' It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom's friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom's voice. This joy I have felt to the full. He must become greater, and I less."

He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others. He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement. They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true. For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God's own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit. The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands. The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under 'God's displeasure.'

===Comparative analysis===
Simon J. Joseph has argued that the Gospel demotes the historical John by painting him only as a prophetic forerunner to Jesus whereas his ministry actually complemented Jesus'.&lt;ref name="Joseph2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon J. Joseph|title=Jesus, Q, and the Dead Sea Scrolls: A Judaic Approach to Q|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eskHkKgnxk8C&amp;pg=PA130|year=2012|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-152120-1|pages=147–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; The prophecy of Isaiah

Although Mark's Gospel implies that the arrival of John the Baptist is the fulfilment of a prophecy from the [[Book of Isaiah]], the words quoted ("I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way – a voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'") are actually a composite of texts from [[Second Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] and the [[Book of Exodus]]. (Matthew and Luke drop the first part of the reference.)&lt;ref name="Carl R. Kazmierski 1996 page 31"/&gt;

; Baptism of Jesus

The gospels differ on the details of the Baptism. In Mark and Luke, Jesus himself sees the heavens open and hears a voice address him personally, saying, "You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy". They do not clarify whether others saw and heard these things. Although other incidents where the "voice came out of heaven" are recorded in which, for the sake of the crowds, it was heard audibly, John did say in his witness that he did see the spirit coming down "out of heaven". John 12:28–30, John 1:32

In Matthew, the voice from heaven does not address Jesus personally, saying instead "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased."

In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend as a dove, testifying about the experience as evidence of Jesus's status.

; John's knowledge of Jesus

John's knowledge of Jesus varies across gospels. In the Gospel of Mark, John preaches of a coming leader, but shows no signs of recognizing that Jesus is this leader. In Matthew, however, John immediately recognizes Jesus and John questions his own worthiness to baptize Jesus. In both Matthew and Luke, John later dispatches disciples to question Jesus about his status, asking "Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?"
In Luke, John is a familial relative of Jesus whose birth was foretold by Gabriel.
In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend like a dove and he explicitly preaches that Jesus is the Son of God.

; John and Elijah
{{see also|Matthew 3:4}}
The Gospels vary in their depiction of John's relationship to [[Elijah]]. Matthew and Mark describe John's attire in a way reminiscent of the description of Elijah in [[2 Kings 1:8]], who also wore a garment of hair and a leather belt. In Matthew, Jesus explicitly teaches that John is "Elijah who was to come" (Matt. 11:14 – see also Matt. 17:11–13); many Christian theologians have taken this to mean that John was Elijah's successor. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist explicitly denies being Elijah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carm.org/bible-difficulties/matthew-mark/was-john-baptist-really-elijah |title=Was John the Baptist really Elijah? &amp;#124; Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry |publisher=Carm.org |date=March 15, 2013 |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the annunciation narrative in Luke, an angel appears to Zechariah, John's father, and tells him that John "will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God," and that he will go forth "in the spirit and power of Elijah ({{Bibleverse||Luke|1:16–17|NAB}})."

==In Josephus's ''Antiquities of the Jews''==
An account of John the Baptist is found in all extant manuscripts of the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (book 18, chapter 5, 2) by [[Flavius Josephus]] (37–100):&lt;ref&gt;"Josephus, Flavius." In: Cross, F. L. (ed.) (2005) ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', 3rd ed. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's [Antipas's] army came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for that the washing [with water] would be acceptable to him, if they made use of it, not in order to the putting away [or the remission] of some sins [only], but for the purification of the body; supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness. Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, (for they seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,) thought it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to [[Machaerus|Macherus]], the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death. Now the Jews had an opinion that the destruction of this army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and a mark of God's displeasure to him.&lt;ref name="Josephus18"&gt;[[Flavius Josephus]], [http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-18.htm ''Jewish Antiqities'' 18. 5. 2.] (Translation by William Whiston). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0145%3Abook%3D18%3Awhiston+chapter%3D5%3Awhiston+section%3D2 Original Greek].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to this passage, the execution of John was blamed for the defeat Herod suffered. Some have claimed that this passage indicates that John died near the time of the destruction of Herod's army in 36 AD. However, in a different passage, Josephus states that the end of Herod's marriage with Aretas' daughter (after which John was killed) was only the beginning of hostilities between Herod and Aretas, which later escalated into the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoehner|first1=Harold W.|title=Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fS28b9GC1dcC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780310877103|date=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divergences between the passage's presentation and the biblical accounts of John include baptism for those whose souls have already been "purified beforehand by righteousness" is for purification of the body, not general repentance of sin (Mark 1:4).&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Mark|1:4|NRSV"&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|1:4|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scholar [[John Dominic Crossan]] differentiates between Josephus's account of John and Jesus, saying, "John had a monopoly, but Jesus had a franchise." To get baptized, Crossan writes, you went only to John; to stop the movement one only needed to stop John (therefore his movement ended with his death). Jesus invited all to come and see how he and his companions had already accepted the government of God, entered it and were living it. Such a communal praxis was not just for himself, but could survive without him, unlike John's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, John Dominic (2007), ''God and Empire'', London: HarperCollins, p. 117 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relics==
{{see also|Beheading of Saint John the Baptist#Relics}}
[[File:Nabi Yahya Mosque, Sebastia, c. 1920.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nabi Yahya Mosque]], the traditional burial site in [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]], near [[Nablus]], the [[West Bank]], the Levant.]]
{{bibleverse||Matthew|14:12|NKJV}} records that "his disciples came and took away [John's] body and buried it". Theologian [[Joseph Benson]] refers to a belief that "it seems that [the body] had been thrown over the prison walls, without burial, probably by order of Herodias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/14.htm Benson's Commentary] on Matthew 14, accessed 17 Jauuary 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The burial-place of John the Baptist was traditionally said to be at the [[Nabi Yahya Mosque]] (Saint John the Baptiste Mosque) in [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]] in current [[Palestinian territories]], and mention is made of his [[relic]]s being honored there around the middle of the 4th century. The historians [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] and [[Theodoretus]] record that the [[shrine]] was [[desecration|desecrated]] under [[Julian the Apostate]] around 362, the bones being partly burned. A portion of the rescued relics were carried to [[Jerusalem]], then to [[Alexandria]], where on 27 May 395, they were laid in the [[basilica]] newly dedicated to the Forerunner on the former site of the [[Serapeum#Alexandria|temple of Serapis]]. The tomb at Sebaste continued, nevertheless, to be visited by pious [[pilgrim]]s, and [[Saint Jerome]] bears witness to miracles being worked there.

What became of the head of John the Baptist is difficult to determine. [[Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopoulos|Nicephorus]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicephorus, ''Ecclesiastical History'' I, ix. ''See'' [[Patrologia Graeca]], cxlv.–cxlvii.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Symeon Metaphrastes]] say that Herodias had it buried in the fortress of [[Machaerus]] (in accordance with Josephus). Other writers say that it was interred in Herod's palace at Jerusalem; there it was found during the reign of [[Constantine I]], and thence secretly taken to [[Emesa]] where it was concealed, the place remaining unknown for years, until it was manifested by [[revelation]] in 453. However, the decapitation cloth of Saint John is kept at the [[Aachen Cathedral]]. The Coptic Christian Orthodox Church also claim to hold the relics of Saint John the Baptist. These are to be found in a monastery in Lower Egypt between Cairo and Alexandria. It is possible, with permission from the monks, to see the original tomb where the remains were found.

==Religious views==

===Christianity===
[[File:San Juan Bautista por Joan de Joanes.jpg|thumb|upright|''John the Baptist'', by {{Interlanguage link multi|Juan de Juanes|es}}, c. 1560]]
[[File:Rom, Basilika San Giovanni in Laterano, Hl. Johannes der Täufer 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''John the Baptist'', [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], [[Rome]]]]
Christians believe that John the Baptist had a specific role ordained by [[God in Christianity|God]] as forerunner or precursor of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], who was the foretold [[Messiah]]. The New Testament Gospels speak of this role. In {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:17}} the role of John is referred to as being "to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord." In {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:76}} as "...thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways" and in {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:77}} as being "To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins."

There are several passages within the [[Old Testament]] which are interpreted by Christians as being [[prophecy|prophetic]] of John the Baptist in this role. These include a passage in the [[Book of Malachi]] ({{Bibleref2|Malachi 3:1}}) that refers to a prophet who would ''prepare the way of the Lord'':

{{quote|Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.|Malachi 3:1&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Malachi|3:1|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and also at the end of the next chapter in Malachi 4:5–6 where it says,

{{quote|Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.}}

The Jews of Jesus' day expected Elijah to come before the Messiah; indeed, some present day Jews continue to await Elijah's coming as well, as in the Cup of Elijah the Prophet in the [[Passover Seder]]. This is why the disciples ask Jesus in {{Bibleref2|Matthew 17:10}}, 'Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?' The disciples are then told by Jesus that Elijah came in the person of John the Baptist,

{{quote|Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands." Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.|Matthew 17:11–13}} (see also 11:14: "...if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who was to come.")

These passages are applied to John in the [[Synoptic Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;Mat 3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mar 1:2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. Mar 1:3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk 1:16–17 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&lt;/ref&gt; But where Matthew specifically identifies John the Baptist as Elijah's spiritual successor ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 11.14, 17.13}}), the gospels of Mark and Luke are silent on the matter. The [[Gospel of John]] states that John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.

{{quote|Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. He did not deny, but confessed freely, "I am not the Christ." They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."|John 1:19–21}}

====Influence on Paul====
Many scholars believe there was contact between the early church in the [[Apostolic Age]] and what is called the "[[Qumran]]-[[Essene]] community".&lt;ref name=EDSS&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-508450-4| title = Paul, Letters of| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls| date = 2008| doi = 10.1093/acref/9780195084504.001.0001/acref-9780195084504-e-383| doi-broken-date = 2018-09-22}}{{subscription|[[OUP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] were found at Qumran, which the majority of historians and archaeologists identify as an Essene settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-506512-1| title = Essenes | encyclopedia = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East| date = 2011| doi = 10.1093/acref/9780195065121.001.0001/acref-9780195065121-e-354| doi-broken-date = 2018-09-22}}{{subscription|[[OUP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
John the Baptist is thought to have been either an Essene or "associated" with the community at Khirbet Qumran. According to the [[Book of Acts]], Paul met some "disciples of John" in [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Acts|19:1–7|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to influence of Qumranic terminology and ideas in Paul's [[Epistle to the Ephesians]], some scholars believe that the "disciples" mentioned in {{Bibleref2|Acts 19:1–7}} were disciples of John the Baptist.{{dubious|The Acts text is quite clear: they WERE disciples of John the Baptist.

[[File:John the Baptist by Prokopiy Chirin (1620s, GTG).jpg|thumb|Eastern Orthodox [[icon]] ''John the Baptist – the Angel of the Desert'' ([[Stroganov School]], 1620s) [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]].]]
The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches|Eastern Orthodox]] faithful believe that John was the last of the [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s, thus serving as a bridge between that period of [[revelation]] and the [[New Covenant]]. They also teach that, following his death, John descended into [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]] and there once more preached that Jesus the Messiah was coming, so he was the Forerunner of Christ in death as he had been in life. Eastern Catholic and Orthodox churches will often have an [[icon]] of Saint John the Baptist in a place of honor on the [[iconostasis]], and he is frequently mentioned during the [[Divine Services]]. Every Tuesday throughout the year is dedicated to his memory.

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] remembers Saint John the Forerunner on six separate feast days, listed here in order in which they occur during the [[liturgical year|church year]] (which begins on September 1):
* 23 September – Conception of Saint John the Forerunner&lt;ref&gt;In late antiquity this feast in some churches marked the beginning of the [[Ecclesiastical Year]]; see Archbishop Peter (L'Huiller) of New York and New Jersey, "[http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/liturgics/peter_archbishop_liturgical_matters.htm Liturgical Matters: "The Lukan Jump"]", in: ''Newspaper of the Diocese of New York and New Jersey'', Fall 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7 January – The [[Synaxis]] of Saint John the Forerunner. This is his main ml day, immediately after [[Epiphany (feast)|Theophany]] on January 6 (January 7 also commemorates the transfer of the relic of the right hand of John the Baptist from [[Antioch]] to [[Constantinople]] in 956)
* 24 February – First and Second Finding of the Head of Saint John the Forerunner
* 25 May – Third Finding of the Head of Saint John the Forerunner
* 24 June – [[Nativity of Saint John the Forerunner]]
* 29 August – The [[Beheading of Saint John the Forerunner]], a day of strict fast and abstinence from meat and dairy products and foods containing meat or dairy products

In addition to the above, 5 September is the commemoration of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] and [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], Saint John's parents. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] observes 12 October as the Transfer of the Right Hand of the Forerunner from [[Malta]] to [[Gatchina]] (1799).

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormon church) teaches that modern revelation confirms the biblical account of John and also makes known additional events in his ministry. According to this belief, John was "ordained by the angel of God" when he was eight days old "to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews" and to prepare a people for the Lord. Latter-day Saints also believe that "he was baptized while yet in his childhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/84|title=Doctrine and Covenants 84:27–28|publisher=Scriptures.lds.org|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Smith]] said: "Let us come into New Testament times – so many are ever praising the Lord and His apostles. We will commence with John the Baptist. When Herod's edict went forth to destroy the young children, John was about six months older than Jesus, and came under this hellish edict, and Zecharias caused his mother to take him into the mountains, where he was raised on locusts and wild honey. When his father refused to disclose his hiding place, and being the officiating high priest at the Temple that year, was slain by Herod's order, between the porch and the altar, as Jesus said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boap.org/LDS/Joseph-Smith/Teachings/T5.html |title=Section Five: 1842–1843 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Teaching of The Prophet Joseph Smith Section Five 1842–43, p. 261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Jesus Christ teaches that John the Baptist appeared on the banks of the [[Susquehanna River]] near [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]] as a resurrected being to [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] on May 15, 1829, and ordained them to the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic Priesthood]].&lt;ref&gt;[D&amp;C 13]; D&amp;C 27:7–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith History 1:68–72&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Church's dispensational view of religious history, John's ministry has operated in three dispensations: he was the last of the prophets under the law of Moses; he was the first of the New Testament prophets; and he was sent to confirm the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic Priesthood]] in our day (the [[dispensation of the fulness of times]]). Latter-day Saints believe John's ministry was foretold by two prophets whose teachings are included in the [[Book of Mormon]]: [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon/1_Nephi#10:7|title=1 Nephi 10:7–10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624211708/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon/1_Nephi#10:7|archivedate=June 24, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=11|verse=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=2 Nephi|chapter=31|verse=4|range=-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gnosticism===
In [[Gnosticism]], John the Baptist was a "personification" of the [[Old Testament]] prophet Elijah. Elijah did not know the True God (as opposed to the [[Abrahamic God]]), and thus had to be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] in Gnostic [[theology]]. As predicted by the Old Testament prophet [[Malachi]], Elijah must "come first" to herald the coming of Jesus Christ. Modern [[anthroposophy]] concurs with the idea that the Baptist was a reincarnation of Elijah, (cf. Mark 9:11–13),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|9:11–13|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew 11:13–14,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|11:13–14|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luke 7:27&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|7:27|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although John the Baptist in the [[Gospel of John]] explicitly denies being linked to Elijah (John 1:21).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|1:21|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Prokofieff, ''The Mystery of John the Baptist and John the Evangelist Turning Point of Time: An Esoteric Study'', Temple Lodge Publishing 2005, {{ISBN|1-902636-67-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syrian-Egyptian Gnosticism====
Among the early Judeo-Christian Gnostics the [[Ebionites]] held that John, along with Jesus and [[James the Just]] – all of whom they revered – were vegetarians.&lt;ref name="Verheyden"&gt;J Verheyden, ''Epiphanius on the Ebionites'', in ''The image of the Judaeo-Christians in ancient Jewish and Christian literature'', eds Peter J. Tomson, Doris Lambers-Petry, {{ISBN|3-16-148094-5}}, p. 188 "The vegetarianism of John the Baptist and of Jesus is an important issue too in the Ebionite interpretation of the Christian life. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Eisenman]] (1997), ''[[James the Brother of Jesus (book)|James the Brother of Jesus]]'', p. 240 – "John (unlike Jesus) was both a 'Rechabite' or 'Nazarite' and vegetarian", p. 264 – "One suggestion is that John ate 'carobs'; there have been others. Epiphanius, in preserving what he calls 'the Ebionite Gospel', rails against the passage there claiming that John ate 'wild honey' and 'manna-like vegetarian cakes dipped in oil. ... John would have been one of those wilderness-dwelling, vegetable-eating persons", p. 326 – "They [the Nazerini] ate nothing but wild fruit milk and honey – probably the same food that John the Baptist also ate.", p. 367 – "We have already seen how in some traditions 'carobs' were said to have been the true composition of John's food.", p. 403 – "his [John's] diet was stems, roots and fruits. Like James and the other Nazirites/Rechabites, he is presented as a vegetarian ..".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Tabor]], ''[[The Jesus Dynasty]]'' p. 134 and footnotes p. 335, p. 134 – "The Greek New Testament gospels says John's diet consisted of "locusts and wild honey" but an ancient Hebrew version of Matthew insists that "locusts" is a mistake in Greek for a related Hebrew word that means a cake of some type, made from a desert plant, similar to the "manna" that the ancient Israelites ate in the desert on the days of Moses.(ref 9) Jesus describes John as "neither eating nor drinking," or "neither eating bread nor drinking wine." Such phrases indicate the lifestyle of one who is strictly vegetarian, avoids even bread since it has to be processed from grain, and shuns all alcohol.(ref 10) The idea is that one would eat only what grows naturally.(ref 11) It was a way of avoiding all refinements of civilization."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2003 on Gospel of the Ebionites"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bart D.

==== Mandaeans ====
John the Baptist is considered the chief prophet of the [[Mandaean]]s, and plays a large part in some of their writings,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Mandaeans''&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Ginza Rba]] and the [[Draša D-Iahia]] (The Mandaean Book of John). They view John as the only true [[Messiah]], and are opposed to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 550&lt;/ref&gt; The Mandaean scriptures state: "If the carpenter [Jesus] has joined together the god, who then has joined together the carpenter?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://essenes.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=350&amp;Itemid=796 |title=Baptisms of Yeshu in ancient Mandaic scrolls – The Order of Nazorean Essenes |publisher=Essenes.net |date= |accessdate=October 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001111543/http://essenes.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=350&amp;Itemid=796 |archive-date=October 1, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam=== &lt;!-- courtesy noe per [[WP:RSECT]]: {{John in Islam]] links here --&gt;
{{Islamic prophets|Prophets in the Quran}}
John is also honored as a ''[[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Nabi]]'' ({{lang-ar|نَـبِي}}, Prophet) as ({{lang|ar|يحيى بن زكريا}}''Yaḥyā ibn Zakarīyā'') ({{lang-ar|يحيى|Yaḥyā}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam101.com/history/people/prophets/john.htm|title=Prophet John|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or "John, son of Zechariah". He is believed by [[Muslim]]s to have been a witness to the [[Revelation|word of God]], and a [[prophet]] who would herald the coming of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;"Yahya", Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Islamic view of Zechariah|Zechariah]] was also an Islamic prophet. [[Islam]]ic tradition maintains that John was one of the prophets whom [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] met on the night of the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]],&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq, ''Sirat Rasul Allah'', Mi'raj&lt;/ref&gt; his ascension through the [[Seven Heavens]]. It is said that he met John and Jesus in the second heaven, where Muhammad greeted his two brothers before ascending with [[archangel]] [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Gabriel]] to the third heaven. John's story was also told to the [[Aksumite Empire|Abyssinian]] king during the Muslim refugees' [[Migration to Abyssinia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Muhammad'', Martin Lings, Abysinnia. etc.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Qur'an]], John was one on whom God sent peace on the day that he was born and the day that he died.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|19|13|e=15|s=ns"&gt;{{Cite quran|19|13|e=15|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quran====
In the [[Quran]], [[God in Islam|God]] frequently mentions Zechariah's continuous praying for the birth of a son. Zechariah's wife, mentioned in the New Testament as [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], was barren and therefore the birth of a child seemed impossible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Lives of the Prophets'', Leila Azzam, ''John and Zechariah''&lt;/ref&gt; As a gift from God, Zechariah (or Zakaria) was given a son by the name of "Yaḥya", a name specially chosen for this child alone. In accordance with Zechariah's prayer, God made John and Jesus, who according to [[exegesis]] was born six months later,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''A–Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''John the Baptist''&lt;/ref&gt; renew the message of God, which had been corrupted and lost by the [[Israelites]]. As the Quran says:

{{Quote|(His prayer was answered): "O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son: His name shall be Yahya: on none by that name have We conferred distinction before."

He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?"

He said: "So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!'"

(Zakarya) said: "O my Lord! give me a Sign." "Thy Sign," was the answer, "Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights."|Quran, [[sura]] 19 ([[Maryam (sura)|Maryam]]), [[ayah|verse]] 7&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|7|e=10|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John was exhorted to hold fast to the [[Scripture]] and was given wisdom by God while still a child.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|19|12|s=ns"&gt;{{Cite quran|19|12|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was pure and devout, and walked well in the presence of God. He was dutiful towards his parents and he was not arrogant or rebellious. John's reading and understanding of the scriptures, when only a child, surpassed even that of the greatest scholars of the time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; [[Muslim]] [[exegesis]] narrates that [[Jesus]] sent John out with twelve disciples,&lt;ref&gt;''Tabari'', i, 712&lt;/ref&gt; who preached the message before Jesus called his own disciples.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; The Quran says:

{{quote|"O Yaḥya! take hold of the Book with might": and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth, |Quran, sura 19 ([[Maryam (sura)|Maryam]]), ayah 12&lt;ref name="Cite quran|19|12|s=ns"/&gt;}} 

John was a classical prophet,&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], ''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]'', Note. '''905''': "The third group consists not of men of action, but Preachers of Truth, who led solitary lives. Their epithet is: "the Righteous." They form a connected group round Jesus. Zachariah was the father of John the Baptist, who is referenced as "Elias, which was for to come" (Matt 11:14); and Elias is said to have been present and talked to Jesus at the Transfiguration on the Mount (Matt. 17:3)."&lt;/ref&gt; who was exalted high by God, for his bold denouncing of all things sinful. Furthermore, the Qur'an speaks of John's gentle pity and love and his humble attitude towards life, for which he was granted the Purity of Life:

{{Quote|And piety&lt;!--"for all creatures" is not in the Qur'an--&gt; as from Us, and purity: He was devout,&lt;br&gt;And kind to his parents, and he was not overbearing or rebellious.&lt;br&gt;So Peace on him the day he was born, the day that he dies, and the day that he will be raised up to life (again)!|Quran, sura 19 ([[Maryam (sura)|Maryam]]), ayah 13–15&lt;ref name="Cite quran|19|13|e=15|s=ns"/&gt;}}

John is also honored highly in [[Sufism]] as well as [[Islamic]] [[mysticism]], primarily because of the Quran's description of John's chastity and kindness.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, ''Yahya ibn Zakkariya'', Online web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufi]]s have frequently applied commentaries on the passages on John in the Quran, primarily concerning the God-given gift of "Wisdom" which he acquired in youth as well as his parallels with [[Jesus]]. Although several phrases used to describe John and Jesus are virtually identical in the Quran, the manner in which they are expressed is different.&lt;ref&gt;Whereas the Quran itself gives blessings of peace to John (Quran 19:15), Jesus, in contrast, gives himself the blessings of peace. (Quran 19: 16–33)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name====
It has been claimed that the Quran is mistaken in saying that John the Baptist was the first to receive this name ({{Cite quran|19|7|e=10|s=ns}}), since the name Yoḥanan occurs many times before John the Baptist.&lt;ref&gt;A. Geiger, ''Judaism And Islam'' (English translation of ''Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen?''), 1970, Ktav Publishing House Inc.: New York, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Islamic scholars, "Yaḥyā" is not the same name as "Yoḥanan".&lt;ref name="islamic-awareness.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Contrad/External/yahya.html |title=And No One Had The Name Yahya (= John?) Before: A Linguistic &amp; Exegetical Enquiry Into Qur'an 19:7 |publisher=Islamic-awareness.org |date= |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, "Yaḥyā" is [[etymologically]] the same name as the [[Biblical]] figure Yᵉchîyâh (English rendering: "Jehiah") of the [[Books of the Chronicles]].&lt;ref name="biblehub.com"&gt;http://biblehub.com/topical/j/jehiah.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the [[Qur'an]] in Surah 19:7 is likely not claiming that "no one was ever given the name Yahya before this child". Rather, this [[Qur'an]] verse is a clear reference to the [[Biblical]] account of the [[Miracle|miraculous]] naming of John, which accounted that he was almost named "Zacharias"&lt;ref&gt;Young's Literal Translation of the Bible. Luke 1:59, 1:5, et al. http://www.biblestudytools.com/ylt/luke/1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King James Bible. Luke 1:59, 1:5, et al. https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Luke-Chapter-1/&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Greek New Testament|Greek]]: Ζαχαρίας)&lt;ref&gt;Ἡ Καινὴ Διαθήκη (1894 Scrivener NT). Luke 1:59, 1:5, et al. https://biblia.com/books/tr1894mr/Lk1?embeddedPreview=False&lt;/ref&gt; after his father's name, as no one in the [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] of his father [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]] (also known as [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]) had been named "John" ("Yohanan"/"Yoannes") before him.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 1:59–63&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[exegete]]s frequently connected the name with the meaning of "to quicken" or "to make alive" in reference to John's mother's barrenness, which was cured by [[God]], as well as John's preaching, which, as [[Muslim]]s believe, "made alive" the faith of [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Jeffrey, ''Foreign Vocab. of the Qur'an'', Baroda 1938, 290–1&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same meaning as the [[Hebrew]] name Yᵉchîyâh (יְחִיָּה; "Jehiah") (lit.: "[[YHWH]] lives").&lt;ref name="biblehub.com"/&gt; Yᵉchîyâh was also the name of one of the doorkeepers for the [[Ark of the Covenant]] during the reign of [[King David]] in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;I Chronicles 15:24&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, it is supposed that this name "Yaḥyā" was commonly used in the 6th–7th centuries CE by [[Arab Christians]] as an [[allegorical]] [[honorific]] of John the Baptist ([[Arabic]]: يُوحَنَّا الْمَعْمَدَانُ, Yūḥanna al-Mamadan), who considered him to be a "doorkeeper" for the "Ark of the [[New Covenant]]", [[Jesus Christ]] ([[Arabic]]: يَسُوعَ الْمَسِيحِ, Yasū'u l-Masīḥ).&lt;ref&gt;cf. I Chronicles 15:24 with Matthew 3:3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran also mentions a root used in the Hebrew name, '[[Yohanan]]' {{lang|he|יוֹחָנָן|rtl=yes}} (Yahweh is gracious). Sura Maryam: 12–13 describes the virtues of Yahya: {{lang|ar|وَآتَيْنَاهُ الْحُكْمَ صَبِيًّا – وَحَنَانًا مِّن لَّدُنَّا وَزَكَاةً}} (And We gave him judgement, while yet a boy – And affection from Us, and purity.) Here 'Ḥanān' ({{lang|ar|حنان|rtl=yes}}, Affection) is an Arabic word corresponding to the same root used in the Hebrew/Aramaic '[[Yohanan]]'.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}{{dubious|date=April 2015}}

===Bahá'í view===
Bahá'ís consider John to have been a prophet of God who like all other prophets was sent to instill the knowledge of God, promote unity among the people of the world, and to show people the correct way to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Epistle to the Son of the Wolf|last = Effendi|first = Shoghi|publisher = Baha'i Publishing Trust|year = 1988|isbn = 9780877430483|location = Wilmette, Illinois|pages = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous quotations in the writings of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], Founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] mentioning John the Baptist. He is regarded by Bahá'ís as a [[Manifestation of God#Minor prophets|lesser Prophet]].&lt;ref name="Compilations 1983 475" /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh claimed that his Forerunner, the [[Báb]], was the spiritual return of John the Baptist. In his letter to Pope [[Pius IX]], Bahá'u'lláh wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;O followers of the Son! We have once again sent John unto you, and He, verily, hath cried out in the wilderness of the [[Persian Bayán|Bayán]]: O peoples of the world! Cleanse your eyes! The Day whereon ye can behold the Promised One and attain unto Him hath drawn nigh! O followers of the Gospel! Prepare the way! The Day of the advent of the Glorious Lord is at hand! Make ready to enter the Kingdom. Thus hath it been ordained by God, He Who causeth the dawn to break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bahá'u'lláh|authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh|year=2002|title=The Summons of the Lord of Hosts|publisher=Bahá'í World Centre|location=Haifa, Israel|page=63|isbn=978-0-85398-976-9|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/SLH/slh-5.html#pg63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John is believed to have had the specific role of foretelling and preparing the way for Jesus. In condemning those who had 'turned aside' from him, Bahá'u'lláh, compared them to the followers of John the Baptist, who, he said, 'protested against Him Who was the Spirit (Jesus) saying: "The dispensation of John hath not yet ended; wherefore hast thou come?" Bahá'u'lláh believed that the Báb played the same role as John in preparing the people for his own coming. As such Bahá'u'lláh refers to the  Báb as 'My Forerunner', the Forerunner being a title that Christians reserve for John the Baptist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Epistle to the Son of the Wolf|last = Effendi|first = Shoghi|publisher = Baha'i Publish Trust|year = 1988|isbn = 9780877430483|location = Wilmette, Illinois|pages = 157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Bahá'ís consider the [[Báb]] to be a greater Prophet ([[Manifestation of God]]) and thus possessed of a far greater station than John the Baptist.

===Unification Church===

The [[Unification Church]] teaches that [[God]] intended John to help Jesus during his public ministry in Judea. In particular, John should have done everything in his power to persuade the Jewish people that Jesus was the Messiah. He was to become Jesus' main disciple and John's disciples were to become Jesus' disciples. Unfortunately John didn't follow Jesus and continued his own way of baptizing people.   Moreover, John also denied that he was Elijah when queried by several Jewish leaders {{bibleverse||John|1:21|NKJV}} contradicting Jesus who stated  John is Elijah who was to come, {{bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|NKJV}}.   Many Jews therefore, could not accept Jesus as the Messiah because John denied being Elijah, as the prophet's appearance was a prerequisite for the Messiah's arrival as stated in {{bibleverse||Malachi|4:5|NKJV}}. According to the Unification Church, "John the Baptist was in the position of representing Elijah's physical body, making himself identical with Elijah from the standpoint of their mission."

Jesus stated in {{bibleverse||Matthew|11:11|NKJV}}, "there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist," however, in referring to John's blocking the way of the Jews' understanding of himself as the Messiah, said "yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."   John's failure to follow Jesus became the chief obstacle to the fulfillment of Jesus' mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unification.net/dp96/dp96-1-4.html |title=Exposition of the Divine Principle, 1996 Translation, Chapter 4|publisher=unification.net |accessdate=July 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DIVINE PRINCIPLE, PART I CHAPTER 4; ADVENT OF THE MESSIAH  https://www.unification.net/dp73/dp73-1-4.html#1 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;5.

===Other scholarship===

Inside of mainstream Christianity,  various scholars and professionals have studied John the Baptist, particularly his relationship with Jesus of Nazareth, his cousin; and have commented on the difficulties they found between the two men. 

For example, as reported in ''[[The Christian Post]]'', professor Candida Moss, of New Testament and early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame,  who appeared in a documentary series "Finding Jesus,  Faith Fact Forgery,"   noted John and Jesus become  "de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace."   Even after baptizing Jesus, John did not follow Jesus but maintained a separate ministry.    

After John's death, Jesus' followers had to differentiate him from the executed prophet, "countering the prevalent idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead."  Disciples present before Jesus indicated some people believed he was John the Baptist ({{bibleref2|Matthew|16:13-14|NET}}). &lt;ref&gt;https://www.christianpost.com/news/were-jesus-and-john-the-baptist-competitors-finding-jesus-professor-describes-their-relationship-135434/&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael H. Crosby, Ph.D., Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA; Capuchin friar and priest; in his paper "Why Didn’t John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?," stated there was "no biblical evidence indicating that John the Baptist ever became a disciple of Jesus."  He conveys that John's concept of what a messiah should be, was in contrast to how Jesus presented himself, and kept him from becoming a disciple of Jesus.  Crosby identifies 25 points in the Gospel accounts that lead to the conclusion that John's effectiveness as a “Precursor” in encouraging others to follow Jesus was very minimal, since the scriptures record only two of his own followers became Jesus’ disciples.   Crosby noted,  while many others believed Jesus' miracles, there is no record of these "signs" convincing John, who continued a separate  baptismal ministry, creating disciples resulting in a community that still exists in parts of the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/disciples-st-john-baptist-under-attack-2013121593050127653.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosby stated  "an unbiased reading about John the Baptist "leaves us with the figure of John the Baptist as a reformist Jew who also may have wanted desperately to become a believer but was unable to become convinced of Jesus’ messiahship."  &lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Michael H.   "Why Didn’t John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?";  Biblical Theology Bulletin,  Volume 38  Nov, 2008; p158 -162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://michaelcrosby.net/images/uploads/documents/BTBNov08JohnTheBaptist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert L. Deffinbaugh, graduate from Dallas Theological Seminary  pastor/teacher and elder at Community Bible Chapel in Richardson, Texas, wrote a paper "John's Problem with Jesus ({{bibleref2|Luke|7:18-35|NET}})."    He examines the incident where the imprisoned John the Baptist, after receiving news about Jesus, sends two of his disciples  asking Jesus if he were the Messiah or another should be sought.  

John is not asking an incidental  question, but instead is issuing a public challenge precipitating a crises since the message was presented to Jesus while he was with a gathered crowd.  The implication was, if Jesus failed to answer the question satisfactorily  "we will look for someone else to be the Messiah."  Deffinbaugh conveys John might have been looking for inauguration of the kingdom of God in a more dramatic way than what Jesus was implementing, as John had previously warned that "Messiah would come with fire."   Jesus answered the question by evidence of his miracle works and teachings which themselves gave evidence of his identity, "The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.” ({{bibleref2|Luke|7:22|NET}}).  &lt;ref&gt;https://bible.org/seriespage/22-johns-problem-jesus-luke-718-35  June 22nd 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[beheading of Saint John the Baptist]] is a standard theme in Christian art,&lt;ref name="World History"&gt;Wetterau, Bruce. ''World history''. New York: Henry Holt and company. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; in which John's head is often depicted on a platter, which represents the request of Herod's stepdaughter, [[Salome]].&lt;ref&gt;The story appears in {{bibleverse||Matthew|14:8}} and {{bibleverse||Mark|6:25}}, without the name Salome&lt;/ref&gt; He is also depicted as an ascetic wearing camel hair, with a staff and scroll inscribed ''[[Agnus Dei|Ecce Agnus Dei]]'', or bearing a book or dish with a lamb on it.&lt;ref name="ODCC"/&gt; In [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[religious icon|icons]], he often has angel's wings, since Mark 1:2 describes him as a messenger.&lt;ref name="ODCC self"&gt;"John the Baptist, St." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Baptism of Christ'' was one of the earliest scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' to be frequently depicted in [[Early Christian art]], and John's tall, thin, even gaunt, and bearded figure is already established by the 5th century. Only he and Jesus are consistently shown with long hair from Early Christian times, when the apostles generally have trim classical cuts; in fact John is more consistently depicted in this way than Jesus. In [[Byzantine art]] the composition of the ''[[Deesis]]'' came to be included in every [[Eastern Orthodox]] church, as remains the case to this day. Here John and the [[Theotokos]] (Mary) flank a [[Christ Pantocrator]] and intercede for humanity; in many ways this is the equivalent of Western [[Crucifixion]]s on [[rood]]s and elsewhere, where [[John the Evangelist]] takes the place of John the Baptist (except in the idiosyncratic ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]''). John the Baptist is very often shown on altarpieces designed for churches dedicated to him, or where the donor patron was named for him or there was some other connection of patronage – John was the patron saint of [[Florence]], among many other cities, which means he features among the supporting saints in many important works.

A number of narrative scenes from his life were often shown on the [[predella]] of altarpieces dedicated to John, and other settings, notably the large series in [[grisaille]] [[fresco]] in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Chiostro dello Scalzo|it}}, which was [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s largest work, and the frescoed ''Life'' by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] in the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]], both in Florence. There is another important fresco cycle by [[Filippo Lippi]] in [[Prato Cathedral]]. These include the typical scenes:&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tornabuoni Chapel]] for further information on these scenes&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Annunciation to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]'', John's birth, his naming by his father, the ''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'', John's departure for the desert, his preaching in the desert, the ''Baptism of Christ'', John before Herod, the dance of [[Salome]], and his beheading.

[[File:St John the baptist - Leonardo Da Vinci.jpg|thumb|''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|St. John the Baptist]]'' (c.{{nbsp}}1513–16), [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]

His birth, which unlike the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] allowed a relatively wealthy domestic interior to be shown, became increasingly popular as a subject in the late [[Middle Ages]], with depictions by [[Jan van Eyck]] in the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] and Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel being among the best known. His execution, a church feast-day, was often shown, and by the 15th-century scenes such as the dance of Salome became popular, sometimes, as in an [[engraving]] by [[Israhel van Meckenem]], the interest of the artist is clearly in showing the life of Herod's court, given contemporary dress, as much as the martyrdom of the saint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsmia.org/directories/art-finder/art-detail.cfm?directory=0&amp;artist=10346&amp;id=47973&amp;class_2=Israhel%20van%20Meckenem&amp;class_1=Artists|title=Engraving by Israhel van Meckenem|publisher=Artsmia.org|accessdate=February 14, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111185904/http://artsmia.org/directories/art-finder/art-detail.cfm?directory=0&amp;artist=10346&amp;id=47973&amp;class_2=Israhel%20van%20Meckenem&amp;class_1=Artists|archivedate=January 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salome bearing John's head on a platter equally became a subject for the Northern Renaissance taste for images of glamorous but dangerous women ([[Delilah]], [[Judith]] and others),&lt;ref&gt;On this see Chapter V, "The Power of Women", in H Diane Russell;''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints; National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990; {{ISBN|1-55861-039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was often painted by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and engraved by the [[Little Masters]]. These images remained popular into the Baroque, with [[Carlo Dolci]] painting at least three versions. John preaching, in a landscape setting, was a popular subject in Dutch art from [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] and his successors.

As a child (of varying age), he is sometimes shown from the 15th century in family scenes from the life of Christ such as the ''[[Presentation of Christ]]'', the ''[[Marriage of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Holy Kinship]]''. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s versions of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' were influential in establishing a Renaissance fashion for variations on the [[Madonna and Child]] that included John, probably intended to depict the relative's reunion in [[Egypt]], when after Jesus' [[Flight to Egypt]] John was believed to have been carried to join him by an angel.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} [[Raphael]] in particular painted many compositions of the subject, such as the ''[[Alba Madonna]]'', ''[[La belle jardinière]]'', ''[[Aldobrandini Madonna]]'', ''[[Madonna della seggiola]]'', [[Madonna dell'Impannata (Raphael)|''Madonna dell'Impannata'']], which were among his best-known works. John was also often shown by himself as an older child or adolescent, usually already wearing his distinctive dress and carrying a long thin wooden cross – another theme [[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|influenced by Leonardo]], whose equivocal composition, reintroducing the camel-skin dress, was developed by Raphael [[Titian]] and [[Guido Reni]] among many others. Often he is accompanied by a lamb, especially in the many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s which needed this attribute as he wore normal clothes. [[Caravaggio]] painted an especially large number of works including John, from [[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|at least five largely nude youths]] attributed to him, to three late works on his death – the great ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|Execution]]'' in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, [[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|one in Madrid]], and [[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Caravaggio, London)|one in London]].

[[File:St John the Baptist Titular Statue of Xewkija Gozo, Malta.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St John carved out of a blackberry tree by [[Pietro Paolo Azzopardi]] – 1845. [[Xewkija]]]]

Amiens cathedral, which holds one of the alleged heads of the Baptist, has a biographical sequence in polychrome relief, dating from the 16th century. This stresses the execution and the disposal of the saint's remains.

A remarkable Pre-Raphaelite portrayal is ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]]. Here the Baptist is shown as a child, wearing a loin covering of animal skins, hurrying into [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]'s carpenter shop with a bowl of water to join [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], Joseph, and Mary's mother [[Saint Anne|Anne]] in soothing the injured hand of Jesus. Artistic interest enjoyed a considerable revival at the end of the 19th century with [[Symbolist]] painters such as [[Gustave Moreau]] and [[Puvis de Chavannes]] ([[National Gallery, London]]). [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' was illustrated by [[Aubrey Beardsley]], giving rise to some of his most memorable images.

Saint John the Baptist is the patron saint of [[Jordan]]: his beheading is said to have taken place in [[Machaerus]] in central Jordan.

Saint John the Baptist is the [[patron saint]] of the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] and its capital city, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. In 1521, the island was given its formal name, "''San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico''", following the custom of christening a town with its formal name and the name which [[Christopher Columbus]] had originally given the island. The names "''San Juan Bautista''" and "''Puerto Rico''" were eventually used in reference to both city and island, leading to a reversal in terminology by most inhabitants largely due to a [[Cartography|cartographic]] error. By 1746, the city's name ("''Puerto Rico''") had become that of the entire island, while the name for the island ("''San Juan Bautista''") had become that of the city. The [[List of U.S. state mottos|official motto]] of Puerto Rico also references the saint: ''Joannes Est Nomen Eius'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "his name is John", from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201;63&amp;version=63 Luke 1:63]).

He is also a patron saint of [[French Canada]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. The Canadian cities of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]] (1497) and [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] (1604) were both named in his honor. In the United Kingdom, Saint John is the patron of [[Penzance]], [[Cornwall]]. His feast day of June 24, celebrated officially in [[Quebec]] as the ''[[Fête Nationale du Québec]]'', and in Newfoundland as [[Discovery Day]].

In [[Scotland]], he is the patron saint of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], which used to be known as St. John's Toun of Perth. The main church in the city is still the medieval Kirk of St. John the Baptist and the city's [[Professional sports|professional]] [[football club]] is called [[St Johnstone F.C.]]

Also, on the night of June 23 on to the 24th, Saint John is celebrated as the patron saint of [[Porto]], the second largest city in [[Portugal]]. An article from June 2004 in ''[[The Guardian]]'' remarked that "Porto's [[Festa de São João]] is one of Europe's liveliest street festivals, yet it is relatively unknown outside the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Hancock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2004/jun/12/portugal.guardiansaturdaytravelsection|title=There's only one São João|work=The Guardian|date=June 12, 2004|accessdate=February 14, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also patron of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] of Jerusalem, [[Malta]], [[Florence]], and [[Genoa]], Italy. John is patron saint of [[Xewkija]], [[Gozo]], Malta, which remember him with a great feast on the Sunday nearest to June 24.

[[Calamba City, Laguna]], [[Calumpit, Bulacan]], [[Balayan, Batangas|Balayan]] and [[Lian, Batangas|Lian]] in [[Batangas (province)|Batangas]], and [[San Juan, Metro Manila]] are among several places in the [[Philippines]] that venerate John as the town or city patron. A common practise of many [[Culture of the Philippines|Filipino fiestas]] in his honour is bathing and the dousing of people in memory of John's iconic act. The custom is similar in form to [[Songkran]] and [[Holi]], and serves as a playful respite from the intense tropical heat. While famed for the [[Black Nazarene]] it enshrines, [[Quiapo Church]] in [[Manila]] is actually dedicated to Saint John.

He is also patron of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston]], which covers the whole of [[South Carolina]] in the [[United States]].

The [[Baptistines (disambiguation)|Baptistines]] are the name given to a number of [[religious orders]] dedicated to the memory of John the Baptist.

Along with [[John the Evangelist]], John the Baptist is claimed as a patron saint by the fraternal society of [[Freemasonry|Free and Accepted Masons]] (better known as the Freemasons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/ward.html|title=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry|publisher=Freemasons-freemasonry.com|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Mediterranean countries, the [[summer solstice]] is dedicated to St. John. The associated ritual is very similar to [[Midsummer]] celebrations in the Anglo-Saxon tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Kilham received his bachelor's degree in 1932 and his M.S. in biology in 1935 from [[Harvard University]] and then his M.D. in 1940 from [[Harvard Medical School]]. As an intern in Cleveland, Ohio, he married an intern, Jane K. Kilham (1912–1992). Early in WW II, husband and wife went to England, and after D-Day Lawrence Kilham served in field hospitals as a doctor in the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] under [[George Patton|Patton]]. In 1945, Lawrence Kilham returned to graduate school to do research on virology and to teach epidemiology. He was a virology researcher rom 1949 to 1960 and in 1961 he became a professor at [[Dartmouth Medical School]] (Geisel School of Medicine), retiring there as professor emeritus in 1978.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

{{quote|Lawrence Kilham was widely recognized for his research with viruses and infectious diseases, publishing nearly 150 articles and discovering a new group of viruses with single-stranded DNA. ... By the early 1950s, Lawrence was serious about birds, joining both the AOU The [[American Ornithologists' Union]] and the [[Wilson Ornithological Society]] in 1952. It was while doing viral research in Uganda in 1954–1955, that he developed a research interest in bird behavior. From that point on, his work with the behavior of birds and mammals, an avocation, became a passion that led to more than 90 publications in the ornithological and behavioral literature.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;}}

He was elected a fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1974. He was awarded the [[John Burroughs Medal]] in 1989 for his 1979 book ''On Watching Birds''.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

Lawrence Kilham died at his home in [[Lyme, New Hampshire]] on 21 Sep 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4089853?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents In Memoriam: Lawrence Kilham, 1910-2000 on JSTOR] Retrieved 2018-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt; He was predeceased by his wife&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; and a son, Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Peter Kilham 1943–1989|journal=Diatom Research|volume=5|year=1990|issue=1|author=Hecky, Robert E.|pages=209–212|doi=10.1080/0269249X.1990.9705109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by three sons, [[Ben Kilham|Benjamin]], Michael, and Joshua, and a daughter, Phoebe.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

The nectar resource in a given area depends on the kinds of flowering plants present and their blooming periods.  Which kinds grow in an area depends on soil texture, soil pH, soil drainage, daily maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, extreme minimum winter temperature, and growing degree days.  The plants listed below grow in [[USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 5.  A good predictor for when a plant will bloom and produce [[nectar]] is a calculation of the [[growing degree day]]s. [[Andrew Delmar Hopkins#Bioclimatics|Hopkins' Bioclimatic Law]] states that in North America east of the Rockies, a 130 m (400-foot) increase in elevation, a 4° change in [[latitude]] north (444.48&amp;nbsp;km), or a 10° change in [[longitude]] east (two thirds of a [[time zone]]) will cause a biological event to occur four days later in the spring or four days earlier in the fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiwc.org/hopkins.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007011440/http://www.sfiwc.org/hopkins.html |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[botany]], the term [[phenology]] refers to the timing of flower emergence, sequence of bloom, fruiting, and leaf drop in autumn.

The classification in major or minor nectar source is very dependent on the agricultural use of the land.  An agricultural crop such as canola or alfalfa may be a major or minor source depending on local plantings.  Generally, the more diverse a forage area is, the better for a stationary apiary.  Urban, suburban and areas not under cultivation provide more consistent warm-season nectar forage than areas that are heavily cultivated with only a few agricultural crops.  The nectar sources from large cultivated fields of blooming apples, cherries, canola, melons, sunflowers, clover etc. benefit a bee keeper who is willing to travel with his hives throughout the season.

[[Honeydew source]]s are not included in this listing.

|no
|feral In [[California]], spring blooming plant with repeat bloom. Fall bloom provides nectar for bees for overwintering. The most unusual feature of ''Echium vulgare'' is the protection of the nectar inside the flower from vaporization (when it's hot) or flushing away (when it rains). It is why almost for 2 months this plant is a stable source of nectar for bees. Additionally this plant produces nectar throughout the day unlike most plants which produce nectar for a short period of time. If the bees have a good access to Echium they can collect between 12–20&amp;nbsp;lbs of nectar a day. The concentration of sugars in the nectar vary 22.6–48.3% depending on the quality of the soil, and not on the amount of rain. The honey is light amber in color and very fragrant with a pleasant taste, and does not crystallize for 9–15 months.&lt;ref name=Melissa/&gt;

This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Michigan''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of November 29, 2010, there were 67 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two additional sites are currently proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  Seventeen sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

The [[United States]] [[National Historic Landmark]] Program is designed to recognize and honor the nation's cultural and historical heritage.  The program was formally inaugurated with a series of listings on October 9, 1960; as of February 16, 2017, there are 2,596 designated landmarks.  A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is generally a [[National Register of Historic Places property types|building, district, object, site, or structure]], that is officially recognized by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] for its national historical significance.  A National Historic Landmark District (NHLD) is a [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] that is recognized as an NHL.  Its geographic area may include [[contributing properties]] that are buildings, structures, sites or objects, and it may include non-contributing properties.

The program is administered by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS), a branch of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. The National Park Service determines which properties meet NHL criteria and makes nomination recommendations after an owner notification process.&lt;ref name="NHLQA"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Park Service|title=National Historic Landmarks Program: Questions and Answers|work=National Historic Landmarks Program|url=http://www.nps.gov/nhl/QA.htm|accessdate=September 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NHL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation.&lt;ref name="Title36"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_98/36cfr65_98.html|title= Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 65|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office|US Government Printing Office]]|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both public and privately owned properties can be designated as NHLs. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties via tax incentives, grants, monitoring of threats, and other means.&lt;ref name="NHLQA"/&gt; Owners may object to the nomination of the property as a NHL. When this is the case the Secretary of the Interior can only designate a site as eligible for designation.&lt;ref name="Title36"/&gt;

All NHLs are also included on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP), a list of some 80,000 historic properties that the National Park Service deems to be worthy of recognition. The primary difference between a NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have national significance, while other NRHP properties are deemed significant at the local or state level.&lt;ref name="NHLQA"/&gt;

==Tabular listing==
Most landmark designations are in one of the [[List of U.S. states|50 states]].  [[List of National Historic Landmarks in New York|New York]] is the state with the most (270), and [[List of National Historic Landmarks in New York City|New York City]], with 114 designations, is the city with the largest number of designations.  Of the states, [[List of National Historic Landmarks in North Dakota|North Dakota]] has the fewest designations with seven.  Three cities (New York City, [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], and [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Boston|Boston]]) have enough listings to warrant lists separate from their respective states.

A small number of designations have been made outside the 50 states.  Most of these appear in [[Insular area|United States possessions]].  The [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] have five listings, [[Puerto Rico]] has four, and island possessions in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] have six.  Five listings are found in Pacific island nations with which the U.S. has established a [[Insular area#Freely associated states|free association agreement]], and one listing, the [[American Legation]] in [[Tangier]] (the nation's first foreign public property), is found in the unaffiliated [[Kingdom of Morocco]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18742">From 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1518556|title=Iceland the First Country to Try Abandoning Gasoline|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=18 January 2006|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; an expanding list of countries have proposed and later decided to ban the future sale of passenger vehicles powered by so-called [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] such as [[Gasoline|gasoline]] ("gas" or "petrol"), [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. The intent to ban vehicles powered by fossil fuels is attractive to governments as it offers simpler [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/0930_compliance_weaver.pdf target compliance] compared with more encompassing [[Fossil fuel phase-out|phase-out of fossil fuels]]. Currently, the most up-to-date survey comes from the [https://climateprotection.org/ Center for Climate Protection] entitled "[https://climateprotection.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Survey-on-Global-Activities-to-Phase-Out-ICE-Vehicles-FINAL-Oct-3-2018.pdf Survey of Global Activity to Phase Out Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles]"

== Motivation ==
Various reasons are cited for banning further sale of fossil fuelled vehicles, including energy independence, [[Diesel_exhaust#Health_concerns|health risk]] due to emissions and processing, reduced [[Low-carbon power|carbon footprint]], efficiency and other factors.

== Taxonomy ==
References in mainstream media to these bans also use terms or phrases like "banning gas cars",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/countries-banning-gas-cars-2017-10//|title=These countries are banning gas-powered vehicles by 2040|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "banning ICE cars" ([[Internal_combustion_engine|Internal Combustion Engine]]), or "banning petrol cars"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/30/as-other-countries-give-petrol-cars-an-end-date-is-australian-being-left-behind|title=As the UK plans to phase out petrol cars, is Australia being left behind?|first=Michael|last=Slezak|date=30 July 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Scope ==
The so-called "banning" of fossil fuels vehicles has a defined scope and is generally applied in the form of a legislated decision to restrict further sales or registration of new vehicles powered with specific fuels from a future date. At the date of implementation current vehicles would still be registrable. As at 2017, most bans are over 10-years into the future and are not yet legislated.

== Industry Involvement in Promoting Electric Vehicles&lt;ref name="climateprotection.org"&gt;https://climateprotection.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Survey-on-Global-Activities-to-Phase-Out-ICE-Vehicles-FINAL-Oct-3-2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ==
To meet future demand for EVs, auto manufacturers need to plan and gear up for the relevant changes to design and manufacturing processes. Normally, government calls for reduced vehicle emissions are met with resistance from the private sector. According to Winfried Hermann, transport minister for Stuttgart, "We say, clean up your technology, they say it is impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/world/europe/diesel-driving-ban-germany-stuttgart.html|title=In Germany’s Car Capital, the Unthinkable: The Right to Ban Cars|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many automakers are now planning to sell most of their vehicle fleet in electric versions. According to Volvo’s CEO, the manufacturer aims for 50 percent of sales to be fully electric by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2018/04/25/volvo-electrification-plan-fully-electric/|title=Volvo clarifies electrification plan, aims for 50% of sales to be ‘fully electric’ by 2025|date=25 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies including BMW and Renault have committed to significant increases in EV production in the next two years and plan on a full transition in the near future. The PSA Group, which owns Peugeot and Citroen, stated its intentions to electrify 80 percent of its fleet for production by 2023, and Toyota is manufacturing its first fully electrified Prius to meet California’s updated vehicle standards for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/these-countries-want-ban-all-vehicles-run-gas-or-diesel-n781431|title=Adieu! France is the latest to consider banning gas-powered vehicles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyota also announced it will be adding more than 10 EV models by the early 2020s, and has partnered with Panasonic to develop a new EV battery.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-electric-factbox/factbox-automakers-put-pedal-to-the-metal-on-electric- vehicles-idUSKBN1GX2RH&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that have already produced fully electrified cars, such as Nissan, are setting the pace by providing more variety to make EVs appealing to consumers with diverse needs. Aston Martin, Jaguar, and Land Rover, producers of luxury cars, have also spoken publicly about their company goals to move toward electrifying vehicles.&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/general-motors-electric-cars-plan-gm/|title=General Motors Is Going All Electric|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; German-owned makers of Rolls-Royce and Mini Cooper vehicles plan to bring 25 electric models to market by 2025, in line with the goals that several European countries have targeted for the end of new ICE vehicle sales.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Additionally, they hope to stay ahead of shifting market demands and the impending European target goals by increasing research and development spending to 7 billion euros.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The largest auto manufacturer in Europe, Volkswagen, has pledged 20 billion euros for its electric car program, and its luxury brand Porsche, in collaboration with Audi, will release 20 electrified models by 2025.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Ford Motors and General Motors are also taking the extra step to significantly invest in production efforts. In January 2018, the chairman of Ford announced that the company would more than double their investment in EV production, up to $11 billion, and have 40 models ready for production by 2022, addressing a wide variety of consumers’ aesthetic and logistical needs.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/15/ford-to-invest-11bn-and-have-40-hybrid-and-fully- electric-vehicles-by-2022&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen of the 40 models will function as fully electric cars. In the case of General Motors, one of the largest automotive manufacturers in the world, company leadership aims to produce 18 battery electric cars and fuel cell-powered vehicles by 2023, two of which will come out this year. The company has already opened its market for EVs in China, where General Motors reported selling more cars than it did in the United States in 2017. In the summer of 2017, “it started selling a two-seat EV there, for just $5,300."&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; Pressure from regulators in China, Europe, and California to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels is partially responsible for the shift in attitude at these major companies.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; Other influential forces include "Tesla Inc.’s success in creating electric sedans and SUVs that inspire would-be owners to line up outside showrooms and flood the company with orders."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Fiat-Chrysler claims to be "going after Tesla," producing four electrified Maserati models by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2018/07/10/fca-going-after-tesla-new-ev-plan/|title=‘We’re going after Tesla’, says Fiat-Chrysler with their new EV plan|date=10 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automotive manufacturers are not the only corporate presence that make a significant impact on EV adoption. Other industries that use predominantly fossil fuel-powered vehicles, such as trucking and transportation services, would send crucial market signals by demonstrating a greater willingness to use electric trucks and other emission-free technologies. A Council on Foreign Relations article describes major corporations acting as EV and green technology consumers as exhibiting "corporate responsibility." The article also draws a parallel to the success of corporate and public commitment to investment in renewables. "When large corporates [such as Google and Apple announcing their intent to run on 100 percent renewables] publicly committed to investing in renewables, states and cities competed to adopt clean energy policies to attract investment, leading corporates to invest billions in renewables across the country." A similar opportunity exists for clean cars. Ride-hailing, an industry entirely reliant on personal car ownership, has recognized the opportunity to incentivize and encourage EV adoption. Lyft, for example, has announced their intention to provide one billion rides per year in EVs. Uber, meanwhile, is incentivizing the switch to EVs by offering to pay more to participating drivers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cfr.org/blog/what-states- cities-and-corporations-can-do-face-federal-resistance-clean-transportation&lt;/ref&gt; In the logistics world, UPS is involved in an ongoing effort to electrify its entire London fleet (170 trucks), which includes developing a smart schedule for charging the trucks so that the grid remains stable. They are also moving to electrify 1,500 trucks in their New York fleet.&lt;ref&gt;https://electrek.co/2018/03/30/end-internal-combustion-engine-says-ups-fleet- to-electric/&lt;/ref&gt; While industries on both the supply and demand side of EV uptake have legacies of reliance on the fossil fuel industry to overcome, these big names have a prime opportunity to set a meaningful example for other companies as well as individuals.

[[File:Mount Hood reflected in Mirror Lake, Oregon.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mount Hood]] is the highest summit of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Oregon|State of Oregon]].]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Oregon|State of Oregon]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in this article include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 30 highest major summits of Oregon by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 30 most prominent summits of Oregon.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 30 most isolated major summits of Oregon.
__TOC__{{clear}}

==Highest major summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
Of the highest major summits of Oregon, five peaks exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation and 24 peaks exceed {{convert|2500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.

===Coastal rivers of [[Goa]]===
* Tiracol
* Chapora
* Baga
* [[Mandovi River]]
[[Mandovi River]], known as Mhadai in [[Western Ghats]] of [[Goa]] and [[Karnataka]], has three sources: the Degao, the Nanevadichi Nhõi (nhõi means river in Konkani) and Gavali; the last two sources go dry in summer season. The main origin of the river, in the form of a spring, even during Summer season, is at Bavtyacho Dongor hills near Degao village in Khanapur Taluka of [[Belgaum Dist]] in [[Karnataka State]].

The three streams confluence at the Kabnali village whereafter it is known as Mhadai, which has an easterly flow initially, then flows north and finally turns to the west on entering Goa. Mhadai River enters Goa between [[Krishnapura|Krisnapur]] (Karnataka) and Kadval (Goa) villages. The tributaries of the Mhadai are the Nersa Nala, the Chapoli and Kapoli nala, the Bail Nala, the Volo Panshiro ( Karnataka), the Suko Panshiro, the Harparo, the Nanodyachi Nhõi, the Vellsachi Nhõi, the Valpoichi Nhõi, the Ghadghadyachi Nhõi, the Valvanti/ Volvot, the Divcholchi Nhõi, the Asnoddchi Nhõi, the Khandeaparchi Nhõi, the Mhapxechi Nhõi, Xinkerchi Nhõi etc. It is the longest River of Goa with a reported length of 105&amp;nbsp;km.

[[Image:StonerWohlfarthMainLoop.svg|thumb|right|400px|[[Stoner–Wohlfarth model|Theoretical model]] of [[magnetization]] {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;}} against [[magnetic field]]  {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;}}. Starting at the origin, the upward curve is the ''initial magnetization curve''. The downward curve after saturation, along with the lower return curve, form the ''main loop''. The intercepts {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the ''[[coercivity]]'' and ''[[remanence#Saturation remanence|saturation remanence]]''. ]]

'''Magnetic hysteresis''' occurs when an external [[magnetic field]] is applied to a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]] such as [[iron]] and the atomic [[dipole]]s align themselves with it. Even when the field is removed, part of the alignment will be retained: the material has become ''magnetized''. Once magnetized, the magnet will stay magnetized indefinitely. To [[Magnet#Demagnetizing ferromagnets|demagnetize]] it requires heat or a magnetic field in the opposite direction. This is the effect that provides the element of memory in a [[hard disk drive]].

The relationship between field strength {{math|&lt;var&gt;H&lt;/var&gt;}} and magnetization {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}}  is not linear in such materials. If a magnet is demagnetized ({{math|&lt;var&gt;H{{=}}M{{=}}0&lt;/var&gt;}}) and the relationship between {{math|&lt;var&gt;H&lt;/var&gt;}} and  {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}}  is plotted for increasing levels of field strength,  {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}} follows the ''initial magnetization curve''. This curve increases rapidly at first and then approaches an [[asymptote]] called [[Saturation (magnetic)|magnetic saturation]]. If the magnetic field is now reduced monotonically, {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}} follows a different curve.  At zero field strength, the magnetization is offset from the origin by an amount called the [[remanence]]. If the {{math|&lt;var&gt;H-M&lt;/var&gt;}} relationship is plotted for all strengths of applied magnetic field the result is a [[hysteresis]] loop called the ''main loop''. The width of the middle section along the H axis is twice the [[coercivity]] of the material.&lt;ref name=Chikazumi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chikazumi|first1=Sōshin|title=Physics of ferromagnetism|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191569852|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=Chapter 1}}

A closer look at a magnetization curve generally reveals a series of small, random jumps in magnetization called [[Barkhausen effect|Barkhausen jumps]]. This effect is due to [[crystallographic defect]]s such as [[dislocation]]s.&lt;ref name=Chikazumi/&gt;{{rp|at=Chapter 15}}

Magnetic hysteresis loops are not exclusive to materials with ferromagnetic ordering. Other magnetic orderings, such as [[spin glass]] ordering, also exhibit this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monod |first1=P. |last2=Prejean |first2=J. J. |last3=Tissier |first3=B. |year=1979 |title=Magnetic hysteresis of CuMn in the spin glass state |journal=J. Appl.

==Physical origin==

{{Main|Ferromagnetism}}
The phenomenon of hysteresis in [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials is the result of two effects: rotation of [[magnetization]] and changes in size or number of [[magnetic domain]]s. In general, the magnetization varies (in direction but not magnitude) across a magnet, but in sufficiently small magnets, it doesn't. In these [[Single domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] magnets, the magnetization responds to a magnetic field by rotating. Single-domain magnets are used wherever a strong, stable magnetization is needed (for example, [[magnetic recording]]).

Larger magnets are divided into regions called ''domains''. Within each domain, the magnetization does not vary; but between domains are relatively thin ''domain walls'' in which the direction of magnetization rotates from the direction of one domain to another. If the magnetic field changes, the walls move, changing the relative sizes of the domains. Because the domains are not magnetized in the same direction, the [[magnetic moment]] per unit volume is smaller than it would be in a single-domain magnet; but domain walls involve rotation of only a small part of the magnetization, so it is much easier to change the magnetic moment. The magnetization can also change by addition or subtraction of domains (called ''nucleation'' and ''denucleation'').

==Models==
The most known empirical models in hysteresis are [[Preisach model of hysteresis|Preisach]] and [[Jiles-Atherton model]]s. These models allow an accurate modeling of the hysteresis loop and are widely used in the industry. However, these models lose the connection with thermodynamics and the energy consistency is not ensured. Latest models rely on a consistent thermodynamic formulation. VINCH model&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Francois-Lavet et al (2011-11-14). [http://vincent.francois-l.be/VINCH_model.pdf Vectorial Incremental Nonconservative Consistent Hysteresis model].&lt;/ref&gt; is inspired by the [[Work hardening|kinematic hardening]] laws and by the [[thermodynamics]] of [[irreversible process]]es. In particular, in addition to provide an accurate modeling, the stored magnetic energy and the dissipated energy are known at all times. The obtained incremental formulation is variationally consistent; i.e., all internal variables follow from the minimization of a thermodynamic potential. That allows to obtain easily a vectorial model while Preisach and Jiles-Atherton are fundamentally scalar models.

==Applications==
{{Main|Magnet#Common uses}}

There are a great variety of applications of the hysteresis in ferromagnets. Many of these make use of their ability to retain a memory, for example [[magnetic tape]], [[hard disks]], and [[credit card]]s. In these applications, ''hard'' magnets (high coercivity) like [[iron]] are desirable so the memory is not easily erased. 

''Soft'' magnets (low coercivity) are used as cores in [[electromagnet]]s. The nonlinear response of the magnetic moment to a magnetic field boosts the response of the coil wrapped around it. The low coercivity reduces that energy loss associated with hysteresis.

Magnetic hysteresis material (soft nickel-iron rods) has been used in damping the angular motion of satellites in low earth orbit since the dawn of the space age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnetic Hysteresis Damping of Satellite Attitude Motion|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/610465.pdf|publisher=General Electric Spacecraft Department|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Global Country headquarters.JPG|thumb|A commercial building constructed using the principles and features of MVA]]

'''Maharishi Vastu Architecture''' (MVA) is a set of architectural and planning principles assembled by [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] based on "ancient Sanskrit texts".&lt;ref name=Argus&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_08_05_RockIsArgus_ltr.pdf Welvaert, Brandy, Vedic homes seek better living through architecture", ''Rock Island Argus'', (August 5, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spivack/&gt; Maharishi Vastu Architecture is also called "Maharishi [[Sthapatya Veda]]", "Fortune-Creating" buildings and homes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharishivastu.org/ Official Web site, Maharishi Vastu Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Maharishi Vedic architecture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedicarchitecture.org/ Maharishi Vedic Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

MVA has strict rules governing the orientation and proportions of a building.&lt;ref name=Toner&gt;{{cite news|title=Houses that boost health and wealth|first=Niall |last=Toner|work=Sunday Times|location=London (UK)|date=July 22, 2007|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important factor is the entrance, which must be either due east or due north.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; The MVA architect also considers the slope and shape of the lot, exposure to the rising sun, location of nearby bodies of water and the other buildings or activities in the nearby environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_07_AAAMag_ltr.pdf Egenes, Linda "Spotlight: Maharishi Vedic City", ''AAA Magazine'' (July 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; MVA emphasizes the use of natural or "green" building materials.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

MVA homes are marketed in the US by Maharishi Global Construction, LLC,&lt;ref name=Hutchinson/&gt; and by MVA Homes in the UK, both arms of the [[Transcendental Meditation movement]].&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; Several communities around the world have been developed using MVA principles. The plans for [[#Peace Tower project|Peace Tower]], which would have been the world's tallest building, followed MVA specifications.

==Principles and effects==
According to [[#Maharishi Global Construction|Maharishi Global Construction]] (MGC) in [[Fairfield, Iowa]], building a home according to the principles of MVA "connects the individual intelligence of the occupant of the house to the cosmic intelligence of the universe".&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_09_TimesJourCont.pdf Times Journal of Construction and Design, In Accord With Nature, Niranjan Mudholkar, September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of MVA say its basis is in the [[Vedas]], 5,000-year-old Sanskrit texts that assert a connection between human health and building materials, orientation to the movements of the sun and spatial relationships.&lt;ref name=Spivack/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Way"/&gt; According to Lipman, Vedic architecture and [[feng shui]] have a common root, but MVA is more scientific, while feng shui has superstitious elements.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt; Lipman says that MVA is derived from "lost and misunderstood" principles, natural law, "whereby the entire universe is created: galaxies, planets, human beings" along with buildings and cities.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

Craig Pearson, Executive Vice President of [[Maharishi University of Management]] (MUM), claims that spending time in buildings that follow these principles makes one smarter.&lt;ref name=Willdorf&gt;{{cite journal|title=Karma and wrecking balls|first=Nina|last=Willdorf|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|location=Washington|date=June 2, 2000|volume=46|issue=39|page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that MVA homes have escaped wildfires that burned neighboring homes, and that businesses located in MVA office buildings have greater profit and lower absenteeism.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; Residents of MVA homes in [[Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa]] claim they felt vitality, calm and happiness when they moved into their Vedic houses. A mother claims that her boys are more orderly.&lt;ref name=Balachandran/&gt; Maharishi Mahesh Yogi has said, "Living in a proper vastu can eliminate 60 to 80 percent of the problems we encounter in life."&lt;ref name=Balachandran&gt;{{cite news|title=Vedic city: A city in the US follows building principles set in the Vedas|first=R. |last=Balachandran|date=September 9, 2001|work=The Week (Indian magazine)|location=Kerala, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Warburton, Raja of England, says that the practice of Maharishi’s Vedic peace technologies is more powerful with Vastu buildings.&lt;ref name=Warburton/&gt; Yale University architecture professor [[Keller Easterling]] says that MVA is fueled by a desire to create outposts for broadcasting the [[Maharishi Effect]].&lt;ref name=Easterling/&gt;

Maharishi Sthapatya Veda is considered to be an element of the [[Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health]], and the main modality of MVAH for improving the immediate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Schneider| first1 = Robert H. | last2 = Fields| first2 = Jeremy Z. | title = Total heart health : how to prevent and reverse heart disease with the maharishi vedic approach to health | year = 2006 | publisher = Basic Health Publications | location = Laguna Beach, CA | isbn = 978-1-59120-087-1 | pages=64, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siting===
Auspicious locations have water to the east or north.&lt;ref name=Easterling/&gt; If water is in an inauspicious location then it can be balanced with fountains on the north side.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt; Items in the nearby environment that generate electro-magnetic fields, such as high tension wires and microwave towers, are avoided.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The slope, if any, should be towards the east, and there should be no obstructions that block the sun's first rays.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt;

===Orientation===
[[File:Maharishi Centre for Educational Excellence, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India..jpg|thumb|left|350px|MCEE School Campus at Bhopal, India, '''facing due east''']]
The principles of orientation in Maharishi Sthapatya Veda are based on the position of the sun, considered by MVA to be the most powerful natural influence on Earth.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt; Aligning a structure with the rising sun (facing east) is considered by MVA adherents to be auspicious for the building's inhabitants and to be "spiritually healthy."&lt;ref name=Aspan&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Aspan| first = Maria| title = Maharishi’s Minions Come to Wall Street| work = The New York Times| accessdate=December 17, 2009 |date = 2007-07-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/business/worldbusiness/02maharishi.html?_r=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the principles of MVA, the other three cardinal directions also have their corresponding influences. For example, homes with entrances facing west invite "poverty, lack of creativity and vitality,"&lt;ref name="Kansas City Star"&gt;Canon, Scott, "Maharishi's followers have integrated into small Iowa town" ''Kansas City Star'', (September 28, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and "anxiety, depression, bad luck and even criminal tendencies."&lt;ref name="rickross.com"&gt;"Reclusive Guru's in Battle to Demolish Historic Dutch Monastery" ''Associated Press'', January 20, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; According to the MVA official website, the north direction has the influence of prosperity and happiness and the south direction has the influence of negativity, problems and suffering.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Proper orientation is also said to increase business productivity.

===Placement===
When a house for a particular individual is being designed using MVA principles, the placement of the building and its rooms are carefully planned according to their intended usage and the influence of the sun as it moves throughout the day.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Way"&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_07_22_AmericanWay_ltr.pdf Kissel, William "Home and Peace", ''American Way'' (July 15 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; Rooms are placed to "take in the sun's light as it passes overhead." Windows and skylights are also used to allow as much natural sunlight as possible to enter the building.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt; An aspect of MVA called "Vastu Vidya" determines the places in the building that are used for generating and storing natural elements like fire and water, heating and plumbing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Bathroom fixtures such as sinks and mirrors also have a particular placement according to MVA rules;&lt;ref name=ArchImpressions/&gt; Toilets have a particular direction depending on the Vastu design&lt;ref name=Hutchinson&gt;{{cite news|title=Wasting away in Maharishi-ville|first=Brian |last=Hutchinson|work=National Post|location=Don Mills, Ont.|date= February 22, 2003|page=B.1.Fro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchens and dining rooms should be on the east side, and offices on the west.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt;  commercial buildings are often designed as linear "bar buildings" to offer the most east-facing exposure.&lt;ref name=Easterling/&gt;

===Proportion===
MVA says that symmetry is orderly and helps to coordinate the various aspects of a structure, and that there is an ideal proportion for every room in a home or office. Also, the length, width and elevation of the building are calculated using the ancient Vedic mathematical formulas and requires a level of construction precision to one-eighth of an inch.&lt;ref name=ArchImpressions/&gt;

MVA planning and building takes into account the effects of the sun, moon, planets and stars, and also using the poles and the equator as reference points.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Its measurements and proportions are said to be calculated in reference to proportions of the human physiology and the cosmos, and in harmony with nature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Features===
[[File:Maharishi Headquarters in Holland- cropped.jpg|thumb|A ''kalash'' atop a ''Brahmasthan'', with the flag of the [[Global Country of World Peace]], on the Maharishi's HQ in Vlodrop.]]
One of the features of MVA design is the ''[[Brahmasthan]]'', whose literal translation is "establish wholeness". The ''Brahmasthan'' is a central space "lit by a skylight" that serves as a "silent core" and is "never walked on".&lt;ref name="American Way"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/transcendental-meditation-vedic-city-iowa/story?id=9218475 Berman, John and Burbank, Maggie, "Transcendental Meditation thrives in Iowa", ''ABC News'' (January 8 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmastan'' is said to act as the "nucleus" or axis point for the structure like the nucleus of a cell or an atom.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Way"/&gt;

Other features include a perimeter designation called a ''vastu'' fence. This boundary line may consist of shrubs or a metal, stone or wood fence. It is ideally about {{convert|30|ft|m}} away from the front and back of the building and eight feet away from the sides.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; Another feature is a "small, golden, roof ornament" or [[cupola]], called a ''[[Kalasha|kalash]]'', which one MVA architect says improves the connection between the residents and heaven.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hutchinson/&gt; A defined plinth is another standard element.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; Color is also covered by MVA.&lt;ref name=Paradkar&gt;{{cite news|title=Before feng shui, there was vastu shastra; Indian science has formulas to align a home with nature Interiors, decor can be modified to best advantage|first=Bageshree |last=Paradkar|work=Toronto Star|date=March 10, 2005|page=J.06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ceremonies====
Three "special ceremonies" performed on "auspicious dates" are recommended by MVA. These include a ground breaking, which is described as digging a precise square hole while facing east, adding organic fertilizer and "sacred water" from India, and making statements of goodwill and success for the new construction. The second ceremony is the laying of the cornerstone and the third is moving-in.&lt;ref name=ArchImpressions&gt;Architectural Impressions, 2005 Edition, the Maharishi Vedic Center, Alan Sullivan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials===
MVA buildings should not contain any iron or steel.&lt;ref name=TMB91&gt;{{cite news|title=Details of World's Most Advanced 'Sustainable' and 'Fortune-Creating' Building |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=September 2008 |url=http://www.tmbulletin.com/Volume9/TMBulletinV9I01.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717063738/http://www.tmbulletin.com/Volume9/TMBulletinV9I01.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MVA emphasizes the use of natural or "green" building materials such as wood, bricks, adobe, rammed earth, clay, stucco and marble. Other natural fibers such as wood, paper, cotton and wool are used in the interior.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The use of natural materials, along with spacious plots and layouts, mean that MVA homes can be expensive, according to the MGC sales director, Eloise Raymond.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt;

==Global Reconstruction==
The Maharishi's Global Reconstruction Program for Permanent World Peace entails replacing the existing cities and buildings of the world with plans and structures that follow MVA principles. The project is estimated by the Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) Finance Minister to cost $300 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press-conference.globalgoodnews.com/archive/january/06-01-18.html |title=Maharishi Press Conference Highlights |publisher=globalgoodnews.com |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A goal of the MGDF is to achieve "heaven on earth".&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; The Director of the Global Country of World Peace's [[Global Country of World Peace#Financial Capital|Financial Capital]], Paul Potter, said "we hope to be able to rebuild the whole world to be fortune-oriented buildings, to be heaven on earth".&lt;ref name=Aspan/&gt;

MVA principles were mandated in the platform of the Maharishi's "Invincible India Party" ([[Ajeya Bharat Party]]).&lt;ref name=ZUBRZYCKI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Maharishi at 80: Yogi in the sky with diamonds: A pyramid in India, the tallest building in the world, is among the projects planned by devotees.|first=Mian |last=Ridge|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=August 6, 1999|page=A.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CONGRESS GETS JOLT IN MADHYA PRADESH|work= The Hindustan Times|location=New Delhi|date=November 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, it called for an overhaul of building laws to require all new buildings to comply with MVA.&lt;ref name=ZUBRZYCKI&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcendental election aim|first=JOHN |last=ZUBRZYCKI |work=South China Morning Post|location=Hong Kong|date= February 12, 1998|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month after its 2001 founding, the [[Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa]], the council passed a resolution saying that city planning should be in accord with MVA principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s61YmJor?url=http://www.maharishivediccity.com/council/resolutions/06.html |archivedate=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |title=Resolution No. 6: To create a Master Plan for Maharishi Vedic City incorporating all the knowledge of Veda and the Vedic literature to create a model city of peace, prosperity, happiness for the citizens, and ideal administration, and through the creation of this ideal city to bring the benefits of peace and prosperity to the State of Iowa, the United States and the world |publisher=MAHARISHI VEDIC CITY CITY COUNCIL |date=December 28, 2001 |url=http://www.maharishivediccity.com/council/resolutions/06.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 document from the Maharishi Global Development Fund outlines a proposed method for cities to transition to Vastu buildings. The first phase is "controlling the expansion of the city by establishing a masterplan with parallel roads in east/west, north/south directions". The second phase is "construction of ideal villages and satellite towns around the city, free from pollution". The third is "starting to demolish congested areas in the city center, replacing them with beautiful gardens, parks and fountains". The fourth is "final stage of the expanded garden city, providing ideal living conditions, including a modern communication and transportation system".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite news|work=Dallas Business Journal|date=May 5, 2000|volume=23|issue=37|page=1|title=Maharishi eyes Colony project|first1=LISA Y.|last1=TAYLOR|first2=CHRISTINE |last2=PEREZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maharishi said that "improperly oriented" building should be demolished, including the [[White House]] and the [[United Nations Headquarters|U.N. Building]].&lt;ref name=Koppel/&gt; He is quoted as saying that national leaders should vacate inauspicious buildings immediately, "as if an earthquake had hit them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the Cape city council is going south... |first=John |last=Yeld|date=August 29, 2005| url= http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20050829110927675C207743 | page= 1 |work=Cape Argus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=August 25, 2005 |title= Exhibits A and B |authorlink=John McCaslin|first=John |last=McCaslin|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/JohnMcCaslin/2005/08/25/exhibits_a_and_b|accessdate=August 1, 2010|publisher=townhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMB&gt;{{cite news|volume=5|issue=12|date=August 2005|work=TM Bulletin|publisher=Maharishi Health Education Center|location=Lebanon|title=Examine the Layout of All Government Buildings|url=http://www.tmbulletin.net/volume5/TMBulletinV5I12.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmbulletin.net%2Fvolume5%2FTMBulletinV5I12.htm&amp;date=2010-08-02|archivedate=August 2, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he ordered numerous TM centers around the world to close due to inauspicious locations.&lt;ref name=Piccalo&gt;{{cite news|title=Good vibes; Maharishi Mahesh Yogi plans to promote world harmony from a soon-to-be-built 'palace' in L.A.

He designated 2006 as the "Year of Reconstruction for the Whole World to be Heaven on Earth". The following year he included reconstruction in his seven-point plan for creating "invincibility for every nation". According to the Maharishi, "All the problems of the world will go away with our Global Reconstruction Programme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maharishi's Achievements 1957–2008|url=http://www.mmyvv.com/machieve2.jsp|publisher=mmyvv.com|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the world reconstruction program, as they appeared in movement newsletter in 2005, includes buildings such as:&lt;ref name=TMB/&gt;

In the decade prior to 2005, about $250 million was spent on the construction of Maharishi Sthapatya Veda buildings, according to the ''[[Media in the Quad Cities#Print|Rock Island Argus]]''. About a third of that construction took place in the town of [[Fairfield, Iowa]].&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;

==Reception==
After hearing a presentation on MVA at the [[National Building Museum]] in 2005, a ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter said that "non-adherents" may find the principles "eccentric, to say the least," as houses not facing east or north are said by MVA adherents to be "practically begging inauspicious forces to sweep in and wreak havoc." The reporter goes on to say that many architects would not "quibble" with other components of MVA such as "balance and symmetry", a vastu fence or wall and "solar influenced" placement of rooms in the home.&lt;ref name=Turrentine&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/06/AR2005070600611.html Turrentine, Jeff , "Mind over mortar", ''Washington Post'' (July 7 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' travel writer Carina Chocano writes that Maharishi Vedic City "displays all the architectural characteristics of a new exurban development: gaudy, oversize construction that has no stylistic relation to its environment but instead vaguely alludes to a theme-park version, someplace sort of magical and far away."&lt;ref name=Chocano&gt;[http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-tr-vedic10sep10?page=1 Chocano, Carina, "Meditation comes with creature comforts at Iowa's Maharishi University", ''Los Angeles Times'' (September 10, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

19th century German philosopher [[Karl Marx]], the founder and primary theorist of [[Marxism]], had an antithetical and complex attitude to [[religion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lobkowicz|first1=N.|journal=Review of Politics|title=|date=1964|volume=26|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; viewing it primarily as "the soul of soulless conditions", the "[[opium of the people]]" that had been useful to the ruling classes since it gave the [[working class]]es false hope for millennia. At the same time, Marx saw religion as a form of protest by the working classes against their poor economic conditions and their alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Raines, John. 2002. "Introduction". ''Marx on Religion'' (Marx, Karl). Philadelphia: Temple University Press. Page 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] interpretation of Marxist theory, primarily developed by [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] revolutionary and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]], religion is seen as retarding human development. Due to this, a number of Marxist–Leninist governments in the 20th century, such as the [[Soviet Union]] after [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]], implemented rules introducing [[state atheism]].

== Karl Marx on religion ==
{{see also|Opium of the people}}
[[Karl Marx]]'s religious views have been the subject of much interpretation. He famously stated in ''[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'': {{quote|Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.

The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.

Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm#05|publisher=Marxist Internet Archive|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Howard Zinn]], Marx "saw religion, not just negatively as 'the opium of the people,' but positively as the 'sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, the soul of soulless conditions.' This helps us understand the mass appeal of the religious charlatans of the television screen, as well as the work of Liberation Theology in joining the soulfulness of religion to the energy of revolutionary movements in miserably poor countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=Howard Zinn: On Marx and Marxism|url=http://kasamaproject.org/history/1961-93howard-zinn-on-marx-and-marxism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent scholarship has suggested that "opium of the people" is itself a dialectical metaphor, a "protest" and an "expression" of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2005). 'Reading ‘Opium of the People’: Expression, Protest and the Dialectics of Religion'. Critical Sociology, vol 31, no. 1-2, pp. 15-38 [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf "Opium as Dialectics of Religion: Metaphor, Expression and Protest"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roland Boer in International Socialism. Issue 123 [http://isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=560&amp;issue=123 "The full story: on Marxism and religion"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Certainly, Marx did not object to a spiritual life. Rather, he thought it was necessary. In the "Wages of Labour" (1844), Marx wrote: "To develop in greater spiritual freedom, a people must break their bondage to their bodily needs—they must cease to be the slaves of the body. They must, above all, have time at their disposal for spiritual creative activity and spiritual enjoyment."

== Vladimir Lenin on religion ==
[[Vladimir Lenin]] was highly critical of religion, saying in his book ''Religion'': &lt;blockquote&gt;Atheism is a natural and inseparable part of Marxism, of the theory and practice of scientific socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | id = 
  | isbn = 9781408633205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Attitude of the Workers’ Party to Religion'', he wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Religion is the [[opium of the people]]: this saying of Marx is the cornerstone of the entire ideology of Marxism about  religion. All modern religions and churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, while Lenin was critical of religion, he also specifically made a point to not include it in ''Our Programme'' or his ideological goals by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;But under no circumstances ought we to fall into the error of posing the religious question in an abstract, idealistic fashion, as an “intellectual” question unconnected with the class struggle, as is not infrequently done by the radical-democrats from among the bourgeoisie. It would be stupid to think that, in a society based on the endless oppression and coarsening of the worker masses, religious prejudices could be dispelled by purely propaganda methods. It would be bourgeois narrow-mindedness to forget that the yoke of religion that weighs upon mankind is merely a product and reflection of the economic yoke within society. No number of pamphlets and no amount of preaching can enlighten the proletariat, if it is not enlightened by its own struggle against the dark forces of capitalism. Unity in this really revolutionary struggle of the oppressed class for the creation of a paradise on earth is more important to us than unity of proletarian opinion on paradise in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Nikolai Bukharin and Evgenii Preobrazhensky on religion ==
In their influential book ''[[The ABC of Communism]]'', [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Evgenii Preobrazhensky]] spoke out strongly against religion. "Communism is incompatible with religious faith", they wrote.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite book|title=The ABC of Communism|last=Bukharin|first=Nikolai|last2=Preobrazhensky|first2=Evgenii|publisher=|year=1920|isbn=9780472061129|location=|chapter=Chapter 11: Communism and Religion|doi=|id=|authorlink=|chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/11.htm|title-link=The ABC of Communism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, importance was placed on secularism and non-violence towards the religious: &lt;blockquote&gt;But the campaign against the backwardness of the masses in this matter of religion, must be conducted with patience and considerateness, as well as with energy and perseverance. The credulous crowd is extremely sensitive to anything which hurts its feelings. To thrust atheism upon the masses, and in conjunction therewith to interfere forcibly with religious practices and to make mock of the objects of popular reverence, would not assist but would hinder the campaign against religion. If the church were to be persecuted, it would win sympathy among the masses, for persecution would remind them of the almost forgotten days when there was an association between religion and the defence of national freedom; it would strengthen the antisemitic movement; and in general it would mobilize all the vestiges of an ideology which is already beginning to die out.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Religion in the Soviet Union ===
{{main|Religion in the Soviet Union}}
The [[Soviet Union]] was an [[State atheism|atheist state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Protest for Religious Rights in the USSR: Characteristics and Consequences|journal=The Russian Review|volume=39|issue=4|pages=426–441|jstor=128810|last1=Kowalewski|first1=David|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina Petra Ramet, Ed., Religious Policy in the Soviet Union. Cambridge University Press (1993). P 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Anderson, Religion, State and Politics in the Soviet Union and Successor States, Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 3&lt;/ref&gt; in which religion was largely discouraged and at times heavily persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/anti.html "Anti-religious Campaigns"].&lt;/ref&gt; According to various Soviet and Western sources, over one-third of the country's people still professed religious belief ([[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] had the most believers). Christians belonged to various churches: [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]], which had the largest number of followers; [[Catholicism|Catholic]]; and [[Baptist]] and other [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]]. The majority of the Islamic faithful were [[Sunni]] while [[Judaism]] also had many followers. Other religions, which were practiced by a relatively small number of believers, included [[Buddhism]] and [[Shamanism]].  However it should be noted that after 1941 in the stalin era , religious persecution was greatly reduced. To gather support from the masses during WW2 , the stalin government re-opened thousands of temples and extinguished the league of militant atheists. Atheist propaganda returned to a lesser extent during the Khruschev government, and continued in a less strict way during the Breszhnev years.

The role of religion in the daily lives of Soviet citizens varied greatly, but two-thirds of the Soviet population were irreligious. About half the people, including members of the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and high-level government officials, professed [[atheism]]. For the majority of Soviet citizens, religion seemed irrelevant. Prior to its collapse in late 1991, official figures on religion in the Soviet Union were not available. State atheism in the Soviet Union was known as ''gosateizm''.&lt;ref name="Kowalewski1980"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/128810 Protest for Religious Rights in the USSR: Characteristics and Consequences], David Kowalewski, ''Russian Review'', Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 426&amp;ndash;441, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Editors and Board of Trustees of the Russian Review&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion in the Socialist People's Republic of Albania ===
{{further2|[[Religion in Albania#Totalitarian regime|Religion in Albania]]&amp;nbsp;|[[Enver Hoxha#Religion|Enver Hoxha]]}}
[[Albania]] was declared an atheist state by [[Enver Hoxha]].&lt;ref&gt;Sang M. Lee writes that Albania was "[o]fficially an atheist state under Hoxha..." [http://www.cbs.dk/centres/cees/network/pdf2000/Lee.pdf Restructuring Albanian Business Education Infrastructure]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} August 2000 (Accessed 6 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Religion in Albania was subordinated in the interest of [[nationalism]] during periods of national revival, when it was identified as foreign predation to Albanian culture. During the late 19th century and also when Albania became a state, religions were suppressed in order to better unify Albanians. This nationalism was also used to justify the communist stance of state atheism between 1967 and 1991.&lt;ref name="Hall1999"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3060414 Representations of Place: Albania], Derek R.

=== Religion in the People's Republic of China ===
{{further|Religion in China}}
The [[People's Republic of China]] was established in 1949 and for much of its early history maintained a hostile attitude toward religion which was seen as emblematic of [[feudalism]] and foreign [[colonialism]]. Houses of worship, including temples, mosques and churches, were converted into non-religious buildings for secular use. However, this attitude relaxed considerably in the late 1970s with the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] guaranteed "freedom of religion" with a number of restrictions.  Since the mid-1990s, there has been a massive program to rebuild Buddhist and Taoist temples that were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, the [[Communist Party of China]] still remains explicitly atheist and religion is heavily regulated, with only specific state-operated churches, mosques and temples being allowed for worship.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DuBois and Chi Zhen "Opiate of the Masses with Chinese Characteristics: Recent Chinese Scholarship on

=== Religion in Cambodia ===
==== Democratic Kampuchea ====
[[Pol Pot]], leader of the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime, suppressed [[Cambodia]]’s Buddhist religion as monks were defrocked; temples and artifacts, including statues of the Buddha, were destroyed; and people praying or expressing other religious sentiments were often killed. The Christian and Muslim communities were among the most persecuted as well. The Roman Catholic cathedral of Phnom Penh was razed. The Khmer Rouge forced Muslims to eat pork, which they regard as an abomination. Many of those who refused were killed. Christian clergy and Muslim imams were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pol Pot - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761579038/pol_pot.html |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwREbWaZ?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761579038/pol_pot.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/cambodia/29.htm Cambodia - Society under the Angkar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== People's Republic of Kampuchea ====
After the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, a [[socialist state]] more reflective of the values shared by [[Vietnam]] and allies of the [[Soviet Union]] was established. Oppression of religious groups was nearly totally ended and relations between religious groups and the People's Republic of Kampuchea were much more neutral throughout its existence until the restoration of the monarchy a decade later.

=== Religion in Laos ===
In contrast with the brutal repression of the [[Buddhism in Cambodia#The Cambodian Sangha|sangha]] undertaken in [[Cambodia]], the Communist government of [[Laos]] has not sought to oppose or suppress Buddhism in Laos to any great degree, rather since the early days of the [[Pathet Lao]] communist officials have sought to use the influence and respect afforded to Buddhist clergy to achieve political goals while discouraging religious practices seen as detrimental to Marxist aims.&lt;ref name="locstudy"&gt;{{cite book |title=Laos: A Country Study|author=Savada, Andrea Matles|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|year=1994|url=http://countrystudies.us/laos/|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting as early as the late 1950s, members of the Pathet Lao sought to encourage support for the communist cause by aligning members of the Lao sangha with the communist opposition.&lt;ref name="locstudy"/&gt; Though resisted by the [[Royal Lao Government]], these efforts were fairly successful and resulted in increased support for the Pathet Lao, particularly in rural communities.&lt;ref name="locstudy"/&gt;

=== Communism and the Baha'i Faith ===
There are many similarities and differences between the schools of thought, but one of the most common things they share are the time frame within which both ideologies were founded as well as some social and economic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;http://bahai-library.com/marxism_intro&lt;/ref&gt; A book by the [[Association for Bahai Studies]] was written as a dialogue between the two schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn = 978-0920904183|title = The Baháʾí Faith and Marxism|last1 = Studies|first1 = Association for Baháʼí|year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis reveals that the [[Bahá'í Faith]] as both a doctrinal manifest and as a present-day emerging organised community is highly cooperative in nature with elements that correspond to various threads of Marxist thought, anarchist thought and more recent liberational thought innovations. Such elements include, for example, no clergy and themes that relate to [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], [[libertarian socialism]] and [[democratic confederalism]].

== Communism and Christianity ==
{{main|Christian communism}}
{{quote|Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the State?

I. a. Feudal Socialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Christian communism]] can be seen as a radical form of [[Christian socialism]]. It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] compel Christians to support [[communism]] as the ideal social system. Although there is no universal agreement on the exact date when Christian communism was founded, many Christian communists assert that evidence from the [[Bible]] suggests that the first Christians, including the [[Apostle (Christian)#twelve apostles|Apostles]], created their own small communist society in the years following Jesus' death and resurrection. As such, many advocates of Christian communism argue that it was taught by Jesus and practiced by the Apostles themselves.

In ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'', [[Friedrich Engels]] draws a certain analogy between the sort of utopian communalism of some of the early Christian communities and the modern-day communist movement, the scientific communist movement representing the proletariat in this era and its world historic transformation of society. Engels noted both certain similarities and certain contrasts.

=== Liberation theology ===
{{main articles|Liberation theology}}
In the 1950s and the 1960s, liberation theology was the political praxis of Latin American theologians, such as [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]] of Peru, [[Leonardo Boff]] of Brazil, [[Juan Luis Segundo]] of Uruguay and [[Jon Sobrino]] of Spain, who made popular the phrase the "[[Option for the poor|Preferential option for the poor]]". Consisting of a synthesis of [[Christian theology]] and Marxist socioeconomic analyses, liberation theology stresses social concern for the poor and advocates for liberation for oppressed peoples. In addition to being a theological matter, liberation theology was often tied to concrete political practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html Liberation Theology] [https://web.archive.org/web/20120311004611/http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html Archived] March 11, 2012, at the [[Wayback Machine]]., Canada &amp; the World, February 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

While liberation theology was most influential in Latin America, it has also been developed in other parts of the world such as [[black theology]] in the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]], [[Palestinian liberation theology]], [[Dalit theology]] in [[India]] and [[Minjung theology]] in [[South Korea]].

== Communism and Islam ==
{{main|Socialism and Islam|Anarchism and Islam}}

The [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]], an exiled political party which opposes the Islamic Republic, once advocated communist ideals, but has since abandoned them.

During the [[Russian Civil War]], [[Jews]] were seen as communist sympathizers and thousands were murdered in pogroms by the [[White Army]]. During the [[Red Scare]] in the United States in the 1950s, a representative of the [[American Jewish Committee]] assured the powerful [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] that "[[Judaism]] and communism are utterly incompatible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Examples include Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], an outspoken [[libertarian communist]], Russian revolutionary and [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialist]] leader [[Isaac Steinberg]] and Rabbi Abraham Bik, an American communist activist.&lt;ref&gt;http://seforim.blogspot.com/2008/03/rabbis-and-communism-by-marc-b.html Rabbis and Communism, a research article by Prof. Marc Shapiro&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communism and Buddhism ==

''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online.&lt;/ref&gt; notably China, Mongolia and Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge.

Many supporters of the [[Viet Cong]] were Buddhists, strongly believing in the unification of Vietnam, with many opposing [[South Vietnam]] due to former President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]'s persecution of Buddhism during the early 1960s.

The current Dalai Lama [[Tenzin Gyatso]] speaks positively of Marxism despite the heavy persecution of the Tibetan people by the post-[[Mao Zedong]] and post-Cultural Revolution Chinese government.

== Religious criticism of communism ==
Because of the perceived atheistic nature of communism, some have accused communism of persecuting religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nocommunism.com/communisms_persecution_of_religion.php Communism Persecutes Religion]. NoCommunism.com. Accessed 15 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, another criticism is that communism is in itself a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2007/12/the_hidden_link.html ''The Hidden Link Between Communism and Religion''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070701032423/http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2007/12/the_hidden_link.html |date=2007-07-01 }}, by Gaither Stewart, [[World Prout Assembly]] 12/08/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/pnlr116&amp;div=33&amp;id=&amp;page= ''Defining Religion in Operational and Institutional Terms''], by A Stephen Boyan, Jr., Accessed 4-1-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Godless communism" ===
{{see also|Communism and atheism}}
Throughout the [[Second Red Scare]], the fear of the "Godless communist" rooted itself as an [[epithet]] and a warning to the United States in a changing global environment. As the perceived threat of the "Godless communist" and materialism to the American way of life grew, "the choice between Americanism and Communism was vital, without room for compromise".&lt;ref&gt;Aiello, Thomas.

'''Møn''' is an island in south-eastern Denmark. Until 1 January 2007, it was a municipality in its own right but it is now part of the municipality of [[Vordingborg Municipality|Vordingborg]], after merging with the former municipalities of [[Langebæk]], [[Præstø]], and Vordingborg. This has created a municipality with an area of {{convert|615|km²|0|abbr=on}} and a total population of 46,307 (2005).  It belongs to the [[Region Sjælland]] ("Zealand Region"). Møn is one of Denmark's most popular destinations for tourists with its [[Møns Klint|white chalk cliffs]], countryside, sandy beaches and the market town of [[Stege, Denmark|Stege]]. In June 2017, [[UNESCO]] designated Møn as Denmark's first biosphere reserve, consisting of "a series of islands and islets in the southern Baltic Sea, over approximately 45,118 hectares (131,890 acres). Its landscapes include woodlands, grasslands, meadows, wetlands, coastal areas, ponds and steep hills."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/denmark/moen/|title=Moen Biosphere Reserve (Denmark)|publisher=Unesco|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Møn is located just off the south-eastern tip of [[Zealand]] from which it is separated by the waters of the ''Hølen'' strait between Kalvehave and the island of [[Nyord]], at the northern end of Møn.  Further south is [[Stege Bay]]. At the narrowest point between the two islands, the waters are referred to as Wolf Strait (''Ulvsund''), which is the primary strait separating Møn from Zealand.

To the southwest is [[Stubbekøbing]] on the island of [[Falster]], which is separated from Møn by the [[Grønsund]] (Green Strait).

[[File:Kalvehave harbour.JPG|right|thumb|Kalvehave harbour with the Queen Alexandrine Bridge to the island of Møn in the background]]
There are a number of islands in the waters off Møn, including Nyord and [[Bogø]], the smaller island of [[Farø]], as well as the islands of [[Langø]], [[Tærø]] and Lilleø off the coast of Zealand.  The island of [[Lindholm, Stege Bugt|Lindholm]] in Stege Bugt is state-owned, and is the location for the State Veterinary Institute for Virus Research (''Statens Veterinære Institut for Virusforskning'').

==Transport links==
[[File:farobridge.jpg|left|thumb|Farø south bridge to Falster]]
Møn is connected to Zealand at the town of Kalvehave by the [[Queen Alexandrine Bridge]]. The bridge opened for traffic on 30 May 1943, and is named after [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Queen Alexandrine]], the [[Queen Consort]] of King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]]. The bridge is {{convert|746|m|ft|0}} long and considered to be one of Denmark's most attractive bridges.

At the south-western corner, Møn disconnects by causeway to the {{convert|5|x|7|km|0|abbr=on}} island of Bogø. From Bogø another causeway connects to the small island of Farø, which acts as the centre point for the [[Farø Bridges]] carrying the motorway between Zealand and Falster. The north Farø bridge has a span of {{convert|1.5|km|0|abbr=on}}, the south bridge a span of {{convert|1.7|km|0|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|290|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} central span for shipping. The central span is supported by cables from two {{convert|95|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} pylons which raise the bridge {{convert|26|m|ft|0}} [[above sea level]]. The bridge was completed in 1984 and forms part of Euroroute [[European route E47|E47]] from Copenhagen (and [[Helsingborg]]) to [[Lübeck]] (and thence [[Hamburg]] and the south).

At the north-western tip of Møn there is a narrow bridge to the small island of Nyord.

==The town of Stege==
{{Main|Stege, Denmark}}
Stege, the largest town on the island of Møn, is situated approximately at the centre point of the island at the mouth of Stege Nor, a lake which connects directly to the sea. The population is around 4,000. The town has a great deal of charm with historic buildings, a marina and several restaurants and cafes. [[Stege Church]] built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style dates from the early 13th century. The annual "Stege Festival" takes place every Tuesday in July, and the first Tuesday in August.

==Attractions==
Møn is known for its natural beauty, sandy beaches, [[fresco]]-decorated churches, [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[passage grave]]s and [[dolmen|monuments]], and [[Møns Klint]] ("The White Cliffs of Møn"), the island's most popular attraction.
[[File:Møns Klint Cliffs.JPG|right|upright|thumb|The beach and steps descending from the 100 m cliffs of Møns Klint]]
The cliffs, c. 6&amp;nbsp;km long and up to 128 metres tall, are Denmark's highest, and support a unique set of natural habitats. Access to the narrow beach is via a flight of 500 steps from the parking area set within the beech forest behind the cliffs. The [[GeoCenter Møns Klint]], a geological museum tracing the origins of Denmark and the formation of the cliffs opened there in May 2007. The combination of [[chalk]] in the [[soil|subsoil]] with a dry local climate, and its agricultural use consisting primarily of cattle grazing, has created some of Denmark's richest meadowlands.  The chalk was transported to Møn during the fourth, and [[Last glacial period|most recent, major ice age]].

[[File:Liselundlake.jpg|left|thumb|Manor house at Liselund]]
Another attraction close to the cliffs is [[Liselund]], the romantic summer residence erected in the 1790s by French nobleman [[Antoine de Bosc de la Calmette]] for his wife, Lise. The miniature thatched palace and grounds were designed by [[Andreas Kirkerup]], one of the foremost landscape architects of the times.  A larger house was constructed in the park in 1887 by Baron Fritz Rosenkrantz, which is now a hotel. The park is open to the public and includes the original thatched manor house, Swiss cottage, Chinese tea house and Norwegian log cabin. Calmette was also responsible for the park at Marienborg, to the west of Stege.

At the north-western corner of Møn is a narrow bridge to the island of [[Nyord]]. The small village on the island has a number of quaint cottages and farmhouses as well as a unique octagonal church and a small harbour. Nyord is an important habitat for geese, ducks and other wading birds. There is a bird-watching tower for the use of visitors.
[[File:Nyordchurch.jpg|right|thumb|Nyord Church]]

At the south-western corner, Møn connects by causeway to the 5 by 7&amp;nbsp;km island of Bogø. The island has a preserved windmill, an old bording school and a summer ferry to [[Stubbekøbing]].

[[File:Elmelundekirke.jpg|left|thumb|Elmelunde church]]
Møn has a number of interesting churches decorated with [[Church frescos in Denmark|frescos]]. [[Fanefjord Church]] dates back to the 13th century, and has a set of recently restored frescos painted in 1450 by the [[Elmelunde Master]]. Frescos can also be seen in Elmelunde Church, the oldest church on the island, with parts dating from the start of the 12th century. [[Keldby Church]] has a unique altarpiece and is also richly decorated with frescos. Another interesting church is the one at [[Damsholte Church|Damsholte]]. It is one of the finest [[Rococo]] buildings in Denmark and the only village church built in the Rococo style.

The oldest and perhaps most impressive burial mound on Møn is [[Grønsalen]] near [[Fanefjord Church]]. The 100 m by 10 m barrow is from around 3500 BC. According to legend, it is the resting place of Chief [[Grønjæger]] (Greenranger) and his wife Queen Fane, after whom Grønsund and Fanefjord were named. There are also barrows at Raaby and Busemarke. There is also a 5,000-year-old round burial barrow at Sømarke, and others at Jættestue and Jordehøj. Kong Asgers Høj at Sprove is the largest gallery grave in Denmark, more than 4,000 years old. It has been fully excavated and can be visited inside.  There is another round barrow at nearby Rundysse, and a further recently restored 9 metre long double passage gallery grave at [[Klekkende Høj]] from the Neolithic age c. 4,500 years old.

[[Thorsvang, Danmarks Samlermuseum]] is a museum of [[collectables]] arranged in a number of old shops typical of the early 20th century. It is located in the Lendemarke district of Stege.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;[http://www.tv2east.dk/artikler/danmarks-samlermuseum-aabnede-paa-moen Phillippa Maigaard, "Danmarks Samlermuseum åbnede på Møn"], ''tv2 øst''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 19 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a jewellery museum in the little village of Damme and near Keldbylille, there is a museum (Museumsgaarden) depicting life on a Møn farm as it was 100 years ago. There are also several art galleries and arts and crafts centres on the island.

Møn also has a number of popular beach resorts, particularly in East Møn with [[Ulvshale]] to the north and [[Råbylille Strand]], [[Klintholm Havn]] and [[Hårbølle]] on the south side of the island.

==History==
{{See also|History of Denmark}}

===Early settlements===
{{see also|Sømarkedyssen}}

There is evidence that people lived in Denmark more than 100,000 years ago, but the area became covered with ice during the last ice age. People returned to Møn about 10,000 years ago during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era. At that time the island was part of mainland Europe.

During the [[Mesolithic]] era (6800-3900 BC) there is evidence from findings of small [[Flint (tool)|flint]] and bone tools that inhabitants of the island lived by hunting and fishing.  The landscape was largely wooded, with hazel and increasingly oak and alder trees. From around 5400 BC reforestation was complete, forming an inaccessible forest and forcing out the last of the big animals such as [[aurochs]] and [[elk]]. Human habitations have been found along the eastern coast.

The [[Neolithic]] era, (3900-1700 BC) saw the start of cattle farming spreading inland from the coastal settlements. Flint axes were used, and trading occurred in flint, gold, copper and bronze. This era saw the start of [[Long barrow|barrow]] building for the dead, and settlements have been found at Rødkilde. Barrows became larger, longer and contained multiple burials. More than 100 large graves have been found on Møn. The period from 2400&amp;ndash;1700 is known as Doltktiden, after the flint daggers which became common at that time. Bronze was also in use, imported from the south.

Around 2000 BC, a new wave of people arrived on Møn, the Stridsøksekulturen (the battleaxe people). They brought with them goats, sheep and horses, and their trademark stone battleaxes. They used simpler graves with small round mounds.

Bronze became more common, hence the period 1700-500 BC became the [[Nordic Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] and flint ceased to be used for tools. [[Tumulus|Large round mounds]] were used for burial, and more than 200 of these have been found on Møn. Each mound covered a single grave, containing a coffin made from a single split and hollowed oak tree. From 1000-500 BC, graves became smaller and cremation began to be practiced. Graves were encircled by a ring of stones. Fewer items were buried with the dead, as a result of changes in society which made grave robbing more likely.

From 500 BC, iron began to be used in the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]]. The climate became cooler and wetter, causing difficulties for agriculture. Few remains have been found from the period 500-0 BC, but Celtic culture became an influence.

The Roman Empire stopped short of Denmark, but from 0-400 AD in the [[Roman Iron Age]] there is evidence of imported Roman goods in silver, bronze and gold. Little has been found from the post-Roman [[Germanic Iron Age]] until about 800 AD. Two treasure hoards have been found on Møn from the [[Viking Age]] 800-1050.

===Unification of Denmark===
[[File:Mønbo Herred.png|right|thumb|Historical ''Herred'' administrative districts of Møn equivalent to English ''Hundreds'']]
The last recorded independent ruler of the island of Møn was Hemming, son of Sigvard Snogøje (Sigvard Snake-eye) in the early 10th century, who carried out raids on other territories. Møn itself was subject to raids, particularly [[Wends]] from [[Rügen]] and [[Fehmarn]].

From 900-1000 AD forests were steadily cleared and there was a profitable trade in grain with the Baltic countries. The relative wealth and large population of the island is indicated by the large number of churches built at that time. However, this wealth increased the likelihood of Vendian raids. This in turn led to the deliberate retention of some coastal forest areas as protection against raiders.

The construction of the castle of Stegeborg was around 1220 in timber, then rebuilt in brick by 1245, despite this being a relatively peaceful period.  On the death of King [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] in 1241, a dispute arose over the succession, which led to the island being raided by Lubeckers who took the part of one of the claimants, Knud Duke of Blekinge who was imprisoned by his brother [[Eric IV of Denmark|Erik Plovpenning]] (king 1241-1250) in Stegeborg. The Lubeckers conquered Copenhagen, then Stege to release the Duke. These raids continued intermittently into the 16th century. The succession wars also led to further raids in 1260 when the island was seized by Prince Järmer of Rügen. The Germans gained rights to establish a trading outpost at Brøndhøj. A Norwegian, Alf Ellingsen, was also attracted by the island, defeating a defending fleet of 30 vessels to raid Møn and other islands during the reign of [[Eric V of Denmark|Erik Glipping]] (1259–1286). Glipping granted Stege a town charter, granting it sole rights to trade and tax certain commodities, which existed until 1857.

From the middle of the 12th to the mid-17th century, Møn became a Danish crown property and was managed by a feudal lord. Its relative importance meant that appointments were made from the ranks of highest Danish nobility. The lord had responsibility for maintaining order and collecting taxes, hosting visits from royalty and important guests, and judging legal disputes. As a royal possession, the island was used as surety against loans made to the crown, and passed into various hands while debts remained unpaid. This gave the pledge holders the right to extract whatever revenue they could from the island while it remained pledged as security. Prince Witslav of Rügen held the island for 20 years from 1286, resulting in rebellions against him and further Norwegian raids.

===Herring fisheries, prosperity and decline===
The island, and Stege in particular, prospered in the 14th century from the results of herring fishing, reaching the height of its wealth around 1500. It adopted a coat of arms including three herrings, and the town defences were strengthened. Around 1430 a rampart, wall and moat were created around the town by [[Erik of Pomerania|Eric VII]]. Three towers were created at each of the main approach roads, of which only Møllerporten still survives. However, the fortifications were no defence against fire, which at one point destroyed the greater part of the town, or against the plague.

In 1447, [[Christopher of Bayern|King Christopher III]] granted the town rights to trade outside Møn, within the remainder of Denmark. In 1450, [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] forbade farmers to trade goods outside of Denmark, with the result that they sailed directly to Germany to sell their goods, bypassing the town of Stege, which was starved of goods and revenue. In 1476, the town received confirmation of its historic rights and, in 1481, a further law forbade foreigners trading with farmers on Møn. This was reaffirmed by [[John of Denmark|King Hans]] in 1507.

In 1510, the Lubeckers attacked Møn in retaliation for the trade sanctions, failing to take Stege but destroying the island's second largest town, [[Borre, Denmark|Borre]]. The trade war continued, and in 1524 [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] again felt the need to repeat the ban on trade on Møn anywhere except in the town of Stege. In 1533, Frederick died leading again to a dispute over the crown. The townspeople sided with the previously deposed [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]], but the castle was in the hands of [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. As a result, the castle was taken by deceit by townspeople and blown up. The four leaders were hanged, but the castle was not rebuilt. In 1538, Christian III once again repeated the trade ban, as the citizens of Stege still could not obtain sufficient food for the town.

At the start of the 16th century, around 2000 people lived in Stege. However, the herring fisheries were in decline and the town was taxed heavily to pay for continuing wars. Farmers began to sell goods to the harbour at Grønsund, and the island was again pledged against a debt. By 1582 [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway|Frederick II]] was obliged to cut taxes on the town and waive unpaid back taxes, as the town was effectively bankrupt. In 1583, trade with Germany was again banned. [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] granted land outside Stege to the town so that the inhabitants might grow food for themselves. In 1627, more land was granted.

The death of Christian IV in 1648 meant the end of the 30-year war, but his successor [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] commenced war against Sweden. Copenhagen was occupied and Swedes sought to invade Møn by walking across the ice from Zealand. This was prevented by the islanders, who maintained a three-mile long opening in the ice to stop the invasion force. However, in May 1659, 3,000 Swedes invaded from the island of Bogø against a force of 500 defenders. Stege was occupied, the town hall and 300 farms destroyed, the island looted and the harvest lost. At the end of the war, in 1660, the island's population was reduced to 670.

Frederick III introduced direct rule, replacing feudal regions with counties and attempted to restore the economy. However, in 1664 Møn was again pledged against loans, this time to a Dutchman Gabriel Marselis. In 1684, the pledge was redeemed, at which time Stege was half in ruins, almost all the forests had been cut down and many farms had been abandoned. In 1685, four battalions of cavalry were sent to the island and stationed at Marienborg. To build barracks at Marienborg, their commander Colonel Von Plessen demolished damaged buildings in Stege to re-use their stone, including the town wall and two of the gate towers. The third was converted into a prison. In 1696, the further depredation of the island was discovered by the authorities, and Plessen was himself imprisoned. All taxes on the island were cancelled for two years.

===Restored fortunes===
In 1703, an attempt was made to found a navigation school in Stege. This failed, but generally the Danish economy was beginning to recover from the long period of wars. In 1769, Crown property on Møn was sold which allowed farmers to buy their own land and wealthy individuals to create estates and begin to settle on the island. In 1774, a major fire destroyed 112 properties in the northern part of Stege, but by 1782 there were four distilleries in the town, and by 1807, 18.

In 1733, [[Christian VI of Denmark|Christian VI]] introduced a law compelling peasants to remain on the estate where they were born until the age of 36. This was to provide a fixed work force, but also aid military conscription. The law was abolished in 1788 by the then regent, later to become [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick VI]].

By 1789, the population of Stege had climbed to 791 with 7,000 people on the island. In 1797, [[Antoine de Bosc de la Calmette|Antoine de Calmette]] was placed in charge of the county, and was, for once, a respected leader.

In 1857, the town trade monopoly was finally abolished.

At the start of the 20th century about 14,000 people lived on the island.  This figure then fell, but stabilised in the 1970s.

==Economy==
Tourism plays an important role in the local economy. One of the largest employers is Bisca, a manufacturer of cakes and biscuits headquartered in Stege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vordingborg.dk/cms/site.aspx?p=11293&amp;NewsID=3324|title=Bisca styrker den locale konkurrenceevne|publisher=Vordingborg Kommune|accessdate=30 December 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Møns Bank traces its history back to 1877. About one third of its customers live on the island. The old town hall in Stege was converted into a centre for entrepreneurship in 2008 and is now home to some 10 start-ups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydtid.dk/slotsfruen-og-igangs%C3%A6tteren-p%C3%A5-m%C3%B8n|title=Slotsfruen og igangsætteren på Møn|publisher=Sydsjællands Tidende|accessdate=30 December 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Møn hosted the 30th world vintage bicycle rally for the [[International Veteran Cycle Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cykelfestival.dk/index.php/1284048 *The 30th IVCA Rally – 2010 in Denmark".] Retrieved 3 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 150 enthusiasts from 17 countries visited the island with their historic pedal bicycles from 2 to 6 June. One of the challenges for the participants was to clock up {{convert|100|mi|km}} between sunrise and sunset on [[velocipede]]s built between 1818 and 1960. Apart from countries across Europe, some participants came from as far as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ugebladetsydsjaelland.dk/VM-paa-Hobby-Horse-og-Vaeltepeter/Ugebladet-Sydsjaelland/artikel/61994 "VM på Hobby Horse og Væltepeter"], ''Ugebladed Sydsjæland''. {{Da icon}} Retrieved 4 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optimism''' is a mental [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] reflecting a belief or hope that the outcome of some specific endeavor, or outcomes in general, will be positive, favorable, and desirable. A common [[idiom]] used to illustrate optimism versus pessimism is [[Is the glass half empty or half full?|a glass filled with water to the halfway point]]: an optimist is said to see the glass as half full, while a pessimist sees the glass as half empty.

The term derives from the Latin ''optimum'', meaning "best". Being optimistic, in the typical sense of the word, is defined as expecting the best possible outcome from any given situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/optimism|title=Definition of optimism|access-date=November 14, 2017|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115083225/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/optimism|archivedate=November 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually referred to in [[psychology]] as dispositional optimism. It thus reflects a belief that future conditions will work out for the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/optimism|title=optimism - Definition of optimism in English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234436/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/optimism|archivedate=2014-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of optimism include dispositional models, and models of [[explanatory style]]. Methods to measure optimism have been developed within both theoretical systems, such as various forms of the Life Orientation Test, for the original definition of optimism, or the Attributional Style Questionnaire designed to test optimism in terms of explanatory style.

Variation in optimism and pessimism is somewhat [[heritability|heritable]]&lt;ref name="Bates2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=Timothy C. |title=The glass is half full and half empty: A population-representative twin study testing if optimism and pessimism are distinct systems |journal=[[The Journal of Positive Psychology]] |date=25 February 2015 |doi=10.1080/17439760.2015.1015155 |volume=10 |pages=533–542}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reflects [[biological trait]] systems to some degree.&lt;ref name="Sharot2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sharot |first1=Tali |title=The optimism bias |journal=Current Biology |date=December 2011 |volume=21 |issue=23 |pages=R941–R945 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.030 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211011912}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also influenced by [[environmental factors]], including family environment,&lt;ref name="Bates2015"/&gt; with some suggesting it can be learned.&lt;ref name="Vaughan 2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=Susan C. |last=Vaughan |title=Half Empty, Half Full: Understanding the Psychological Roots of Optimism |location=New York |publisher=Courtyard |year=2000 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism may also be linked to [[health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|U9cGdRNMdQQ|Ron Gutman: The hidden power of smiling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispositional optimism ===
[[File:Оптимист и пессимист.jpg|thumb|220px|''An optimist and a pessimist'', [[Vladimir Makovsky]], 1893]]
Researchers [[operationalize]] the term differently depending on their research. As with any trait characteristic, there are several ways to evaluate optimism, such as the Life Orientation Test (LOT).

Dispositional optimism and pessimism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=Dispositional optimism and physical well-being: the influence of generalized outcome expectancies on health |last1=Scheier |first1=M. F. |last2=Carver |first2=C.

The LOT returns separate optimism and pessimism scores for each individual. Behaviourally, these two scores correlate around r = 0.5. Optimistic scores on this scale predict better outcomes in relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social relationships and health |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.3399889 |journal=Science |date=1988-07-29 |pages=540–545 |volume=241 |issue=4865 |doi=10.1126/science.3399889 |first=J. |last=House |first2=K. |last2=Landis |first3=D |last3=Umberson}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher [[social status]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Depression and socio-economic risk factors: 7-year longitudinal population study |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/190/4/293 |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |date=2007-04-01 |issn=0007-1250 |pmid=17401034 |pages=293–298 |volume=190 |issue=4 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.105.020040 |first=Vincent |last=Lorant |first2=Christophe |last2=Croux |first3=Scott |last3=Weich |first4=Denise |last4=Deliège |first5=Johan |last5=Mackenbach |first6=Marc |last6=Ansseau |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151222003929/http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/190/4/293 |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reduced loss of well-being following adversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the self-regulation of behavior |last1=Carver |first1=C.

Some have argued that pessimism and optimism are ends of a single dimension, with any distinction between them reflecting factors such as [[Social desirability bias|social desirability]].  [[Confirmatory factor analysis|Confirmatory modelling]], however, supports a two-dimensional model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Separating optimism and pessimism: A robust psychometric analysis of the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). |url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.4.433 |journal=Psychological Assessment |pages=433–438 |volume=18 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.4.433 |first=Philipp Yorck |last=Herzberg |first2=Heide |last2=Glaesmer |first3=Jürgen |last3=Hoyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two dimensions predict different outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Distinguishing optimism from pessimism in older adults: Is it more important to be optimistic or not to be pessimistic? |url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1345 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |pages=1345–1353 |volume=73 |issue=6 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1345 |first=Susan |last=Robinson-Whelen |first2=Cheongtag |last2=Kim |first3=Robert C. |last3=MacCallum |first4=Janice K. |last4=Kiecolt-Glaser}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic modelling confirms this independence, showing that pessimism and optimism are inherited as independent traits, with the typical correlation between them emerging as a result of a general well-being factor and family environment influences.&lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt;

=== Explanatory style ===

[[Explanatory style]] is distinct from dispositional theories of optimism. While related to life-orientation measures of optimism, attributional style theory suggests that dispositional optimism and [[pessimism]] are reflections of the ways people explain events, i.e., that attributions cause these dispositions {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Measures of attributional style distinguish three dimensions among explanations for events: Whether these explanations draw on internal versus external causes; whether the causes are viewed as stable versus unstable; and whether explanations apply globally versus being situationally specific. In addition, the measures distinguish attributions for positive and for negative events.

An optimistic person attributes internal, stable, and global explanations to good things. Pessimistic explanations attribute these traits of stability, globality, and internality to negative events, such as difficulty in relationships.&lt;ref name="Gillham2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillham |first1=Jane E. |last2=Shatté |first2=Andrew J. |last3=Reivich |first3=Karen J. |last4=Seligman |first4=Martin E. P. |editor1-last=Chang |editor1-first=Edward C. |title=Optimism and Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice |date=2001 |publisher=American Psychological Association |location=Washington, DC |pages=53–75 |isbn=978-1-55798-691-7 |chapter=Optimism, Pessimism, and Explanatory Style}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models of Optimistic and Pessimistic attributions show that attributions themselves are a cognitive style – individuals who tend to focus on the global explanations do so for all types of events, and the styles correlate among each other. In addition to this, individuals vary in how optimistic their attributions are for good events, and on how pessimistic their attributions are for bad events, but these two traits of optimism and pessimism are un-correlated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The structure of attributional style: Cognitive styles and optimism–pessimism bias in the Attributional Style Questionnaire|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914001810|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2014-08-01|pages = 79–85|volume = 66|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2014.03.022|first = Caimei|last = Liu|first2 = Timothy C.|last2 = Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is much debate about the relationship between explanatory style and optimism. Some researchers argue that optimism is simply the lay-term for what researchers know as explanatory style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. |last=Peterson |title=The Future of Optimism |journal=American Psychologist |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=44–55 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, it is found that explanatory style is quite distinct from dispositional optimism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Abramson |first2=B. |last2=Dykman |first3=D. |last3=Needles |title=Attributional Style and Theory: Let No One Tear Them Asunder |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=11–13 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0201_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Zullow |title=Explanations and Expectations: Understanding the 'Doing' Side of Optimism |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=45–49 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0201_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two should not be used interchangeably as they are marginally correlated at best. More research is required to "bridge" or further differentiate these concepts.&lt;ref name="Gillham2001" /&gt;

=== Origins ===
[[File:Optimistic Personality.png|thumb|Optimistic Personality (modified from &lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt;)]]

As with all psychological traits, differences in both dispositional optimism and pessimism &lt;ref name="Bates2015"/&gt;  and in attributional style  &lt;ref name="Schulman 1993 569–574"&gt;{{cite journal |first = P.|last = Schulman|first2 = D.|last2 = Keith|first3 = M.|last3 = Seligman|title = Is Optimism Heritable?

Both optimism and pessimism are strongly influenced by [[environmental factors]], including family environment.&lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt; It has been suggested that optimism may be indirectly inherited as a reflection of underlying heritable traits such as [[intelligence]], [[temperament]] and [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="Schulman 1993 569–574"/&gt; Many theories assume optimism can be [[Learned helplessness|learned]],&lt;ref name="Vaughan 2000" /&gt; and research supports a modest role of family-environment acting to raise (or lower) optimism and lower (or raise) [[neuroticism]] and pessimism.&lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt;

Work utilising [[brain imaging]] and [[biochemistry]] suggests that at a [[biological trait]] level, optimism and pessimism reflect brain systems specialised for the tasks of processing and incorporating beliefs regarding [[Optimism bias|good and bad information]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Sharot2011"/&gt;

=== Assessment ===

==== Life Orientation Test ====

The Life Orientation Test (LOT) was designed by Scheier and Carver (1985) to assess dispositional optimism – expecting positive or negative outcomes,&lt;ref name="Gillham2001"/&gt; and is one of the more popular tests of optimism and pessimism. There are eight items and four filler items. Four are positive items (e.g. "''In uncertain times, I usually expect the best''") and four are negative items e.g. "''If something can go wrong for me, it will.''"&lt;ref name="ScheierCarver1985"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Scheier|first1 = Michael F.|last2 = Carver|first2 = Charles S.|title = Optimism, coping, and health: Assessment and implications of generalized outcome expectancies.|journal = Health Psychology|date = 1985|volume = 4|issue = 3|pages = 219–247|doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.4.3.219|pmid = 4029106|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/hea/4/3/219/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LOT has been revised twice—once by the original creators (LOT-R) and also by Chang, Maydeu-Olivares, and D'Zurilla as the Extended Life Orientation Test (ELOT). The Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R: Scheier, Carver, &amp; Bridges, 1994) consists of 6 items, each scored on a 5-point scale from "Strongly disagree" to "Strongly agree".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Distinguishing optimism from neuroticism (and trait anxiety, self-mastery, and self-esteem): A reevaluation of the Life Orientation Test.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1063|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 1063–1078|volume = 67|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1063|first = Michael F.|last = Scheier|first2 = Charles S.|last2 = Carver|first3 = Michael W.|last3 = Bridges|pmid=7815302|date=December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attributional Style Questionnaire ====

This Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ: Peterson et al. 1982 &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=Christopher |last2=Semmel |first2=Amy |last3=von Baeyer |first3=Carl |last4=Abramson |first4=Lyn Y. |last5=Metalsky |first5=Gerald I. |last6=Seligman |first6=Martin E.

Subjects read a list of six positive and negative events (e.g. "''you have been looking for a job unsuccessfully for some time''"), and are asked to record a possible cause for the event. They then rate whether this is internal or external, stable or changeable, and global or local to the event.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; There are several modified versions of the ASQ including the Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire (EASQ), the Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations (CAVE), and the ASQ designed for testing the optimism of children.&lt;ref name="Gillham2001" /&gt;

=== Associations with health ===

Optimism and [[health]] are correlated moderately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=Christopher |last2=Park |first2=Nansook |last3=Kim |first3=Eric S. |title=Can optimism decrease the risk of illness and disease among the elderly? |journal=Aging Health |date=February 2012 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |doi=10.2217/ahe.11.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism has been shown to [[explained variation|explain]] between 5–10% of the variation in the likelihood of developing some health conditions ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]]s between .20 and .30),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peterson |first1=Christopher |last2=Bossio |first2=Lisa M. |editor1-last=Chang |editor1-first=Edward C. |title=Optimism and Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice |date=2001 |publisher=American Psychological Association |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-1-55798-691-7 |pages=127–145 |chapter=Optimism and Physical Well-Being}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably including [[cardiovascular disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheier |first1=Michael F. |last2=Matthews |first2=Karen A. |last3=Owens |first3=Jane F. |last4=Magovern |first4=George J. |last5=Lefebvre |first5=R.

The relationship between optimism and health has also been studied with regards to physical symptoms, coping strategies and negative affect for those suffering from [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[asthma]], and [[fibromyalgia]].

It has been found that among individuals with these diseases, optimists are not more likely than pessimists to report pain alleviation due to coping strategies, despite differences in psychological well-being between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Glenn |last1=Affleck |first2=Howard |last2=Tennen |first3=Andrea |last3=Apter |chapter=Optimism, Pessimism, and Daily Life With Chronic Illness |title=Optimism &amp; Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice |editor-first=E. |editor-last=Chang |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=2001 |pages=147–168 |isbn=9781557986917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] has confirmed the assumption that optimism is related to psychological well-being: "Put simply, optimists emerge from difficult circumstances with less distress than do pessimists."&lt;ref name="Scheier"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael F. |last=Scheier |first2=Charles S. |last2=Carver |first3=Michael W. |last3=Bridges |chapter=Optimism, Pessimism, and Psychological Well-Being |title=Optimism &amp; Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice |editor-first=E. |editor-last=Chang |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=2001 |pages=189–216 |isbn=1-55798-691-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the correlation appears to be attributable to coping style: "That is, optimists seem intent on facing problems head-on, taking active and constructive steps to solve their problems; pessimists are more likely to abandon their effort to attain their goals."&lt;ref name="Scheier" /&gt;

Optimists may respond better to stress: pessimists have shown higher levels of cortisol (the "stress hormone") and trouble regulating cortisol in response to stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Bergland, Christopher. "Optimism Stabilizes Cortisol Levels and Lowers Stress."Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness + Find a Therapist. N.p., n.d. Web. . http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201307/optimism-stabilizes-cortisol-levels-and-lowers-stress.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by Scheier examined the recovery process for a number of patients that had undergone surgery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The study showed that optimism was a strong predictor of the rate of recovery. Optimists achieved faster results in "behavioral milestones" such as sitting in bed, walking around, etc. They also were rated by staff as having a more favorable physical recovery. In a 6-month later follow-up, it was found that optimists were quicker to resume normal activities.

=== Optimism and well-being ===
A number of studies have been done on optimism and psychological well-being. One study conducted by Aspinwall and Taylor (1990) assessed incoming freshmen on a range of personality factors such as optimism, self-esteem, locus of self-control, etc.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheier |first1=Michael F. |last2=Carver |first2=Charles S. |title=Effects of optimism on psychological and physical well-being: Theoretical overview and empirical update |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |date=April 1992 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=201–228 |doi=10.1007/BF01173489}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that freshmen who scored high on optimism before entering college were reported to have lower levels of psychological distress than their more pessimistic peers, while controlling for the other personality factors. Over time, the more optimistic students were less stressed, less lonely, and less depressed than their pessimistic counterparts. Thus, this study suggests a strong link between optimism and psychological well-being.

In addition low optimism may help explain the association between caregivers' anger and reduced sense of vitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=López|first=J.|last2=Romero-Moreno|first2=R.|last3=Márquez-González|first3=M.|last4=Losada|first4=A.|date=2015-04-01|title=Anger and Health in Dementia Caregivers: Exploring the Mediation Effect of Optimism|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.2539/abstract|journal=Stress and Health|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=158–165|doi=10.1002/smi.2539|issn=1532-2998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent meta-analysis of optimism supported past findings that optimism is positively correlated with [[life satisfaction]], happiness, psychological and physical well-being and negatively correlated with depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alarcon |first1=Gene M. |last2=Bowling |first2=Nathan A. |last3=Khazon |first3=Steven |title=Great expectations: A meta-analytic examination of optimism and hope |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=May 2013 |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=821–827 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to explain the correlation, researchers find that optimists choose healthier lifestyles. For example, optimists smoke less, are more physically active, consume more fruit, vegetables and whole-grain bread, and are more moderate in alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giltay|first1=Erik J.|last2=Geleijnse|first2=Johanna M.|last3=Zitman|first3=Frans G.|last4=Buijsse|first4=Brian|last5=Kromhout|first5=Daan|title=Lifestyle and dietary correlates of dispositional optimism in men: The Zutphen Elderly Study|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=November 2007|volume=63|issue=5|pages=483–490|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.07.014|pmid=17980220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Translating association into modifiability ===

Research to date has demonstrated that optimists are less likely to have certain diseases or develop certain diseases over time. By comparison, research has not yet been able to demonstrate the ability to change an individual's level of optimism through [[psychological intervention]]s, and thereby alter the course of disease or likelihood for development of disease.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Though in that same vein, an article by [[Mayo Clinic]] argues steps to change [[self-talk]] from negative to positive may shift individuals from a negative to a more positive/optimistic outlook.&lt;ref name="MayoTalk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/positive-thinking/art-20043950 | title=Positive thinking: Stop negative self-talk to reduce stress | publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] | date=March 4, 2014 | accessdate=September 18, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916091418/http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/positive-thinking/art-20043950 | archivedate=September 16, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies claimed to be of value include surrounding oneself with positive people, identifying areas of change, practicing positive self-talk, being open to humor, and following a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref name="MayoTalk"/&gt;

==Philosophical optimism==
&lt;!-- "Philosophical optimism" redirects here --&gt;
Distinct from a disposition to believe that things will work out, there is a philosophical idea that, perhaps in ways that may not be fully comprehended, the present moment is in an optimum state.  This view that all of nature - past, present, and future - operates by laws of optimization along the lines of [[Hamilton's principle]] in the realm of physics is countered by views such as [[idealism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], and philosophical [[pessimism]]. [[Philosophy|Philosopher]]s often link the concept of optimism with the name of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who held that we live in the [[best of all possible worlds]] (''le meilleur des mondes possibles''), or that God created a physical universe that applies the laws of physics. 

Leibniz proposed that it was not in God's power to create a perfect world, but among possible worlds, he created the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire|last=Cronk|first=Nicholas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780521849739|location=Cambridge|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his writings, he responded to the [[Blaise Pascal]]'s philosophy of awe and desperation in the face of the infinite by claiming that infinity should be celebrated. While Pascal advocated for making man's rational aspirations more humble, Leibniz was optimistic about the capacity of human reason to further extend itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Studies in Early Modern Philosophy, Volume 8|last=Garber|first=Daniel|last2=Rutherford|first2=Donald|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780198829294|location=9780198829294|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was famously mocked by [[Voltaire]] in his satirical novel ''[[Candide]]'' as baseless optimism of the sort exemplified by the beliefs of one of its characters [[Candide#Main characters|Dr. Pangloss]], which are the opposite of his fellow traveller [[Martin (Candide)|Martin]]'s [[pessimism]] and emphasis on [[free will]]. 
The optimistic position is also called [[:wikt:Panglossianism|Panglossianism]] and became an adjective for excessive, even stupendous, optimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Regret: On Collective Memory and Historical Responsibility|last=Olick|first=Jeffrey|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415956833|location=New York|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "panglossian pessimism" has been used{{by whom|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}} to describe the pessimistic position that, since this is the best of all possible worlds, it is impossible for anything to get any better. Conversely,   philosophical pessimism might be{{by whom|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}} associated with an optimistic long-term view because it implies that no change for the worse is possible. 
&lt;!--[[William Godwin]] for instance argued that society would eventually reach the state where calm reason would replace all violence and force, that mind could eventually make matter subservient to it, and that intelligence could discover the secret of [[immortality]].{{year needed}}{{page needed}} -- does Godwin make any explicit reference to pessimism?--&gt;

===Optimalism===
&lt;!-- Redirect from optimalism to here --&gt;
Philosophical optimalism, as defined by [[Nicholas Rescher]], holds that this universe exists because it is better than the alternatives.&lt;ref name=Rescher2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Optimalism and axiological metaphysics|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=807–35|issn=0034-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this philosophy does not exclude the possibility of a [[deity]], it also doesn't require one, and is compatible with [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinhart|first=Eric|title=Platonic Atheism|url=http://www.ericsteinhart.com/articles/platonicatheism.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710200257/http://www.ericsteinhart.com/articles/platonicatheism.pdf|archivedate=10 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological optimalism, as defined by the [[positive psychology|positive psychologist]] [[Tal Ben-Shahar]], means willingness to accept failure while remaining confident that success will follow, a positive attitude he contrasts with negative [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]].&lt;ref name="Pursuit"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tal Ben-Shahar|title=The Pursuit of Perfect: How to Stop Chasing Perfection and Start Living a Richer, Happier Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szotznWmQEYC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=26 July 2011|date=11 March 2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-160882-4|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfectionism can be defined as a persistent compulsive drive toward unattainable goals and valuation based solely in terms of accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parker|first=W. D.|last2=Adkins|first2=K. K.|title = Perfectionism and the gifted|journal=Roeper Review|volume=17|issue=3|pages=173–176|year=1994|doi=10.1080/02783199509553653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfectionists reject the realities and constraints of human ability. They cannot accept failures, delaying any ambitious and productive behavior in fear of failure again.&lt;ref name="horne1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horne|first=Amanda|title=Positive Psychology News Daily|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/amanda-horne/200909035149|accessdate=July 24, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614124828/http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/amanda-horne/200909035149|archivedate=June 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[neuroticism]] can even lead to [[clinical depression]] and low productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Staff|title=Perfectionism: Impossible Dream|newspaper=Psychology Today|date=May 1995|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19950501-000002.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130104131133/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19950501-000002.html|archivedate=2013-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to negative perfectionism, Ben-Shahar suggests the adoption of optimalism. Optimalism allows for failure in pursuit of a goal, and expects that while the trend of activity is towards the positive, it is not necessary to always succeed while striving towards goals. This basis in reality prevents the optimalist from being overwhelmed in the face of failure.&lt;ref name="Pursuit" /&gt;

Optimalists accept failures and also learn from them, which encourages further pursuit of achievement.&lt;ref name="horne1"/&gt; Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar believes that Optimalists and Perfectionists show distinct different motives. Optimalists tend to have more intrinsic, inward desires, with a motivation to learn, while perfectionists are highly motivated by a need to consistently prove themselves worthy.&lt;ref name=Pursuit /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2280">'''Parchmentising''' is a [[textile finishing]] treatment for [[cellulose]] [[fabric]], mainly [[cotton]] and [[flax]], which stiffens the fabric and imparts a degree of translucency.

== Development ==
The process was described in 1850 by [[John Mercer (scientist)|John Mercer]], who treated cotton with solutions of 110–125{{nbsp}}[[Twaddell scale|°Tw]] [[sulfuric acid]], at room temperature, followed by washing. Mercer observed that the treated fabric was soft like fine wool when treated at 110{{nbsp}}°Tw, shrank and stiffened at 114{{nbsp}}°Tw, or shrank, stiffened, and became semi-transparent from 116–125{{nbsp}}°Tw. 
In general, treating indefinitely with concentrations below 110{{nbsp}}°Tw (64%) only swells and shrinks the fabric, while higher concentrations produce the stiff, translucent parchment-like effect in a few seconds, with some loss of tensile strength.&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;{{citation | author=J. T. Marsh | chapter=Dispersion Processes | title=An Introduction To Textile Finishing | year=1948 | pages=121–122 | url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.6810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile makers have combined sulfuric acid treatment with other processes to achieve different effects. For example, [[Mercerising]] cotton fabric before acid treatment appears to make it more susceptible to treatment at lower concentrations of sulfuric acid. At about 106 °Tw the Mercerised lustre is removed and the fabric becomes fuller, softer, and more wool-like, similar to a crêpe. The parchmentising effect is still present at higher concentrations, and may be obtained as low as 107.5 °Tw with somewhat longer treatment, perhaps a few minutes. Acid and alkaline treatments are sometimes applied several times in alternation, and patterns may be created by locally applying a [[resist]] before or between treatments.
At every stage the treatment is stopped by washing and neutralizing the fabric. After acid treatment and washing, a heavy [[calender]], sometimes heated, can be applied to the wet or dried fabric to vary its translucency.&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">The '''Quintana Roo Speleological Survey''' (QRSS) was established in 1990 for the safe exploration, survey and cartography of the underwater and dry [[cave]]s and [[cenote]]s of [[Quintana Roo]], [[Mexico]], supported by the [[National Speleological Society]].&lt;ref name="QRSS2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Survey and Cartography of The Underwater Caves of Quintana Roo Mexico. |journal=The National Speleological Society, Quintana Roo Speleological Survey |date={{Date|2011-02-05|mdy}} |url=http://www.caves.org/project/qrss/ |accessdate={{Date|2011-02-20|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The survey principally acts as a data repository for explored sites within the state of Quintana Roo and distributes summary statistical tables through its webpage, which as of February, 2011 included 208 underwater cave systems with a total surveyed length of {{convert|910.4|km|sp=us}}, and 50 caves above the water table with a total length of {{convert|41.8|km|sp=us}}.

The geographical area for the data archived in the QRSS is essentially the whole of the state of Quintana Roo, which extends along the Caribbean coast of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], from [[Cancun]] and south to the capital of [[Chetumal]] situated on the border with [[Belize]]. The explosive urban and tourism based development within the [[Riviera Maya]] and the [[Costa Maya]] is leading to increasing and widespread environmental stresses. The documentation of the flooded and dry cave networks and cenotes provided by the QRSS is of fundamental importance in regional and site specific scale planning and management of development, water resources, waste disposal facilities, hazardous material handling site selection, and so forth. Certified [[Cave diving|cave divers]] may obtain an information package on underwater survey and cartography opportunities in Quintana Roo.&lt;ref name="QRSS2011" /&gt;

[[File:Cenote Xtoloc en Chichén Itzá.jpg|thumb|350px|The Sacred Cenote at [[Chichen Itza]].]]
The '''Sacred Cenote''' ({{lang-es|cenote sagrado}}, {{IPA-es|ˌsenote saˈɣɾaðo|am}}, "sacred well"; alternatively known as the "Well of Sacrifice") refers to a noted ''[[cenote]]'' at the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site of [[Chichen Itza]], in the northern [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. It is located to the north of Chichen Itza's civic precinct, to which it is connected by a {{convert|300|m|ft|adj=on}} ''[[sacbe]]'', or  raised and paved pathway.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1991), p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god [[Chaac]]. [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of [[gold]], [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]], [[pottery]], and [[incense]], as well as human remains.&lt;ref&gt;Coggins (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with [[human sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;Anda Alanís (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and History==

The northwestern [[Yucatán Peninsula]] is a [[limestone]] plain, with no rivers or streams, lakes or ponds. The region is pockmarked with natural [[sinkhole]]s, called cenotes, which expose the [[water table]] to the surface. One of the most impressive of these is the Sacred Cenote, which is {{convert|60|m|ft}} in diameter&lt;ref name="Cano02p85"&gt;Cano 2002, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounded by sheer cliffs that drop to the water table some {{convert|27|m|ft}} below.

According to ethnohistoric sources, the Sacred Cenote was a place of pilgrimage for ancient Maya people who would conduct sacrifices into it.&lt;ref name="Cano02p85"/&gt; As Friar Diego de Landa observed in 1566 after visiting Chichen Itza:

:"Into this well they have had, and then had, the custom of throwing men alive as a sacrifice to the gods, in times of draught, and they believed that they did not die though they never saw them again. They also threw into it a great many other things, like precious stones and things which they prized. And so, if this country had possessed gold, it would be this well that would have the great part of it."&lt;ref name="Landa41p179-182"&gt;Landa 1941, pp.179-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological explorations of the cenote==

===Edward Herbert Thompson===
[[File:Cenote-Kran.jpg|thumb|200px|Orange-peel dredge used by Thompson 1904-1910 to excavate the Sacred Cenote.]]

Most of the major findings in the cenote were made under the supervision of [[Edward Herbert Thompson]], who began [[dredging]] in 1904. Much of what is known about the dredging process is derived from Thompson’s personal notes. Thompson received money from [[Stephen Salisbury III]] to help him buy the Chichén Itzá excavation site and explore the cenote. Much of Thompson’s findings and research can be found at the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="Sabloff 1994, pp. 34-47"&gt;Sabloff (1994), pp. 34-47&lt;/ref&gt;

A bucket attached to a pulley system was used to dredge the cenote. Much of the beginning work consisted of clearing debris and fallen trees on the top of the water. Leon Cole, a colleague of Thompson, once recorded in his journal, “they made ten hauls in the morning and six or eight in the afternoon.” People would search through the buckets of water looking for artifacts and categorizing them accordingly. Unfortunately, there were several reports of stolen artifacts that could never be found.&lt;ref name="Sabloff 1994, pp. 34-47"/&gt;

Thompson decided to take a break from dredging after Salisbury died. A host of problems, including the [[Mexican Revolution]], and financial issues began to hinder the work effort and damage the morale of the workers. Thompson’s house in Mexico was also burned down, and one of the chests in which he kept his notes and data was destroyed in the fire. By 1923, Thompson was officially done working on the cenote.&lt;ref name="Sabloff 1994, pp. 34-47"/&gt;

===Diving in the cenote===
In 1909, Thompson decided to dive in the cenote to explore the floors, assisted by two Greek divers from [[the Bahamas]]. He reported limited visibility due to the murky water, and many shifting rocks and trees made the dive hazardous.&lt;ref name="Sabloff 1994, pp. 34-47"/&gt; Thompson found a layer about {{Convert|5|m}} thick of blue pigment that had settled on the ground of the cenote. He described the bottom as, “full of long narrow cracks, radiating from centers as if the glass bottom of a dish had been broken by a pointed instrument. We found down in the cracks and holes a grayish mud in which were imbedded the heavier gold objects, jades, and copper bells in numbers.” He later proudly proclaimed, “I have at last personally trod the bottom of the Cenote.”&lt;ref name="Sabloff 1994, pp. 34-47"/&gt;

===Dredging under the Mexican authorities===
In 1961, William Folan, a field director for the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (INAH), helped launch another expedition into the cenote. Some of their notable discoveries included an inscribed, gold-sheathed bone, a large [[chert]] knife with a gold-sheathed wooden handle, and wooden ear flares with jade and turquoise mosaic.

In 1967-1968, Norman Scott and Román Piña Chán led another expedition. They tried two new methods that many people had suggested for a long time: emptying the water out of the cenote and clarifying the water. Both of these methods were only partially successful. Only about {{Convert|4|m}} of water could be removed, and the water was only clarified for a short amount of time.&lt;ref name="Sabloff 1994, pp. 34-47"/&gt;

==Objects found in the Sacred Cenote==

Archaeological investigations support this as thousands of objects have been removed from the bottom of the cenote, including artifacts made from gold, jadeite, copal, pottery, flint, [[obsidian]], shell, wood, rubber, cloth, as well as human skeletons.&lt;ref name="Cano02p85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cogginsp26"&gt;Coggins 1984, pp. 26-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Many perishable objects were preserved by the cenote. Wooden objects which normally would have rotted were preserved in the water. A great variety of wooden objects have been found including weapons, scepters, idols, tools and jewelry. Jade was the largest category of objects found, followed by textiles. The presence of jade, gold and copper in the cenote offers proof of the importance of Chichén Itzá as a cultural city center.

None of these raw materials are native to the Yucatán, which indicates that they were valuable objects brought to Chichén Itzá from other places in Central America and then sacrificed as an act of worship. Pottery, stone, bone and shells were also found in the cenote. Archaeologists have found that many objects show evidence of being intentionally damaged before being thrown into the cenote, and have speculated that this intentional damage is meant to be analogous to “killing” the object as a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Shane (1984), pp. 13-29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice===
Certain cenotes contain a large number of human remains, including both males and females, and young children/infants. According to archaeologist Guillermo de Anda of the University of Yucatán, evidence from Mayan mythology suggests that many young victims (most aged 6 to 12) were male. While the classical images of a female Mayan sacrifice being flung alive to drown in a cenote are pervasive, Guillermo de Anda's writings on the subject suggest that most sacrificial victims — juveniles who were either purchased or captured while their parents were working in the fields, warriors captured in battle, or elites captured during conflicts with neighboring clans — were usually (though not always) killed prior to being thrown into the cenote, and in many cases, dozens of miles from the cenotes in which their bodies were eventually deposited.  He also notes that only a certain set of cenotes was used in this way, while others were reserved for domestic purposes (de Anda 2007). This suggests that Mayan religious officiants believed that only certain cenotes led to the underworld, and sacrifices placed in others would serve no purpose.  It also suggests that the status of the victim as alive or dead was unimportant. The occasional appearance of human remains in non-sacrificial cenotes can be attributed to rare errors in judgement on the part of the shaman. The actual pattern by which a particular victim's remains became interred in which cenotes remains a subject of conjecture.

The Franciscan leader Diego de Landa reported that he witnessed live sacrifices being thrown into the cenote at Chichén Itzá. However, his account does not indicate the regularity of this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Archaeology|volume=58|number=4|author=Kristin Romey|pages=42–49|date=2005|jstor=41781013 | title=Watery tombs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Boniface''' ({{lang-la|Bonifatius}}; {{circa}} 675&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aherne|first1=Consuelo Maria|title=Saint Boniface|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Boniface|website=Britannica|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 5 June 754 [[AD]]), born '''Winfrid''' (also spelled '''Winifred''', '''Wynfrith''', '''Winfrith''' or '''Wynfryth''') in the kingdom of [[Wessex]] in [[Anglo-Saxon England]], was a leading figure in the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]] to the Germanic parts of the [[Frankish Empire]] during the 8th century. He organized Christianity in many parts of [[Germania]] and was made archbishop of [[Mainz]] by [[Pope Gregory III]]. He was [[martyr]]ed in [[Frisia]] in 754, along with 52 others, and his remains were returned to [[Fulda]], where they rest in a [[sarcophagus]] which became a site of pilgrimage. Boniface's life and death as well as his work became widely known, there being a wealth of material available—a number of ''[[Hagiography|vitae]]'', especially the near-contemporary ''Vita Bonifatii auctore Willibaldi'', legal documents, possibly some sermons, and above all his correspondence. He became the [[patron saint]] of Germania, known as the "'''Apostle of the Germans'''".

[[Norman F. Cantor]] notes the three roles Boniface played that made him "one of the truly outstanding creators of the first Europe, as the apostle of Germania, the reformer of the Frankish church, and the chief fomentor of the alliance between the [[papacy]] and the [[Carolingians|Carolingian family]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 167-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his efforts to reorganize and regulate the church of the Franks, he helped shape Western Christianity, and many of the dioceses he proposed remain today. After his martyrdom, he was quickly hailed as a saint in Fulda and other areas in Germania and in England. He is still venerated strongly today by German Catholics. Boniface is celebrated (and criticized)&lt;ref&gt;Van der Goot 1–2, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; as a missionary; he is regarded as a unifier of Europe, and he is seen (mainly by Catholics) as a Germanic national figure.

==Early life and first mission to Frisia==
[[File:Hess Boniface leaves England 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Prayer card, early 20th century, depicting Boniface leaving England]]
The earliest Bonifacian ''vita'', Willibald's, does not mention his place of birth but says that at an early age he attended a monastery ruled by Abbot Wulfhard in ''escancastre'',&lt;ref&gt;Levison 6.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Examchester'',&lt;ref&gt;Talbot 28.&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to denote [[Exeter]], and may have been one of many ''monasteriola'' built by local landowners and churchmen; nothing else is known of it outside the Bonifacian ''vitae''.&lt;ref&gt;Schieffer 76–77; 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt; This monastery is believed to have occupied the site of the [[Church of St Mary Major, Exeter|Church of St Mary Major]] in the [[City of Exeter]], demolished in 1971, next to which was later built [[Exeter Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/_churches/stmarymajor.php St Mary Major - Cathedral Yard'', ''Exeter Memories'' website, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Later tradition places his birth at [[Crediton]], but the earliest mention of Crediton in connection to Boniface is from the early fourteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Orme 97; Hockey 106.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[John Grandisson]]'s ''Legenda Sanctorum: The Proper Lessons for Saints' Days according to the use of Exeter''.&lt;ref&gt;Levison xxix.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his letters Boniface mentions he was "born and reared...[in] the synod of London",&lt;ref&gt;Emerton 81.&lt;/ref&gt; but he may have been speaking metaphorically.&lt;ref&gt;Flechner 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''vitae'', Winfrid was of a respected and prosperous family. Against his father's wishes he devoted himself at an early age to the monastic life. He received further theological training in the [[Benedictine]] monastery and [[Minster (church)|minster]] of [[Nursling|Nhutscelle (Nursling)]],&lt;ref&gt;Levison 9.&lt;/ref&gt; not far from [[Winchester]], which under the direction of abbot Winbert had grown into an industrious centre of learning in the tradition of [[Aldhelm]].&lt;ref&gt;Schieffer 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Winfrid taught in the abbey school and at the age of 30 became a priest; in this time, he wrote a Latin grammar, the ''Ars Grammatica'', besides a treatise on verse and some [[Aldhelm]]-inspired riddles.&lt;ref&gt;Gneuss 38.&lt;/ref&gt; While little is known about Nursling outside of Boniface's ''vitae'', it seems clear that the library there was significant. In order to supply Boniface with the materials he needed, it would have contained works by [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]], [[Priscian]], [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Gneuss 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 716, when his abbot Wynberth of Nursling died, he was invited (or expected) to assume his position—it is possible that they were related, and the practice of hereditary right among the early Anglo-Saxons would affirm this.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke.&lt;/ref&gt; Winfrid, however, declined the position and in 716 set out on a [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary expedition]] to [[Frisia]].

Boniface first left for the continent in 716. He traveled to [[Utrecht]], where [[Willibrord]], the "Apostle of the Frisians," had been working since the 690s. He spent a year with Willibrord, preaching in the countryside, but their efforts were frustrated by the war then being carried on between [[Charles Martel]] and [[Radbod, King of the Frisians]]. Willibrord fled to the abbey he had founded in [[Echternach]] (in modern-day [[Luxembourg]]) while Boniface returned to Nursling.

Boniface returned to the continent the next year and went straight to Rome, where [[Pope Gregory II]] renamed him "Boniface", after the (legendary) fourth-century martyr [[Boniface of Tarsus]], and appointed him missionary bishop for [[Germania]]—he became a bishop without a diocese for an area that lacked any church organization. He would never return to England, though he remained in correspondence with his countrymen and kinfolk throughout his life.

According to the ''vitae'' Boniface felled the [[Donar Oak]], Latinized by Willibald as "Jupiter's oak," near the present-day town of [[Fritzlar]] in northern [[Hesse]]. According to his early biographer Willibald, Boniface started to chop the oak down, when suddenly a great wind, as if by miracle, blew the ancient oak over. When the god did not strike him down, the people were amazed and converted to Christianity. He built a chapel dedicated to [[Saint Peter]] from its wood at the site&lt;ref&gt;Levison 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;—the chapel was the beginning of the monastery in Fritzlar. This account from the ''vita'' is stylized to portray Boniface as a singular character who alone acts to root out paganism. Lutz von Padberg and others point out that what the ''vitae'' leave out is that the action was most likely well-prepared and widely publicized in advance for maximum effect, and that Boniface had little reason to fear for his personal safety since the Frankish fortified settlement of [[Büraburg]] was nearby.&lt;ref&gt;von Padberg 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Willibald, Boniface later had a church with an attached monastery built in Fritzlar,&lt;ref&gt;Levison 35.&lt;/ref&gt; on the site of the previously built chapel, according to tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rau 494 n.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boniface and the Carolingians==

[[File:St Boniface - Baptising-Martyrdom - Sacramentary of Fulda - 11Century.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Fulda Sacramentary, Saint Boniface baptizing (top) and being martyred (bottom)]]
The support of the [[Franks|Frankish]] mayors of the palace ([[maior domo]]s), and later the early [[Pippinid]] and [[Carolingians|Carolingian]] rulers, was essential for Boniface's work. Boniface had been under the protection of [[Charles Martel]] from 723 on. The Christian Frankish leaders desired to defeat their rival power, the non-Christian Saxons, and to incorporate the Saxon lands into their own growing empire. Boniface's campaign of destruction of [[Germanic paganism|indigenous Germanic pagan]] sites may have benefited the Franks in their campaign against the Saxons.

In 732, Boniface traveled again to Rome to report, and [[Pope Gregory III]] conferred upon him the [[pallium]] as archbishop with jurisdiction over Germany. Boniface again set out for what is now Germany, continued his mission, and used his authority to resolve the problems of many other Christians who had fallen out of contact with the regular hierarchy of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. During his third visit to Rome in 737–38, he was made [[papal legate]] for Germany.

After Boniface's third trip to Rome, Charles Martel erected four dioceses in Bavaria ([[Bishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]], [[Bishopric of Regensburg|Regensburg]], [[Bishopric of Freising|Freising]], and [[Bishopric of Passau|Passau]]) and gave them to Boniface as [[archbishop]] and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] over all Germany east of the Rhine. In 745, he was granted Mainz as metropolitan see. In 742, one of his disciples, [[Saint Sturm|Sturm]] (also known as Sturmi, or Sturmius), founded the [[Fulda monastery|abbey of Fulda]] not far from Boniface's earlier missionary outpost at Fritzlar. Although Sturm was the founding abbot of Fulda, Boniface was very involved in the foundation. The initial grant for the abbey was signed by [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]], the son of [[Charles Martel]], and a supporter of Boniface's reform efforts in the Frankish church. The saint himself explained to his old friend, Daniel of Winchester, that without the protection of Charles Martel he could "neither administer his church, defend his clergy, nor prevent idolatry."

According to German historian Gunther Wolf, the high point of Boniface's career was the [[Concilium Germanicum]], organized by Carloman in an unknown location in April 743. Although Boniface was not able to safeguard the church from property seizures by the local nobility, he did achieve one goal, the adoption of stricter guidelines for the Frankish clergy,&lt;ref&gt;Wolf 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt; which often hailed directly from the nobility. After Carloman's resignation in 747 he maintained a sometimes turbulent relationship with the king of the [[Franks]], [[Pippin III|Pepin]]; the claim that he would have crowned Pepin at [[Soissons]] in 751 is now generally discredited.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boniface balanced this support and attempted to maintain some independence, however, by attaining the support of the [[papacy]] and of the [[Agilolfing]] rulers of [[Bavaria]]. In Frankish, Hessian, and Thuringian territory, he established the dioceses of [[Würzburg]], and [[Erfurt]]. By appointing his own followers as bishops, he was able to retain some independence from the Carolingians, who most likely were content to give him leeway as long as Christianity was imposed on the Saxons and other Germanic tribes.

==Last mission to Frisia==
[[File:Sint-Bonifatiuscrypte Fulda.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Boniface crypt, Fulda]]
According to the ''vitae'', Boniface had never relinquished his hope of converting the [[Frisians]], and in 754 he set out with a retinue for Frisia. He baptized a great number and summoned a general meeting for confirmation at a place not far from [[Dokkum]], between [[Franeker]] and [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Instead of his converts, however, a group of armed robbers appeared who slew the aged archbishop. The ''vitae'' mention that Boniface persuaded his (armed) comrades to lay down their arms: "Cease fighting. Lay down your arms, for we are told in Scripture not to render evil for good but to overcome evil by good."&lt;ref&gt;Talbot 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having killed Boniface and his company, the Frisian bandits ransacked their possessions but found that the company's luggage did not contain the riches they had hoped for: "they broke open the chests containing the books and found, to their dismay, that they held manuscripts instead of gold vessels, pages of sacred texts instead of silver plates."&lt;ref&gt;Talbot 57.&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to destroy these books, the earliest ''vita'' already says, and this account underlies the status of the [[Ragyndrudis Codex]], now held as a Bonifacian relic in Fulda, and supposedly one of three books found on the field by the Christians who inspected it afterward. Of those three books, the Ragyndrudis Codex shows incisions that could have been made by sword or axe; its story appears confirmed in the Utrecht hagiography, the ''Vita altera'', which reports that an eye-witness saw that the saint at the moment of death held up a [[gospel]] as spiritual protection.&lt;ref&gt;Schieffer 272-73.&lt;/ref&gt; The story was later repeated by Otloh's ''vita''; at that time, the Ragyndrudis Codex seems to have been firmly connected to the martyrdom.

Boniface's remains were moved from the Frisian countryside to Utrecht, and then to Mainz, where sources contradict each other regarding the behavior of [[Lullus]], Boniface's successor as archbishop of Mainz. According to Willibald's ''vita'' Lullus allowed the body to be moved to Fulda, while the (later) ''Vita Sturmi'', a hagiography of Sturm by [[Eigil of Fulda]], Lullus attempted to block the move and keep the body in Mainz.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

His remains were eventually buried in the abbey church of Fulda after resting for some time in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and they are entombed within a shrine beneath the high altar of [[Fulda Cathedral]], previously the abbey church.

==Veneration==

===Fulda===
Veneration of Boniface in Fulda began immediately after his death; his grave was equipped with a decorative tomb around ten years after his burial, and the grave and relics became the center of the abbey. Fulda monks prayed for newly elected abbots at the grave site before greeting them, and every Monday the saint was remembered in prayer, the monks prostrating themselves and reciting [[Psalm 50]]. After the abbey church was rebuilt to become the [[Ratgar Basilica]] (dedicated 791), Boniface's remains were [[Translation (relic)|translated]] to a new grave: since the church had been enlarged, his grave, originally in the west, was now in the middle; his relics were moved to a new [[apse]] in 819. From then on Boniface, as [[Jus patronatus|patron]] of the abbey, was regarded as both spiritual intercessor for the monks and legal owner of the abbey and its possessions, and all donations to the abbey were done in his name. He was honored on the date of  his martyrdom, 5 June (with a mass written by [[Alcuin]]), and (around the year 1000) with a mass dedicated to his appointment as bishop, on 1 December.&lt;ref&gt;Kehl, "Entstehung und Verbreitung" 128-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dokkum===
Willibald's ''vita'' describes how a visitor on horseback come to the site of the martyrdom, and a hoof of his horse got stuck in the mire. When it was pulled loose, a well sprang up. By the time of the ''Vita altera Bonifatii'' (9th century), there was a church on the site, and the well had become a "fountain of sweet water" used to sanctify people. The ''Vita Liudgeri'', a hagiographical account of the work of [[Ludger]], describes how Ludger himself had built the church, sharing duties with two other priests. According to James Palmer, the well was of great importance since the saint's body was hundreds of miles away; the physicality of the well allowed for an ongoing connection with the saint. In addition, Boniface signified Dokkum's and Frisia's "connect[ion] to the rest of (Frankish) Christendom".&lt;ref&gt;Palmer 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
[[File:Bonifatius Fritzlar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Saint Boniface memorial in [[Fritzlar]], Germany]]
Saint Boniface's [[feast day]] is celebrated on 5 June in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Lutheran Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

A famous statue of Saint Boniface stands on the grounds of [[Mainz Cathedral]], seat of the [[archbishop of Mainz]]. A more modern rendition stands facing St. Peter's Church of Fritzlar.

The UK National Shrine is located at the Catholic church at [[Crediton]], Devon, which has a [[bas-relief]] of the felling of Thor's Oak, by sculptor Kenneth Carter. The sculpture was unveiled by [[Princess Margaret]] in his native [[Crediton]], located in Newcombes Meadow Park. There is also a series of paintings there by Timothy Moore. There are quite a few churches dedicated to St. Boniface in the United Kingdom: [[Bunbury, Cheshire]]; [[Chandler's Ford]] and [[Southampton]] Hampshire; Adler Street, London; [[Papa Westray]], Orkney; [[St Budeaux]], Plymouth (now demolished); [[Bonchurch]], Isle of Wight; [[Cullompton]], Devon.

Bishop [[George Errington (bishop)|George Errington]] founded [[St Boniface's Catholic College]], Plymouth in 1856. The school celebrates Saint Boniface on 5 June each year.

In 1818, Father [[Norbert Provencher]] founded a mission on the east bank of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] in what was then [[Rupert's Land]], building a log church and naming it after St. Boniface. The log church was consecrated as [[Saint Boniface Cathedral]] after Provencher was himself consecrated as a bishop and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Boniface|diocese]] was formed. The community that grew around the cathedral eventually became the city of [[Saint Boniface, Winnipeg|Saint Boniface]], which merged into the city of [[Winnipeg]] in 1971. In 1844, four [[Grey Nuns]] arrived by canoe in Manitoba, and in 1871, built Western Canada's first hospital: [[St. Boniface General Hospital (Winnipeg)|St. Boniface Hospital]], where the Assiniboine and Red Rivers meet. Today, St. Boniface Hospital is the second-largest hospital in Manitoba.

==Legends==
Some traditions credit Saint Boniface with the invention of the [[Christmas tree]]. The ''vitae'' mention nothing of the sort. However, it is mentioned on a [[BBC]]-Devon website, in an account which places Geismar in [[Bavaria]],&lt;ref&gt;"Devon Myths and Legends."&lt;/ref&gt; and in a number of educational books, including ''St. Boniface and the Little Fir Tree'',&lt;ref&gt;Melmoth, Jenny and Val Hayward (1999). ''St. Boniface and the Little Fir Tree: A Story to Color''. Warrington: Alfresco Books. {{ISBN|1-873727-15-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Brightest Star of All: Christmas Stories for the Family'',&lt;ref&gt;Papa, Carrie (2008).

==Sources and writings==
[[File:Bonifatiusstatue Fulda.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Boniface statue in [[Fulda]], Germany]]

===''Vitae''===
The earliest "Life" of Boniface was written by a certain Willibald, an Anglo-Saxon priest who came to [[Mainz]] after Boniface's death,&lt;ref&gt;This is not the Willibald who was appointed by Boniface as [[Willibald|Bishop of Eichstatt]]: "The writer of the Life was a simple priest who had never come into direct contact with Boniface and what he says is based upon the facts that he was able to collect from those who had been Boniface's disciples." Talbot 24.&lt;/ref&gt; around 765. Willibald's biography was widely dispersed; Levison lists some forty manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Levison xvii–xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his lemma, a group of four manuscripts including Codex Monacensis 1086 are copies directly from the original.&lt;ref&gt;Levison xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Listed second in Levison's edition is the entry from a late ninth-century Fulda document: Boniface's status as a martyr is attested by his inclusion in the ''Fulda Martyrology'' which also lists, for instance, the date (1 November) of his [[Translation (relic)|translation]] in 819, when the [[Fulda Cathedral]] had been rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Levison xlvii.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Vita Bonifacii'' was written in Fulda in the ninth century, possibly by [[Candidus of Fulda]], but is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Hessisches Jahrbuch für Landesgeschichte]]|title=Neue Hinweise zum Rechtsstatus des Klosters Fulda aus der ''Vita Aegil'' des Brun Candidus|first=Gereon|last=Becht-Jördens|year=1991|volume=41|pages=11–29|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next ''vita'', chronologically, is the ''Vita altera Bonifatii auctore Radbodo'', which originates in the [[Bishopric of Utrecht]], and was probably revised by [[Radboud of Utrecht]] (899–917). Mainly agreeing with Willibald, it adds an eye-witness who presumably saw the martyrdom at Dokkum. The ''Vita tertia Bonifatii'' likewise originates in Utrecht. It is dated between 917 (Radboud's death) and 1075, the year [[Adam of Bremen]] wrote his ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'', which used the ''Vita tertia''.&lt;ref&gt;Levison lvi–lviii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haarländer.&lt;/ref&gt;

A later ''vita'', written by [[Otloh of St. Emmeram]] (1062–1066), is based on Willibald's and a number of other ''vitae'' as well as the correspondence, and also includes information from local traditions.

===Correspondence===
Boniface engaged in regular correspondence with fellow churchmen all over Western Europe, including the three popes he worked with, and with some of his kinsmen back in England. Many of these letters contain questions about church reform and liturgical or doctrinal matters. In most cases, what remains is one half of the conversation, either the question or the answer. The correspondence as a whole gives evidence of Boniface's widespread connections; some of the letters also prove an intimate relationship especially with female correspondents.&lt;ref name="Noble xxxiv–xxxv"&gt;Noble xxxiv–xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 150 letters in what is generally called the Bonifatian correspondence, though not all them are by Boniface or addressed to him. They were assembled by order of archbishop [[Lullus]], Boniface's successor in Mainz, and were initially organized into two parts, a section containing the papal correspondence and another with his private letters. They were reorganized in the eighth century, in a roughly chronological ordering. Otloh of St. Emmeram, who worked on a new ''vita'' of Boniface in the eleventh century, is credited with compiling the complete correspondence as we have it.&lt;ref name="Noble xxxiv–xxxv"/&gt;

The correspondence was edited and published already in the seventeenth century, by Nicolaus Serarius.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistolae s. Bonifacii martyris, primi moguntini archiepiscopi'', published in 1605 in Mainz and republished in 1625, and again in 1639, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephan Alexander Würdtwein's 1789 edition, ''Epistolae S. Bonifacii Archiepiscopi Magontini'', was the basis for a number of (partial) translations in the nineteenth century. The first version to be published by [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]] (MGH) was the edition by Ernst Dümmler (1892); the most authoritative version until today is Michael Tangl's 1912 ''Die Briefe des Heiligen Bonifatius, Nach der Ausgabe in den Monumenta Germaniae Historica'', published by MGH in 1916.&lt;ref name="Noble xxxiv–xxxv"/&gt; This edition is the basis of [[Ephraim Emerton]]'s selection and translation in English, ''The Letters of Saint Boniface'', first published in New York in 1940; it was republished most recently with a new introduction by Thomas F.X. Noble in 2000.

===Sermons===
{{main|Sermones (Pseudo)-Bonifatii}}
Some fifteen preserved sermons are traditionally associated with Boniface, but that they were actually his is not generally accepted.

===Grammar and poetry===
Early in his career, before he left for the continent, Boniface wrote the ''[[Ars Bonifacii]]'', a grammatical treatise presumably for his students in Nursling. [[Helmut Gneuss]] reports that one manuscript copy of the treatise originates from (the south of) England, mid-eighth century; it is now held in [[Marburg]], in the [[Hessisches Staatsarchiv Marburg|Hessisches Staatsarchiv]].&lt;ref&gt;Gneuss 130, item 849.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a treatise on verse, the ''Caesurae uersuum'', and a collection of [[riddle]]s, the ''Enigmata'', influenced greatly by [[Aldhelm]] and containing many references to works of [[Vergil]] (the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the ''[[Georgics]]'', and the ''[[Eclogues]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Lapidge 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Three octosyllabic poems written in clearly Aldhelmian fashion (according to [[Andy Orchard]]) are preserved in his correspondence, all composed before he left for the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Orchard 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional materials===
A letter by Boniface charging [[Adalbert (mystic)|Aldebert]] and Clement with heresy is preserved in the records of the Roman Council of 745 that condemned the two.&lt;ref name="Meeder"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meeder|first=Sven|year=2011|title=Boniface and the Irish Heresy of Clemens|journal=[[American Society of Church History#Church History|Church History]]|volume=80|issue=2|pages=251–80|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8274031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boniface had an interest in the Irish canon law collection known as ''[[Collectio canonum Hibernensis]]'', and a late 8th/early 9th-century manuscript in [[Würzburg]] contains, besides a selection from the ''Hibernensis'', a list of rubrics that mention the heresies of Clemens and Aldebert. The relevant folios containing these rubrics were most likely copied in Mainz, Würzburg, or Fulda, all places associated with Boniface.&lt;ref name="Meeder"/&gt; [[Michael Glatthaar]] suggested that the rubrics should be seen as Boniface's contribution to the agenda for a synod.&lt;ref&gt;Glatthaar 134-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anniversary and other celebrations==
Boniface's death (and birth) has given rise to a number of noteworthy celebrations. The dates for some of these celebrations have undergone some changes: in 1805, 1855, and 1905 (and in England in 1955) anniversaries were calculated with Boniface's death dated in 755, the "Mainz tradition"; in Mainz, [[Michael Tangl]]'s dating of the martyrdom in 754 was not accepted until after 1955. Celebrations in Germany centered on Fulda and Mainz, in the Netherlands on Dokkum and Utrecht, and in England on Crediton and Exeter.

===Celebrations in Germany: 1805, 1855, 1905===
[[File:1905 boniface coin.jpg|image|thumb|left|upright|Medal minted for the Boniface anniversary in Fulda, 1905]]
The first German celebration on a fairly large scale was held in 1805 (the 1050th anniversary of his death), followed by a similar celebration in a number of towns in 1855; both of these were predominantly Catholic affairs, which emphasized the role of Boniface in German history. But if the celebrations were mostly Catholic, in the first part of the 19th century the respect for Boniface in general was an ecumenical affair, with both Protestants and Catholics praising Boniface as a founder of the German nation, in response to the German nationalism that arose after the Napoleonic era came to an end. The second part of the 19th century saw increased tension between Catholics and Protestants; for the latter, [[Martin Luther]] had become the model German, the founder of the modern nation, and he and Boniface were in direct competition for the honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Siegfried|last=Weichlein|chapter=Bonifatius als politischer Heiliger im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert|title=Bonifatius: Vom angelsächsischen Missionar zum Apostel der Deutschen|editor1-first=Michael|editor1-last=Imhof|editor2-first=Gregor K.|editor2-last=Stasch|location=Petersberg|year=2004|pages=219-34|publisher=Michael Imhof Verlag|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, when strife between Catholic and Protestant factions had eased (one Protestant church published a celebratory pamphlet, Gerhard Ficker's ''Bonifatius, der "Apostel der Deutschen"''), there were modest celebrations and a publication for the occasion on historical aspects of Boniface and his work, the 1905 ''Festgabe'' by Gregor Richter and Carl Scherer. In all, the content of these early celebrations showed evidence of the continuing question about the meaning of Boniface for Germany, though the importance of Boniface in cities associated with him was without question.&lt;ref&gt;Nichtweiß 283-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1954 celebrations===
In 1954, celebrations were widespread, in England, Germany, and the Netherlands, and a number of these celebrations were international affairs. Especially in Germany, these celebrations had a distinctly political note to them and often stressed Boniface as a kind of founder of Europe, such as when [[Konrad Adenauer]], the (Catholic) German chancellor, addressed a crowd of 60,000 in Fulda, celebrating the feast day of the saint in a European context: "Das, was wir in Europa gemeinsam haben, [ist] gemeinsamen Ursprungs" ("What we have in common in Europe comes from the same source").&lt;ref&gt;Pralle 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papal visit, 1980===
When [[Pope John Paul II]] [[List of pastoral visits of Pope John Paul II outside Italy|visited Germany]] in November 1980, he spent two days in Fulda (17 and 18 November). He celebrated mass in Fulda Cathedral with 30,000 gathered on the square in front of the building, and met with the [[German Bishops' Conference]] (held in Fulda since 1867). The pope next celebrated mass outside the cathedral, in front of an estimated crowd of 100,000, and hailed the importance of Boniface for German Christianity: "Der heilige Bonifatius, Bischof und Märtyrer, ''bedeutet'' den 'Anfang' des Evangeliums und der Kirche in Eurem Land" ("The holy Boniface, bishop and martyr, ''signifies'' the beginning of the gospel and the church in your country").&lt;ref&gt;Grave 134.&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph of the pope praying at Boniface's grave became the centerpiece of a prayer card distributed from the cathedral.

===2004 celebrations===
In 2004, anniversary celebrations were held throughout Northwestern Germany and Utrecht, and Fulda and Mainz—generating a great amount of academic and popular interest. The event occasioned a number of scholarly studies, esp. biographies (for instance, by Auke Jelsma in Dutch, Lutz von Padberg in German, and Klaas Bruinsma in Frisian), and a fictional completion of the Boniface correspondence (Lutterbach, ''Mit Axt und Evangelium'').&lt;ref&gt;Aaij.&lt;/ref&gt; A German musical proved a great commercial success,&lt;ref&gt;Hartl.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Netherlands an opera was staged.&lt;ref&gt;Henk Alkema (music) and Peter te Nuyl (libretto). ''Bonifacius''. Leewarden, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship on Boniface==
The literature on the saint and his work is extensive. At the time of the various anniversaries, edited collections were published containing essays by some of the best-known scholars of the time, such as the 1954 collection ''Sankt Bonifatius: Gedenkgabe zum Zwölfhundertsten Todestag''&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Cuno Raabe et al., Fulda: Parzeller, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2004 collection ''Bonifatius—Vom Angelsächsischen Missionar zum Apostel der Deutschen''.&lt;ref&gt;Eds. Michael Imhof and Gregor Stasch, Petersberg: Michael Imhof, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, [[:de:Lutz E. von Padberg|Lutz von Padberg]] published a number of biographies and articles on the saint focusing on his missionary praxis and his relics. The most authoritative biography is still [[Theodor Schieffer]]'s ''Winfrid-Bonifatius und die Christliche Grundlegung Europas'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann 193: "In dem auch heute noch als Standardwerk anerkannten Buch ''Winfrid-Bonifatius und die christlichen Grundlegung Europas'' von Theodor Schieffer..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mostert|first=Marco|authorlink=Marco Mostertyear=1995|title=Bonifatius als geschiedsvervalser|journal=Madoc|volume=9|issue=3|pages=213–21|quote=...een nog steeds niet achterhaalde biografie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharps waste''' is a form of [[biomedical waste]] composed of used "sharps", which includes any device or object used to puncture or lacerate the skin.  Sharps waste is classified as [[Biological hazard|biohazardous]] waste and must be carefully handled.  Common medical materials treated as sharps waste are:

* [[Hypodermic needles]]
* Disposable [[scalpel]]s and blades
* Contaminated [[glass]] and some [[plastic]]s

== Qualifying materials ==
In addition to needles and blades, anything attached to them will also be considered sharps waste, such syringes and injection devices.

Blades can include [[razor]]s, [[scalpel]]s, [[X-Acto knife]], [[scissors]], or any other medical items used for cutting in the medical setting, regardless of if they have been contaminated with biohazardous material. While glass and sharp plastic are considered sharps waste, their handling methods can vary.

Glass items which have been contaminated with a biohazardous material will be treated with the same concern as needles and blades, even if unbroken. If glass is contaminated, it is still often treated as a sharp, because it can break during the disposal process. Contaminated plastic items which are not sharp can be disposed of in a [[biohazardous waste]] receptacle instead of a sharps container.

==Dangers involved ==

As a [[Biological hazard|biohazardous]] material, injuries from sharps waste can pose a large public health concern.  By penetrating the skin, it is possible for this waste to spread blood-borne pathogens.  The spread of these pathogens is directly responsible for the transmission of [[blood-borne disease]]s, such as [[hepatitis B]] (HBV), [[hepatitis C]] (HCV), and [[HIV]].  Health care professionals expose themselves to the risk of transmission of these diseases when handling sharps waste. The large volume handled by health care professionals on a daily basis increases the chance that an injury may occur.

The general public can occasionally be at risk to injuries from sharps waste as well when improperly disposed of by injection drug users.

== Sharps containers ==
[[File:Sharps Container.jpg|right|thumb|A [[#sharps containers|sharps container]] is specially designed for safe disposal of sharps waste.]]

A '''sharps container''' is a hard [[plastic container]] that is used to safely dispose of [[hypodermic needle]]s and other sharp medical instruments, such as an [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] catheters and disposable scalpels. Sharps containers may be single use which are disposed of with the waste inside, or reusable which are robotically emptied and sterilized before being returned for re-use.

Needles are dropped into the container through an opening in the top. Needles should never be pushed or forced into the container, as damage to the container and/or [[needlestick injury|needlestick injuries]] may result. Sharps containers should not be filled above the indicated line, usually two-thirds full.

In North America, sharps containers are often red, and elsewhere are often yellow.

Airports and large institutions commonly have sharps containers available in restrooms for safe disposal for users of injection drugs, such as insulin-dependent [[diabetic]]s. People injecting drugs in their homes may substitute other hard-sided containers such as empty milk jugs for disposal of needles.

Extreme care must be taken in the [[waste management|management]] and disposal of sharps waste. The goal in sharps waste management is to safely handle all materials until they can be properly disposed. The final step in the disposal of sharps waste is to dispose of them in an [[autoclave]]. A less common approach is to [[incinerate]] them; typically only [[chemotherapy]] sharps waste is incinerated. Steps must be taken along the way to minimize the risk of injury from this material, while maximizing the amount of sharps material disposed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
 
Health care workers are to minimize their interaction with sharps waste by disposing of it in a sealable container. Attempts by health care workers to disassemble sharps waste is kept to a minimum. Strict [[hospital]] protocols and government regulations ensure that hospital workers handle sharps waste safely and dispose of it effectively.

Self-locking and sealable sharps containers are made of plastic so that the sharps can not easily penetrate through the sides. Such units are designed so that the whole container can be disposed of with other biohazardous waste. Single use [[sharps container]]s of various sizes are sold throughout the world. Large medical facilities may have their own 'mini' autoclave in which these sharps containers are disposed of with other medical wastes. This minimizes the distance the containers have to travel and the number of people to come in contact with the sharps waste. Smaller clinics or offices without such facilities are required by federal regulations to hire the services of a company that specializes in transporting and properly disposing of the hazardous wastes.

NIOSH found through results from focus groups that accommodation, functionality, accessibility, and visibility are four areas of high importance to be able to ensure safe discarding of sharps. The studies found it was important to have containers that are easy to use with little need for training to be able to use. The containers should be visible in any areas that sharps are used and be placed in such degree that spillage and injury will not be likely to occur with use.&lt;ref&gt;URL=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/stopsticks/sharpsdisposal.html. Title= "Stop Sticks Campaign". Publisher= NIOSH. date of access= 17. September 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent legislation in [[France]] has stated that pharmaceutical companies supplying self injection medications are responsible for the disposal of spent needles. Previously popular needle clippers and caps are no longer acceptable as safety devices and either sharps box or needle destruction devices are required.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Disposal methods vary by country and locale, but common methods of disposal are either by truck service or, in the [[United States]], by disposal of sharps through the mail. Truck service involves trained personnel collecting sharps waste, and often [[medical waste]], at the point of generation and hauling it away by truck to a destruction facility. Similarly, the mail-back sharps disposal method allows generators to ship sharps waste to the disposal facility directly through the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. mail]] in specially designed and approved shipping containers. Mail-back sharps disposal allows waste generators to dispose of smaller amounts of sharps more economically than if they were to hire out a truck service.

== Injection technology ==

With more than sixteen billion injections administered annually worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uqconnect.net/signfiles/Files/ScopeOfWorkNeedleRemoversDraft5.pdf WHO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525023731/http://www.uqconnect.net/signfiles/Files/ScopeOfWorkNeedleRemoversDraft5.pdf |date=2006-05-25 }} World Health Organization (2004).  Proposed agenda to evaluate the risks and benefits associated with using needle-removing devices.  Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;  they are the largest contributor to sharps waste. For this reason many new technologies surrounding injections have been developed, mostly related to safety mechanisms. As these technologies have been developed governments have attempted to make them commonplace to ensure sharps waste safety.  In 2000, the [[Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act]] was passed, along with the 2001 [[Bloodborne Pathogens Standard]].&lt;ref&gt;Jagger, J., De Carli, G., Perry, J., Puro, V., Ippolito, G. (2003). Chapter 31: Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens: Epidemiology and Prevention. Prevention and Control of Nosocomial Infections (4th Ed). Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Safety syringes]] help reduce occurrences of accidental needlesticks. One of the most recent developments has been the auto-disable injection device. These injection devices automatically disable after a single use. This can be done by retracting the needle back into the syringe or rendering the syringe plunger inoperable. With the injection device now inoperable, it cannot be reused. Shielding the needle after the injection is another approach for safe management of sharps. These are hands free methods usually involving a hinging cap that can be pressed on a table to seal the needle. Another technology in sharps waste management relating to injections is the [[needle remover]]. Varying approaches can be taken with the main goal to separate the needle from the syringe. This allows the sharp needle to be quarantined and disposed of separate from the syringe. There is debate around the use of these devices as they involved in additional step in the handling of sharps waste.

== In the developing world ==

Sharps waste is of great concern in [[developing world|developing]] and transitional regions of the world. Factors such as high disease prevalence and lack of health care professionals amplify the dangers involved with sharps waste, and the cost of newer disposal technology makes them unlikely to be used. 
As with the rest of the world injection wastes make up the largest portion of sharps waste. However, injection use is much more prevalent in this world segment. One of the contributors to this increase is a larger emphasis placed on injections for therapeutic purposes.  It has been estimated that 95% of all injections in developing regions are for therapeutic purposes.&lt;ref name="Simonsen"&gt;Simonsen, L.  Kane, A.  Lloyd, J.  Zaffran, M.  Kane, M (1999).  Unsafe injections in the developing world and transmission of bloodborne pathogens: a review.  Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 77(10).&lt;/ref&gt; The average person has been estimated to receive up to 8.5 injections per year.&lt;ref name="Simonsen" /&gt; Newly developed injection technologies are rarely used to provide these injections due to added costs. Therefore, the majority of injections are given with standard disposable syringes in developing regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthcarewaste.org/documents/PATH_needleRemover_design.pdf Needle Remover] Harner, C. (2004, October). Needle Remover Device Design Transfer Package. Retrieved September 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The infrastructure of developing regions is not equipped to deal with this large volume of contaminated sharps waste.  Contrary to the industrialized world, disposal incinerators and transportation networks are not always available.  Cost restraints make the purchase of single use disposable containers unrealistic. Facilities are often overwhelmed with patients and understaffed with educated workers. Demand on these facilities can limit the emphasis or enforcement of waste disposal protocols. These factors leave a dangerous quantity of sharps waste in the environment. Contrasts between the industrialized and developing world segment can be seen in accidental needle stick injuries. These occur at a rate of .18 to .74 per person per year in industrialized nations and .93 to 4.68 per person per year in developing and transitional nations (Hutin, Hauri, Armstrong, 2003).&lt;!-- What is this citation?--&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Improper sharps management is a major factor involved in what is categorized as unsafe injections. Annually these account for 21 million, 2 million, and 260,000 of new HBV, HCV, and HIV infections annually.&lt;ref&gt;Dziekan G, Chisolm D, Johns B, Rovira J, Hutin Y (2003).

'''Space-based measurements of carbon dioxide''' ({{CO2|link=yes}}) are used to help answer questions about Earth's [[carbon cycle]]. There are a variety of active and planned instruments for measuring [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]] from space. The first satellite mission designed to measure {{CO2}} was the Interferometric Monitor for Greenhouse Gases (IMG) on board the [[ADEOS I]] satellite in 1996. This mission lasted less than a year. Since then, additional space-based measurements have begun, including those from two high-precision (better than 0.3% or 1 ppm) satellites ([[Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite|GOSAT]] and [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2|OCO-2]]). Different instrument designs may reflect different primary missions.

==Purposes and highlights of findings==
There are outstanding questions in [[carbon cycle]] science that satellite observations can help answer. The Earth system absorbs about half of all [[Anthropogenic greenhouse gases|anthropogenic]] {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref name="Schimel2007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Carbon cycle conundrums |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |last1=Schimel |first1=David |volume=104 |issue=47 |pages=18353–18354 |date=November 2007 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0709331104 |bibcode=2007PNAS..10418353S |pmc=2141782}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear exactly how this uptake is partitioned to different regions across the globe. It is also uncertain how different regions will behave in terms of {{CO2}} flux under a different climate. For example, a forest may increase {{CO2}} uptake due to the [[CO2 fertilization effect|fertilization]] or β-effect,&lt;ref name="Schimel2015"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effect of increasing CO2on the terrestrial carbon cycle |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |last1=Schimel |first1=David |last2=Stephens |first2=Britton B. |last3=Fisher |first3=Joshua B. |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=436–441 |date=January 2015 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1407302112 |bibcode=2015PNAS..112..436S |pmc=4299228}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it could release {{CO2}} due to increased metabolism by microbes at higher temperatures.&lt;ref name="Cox2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sensitivity of tropical carbon to climate change constrained by carbon dioxide variability |journal=Nature |last1=Cox |first1=Peter M. |last2=Pearson |first2=David |last3=Booth |first3=Ben B. |last4=Friedlingstein |first4=Pierre |last5=Huntingford |first5=Chris |last6=Jones |first6=Chris D. |last7=Luke |first7=Catherine M. |display-authors=3 |volume=494 |issue=7437 |pages=341–344 |date=February 2013 |doi=10.1038/nature11882 |bibcode=2013Natur.494..341C}}&lt;/ref&gt; These questions are difficult to answer with historically spatially and temporally limited data sets.

Even though satellite observations of {{CO2}} are somewhat recent, they have been used for a number of different purposes, some of which are highlighted here.
*[[Megacity]] {{CO2}} enhancements were observed with the [[GOSAT]] satellite and minimum observable space-based changes in emissions were estimated.&lt;ref name="Kort2012"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Space-based observations of megacity carbon dioxide |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |last1=Kort |first1=Eric A. |last2=Frankenberg |first2=Christian |last3=Miller |first3=Charles E. |last4=Oda |first4=Tom |display-authors=3 |volume=39 |issue=17 |date=September 2012 |at=L17806 |doi=10.1029/2012GL052738 |bibcode=2012GeoRL..3917806K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
[[Remote sensing]] of [[trace gas]]es has several challenges. Most techniques rely on observing [[infrared]] light reflected off Earth's surface. Because these instruments use [[spectroscopy]], at each sounding footprint a spectrum is recorded—this means there is a significantly (about 1000×) more data to transfer than what would be required of just an [[RGB color model|RGB]] [[pixel]]. Changes in surface [[albedo]] and viewing angles may affect measurements, and satellites may employ different viewing modes over different locations; these may be accounted for in the algorithms used to convert raw into final measurements. As with other space-based instruments, [[space debris]] must be avoided to prevent damage.

[[Water vapor]] can dilute other gases in air and thus change the amount of {{CO2}} in a column above the surface of the Earth, so often column-average dry-air mole fractions (X&lt;sub&gt;{{CO2}}&lt;/sub&gt;) are reported instead. To calculate this, instruments may also measure O{{sub|2}}, which is diluted similarly to other gases, or the algorithms may account for water and surface pressure from other measurements.&lt;ref name="WunchToon2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Total Carbon Column Observing Network |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences |last1=Wunch |first1=D. |last2=Toon |first2=G.

Because of measurement imperfections and errors in fitting signals to obtain X&lt;sub&gt;{{CO2}}&lt;/sub&gt;, space-based observations may also be compared with ground-based observations such as those from the [[TCCON]].&lt;ref name="Butz2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Toward accurate {{CO2}} and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; observations from GOSAT |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |last1=Butz |first1=A. |last2=Guerlet |first2=S. |last3=Hasekamp |first3=O. |last4=Schepers |first4=D. |last5=Galli |first5=A. |last6=Aben |first6=I. |last7=Frankenberg |first7=C. |last8=Hartmann |first8=J.-M. |last9=Tran |first9=H. |last10=Kuze |first10=A. |last11=Keppel-Aleks |first11=G. |last12=Toon |first12=G. |last13=Wunch |first13=D. |last14=Wennberg |first14=P. |last15=Deutscher |first15=N. |last16=Griffith |first16=D. |last17=Macatangay |first17=R. |last18=Messerschmidt |first18=J. |last19=Notholt |first19=J. |last20=Warneke |first20=T. |display-authors=3 |volume=38 |issue=14 |at=L14812 |date=July 2011 |doi=10.1029/2011GL047888 |bibcode=2011GeoRL..3814812B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Thomas Mount''' (known in Modern Tamil as '''Parangimalai''') is a small [[hillock]] in [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]], near the neighbourhood of [[Guindy]] and very close to [[Chennai International Airport]].

The ancient [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christian]] community of India trace the origin of their [[Saint Thomas Christian churches|church]] to [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas the Apostle]],From the 17th century, this part of Chennai was populated predominantly by [[Anglo-Indian]]s The [[St. Thomas Garrison Church]] is at the foot of St Thomas Mount. St. Thomas Syro Malabar Catholic Church is located east of the shrine at North Silver Street, foot holds of the mountain shrine.

The neighbourhood is served by the [[St. Thomas Mount railway station]], on the southern line of the [[Chennai Suburban Railway Network]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Integration of the [[Chennai Metro|Metro]] and [[Chennai MRTS|MRTS]] with the suburban station in the neighbourhood, is expected to make the suburb the city's largest transit hub after [[Chennai Central]].&lt;ref name="TOI_FromTongaStopToHub"&gt;{{cite news

In the state assembly elections of 1967 and 1971, there was a constituency known as the [[Saint Thomas Mount (State Assembly Constituency)|Saint Thomas Mount]].

== St. Thomas Mount block ==
The [[St. Thomas Mount block]] is a revenue block in the Chennai district of Tamil Nadu, India.
The following cities come under St Thomas Mount Panchayat Union:

*[[Agaramthen]]
*[[Cowl bazaar]]
*[[Mudichur]]
*[[Medavakkam]]
*[[Perumbakkam]]
*[[Nanmangalam]]
*[[Polichalur]]
*[[Trisulam]]
*[[Peerkankaranai]]
*[[Perungalathur]]

== Hill shrine ==
A shrine dedicated to "Our Lady of Expectation" ([[Mother Mary]]) was built in 1523 on top of the mount. The altar of this shrine was built on the spot where St. Thomas' death traditionally believed to have been occurred. At the northern foot of the mount, is a gateway of four impressive arches surmounted by a cross bearing the inscribed date 1547. A flight of 160 steps leads up to the summit of the mount. There are 14 [[stations of the cross]] erected on the way to the summit.

'''Thomas Belt''' (1832 – 21 September 1878), an [[England|English]] [[geologist]] and naturalist, was born at [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]] in 1832, and educated in that city. He is remembered for his work on the geology of gold bearing minerals,  glacial geology, and for his description of the mutualistic relationship between certain bullthorn ''[[Acacia]]'' species and their ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'' ants.

== Early life ==
As a youth Belt became actively interested in [[natural history]] through the [[Tyneside Naturalists Field Club]]. In 1852 he went to [[Australia]] and for about eight years worked at the [[gold]]-diggings, where he acquired a practical knowledge of [[ore]] deposits. In 1860 he proceeded to [[Nova Scotia]] to take charge of some gold-mines, and there met with a serious injury, which led to his return to England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1861 Belt issued a separate work entitled ''Mineral Veins: an Enquiry into their Origin, founded on a Study of the Auriferous Quartz Veins of Australia''. Later on he was engaged for about three years at [[Dolgelly]], another though small gold-mining region, and here he carefully investigated the [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[fossil]]s of the [[Lingula Flags]], his observations being published in an important and now classic memoir in the ''Geological Magazine'' for 1867.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Nicaragua==
In the following year he was appointed to take charge of some mines in [[Nicaragua]], where he passed four active and adventurous years the results being given in his ''The Naturalist in Nicaragua''] (1874), a widely regarded work. In this volume the author expressed his views on the former presence of [[glacier]]s in that country.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In this book, he also first described the mutualistic relationship of certain Acacias and the ant we now know as ''[[Pseudomyrmex spinicola]]''. These are a species of red [[myrmecophyte]]-inhabiting [[neotropical]] [[ant]]s which are found only in [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]]. They live in the thorns of a tropical tree, ''[[Acacia collinsii]]'', feeding on [[Nectar (plant)|nectaries]] along with the protein and [[lipid]]-rich pods produced by the plant for the ants and now known as [[Beltian body|Belsian bodies]] (or Beltian bodies) in honor of Belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Zuchowski, Willow |year=2005 |title=A Guide to the Tropical Plants of Costa Rica |publisher=Distribuidores Zona Tropical, S.A: Miami, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent papers Belt dealt boldly with the phenomena of the glacial period in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and in various parts of the world.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Death and burial==
After many further expeditions to [[Russia]], [[Siberia]] and [[Colorado]], he was traveling to Colorado for a professional engagement when he fell suddenly ill and died in [[Denver]], on 21 September 1878, at the age of 45. He was buried there in the [[Riverside Cemetery (Denver, Colorado)|Riverside Cemetery]] in Denver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Naturalist in Nicaragua|last=Belt|first=Thomas|page=xxii|publisher=Cosimo|year=2005|isbn=1-59605-217-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''turbomolecular pump''' is a type of [[vacuum pump]], superficially similar to a [[turbopump]], used to obtain and maintain high [[vacuum]].&lt;ref name="O'Hanlon2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=John F. O'Hanlon|title=A User's Guide to Vacuum Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aNaUW-q4ygC&amp;pg=PA387|date=4 March 2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-46715-1|pages=385–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kati1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marton, Kati|title=Vacuum Physics and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfLWfAx1ZWQC&amp;pg=PA258|date=18 January 1980|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-085995-8|pages=247–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pumps work on the principle that gas molecules can be given [[momentum]] in a desired direction by repeated collision with a moving solid surface. In a turbomolecular pump, a rapidly spinning [[Mechanical fan|fan]] rotor 'hits' gas molecules from the inlet of the [[pump]] towards the exhaust in order to create or maintain a [[vacuum]].

==Operating principles==
Most turbomolecular pumps employ multiple stages, each consisting of a quickly rotating [[Rotor (turbine)|rotor blade]] and stationary [[stator|stator blade]] pair. The system works like a [[gas compressor|compressor]] that puts energy into the gas, rather than taking it out. Gas captured by the upper stages is pushed into the lower stages and successively compressed to the level of the fore-vacuum (backing pump) pressure.
As the [[gas]] molecules enter through the inlet, the rotor, which has a number of angled blades, hits the molecules. Thus the mechanical energy of the blades is transferred to the gas molecules. With this newly acquired momentum, the gas molecules enter into the gas transfer holes in the stator. This leads them to the next stage where they again collide with the rotor surface, and this process is continued, finally leading them outwards through the exhaust.

Because of the relative motion of rotor and stator, molecules preferentially hit the lower side of the blades. Because the blade surface looks down, most of the scattered molecules will leave it downwards. The surface is rough, so no reflection will occur. A blade needs to be thick and stable for high pressure operation and as thin as possible and slightly bent for maximum compression. For high compression ratios the throat between adjacent rotor blades (as shown in the image) is pointing as much as possible in the forward direction. For high flow rates the blades are at 45° and reach close to the axis.

[[Image:Turbo pump schematic-2011-05-02.gif|thumb|right|250 px|Schematic of a turbomolecular pump.]]

Because the compression of each stage is ~10, each stage closer to the outlet is considerably smaller than the preceding inlet stages. This has two consequences. The geometric progression tells us that infinite stages could ideally fit into a finite axial length. The finite length in this case is the full height of the housing as the [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], the motor, and controller and some of the coolers can be installed inside on the axis. Radially, to grasp as much of the thin gas at the entrance, the inlet-side rotors would ideally have a larger [[radius]], and correspondingly higher centrifugal force; ideal blades would get exponentially thinner towards their tips and carbon fibers should reinforce the aluminium blades. However, because the average speed of a blade affects pumping so much this is done by increasing the root [[diameter]] rather than the tip diameter where practical.

The performance of a turbomolecular pump is strongly related to the frequency of the rotor. As rpm increases, the rotor blades deflect more. To increase speed and reduce the deformation, stiffer materials and different blade designs have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900212002239 |title = Iqbal and Abdul Wasy et. al., NIMA-A, 2012 Design modification in rotor blade of turbo molecular pump | doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.02.030 | volume=678 | journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment | pages=88–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turbomolecular pumps must operate at very high speeds, and the friction heat buildup imposes design limitations. Some turbomolecular pumps use magnetic bearings to reduce [[friction]] and oil contamination. Because the magnetic bearings and the temperature cycles allow for only a limited clearance between rotor and stator, the blades at the high pressure stages are somewhat degenerated into a single helical foil each. Laminar flow cannot be used for pumping, because laminar turbines stall when not used at the designed flow. The pump can be cooled down to improve the compression, but should not be so cold as to condense ice on the blades.
When a turbopump is stopped, the oil from the backing vacuum may backstream through the turbopump and contaminate the chamber. One way to prevent this is to introduce a laminar flow of [[nitrogen]] through the pump. The transition from vacuum to nitrogen and from a running to a still turbopump has to be synchronized precisely to avoid mechanical stress to the pump and overpressure at the exhaust. A thin membrane and a valve at the exhaust should be added to protect the turbopump from excessive back pressure (e.g. after a power failure or leaks in the backing vacuum).

The rotor is stabilized in all of its six [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. One degree is governed by the electric motor. Minimally, this degree must be stabilized electronically (or by a diamagnetic material, which is too unstable to be used in a precision pump bearing). Another way (ignoring losses in [[magnetic cores]] at high frequencies) is to construct this bearing as an axis with a sphere at each end. These spheres are inside hollow static spheres. On the surface of each sphere is a checkerboard pattern of inwards and outwards going magnetic field lines. As the checkerboard [[pattern]] of the static spheres is rotated, the rotor rotates. In this construction no axis is made stable on the cost of making another axis unstable, but all axes are neutral and the electronic regulation is less stressed and will be more dynamically stable. Hall effect sensors can be used to sense the rotational position and the other degrees of freedom can be measured capacitively.

==Maximum pressure==
[[Image:Edwards turbopump.jpg|thumb|left|A turbomolecular pump with attached [[vacuum ionization gauge]] for [[pressure measurement]].]]
At atmospheric pressure, the [[mean free path]] of air is about 70&amp;nbsp;nm. A turbomolecular pump can work only if those molecules hit by the moving blades reach the stationary blades before colliding with other molecules on their way. To achieve that, the gap between moving blades and stationary blades must be close to or less than the mean free path. From a practical construction standpoint, a feasible gap between the blade sets is on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;mm, so a turbopump will stall (no net pumping) if exhausted directly to the atmosphere. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, a turbopump will pump when the exhaust pressure is less than about {{convert|10|Pa|mbar|abbr=on}} where the mean free path is about 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm.

Most turbopumps have a [[Holweck pump]] (or molecular drag pump) as their last stage to increase the maximum backing pressure (exhaust pressure) to about 1–10&amp;nbsp;mbar. Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a [[vacuum pump|regenerative pump]] could be used to back to atmospheric pressure directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called [[roughing pump]]) that produces a pressure low enough for the turbomolecular pump to work efficiently. Typically, this backing pressure is below 0.1&amp;nbsp;mbar and commonly about 0.01&amp;nbsp;mbar. The backing pressure is rarely below 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mbar (mean free path ≈ 70&amp;nbsp;mm) because the flow resistance of the vacuum pipe between the turbopump and the roughing pump becomes significant.

The turbomolecular pump can be a very versatile pump. It can generate many degrees of vacuum from intermediate vacuum (~10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Pa) up to [[ultra high vacuum|ultra-high vacuum]] levels (~10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; Pa).

Multiple turbomolecular pumps in a lab or manufacturing-plant can be connected by tubes to a small backing pump. Automatic valves and [[diffusion pump]] like injection into a large buffer-tube in front of the backing pump prevents any overpressure from one pump to stall another pump.

==Practical considerations==
Laws of [[fluid dynamics]] do not provide good approximations for the behavior of individual, highly separated, non-interacting gas molecules, like those found in [[vacuum|high vacuum]] environments. The maximum compression varies linearly with circumferential rotor speed.  In order to obtain extremely low pressures down to 1 [[pascal (unit)|micropascal]], rotation rates of 20,000 to 90,000 revolutions per minute are often necessary. Unfortunately, the compression ratio varies exponentially with the square root of the molecular weight of the gas.  Thus, heavy molecules are pumped much more efficiently than light [[molecule]]s.  Most gases are heavy enough to be well pumped but it is difficult to pump [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] efficiently.

An additional drawback stems from the high rotor speed of this type of pump: very [[Magnetic bearing|high grade]] [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s are required, which increase the cost.

Because turbomolecular pumps only work in molecular flow conditions, a pure turbomolecular pump will require a very large backing pump to work effectively. Thus, many modern pumps have a molecular drag stage such as a [[Holweck pump|Holweck]] or [[Diffusion pump|Gaede]] mechanism near the exhaust to reduce the size of backing pump required.

Much of recent turbo pump development has been focused on improvement of the effectiveness of the drag stages.   As gas is removed from a pumped space, the lighter gases hydrogen and helium become a larger proportion of the remaining gas load.  In recent years it has been demonstrated that the precise design of the surface geometry of the drag stages can have a marked effect on pumping of these light gases, improving compression ratios by up to two orders of magnitude for given pumping volume.   As a result, it is possible to use much smaller backing pumps than would be required by pure turbomolecular pumps and/or design more compact turbomolecular pumps.

==History==
The turbomolecular pump was invented in 1958 by W. Becker&lt;!-- Wiley's Handbook of Vacuum Technology, p.420 says 1956, but ~shrug ~~~~ --&gt;, based on the older molecular drag pumps developed by [[Wolfgang Gaede]] in 1913, [[Fernand Holweck]] in 1923 and [[Manne Siegbahn]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Robert M.

'''Volcanic rock''' (often shortened to '''volcanics''' in scientific contexts) is a rock formed from [[magma]] erupted from a [[volcano]]. In other words, it differs from other [[igneous rock]] by being of [[Volcano|volcanic]] origin. Like all rock types, the concept of volcanic rock is artificial, and in nature volcanic rocks grade into [[Subvolcanic rock|hypabyssal]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s and constitute an important element of some [[sediment]]s and [[sedimentary rock]]s. For these reasons, in geology, volcanics and shallow hypabyssal rocks are not always treated as distinct. In the context of [[Precambrian]] [[shield (geology)|shield]] geology, the term "volcanic" is often applied to what are strictly [[metavolcanic rock]]s.

Volcanic rocks are among the most common rock types on Earth's surface, particularly in the oceans. On land, they are very common at plate boundaries and in [[flood basalt|flood basalt province]]s. It has been estimated that volcanic rocks cover about 8% of the Earth's current land surface.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/121/5-6/760.abstract | title=Global geologic maps are tectonic speedometers—Rates of rock cycling from area-age frequencies | first1=Bruce H. | last1=Wilkinson | first2=Brandon J. | last2=McElroy | first3=Stephen E. | last3=Kesler | first4=Shanan E. | last4=Peters | first5=Edward D. | last5=Rothman | journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin | year=2008 | volume=121 | pages=760–779 | doi=10.1130/B26457.1 | bibcode=2009GSAB..121..760W | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531075551/http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/121/5-6/760.abstract | archivedate=2016-05-31 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texture===

Volcanic rocks are usually fine-grained or [[aphanitic]] to glass in texture. They often contain [[xenolith|clasts]] of other [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[phenocryst]]s. Phenocrysts are [[crystal]]s that are larger than the [[matrix (geology)|matrix]] and are identifiable with the unaided [[Human eye|eye]]. [[Rhomb porphyry]] is an example with large [[Rhombus|rhomb]] shaped [[phenocrysts]] embedded in a very fine grained matrix.

Volcanic rocks often have a [[vesicular texture]] caused by voids left by  [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatiles]] trapped in the molten [[lava]]. [[Pumice]] is a highly vesicular rock produced in [[Explosive eruption|explosive volcanic eruptions]].

===Chemistry===
Most modern petrologists classify igneous rocks, including volcanic rocks, 
by their chemistry when dealing with their origin. The fact that different mineralogies and textures may be developed from the same initial magmas has led petrologists to rely heavily on chemistry to look at a volcanic rock's origin.

The chemistry of volcanic rocks is dependent on two things: the initial composition of the primary magma and the subsequent differentiation. Differentiation of most volcanic rocks tends to increase the silica ([[Silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) content, mainly by [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|crystal fractionation]].

The initial composition of most volcanic rocks is [[basalt]]ic, albeit small differences in initial compositions may result in multiple differentiation series. The most common of these series are [[Tholeiitic magma series|tholeiitic]], [[calc-alkaline]], and alkaline.

===Mineralogy===
Most volcanic rocks share a number of common [[mineral]]s. Differentiation of volcanic rocks tends to increase the silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) content mainly by [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallization]]. Thus, more evolved volcanic rocks tend to be richer in minerals with a higher amount of silica such as [[phyllosilicate|phyllo]] and [[tectosilicate]]s including the [[feldspar]]s, [[quartz]] [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] and [[muscovite]].  While still dominated by silicates, more primitive volcanic rocks have mineral assemblages with less silica, such as [[olivine]] and the [[pyroxene]]s. [[Bowen's reaction series]] correctly predicts the order of formation of the most common minerals in volcanic rocks.

Occasionally, a magma may pick up crystals that crystallized from another magma; these crystals are called [[xenocryst]]s. [[Diamond]]s found in [[kimberlite]]s are rare but well-known xenocrysts; the kimberlites do not create the diamonds, but pick them up and transport them to the surface of the Earth.

== Naming ==
[[File:Classification extrusive rocks EN.svg|thumb|A naming diagram showing some terminology used for volcanic rocks]]
[[File:Olivine basalt2.jpg|thumb|right|Vesicular olivine basalt from [[La Palma]] (green [[phenocrysts]] are [[olivine]]).]]
[[File:Pumice on 20 dollars.jpg|thumb|right|A {{convert|15|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} piece of [[pumice]] supported by a rolled U.S. $20 bill demonstrates its very low density.]]
Volcanic rocks are named according to both their [[chemical composition]] and texture. [[Basalt]] is a very common volcanic rock with low [[silica]] content. [[Rhyolite]] is a volcanic rock with high silica content. Rhyolite has silica content similar to that of [[granite]] while basalt is compositionally equal to [[gabbro]]. Intermediate volcanic rocks include [[andesite]], [[dacite]], [[trachyte]], and [[latite]].

[[Pyroclastic rock]]s are the product of explosive volcanism. They are often [[felsic]] (high in silica). Pyroclastic rocks are often the result of volcanic debris, such as [[Volcanic ash|ash]], [[Volcanic bomb|bomb]]s and [[tephra]], and other [[volcanic]] [[ejecta]].  Examples of pyroclastic rocks are [[tuff]] and [[ignimbrite]].

Shallow [[intrusion]]s, which possess structure similar to volcanic rather than [[pluton]]ic rocks, are also considered to be volcanic, shading into [[subvolcanic]].

The terms '''lava stone''' and '''lava rock''' are more used by marketers than geologists, who would likely say "volcanic rock" (since [[lava]] is a molten liquid and [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is solid). "Lava stone" may describe anything from a friable [[silicic]] [[pumice]] to solid [[mafic]] flow basalt, and is sometimes used to describe rocks that were never [[lava]], but look as if they were (such as [[sedimentary]] [[Chinese scholar's rocks|limestone with dissolution pitting]]). To convey anything about the physical or chemical properties of the rock, a more specific term should be used; a good supplier will know what sort of volcanic rock they are selling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reddome.com/lava-rock.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816172701/http://reddome.com/lava-rock.html |archivedate=2017-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition of volcanic rocks ==

[[File:Latit - Boxberg, Hocheifel.jpg|thumb|A German example of [[latite]], a type of volcanic rock]]
The sub-family of rocks that form from volcanic lava are called [[igneous volcanic rock]]s (to differentiate them from igneous rocks that form from magma below the surface, called [[igneous plutonic rock]]s).

The lavas of different volcanoes, when cooled and hardened, differ much in their appearance and composition. If a [[rhyolite]] lava-stream cools quickly, it can quickly freeze into a black glassy substance called [[obsidian]]. When filled with bubbles of gas, the same lava may form the spongy appearing [[pumice]]. Allowed to cool slowly, it forms a light-colored, uniformly solid rock called rhyolite.
[[File:Rhyolite 2013.jpg|thumb|A sample of rhyolite]]

[[File:Scoria AmsterdamIsland 2 edit.jpg|thumb|Basaltic [[scoria]] from [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam Island]] in the Indian Ocean]]

The lavas, having cooled rapidly in contact with the air or water, are mostly finely crystalline or have at least fine-grained ground-mass representing that part of the viscous semi-crystalline lava flow that was still liquid at the moment of eruption. At this time they were exposed only to atmospheric pressure, and the steam and other gases, which they contained in great quantity were free to escape; many important modifications arise from this, the most striking being the frequent presence of numerous steam cavities ([[Vesicular texture|vesicular]] structure) often drawn out to elongated shapes subsequently filled up with minerals by infiltration ([[Amygdule|amygdaloidal]] structure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037702730300341X |title=Transient phenomena in vesicular lava flows based on laboratory experiments with analogue materials |journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|doi=10.1016/s0377-0273(03)00341-x  |accessdate=October 27, 2016 |last1=Pinkerton |first1=H. |first2=N. |last2=Bagdassarov |bibcode=2004JVGR..132..115B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lavasteine24.de/ |title=Lava Stones |accessdate=October 27, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lZHoOeeo?url=https://lavasteine24.de/ |archivedate=October 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=5970696 |title=Rheological properties of basaltic lavas at sub-liquidus temperatures: laboratory and field measurements on lavas from Mount Etna |publisher=cat.inist.fr |accessdate=October 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102084409/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=5970696 |archivedate=November 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As crystallization was going on while the mass was still creeping forward under the surface of the Earth, the latest formed minerals (in the [[Matrix (geology)|ground-mass]]) are commonly arranged in subparallel winding lines that follow the direction of movement (fluxion or fluidal structure)—and larger early minerals that previously crystallized may show the same arrangement. Most lavas fall considerably below their original temperatures before emitted. In their behavior, they present a close analogy to hot solutions of salts in water, which, when they approach the saturation temperature, first deposit a crop of large, well-formed crystals (labile stage) and subsequently precipitate clouds of smaller less perfect crystalline particles (metastable stage).

In igneous rocks the first generation of crystals generally forms before the lava has emerged to the surface, that is to say, during the ascent from the subterranean depths to the crater of the volcano. It has frequently been verified by observation that freshly emitted lavas contain large crystals borne along in a molten, liquid mass. The large, well-formed, early crystals ([[phenocryst]]s) are said to be [[porphyritic]]; the smaller crystals of the surrounding matrix or ground-mass belong to the post-effusion stage. More rarely lavas are completely fused at the moment of ejection; they may then cool to form a non-porphyritic, finely crystalline rock, or if more rapidly chilled may in large part be non-crystalline or glassy (vitreous rocks such as obsidian, [[tachylyte]], [[pitchstone]]).

A common feature of glassy rocks is the presence of rounded bodies ([[spherulites]]), consisting of fine divergent fibres radiating from a center; they consist of imperfect crystals of feldspar, mixed with quartz or [[tridymite]]; similar bodies are often produced artificially in glasses that are allowed to cool slowly. Rarely these spherulites are hollow or consist of concentric shells with spaces between ([[lithophysae]]). [[Perlite|Perlitic]] structure, also common in glasses, consists of the presence of concentric rounded cracks owing to contraction on cooling.

[[File:Volcanic rock.jpg|thumb|Volcanic rocks, [[Porto Moniz]], [[Madeira]]]]
The phenocrysts or porphyritic minerals are not only larger than those of the ground-mass; as the matrix was still liquid when they formed they were free to take perfect crystalline shapes, without interference by the pressure of adjacent crystals. They seem to have grown rapidly, as they are often filled with enclosures of glassy or finely crystalline material like that of the ground-mass . Microscopic examination of the phenocrysts often reveals that they have had a complex history. Very frequently they show layers of different composition, indicated by variations in color or other optical properties; thus augite may be green in the center surrounded by various shades of brown; or they may be pale green centrally and darker green with strong [[pleochroism]] ([[aegirine]]) at the periphery.

In the feldspars the center is usually richer in calcium than the surrounding layers, and successive zones may often be noted, each less calcic than those within it. Phenocrysts of quartz (and of other minerals), instead of sharp, perfect crystalline faces, may show rounded corroded surfaces, with the points blunted and irregular tongue-like projections of the matrix into the substance of the crystal. It is clear that after the mineral had crystallized it was partly again dissolved or corroded at some period before the matrix solidified.

Corroded phenocrysts of [[biotite]] and [[hornblende]] are very common in some lavas; they are surrounded by black rims of [[magnetite]] mixed with pale green augite. The hornblende or biotite substance has proved unstable at a certain stage of consolidation, and has been replaced by a paramorph of augite and magnetite, which may partially or completely substitute for the original crystal but still retains its characteristic outlines.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zincite''' is the [[mineral]] form of [[zinc oxide]] ([[Zinc|Zn]][[Oxygen|O]]). Its [[crystal]] form is rare in nature; a notable exception to this is at the [[Franklin Furnace|Franklin]] and [[Sterling Hill Mine]]s in [[New Jersey]], an area also famed for its many [[fluorescent]] minerals. It has a [[hexagon]]al crystal structure and a color that depends on the presence of impurities. The zincite found at the Franklin Furnace is red-colored, mostly due to [[iron]] and [[manganese]] [[Dopant|dopants]], and associated with [[willemite]] and [[franklinite]].

Zincite crystals can be grown artificially, and synthetic zincite crystals are available as a by-product of [[zinc smelting]]. Synthetic crystals can be colorless or can range in color from dark red, orange, or yellow to light green.

Both natural and synthetic zincite crystals are significant for their early use as semiconductor [[crystal detector]]s in the early development of [[crystal radio]]s before the advent of vacuum tubes.  As an early radio detector it was used in conjunction with another mineral, [[galena]], and this device was known as the [[cat's-whisker detector]].
