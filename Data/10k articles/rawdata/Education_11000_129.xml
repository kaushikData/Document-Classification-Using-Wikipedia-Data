'''Agona-Akrofonso''' is a town in the [[Ashanti Region]] of Ghana. The town is an hour's drive from [[Kumasi]], the Ashanti regional capital.

==Background==
Agona-Akrofonso is a town in the [[Sekyere South District]] of the [[Ashanti Region]] of [[Ghana]], [[West Africa]]. Agona-Akrofonso is approximately {{convert|38|km|mi|0}} north-east of the Ashanti Regional capital, [[Kumasi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/geography/kumasi.php Kumasi (Ashanti Region Capital City)]&lt;/ref&gt; off the Kumasi-[[Mampong]] highway. The population of Agona-Akrofonso is estimated to be about 1,600 inhabitants.
The geographic coordinates for Agona-Akrofonso in the Sekyere South District of the Ashanti Regions are latitude 6°55'15.045"N and longitude 1°28'11.9634"W.

==People of Agona-Akrofonso==
The people of Agona-Akrofonso are Ashantis, belonging to the [[Akan people|Akan]] clan of Ghana, although other Akan people are found as far away as the [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivory Coast]], to the west of Ghana. The people of Akrofonso speak the [[Akan language|Twi]] language, although the language of business, commerce and instruction in educational institutions is [[English language|English]], as in all of Ghana.

==History of Agona-Akrofonso==
Agona-Akrofonso is one of only a few places in the old Ashanti Kingdom where [[Okomfo Anokye]], the legendary Chief High Priest and advisor to the King of the Ashanti Nation, visited during the late 17th century, at the height of the Great Wars with the Denkyira people. According to legend, the People of Akrofonso relocated from the original settlement approx. {{convert|37|km|mi|0}} from Kumasi, to the current existing core of the town where there still exist historic buildings needing rehabilitation and preservation. The historic center of Akrofonso was planned in a [[Grid plan|grid fashion]] from the start, as has been documented in other cases from historical literature concerned with town planning and urbanization. Other town planning principles can be observed in Akrofonso, at large, including a waste-water collection system, public places of convenience, school buildings that double as community health centers, and protected lands.  

Since the 1980s, development of Akrofonso has progressed at a faster pace. The housing stock has increased well beyond the historic core, accompanied by an increase in population and urbanization. Efforts to map out the current geographic extent of Akrofonso is needed as part of a desirable town planning effort, for any town of its size and stature. 

The Akrofosohene [[Throne|Stool]] (seat of Chieftaincy of Akrofonso) is rightly one of the significant [https://web.archive.org/web/20110711034925/http://asanteman.freeservers.com/custom.html Akan stools] from the Ekuona clan and family. Reportedly, the patriarch of the Ekuona is Nana Asante Gyima of Adanse and their totem is the Buffalo (Ekuo), symbolising honesty and uprightness.

==Development in Akrofonso==
There are several pending [[infrastructure]], [http://www.ghanahero.com/SDS.html development plans] and projects currently being considered or under construction in Akrofonso, including a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|0}} [[potable water]] tank with a capacity of over {{convert|12,000|USgal|L|-2}}. To travel to Agona-Akrofonso from Kumasi, take the Kumasi-Mampong [[toll road]], going north. At the main intersection at Agona market, near the lorry park, take the road going east to Asamang. The Akrofonso water tower is approximately 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the intersection. The public [[primary school]] is to the right of the water tower tank, and the old historic part of town is to the west.  

There are several public water wells all around Akrofonso that are available to the people for a low fee, per bucket. However, many homes have private water wells, and the same applies to toilets. The water tower is being developed through private enterprise and is expected to be completed before June 2012, giving all residents access to a central water source and a potentially better quality/safer water source.

Agona-Akrofonso also had a soccer club known as  Multi Stars which once played in the third division of the Ghanaian league hierarchy but couldn't advance and collapsed since then. It started with notable players in the name of Ofori Christian, Brother, Kwabena Bresiamah, R.K, and their first coach was Boadi Nyamekye popularly known as Kapitulate.

==Education in Agona-Akrofonso==
The local government runs a [[kindergarten]] in Agona-Akrofonso that is not always fully attended by all eligible children. There are many reasons for poor attendance, including poor health or parents' inability to provide supplies, such as shoes, and the need for children to remain at home to help their parents. In addition, there is a [[primary school|primary]] and [[middle school]] called Junior High School. The school's buildings were built in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waltonhigh.org.uk/akrofonso-d-a&lt;/ref&gt; and have received few upgrades. On graduating from the Junior High School, children typically attend one of the [[secondary school]]s, called senior high schools, in Sekyere South District, although many leave the area entirely to attend school in Kumasi, [[Accra]], or other big cities and towns in Ghana. Highly recognized schools such as Adisadel College, Prempeh College, Opoku-ware School and St. Louis School are a few to mention. Tertiary-level education in the town is also progressive. After senior high school, some of the students proceed to universities, polytechnics, nursing and teacher training colleges across the globe.  Other students may end their educational careers and become farmers, or join an apprentice trades company/group (such as for masons, carpenters, roofers, plumbers, etc.) to learn a trade. 

Early in 2012, citizens and supporters of Akrofonso began developing plans to develop the town, focusing in part on the Junior High School. Some long-delayed school improvements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GhanaHero.com|title=Scereece Dev. Services sponsored developments in Akrofonso|url=http://www.ghanahero.com/Akrofonso.html|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; are now needed to replace the roof, repair load-bearing columns, repair windows, doors, and book shelves, and paint the interior and exterior of the building. In addition, furniture (chairs and tables) is needed. Future phases will address potable water needs, hand-washing stations and a new school fence. 

In 2016, the Chief of Akrofonso, Nana Owusu Achiaw with help from the community renoveted the only Junior high school which has run for the Akrofonso-man ages ago. The renovation mainly catered for the roofs, paint and filling in and around the building which give it a very good look. From the benefits of the District common fund, the District Chief Executive, Mr. Ayakwah has put up a new structure to replace the old JHS  but it's yet to be commissioned.

In other cases, young people who leave Akrofonso travel overseas to countries such as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], etc. Consequently, there is a growing number of native Ghanaian diasporans from Agona-Akrofonso all over the world. Many make frequent financial and other remittances to family members, and often visit. This allows for individuals and their families to maintain crucial contacts, including business and educational relations, and sponsorship of construction projects all over Akrofonso and in the nearby towns ([[Agona]], [[Asamang]], [[Jamasi]], etc.).

==Industrial potential==
Agona-Akrofonso is on the Ghana National Electricity Grid,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/national_energy_grid/ghana/ghananationallectricitygrid.shtml "Ghana National Electricity Grid"], Geni.org.&lt;/ref&gt; and many homes have [[electricity]]. [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cocobod.gh/history.php "Cocoa production in Ghana"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115070217/http://www.cocobod.gh/history.php |date=2012-01-15 }}, cocobod.gh.&lt;/ref&gt; is the primary occupation. However, the production of food commodities ([[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, [[cassava]], [[poultry]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[Taro|cocoyam]]s, [[fruit]]s, etc.) is also important to the local [[economy]]. Starting from 2012, some of the local teenagers also are involved in mining activities across mining centers in the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4698">'''Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards (AIMS)''' was a [[standardized test]] administered by the state of [[Arizona]]. AIMS was a standards-based assessment aligned with the Arizona Academic Content Standards. In November, 2014, the Arizona State Board of Education voted to replace AIMS with a new test called AzMERIT ([[Arizona's Measurement of Educational Readiness to Inform Teaching]].)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2014/11/03/arizona-board-votes-new-test-replace-aims/18419021/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test contents==

The content of AIMS varied by grade level, but it usually featured three [[reading (process)|reading]] and [[mathematics]] sections, as well as a [[writing]] portion, where students were assigned to write an essay based on a prompt given to them. For some grade levels, the test included a [[science]] portion in lieu of a writing section.

==High School Graduation==
To graduate from an Arizona public high school, a student had to meet the AIMS High School Graduation Requirement. The most common way to meet this requirement was to pass the writing, reading, and mathematics content areas of the AIMS HS test. High school students had multiple opportunities to take and pass these content areas. For students who did not pass all three required content areas of the AIMS HS test, there were alternative methods for meeting the AIMS High School Graduation requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/15/00701-01.htm&amp;Title=15&amp;DocType=ARS "Arizona Revised Statutes 15-701.01"]&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement was dropped after the test was replaced by the AzMERIT test.

==AIMS scholarships==

Additionally, starting with the class of 2006, high-school students in Arizona who exceeded all three standards in reading, writing, and math may have been eligible for a scholarship to any of the three public state universities if they also met certain other criteria. Students must have completed all 16 core competency courses (4 units English, 4 units Math, 3 units Lab Science, 2 units Social Science, 2 units Foreign Language, and 1 unit Fine Arts) by graduation with a B or better in each course. Students must have also met at least one of the following academic requirements: A cumulative [[GPA]] of 3.5 or higher on an unweighted 4.0 scale, or rank in the top 5% of their graduating class.

If a student did not exceed standards on all three tests, they may have still qualified for a scholarship if they exceeded standards on two of the AIMS sections and met standards on the other section. Additionally, they would have either needed to receive at least a score of 3 on two [[Advanced Placement]] tests or at least a score of 4 on two [[International Baccalaureate]] exams.

Qualified students would receive a full state university tuition waiver valid for one year following graduation from high school. The scholarship was renewable for four years based upon university-determined criteria. The actual dollar amount of the scholarship varied based upon the tuition charged by the state university in which they enrolled.

On September 23, 2010, the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] voted 9-1 to cut AIMS scholarships to just 25% of freshman year tuition, stating that the scholarship was too easy to earn.&lt;ref&gt;http://azstarnet.com/news/local/education/college/article_c5facfdb-13a0-5f0a-b205-f45f5bfc3307.html&lt;/ref&gt; Students also hade to have an [[ACT (test)|ACT]] score of at least 28 or an [[SAT]]-1 score of at least 1300 (i.e. the reading and mathematics scores must have been at least 1300). The changes in AIMS scholarships applied beginning with the graduating class of 2013.

== Additional facts ==

In 2007, the AIMS Test began to report out [[Lexile]] measures for students in grades 3-8 and 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexile.com/m/uploads/news-updates/3-20-07.pdf "Lexiles Arrive in the Grand Canyon State," MetaMetrics press release, Mar. 20, 2007.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107054246/http://www.lexile.com/m/uploads/news-updates/3-20-07.pdf |date=January 7, 2010 }} Accessed Dec. 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A Lexile measure can be used to match readers with targeted text and monitor growth in reading ability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azed.gov/azreads/Lexile/ "K-12 Literacy: The Lexile Framework for Reading," Arizona Dept. of Education website.] Accessed Dec. 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The College was established in 1959 as the Australian College of Education at a conference held at [[Geelong Grammar School]] at the instigation of the then-headmaster [[James Ralph Darling|James Darling]].&lt;ref name = History&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.austcolled.com.au/about-us/history|year = 2016|accessdate = 29 June 2016|title = Australian College of Educators – History|publisher = www.austcolled.com.au|last = Ryan|first = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was renamed as the Australian College of Educators in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Australian College of Educators Annual Report – 2002|url = http://www.austcolled.com.au/documents/item/44|page = 4|chapter = President's Report|last = Brereton|first = E.|year = 2002|publisher = Australian College of Educators}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Darling was the first National President of the ACE and was [[knight bachelor|knighted]] for his services to education and broadcasting in 1968.  The [[Buntine Oration]], a biennial invited presentation made at the ACE conference and is held alternately with the speech of the outgoing National President, was established in 1960 by the four then-surviving children of [[Walter Murray Buntine]] (1866–1953) in his memory.&lt;ref name = WMB&gt;{{cite book|url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/buntine-walter-murray-5423|chapter = Buntine, Walter Murray (1866-1953)|title = Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher = [[Melbourne University Press]]|accessdate = 17 June 2016|volume = 7|year = 1979|last = French|first = E.

The College has been based in Victoria for most of its existence; it did move to Canberra in 1988, though it has since returned to Melbourne and is presently based at the [[University of Melbourne Graduate School of Education|Melbourne Graduate School of Education]].&lt;ref name = History /&gt;  The first [[Jean Blackburn]] Oration was held their in 2014, given by [[David Gonski]],&lt;ref name = History /&gt; author of the [[Gonski Report]] which was an important election issue in the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013]] and [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal elections]].

Walter Buntine had a significant role in the development of education in Victoria from his position as headmaster of [[Caulfield Grammar School]] (1896–1932)&lt;ref name = ACE_ShortHistory /&gt; and his descendants have continued to be actively involved in education.  His son, [[Arnold Buntine|M.

'''Bjørn Lomborg''' ({{IPA-da|bjɶɐ̯n ˈlʌmbɒːˀw|lang}}; born 6 January 1965) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] author and President of his think tank, [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]]. He is former director of the Danish government's [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] (EAI) in [[Copenhagen]]. He became internationally known for his best-selling and controversial book, ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' (2001), in which he argues that many of the costly measures and actions adopted by scientists and policy makers to meet the challenges of global warming will ultimately have minimal impact on the world's rising temperature.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicyblogs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2013/10/23/a-candid-discussion-with-bjorn-lomborg/|publisher=foreignpolicyblogs.com|title=A Candid Discussion with Bjorn Lomborg - Foreign Policy Blogs &amp;#124; Foreign Policy Blogs|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], a project-based conference where prominent [[economists]] sought to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methods based on the theory of [[welfare economics]].

In 2009, ''[[Business Insider]]'' cited Lomborg as one of "The 10 Most-Respected Global Warming Skeptics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-ten-most-important-climate-change-skeptics-2009-7?op=1 | title=The 10 Most-Respected Global Warming Skeptics | publisher=Business Insider | date=30 July 2009 | accessdate=24 April 2015 | author=Weisenthal, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Lomborg campaigned against the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and other measures to cut carbon emissions in the short-term, he argued for adaptation to short-term temperature rises, and for spending money on research and development for longer-term environmental solutions. His issue is not with the reality of climate change, but rather with the economic and political approaches being taken (or not taken) to meet the challenges of that climate change. He is a strong advocate for focusing attention and resources on what he perceives as far more pressing world problems, such as AIDS, malaria and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/17/comment.climatechange | title=Sucked dry | publisher=The Guardian | date=17 October 2007 | accessdate=24 April 2015 | author=Lomborg, Bjorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704517504574589952331068322 | title=Time for a Smarter Approach to Global Warming | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=15 December 2009 | accessdate=24 April 2015 | author=Lomborg, Bjorn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his critique of the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]], Lomborg stated: "Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/wrongheaded-in-rio | title=Wrongheaded in Rio|year=2012 |work=[[Project Syndicate]] | first1=Bjørn | last1=Lomborg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, and 2012, Lomborg was named a ''Top 100 Global Thinker'' by [[Foreign Policy]] "for looking more right than ever on the politics of climate change".&lt;ref name="ted"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/foreign-policy-releases-its-list-of-the-100-top-global-thinkers-including-17-ted-speakers/|publisher=blog.ted.com|title=Foreign Policy’s 100 Top Global Thinkers includes 17 TED speakers &amp;#124; TED Blog |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Lomborg spent a year as an undergraduate at the [[University of Georgia]], earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in [[political science]] at the [[University of Aarhus]] in 1991, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in political science at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1994.

== Career ==
Lomborg lectured in [[statistics]] in the Department of Political Science at the University of Aarhus as an [[assistant professor]] (1994–1996) and [[associate professor]] (1997–2005). He left the university in February 2005 and in May of that year became an adjunct professor in Policy-making, Scientific Knowledge and the Role of Experts at the Department of Management, Politics and Philosophy, [[Copenhagen Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-management-politics-and-philosophy/events/appointment-of-bjoern-lomborg | title=Appointment of Bjørn Lomborg | publisher=Copenhagen Business School | date=3 June 2005 | accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career, his professional areas of interest lay in the simulation of strategies in [[collective action]] [[Ethical dilemma|dilemmas]], simulation of [[political party|party]] behavior in [[Party-list proportional representation|proportional voting systems]], and the use of surveys in [[public administration]]. In 1996, Lomborg's paper, "Nucleus and Shield: Evolution of Social Structure in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma", was published in the [[academic journal]], ''[[American Sociological Review]]''.&lt;ref name=1996Nucleus&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Lomborg  | first = Bjørn  | authorlink =  | year = 1996  | month =  | title = Nucleus and Shield: The Evolution of Social Structure in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma  | journal = American Sociological Review  | volume = 61  | issue = 2  | pages = 278–307  | doi = 10.2307/2096335  | publisher = American Sociological Review, Vol. 61, No. 2  | jstor = 2096335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Lomborg's interests shifted to the use of statistics in the [[Environmental movement|environmental arena]]. In 1998, Lomborg published four [[essay]]s about the state of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in the leading Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'', which according to him "resulted in a firestorm debate spanning over 400 articles in major metropolitan newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lomborg.com/about/biography/ Bjørn Lomborg Biography], www.lomborg.com. Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the ''Skeptical Environmentalist'', whose English translation was published as a work in [[environmental economics]] by Cambridge University Press in 2001. He later edited ''Global Crises, Global Solutions'', which presented the first conclusions of the Copenhagen Consensus, published in 2004 by the Cambridge University Press. In 2007, he authored a book entitled ''[[Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming]].''

In March 2002, the newly elected [[Centre-right|center-right]] [[prime minister]], [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], appointed Lomborg to run Denmark's new [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] (EAI). On 22 June 2004, Lomborg announced his decision to resign from this post to go back to the University of Aarhus,&lt;ref name=lomborg-error&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fog|first1=Kåre |title=The functioning of the Environmental Assessment Institute |url=http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/lomborgstory15.htm |publisher=www.lomborg-errors.dk |accessdate=25 October 2015 |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying his work at the Institute was done and that he could better serve the public debate from the academic sector.

Lomborg has created several short videos for the educational website [[Prager University]], a US-based conservative think tank founded by talk show host [[Dennis Prager]]. His videos focus on environmental science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prageru.com/courses/environmental-science/paris-climate-agreement-wont-change-climate&lt;/ref&gt;

Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the Copenhagen Consensus in 2002, which seeks to establish priorities for advancing [[world|global]] welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics. A panel of prominent economists was assembled to evaluate and rank a series of problems every four years. The project was funded largely by the Danish government and was co-sponsored by ''[[The Economist]]''. A book summarizing the conclusions of the economists' first assessment, ''[[Global Crises, Global Solutions]]'', edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by [[Cambridge University Press]].

In 2006, Lomborg became director of the newly established [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]], a Danish government-funded institute intended to build on the mandate of the EAI, and expand on the original Copenhagen Consensus conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/our-story | title=Our story | publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center | accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark withdrew its funding in 2012 and the Center faced imminent closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/23/bjorn-lomborg-climate-thinktank-close | title=Bjorn Lomborg's climate sceptic thinktank to close | publisher=''The Guardian'' | date=23 January 2012 | accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-17 Apr 2015" /&gt; Lomborg left the country and reconstituted the Center as a non-profit organization in the United States.&lt;ref name="cosmos"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth-sciences/bj%C3%B8rn-lomborg-resilient-environmentalist | title=Bjørn Lomborg: The resilient environmentalist | publisher=''COSMOS Magazine'' | date=21 October 2013 | accessdate=21 November 2014 | author=Kloor, Keith | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024519/https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth-sciences/bj%C3%B8rn-lomborg-resilient-environmentalist | archive-date=29 November 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/press-contact | title=Press Contact | publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center | accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was based out of a "Neighborhood Parcel Shipping Center" in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], though Lomborg himself was based in [[Prague]] in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="Conversation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/still-no-consensus-for-bjorn-lomborg-the-climate-change-refugee-45423|title=Still no consensus for Bjorn Lomborg, the climate change refugee|last=Holmes|first=David|work=The Conversation|date=30 July 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Lomborg described the Center's funding as "a little more than $1m a year...from private donations",&lt;ref name="Guardian-17 Apr 2015" /&gt; of which Lomborg himself was paid $775,000 in 2012.&lt;ref name="Conversation" /&gt;

In April 2015, it was announced that an alliance between the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the [[University of Western Australia]] would see the establishment of the Australian Consensus Centre, a new policy research center at the UWA Business School. The University described the Center's goals as a "focus on applying an economic lens to proposals to achieve good for Australia, the region and the world, prioritizing those initiatives which produce the most social value per dollar spent.".&lt;ref name="news.uwa.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201504027455/events/new-economic-prioritisation-research-centre-uwa|title=New economic prioritisation research centre at UWA|publisher=University of Western Australia|date=2 April 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appointment came under intense scrutiny, particularly when leaked documents revealed that the Australian government had approached UWA and offered to fund the Consensus Centre, information subsequently confirmed by a senior UWA lecturer.&lt;ref name="SMH-23 Apr 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bjorn-lomborg-centre-leaked-documents-cast-doubt-on-abbott-government-claims-20150423-1mqfnn.html|title=Bjorn Lomborg centre: leaked documents cast doubt on Abbott government claims|last1=Cox|first1=Lisa|last2=Knott|first2=Matthew|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports indicated that Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]]'s office was directly responsible for Lomborg's elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/prime-minister-tony-abbotts-office-the-origin-for-controversial-bjorn-lomborg-centre-decision-20150423-1mrha2.html|title=Prime Minister Tony Abbott's office the origin for controversial Bjorn Lomborg centre decision|last1=Massola|first1=James|last2=Knott|first2=Matthew|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; $4&amp;nbsp;million of the total funding for the Center was to be provided by the Australian federal government,&lt;ref name="Guardian-17 Apr 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/17/abbott-government-gives-4m-to-help-climate-sceptic-set-up-australian-centre|title=Abbott government gives $4m to help climate contrarian set up Australian centre|last=Taylor|first=Lenore|date=16 April 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with UWA not contributing any funding for the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Paul|title=Message from the Vice-Chancellor on the Australian Consensus Centre|url=http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201505087564/message-vice-chancellor-australian-consensus-centre|publisher=University of Western Australia|accessdate=10 May 2015|date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 2015, UWA cancelled the contract for hosting the Australian Consensus Centre as "the proposed centre was untenable and lacked academic support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-09/students-praise-uwa-for-ditching-bjorn-lomborg-think-tank/6457210|title=Students praise UWA for ditching controversial $4m Bjorn Lomborg Consensus Centre think tank|publisher=ABC|date=9 May 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UWA cancels contract for Consensus Centre headed by controversial academic Bjorn Lomborg|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-08/bjorn-lomborg-uwa-consensus-centre-contract-cancelled/6456708|accessdate=10 May 2015|work=ABC News|date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian federal education minister, [[Christopher Pyne]], said that he would find another university to host the ACC.

In July 2015, [[Flinders University]] senior management began quietly canvassing its staff about a plan to host the renamed Lomborg Consensus Centre at the University, likely in the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences. A week later the story was broken on Twitter by the NTEU (National Tertiary Education Union)&lt;ref name="twitter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NTEUWA/status/624107282452754433|publisher=twitter.com|title=NTEU WA Division on Twitter: "@NTEUSA @NTEUNational @NTEUVictoria @NTEUNSW @NTEUQld Do we need a new hashtag #lomborgflinders since we hear he maybe heading there?"|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scott Ludlam.&lt;ref name="twitter2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SenatorLudlam/status/624113257838542848|publisher=twitter.com|title=Scott Ludlam on Twitter: "rumour has it Bjorn Lomborg might be setting up shop at Flinders Uni in SA: anyone able to confirm? #lomborgflinders #findbjorn"|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story appeared the next day in The Australian,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au%2Fhigher-education%2Fflinders-university-in-talks-on-lomborg-plan-for-consensus-centre%2Fstory-e6frgcjx-1227454548253&amp;ei=ozG6VcjWJ8bSmgWw6KvoCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGScfDFWZ9hjaxigevHK4rWVHnApQ&amp;sig2=U5gRecjvhTphXhmr6Zq7Mg&amp;bvm=bv.99028883,d.dGY&lt;/ref&gt; but described as "academic conversations" with no mention of Bjorn Lomborg's involvement and portrayed as a grassroots desire for the Centre by the University.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.flinders.edu.au/flinders-news/2015/07/24/statement-from-the-vice-chancellor-on-current-academic-discussions/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, a story appeared in the Guardian quoting two Flinders University academics and an internal document demonstrating staff's withering rejection of the idea.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/28/bjrn-lomborgs-4m-centre-rejected-by-flinders-university-academics|publisher=theguardian.com|title=Bjørn Lomborg's $4m centre rejected by Flinders University academics &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; The Guardian|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flinders staff and students vowed to fight against the establishment of any Centre or any partnership with Lomborg,&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/students-and-staff-warn-of-angry-backlash-if-sceptical-environmentalist-bjorn-lomborg-sets-up-research-centre-at-flinders-university-20150724-gijmlz.html|publisher=smh.com.au|title=Students and staff warn of angry backlash if 'sceptical environmentalist' Bjorn Lomborg sets up research centre at Flinders University|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing his lack of scientific credibility, his lack of academic legitimacy and the political nature of the process of establishing the Centre with the Abbott federal government. The [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]] and [[350.org]] launched a national campaign to support staff and students in their rejection of Lomborg.&lt;ref name="aycc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aycc.org.au/bjorn_free|publisher=aycc.org.au|title=Open Letter to Flinders Uni - Keep Us Bjorn-Free - AYCC|accessdate=12 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229101704/http://www.aycc.org.au/bjorn_free|archive-date=29 February 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 2015, education minister [[Simon Birmingham]] told a senate committee the offered funding had been withdrawn.&lt;ref name=aaas-no-funds&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dayton|first1=Leigh|title=Climate-change contrarian loses Australian funding|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/10/climate-change-doubter-loses-australian-funding|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|accessdate=25 October 2015|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently unclear whether the Australian Government would honour its original commitment and transfer the funds directly to the Centre to cover the costs incurred, in particular given Lomborg's unique expertise and contribution.

Several of Bjørn Lomborg's articles in newspapers such as [[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] have been checked by Climate Feedback, a worldwide network of scientists who collectively assess the credibility of influential climate change media coverage. The Climate Feedback reviewers assessed that the scientific credibility ranged between "low" and "very low". The Climate Feedback reviewers come to the conclusion that in one case Lomborg "practices cherry-picking",&lt;ref&gt;https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-bjorn-lomborg-alarming-thing-climate-alarmism/&lt;/ref&gt; in a second case he "had reached his conclusions through cherry-picking from a small subset of the evidence, misrepresenting the results of existing studies, and relying on flawed reasoning",&lt;ref&gt;https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/bjorn-lomborg-overheated-climate-alarm-wall-street-journal/&lt;/ref&gt; in a third case "[his] article [is in] blatant disagreement with available scientific evidence, while the author does not offer adequate evidence to support his statements",&lt;ref&gt;https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-telegraph-bjorn-lomborg-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-good-thing/&lt;/ref&gt; and, in a fourth case, "The author, Bjorn Lomborg, cherry-picks this specific piece of research and uses it in support of a broad argument against the value of climate policy. He also misrepresents the Paris Agreement to downplay its potential to curb future climate change."&lt;ref&gt;https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/sea-level-rise-those-non-disappearing-pacific-islands-bjorn-lomborg-wall-street-journal/&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' ==
{{main|The Skeptical Environmentalist}}
In 2001, he attained significant attention by publishing ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', a controversial book whose main thesis is that many of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues are wrong.

In the chapter on climate change in ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', he states: "This chapter accepts the reality of man-made global warming but questions the way in which future scenarios have been arrived at and finds that forecasts of climate change of 6 degrees by the end of the century are not plausible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|authorlink=Bjørn Lomborg|title=The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JuLko8USApwC|year=2001|page=259|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0521010683}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cost–benefit analyses]], calculated by the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], ranked climate mitigation initiatives lowest on a list of international development initiatives when first done in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/2004copenhagen_consensus_result_final.pdf | title=Copenhagen Consensus: The Results | publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center | accessdate=21 November 2014}} "Optimal carbon tax," "The Kyoto Protocol," and "Value-at-risk carbon tax" ranked 15, 16, and 17 on a ranked list of 17 evaluated projects, with a collective Project Rating of Bad.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview with the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Lomborg summarized his position on climate change: "Global warming is real – it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elmhirst|first=Sophie|date=24 September 2010|title=The NS Interview: Bjørn Lomborg|journal=New Statesman|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2010/09/interview-gay-climate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal accusations of scientific dishonesty ===
After the publication of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', Lomborg was formally accused of scientific dishonesty by a group of environmental scientists, who brought a total of three complaints against him to the [[Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty]] (DCSD), a body under Denmark's [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]] (MSTI). Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a "debate" publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed.&lt;ref name="icg2008"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cprm.gov.br/33IGC/1343527.html | title=The 'Lomborg case' on sustainable development and scientific dishonesty | publisher=International Geological Congress | date=2008 | accessdate=23 November 2014 | author=Hansen, Jens Morten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges claimed that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.

In January 2003, the DCSD released a ruling that sent a mixed message, finding the book to be scientifically dishonest through misrepresentation of scientific facts, but Lomborg himself not guilty due to his lack of expertise in the fields in question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fivu.dk/en/publications/2004/annual-report-2003-the-danish-committees-on-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2003 Annual Report]. Retrieved 13 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; That February, Lomborg filed a complaint against the decision with the MSTI, which had oversight over the DCSD. In December, 2003, the Ministry annulled the DCSD decision, citing procedural errors, including lack of documentation of errors in the book, and asked the DCSD to re-examine the case. In March 2004, the DCSD formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.&lt;ref name=icg2008 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3340305.stm | title = Lomborg celebrates ministry ruling | authorlink = | work = | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 22 December 2003 | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Response of the academic community ====
The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a [[petition]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030117223212/http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm "Underskriftsindsamling i protest mod afgørelsen om Bjørn Lomborg fra - Udvalgene Vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed"]. Retrieved 28 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; signed by 287 Danish academics, primarily social scientists, who criticised the DCSD for evaluating the book as a work of science, whereas the petitioners considered it clearly an opinion piece by a non-scientist.&lt;ref name=disbandDCSD&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6924/full/421681b.html | title = Social scientists call for abolition of dishonesty committee | author = Alison Abbott| work = | publisher = Nature | date = 13 February 2003| doi = 10.1038/421681b| accessdate = 28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE50446/kun-faa-ingenioerer-stoetter-lomborg/ | title = Kun få ingeniører støtter Lomborg (Few engineers support Lomborg) | author = Jesper Tornbjerg, Morten Jastrup and Marcus Rubin | work = | publisher = Danmark | date = 17 January 2003 | doi = | accessdate = 28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency (DRA) to form an independent working group to review DCSD practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fi.dk/site/english/publications/2003/annual-report-2002-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2002 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071025142432/http://fi.dk/site/english/publications/2003/annual-report-2002-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty |date=25 October 2007 }}. Retrieved 13 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures, primarily from the medical and [[natural science]]s community, to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the DRA.&lt;ref name=disbandDCSD/&gt;

=== Recognition ===
The alumni network of the [[Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership]] (CPSL) voted ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' among its list of the top 50 sustainability books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Visser |first1= Wayne |title=The Top 50 Sustainability Books |year= 2009 |publisher= Greenleaf Publishing |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-1-906093-32-7|pages=256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued debate and criticism ===
The rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003–2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.

''The Lomborg Deception'', a book by [[Howard Friel]], claims to offer a "careful analysis" of the ways in which Lomborg has "selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence",&lt;ref name=pk&gt;Philip Kitcher.

February 26, 2010. |publisher=Yale Press|accessdate=13 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he admits two errors, but otherwise in general rejects Lomborg's arguments.

A group of scientists, Arthur Rörsch, Thomas Frello, Ray Soper and Adriaan De Lange published an article in 2005 in the ''[[Journal of Information Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250207154_On_the_Opposition_Against_the_Book_The_Skeptical_Environmentalist_by_B_Lomborg&lt;/ref&gt; in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused their authority to suppress Lomborg.

The claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of ''Journal of Information Ethics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fog, K. |title=The real nature of the opposition against B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=66–76 |date=Fall 2005 |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.2.66}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Kåre Fog, one of the original plaintiffs. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called "the [[Galileo affair|Galileo]] hypothesis", which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition. Fog and other scientists have continued to criticize Lomborg for what one called "a history of misrepresenting" climate science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2015 |author=Fog, K. |title=Lomborg Errors |url=http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/ |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2015 |author=Rahmstorf, Stefan |title=Bjørn Lomborg, just a scientist with a different opinion? |url= http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=18727 |publisher=RealClimate.org |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the government of Australia offered the University of Western Australia $4&amp;nbsp;million to establish a "consensus centre" with Lomborg as director. The university accepted the offer, setting off a firestorm of opposition from its faculty and students and from climate scientists around the world. In April 2015 the university reversed the decision and rejected the offer. The government continued to seek a sponsor for the proposed institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=4 June 2015  |author=Knott, M. |title=Bjorn Lomborg saga: Senate estimates hears 'consensus centre' could still come to Australia |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bjorn-lomborg-saga-senate-estimates-hears-consensus-centre-could-still-come-to-australia-20150604-ghgd75.html |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October 2015 the offered funding was withdrawn.&lt;ref name=aaas-no-funds/&gt; (For further details see the "Copenhagen Consensus" sub-section of the "[[#Copenhagen Consensus|Career]]" section, above.)

Lomborg's approach evolved in directions more compatible with action to restrain climate change. In April 2015 he gained further attention when he issued a call for all subsidies to be removed from fossil fuels on the basis that "a disproportionate share of the subsidies goes to the middle class and the rich"...making fossil fuel so "inexpensive that consumption increases, thus exacerbating global warming".&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/its-time-to-stop-subsidizing-fossil-fuels/article24002168/|publisher=theglobeandmail.com|title=It’s time to stop subsidizing fossil fuels - The Globe and Mail|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In publications such as the ''Wall Street Journal'' he argued that the most productive use of resources would be a massive increase in funding for research to make renewable energy economically competitive with fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lomborg|first1=Bjorn|title=The Charade of the Paris Treaty|work=The Wall Street Journal Review|date=June 17–18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussions in the media ==
After the release of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the [[News media|media]], where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international [[mass media]]. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and [[Publishing|print media]] around the world. He is also a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2005.
* ''[[Scientific American]]'' published strong criticism of Lomborg's book. Lomborg responded on his own [[website]], quoting the article at such length that ''Scientific American'' threatened to sue for [[copyright infringement]]. Lomborg eventually removed the rebuttal from his website; it was later published in [[PDF]] format on ''Scientific American'''s site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF "Bjørn Lomborg’s comments to the 11-page critique in January 2002 Scientific American (SA)"].

* ''[[The Economist]]'' defended Lomborg, claiming the panel of experts that had criticised Lomborg in ''Scientific American'' was both biased and did not actually counter Lomborg's book. ''The Economist'' argued that the panel's opinion had come under no scrutiny at all, and that Lomborg's responses had not been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1522706 "Thought control"].

* The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] strongly criticised ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', claiming it to be "seriously flawed and failing to meet basic standards of credible scientific analysis", accusing Lomborg of presenting data in a fraudulent way, using flawed logic and selectively citing non-peer-reviewed literature.&lt;ref name="UCS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/fight-misinformation/ucs-examines-the-skeptical.html#.VTzjWfdApSA|title=UCS Examines 'The Skeptical Environmentalist' |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was conducted by [[Peter Gleick]], [[Jerry D.

Bjørn Lomborg released a documentary feature film, ''Cool It'', on 12 November 2010 in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69B2MK20101012 "Cool It" movie seeks climate solutions: Lomborg], Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.empiremovies.com/2010/09/10/tiff-movie-review-cool-it/&lt;/ref&gt;  The film in part explicitly challenged [[Al Gore]]'s 2006 Oscar-winning environmental awareness documentary, ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', and was frequently presented by the media in that light, as in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' headline, "Controversial ‘Cool It’ Documentary Takes on 'An Inconvenient Truth'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/11/10/controversial-cool-it-documentary-takes-on-an-inconvenient-truth/ | title=Controversial ‘Cool It’ Documentary Takes on ‘An Inconvenient Truth’ | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=10 November 2010 | accessdate=21 November 2014 | author=Kaufman, Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/23/movies/23cool.html?_r=0 | title=Filmmaker Seeks to Temper the Message of ‘An Inconvenient Truth’ | publisher=New York Times | date=22 January 2010 | accessdate=21 November 2014 | author=Cieply, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received a media critic collective rating of 51% from [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cool_it/ | title=Cool It (2010) | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 61% from [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cool-it | title=Cool It | publisher=Metacritic | accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]'' review described it as "An urgent, intelligent, and entertaining account of the climate policy debate, with a strong focus on cost-effective solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Crook | first = Clive | authorlink = Clive Crook | title = Bjorn Lomborg's Movie: Is Quiet the New Loud? | publisher = The Atlantic | date = 6 October 2010 | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/10/bjorn-lomborgs-movie-is-quiet-the-new-loud/64186/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Code Hero''''' is a planned [[Educational game|educational]] [[video game]] by Primer Labs, designed by Alex Peake. The game is supposed to teach players how to write [[Source code|programming languages]] by having them do so in a 3D world.

The game drew controversy following its [[Kickstarter]] campaign, when the studio ran out of funds, missed release deadlines and funding rewards, and communicated little with the community. Some financial backers threatened legal action following long periods of no communication. 

The Code Hero website was offline for an extended period in 2014, and Peake has not commented publicly about the state of this project since 2013.  From May 2015 the website was again inactive, however it resurfaced in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Code Hero August Update |date=August 22, 2016 |url=https://codeherogame.wordpress.com/2016/08/22/code-hero-august-update/ |accessdate= 4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The main aim of ''Code Hero'' is to teach players how to write [[Source code|programming languages]] in an engaging way. Players use a gun which can copy code and place it in other areas of the level in order to create a full program in a language such as [[JavaScript]] and [[Unity (game engine)|UnityScript]] whilst moving around a 3D world from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/03/01/code-hero-hiding-a-text-book-in-a-video-game |title= Code Hero: Hiding a Text Book in a Video Game |date= 1 March 2012 |accessdate= 22 December 2013 |first= Anthony |last= Gallegos |work= [[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/code-hero-raises-over-100000-for-shooter-that-teaches-computer-programming/ |title= Code Hero raises over $100,000 for shooter that teaches computer programming |date= 23 February 2012 |accessdate= 22 December 2013 |first= Kyle |last= Orland |work= [[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players start in a world called ''Gamebridge Unityversity's API'' from which they can choose a series of levels which teach basics of the programming languages; after this they move to the ''Humantheon'', from which the player moves on to the rest of the game world, led by a robotic [[Ada Lovelace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/40418/Code_Hero_teaches_programming_through_gaming.php |title= Code Hero teaches programming through gaming |date= 22 February 2012 |accessdate= 22 December 2013 |first= Mike |last= Rose |work= Gamasutra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/02/22/code-hero-teaches-you-how-to-make-games |title= Code Hero 'Teaches You How to Make Games' |date= 21 February 2012 |accessdate= 22 December 2013 |first= Andrew |last= Goldfarb |work= IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

Development on ''Code Hero'' began in January 2011, and in 2012 Peake started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to raise $100,000 USD to fund further development of the game over the next six months. The Kickstarter concluded in February having raised $170,000 USD, at which point $30,000 USD had been raised through their website alongside this.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2012/12/18/3781782/code-hero-kickstarter-interview |title= Code Hero: The Kickstarter success story that soured |date= 18 December 2012 |accessdate= 21 December 2013 |first= Tracey |last= Lien |work= Polygon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.joystiq.com/2013/08/15/code-hero-one-year-later-money-lawsuits-and-poker/ |title= Code Hero, one year later: Money, lawsuits and poker |date= 15 August 2013 |accessdate= 21 December 2013 |first= Jessica |last= Conditt |work= [[Joystiq]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peake hired a development team, and in March 2012, they began working in space provided by [[IGN]] Indie Open House in San Francisco.  The project experienced staff turnover, and by October 2012, ran out of money.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

After failing to deliver the backing rewards by the original date, and not updating the website or [[Twitter]] accounts for months at a time, backers began to demand refunds and became concerned that the project was not sufficiently funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/121069-Code-Hero-Kickstarter-Goes-Bad-UPDATED |title= Code Hero Kickstarter Goes Bad - UPDATED |date= 13 December 2012 |accessdate= 21 December 2013 |first= Andy |last= Chalk |work= Escapist Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original release date of August 31, 2012, at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX]] Prime, was missed, with an update a few days later saying it would be released within days, a date which was also missed.&lt;ref name="dangers"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.joystiq.com/2012/12/13/code-hero-the-dangers-of-a-kickstarter-success-story/ |title= Code Hero: The dangers of a Kickstarter success story |date= 13 December 2012 |accessdate= 21 December 2013 |first= Jessica |last= Conditt |work= Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; When supporter Dustin Deckard began organising to seek legal action after another stretch of no communication, Alex Peake released a statement saying that the game was still being worked on and that Primer Labs was “committed to finishing this game.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/12/14/code-hero-dev-responds-to-kickstarter-complaints |title= Code Hero Dev Responds to Kickstarter Complaints |date= 13 December 2012 |accessdate= 21 December 2013 |first= Andrew |last= Goldfarb |work= [[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raised funds covered the costs of development until October 2012, after which many of the game's developers became volunteers.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dangers"/&gt; Two alpha builds of ''Code Hero'' were released during 2012 for those who had pre-ordered the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2013/2/5/3953320/code-hero-developer-promises-rewards-and-refunds-when-the-project-has |title= Code Hero developer promises rewards and refunds when the project has money |date= 5 February 2013 |accessdate= 21 December 2013 |first= Tracey |last= Lien |work= [[Polygon (magazine)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013 a beta version of the game became available for download on Primer Labs website after being down for a period of weeks.&lt;ref name="summary"/&gt; An announcement dated April 22, 2014 indicated that version 0.5 was forthcoming.  However, the Primer Labs website again went down later in 2014.  The company's Facebook and Twitter accounts have been inactive since 2012.

On November 6, 2015, Primer Labs  website re-opened and was being updated, with weekly updates posted during December. The next planned version (0.5) was set for December 1, 2015, but was never made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A new architectural style |date=January 4, 2015 |accessdate=2015-01-06 |url=http://primerlabs.com |publisher=Primerlabs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was updated in 2017.

'''Contextual learning''' is based on a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] theory of teaching and learning.&lt;ref name=Hull&gt;{{cite book|last=Hull|first=D|title=Opening Minds, Opening Doors: The Rebirth of American Education|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}} Learning takes place when teachers are able to present information in a way that students are able to construct meaning based on their own experiences. Contextual learning experiences include [[intern]]ships, [[service learning]], and [[study abroad]] programs, among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nsee.org&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}

Contextual learning has the following characteristics:
* emphasizing problem solving
* recognizing that teaching and learning need to occur in multiple contexts
* assisting students in learning how to monitor their learning and thereby become self-regulated learners
* anchoring teaching in the diverse life context of students{{clarify|date=April 2013}}
* encouraging students to learn from each other
* employing authentic assessment{{clarify|date=April 2013}}

==Key elements==
Current perspectives on what it means for learning to be contextualized include
* situated cognition – all learning is applied knowledge
* social cognition – intrapersonal constructs
* distributed cognition – constructs that are continually shaped by other people and things outside the individual

Constructivist learning theory maintains that learning is a process of constructing meaning from experience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Imel|first=S|title=Contextual learning in adult education|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED448304.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; {{cn-span|text=Contextual learning may be useful for child development if it provides learning experiences in a context in which children are interested and motivated. Various experiential learning theorists have contributed to an understanding of contextual learning.|date=April 2013}}

==Benefits==
{{POV-section|date=April 2013}}
* Both direct instruction and constructivist activities can be compatible and effective in the achievement of learning goals.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref name=resnick&gt;{{cite book|last=Resnick &amp; Hall|title=Learning organizations for sustainable education reform|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}
* Increasing one’s efforts results in more ability. This theory opposes the notion that one’s aptitude is unchangeable. Striving for learning goals motivates an individual to be engaged in activities with a commitment to learning.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref name=resnick /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}
* Children learn the standards values, and knowledge of society by raising questions and accepting challenges to find solutions that are not immediately apparent. Other learning processes are explaining concepts, justifying their reasoning and seeking information. Therefore, learning is a social process which requires social and cultural factors to be considered during instructional planning. This social nature of learning also drives the determination of the learning goals.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref name=borko&gt;{{cite book|last=Borko &amp; Putnam|title=The role of context in teacher learning and teacher education|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}
* Knowledge and learning are situated in particular physical and social context. A range of settings may be used such as the home, the community, and the workplace, depending on the purpose of instruction and the intended learning goals.&lt;ref name = borko /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}
* Knowledge may be viewed as distributed or stretched over&lt;ref name=lave&gt;{{cite book|last=Lave|first=J|title=Cognition in practice: Mind, mathematics and culture in everyday life|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}} the individual, other persons, and various artifacts such as physical and symbolic tools&lt;ref name=salomon&gt;{{cite book|last=Salomon|first=G|title=Distributed cognitions|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{page needed|date=April 2013}} and not solely as a property of individuals. Thus, people, as an integral part of the learning process, must share knowledge and tasks.&lt;ref name = borko /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}

== Assessment ==
One of the main goals of contextual learning is to develop an authentic task to assess performance.   Creating an assessment in a context can help to guide the teacher to replicate a real world experiences and make necessary inclusive design decisions.  Contextual learning can be used as a form of formative assessment and can help give educators a stronger profile on how the intended learning goals, standards and benchmarks fit the curriculum.  It is essential to establish and align the intended learning goals of the contextual task at the beginning to create a shared understanding of what success looks like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiggins|first1=Grant|last2=McTighe|first2=Jay|title=Understanding love by Design: Professional Development Workbook|date=2004|publisher=Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development|location=Alexandria, VA|isbn=0-87120-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Self-determination_theory|Self-directed theory]] states that humans by nature seek purpose and the desire to make a contribution and to be part of a cause greater and more enduring then oneself.  Contextual learning can help bring relevance and meaning to the learning, helping students relate to the world they live in. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pink|first1=Daniel|title=[[Drive:  The surprising truth about what motivates us]]|date=2009|publisher=Riverhead Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1594488849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions to address when defining and developing a contextual task ==
* Does the task fulfill the intended learning goals?
* Does the task involve problems that require the students to use their knowledge creatively to find a solution?
* Is the task an engaging learning experience?
* Is the audience as authentic as possible?
* Does the task require students to use processes, products and procedures that simulate those used by people working in a similar field?  
* Is the task inclusive?
* Are there clear criteria for students on how the product, performance or service will be evaluated?
* Are there models of excellence which demonstrate standards?
* Are the students involved in the assessment process?
* Is there a provision made for continuous formative feedback, from oneself, from teachers and peers to help the students improve?
* Is there an opportunity for student choice and ownership to the extent that would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiggins|first1=Grant|last2=McTighe|first2=Jay|title=Understanding by Design: Professional Development Workbook|date=2004|publisher=Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development|location=Alexandria, VA|isbn=0-87120-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12166">[[File:Disney College Program logo.svg|right|250px|Disney Theme Parks &amp; Resorts College Program Logo]]
The '''Disney College Program''' is a [[United States|U.S.]] national [[internship]] program operated by [[The Walt Disney Company]], located at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] and the [[Disneyland Resort]]. The Disney College Program recruits students (18 years and older) and all majors for a semester-long paid internship program working at the Walt Disney World Resort or Disneyland Resort.

==History==
The first Disney College Program began in 1981. In the early days, the College Program consisted of just over 200 students from 20 schools working in only one theme park, the [[Magic Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=dailynebraskan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/1.1017249-1.1017249|title=Opportunities await Disney College Program participants|first=Amy|last=Nichols|date=2001-10-30|publisher=dailynebraskan.com|accessdate=2009-03-06}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time it was known as '''The Magic Kingdom College Program (MKCP)'''. In October 1982, program participants could work at Epcot as well as the Magic Kingdom and the program was known as '''The Walt Disney World College Program''',&lt;ref name=cpbrochure&gt;{{Cite book|title=Walt Disney World College Program|year=1983|format=brochure|publisher=Walt Disney Productions|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; employing approximately 500 college students each spring, summer and fall session. From the beginning of the program until 1988, almost all program participants stayed in an off-property [[trailer park|mobile home park]] called '''Snow White Village Campground''' (the remainder in Lake Vista Village apartments) in nearby [[Kissimmee, Florida]]. 1987 saw the opening of Vista Way apartments, which were much closer to the participants' employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MKCP 10 Year Anniversary Newsletter: Summer of '87|first=Glenn|last=Mobley|publisher=Glenn Mobley and Robin Quick-Brantley|date=1998-04-27|page=3|accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the resort's massive growth in the 1990s and the widespread popularity of the internet, the College Program has grown substantially, seeing three new participant housing complexes built and many more colleges represented.  As of 2005, 8,000 students have participated each year, representing at least 301 colleges and universities&lt;ref name=dailynebraskan/&gt;&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8464524/|title=Disney internships draw students, criticism|date=2005-07-05|author=Associated Press|publisher=msnbc.msn.com|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average of 4,000 students at any given time.&lt;ref name=ofmouseandman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/features/story.asp?id=12053|title=Of Mouse and Man|first=Jeffrey|last=Billman|date=2007-12-27|publisher=orlandoweekly.com|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Autumn of 2004, student opportunities at [[Disneyland]] were combined with the opportunities available at Walt Disney World. The program was renamed to the '''Disney Theme Parks and Resorts College Program'''. Currently, the program is being promoted as, simply, the '''Disney College Program'''.

==Application process==
There are specific requirements a student must meet before applying for the Disney College Program. All students must be of 18 years or older before the expected day of arrival. Students must be enrolled in an accredited university or college as a full-time or part-time student, and actively taking classes. Students may also participate in the semester immediately following graduation. Students must complete at least one semester of university or college before entering the Disney College Program, but can apply during their first semester for participation in the program during their second semester. In the case of schools with additional requirement criteria, a student must meet all of those eligibilities before being considered by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cp.disneycareers.com/en/about-disney-college-program/overview/|title=Disney Application Requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who apply to the program are given the option of one of several program seasons throughout the year, each usually lasting between five and seven months, though the culinary session length is dependent upon the student's school schedule.

After the general application is filed, students may be selected to participate in a web-based interview. This can happen immediately or months later.  Students who are selected to proceed beyond the web-based interview then go through a second round over the phone. Here the students clarify with recruiters which of the roles they would be receptive to while attending the program. Some of these roles (or positions) are food and beverage, attractions, custodial, hospitality, merchandise, and entertainment. If a student chooses to apply for an entertainment role, he or she must attend one of several regional auditions. At one point, there was a required viewing of a presentation, however, as of the Fall 2013 application period that is no longer a requirement.

Final notification of the applicant's status (accepted, pending, or no longer in consideration) is usually sent out about 3 weeks after the phone interview, but it can take several months.

==Program information==
At the beginning of the program in the early 1980s, three "experiences" were emphasized: "The Learning Experience", which involved participation in Disney's "Leisure Time Business Management Studies", "The Work Experience" which included work in 4 major areas of the resort, and "The Recreational Experience" which emphasized recreational activities and Disney-sponsored events.&lt;ref name=cpbrochure/&gt; Since that time, the experiences have changed slightly to "living", "learning" and "earning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdwcollegeprogram.com/sap/its/mimes/zh_wdwcp/educators/program_info/cp_overview.html|title=Disney College Program Overview|publisher=''[[Disney]]''|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Living" experience is similar to the original program's "Recreational" experience. Once the student has accepted their position with Disney, they can stay in one of four company sponsored housing units near Walt Disney World Resort during the duration of the program: Vista Way, Chatham Square, Patterson Court, and The Commons (which houses mainly international Cast Members). At the Disneyland Resort, participants stay in the Carnegie Plaza building approximately two miles north of the resort. Each participant can choose to live in a one, two, three, or four bedroom apartment with two to three people per bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneycareers/disneycollegeprogram/dlr/students/housing/housing_overview.html|title=Working:A Unique Working Experience|publisher="[[Disney]]"|accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these options, the Disneyland housing offers a limited number of studio-style apartments.

The cost of housing is deducted automatically from the student’s weekly salary. The cost of housing varies depending on the housing location. There are fees the student must pay upfront upon acceptance into the program based on housing, and these too vary between locations. In Florida there is a nonrefundable program assessment fee of $100 as well as a housing and administration fee for $200, which covers 2 weeks' rent. In California the program assessment fee is $100, with a refundable security deposit of $200 as well as $560 in housing and assessment fees which covers 4 weeks' rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cp.disneycareers.com/en/program-components/living/fees/|title=Disney College Program Fees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are expected to follow certain guidelines in the housing complexes. Roommates are assigned by gender and age, except in the case of a married couple. If a student is under the age of 21 they automatically are placed in a “Wellness Apartment”, or one that is deemed alcohol-free.  For students located in Florida, the Disney Company provides transportation to and from the theme parks. Transportation is not provided for students located in California. Those students are encouraged to bring their own cars. They are also given free bus passes for the [[OCTA]] public transportation system, and earn $1 each day the pass is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cp.disneycareers.com/en/program-components/living/policies/|title=Living Policies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Learning" experience began in the early 80s as a group of 9 seminars on the "philosophies and operating practices" of the various sections of their resort's business.&lt;ref name=cpbrochure/&gt; It has grown to include 8 different courses, each focusing on a Disney topic, rather than a business area. The  Students are required to do textbook readings, write term papers and participate on projects. Additionally, there are now Disney Exploration Series courses, which are more focused on business areas as they relate to Disney. Participants, just like every Cast Member, attend Traditions, which is a 4 hour long orientation that demonstrates everything about the Resort of employment and the company in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdwcollegeprogram.com/sap/its/mimes/zh_wdwcp/educators/program_info/education/education_overview.html|title=Education Overview|publisher=''[[Disney]]''|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Disney Look is required for attendance at Traditions, which is the participants' first official day of work. The program also offers "job shadowing" for participants on days they are not working - the participant can follow Disney Cast Members whose careers are in fields similar to the student's major.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dakotastudent.com/media/storage/paper970/news/2008/09/30/News/Disney.College.Program.Offers.Students.dynamic.Opportunities-3458260.shtml|title=Disney College Program offers students 'dynamic' opportunities|first=Brandi|last=Jewett|date=2008-09-30|publisher=dakotastudent.com|accessdate=2009-03-05}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; Most of the courses are approved by the American Council on Education and offer participants the possibility to earn college credit during their program, subject to a decision by the participant's college or university.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneycareers/disneycollegeprogram/dlr/students/education/edu_overview.html|title=Education|publisher="[[Disney]]"|accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classes approved meet once a week, for most of the program (with breaks during peak seasons) and are four hours long.

The "Earning" experience consists of students working within their resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdwcollegeprogram.com/sap/its/mimes/zh_wdwcp/educators/program_info/working/work_overview.html|title=Working: Real World Experience|publisher=''[[Disney]]''|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the program's inception, students are expected to work in one of 4 "major operating areas": Food, Merchandise, Attractions, and Custodial.&lt;ref name=cpbrochure/&gt; Currently, Disney College Program students work in more than 20 different roles.

Depending on the requirements of a student's school, internship credit may be earned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realvacationscheap.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/disney-college-program/|title=Disney College Program|date=2009-03-02|publisher=realvacationscheap.wordpress.com|accessdate=2009-03-05}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EPIK''' (''English Program in Korea'') is a program to improve the [[English language|English speaking]] abilities of students and teachers in [[Korea]], to foster cultural exchanges, and to reform English teaching methodologies in Korea.  It is affiliated with the Korean Ministry of Education and is operated by the National Institute for International Education (NIIED).  Established in 1995,  EPIK encourages cross cultural exchange while promoting the development of English language competence for Korean students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPIK Rationale|url=http://www.epik.go.kr/EPIK/html/about_epik/rationale.jsp|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Formally created in 1995 under the name KORETTA, EPIK has placed Guest English Teachers in Korean classrooms for over a decade.  The program has undergone many administrative changes and is overseen by the NIIED.  Currently, participants live and teach in 16 different Provinces and Metropolitan cities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epik.go.kr/EPIK/html/about_epik/timeline.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization==
EPIK is overseen by NIIED, a division of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST). EPIK provides recruitment and Guest English Teacher support from a central office in [[Seoul]].  In conjunction with NIIED, Provincial Offices of Education offer assistance with various daily and work related affairs to Guest English Teachers.  Participants can seek guidance from representatives at their Provincial Office of Education and from EPIK.

[[File:Gordon Research Conference on Nucleic Acids, New Hampton 1964 Wellcome L0042631.jpg|right|thumb|Gordon Research Conference, 1964]]

'''Gordon Research Conferences''' are a group of prestigious international [[scientific conference]]s organized by a [[non-profit organization]] of the same name.  The conference topics cover frontier research in the [[biology|biological]], [[chemistry|chemical]], and [[physics|physical]] sciences, and their related technologies.  The conferences have been held since 1931, and have expanded to almost 200 conferences per year.  Conference locations are chosen partly for their scenic and often isolated nature, to encourage an informal community atmosphere.  Contributions are "off-record" to encourage free discussion, often of unpublished research.  Conferences were extended to cover [[science education]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = First Gordon Research Conference on Science Education|journal = [[J. Chem.

==History==

The forerunner of the Gordon Conferences was the summer sessions held at the chemistry department of [[Johns Hopkins University]] in the late 1920s. By 1931 this had evolved into a graduate seminar that was also attended by external participants.  The Gordon Research Conferences were initiated by Prof. [[Neil Gordon]] while at the Johns Hopkins University.&lt;ref name="jhist"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed075p1373 | title = Journal History: Guiding the Journal of Chemical Education | journal = [[Journal of Chemical Education]] | volume = 75 | pages = 1373–1380 | year = 1998| bibcode = 1998JChEd..75.1373. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John Pringle, 1st Baronet''', [[Presidents of the Royal Society|PRS]] (10 April 1707 – 18 January 1782) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[physician]] who has been called the "father of military medicine" (although [[Ambroise Paré]] and [[Jonathan Letterman]] have also been accorded this [[sobriquet]]).

==Biography==

===Youth and early career===
John Pringle was the youngest son of [[Sir John Pringle, 2nd Baronet]], of [[Stichill]], [[Roxburghshire]] (1662–1721), by his spouse Magdalen (d. December 1739), daughter of [[Sir Gilbert Eliott, 3rd Baronet, of Stobs]].

He was educated at [[St Andrews University|St Andrews]], at [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]], and at [[Leiden University|Leiden]]. In 1730 he graduated with a degree of Doctor of Physic at the last-named university, where he was an intimate friend of [[Gerard van Swieten]] and [[Albrecht von Haller]].

He settled in [[Edinburgh]] at first as a physician, but between 1733 and 1744 was also Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University.

In 1742 he became physician to the [[John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair|Earl of Stair]], then commanding the British army in [[Flanders]]. About the time of the [[battle of Dettingen]] in Bavaria in June 1743, when the British army was encamped at [[Aschaffenburg]], Pringle, through the Earl of Stair, brought about an agreement with the [[Adrien Maurice de Noailles|Marshal of Noailles]], the French commander, that military hospitals on both sides be considered as neutral, immune sanctuaries for the sick and wounded, and should be mutually protected. The [[International Red Cross]], as constituted by the modern [[Geneva Conventions]],&lt;ref&gt;"Article 1. Ambulances and military hospitals shall be recognized as neutral, and as such, protected and respected by the belligerents as long as they accommodate wounded and sick. Neutrality shall end if the said ambulances or hospitals should be held by a military force." [https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=1A60DC7BD5ED4FB6C12563CD00515301 Article&amp;nbsp;1 of the ''Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field. Geneva, 22 August 1864''].&lt;/ref&gt; developed from this conception and agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/misc/evprev/ch2.htm The Evolution of Preventive Medicine in the United States Army 1607–1939: The Colonial Period (1607–1775)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1744 he was appointed by the [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] physician-general to the forces in the [[Low Countries]]. In 1749, having settled in a smart house in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], [[London]], he was made [[physician in ordinary]] to the [[Duke of Cumberland]].

On 1 April 1752 he married Charlotte (d. Dec 1753) second daughter of Dr [[William Oliver (physician)|William Oliver]] (1695–1764) of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], the inventor of [[Bath Oliver]] biscuits, but they had no issue.

In 1760, he wrote an appreciation of the Life of General [[James Wolfe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pringle|first=John (Bt)|url=http://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.20293/3?r=0&amp;s=1|title= Life of General James Wolfe, the conqueror of Canada, or, The elogium of that renowned hero : attempted according to the rules of eloquence with a monumental inscription Latin and English to perpetuate his memory|location=London|year=1760|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 1766 John Pringle was created a baronet, and in 1774 he was appointed Physician to His Majesty King [[George III]].

He was also a frequent travelling companion to [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The successful London bookseller [[Andrew Millar]] noted Pringle and Franklin as dinner guests at his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/1.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to Andrew Mitchell, 26 August, 1766. Andrew Millar Project. University of Edinburgh.|website=www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
His first book, ''Observations on the Nature and Cure of Hospital and Jayl Fevers'', was published in 1750, and in the same year he contributed to the ''Philosophical Transactions'' of the [[Royal Society]] three papers on ''Experiments on Septic and Antiseptic  Substances'', which gained him the [[Copley Medal]]. Two years later he published his important work, ''Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison'', which entitles him to be regarded as the founder of modern [[military medicine]].

In November 1772 he was elected [[President of the Royal Society]], a position he held until 1778. In this capacity he delivered six discourses, which were afterwards collected into a single volume (1783).

In 1735, Pringle became a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]].

Pringle was a regular correspondent and friend of [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]], the Scottish philosopher. Monboddo was an important thinker in pre-evolutionary theory, and some scholars actually credit him with the concept of [[evolution]]; however, Monboddo was also quite eccentric, which was one reason for Monboddo's not receiving credit for the evolution concepts. It was in a letter to Pringle in 1773 that Monboddo revealed he did not really hold to a belief of men being born with tails, which was the chief point of his ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Lord Monboddo to Sir John Pringle, 16 June 1773; reprinted by William Knight 1900 {{ISBN|1-85506-207-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 73 he went, briefly, to Edinburgh in 1780, but returned to London in September 1781, and died in the following year.

==Legacy==
There is a monument to Pringle in [[Westminster Abbey]], executed by [[Joseph Nollekens]]. At Sir John's death his baronetcy became extinct.

After a legal case in 2004, the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] was able to open the Pringle papers it holds to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Historic manuscripts on display|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4007407.stm|newspaper= [[BBC News]] |date= 13 Nov 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5448">'''Josephine (Pipö) de Karman''' was the sister and life-partner of [[Theodore von Kármán]]. She is remembered as the  benefactor of a foundation for worthy art students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dekarman.org/ Josephine de Karman Fellowship Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Budapest]], Josephine was the younger sister of four brothers: Elemer, Feri, Teodor, and Miklos.&lt;ref name=TvK&gt;[[Theodore von Kármán]] with Lee Edson (1967) ''The Wind and Beyond'', [[Little, Brown and Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} She and her mother joined Theodore when he became director of the [[aerodynamics]] laboratory in [[Aachen, Germany]]. They lived in nearby [[Vaals]], the [[Netherlands]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our home in Vaals was similar to my father’s home in Buda. It had a huge high-ceilinged salon, a library, and numerous guest rooms. It was big, comfortable and altogether amiable. We eventually hired a Hungarian cook who became our most prized possession. My mother and my sister easily took over the organization of my social life, leaving me free for intellectual pursuits. … On weekends we threw open our home to students, assistants and visitors. My mother and my sister had made it a rule always to be prepared for unexpected guests, with coffee, cake, and [[slivovitz]]. In a short time, our home became a ''gemütlich'' meeting ground for a thousand ideas expressed, I must admit, at a high noise level in French, Italian, Hungarian, Dutch, English, and of course German. ... These sorties in internationalism were so successful that my sister suggested one day that we ought to do something to maintain regular contact with scientists in other countries ... because of the influence of our father who taught us to have a world view.&lt;ref name=TvK/&gt;{{rp|103,4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
With the help of [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] of the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] they organized for 1922 the "world’s first international conference in mechanics" in [[Innsbruck, Austria]]. Theodore recalled, "My sister and I paid the secretarial expenses out of our own pockets."
:My sister, I must mention, was ideally equipped for international conferences. For one thing, she was blessed with a remarkable linguistic talent and not only spoke Hungarian, German, French, English, and Spanish fluently, but she had great facility in picking up new and strange tongues as well. I recall that on a Mediterranean cruise some years ago she found herself at home with Turkish ship’s personnel and was soon talking Turkish although she had never heard the language before.&lt;ref name=TvK/&gt;{{rp|104,5}}
When Theodore was recruited to direct the aerodynamics laboratory at [[Caltech]], the whole family moved:
:Our home life in Pasadena was a continuation of life in Aachen. My mother and sister had found a sprawling Spanish-style home on Marengo Avenue, with a huge dining room and living room and two wings where we could live independently of one another but find a common meeting place around a large oak dining-room table. In a few months we threw open our doors to students and other visitors and thereby continued in Pasadena the international ''gemütlichkeit'' we had enjoyed so much in Aachen. ... My sister Pipö was fond of the movie colony and our guests included writers, producers and actors … Among other guests generally collected by my sister were spiritualists, magicians and other odd characters whom we found in great abundance in Southern California.
When [[Enrico Fermi]] was visiting Pasadena, he asked Theodore whether it would be possible to visit a [[movie studio]]. "Since my friends and those of my sister included a number of [[Hollywood]] personalities, notably the Hungarian actors [[Paul Lukas]] and [[Bela Lugosi]], I had no difficulty arranging a luncheon for Fermi at the studios."&lt;ref name=TvK/&gt;{{rp|179}}

In 1951 Theodore and Pipö travelled to the dedication of the [[AEDC|Arnold Engineering Center]] at Tullahoma, Tennessee. After the dedication, on way to New York, she had a heart attack. She died in Pasadena on July 2, 1951. It was then that Theodore realized who he had lost:
:Little Pipö was not only my last family link to the past. She was also the organizer of the day-to-day details of my life, the sharer of my innermost feelings. She knew with an uncanny instinct when to keep me free from interruption when I was immersed in scientific work, and when to open the gate to entertainment and gaiety. I never realized until she was gone how close we were to each other and how much I depended on her.&lt;ref name=TvK/&gt;{{rp|327}}
Theodore was a founding partner of [[Aerojet]] corporation which grew rapidly. Unable to fund the growing operations, the founders were pressured to sell their stock in the company:
:I continued to hold out for a number of months, but after some negotiation [[General Tire]] finally made a concession I could not resist. The firm promised to contribute over $50,000 to a foundation for worthy art students set up in the name of my sister Pipö, if I would sell my Aerojet holdings ... touched by the pleasing corporate nod to the memory of my dear sister, I relinquished my remaining shares in 1953.&lt;ref name=TvK/&gt;{{rp|319}}

'''Joyce Dattner''' is a [[United States|U.S.]] [[life coach]] and works and resides in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Dattner was one of the six Vice Presidential candidates of the [[New Alliance Party]] and its candidate [[Lenora Fulani]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]] [http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1988&amp;minper=0&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0]. In that election, she and Fulani became the first women to achieve [[ballot access]] in all 50 states.

==Coaching==

Joyce Dattner is a life performance coach who believes that emotional, social and intellectual development is key to succeeding in life and in work. For twenty years, she has been helping individuals and groups reinitiate their capacity to grow into new careers and leadership positions.

As a coach, Joyce Dattner takes "life performance" literally—helping people see living as an evolving, creative act, and themselves as performers of more effective and satisfying ways of being in the world. Her clients learn the skills of improvising to produce qualitative change in how they relate to themselves, their colleagues and loved  ones. Specializing in personal and professional coaching in individual and group environments, Joyce helps clients grow to meet difficult career challenges—negotiating transitions from manager to executive or from employee to entrepreneur, navigating office politics, and handling diversity issues in the workplace.

Joyce Dattner founded and directs the [http://www.lifeperformancecoaching.com West Coast Center for Life Performance Coaching]. There she leads a training program for teachers, doctors, social workers, coaches, counselors and therapists in her performance-based approach to human development. In addition, she conducts long and short term training for community-based organizations throughout [[California]].

She has never been satisfied with accepting things as they are. As a young teacher in the 1970s she left a career in the [[New York City Public Schools]] system to search for more innovative approaches to learning and development. What she found was the groundbreaking discoveries of [[Fred Newman (philosopher)|Fred Newman]], founder of [[social therapy]], and [[Lois Holzman]], [[developmental psychologist]], who together created a unique performance-based approach to human development.

Driven by her commitment to helping people change themselves — and in the process, change the world — Joyce Dattner has become a leading practitioner of Newman and Holzman's approach, now used in youth development programs, private and public mental health centers, alternative school initiatives, and agencies and organizations servicing diverse populations in varied settings—from [[New York City]] to [[Los Angeles]] to [[Johannesburg]].

In addition to her coaching and training work in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], Joyce Dattner has traveled the globe serving as a faculty member of the [http://www.eastsideinstitute.org East Side Institute for Group and Short Term Psychotherapy] and working with [[Fortune 500]] companies as a senior trainer with the consulting firm, [http://www.performanceofalifetime.com Performance of a Lifetime (POAL)] in [[New York City]]. In [[Taiwan]] she trained the faculty and staff of non-governmental organizations, including [[community activists]], [[trade union]] organizers, [[teacher]]s, and [[sex workers]]. She's coached [[psychologists]], [[social workers]], and [[teacher]]s working with children and adults living in [[refugee]] centers in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Most recently, in July 2006, Joyce Dattner travelled to [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] to work with teachers and students at the university-level to advance their work with youth utilizing the performance approach to development and building community.

==Cultural==

Joyce Dattner is the founder and president of the [http://www.bacic.org Bay Area Center for Independent Culture (BACIC)], is a non-partisan, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to promoting human development through the use of an innovative performance and development based model. The non profit creates outside of school, educational and performing arts activities for hundreds of young people living in some of the Bay Area's poorest communities. BACIC sponsors community and experimental theatre, develop leadership training and pursue volunteer initiatives that build and strengthen communities. Programs produced by BACIC include the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070805004336/http://www.bacic.org/bayareaallstars.html Bay Area All Stars Talent Show Network] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070805004921/http://www.bacic.org/dct.html Developing Community Theatre].

==Politics==

Joyce Dattner, co-founder and Chair of [http://www.independentvoice.org IndependentVoice], a political [[non-profit]] 501(c)(4) organization, has played a leading role in the creation of cultural, educational, therapeutic and political initiatives concerned with human growth, democracy and development for the past three decades, including the country's largest anti-violence youth program, the [http://www.allstars.org All Stars Talent Show Network].

Joyce Dattner was one of the six [[United States Vice President|Vice Presidential]] candidates of the [[New Alliance Party]] (NAP) in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]].  The vice presidential candidates varied from state to state, but all were the running mates of [[Lenora Fulani]].  As a life coach, Dattner believes in the approaches of Fred Newman and [[Lois Holzman]], the former of whom was also the founder of the NAP.  In 1985 she had been a midwest coordinator for the party and a member of Fulani and Newman's "Rainbow Alliance."

Dattner was the chair of the [[San Francisco, California]] chapter of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America]]. Also, a president of the New York City Unemployed and Welfare Council in the 1970s and had run unsuccessfully for the [[New York State Assembly]].

'''''Gakushū juku''''' ({{lang-ja|[[wiktionary:学習塾|学習塾]]}}; see [[cram school]]) are private, fee-paying schools that offer supplementary classes often in preparation for key school and university entrance exams. The term is primarily used to characterize such schools in [[Japan]]. Juku’s typically operate after regular school hours, on weekends, and during school vacations.

==History==
Juku attendance rose from the 1970s through the mid-1980s; participation rates increased at every grade level throughout the [[compulsory education]] years. This phenomenon was a source of great concern to the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education]], which issued directives to the regular schools that it hoped would reduce the need for after-school lessons, but these directives had little practical effect. Some juku have branches in the [[United States]] and other countries to help children living abroad catch up with students in Japan.

While new media have been introduced into juku as instructional and delivery methods, traditional teaching is increasingly shifting to individual [[tutor]]ing. This shift is partly a response by the supplementary education industry to [[Demographics of Japan|declining numbers of children]] in Japan and the threat this decline poses to their industry.

==Structure and curriculum==

There are two types of juku, academic and nonacademic.

===Academic juku===

Academic juku can be roughly divided into categories.

* Locally based middle- or small-sized cram schools&lt;ref name="eij"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education-in-japan.info/sub109.html|title=education-in-japan.info|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Schools for salvaging dropouts or children who avoid regular school (free schools, etc.)&lt;ref name="eij" /&gt;
* Franchising cram schools&lt;ref name="eij" /&gt;
* Other miscellaneous types of cram schools&lt;ref name="eij" /&gt;

As of 2011, almost one in five children in their first year of [[primary school]] attended after-class instruction, rising to nearly all university-bound high schoolers.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21542222|title=Testing times|work=The Economist|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fees are around ¥260,000 ($3,300) annually.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

Academic juku offer instruction in the five required subjects: [[mathematics]], [[Japanese language]], [[science]], [[English language|English]], and [[social studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/chukyo/chukyo3/016/siryo/04092801/003/002.htm|title=中央教育審議会初等中等教育分科会教育課程部会教育課程企画特別部会（第２回）|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are best known and most widely publicized for their role as "cram schools", where children (sent by concerned parents) can study to improve scores on upper-secondary school [[entrance examination]]s. However, as seen above, there are also juku that provide supplementary education, whether remedial courses to help children falling behind in their studies, refresher courses to explain material in further detail, or courses that cover material on a higher level and thus appeal to children bored by the standardized class structure.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/27/world/how-do-japan-s-students-do-it-they-cram.html|title=How Do Japan's Students Do It? They Cram|date=27 April 1992|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonacademic juku===

Many other children, particularly younger children, attend nonacademic juku for [[piano]] lessons, [[art]] instruction, [[human swimming|swimming]], and abacus ([[soroban]]) lessons.

==Social influence==

Juku also play a social role, and children in Japan say they like going to juku because they are able to make new friends. Many children ask to be sent because their friends attend. Some children seem to like juku because of the closer personal contact they have with their teachers and, for students in crowded spaces like Tokyo in particular,&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt; the relief jukus can provide from small homes, family, television, Internet, and other distractions.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

To some observers, juku represent an attempt by parents to exercise a meaningful measure of choice in [[Education in Japan|Japanese education]], particularly for children attending [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].

==Controversy==

===Criticism===

Because of the commercial nature of most juku, some critics argue that they have [[profit (economics)|profit]] rather than [[education]] at heart. Shares in five juku chains are traded publicly, and 25 others were as of 1992 ready to issue stock as well.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

Not all students can afford to attend juku, but school and university test scores rise in direct proportion to spending on juku.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt; The average fee is $160 a month for elementary school and $175 a month for junior high school, but the best ones are several times that amount.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Japan spent $10.9 billion on tutoring and cram schools in 1991 alone,&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; including $9 billion on juku for students in the ninth grade or below&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; "almost double the figure spent [in 1985]."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; With poor students therefore at risk of falling behind, the social and economic [[economic inequality|inequality]] in what had been a relatively [[egalitarian]] approach to education, at least in public schools through ninth grade, is why Japan's powerful teachers' union does not support the juku institution.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

In response to these accusations,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"juku teachers and administrators say that since their schools are profit-making enterprises, they have to guarantee results to succeed. The results are easy to measure since they depend on how many graduates pass the examinations for private school. The profit motive, in other words, provides an incentive to create an atmosphere in which students want to learn."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The rise of juku is praised as a secret of Japanese success, a healthy reflection of a system of advancement based on merit. It is also criticized as forcing a new generation to surrender its [[childhood]] out of an obsession with status and [[rat race|getting ahead]]. 'Juku are harmful to Japanese education and to children,' said Ikuo Amano, professor of sociology at the University of Tokyo. 'It's not healthy for kids to have so little free time. It is not healthy to become completely caught up in competition and status at such a young age.'"&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For some, "the schools are also seen as reinforcing a tradition of rote learning over ingenuity."&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

===Merits===

In many ways, juku compensate for the formal education system's inability or unwillingness to address particular individual problems. "In a 2008 government survey, two-thirds of parents attributed the growing role of juku to shortcomings in public education,"&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt; such as the abolition of Saturday schooling (which therefore reduces the number of hours available to cover course material) and the reduction of curricular content (see [[Yutori education]]).

Juku offer a more personalized service&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt; "and many encourage individual inquisitiveness when the public system treats everyone alike. 'The juku are succeeding in ways that the schools are not,' an OECD report says."&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8121">[[Privately owned public space]]s (POPS) in [[New York City]] were introduced in a 1961 zoning resolution.  The city offers zoning concessions to commercial and residential developers in exchange for a variety of spaces accessible and usable for the public.  There are approximately 503 POPS&lt;ref name="APOPS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Privately Owned Public Space|url=http://apops.mas.org/|work=apops.mas.org/|publisher=Municipal Art Society|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 320 buildings in New York City and are found principally in [[Manhattan]].  Spaces range from extended sidewalks to indoor [[Atrium (architecture)|atriums]] with seating and amenities.  International attention was brought to POPS during the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement begun in 2011 in [[Zuccotti Park]].&lt;ref name="Meet Me at the Plaza"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kayden|first=Jerold S.|title=Meet Me at the Plaza|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/opinion/zuccotti-park-and-the-private-plaza-problem.html?_r=2&amp;|accessdate=5 November 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jorge Manuel do Carmo.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Manuel Carmo]]

'''Jorge Manuel do Carmo Pereira de Almeida''' (b.  [[Lisbon]], 1958 - 2015)  was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[artist]] and [[author]].

Having practised as a [[lawyer]], he performed, in earlier years, as a deputy to the [[Chairmanship]] of the [[Council of Ministers of Portugal|Council of Ministers]] during the VII [[Constitutional]] [[Government]], as [[Chairman]] of the European cooperation NGO Latin American Studies Institute, and as Chairman of the Board in various [[multinational companies]]. In the early 1980s, he studied [[painting]] at Ar.Co, [[Lisbon]] and since then devoted himself exclusively to [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[writing]]. His first exhibition dates from 1985 and he has since been present in many exhibitions and conferences in [[Portugal]] and abroad. In 2000 he was awarded the Mention of Honour by the I Painting Biannual Domingos Sequeira and, in 2007, the First Prize of the Portuguese Association for Institutional Communication.

==The author==

Manuel Carmo is, at present, consultant of the European Museum Forum (Portugal) and also consultant for Aporem (an association integrating 17 museums) international projects.

Since January 2007, he has accepted responsibilities in the Museum of Water of [[Coimbra]], as [[Executive director]] of the [[Cultural]] and Contents Department and is the Chairman of AABA Arts Editions.

He was the [[Bairro Alto]] Art Gallery’ Arts Director and as such organized important exhibitions of reputed painters, such as [[Andy Warhol]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Erró]], [[Gerard Schlosser]] and [[Joyce Tenneson]].

His life and work were the subject for a 30 min documentary, in 2005, produced by the Portuguese Public Television Channel [[RTP1]] in collaboration with Universidade Aberta, and broadcast through [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]] International channel.
 
Carmo was the single [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Painting|painter]] invited to submit a project  - Let’s Art! - to the [[UNESCO]] World Conferente on Education through the Arts, in 2006. Sanchez Bravo, the Chairman of the [[UNESCO]] Spanish Committee considers his painting as "a new nude and harmonious-musical path to transcend truth".

His most recent exhibition/performance in [[Portugal]], in 2005, entitled "1755 – the Cemetery of Hope or the 7 Virtues for Rebirth", evoking the 250th anniversary of the [[Lisbon]] 1755 earthquake, was honoured by the high patronage of H.E. the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], Mr. [[Jorge Sampaio]].

In 2006, at the "[[Angel Orensanz Center|Angel Orensanz Foundation Center for the Arts]]", in [[New York City]], he exhibited a set of works on the creative act in Art, named "Manifesto 24", which included [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[video]]. On this exhibition, the New-Yorker art reviewer Nancy di Benedetto said, “the best homage one may pay to '''Manuel Carmo''' is the acknowledgement that his works do not belong to any predetermined schools nor [[Art movement|movements]] as they challenge categorization and opens the path for new territories for the [[Arts]] in the twenty first century”.   
 
Carmo is regularly invited to lecture on [[Art]], within the scope of activities of [[UNESCO]], "Collect and Share" and "Life Long Learning" projects, and also the [[European Union|EU]] "[[Socrates]]" and "[[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]]" programmes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5165">The '''Michigan Mathematics Prize Competition (MMPC)''' is an annual high school mathematics competition held in Michigan. First founded in 1958, the competition has grown to include over 10,000 high school participants (although middle-schoolers may also participate through a high school). The director and host of this competition changes every three years, the most recent director being Stephanie Edwards of Hope College. This competition consists of two parts, which are added together to determine score:

: Part I: A 40 question, multiple-choice exam open to all Michigan high schoolers

: Part II: A 5 question, proof exam given only to the Top 1000 scorers on Part I

The Top 100 scorers on the combined score of both parts of the competition are honored at an awards banquet, usually at the host university, although recent years have seen more than 100 people being awarded due to ties.

==Problem difficulty==

The problems on the competition range from basic [[algebra]] to [[precalculus]] and are within the grasp of a high schooler's mathematical knowledge. The contest contains concepts from a variety of topics, including [[geometry]] and [[combinatorics]].

== Grading ==

Part I has 40 multiple-choice questions. One point is awarded for each correct answer, giving a maximum score of forty points.

Part II has five ten point proof-based problems. The test is graded out of fifty points. This part is weighted x1.2, so the total amount of points possible is 60. 

The highest possible score on this test is 100 points (summing the Part I and Part II scores).

It is common for the winner of the competition to score anywhere from 90 to 95 points due to the difficulty of the exam. It sometimes falls even lower due to especially tough exams. 

The only perfect scores were achieved in 2015, by Ankan Bhattacharya of International Academy East, and in 2016, by Chittesh Thavamani and Freddie Zhao, both of Troy High School. 2016 also marked the year of the highest scoring 3rd, 4th, and 5th place winners in MMPC history with 3rd place scoring 99 points, 4th place scoring 98.8 points, and 5th place scoring 97.6 points.

==Awards==

The Top 100 are invited to an awards banquet. Although the Top 50 are denoted as "bronze," no actual medal is awarded. Likewise, the Top 10 and Top 3 are called "silver" and "gold" (respectively) but do not receive medals.

The Lower 50 are deemed "honorable mentions" and receive a gift card/certificate/book.

Everyone in the Top 50 receives a scholarship ranging in size from $250 to $2500

In the 2012 contest, Akhil Nistala became the first winner in Novi High School history, breaking a streak of 6 consecutive top scorers for Detroit Country Day School.

The  '''Ministry of Human Resource Development''', formerly '''Ministry of Education''' (until 25 September 1985), is responsible for the development of human resources in [[India]]. The Ministry is divided into two departments: the Department of School Education and Literacy, which deals with primary, secondary and higher secondary education, [[adult education]] and [[literacy]], and the [[Department of Higher Education (India)|Department of Higher Education]], which deals with university education, technical education, scholarship etc. The erstwhile Ministry of Education now functions under these two departments, as of 26 September 1985.

The Ministry is headed by the cabinet-ranked Minister of Human Resources Development, a member of the [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of India|Council of Ministers]]. The current HRD minister is [[Prakash Javadekar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smriti-irani-removed-as-hrd-minister-javadekar-gets-the-post/story-gh3D2Pc4GR9h6KtwI0thVL.html/ Cabinet reshuffle on 05 July 2016]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Department of School Education and Literacy== 
The Department of School Education and Literacy is responsible for development of school education and literacy in the country. It works on "universalisation of education" and for the cultivation of higher standards for citizenship among the youth of India.

==Department of Higher Education==
{{main article| Department of Higher Education (India)}}
The Department of Higher Education is in charge of secondary and post-secondary education. The department is empowered to grant [[deemed university]] status to educational institutions on the advice of the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) of India, under Section 3 of the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act, 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UGC Act-1956|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/upload_document/ugc_act.pdf|website=mhrd.gov.in/|publisher=Secretary, University Grants Commission|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IISST) Thiruvanathapuram Declared as Deemed to be University |url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=40292 |date=14 July 2008 |publisher=Ministry of Human Resource Development (India), Press Information Bureau |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= IIST gets deemed university status |url= http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/15/stories/2008071550100100.htm|date=15 July 2008 |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Higher Education takes care of one of the largest higher education systems of the world, just after the United States and China. The department is engaged in bringing world-class opportunities of higher education and research to the country so that Indian students are not found lacking when facing an international platform. For this, the government has launched joint ventures and signed MoUs to help the Indian student benefit from the world opinion. The technical education system in the country can be broadly classified into three categories – Central Government funded institutions, State Government/State-funded institutions &amp; Self-financed institutions. The 122 Centrally funded institution of technical and science education are as under: List of CFTIs (Centrally Funded Technical Institutions): IIITs (4 – Allahabad, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Kancheepuram), IITs (16), IIMs (13), IISc, IISER (5), NITs (30), NITTTRs (4), and 9 others (SPA, ISMU, NERIST, SLIET, IIEST, NITIE &amp; NIFFT, CIT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mhrd.gov.in/funded_technical_inst_hindi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701154313/http://mhrd.gov.in/funded_technical_inst_hindi |archivedate=1 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organisational structure===
The department is divided into eight [[Government agency|bureaus]], and most of the work of the department is handled through over 100 autonomous organisations under these bureaus.&lt;ref name=or&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/orgastru.asp ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929124603/http://education.nic.in/orgastru.asp |date=29 September 2010 }} [[Department of Higher Education (India)|Department of Higher Education]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Munna Shukla''' (born December 7, 1943) is a [[Kathak]] guru and choreographer of [[Lucknow]] [[Gharana]] based in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. Born to a family who has been involved in dance for generations, Munna Shukla specializes in Kathak, a classical dance form of North India. He is a grandson of the noted [[Kathak]] Maestro, Late [[Achhan Maharaj]], and a nephew of [[Birju Maharaj]].

In 2006, he was awarded the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]], the highest award for performing artists, conferred by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama.
==Training==
Shukla received his initial training in Kathak from his father, late Sunder Lal Shukla, and later on from [[Birju Maharaj]] in New Delhi under the National Scholarship Scheme offered by the Ministry of Culture. During his training, he participated in many productions and gave several solo performances in the major cities of India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11958">A '''neutral buoyancy pool''' or '''neutral buoyancy tank''' is a pool of water in which [[neutral buoyancy]] is used to [[Neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid|train astronauts]] for [[extravehicular activity]] and the development of procedures. These pools began to be used in the 1960s and were initially just recreational [[Swimming pool|swimming pools]]; dedicated facilities would later be built.

[[File:Aldrin Gemini XII 3.jpg|thumbnail|right|Buzz Aldrin training at the McDonogh School for his Gemini 12 spacewalk]]
Prior to May 1960, NASA recognized the possibility of underwater neutral buoyancy simulations, and began testing their efficacy. NASA engaged Environmental Research Associates, a company based in [[Baltimore]], to try neutral buoyancy simulations first in a pool near [[Langley Research Center]]. Visitors and other issues disturbed those efforts, so they moved the operation to a swimming pool at the [[McDonogh School]] in Maryland, where [[Scott Carpenter]] was the first astronaut to participate [[spacesuit|suited]]. Then, after difficult [[extravehicular activity|EVA]]s through [[Gemini 11]] in mid-September 1966, the Manned Spacecraft Center (later renamed the [[Johnson Space Center]]) fully understood the importance of testing procedures underwater, and sent the [[Gemini 12]] crew to train at McDonogh.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Raphael B.:  Null-Gravity Simulation.

The first had a diameter of {{convert|8|ft|m|sp=us|order=flip}} and a depth of {{convert|8|ft|m|sp=us|order=flip}}. The second tank was built in 1966 and had a diameter of {{convert|25|ft|m|sp=us|order=flip}} and a depth of {{convert|15|ft|m|sp=us|order=flip}}. A third tank was added around 1968 for Skylab and other planned projects; it had a diameter of {{convert|75|ft|m|sp=us|order=flip}} and was {{convert|40|ft|m|sp=us|order=flip}} deep.

Training in the NBS decreased when the Johnson  Space Center opened its own neutral buoyancy pool in 1980, it eventually was closed in 1997.&lt;ref name=EVATrain/&gt;

====Water Immersion Facility (WIF)====
WIF was used for the Gemini and Apollo programs and was located in Building 5 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

In the late 1980s, NASA began to consider replacing the WETF, which was too small to hold useful mock-ups of many of the space station components planned for [[Space Station Freedom|Space Station ''Freedom'']], which later morphed into the [[International Space Station]]. NASA purchased the then-processing facility from [[McDonnell Douglas]] in the early 1990s, and began refitting it as a neutral-buoyancy training center in 1994 with construction ending in December 1995. The NBL began operation in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Swimming with spacemen: training for spacewalks at NASA’s giant pool|last=Hutchinson|first=Lee|date=4 March 2013|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/swimming-with-spacemen/|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Old Glory''''' is a 1939 ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[animation|animated]] cartoon directed by [[Chuck Jones]], produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], and released to theatres by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[Vitaphone|The Vitaphone Corporation]]. It premiered at the famed [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] at Los Angeles on July 1, 1939 - three days before [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]].

==Plot==
The uniquely serious Schlesinger-produced cartoon retells the origins of the [[United States|United States of America]]. [[Porky Pig]] plays a child attempting to learn the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. He becomes quickly bored and falls asleep. In his dream, [[Uncle Sam]] (voiced by John Deering)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0214385/&lt;/ref&gt; comes to life and teaches Porky about history from [[Colonial America]] through the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|midnight ride]] of [[Paul Revere]] (voiced by [[Shepperd Strudwick]]) and the [[American Revolutionary War]] to the expansion of the [[American Old West]], briefly alluding to [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Upon awakening, Porky snaps into a salute and recites the pledge as the [[Flag of the United States]] waves overhead and the words "The End" pan over the waving flag. There are no [[Merrie Melodies]] rings at the end, as in other shorts, or the words "That's All, Folks!"
The ending card reads "Merrie Melodies, Reg. U.S. Pat. Off," "The End" "Produced by Leon Schlesinger" , and "Released by Warner Bros. Pictures Incorporated".

==Production==
The animation in ''Old Glory'' is realistic and heavily [[rotoscope]]d, different from the usual Warner Bros. style. Director Chuck Jones was known for his [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-like style during this period, and Schlesinger assigned him to make this cartoon for that reason. The scene with [[Patrick Henry]] (voiced by [[John Litel]]) saying his "[[Give me Liberty, or give me Death!|Give Me Liberty]]" speech was rotoscoped from the Warner Bros. color 2-reel historical short, ''[[Give Me Liberty (1936 film)|Give Me Liberty]]''. That short won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Best Short Subject - Color]] of 1936. Also rotoscoped were scenes from the live-action short [[Declaration of Independence (film)|Declaration of Independence]] (1938).&lt;ref name="Sigall"&gt;Sigall (2005), p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many different tones of colored inks used on the film. Uncle Sam has different tones on his hat, beard, face, and clothes. All the other characters were treated in a similar manner. There were many cels depicting the [[Flag of the United States]] in its stars and stripes.&lt;ref name="Sigall"&gt;Sigall (2005), p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the existence of more footage than usual, the short ran for 9 minutes. The average length of a Looney Tunes or Merrie Melodies entry was 6 or 7 minutes.&lt;ref name="Sigall"&gt;Sigall (2005), p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was produced during a heat wave in Los Angeles. Due to the lack of air conditioning at the studio, the production staff initially relied on two large fans to keep cool. They had to be pointed at the ceiling so that they did not blow cels and drawings across the room. Eventually production moved to night time, since the temperature dropped at night.&lt;ref name="Sigall"&gt;Sigall (2005), p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Leon Schlesinger animated shorts were first screened at the Warner Bros. Theater at the [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. This film was instead screened at the more prestigious [[Carthay Circle Theatre]]. All animation studio employees were invited to attend.&lt;ref name="Sigall"&gt;Sigall (2005), p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; The film was screened alongside the live-action ''[[Dark Victory]]''.&lt;ref name="Sigall"&gt;Sigall (2005), p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

The original ending was cut when the cartoon was reissued twice as a Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies short, in 1945 and 1953. A version with a restored ending can be found on the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2|Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 2]]'', Disc 3, ''[[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1|Looney Tunes Platinum Collection Vol. 1]]'', Disc 1 and ''Porky Pig 101'', Disc 3. This copy retains the Blue Ribbon opening, as well as the original opening shot of the flag and its music cue.

''Old Glory'' is Jones's first short to feature Porky Pig. It is also Porky's first appearance in a colour Merrie Melody since his debut in 1935's [[I Haven't Got a Hat]], and his first short in three-strip Technicolor.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Jerry, editor. The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes Cartoons. San Rafael, CA: Insight Editions. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s, ''Old Glory'' was regularly screened between [[rock music|rock]] acts at [[the Fillmore]] in [[San Francisco]]. Many of the Fillmore's patrons drew great amusement from a pig saluting the American flag, as "pig" in 1960s slang was a derogatory term for a police officer and his saluting the flag was a symbol of the kind of America most people were against at the time: the kind that slavishly followed the government and didn't care for the rights of others.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Zarifopol''' (November 30, 1874 – May 1, 1934) was a [[Romania]]n literary and social critic, essayist, and literary historian. The scion of an aristocratic family, formally trained in both philology and the [[sociology of literature]], he emerged in the 1910s as a rebel, highly distinctive, voice among the Romanian press and book reviewers. He was a confidant and publisher of the Romanian writer [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], building his theories on Caragiale's already trenchant appraisals of Romanian society and culture. Zarifopol defended [[art for art's sake]] even against the [[Marxism]] of his father-in-law, [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], and the [[Poporanism]] of his friend, [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]]. He was also a noted censurer of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] trends, of [[philistinism]], and of inauthentic customs, advocating renewal, but not revolution. A skeptic reviewer of [[modernist literature]], he reemerged during the interwar as its dedicated promoter, but his preference for literary entertainment over substance and many of his literary bets were shortly dismissed by other experts of the day.

Zarifopol endures in cultural memory as an eccentric—not just because he tackled and derided the literary establishment, but also because he refused to publish most of his work in book form, or take up employment in academia. Having lost a considerable fortune, he lived withdrawn from the public eye, surviving on his revenues as a literary columnist, mostly for Ibrăileanu's ''[[Viața Românească]]''. Shortly before his death, he set up his own successful magazine, ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]''. In such venues, Zarifopol defended his cosmopolitan philosophy against other philologists, but also against the emerging neotraditionalists at ''[[Gândirea]]'' journal. Zarifopol viewed modern traditionalism as a fabrication and, with his essays, came out as a non-traditionalist and anti-[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] conservative thinker.

==Biography==
===Origins and early life===
The future critic was born in [[Iași]] to Paul (Pavel) Zarifopol, or "Zarifopoulo", and his wife Elena (''née'' Culiano). His paternal family had attested [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]],&lt;ref name="izjnote"&gt;"Biographical Note", in Ilinca Zarifopol-Johnston, ''Searching For Cioran'', p. 271. Bloomington: [[Indiana University Press]], 2009.  {{ISBN|978-0-253-35267-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more generically "southern" or [[Balkans|Balkan]],&lt;ref name="evmicle"&gt;{{ro icon}} Elena Vulcănescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/VULCANESCUsep10.html "Veronica Micle era bunică. Documente și corespondență inedite"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Muthu]], "Discussions. Sur le roman historique balkanique et sud-est européen", in ''Revue Des Études Sud-est Européennes'', Nr. 1/1977, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; roots. Originally horse traders and assignees for [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] settled in [[Moldavia]], they were elevated into the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|Moldavian boyar nobility]] after 1850.&lt;ref name="izjnote"/&gt;

On his mother's Culiano side, Paul was related to prestigious literary and political figures. One of Elena's brothers&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; was [[Nicolae Culianu]], the boyar, astronomer, and doyen of ''[[Junimea]]'' literary society, great-grandfather of the religious scholar-novelist [[Ioan Petru Culianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Anton, ''Eros, Magic, &amp; the Murder of Professor Culianu'', pp. 31–32, 233. Evanston: [[Northwestern University Press]], 1996.  {{ISBN|0-8101-1396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other maternal uncle, who remained closest to Elena, was jurist Ștefan "Nei" Stamatiu-Culianu, also a ''Junimea'' man. A sister of theirs, Maria Nanu, was the wife of landowner Gheorghe Nanu—making Paul Jr a first cousin of poet [[D. Nanu]].&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt;

The elder Zarifopol managed the estates of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[Mihail Sturdza]] in [[Cristești, Iași|Cristești]]. It was there that he and Elena met. According to scholar Elena Vulcănescu, it is possible that Paul Jr was not his natural son, but born to Elena from a liaison with General [[Grigore Sturdza]], heir to the Sturdza estate.&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; Zarifopol eventually bought for himself the [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] manor and Sturdza property at [[Filipești|Cârligi]], near [[Roman, Romania|Roman]], then a townhouse in Iași, where he and Stamatiu-Culianu managed Borta Rece tavern.&lt;ref name="evststam"&gt;{{ro icon}} Elena Vulcănescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/VULCANESCUmar12.htm "La un portret inedit al junimistului Ștefan Stamatiu-Culianu zis Nei"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers George and Ștefan Zarifopol both had careers in local politics—the former, a Paris-trained agronomist,&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; as a [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]], the latter as a delegate to [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber]].&lt;ref name="evststam"/&gt; Paul Sr was the great-uncle of poet [[Dimitrie Anghel]];&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; another of his nephews, Alexandru Zarifopol, was the adoptive father of writer [[Alexandru Paleologu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Tudorel Urian, [http://www.romlit.ro/familia_paleologu_ipoteze_legende_fantezii_ii "Familia Paleologu: ipoteze, legende, fantezii (II)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 45/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Sr died in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Stamatiu in charge of family affairs.&lt;ref name="evststam"/&gt; Their family fortune helped finance both sides of the family, and the Culianu children were all educated abroad.&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; Paul Jr himself graduated from ''Junimea''{{'}}s ''Institutele-Unite'' private high school,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 910&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the literature faculty of [[Iași University]], from 1892 to 1898.&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;[[Mircea Muthu]], "Zarifopol Paul", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', Vol. II, pp. 868–869. Pitești: [[Editura Paralela 45]], 2004.  {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his published debut in [[Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol]]'s ''Arhiva'' in 1897, with a review of a historiographical work by [[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodica Florea, "Reviste și scriitori în ultimele două decenii ale secolului al XIX-lea", in [[Șerban Cioculescu]], [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', p. 975. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, he wrote a short story, ''Povestea Moșului'' ("The Tale of the Old Man"). Well-liked by his literary friends [[Gheorghe T. Kirileanu]] and [[Paul Bujor]], it was published in ''Carmen Sylva'' magazine under the pen name of "Z.".&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Bădară, "G. T. Kirileanu în colecțiile Bibliotecii Centrale Universitare Carol I", in ''Revista Bibliotecii Naționale a României'', Nr. 2/2006, pp. 46, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Zarifopol's professor, [[Alexandru Philippide]], took him on as an assistant and considered him for a likely successor; Zarifopol excused himself, and recommended the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] intellectual [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] for that position. As he noted, Tiktin was more qualified, despite being targeted by a "rather violent antisemitic current".&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Nastasă, ''Antisemitismul universitar în România (1919-1939)'', pp. 47–48. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Institutului pentru Studierea Problemelor Minorităților Naționale, 2011, {{ISBN|978-6-06-927445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Zarifopol left for [[German Empire|Germany]] to specialize in philology (under [[Hermann Suchier]]),&lt;ref name="ln(10)295"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy, as a student of [[Alois Riehl]]'s [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist worldview]].&lt;ref&gt;Florian, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; He took a doctorate at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]] in 1904, with a dissertation on [[trouvère]] [[Richard de Fournival]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;

===Caragiale companion===
On April 25, 1903,&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; at Berlin, Zarifopol married Ștefania (Fany) Dobrogeanu-Gherea, the daughter of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]. Zarifopol was an atheist;&lt;ref name="esstein"&gt;[[Eugen Simion]], "Nicolae Steinhardt", in ''Caiete Critice'', Nr. 1–2/2007, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Fany was Jewish, and, like Zarifopol, a religious nonconformist. The couple turned up at the marriage registrar in street clothes and neither held a church wedding nor baptized their children; all this outraged his mother, a strict [[Romanian Orthodox]].&lt;ref name="s407"&gt;Săndulescu, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; Dobrogeanu-Gherea, a literary critic, and his son [[Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea|Alexandru]] were also [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrinaires; Alexandru's daughter, also called Fany, was married to [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]'s son [[Luca Caragiale|Luca (Luki)]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 710, 1017&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting his in-laws, Zarifopol met various figures of international socialism, including revolutionist [[Karl Radek]].&lt;ref name="vtstilist"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], [http://www.lapunkt.ro/2014/07/21/un-stilist-al-ideilor-paul-zarifopol-si-snobismul-mesianic/ "Un stilist al ideilor: Paul Zarifopol și snobismul mesianic"], in ''LaPunkt'', July 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zarifopols had two children: daughter Sonia (born 1904), and son Paul (born 1905).&lt;ref name="s407"/&gt; Selling their Cârligi home in 1906,&lt;ref name="evststam"/&gt; the new family settled in [[Leipzig]], where Paul developed a friendship with Caragiale the elder, who frequently visited from Berlin; with [[Dimitrie Gusti]] and [[Panait Cerna]], he is described by Caragiale biographers as the comedic writer's closest Romanian friends in old age,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 495; Iosifescu, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; or even, with an affinity in "sneering spirits", as his one true friend.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship proved decisive in Zarifopol's evolution as a critic, but also left a trace on Caragiale's style: Zarifopol introduced him to the work of [[Anatole France]].&lt;ref&gt;Iosifescu, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Until Caragiale's death in 1912, he and Zarifopol pursued a steady correspondence. Sometimes involving [[kitsch]] postcards they each collected for their involuntary humor,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ștefan Cazimir]], ''Caragiale față cu kitschul''. Bucharest: [[Cartea Românească]], 1988, p. 103.  {{OCLC|21523836}}&lt;/ref&gt; such exchanges were noted for witticisms and ridicule of traditional writers. They also shed light on Caragiale's intellectual, psychological, and artistic evolution, making Zarifopol a prime reference in that field.&lt;ref&gt;Iosifescu, pp. 322, 326, 327–329, 339, 344, 345, 351, 352, 355, 358&lt;/ref&gt;

Fany and Sonia Zarifopol are kneeling to Zarifopol's left; Paul the younger is front row, held in her arms by pianist [[Maria Cernovodeanu]]]]
From 1908 to 1911, Zarifopol contributed to the [[Munich]]-based ''[[Süddeutsche Monatshefte]]''.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; Also a correspondent for the Romanian literary press, his writing broke with the older canons of Romanian literary criticism and brought him to the attention of Dobrogeanu-Gherea disciple [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]].&lt;ref name="ln(10)295"/&gt; Co-opted by the latter to write for ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Zarifopol made himself known for sarcastic comments about [[modernist literature]], describing [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[André Gide|Gide]], and [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]] as difficult "boys and children".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he persuaded Ibrăileanu to publish there a novel written in collaborations by two of his brothers-in-law, Luki and [[Ionel Gherea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/n_numele_fiului "În numele fiului"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 10/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the latter, he also supervised the debut of a female novelist, [[Lucia Demetrius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Lucia Demetrius]], [http://www.romlit.ro/memorii "Memorii"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 4/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Zarifopol and his family returned to Romania.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; By then, World War I had broken out, with Romania settled in uneasy neutrality [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|until 1916]]. For much of that interval, Zarifopol was a literary contributor for [[Tudor Arghezi]]'s ''Cronica'', but did not necessarily share the magazine's radical stances, nor its anti-war "[[Germanophilia]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''"Germanofilii". Elita intelectuală românească în anii Primului Război Mondial'', p. 103. Bucharest: [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], 2010.  {{ISBN|978-973-50-2635-6}}; Iorga, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Romania in World War I|campaigns of 1916–1917]], Zarifopol and his family remained in Iași; all of southern Romania fell to the Germans. For a while, accepting Ibrăileanu's offer, he returned to his alma mater as a substitute professor, replacing C. Fedeleș (presumed missing in action). Upon Fedeleș's unexpected return, Zarifopol was sacked.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 295–296&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1916, the family took refuge in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], settling for a while in Moscow, but were driven out by the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt;

===Interwar losses and recovery===
Described by historian Lucian Nastasă as a withdrawn, "[[Neurasthenia|neurasthenic]]" and "very impractical" person,&lt;ref name="ln(10)296"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol was financially ruined in the monetary devaluation that took place after the war.&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; He supported himself by turning to regular journalism, but still had trouble making ends meet (though he did not admit to it), and made efforts to keep away from the centers of culture, living mostly in provincial [[Sinaia]].&lt;ref name="ln(10)296"/&gt;

Zarifopol, sometimes using the pen names ''PZ'' and ''Anton Gherman'',&lt;ref&gt;Mihail Straje, ''Dicționar de pseudonime, anonime, anagrame, astronime, criptonime ale scriitorilor și publiciștilor români'', p. 805. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1973.  {{OCLC|8994172}}&lt;/ref&gt; returned as one of the main columnists at ''Viața Românească'' and its satellite, ''[[Adevărul Literar și Artistic]]''. Despite his material difficulties, Zarifopol categorically refused Ibrăileanu and [[Petre Andrei]]'s offers to take a professorate at Iași. In early 1920, he complained that the "endless infirmities of my children, my wife, and myself" prevented him from publishing his cultural journalism as an academic volume, which would have qualified him for the office.&lt;ref name="ln(10)296"/&gt; In 1924, Zarifopol informed his protectors that he now had "a holy terror of officialdom", and that he resented Iași for its support for the [[National-Christian Defense League]], a form of "nationalist imbecility and charlatanry". As he noted: "all things considered, I can make a living from journalism alone."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;

A guest writer at [[Camil Petrescu]]'s ''Săptămâna Intelectuală și Artistică'' in 1924,&lt;ref&gt;Sdrobiș, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1925, at ''[[Cuvântul Liber (1924)|Cuvântul Liber]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1926), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol became more deeply involved in the cultural debates of [[Greater Romania]]. This was the time of his explicit emancipation from Dobrogeanu-Gherea's left-wing [[didacticism]] and from Ibrăileanu's [[Poporanism]]. Didactic and social art, Zarifopol contended, had no real artistic value, and politics were irrelevant in assessing the quality of artistic endeavor. Revising some of his earlier pronouncements on modernism, he now believed in [[art for art's sake]], illustrated by such qualities as "pleasure", "amusement", "life", "drama", "color", "strange sensibilities", or "childish delirium".&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1926), pp. 273–276&lt;/ref&gt; His refusal of didactic art aimed higher, showing up in his celebrated essay on [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata|Kreutzer Sonata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dima, pp. 170–171, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Working from Sinaia, Zarifopol translated and prefaced an anthology of fantasy short stories, published in 1924 as ''Vedenii'' ("Visions"). Part of his essays were published as ''Din registrul ideilor gingașe'' ("A Register of Tender Ideas", 1926), ''Despre stil'' ("On Style", 1928), ''Artiști și idei literare române'' ("Artists and Ideas in Romanian Literature", 1930), and ''Încercări de precizie literară'' ("Essays in Literary Precision", 1931).&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025; Grinea Mironescu, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarifopol's dissidence was admonished by other ''Viața Românească'' veterans Ibrăileanu and [[Mihai Ralea]]. Ibrăileanu took in some of Zarifopol's criticism, but argued that some of Poporanism's theories were rehabilitated in [[psychologism]] or [[social determinism]], without which "an artwork can never hope to be fully understood".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine's literary columnists even accused Zarifopol of committing a "crime" against taste at ''Adevărul Literar și Artistic'', where Zarifopol was introducing [[Aestheticism|aestheticist]] guidelines, albeit with contributions that remained "interesting and profound".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Zarifopol's derision of traditionalism and [[mysticism]] showed lasting similarities with Ralea's philosophical stances. In 1928, Ralea, Zarifopol, [[D. I. Suchianu]], [[Felix Aderca]] and other literati were lumped together as the "irresponsible malcontents", in a neotraditionalist pamphlet put out by [[Petre Pandrea]] and ''[[Gândirea]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

In his replies, Zarifopol noted that he did not reject mysticism as a cultural phenomenon, only objecting to the "career mysticism" of traditionalist ideologues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], ''Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptă românească'', p. 77. Bucharest: [[Editura Fundației Culturale Române]], 1995.  {{ISBN|973-9155-43-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contested by young and old critics alike, Zarifopol found himself a follower with [[Mihail Sebastian]], who honored him as "a lucid man in a time of visionaries", "a sober teetotaler during a raging drinking bout".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Diana Pîrvan-Jenaru, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Mihail-Sebastian-si-arta-de-a-polemiza*articleID_18475-articles_details.html "Mihail Sebastian și arta de a polemiza"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 393, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol's cultural role, Sebastian wrote, was that of a "policeman", a "reactionary", who would curb the excesses of mysticism, ''[[Trăirism]]'', and nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioan Stanomir]], [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-nr-12008-4231.html "Semne pe un dulap cu cărți"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 931, January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final creative period and death===
Zarifopol eventually moved to [[Bucharest]] in 1928,&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; taking up residence on Strada Spătarului, [[Moșilor]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 82, 328&lt;/ref&gt; Slowly discarding social and literary criticism in favor of philology,&lt;ref name="pcon264"&gt;Constantinescu, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; he worked on a critical edition of Caragiale's works; he put out the first three volumes (1930, 1931, 1932), winning a prize from the [[Romanian Writers' Society]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; In March 1929, together with [[Gala Galaction]], [[Nicolae L. Lupu]] and others, he put out the monthly magazine ''Hanul Samariteanului'', which only published a single issue.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'', p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he became a writer for [[Isac Ludo]]'s mainly Jewish review, ''Adam'',&lt;ref&gt;Camelia Crăciun, "Presa culturală evreiască din România în timpul Holocaustului: cazul revistei ''Adam''", in Anca Ciuciu, Camelia Crăciun (eds.), ''Istorie și memorie evreiască. Volum omagial dedicat doamnei Dr. Lya Benjamin'', p. 140. Bucharest: [[Editura Hasefer]], 2011.  {{ISBN|978-973-630-228-2}}. See also Crohmălniceanu, p. 345; Desa ''et al.'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and, in ''Viața Românească'', published his review of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[aesthetics]] (''Kant și estetica'').&lt;ref&gt;Dima, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; His other contributions appeared in various new magazines and newspapers, including ''[[Adevărul]]'' (which in 1927 hosted his humorous memoir of a meeting with Radek),&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; ''[[Dreptatea]]'', ''[[Kalende]]'', ''[[Lamura (magazine)|Lamura]]'', ''Gazeta Fălticenilor'', and ''Ancheta''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'', pp. 38–39, 330, 433, 557, 571&lt;/ref&gt;

He carried on with his lampoons of traditionalism, publishing, in 1932, an especially mordant portrait of historian [[Vasile Pârvan]], ''Plicticoase fantome'' ("Tedious Apparitions").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru George]], [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=1228&amp;editie=59 "Cu cât pierdem un mit..."], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 18/2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion]]'', a debate club for political and cultural factions, one of the "old men" who were called upon as both arbiters and active participants. He and Ralea were thus present when the debates about Gide, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]] either degenerated into squabbles or were broken up by the far-right Defense League.&lt;ref name="imcrit"&gt;{{ro icon}} Irina Manea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/criterion-o-istorie "Criterion – o istorie"], in ''Historia'', May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Zarifopol was named editor-in-chief of ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'',&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agm8"&gt;Grinea Mironescu, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; the official literary magazine, which was largely conceived by him.&lt;ref name="ovsc171"&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1934, he was involved with ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' in round-table talks that were supposed to revive ''Criterion''.&lt;ref name="imcrit"/&gt; These projects ended abruptly when Zarifopol died of a heart attack on May 1, at 12 AM,&lt;ref name="gc909"&gt;Călinescu, p. 909&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly while visiting his mistress, musicologist Lisette Georgescu.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mihail Sebastian]], ''Journal, 1935-1944''. London: [[Random House]], 2003, p. 59.  {{ISBN|0-7126-8388-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was [[Cremation in Romania|cremated]] on May 3,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; with Camil Petrescu succeeding him at ''Revista Fundațiilor Regale''.&lt;ref name="ovsc171"/&gt;

His most important work as a literary critic appeared posthumously in 1934; called ''Pentru arta literară'' ("For Literary Art"), it was praised by Sebastian as "a model of precise understanding of values and of their order".&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; In 1935, [[Șerban Cioculescu]] put out a critical edition of the Caragiale–Zarifopol correspondence, while editing new volumes from the Caragiale corpus, which Zarifopol had begun publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 239, 269–270, 277. See also Călinescu, p. 1001; Iosifescu, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Generic traits===
Once settled in his role as [[art for art's sake]] advocate, Zarifopol created himself a confrontational niche, earning both respect and bewilderment from his readers. A traditionalist adversary, [[Nicolae Iorga]], recognized Zarifopol as a "refined and daring thinker",&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; while his ''Viața Românească'' partner Ralea called him "charming and irritating".&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea identified in him "a freethinker" with "the courage of looking truth in the face", but essentially a "freezing intelligence" of "destructive anarchism", a man "alone within his sarcasm".&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, pp. 162–164&lt;/ref&gt; A more virulent review came from classicist [[George Călinescu]], who proposed that Zarifopol's one original note was "continuous and systematic persiflage, to the point of annoyance". He attributed such traits to Zarifopol's familiarity with "two sophistic races", Greeks and Jews,&lt;ref name="gc909"/&gt; his claim in turn criticized by Ralea&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''Capcanele istoriei. Elita intelectuală românească între 1930 și 1950''. Bucharest: [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], 2012, p. 243.  {{ISBN|978-973-50-3533-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosopher [[Mircea Florian]]&lt;ref&gt;Florian, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; for its racialist undertones. Florian also discussed the constructive side of Zarifopol's work, arguing that accusations of "bourgeois anarchism" and "iconoclasm" were prejudiced.&lt;ref&gt;Florian, pp. 169, 170&lt;/ref&gt; Another sympathetic reviewer, Andreea Grinea Mironescu, sees Călinescu's pronouncements as "minimizing and petty."&lt;ref name="agm8"/&gt;

[[Eugen Lovinescu]], the modernist literary theorist, shared Zarifopol's overall aesthetic goals, but not his methods: Zarifopol, he writes, was an unlikely follower of [[Titu Maiorescu]]'s non-didactic school of "aesthetic autonomy" and authenticity, which had emerged at ''[[Junimea]]'' in the 1860s, and had also influenced Caragiale.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), pp. 289, 291&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, [[Nicolae Bagdasar]] identified in Zarifopol "a vastly cultured critic, of a rare subtlety and fine irony", lamenting that his work "remains scattered in so many magazines".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Bagdasar]], "Estetica", in Nicolae Bagdasar, [[Traian Herseni]], S. S. Bârsănescu (eds.), ''Istoria filosofiei moderne, V. Filosofia românească dela origini până astăzi'', p. 253. Bucharest: Romanian Philosophical Society, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; However, as argued by colleague [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]], this improvidence was a fundamental trait and shortcoming of Zarifopol's literary contribution: his was a "newspaperman's critique" of "spontaneous impression, quick analysis, and incomplete assessment, meaning that he could never embrace a creator in all their complexity."&lt;ref name="pcon264"/&gt; The same was noted by Călinescu, who argues that Zarifopol's "journalistic method" relied on explicit [[Argumentum ad populum|appeals to popularity]] and [[False precision|spurious accuracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 910–911&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovinescu assessed that Zarifopol's criticism "lingers in the paradox", always placing itself "at the antipodes of common sense": denying merit to prestigious figures such as [[Ernest Renan|Renan]] or [[Guy de Maupassant|Maupassant]], but praising [[Ion Minulescu]] as an outstanding novelist. His "practical" verdicts, Lovinescu notes, remain "disoriented", "regrettable".&lt;ref name="el(26)272–3"&gt;Lovinescu (1926), pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledges Zarifopol's "stylistic rigor", but concludes that his is "an equation in which the unknown is better left unknown",&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1926), pp. 276–277&lt;/ref&gt; something "virtually alien to the rhythms of our literary movement."&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; The same was argued decades later by Lovinescu disciple [[Nicolae Manolescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinea Mironescu, pp. 8, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ralea, Zarifopol should be read as a Romanian counterpart of anti-populist "lone travelers", from [[Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly|Barbey d'Aurevilly]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]], often applauding causes that were "at odds with the establishment".&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, pp. 159–161&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, responding to the established literary canons, Zarifopol fashioned himself an alternative one, comprising Caragiale, Minulescu, Proust and Cocteau, but also [[Joseph Delteil]], [[Henri de Régnier]], [[Adrian Maniu]], [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]],&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1926), pp. 275–276. See also Balotă, p. 215; Grinea Mironescu, p. 9; Zalis, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dragoș Protopopescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu believes that Zarifopol was most "intelligent" in his essays on Proust and [[Gustave Flaubert]], where he overcame his usual "journalistic banality".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 911&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic ideals===
Zarifopol's rejection of [[neoclassicism]], from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] to [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]], but also his friend [[Panait Cerna]], had to do with both its "mechanic" use of poetic imagery and its communication of "bland truths".&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, pp. 215–218, 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred archaic Moldavian forms, that he found resonating in the poetry of [[Dosoftei]] and [[Vasile Alecsandri]].&lt;ref&gt;Zalis, pp. 7, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu was especially critical of Zarifopol literal and "negativist" reading of [[Alexandru Vlahuță]]'s ''Din prag'', which ridiculed the poet's presentment of death eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 909–910&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a sustained attack, equated by comparatist [[Nicolae Balotă]] with "a holocaust of poetry",&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless impressed Lovinescu. The latter declared himself in agreement with the thesis that ancient models were perishable, and that traditionalist art was implicitly false.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1926), p. 273; (1943), pp. 290–291&lt;/ref&gt; Seen by [[Alexandru Paleologu]] as a more radical anti-classicist than Zarifopol ever was,&lt;ref&gt;Grinea Mironescu, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Lovinescu noted in 1943: "as modernism or synchronism, I have been supporting those same ideas these past twenty years."&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol's revolt was more contextual, and bound by his own debt to the classics: Ralea sees him as a classical [[Rationalism|rationalist]] in the manner of [[Voltaire]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]], and [[Anatole France]],&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, pp. 162, 168, 170&lt;/ref&gt; and Călinescu as a "cultured academic, for all his freethinking airs", copying his style from Caragiale and [[Tudor Arghezi]], without "a sense of the sublime".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 909, 910&lt;/ref&gt; Balotă also finds Zarifopol a "suppressed scholar", "in denial of his formative background".&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

Călinescu sees Zarifopol a man of little classical culture, his "obviously German method" being more akin to the [[sociology of literature]].&lt;ref name="gc909"/&gt; Such verdicts were nuanced by another literary historian, [[Alexandru Dima]], who suggests that Zarifopol did have contribution to the scholarly study of [[aesthetics]], one which "imposes itself even against his own wish."&lt;ref&gt;Dima, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol's rejection of [[scientism]] and [[historicism]] had deep roots in ''Junimism'' and [[Neo-Kantianism]], but Zarifopol also criticized Kantian [[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime|assumptions about the sublime]], finding them too indebted to ethical imperatives.&lt;ref&gt;Dima, pp. 171–175; Lovinescu (1943), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Dima, his attachment to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] was "at the very least formal".&lt;ref&gt;Dima, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; According to Balotă, his applications of the art for art's sake principle show that, despite his own claims to the contrary, Zarifopol borrowed his [[poetics]] from [[Henri Brémond]], [[Paul Valéry]], and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, pp. 218–221&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social critic===
Revisiting Zarifopol's moralizing essays in 2007, critic [[Henri Zalis]] found him to be "chaste and meticulous, and in this unmatched."&lt;ref&gt;Zalis, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; ''Din registrul ideilor gingașe'', is, according to Lovinescu, an "interesting intellectual spectacle of deliberate originality".&lt;ref name="el(26)272–3"/&gt; This is one of several essays containing Zarifopol's ''Junimea''-like satire of inauthentic ''mofturi'' ("trifles" or "coquetries", a term echoing Caragiale), including wholesale borrowings of foreign customs that respond to bourgeois tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 909; Lovinescu (1943), pp. 290–292; Ralea, pp. 160–161, 167–171&lt;/ref&gt; The eponymous "tender ideas" were defined by Zarifopol as "those which should be familiar to any man wishing to pass for cultured, and also those that said man must be careful to speak about just so, lest he insult the views of society"; the book was addressed to those skeptics who, rejecting cultural crazes, "still value consistency".&lt;ref name="cmsging"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cassian Maria Spiridon]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAmar13.htm "Ideile gingașe și actualitatea lor contondentă"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As Ralea notes, Zarifopol's anti-ideological critique, continuing the work of Caragiale, was specifically deriding philosophers and philosophies that were the height of fashion: mystical, [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonian]], [[Japonism|Japonist]];&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, pp. 161, 167–168, 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; other such hobbyhorses were [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzscheism]]&lt;ref name="cmsging"/&gt; and [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name="gc909"/&gt;

Călinescu was unimpressed by Zarifopol's "rather belated" satire of bourgeois mores, since "the bourgeois is no longer that ridiculous conservative figure".&lt;ref name="gc909"/&gt; Yet, Zarifopol was not entirely anti-middle class: he believed his type of "cold lucidity" was primarily an in-built antidote to the decay of the "colossal civilization" that was liberal society.&lt;ref&gt;Florian, pp. 170–171; Ralea, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; He issued what Florian calls a "passionate call to order of the bourgeoisie, [which is] still a bearer of cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;Florian, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Himself a conservative, Zarifopol expressed his nostalgia for old-regime [[Differentiation (sociology)|social differentiation]] and [[division of labor]], against "the political type", and for the [[nuclear family]] of [[patriarchy]], against the "neutralization" of fathers in modern society. He criticizes both [[Francophilia]] and [[Germanophilia]], noting that, although competing, they each supported [[deindividuation]]: the former, through [[corporatism]]; the latter, through [[militarism]].&lt;ref name="cmsging"/&gt; While targeting [[philistinism]], ''Din registrul...'' is itself an [[Anti-intellectualism|antiintellectualist]] manifesto. Zarifopol contended that intellectuals were an illusory social class (no economic interest bound together "a lawyer with a novelist"), but still collectively responsible for the failures of a society such as Romania's.&lt;ref&gt;Sdrobiș, pp. 312–313&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarifopol took distance from more radical antiintelectualist stances, communist as well as Christian; but also noted that natural disunity between intellectuals meant that [[communist terrorism]] was itself an intellectuals' affair.&lt;ref name="cmsging"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sdrobiș, pp. 313–314&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Din registrul...'' an other writings show him as an [[anti-Soviet]] in line with [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], and believed that [[Leninism]] was a somewhat worrisome, but generally puerile, non-philosophy.&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; Like [[fascism]] and, historically, [[Bonapartism]], it stood for a "simplistic autocratic drive" and "stupefied blindness". Moreover, Zarifopol rejected [[Marxist literary criticism]], with its discourse of [[base and superstructure]], seeing it as the source of modernist kitsch.&lt;ref name="cmsging"/&gt;

In 2014, posthumously reviewing Zarifiopol's anticommunist notes, scholar [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]] described him as a diagnostician of "totalitarian reflexes", displaying "urbanity, civility, moderation and firmness".&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; Evidence also exists that, beyond this public persona, Zarifopol was more illiberal. Prolonging his [[Antihumanism|antihumanist]] tendencies,&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; he expressed in private his reserves for the "deplorable" literature of "the oppressed", including Jews, social climbers, and especially women; according to Nastasă, he was an [[Antifeminism|antifeminist]], and perhaps also a misogynist.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, writer [[Barbu Brezianu]] suggested that Zarifopol was on the "far-right" of Romanian literature, in the "grand conservative party" of [[D. Nanu]], [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], and [[Al. T. Stamatiad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Barbu Brezianu]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/BREZIANUfeb8.html "Curs de literatură politică"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Fany Zarifopol, born in 1876, lived until 1945. Paul Jr spent seventeen years as a political prisoner under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]],&lt;ref name="s407"/&gt; being released with a general amnesty in 1964.&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; Officially designating him a "bourgeois idealist",&lt;ref&gt;S. Mureșeanu, "Recenzii. ''Istoria gîndirii sociale și filozofice în România''", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 1/1965, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] prevented Zarifopol's essays from being either reprinted or quoted before the mid 1960s liberalization. When they were finally returned to circulation, large parts of his work were still being bracketed out.&lt;ref&gt;[[Monica Lovinescu]], ''Unde scurte'', p. 146. Bucharest: [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], 1990.  {{ISBN|973-28-0172-7}}; Grinea Mironescu, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonia Zarifopol, who never married,&lt;ref name="s407"/&gt; was a lover of literature and, in the 1930s, a discreet presence at Lovinescu's ''[[Sburătorul]]'' society.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Bianca Burța-Cernat, [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=2963&amp;editie=127 "''Sburătorul'': fotografie de grup cu scriitoare uitate"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 3/2011&lt;/ref&gt; She kept her father's entire collection of manuscripts and documents, now housed at the [[Museum of Romanian Literature]]. She died in 1981, and her brother three years later; neither had children of their own.&lt;ref name="s407"/&gt; George Zarifopol's son,&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; Constantin Radu "Dinu", was a published novelist.&lt;ref name="raczibloo"&gt;{{ro icon}} Raluca Alexandrescu, Christina Zarifopol-Illias, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Bloomington-Indiana-o-activa-ambasada-romaneasca.-Interviu-cu-Christina-ZARIFOPOL-ILLIAS*articleID_5855-articles_details.html "Bloomington, Indiana: o activă ambasadă românească"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 19, July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Ilinca, marginalized at home for her aristocratic descent, emigrated to the United States in 1977. A linguist and comparatist, she taught at [[Indiana University Bloomington]], marrying Anglicist Kenneth R. Johnston.&lt;ref name="izjnote"/&gt; She was joined there by her sister Christina Zarifopol-Illias, who organized the Bloomington Romanian Studies Program.&lt;ref name="raczibloo"/&gt;

The critical reappraisal of Zarifopol, begun by [[Eugen Simion]] in 1956, was taken up in the 1980s by Paleologu and [[Marin Mincu]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinea Mironescu, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; In underground culture, his memory was cultivated by the essayist [[Nicolae Steinhardt]]. Although a fervent Orthodox, he viewed the non-believers Zarifopol and Ralea as intellectual standards, praising their "quick wit".&lt;ref name="esstein"/&gt; From 1971, [[Al. Săndulescu]] was allowed to publish selections of Zarifopol's literary prose,&lt;ref name="agm8"/&gt; and, in 1987, Zarifopol's correspondence (at [[Editura Minerva]], with samples in ''[[Manuscriptum]]'' magazine).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 50, 206, 247, 296, 359, 369, 427&lt;/ref&gt; A more thorough recovery came after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], when more complete anthologies first emerged, and Zarifopol monographs were published by [[Alex. Cistelecan]].&lt;ref name="agm8"/&gt; In 1992, his formerly censored critique of socialism was issued by [[Editura Albatros]] as a standalone book, ''Marxism amuzant'' ("Amusing Marxism").&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; His Bucharest home was not fitted with a memorial plaque—the new owners having reportedly refused to allow it.&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 163, 237, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Frame''' (April 16, 1957 – August 30, 2018) was an American ballet dancer and dance teacher. He danced with [[New York City Ballet]] from 1976 until 1990 and was elevated to the rank of principal dancer in 1988. He was a faculty member at the [[School of American Ballet]] from 1993 until his death in 2018.

== Early life ==
Peter Frame was born on April 16, 1957 in [[Charleston, West Virginia]] to Marvan and Mary Elizabeth Frame. He was one of five children and had a twin brother, [[Paul Frame]], who also danced with New York City Ballet.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wral.com/peter-frame-ballet-dancer-and-instructor-dies-at-61/17813959/|title=Peter Frame, Ballet Dancer and Instructor, Dies at 61 :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his ballet training under the direction of Jerry Rose.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/obituaries/peter-frame-dead.html|title=Peter Frame, Ballet Dancer and Instructor, Dies at 61|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Frame enrolled at the [[School of American Ballet]] before joining the [[New York City Ballet]], where he danced for fourteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/ny-ent-peter-frame-suicide-20180902-story.html|title=Ballet star Peter Frame jumps to his death, one day after choreographer Paul Taylor died - NY Daily News|first=Brian|last=Niemietz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Frame, then a soloist, was selected to re-stage ''Variations, Opus 30'' from ''[[Episodes (ballet)|Episodes]]'', a collaborative work between [[George Balanchine]] and [[Martha Graham]] set to music by [[Anton Webern]], that had originally been performed by [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; ''Episodes'' had been dropped from the ballet in 1961, after Taylor stopped performing the solo, until it was taught to Frame. He was promoted to the rank of principal dancer in 1988&lt;ref name="sab.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sab.org/summer_programs/faculty/peter_frame_weight_training.php|title=Peter Frame, Weight Training · School of American Ballet|website=www.sab.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, shortly after his first performance of ''Episodes''.&lt;ref name="albawaba.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.albawaba.com/editorchoice/peter-frame-ex-nyc-ballet-dancer-falls-death-his-apartment-1180766|title=Peter Frame, Ex-NYC Ballet Dancer, Falls to Death From his Apartment|date=4 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later Frame performed as a guest artist with [[Paul Taylor Dance Company]].&lt;ref name="albawaba.com"/&gt; In 2014 Frame staged ''Episodes'' for [[Miami City Ballet]], the first time it had been performed since he had danced the role.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1979 Frame was an original cast member of the ballets ''[[Sonate di Scarlatti]]'' and ''[[The Four Seasons (ballet)|The Four Seasons]]''. In 1981 he danced in the ballet ''[[In the Night (ballet)|In the Night]]''. In 1983 he danced in the ballet ''[[Interplay (ballet)|Interplay]]''. He was an original cast member of the 1983 ballet ''[[Glass Pieces]]''. In 1987 he was an original cast member of the ballet ''[[Ecstatic Orange]]''.

After retiring from the stage in 1990, he joined the faculty at the School of American Ballet in 1993 where he taught strength training and conditioning classes for male dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pointemagazine.com/peter-frame-death-2600748699.html|title=Remembering Peter Frame, Former New York City Ballet Principal &amp; Beloved Teacher|date=31 August 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sab.org"/&gt; He also began teaching at Ballet Academy East in 1999.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Death == 
Frame died on August 30, 2018 after committing suicide by jumping out of his fifth-story apartment at 145 West 75th Street on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]], the day after [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]] died of renal failure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/tributes-to-new-york-ballet-dancer-peter-frame-after-his-death-aged-61-a3926481.html|title=Tributes to New York ballet dancer Peter Frame after his death aged 61|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="albawaba.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.westsiderag.com/2018/08/30/man-jumps-to-his-death-from-building-on-75th-street|title=West Side Rag  » Man Jumps to His Death from Building on 75th Street|website=www.westsiderag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">'''Pietro Alfieri''' (June 1801 &amp;ndash; 12 June 1863) was a Roman Catholic priest and at one time a [[Camaldolese]] monk, who was born and died in Rome.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Pietro Alfieri |volume=1 |first=James Alphonsus |last=Völker |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, Alfieri was the professor of singing at the [[English College, Rome|English College]] in Rome.  He is remembered chiefly for his scientific writings and his collections of music of the old masters. Perhaps his most valuable work is his "Raccolta di Musica Sacra" in seven large volumes, a reprint of the sixteenth-century church music, mostly by [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], which was supplemented by later and smaller collections, such as "Excerpta ex celebrioribus de musicâ viris" (Rome, 1840), and "Raccolta di Motetti" (Rome, 1841). On plain chant he published "Accompagnamento coll' organo" (Rome, 1840); "Ristabilmento del canto e della musica ecclesiastica" (Rome, 1843); "Saggio storico del canto Gregoriano" (Rome 1845); "Prodromo sulla restaurazione de' libri di canto Gregoriano" (Rome, 1857). He also translated into Italian [[Catel]]'s "Traité d'harmonie" and contributed to the "Gazzetta musicale di Milano" and other periodicals many articles on church music of great value to the student.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

The game focuses on players operating as a mayor whose task is to build up a city, providing basic transit links, power, and simplistic service needs for their residents, while watching out for problems and dealing with a multitude of disasters, most of which are based on real-life disasters. Alongside the option to make a city from scratch, the game also features scenarios that task players to oversee a pre-built city and deal with specific issues that it faces, most of which require the player to rebuild after a disaster.

Released initially for the Macintosh computer, the game was ported onto various gaming platforms. ''SimCity'' received critical acclaim upon release, becoming a commercial success and establishing the title as one of the all-time greats in city-building simulation games, spawning several sequels as a result - ''[[SimCity 2000]]'' in 1993, ''[[SimCity 3000]]'' in 1999, ''[[SimCity 4]]'' in 2003, ''[[SimCity DS]]'', ''[[SimCity Societies]]'' in 2007, and ''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]]'' in 2013. The game became the best-selling Maxis title on PC, until the eventual release of the series spin-off ''[[The Sims (video game)|The Sims]]'' in 2000.

==Gameplay==

The objective of ''SimCity'' is to build and design a [[city]], without specific goals to achieve. The player can mark land as being [[zoning|zoned]] as [[commerce|commercial]], [[industry|industrial]], or [[residential]], add buildings, change the [[tax]] rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and take many other actions, in order to enhance the city. Once able to construct buildings in a particular area, the too-small-to-see residents, known as "Sims",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Will|author2=Joffe, B. |title=SimCity: thematic mapping+city management simulation=an entertaining, interactive gaming tool|journal=GIS/LIS '89 Proceedings. Annual Conference|date=November 1989|volume=2|pages=591–600|publisher=American Congress on Surveying and Mapping; American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|location=Orlando, FL, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; may choose to construct and upgrade houses, apartment blocks, light or heavy industrial buildings, commercial buildings, hospitals, churches, and other structures. The Sims make these choices based on such factors as traffic levels, adequate electrical power, crime levels, and proximity to other types of buildings—for example, residential areas next to a [[power plant]] will seldom appreciate to the highest grade of housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/ealbert_2001_1.pdf "SimCity Classic: History and Review"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628203447/http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/ealbert_2001_1.pdf |date=2011-06-28 }}, Eric Albert, February 2001. Fetched from URL 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] version and later, the player can also build rewards when they are given to them, such as a mayor's [[mansion]] or a [[casino]].

The player may face [[disaster]]s including [[flood]]ing, [[tornado]]es, [[fire]]s (often from [[Aviation accidents and incidents|air disasters]] or [[shipwreck]]s), [[earthquake]]s and attacks by [[Godzilla|monsters]]. In addition, monsters and tornadoes can trigger [[train wreck|train crashes]] by running into passing trains.

===Scenarios===
''SimCity'' includes goal-centered, timed scenarios that could be won or lost depending on the performance of the player. The scenarios were an addition suggested by Brøderbund in order to make ''SimCity'' more like a game.&lt;ref name = "CGW"&gt;{{citation | date = May 1989 | last = Wilson | first = Johnny L. | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = What Do The "Sim"ple Folk Do? | pages = 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original cities were based on real world cities and attempted to re-create their general layout. While most scenarios either take place in a fictional timeline or have a city under siege by a fictional disaster, a handful of available scenarios are based on actual historical events.

==Development==
[[File:Micropolis - big city.png|left|thumb|A large developed city in ''Micropolis'' version (2007)]]
''SimCity'' was developed by [[game designer]] [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]]. While working on the game ''[[Raid on Bungeling Bay]]'', in which the player flies a helicopter dropping bombs on islands, Wright found he enjoyed designing the islands in the [[level editor]] more than playing the actual game.&lt;ref name="Keighley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/maxis/index.html |title=SIMply Divine |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2008-06-07 |first=Geoff |last=Keighley |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204115211/http://www.gamespot.com/features/maxis/index.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to develop increasingly sophisticated level editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Wright was cultivating a love of the intricacies and theories of urban planning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Scoop – The History of SimCity |url=http://simcity.ea.com/about/inside_scoop/sc_retrospective.php |publisher=Electronic Arts Inc |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710162034/http://simcity.ea.com/about/inside_scoop/sc_retrospective.php |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledges the influence of [[System Dynamics]] which was developed by [[Jay Wright Forrester]] and whose book on the subject&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forrester|first=Jay W.|title=Urban dynamics|year=1969|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-262-06026-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the foundations for what would become ''SimCity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Space time play computer games, architecture and urbanism : the next level|year=2007|publisher=Birkhauser|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-8415-9|editor1=Friedrich Borries |editor2=Steffen P.

[[Brøderbund]] declined to publish the title when Wright proposed it, and he pitched it to a range of major game publishers without success. Finally, Braun, founder of the tiny software company Maxis, agreed to publish ''SimCity'' as one of two initial games for the company.&lt;ref name="Keighley"/&gt;

Wright and Braun returned to Brøderbund to formally clear the rights to the game in 1988, when ''SimCity'' was near completion. After Brøderbund executives [[Gary Carlston]] and [[Don Daglow]] saw ''SimCity'', they signed Maxis to a distribution deal for both of its initial games. With that, four years after initial development, ''SimCity'' was released for the [[Amiga]] and [[Macintosh]] platforms, followed by the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] and [[Commodore 64]] later in 1989.&lt;ref name="SimCity.com (history)"/&gt;

==Ports and versions==
[[File:SimCity-Indigo.gif|right|thumb|Multiplayer mode on the [[SGI Indigo]] workstation]]
''SimCity'' was originally released for [[home computer]]s, including the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[DOS]]-based [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]. After its success it was converted for several other [[Platform (computing)|computer platforms]] and [[video game console]]s, specifically the [[Macintosh]], [[Acorn Archimedes]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Acorn Electron]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (which was later released on [[Virtual Console]]), [[EPOC (computing)|EPOC32]], [[mobile phone]], [[Internet]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[FM Towns|FM-Towns]], [[OLPC XO-1]] and [[NeWS]] HyperLook on Sun [[Unix]]. The game is available as a multiplayer version for [[X Window System|X11]] [[Tcl|TCL]]/[[Tk (computing)|Tk]] on various [[Unix]], [[Linux]], [[DESQview]] and [[IBM OS/2|OS/2]] operating systems. Certain versions have been re-released with various add-ons, including extra scenarios. An additional extra add on for the Windows version of ''SimCity Classic'' was a level editor. This editor could be opened without use of the disc. The level editor is a simple tool that allows the user to create grasslands, dirt land, and water portions.

A version was developed in 1991 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].&lt;ref name="orland20180112"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/see-the-long-lost-nes-prototype-of-simcity/ |title=See the long-lost NES prototype of SimCity |last=Orland |first=Kyle |date=2018-01-12 |website=Ars Technica |language=en-us |access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Super NES===
{{anchor|Super NES variation|Super Nintendo variation}}
''SimCity'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] features the same gameplay and scenario features; however, since it was developed and published by [[Nintendo]], the company incorporated their own ideas. Instead of the Godzilla monster disaster, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] of the [[Super Mario (series)|''Super Mario'' series]] becomes the attacking monster, and once the city reaches a landmark 500,000 populace, the player receives a [[Mario]] statue that is placeable in the city. The Super NES port also features special buildings the player may receive as rewards, such as casinos, large parks, amusement parks, and expo centers; some of which would be incorporated into ''SimCity 2000''. A bank can be built which will allow a loan of $10,000 to be taken, but it must be paid back before another loan can be taken out. The game includes schools and hospitals, though they cannot be placed by the player; instead, the game will sometimes turn an empty residential lot into one. There are city classifications, such as becoming a metropolis at 100,000 people. It has some of the same pre-set scenarios in the PC and Mac versions and two new ones. One is in Las Vegas under attack by aliens and another called Freeland. Freeland has no water and no rewards buildings are given. Also unique to the Super NES version is a character named "Dr. Wright" (whose physical appearance is based on Will Wright) who acts as an adviser to the player. The soundtrack was composed by Soyo Oka. The edition is featured as Nintendo's [[Player's Choice]] as a million seller.

In August 1996 a version of the game entitled ''BS Sim City Machizukuri Taikai'' was broadcast to Japanese players via the Super Famicom's [[Satellaview]] subsystem. Later, a sequel titled ''[[SimCity 64]]'' was released for [[Nintendo 64DD]], the Japan-only [[Nintendo 64]] add-on

| Developed and Published by Nintendo under license by Maxis, the Super NES version of ''SimCity'' had additional features not found in the original ''SimCity'', including graphics changing to match the seasons (trees are green in summer, turn rusty brown in the fall, white in the winter, and bloom as cherry blossoms in the spring), civic reward buildings, and a very energetic green-haired city advisor named Dr. Wright (after Will Wright), who would often pop up and inform the player of problems with their city. In addition, the Super NES version of ''SimCity'' had two additional bonus scenarios, accessible when the original scenarios were completed: Las Vegas and Freeland (see section on scenarios). The style of the buildings also resemble those in Japan rather than those of North America.

A [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] port was also planned, but was cancelled.

Nintendo also put their stamp on the game, with a dangerous disaster being [[King Bowser|Bowser]] attack on a city (in place of a generic movie-type monster), and a [[Mario]] statue awarded once the megalopolis level of 500,000 inhabitants is reached.

The Super NES version of ''SimCity'' has been released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service (No longer available as of January 2, 2013).

* The July 2005 issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' stated that a development cartridge of ''SimCity'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] was found at Nintendo headquarters. Never released, it is reportedly the only one in existence.
* Additionally a terrain editor and architecture disks were available with tileset graphics for settings of Ancient Asia, Medieval, Wild West, Future Europe, Future USA and a Moon Colony.
* Versions of ''SimCity'' for the [[BBC Micro]], [[Acorn Electron]], and [[Acorn Archimedes]] computers were published by [[Superior Software]]/[[Acornsoft]]. Programmer Peter Scott had to squeeze the 512k Amiga version of the game into 20k in order to run on the ageing 32k [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]]. Despite this, it kept almost all of the functionality of the Amiga game and very similar graphics (although only using four colours).
* DUX Software published a [[Unix]] version of ''SimCity'' for the [[NeWS]] window system using the HyperLook user interface environment, and a multi-player version of ''SimCity'' for the [[X Window System|X11]] window system using the [[Tcl|TCL]]/[[Tk (computing)|Tk]] user interface toolkit, both developed and ported to various platforms by [[Don Hopkins]].

The [[University of Southern California]] and [[University of Arizona]] used ''SimCity'' in urban planning and political science classes. In 1990 The ''[[Providence Journal]]'' invited five candidates for [[Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island]] to manage a ''SimCity'' town resembling the city; former mayor [[Buddy Cianci]], who was the most successful, won election that year.

==Legacy==
{{Main|SimCity|List of Sim video games}}
''SimCity'' yielded several sequels. "Sim" games of many types were developed{{spaced ndash}}with Will Wright and Maxis developing myriad titles including ''[[SimEarth]]'', ''[[SimFarm]]'', ''[[SimTown]]'', ''[[Streets of SimCity]]'', ''[[SimCopter]]'', ''[[SimAnt]]'', ''[[SimLife]]'', ''[[SimIsle: Missions in the Rainforest|SimIsle]]'', ''[[SimTower]]'', ''[[SimPark]]'', ''[[SimSafari]]'', and ''[[The Sims (video game)|The Sims]]'', as well as the unreleased ''[[SimsVille]]'' and ''[[SimMars]].'' They also obtained licenses for some titles developed in Japan, such as ''[[SimTower]]'' and ''Let's Take The A-Train'' (released as ''[[A-Train]]'' outside Japan). In 2000 ''[[The Sims (video game)|The Sims]]'' was released, which spawned [[The Sims|its own series]]. ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'', released in 2008, was originally going to be titled "''SimEverything''"{{spaced ndash}}a name that [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] thought might accurately describe what he was trying to achieve.

''SimCity'' inspired a new genre of video games. "[[Software toy]]s" that were open-ended with no set objective were developed trying to duplicate ''SimCity''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s success. The most successful was most definitely Wright's own ''[[The Sims]]'', which went on to be the best selling computer game of all time. The ideas pioneered in ''SimCity'' have been incorporated into real-world applications as well. For example, [[VisitorVille]] simulates a city based on website statistics.

The series also spawned a ''[[Sim City: The Card Game|SimCity]]'' [[collectible card game]], produced by [[Mayfair Games]].

Dr. Wright from the Super NES version has made appearances in several video games. He is a [[non-player character]] in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening]]'', and an assist trophy in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

'''Smart Sparrow''' is an ed-tech (education technology) start-up, the commercialization of an [[adaptive learning]] technology incubated within the Adaptive eLearning Research Group at the [[UNSW School of Computer Science and Engineering|School of Computer Science and Engineering]] at the [[University of New South Wales]] in Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref name="Smart Sparrow targets Next Generation Learning after securing first Round of Funding"&gt;{{cite news |last=Henderson, J.|title=Smart Sparrow targets Next Generation Learning after securing first Round of Funding|url=http://www.nsinnovations.com.au/news/2011-12-19~smart_sparrow_investment.html/|publisher=NewSouth Innovations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adaptive learning]] is an educational method using computers as interactive teaching devices, adapting educational material according to students' learning needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ejel.org/volume-2/vol2-issue1/issue1-art11-paramythis.pdf |title=Adaptive Learning Environments and e-Learning Standards |author1=Paramythis, A.  |author2=S.

The Smart Sparrow software tools, known collectively as the Adaptive eLearning Platform, are a web-based suite that develops adaptive learning content and applications, deploys that material to students and analyses how students learn from their responses to the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Sparrow - Adaptive eLearning Platform|url=https://www.smartsparrow.com/platform/|publisher=Smart Sparrow|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform implements an [[intelligent tutoring system]] that combines Constraint-Based Modeling with Model Tracing.&lt;ref name="A Comparative Analysis"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Comparative Analysis of Cognitive Tutoring and  Constraint-Based Modeling|last=Mitrovic, A., K. Koedinger and B.

In 2013, an educational white paper "LEARNING TO ADAPT: A Case for Accelerating Adaptive Learning in Higher Education" identified Smart Sparrow as one of six ‘notable’ adaptive learning platform providers.&lt;ref name="Learning to Adapt"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Newman A. |author2=P.

The same paper, part of a study funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], cited the impact of the Smart Sparrow platform on increasing enrollments and reducing dropouts.&lt;ref name="Learning to Adapt" /&gt; Other studies cite accelerated learning times with the platform.&lt;ref name="‘Virtual learning’ revolutionising universities"&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald S.|title=‘Virtual learning’ revolutionising universities|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/432338/_virtual_learning_revolutionising_universities/?fp=16&amp;fpid=1|accessdate=March 21, 2013|newspaper=Computerworld Australia|date=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, the platform had become the basis of Australia’s national Biomedical Education Skills and Training Network, and was being integrated into tertiary courses in differing  disciplines at universities in the US and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharma M.|title=Virtual patient gets funding injection|url=http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/government-it/virtual-patient-gets-funding-injection-20120809-23vqf.html|accessdate=March 21, 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SoMS and Smart Sparrow|url=http://medicalsciences.med.unsw.edu.au/news-events/2012/09/soms-and-smart-sparrow|publisher=UNSW School of Medical Sciences|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Sparrow - Case Studies|url=https://www.smartsparrow.com/case-studies/|publisher=Smart Sparrow|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By later that year, Smart Sparrow was being deployed in Australian high schools, as part of a collaborative partnership with Australian universities to improve student engagement in mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Innovation Australia|title=Australian Maths and Science Partnerships Program|url=http://www.innovation.gov.au/highereducation/Funding/AMSPP/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3170">The '''South African Museums Association''' (SAMA), a professional body for museums and museum personnel, was founded at a meeting of museum representatives held in the ‘Chinese Room’, [[Kimberley Public Library]], in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]], on 23 April 1936. Convened by Mr [[C.J. Swierstra]], an entomologist who was director of the [[Transvaal Museum]], it was established to improve and extend a museum service in South Africa; to encourage interaction between kindred institutions and interested persons; and to generate and communicate museological knowledge in the South African context. Twenty two individuals representing 19 institutions were present at the inaugural meeting of the association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sama.za.net/ South African Museums Association]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brain, C.K. &amp; Erasmus, M.C. 1986. ''The making of the museum professions in Southern Africa''. Pretoria: Transvaal Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences and publications==

The association has fulfilled its goals in part through convening regular annual conferences and workshops, held throughout South Africa, with conference papers being made available through its Bulletin, SAMAB, and via less formal communications in national and branch newsletters.

==Provincial branches==

As the association grew, so provincial and local branches were formed, in the Western Cape (1975), Transvaal (1982), Eastern Cape (1982), Kwa-Zulu Natal (1984) and SAMA Central, serving the Free State and Northern Cape (1991). After 1994 further branches were formed in Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and North West Province.

==Regional Role==

SAMA’s geographical scope was sub-continental, not restricted solely to South Africa, with membership open to museum personnel beyond South Africa’s borders. To emphasize this, SAMA officially changed its name to '''Southern African Museums Association''' (1975 to 1995), continuing to make its services accessible to members north of the Limpopo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sama.za.net/ South African Museums Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

The association clashed with the state in the 1980s over the apartheid government’s “general affairs”/”own affairs” policies, which impacted on the administration of museums. SAMA’s stance was strongly affirmed in its 1987 Pietermaritzburg Declaration for South African museums. Concurrently the association embarked on its own process of democratization, amending its constitution in 1990 to strengthen branch representation on council and spelling out its aims to encourage museological research, to promote use of museums, and enhancement of professional training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sama.za.net/ South African Museums Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Class''''' ({{lang-et|Klass}}) is an [[Estonia]]n film about [[school violence]] directed by [[Ilmar Raag]]. It was released on March 16, 2007. A 7 episode series was later produced, telling what happens after the initial movie. The series was called '''''Class: Life After''''' ({{lang-et|Klass: Elu pärast}}, which can also be translated as "Class: Life after").

==Plot==
Joosep Raak ([[Pärt Uusberg]]) is an Estonian teenager who is being [[bullying|bullied]] by his entire high school class, the ring leader of them all is Anders ([[Lauri Pedaja]]), his accomplice Paul (Mikk Mägi) and three other friends Toomas (Joonas Paas), Tiit (Virgo Ernits) and Olav (Karl Sakrits). Anders encourages the class to continually beat up Joosep, and harass him in other ways as well, such as fully undressing him and then pushing him in the girls' changing room. However classmate Kaspar Kordes ([[Vallo Kirs]]) decides to go into a matter of loyalty by going against Anders and the others entertainment of harassing Joosep by defending him, such as giving him a spare pair of shoes when Paul had torn them, which does not sit well with the whole class and so Kaspar becomes separated from the whole group the class had formed. Kaspar's love interest Thea (Paula Solvak) becomes distant to him and this begins to worry him but continues to defend Joosep. 

Joosep's tutor Laine ([[Laine Mägi]]) becomes aware of Joosep receiving harassment and sends Paul to the headmistresses office and so he frames Kaspar of the whole harassment where they believe in him due to being unaware of his true actions, which leads to the school contacting Joosep's parents. Joosep's Father Margus (Margus Prangel) a militarist fascinated with guns and insists on Joosep being a "real man" encounters him about the accusation of Kaspar bullying him and so Joosep dismissively reveals that is the whole class which angers Margus and tells Joosep to fight the ringleader of the crowd as he believes it is the only way to stop and scare somebody from bullying him. The next day when Anders and his four friends go to attack Joosep, the restrained Kaspar breaks free and attempts to hit Anders with a chair, which Anders manages to dodge. Anders then claims that Kaspar has "gone crazy".

Anders asks Kaspar to meet him in the school playground after class. Upon meeting up with an expected fight, Kaspar tells Anders that he will accept the fact that he will not be a "normal guy", where then Paul, Toomas, Tiit and Olav appear with a restrained Joosep and lock Kaspar in a burned down shed where they force him to watch as they take turns to hit Joosep, to the point where he can't breathe anymore. Before leaving off Anders tells Kaspar that if he continues to defend Joosep then it will only earn Joosep worser beatings. Joosep goes to Kaspar's apartment complex where they meet up and he informs Kaspar that he wishes for him to stop defending him, a concerned Kaspar asks what Joosep will do and suggests that he could shoot them by referencing a God's law, Joosep believes that it will be best if he simply let's it go on until he has completely finished school so he will never see them again and be free.

Thea becomes saddened and angered when the class starts believing that in a homophobic atmosphere Joosep and Kaspar are ridiculed for supposedly having gay feelings for each other and so she is having love interests in Kaspar. Kaspar becomes stressed by this and tries to talk Thea down about it but she starts believing that Kaspar cares more about Joosep then her and leaves him, meanwhile Joosep is being beaten in class.

When returning home, Joosep's Mother Liina (Tiina Rebane) discovers heavy bruises on his chest as well as a cut on his chin, she then becomes heavily worried that he had been fighting and demands to know what is happening but he refuses to tell and Margus supports him on the claim. Liina informs the school administration and at last the class as a whole is rightly blamed. When Laine confronts the class about the claim, Joosep runs home fearing the worst and angered, upon entering his home crying only to encounter Margus who learns that Liina called the school, tries to encourage his son to fight back and demonstrates a fighting technique by giving the boy an additional punch. 

Out of revenge, the class assembles on a beach, calling both Kaspar and Joosep there by writing emails to them showing each other as fake sender. Once there, they make Thea confess to Kaspar that she is no longer with him in front of the whole crowd which sets him off and beats Anders to the ground only to have a knife pulled on him, they all then force Kaspar to [[fellatio|fellate]] Joosep at knife point and photograph the sexual act without showing the knife. Kaspar throws up afterwards.

The boys decide to avenge themselves. Joosep steals Margus's two pistols, a bolt-action rifle and ammunition from his gun safe whilst asleep, and the two proceed to school the next morning. As they proceed, students and teachers notice the guns in their hands, when a teacher encounters them about it they simply walk past and Joosep tells her to call the police. Before entering the cafeteria to shoot their bullies, Kerli (Triin Tenso), a gothic girl from the class who also witnessed the incident at the beach, decides to let the two have their revenge and goes past them. They begin the massacre on the students responsible for their torment. Joosep shoots Tiit at close range and then shoots Olav in the head. Joosep then shoots and kills Thea's best friend Riina (Riina Ries). To their regret, Kaspar accidentally shoots an eighth grade female student from another class while trying to shoot Anders. Toomas tries to grab the gun from Joosep but ends up getting shot in the abdomen, then Anders and Paul manage to restrain him and take his rifle, however Kaspar saves Joosep by shooting Paul in the head, just before Anders could reach the exit and escape he is shot in the shoulder and is executed by Joosep. Joosep then goes over to finish off Thea but Kaspar stops him and decides to spare her. Finally Joosep and Kaspar, facing one another, each aim a gun at their own head, decide to commit suicide together after counting to three. Joosep pulls the trigger and dies, but the film ends with Kaspar still standing there with his gun aiming at his head.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7226">''' The University of East Anglia's Creative Writing Course''' was founded by [[Sir Malcolm Bradbury]] and [[Sir Angus Wilson]] in 1970. The M.A. is widely regarded as the most prestigious and successful in the country{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and competition for places is notoriously tough.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The course is split into four strands: [[Prose]], [[Creative Non-Fiction]], [[Poetry]] and [[Scriptwriting]] (which is [[Skillset]] accredited). All four result in an M.A. qualification upon successful completion of the course. The Course Directors are currently [[Andrew Cowan (writer)|Andrew Cowan]], [[Kathryn Hughes]], [[Lavinia Greenlaw]] and [[Val Taylor]] respectively. Course tutors include [[Amit Chaudhuri]], [[Trezza Azzopardi]], [[Giles Foden]], [[Tobias Jones (writer)|Tobias Jones]], [[James Lasdun]], [[Jean McNeil]], [[Margaret Atwood]] and [[George Szirtes]].

Writers such as [[Angela Carter]], [[Rose Tremain]], [[Andrew Motion]], [[W. G. Sebald]], [[Michèle Roberts]] and [[Patricia Duncker]] have also taught on the course.

[[Artist-in-residence|Writers-in-residence]] have included [[Alan Burns (author)|Alan Burns]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://malcolmbradbury.com/uea_ian_mcewan_class.html|title=Class Work|author=[[Ian McEwan]]|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Margaret Attwood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63485">'''University admission''' or '''college admission''' is the process through which students enter [[tertiary education]] at [[universities]] and [[colleges]]. Systems vary widely from country to country, and sometimes from institution to institution. In India almost all top private colleges and universities are having separate seats for management quota. Education diary plays a vital role in [[college]] and [[universities]] admission for all [[Undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] programs.  

In many countries, prospective university students apply for admission during their last year of [[high school]] or [[community college]]. In some countries, there are independent organizations or government agencies to centralize the administration of standardized admission exams and the processing of [[college applications|applications]].

==Australia==
As [[Australia]] uses a [[Federal system]] of government, responsibility for education, and admission to [[TAFE|Technical and Further Education]] colleges and [[undergraduate]] degrees at universities for domestic students, are in the domain of [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] government (see [[Education in Australia]]). All states except Tasmania have centralized processing units for admission to undergraduate degrees for citizens of Australia and [[New Zealand]], and for Australian [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]]; however applications for [[International student|international]] and [[Graduate school|postgraduate]] students are usually accepted by individual universities. The Australian government operates the [[Higher Education Contribution Scheme]] (This has been replaced by the very similar HECS-HELP - Higher Education Loan Program) for undergraduate students, so admission is rarely limited by prospective students' ability to pay up-front. All states use a system that awards the recipient with an [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank|ATAR]], and the award of an [[International Baccalaureate]] meets the minimum requirements for admission in every state. ATARs are awarded based on the level of attainment in each State's individual secondary schooling exams (such as the NSW [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|HSC]]). For individuals without an ATAR, or recent secondary schooling certificate, the [[Special Tertiary Admissions Test]] is used as the standard test to provide an [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank|ATAR]]. The maximum possible ATAR is 99.95, indicating that the student has achieved better than 99.95% of their peers.

===New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory===

The [http://www.uac.edu.au/ Universities Admissions Centre (UAC)] processes applications for admission to most undergraduate courses at [http://www.uac.edu.au/undergraduate/institutions/ participating institutions], mainly in NSW and the ACT.

It also:
* processes applications for admission to many postgraduate courses
* calculates the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) and notifies NSW HSC students of their ATAR
* administers tertiary admissions tests, such as the Special Tertiary Admissions Test (STAT)
* processes applications for Educational Access Schemes (EAS) and for some Equity Scholarships.

===Northern Territory===

The [http://www.satac.edu.au/ South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre] accepts applications for [[Northern Territory]] tertiary institutions. Year 12 students are awarded the '''Northern Territory Certificate of Education''' and must meet course requirements.

===Queensland===

The [http://www.qtac.edu.au/ Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre] accepts applications for [[Queensland]] tertiary institutions. Year 12 students are awarded an [[Overall Position]], based on their performance in class subjects and their school's average result in the [[Queensland Core Skills Test]], as well as meeting course requirements.

===South Australia===

The [http://www.satac.edu.au/ South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre] accepts applications for [[South Australia]]n tertiary institutions. Year 12 students are awarded the [[South Australian Certificate of Education]], and must meet course requirements. Their year 12 results are compared with students from the same year to determine their [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank]].

===Tasmania===

[[Tasmania]]n school leavers applying for entrance at the [[University of Tasmania]] need to apply directly to the university. Tasmanian school students receive a [[Tertiary Entrance Rank]] on successful completion of the [[Tasmanian Certificate of Education]]. Students from interstate wishing to study at UTas may apply through either the [[Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre]], or directly through the University.

===Victoria===

The [http://www.vtac.edu.au/ Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre] accepts applications for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n tertiary institutions. Applications consist of standardized test results and meeting institutional requirements. The standard certification for school-leavers is the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]].

===Western Australia===

The [http://www.tisc.edu.au/ Tertiary Institutions Service Centre] accepts applications for [[Western Australia]]n tertiary institutions. The standardised test for school-leavers is the '''Tertiary Entrance Examination'''.

== Austria, Switzerland, and Belgium ==

[[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Belgium]] probably have the most liberal system of university admission anywhere in the world, since anyone who has passed the [[Matura]] may enroll in any subject field (or even several at no additional cost) at a public university. In [[Belgium]] as well, the only prerequisite for enrolling in university studies is to have obtained a high-school diploma. In both Switzerland and Belgium, medical studies are an exception, which have a numerus clausus system due to overcrowding. This liberal admission practice led to overcrowding and high [[Dropping out|dropout]] rates in the more popular fields of study like psychology and journalism, as well as high failure rates on examinations which are unofficially {{Clarify|date=September 2008}} used to filter out the less-capable students. Following a ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]] issued on July 7, 2005, which forces Austria to accept nationals of other [[European Union|EU]] Member States under the same conditions as students who took their Matura in Austria, a law was passed on June 8 allowing universities to impose measures to select students in those fields which are subject to numerus clausus in Germany. Starting in 2006, the three medical universities (in [[Medical University of Vienna|Vienna]], [[Medical University of Innsbruck|Innsbruck]] and [[Medical University of Graz|Graz]]) did introduce entrance exams. There are no intentions to introduce a numerus clausus in any subject field.

== Brazil ==
{{Main|Universities and higher education in Brazil}}

In order to enter university in Brazil, candidates must undergo a public open examination called "''[[Vestibular]]''", which lasts about 1 week and takes place once a year. Some universities may run Vestibular twice a year, for two yearly intakes instead of only one. This option is popular with private universities, while public universities usually run Vestibular only once every year (in November, December or January). Universities offer a limited number of places, and the best ranked candidates according to their overall Vestibular grade are selected for admission. Although the Vestibular format changes from university to university, it typically consists of a week-long examination on compulsory high school subjects such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, Portuguese language and literature, and a foreign language (usually English). Private universities usually "condense" this week-long examinations into a couple of days, but some public universities still require a week-long marathon.

Since public universities are completely tuition-free, competition at the Vestibular is usually fierce for a place in a public university. Due to high number of applicants, the Vestibular at some public universities may include a preliminary elimination phase (known as "''Primeira Fase''"), typically consisting of multiple-choice questions and held between one and two months before the subject exams. A minimum cutoff score is normally required at the elimination phase to advance to the second part of the Vestibular.

===National Unified Admissions System===

In recent years, university admission criteria have been considerably changed by the introduction by the federal government of a new national secondary school exam known as [[ENEM]] (''Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio'') and the creation of a unified, national university application system known as SISU (''Sistema de Seleção Unificada''). Candidates in any Brazilian state can now apply for admission into courses available in the SISU system, even if the course of interest is offered by an out-of-state university. Places in any given course within the system are then filled based on the ranking of the applicants in descending order according to their overall grade in the ENEM. The application process is divided into three stages and candidates who fail to get a place in their course/university of interest in a given stage may re-apply either to the same or to a different course/university in subsequent stages.

In theory, any Brazilian university, either public or private, is free to join the SISU system and select their incoming freshman class based on ENEM marks. As of today, most public universities have joined SISU, but a few of them, most notably some of the most prestigious federal universities (e.g. [[Federal University of São Paulo|UNIFESP]], [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro|UFRJ]], [[Federal University of Minas Gerais|UFMG]], [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul|UFRGS]]) have retained their own independent Vestibular exams, on top of the national ENEM, either for admission into all or part of their undergraduate courses.

Sometimes the ENEM replaces the old  elimination Part I ("''primeira fase''") of the Vestibular. Alternatively, ENEM results may be used as part of the final overall grade in the Vestibular. More rarely, a few public universities have decided not to use ENEM grades at all and continue to base their admission criteria on the Vestibular only. Notable examples in the latter group include the highly prestigious federal military schools like [[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica|ITA]] and [[Instituto Militar de Engenharia|IME]] and, as of 2010, the prestigious state research universities in the state of São Paulo ([[University of São Paulo|USP]] and [[UNICAMP]]). Resistance to the ENEM among some top public universities comes mostly from the perception that the national federal exam is less selective/rigorous than the older independent Vestibular.

===Admission Quotas===

Another important recent development in university admissions in Brazil has been the introduction in most federal universities of a quota system where a certain number of places are reserved a priori to applicants of a certain racial/ethnic background who have completed their pre-university studies in a public (i.e. state-funded) school. Candidates who qualify may apply to a course of interest under the quota system either through the national SISU system or directly at their university of choice ( in case that university uses both its independent Vestibular and the national ENEM exam to select applicants). Again as a notable exception, the selective federal military schools and the state universities in São Paulo have so far refused to use any quota system based on race or schooling background. USP and UNICAMP, however, have instituted a race-blind "social inclusion program" that gives a bonus in the final Vestibular mgrade to candidates who come from the public secondary schools, thus boosting their chances of securing a place in certain university courses of interest without necessarily using a pre-determined quota.

==Canada==

===Undergraduate entry===
In [[Canada]], students applying from high school generally hear word back from a college or university between late March and late May, though offers of admission may be extended to high achievers (through GPA or other submissions) as early as November–January. Internationals/US applicants are likely to receive an offer or rejection by early April, depending on the original submission of documents. In some cases, an institution may offer admission in a high schoolers [[Educational stages|Grade 11]] year, if monetary fees are sent in early.

====Dual admission====
Many Canadian universities offer dual admission {{clarify|date=August 2013}} to students upon completion of their graduation requirements.

For example, grade 11 and 12 students at [[Columbia International College]] can apply for dual admission at Canadian universities such as [[York University]], [[University of Alberta]], [[Brock University]] and [[Cape Breton University]].

====College vs. University====
Acceptance to a Canadian university or college often requires completion of a [[high school diploma]] (or equivalent). Some colleges or universities accept applicants based on other outcomes, such as the [[General Educational Development]] test, age and life experience, admissions testing, or other criteria.

In Canada, the difference between college and university is significantly different from the typical interpretation in the [[United States]] or even [[United Kingdom]]. A Canadian college is more similar to an American [[community college]]{{citation needed|reason=Dubious claim|date=April 2016}}. In contrast, a [[List of Canadian universities|Canadian university]] is comparable to an American university, and virtually all Canadian [[university|universities]] have endowments over $20 million, most frequently above $100 million. It should be noted that almost all Canadian post-secondary institutions are publicly funded (that is, government subsidized). The few [[Private school|private institutions]] that are not government-supported are not widely known at all, have generally only been established since the 1980s, and are mostly located in [[British Columbia]].

In the [[Education in Canada|Canadian education system]], which varies from [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] to province, colleges are geared for individuals seeking more specific technical careers, such as graphic design or animation whereas universities are geared to individuals seeking more [[academic]] careers where a university degree is a prerequisite for entrance, such as [[medicine]] or [[law]]. There are other systems in place for students to enter [[traditional trades]] (called "skilled trades" in Canada), and some provinces have unique preparatory systems or schools, such as [[Quebec|Quebec's]] pre-university [[College education in Quebec|college]] level.

====Admissions requirements====
Admission to colleges and universities in Canada has been a straightforward process since the 1970s. Students generally rank their chosen institutions in order of preference and submit their transcript to the institution or provincial application service for evaluation. In the majority of cases, acceptance is based entirely on marks, with potential for elevation depending on what province an applicant may be from. Applicants in-province may have less stringent grade requirements than out-of-province applicants. For instance, a student applying from an [[Ontario]] high school to a university in [[Alberta]] or [[Quebec]] is likely to require marginally elevated grades as opposed to applying to any school in [[Ontario]] itself, where universities and colleges may have lower requirements for their own province's high school graduates.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In most cases, Canadian universities require students' high school transcript along with an application for admission. Applications for admission outline additional academic and extra curricular achievements that cannot be expressed through a students' transcript. Generally, universities require that students have taken a university-prep grade 12 [[English studies|English]] course. Additionally, programs involving mathematics and/or natural science often require students to take a university-prep grade 12 [[calculus]] course, as well as university-prep grade 12 [[biology]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]]. Overall, universities base admission around a pupil's academic performance in university/advanced level courses in their grade 11 and 12 years. Also, most universities establish GPA cut offs for admission. This cut off is established based on the competitiveness of individual programs at specific universities. A more competitive program could have a cut off average of 90 percent or higher, while most prestigious programs maintain cut offs around 80 percent. Universities with more liberal application processes could have admission cut offs as low as 65 percent. Students must take university/advanced level courses in grades 11 and 12 in order to apply for university.

====College====
College requirements vary more significantly, though none have entrance requirements above 85 percent from a Canadian high school. In general though, many colleges (such as [[George Brown College]], and [[Mohawk College]]) accept a very high proportion of students with averages above 70 percent, although they may place no limiting minimum for acceptance, and consequently take students with averages below 60 percent. Unlike universities, colleges do not have admission cut offs and as long as students have a passing average and the necessary courses, they can gain admission to most colleges. Incidentally, even the newest Canadian universities have larger endowments than any Canadian college, with no Canadian college having an endowment above $10 million. See [[List of Canadian universities by endowment]].

In addition, many education systems in [[Canada]] have established different courses with varying intensity in order to curtail to a pupil's desired future. [[Ontario]] has gone the furthest with this idea, establishing two different streams in their secondary education system. The university stream includes courses that will prepare students for future studies at university, while the college stream is more applied and less intense, preparing individuals for the future pursuit of a college degree. Universities require these advanced courses for admission, while colleges will admit pupils from either stream.

====Special cases====
Students with an [[IB Diploma Programme|IB Diploma]] can generally enter either college or university more easily than other Canadian high schoolers, due to the material covered in the program. Like students with [[Advanced Placement Program|AP credits]], they may also clip courses in university with faculty consent.

In the case of more select university programs, and for almost all [[international]] students, an [[essay]], statement of intent or personal statement of experience must be submitted directly to the faculty being applied for. Additionally, [[Recommendation letter|letters of reference]], examples of extracurricular involvement, additional community service endeavours, athletic participation, awards and scholarships won and more may all be required for acceptance to some of Canada's top programs.

====Comparability of admissions====
There is an array of highly competitive programs within Canadian institutions, on par with some mid- to top-tier programs in the United States. Institutions like the [[University of Toronto]], the [[University of British Columbia]], and [[McGill University]] find themselves ranked among the world's top universities. In addition, a large portion (upwards of 30%) of university graduates in Canada continue on to pursue further education beyond an [[undergraduate degree]].

===Post-graduate entry===
Post-graduate schools in Canada are, as with other parts of the world, restricted to universities (i.e. One cannot get a master's degree from a Canadian college). Admission to any post-graduate program in Canada is difficult, with many universities having world-renowned programs, and Canadian graduate schools being the sites for many famous inventions and discoveries.

==Chile==
In Chile university admission as a [[freshman]] are based on the [[Prueba de Selección Universitaria]], PSU, scores and ranking of the applicant. [[Chilean Traditional Universities]] tend to put a strong emphasis on [[Prueba de Selección Universitaria]] while the majority of the private universities use their own test or handle PSU scores in a different way than the Chilean Traditional Universities. Architecture, theatre, psychology and some medical schools do also often give high value to special tests.

==Mainland China==

{{Main|National College Entrance Examination}}

In the [[People's Republic of China]], the National College Entrance Examination (高考, ''gaokao'') is given each summer and required for each student. The exam covers common school topics such as math, language, history, science, etc. Better institutions require higher scores for admittance. The required score also varies by province: students in more competitive provinces, like [[Jiangsu]], need higher scores than students from less competitive areas such as [[Tibet]]. Conversely, wealthier cities have more universities per capita and hence lower university entrance standards than some poorer provinces such as [[Anhui]]. In 2006 for example, the minimum score to enter a key university for applicants from [[Beijing]] is 516 but the minimum score for applicants from [[Henan]] is 591.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=2006年06月19日 15:13 |url=http://gaokao.chsi.com.cn/gkxx/fsx/2006.shtml |title=2006年全国各省市高考录取分数线 |publisher=Gaokao.chsi.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular trend in recent years is for students to forfeit the National College Entrance Examination for Western education programs in order to better prepare them for admissions into US universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/how-chinas-new-love-affair-with-us-private-schools-is-changing-them-both/255154/ |title=How China's New Love Affair with U.S. Private Schools Is Changing Them Both |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
For [[Finland]], ''see [[Numerus clausus#Numerus clausus in Finland|Numerus clausus in Finland]]''

Some fields of study explicitly encourage applicants to judge their chances realistically. For example, a student may apply to only one medical school per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.helsinki.fi/peruskoulutus/docs/opiskelijaksi/hakuopas_2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002143806/http://www.med.helsinki.fi/peruskoulutus/docs/opiskelijaksi/hakuopas_2011.pdf |archivedate=October 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, choosing to apply to the more competitive medical schools is risky, if the student is not sure about their strength.

For [[University of Technology#Finland|universities of technology]], there is a similar, but less strict mechanism. The students gain extra priority points, which may increase their points for the first choice by up to 12.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/fi/admissions/technology/bachelor/dia/ |title=Aalto Game Changers. Muuta maailma. - Aalto-yliopisto |publisher=Studies.aalto.fi |date= |accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a student is admitted to several programs, he can't accept any other than the one with the highest priority.

==Germany==

In [[Germany]] prospective students who have passed the [[Abitur]] may decide freely what subjects to enroll in. Recently, however, in some of the most popular and most desired subject fields students have to pass a certain [[numerus clausus]] &amp;mdash; that is, they cannot enroll unless they have scored a minimum grade point average on their Abitur.

There are two types of higher education institutions in Germany, the universities (including'' [[Technische Hochschule]]n'') and the'' [[Fachhochschule]]n'' ([[Institute of technology#German language areas - Technische Universitäten and Fachhochschulen|polytechnics]]). A prospective student who has passed the Abitur is qualified for admission to every German university, with the exception of very few new degree programs, for which additional entrance examinations were recently introduced. A Fachhochschule, in contrast, often requires the student to complete an [[internship]] to qualify for admission.

There is also a second German school leaving exam, which qualifies prospective students for admission to higher education in Germany, the ''Fachhochschulreife'', often called ''Fachabitur'' in colloquial usage. An internship is already part of the Fachhochschulreife itself, therefore a Fachhochschule requires no additional internship from the student. However, most universities do not accept this qualification for admission. An exception are universities in the German state of [[Hesse]], who accept this qualification since 2004 for admission to [[Bachelor's degree]] courses, but not to the traditional German [[Diplom]] degree courses. But with Fachhochschulreife (university of applied sciences entrance qualification) you can visit any Fachhochschule (university of applied sciences) in Germany. You can see the difference between a University / Technische Hochschule and a Fachoberschule very quickly: A Fachhochschule has often the words "University of Applied Science" next to its name.

==Greece==
In [[Greece]] there are panhellenic examinations (''πανελλήνιες'', ''panelinies'') after a student completes [[likio]].

==Hong Kong==

All public universities in [[Hong Kong]] admit local students under the [[Joint University Programmes Admissions System]] (JUPAS).

===In the old system HKALE===
The major criterion of selection is [[HKALE]] result, and to a smaller extent [[HKCEE]] result and interview performance.

===In the new system HKDSE===
The major criterion of selection is HKDSE result. To a smaller extent interview performances and to an even smaller extent secondary school performances.

==Iceland==
Both public and private [[List of universities in Iceland|universities in Iceland]] handle their own admissions. Students apply for a specific [[course of study]] and each programme has its own requirements. These are usually a [[matriculation exam]] but sometimes a minimum number of credits in certain subjects in [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] or even passing an entry test is needed. Foreign students must apply half a year prior to the first semester but the time limit for Nordic citizens is not as strict.

==India==

Most [[India]]n universities participate in one or another centralized admission procedure. In summer 2011, an Indian institution was expecting 100% score for gaining admission, highlighting the crisis of confidence in quality of higher education in general and also limitations of admissions process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreducation.com/2011/06/indian-university-admissions-crisis-of.html |title=Indian University Admissions: The Crisis of Confidence in Quality |publisher=DrEducation.com |date=2011-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 National tests and interviews are organized by an independent body composed of members of the participating organizations. Little weight is given to applicants’ past academic record and more to their exam results. Applicants are ranked by exam grades, and submit their preference of universities/programs based on their rank and choice. Some such common entrance tests are:
* Joint Entrance Exam (JEE), the undergraduate exam for the sixteen [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs);
*  Common Admission Test (CAT), XAT, JMAT, MAT or SNAP, the graduate exams for the [[Indian Institutes of Management]] (IIMs) and other business schools;
* Graduate Admission Test of Engineering (GATE), the graduate exam for the IITs;
* All India Engineering Entrance Exam (AIEEE) for admission to Undergraduate Engineering and Architecture / Design courses;
* Pre Medical Test (PMT)-conducted by the CBSE; the entrance exam for admission to MBBS program;
* Bachelor's degree Admission in [http://bhartiojas.com/b-ed-2017/ General Stream] 

However, Things have now changed and the AIEEE is converted into JEE (MAIN). And the earlier JEE for IITs has converted into JEE (Advanced).
All students first have to qualify JEE (MAIN) to be able to appear in JEE (Advanced) under certain criterion.
Students need to be in the 20 percentile of their respective boards. Their score of JEE (MAIN) will be formulated by combining the 40% score of their BOARD Examination and 60% of their JEE (MAIN) paper's score.
Only the pure JEE (ADVANCED) score will be considered for selection in IITs.
JEE (Main) will be on the same pattern as earlier AIEEE.
JEE (ADVANCED) will be on the same pattern as earlier JEE.
Changes in system take place from 2012.

States have their own admissions exams and policies. For example, the state of Maharashtra uses the HSC test as a prerequisite for entering Degree level college and uses the SSC test as a prerequisite for entering Junior Level college as well as Diploma Level College. Apart from that 15% reserved for  NRI / Foreign students.
Recently the medical exam known as PMT was dropped with introduction of a nationalised exam known as NEET.

==Indonesia==
In [[Indonesia]], University and College Admission is dependent on the University or College Status. Generally, Public Universities conduct their admission in unified system of two as of 2017. Public Nationwide admissions to Public universities are subsidied by the government and students who succeed to enter university from one of the two schemes will enjoy lower to free university program fees. The first alternative is SNMPTN (Seleksi Nasional Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri-Unified National Public Universities Admission). SNMPTN is a university admission scheme based on academic performances during the years of Senior High School. This selection system is designed only for students graduating during that respective year only. SNMPTN selection considers a few criteria such as student's academic grades and performances, achievements, stream or type of class (sciene or social, AP or Regular) and originating high school. However, not all senior students can apply, usually only 50% of the graduating class may apply for an 'A' accredited school and lower quotas for other accreditations. According to the law of the Ministry of Higher Education, the total holding admission into a public university  should at least be 30% from SNMPTN; each university may allocate more. The second alternative is SBMPTN (Seleksi Bersama Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri-Unified Public Universities Admission Examination). SBMPTN is a university admission where you take two or three tests (aptitude test, natural science test, and/or social science test), applicants will also be required to submit into a practical session if the chosen major is art, music, or physical education. You also choose 3 different majors and/or universities. This examination is held nationwide once a year and unlike SNMPTN, is open to high school graduates of the last 3 years. Many students repeat or take gap years to retake the SBMPTN to get into their wanted university. According to the Ministry of Higher Education, minimum 30% of the entire public university quota should admit from SBMPTN. However, most public universities allocate 60% and above for SBMPTN due to the constantly high success rate of students who were accepted from this scheme. SBMPTN is known for its very difficult questions and challenging time-management difficulties. The exam is also held CBT (Computer-Based) starting of last year. Most universities are conducting independent selection mechanism on their own beside SNMPTN and SBMPTN such as SIMAK or PPKB from Universitas Indonesia or UTUL from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM). These are called special programs as they tend to be more expensive due to the incentive that these programs are not under government subsidies. Meanwhile, Private Universities usually do their admission before and after Public Universities Admission. They sometimes do several admissions. Governmental Agency Institutions does their admission independently (not included in Unified National Public Universities Admission) and will usually have their own scheme for selection.

==Ireland==
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], students in their final year of secondary education apply to the [[Central Applications Office]], listing several courses at any of the third-level institutions in order of preference. Students then receive points based on their [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]], and places on courses are offered to those who applied who received the highest points.

==Israel==
In [[Israel]] there is a test called The [[Psychometric Entrance Test]] (PET). The PET covers three areas: mathematics, verbal reasoning and the English language. It is administered by the Israeli National Institute for Testing and Evaluation (NITE). University admissions are typically based on a weighted average (the "mit'am") of the PET score and the GPA of the [[Bagrut]] (High School Completion Examination). In addition, some programs in science and engineering require that the applicant's bagrut includes the maximum number of units ("5 units") for mathematics.

Some programs have two cutoffs for the mit'am, a higher one for "guaranteed admission" and a lower one for "automatic rejection". Mit'am scores between the two cutoffs may be admitted on a space-available basis.

==Palestine==

In [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] there is a National Center for Examinations and Evaluation.

In Palestine, students are required to undergo the Tawjihi examinations, which then allow the universities (In the West Bank) to consider each pupil.

==Japan==
In [[Japan]], there are at least three methods for controlling university admissions: the AO method (involving recommendation letters for students who have performed reasonably well and have shown commitment and skill in relation to sports or other extracurricular activities), a centralised multiple choice examination known as the [[National Center Test for University Admissions]], and entrance examinations set by each of the universities. A combination of methods may also be used. For public universities, the Center Test is often used as an initial filtering stage to determine eligibility to take the more difficult examinations set by each individual university. Public national universities usually require candidates to sit examinations across a wide range of subjects, whilst private ones allow a focus on arts and humanities or sciences, reducing the burden of preparation. However, public national universities are popular due to prestige and lower fees, although some private universities are more prestigious than certain public national universities. There is usually no limit on the number of colleges to which a student may apply but public national universities tend to hold their examinations on one of two days, which means that students must in practice choose two preferred public national universities and also correctly estimate their own ability to avoid picking a university examination that is too difficult or that is too easy. To assist with this, private companies run a number of mock examinations throughout the year, enabling candidates to gauge where they rank in comparison to other candidates nationwide. Based on this they will decide which examinations they should realistically be able to attempt. Reforms are to be inplemented to the Center examination in future, with extended answer questions being introduced in addition to multiple choice questions, and with official internationally recognised standardised tests in English being used to replace individual university exams in English.

==Korea==
In [[Korea]] there is national center for test which happens every year around November called su-neung. Many student prepares this test from beginning of middle school throughout their highschool. Very big thing in Korea, and you can choose which subject you are taking the test for.

==Malta==

In [[Malta]] entrance is done after performing well in examinations which are a local version equivalent to the [[General Certificate of Education]].

==Netherlands==

In the [[Netherlands]], prospective students have to choose, two years before graduation, for a graduation type (e.g. natural science graduation type). Subjects at Dutch universities freely accept all students who have chosen the correct graduation type (e.g. to enroll in physics, the graduation type 'natural sciences' is required). All other students have to pass an exam to be enrolled (this is the exception). Popular subjects, such as [[medicine]] or [[dental medicine]] have a [[numerus fixus]], meaning that a limited number of students may enroll for this subject at a particular university. To decide who is allowed, a lottery is held in which ones grades influence chances of being chosen (an indirect and incomplete [[numerus clausus]]).

==Nigeria==
In [[Nigeria]], undergraduate admissions into universities, polytechnics, monotechnics, and colleges of education and agriculture is administered by a centralized federal government agency known as the [[Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board]], [[JAMB]]. The body conducts '''Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME)''' for prospective university, polytechnics, monotechnics, and colleges of education and agriculture students seeking entrance into tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Students who obtain the minimum cut off mark of 180 in the JAMB_UME are invited by their institution of choice for a second entrance examination called the Post-UTME aptitude test which is conducted by individual tertiary institutions.

==Norway==
In [[Norway]] candidates are admitted to entry-level programs through the [[Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service]], that ranks qualified students based on a point scheme, that is based on grades and the degree of specialization and choice of study at upper secondary school, as well as age. At Master level admission is based on the grade average at the Bachelor level.

== Pakistan ==

In [[Pakistan]], [[public university|public]] and [[private university|private]] universities hold entrance tests for admission in [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] degrees either conducted by the university itself or by [[National Testing Service|NTS]]. The [[Quota System in Pakistan]] is also used to give preference to students from backward areas.

For admission in engineering and medical degrees, [[ECAT Pakistan|ECAT]] and [[MCAT Pakistan|MDCAT]] are taken respectively. The appearance in these exams is mandatory for every student to pursue his degree in these disciplines in public sector universities.

==Portugal==
In [[Portugal]] admission to higher education level studies requires the secondary school credential, ''Diploma de Ensino Secundário'', which is achieved after completing the first twelve study years. Students must have studied the subjects for which they are entering to be prepared for the entrance exams. Also they are required to be previously specialised in a specific area at the secondary school, one of the following four: Science and Technologies, Economics, Languages or Arts. Students sit for one or more entrance exams, ''Concurso nacional'' for public institutions or ''Concurso local'' for private institutions. In addition to passing entrance exams, students must fulfil particular prerequisites for the chosen course. Enrollment is limited; each year the institution establishes the number of places available. For the public institutions the exam scores count for the final evaluation, which includes the secondary school average marks. Then the students have to choose six institutions/courses they prefer to attend, in preferential order. The ones, who reach the marks needed to attend the desired institution/course, given the attributed vacant, will be admitted. Some public [[university]] courses demands generally higher admission marks than most similar courses at some [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnical]] institutes or private institutions. (''see also [[Education in Portugal]]'')

==Russia==
Traditionally, the universities and institutes conducted their own admissions tests regardless of the applicants' school record. There were no uniform measure of graduates' abilities; marks issued by high schools were perceived as incompatible due to grading variances between schools and regions. In 2003 the Ministry of Education launched the [[Unified state examination]] (USE) program. The set of standardized tests for high school graduates, issued uniformly throughout the country and rated independent of the student's schoolmasters, akin to North American [[SAT]], was supposed to replace entrance exams to state universities. Thus, the reformers reasoned, the USE will empower talented graduates from remote locations to compete for admissions at the universities of their choice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.rian.ru/onlinenews/20041118/39773648.html | title=Unified state examination still in debate | year=2004 | publisher=RIA Novosti, November 11, 2004 | language=English, Russian | accessdate=2008-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time eliminating admission-related bribery, then estimated at 1 billion US dollars annually. In 2003, 858 university and college workers were indicted for bribery, admission "fee" in [[MGIMO]] allegedly reached 30,000 US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rg.ru/2004/08/18/korruptsia.html | title=Priyomnaya komissiya - $ 30.00(''Приемная комиссия - $ 30.000'') | author=Kartashova, Larisa| publisher=Rossiyskaya gazeta, August 18, 2004 | language=Russian |accessdate=2008-10-08 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University heads, notably [[Moscow State University]] rector [[Viktor Sadovnichiy]], resisted the novelty, arguing that their schools cannot survive without charging the applicants with their own entrance hurdles. Nevertheless, the legislators enacted USE in February 2007. In 2008 it was mandatory for the students and optional for the universities; it is fully mandatory since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20070126/59727252.html | title=Russia makes stride in education reform | year=2007 | publisher=RIA Novosti, January 26, 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few higher education establishments are still allowed to introduce their own entrance tests in addition to USE scoring; such tests must be publicized in advance.(''see also [[Education in Russia]]'')

==Saudi Arabia==
Admission to colleges in Saudi Arabia depends on the high school grade as well as the scores of some standardized tests called '''[[Qiyas Tests]]''' prepared by ''the National Center for Assessment in Higher Education''.

==Sweden==
Admission in [[Sweden]] requires completion of secondary education, along with the proper specific qualifications (e.g. science in high school to study science in college).  Prospective students are admitted based on their grade point average or SAT, although majors such as theatre and architecture may require some extra work.

== Thailand ==

In general, [[Thailand]] uses the centralized admission system. In this system, student hoping to finish secondary school or its equivalent is expected to sit many examinations. The one required for nearly all universities is the Ordinary National Education Test (O-NET) aiming to test basic knowledge across the following subjects required under the Thai law:
* Thai Language and Literature
* English Language
* Mathematics
* Comprehensive Sciences
* Social Studies
* Health Education
* Arts and Culture
Students then may use the O-NET test score to apply to particular university through the direct admission system by taking tests conducted by particular university. However, most students still use the centralized admission system. In this system, they are expected to take another two [[aptitude tests]], aiming at testing their ability to succeed in university. The first one is General Aptitude Test (GAT). GAT tests the reasoning ability and English proficiency of the candidates. It asks students to link and identity relationships between events. The English section is comparable to the TOEFL test, but is completely objective in nature. Both O-NET and GAT examinations are scored by computer.

The second examination is the Professional Aptitude Test (PAT). Students may choose to take the tests that are required by the program they are applying to. Therefore, they don't have to take all tests like the O-NET. The subjects offered are as follow:
* Advanced [[Mathematics]], testing students ability in discrete mathematics, pure mathematics, and descriptive mathematics, including Calculus and Statistics. The test is completely objective, consisting of multiple choices and student-produced response.
* Sciences. It is divided into three section, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Students must take all sections. The test is completely objective. It contains mostly multiple choices question but sometimes student-produced response as well.
* Engineering Aptitude. It tests candidates' ability in Physics and Chemistry as well as their ability to apply their knowledge. The test is completely objective, consisting of multiple choices and student-produced response.
* Architecture Aptitude. It tests candidates's ability in non-numerical Physics and aptitude in basic arts and design. There are questions that ask students to design a room with furnitures given. These questions are completely objective and are scored by computer. The test contains a subjective section, testing candidates' ability to sketch and draw
* Education-specific Professional Aptitude. It tests students' moral standard and ability to work with students as teacher.
* Fine and Applied Arts. It tests candidates' knowledge in the visual art, music theory, performance arts.
* Languages. As English is already tests in GAT, PAT tests candidates' ability in other modern languages. Candidates can choose from [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Arabic]], and [[Pali]].

The students are responsible to report all scores to the central admission system. They are required to choose a program or faculty that they want to study in. After that, different mathematical formula is used to weighed students' scores for that program. For instance, Pharmacology requires high scores on Sciences, while Economics requires high score in Mathematics. After the score is weighed, students are offered decision only according to their scores. Some exception might occur in program, such fine and applied arts as students are required to submit portfolio for consideration.

The only exception to centralized admission system and direct admission system is Medicine and Dentistry, which have their own admission system. Students will need to take the following tests to be eligible for consideration:
* Mathematics
* Thai Language and Literature
* English
* Physics
* Chemistry
* Biology
* Social Studies
* Medicine and Dentistry-specific Aptitude Test. This tests include a hard form of reasoning tests as in first part of GAT. It also includes tests of Ethics and reading analysis and synthesis. In Ethics section, students are asked to choose 3 most "ethical" decision based on the situation described. In reading synthesis section, they are given time to read an article, then article is taken away. They are asked to answer multiple choices question on the passage.

Students' scores are also weighed, and admission decision is made accordingly.

== Turkey ==
{{Main|Education in Turkey}}
In [[Turkey]], the ''Student Selection and Placement Center'' [[ÖSYM]] is the responsible body for organizing [[ÖSS]], the national level university admission examination.

== United Kingdom ==
{{See also|UCAS}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] there are separate admission processes for undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.  There is also [[The Open University]] which has an ''open door policy''.

===Undergraduate entry===

====The application process====
The United Kingdom has a centralised system of admissions to higher education at undergraduate level, [[UCAS]]. In general, students are not admitted to universities and colleges as a whole, but to particular [[Course of study|courses of study]].

During the first few months (September to December) of the final year of school or sixth form college (age 17/18) or after having left school, applicants register on the UCAS website and select five courses at higher education institutes (fewer choices are permitted for the more competitive subjects such as medicine and veterinary medicine). If the applicant is still at school, his or her teachers will give him or her predicted grades for their A-level, Highers or IB subjects, which are then used for the application. If the applicant has already left school, he or she applies with results already obtained.  The applicant must provide a personal statement describing in their own words why they want to study that particular subject and why they would be a committed student,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/students/startapplication/apply09/personalstatement/ |title=How to Apply - 2009 - Your personal statement |publisher=[[UCAS]] |accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their school must provide an academic reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/students/applying/howtoapply/reference |title=UCAS - Your reference |publisher=[[UCAS]] |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some universities (e.g. [[Oxford]], [[Cambridge]], [[Manchester]], [[Imperial College]], [[King's College London]] or [[University College London]]) and some disciplines (e.g. medicine) routinely require shortlisted candidates to attend an interview and/or complete special admissions tests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/students/beforeyouapply/admissions/ |title=Admissions Tests |publisher=[[UCAS]] |accessdate=2009-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314071128/http://www.ucas.com/students/beforeyouapply/admissions/ |archivedate=2009-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; before deciding whether to make an offer.  In the absence of tests and interviews, the personal statement and reference can be decisive, as many students are likely to apply to competitive courses with similar predicted and actual grades.

In general, applications must be received mid-January for courses that start the following Autumn.  However the deadline is three months earlier, in mid-October, where the application includes a medical, dentistry or veterinary course, or any course at [[Oxbridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCAS Students: Important dates for your diary |quote=15 October 2008 Last date for receipt of applications to Oxford University, University of Cambridge and courses in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science or veterinary medicine. |url=http://www.ucas.com/students/importantdates |accessdate=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each course applied for, the applicant receives a response from the institution: rejection, conditional offer or unconditional offer. If a conditional offer is received, the student can only take up the place on the course if they later fulfil the stated conditions: normally the achievement of specific grades in their forthcoming exams. If no offers are received following the initial application, or the applicant does not wish to take up any of their offers,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} UCAS+ can be used. Applicants can then apply to one course at a time in order to try to find a suitable offer.

Following the receipt of offers, whether after the initial application, or through UCAS+, the applicant chooses two courses for which offers have been made: a first choice and a second choice. If the conditions of the first choice offer are later met, the applicant may attend this course. If the applicant does not fulfil the conditions of their first choice, but does fulfil the conditions of their second "insurance" choice, they can attend their second choice course. If they fail to meet the conditions of both offers, they may choose to go through "clearing". This involves ringing up or sending their application to different universities in the hope of finding a place on another course. Many students do successfully find places through this route.

====Factors affecting admission====
Whether to admit an applicant to a course is entirely the decision of each individual university. They will base their decision on a variety of factors, but primarily the grades predicted or already received in school leaver examinations. As more and more applicants are attaining higher and higher grades in the A level examinations, most universities also use secondary admissions criteria. These may include results at GCSE or Standard grade examinations (or equivalent), the references provided on the application and the information provided on the personal statement. The personal statement can often be the deciding factor between two similar candidates so a small industry has sprung up offering false personal statements for a fee. UCAS uses "similarity detection" software to detect personal statements that have been written by third parties or [[Plagiarism|copied from other sources]], and universities can reject applications for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucas.ac.uk/students/startapplication/apply09/faqs/personalstatement/similaritydetection |title=Questions about the UCAS Similarity Detection Service |publisher=[[UCAS]] |accessdate=2009-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001144447/http://www.ucas.ac.uk/students/startapplication/apply09/faqs/personalstatement/similaritydetection |archivedate=October 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal statements generally describe why the applicant wants to study the subject they have applied for, what makes them suitable to study that subject, what makes them suitable to study at degree level generally, any work experience they have gained, their extracurricular activities and any other factors. This is the only way admissions tutors can normally get an impression of what a candidate is really like and assess the applicant's commitment to the subject.

In addition to the information provided on the UCAS form, some universities ask candidates to attend an interview. Oxford and Cambridge almost always interview applicants, unless, based on the UCAS form and/or admissions tests, they do not believe the applicant has any chance of admission. Other universities may choose to interview, though only in some subjects and on a much smaller scale, having already filtered out the majority of candidates. The interview gives the admissions tutors another chance to assess the candidate's suitability for the course.

Universities are increasingly being put under pressure from central Government to admit people from a wider range of social backgrounds. Social background can only be assessed by the type of school attended, as no information about income or background is otherwise required on the UCAS form.

Another important determinant of whether an offer is to be made is the amount of competition for admission to that course. The more competitive the course, the less likely an offer will be made and, therefore, the stronger the application must be. Applicants for medicine are often expected to have undertaken extensive work experience in a relevant field in order to show their commitment to the course. For the most competitive courses, less than 10% of applications may result in admission, whereas at the less competitive universities, practically all applicants may receive an offer of admission.

Ultimately, however, no matter how many extra-curricular activities and work experience have been undertaken, if the admissions tutor does not believe, based on the submitted exam results, the candidate is academically capable of completing the course, he or she will not be admitted.

A well qualified candidate applying under UCAS for five competitive courses to each of which only 10% of well qualified candidates could be accepted would have only a 40% chance of receiving at least one offer of acceptance.
Alternatively, if five less competitive courses each having a 33% acceptance rate are chosen, the chance of receiving at least one offer is more than 85%.
This implies that a strategy for improving the chance of receiving at least one offer, to perhaps 70%, is indicated even to well qualified candidates.
It is right to know that in order to get admitted in a university in the United Kingdom, admission tests are not identified as the most important as the main factors that determine a college admission. Surveys show that strong grades in college-prep classes are important factors that can help you get in universities in easier way.

===Postgraduate entry===
All applications are made directly to the university or college, with no limit on the number of courses that can be applied for.

==United States==
{{Main|College admissions in the United States}}

In the [[United States of America]], [[high school]] students apply to four-year [[College|colleges]] and [[universities]], where [[undergraduate]] students may earn a [[Bachelor's degree]]. Others attend [[community college]]s or a two-year institution. These students may acquire a technical degree, a two-year [[Associate degree]], and/or prepare for transfer to four-year institutions. [[Non-traditional student]]s are usually students over the age of 22 who pursue studies in [[higher education]]. Students may apply to many institutions using the [[Common Application]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonapp.org|title=Welcome|last=ISDeveloper|date=2015-06-17|website=The Common Application|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2015-2016 the common application only offered applications to 644 of the United States 3,039 four year colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8T7VG8uKGE0RGc0VEk2WWFXSGc/view|title=CommonAppSchools.State2016.pdf|work=Google Docs|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=84|title=The NCES Fast Facts Tool provides quick answers to many education questions (National Center for Education Statistics)|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this an average of 94% of students applied online for the fall of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Clinedinst,Melissa, Koranteng, Anna-Maria, Nicola, Tara [https://www.nacacnet.org/globalassets/documents/publications/research/2015soca.pdf "State of College Admission"] National Association for College Admission Counseling. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;There is no limit to the number of colleges or universities to which a student may apply, though an application must be submitted for each. Fees are generally charged for each admissions application, but can be waived based on financial need. 

Students apply to one or more colleges or universities by submitting an application which each college evaluates using its own criteria. The college then decides whether or not to extend an offer of admission (and possibly [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]]) to the student. The majority of colleges admit students to the college as a whole, and not to a particular [[academic major]], although this may not be the case in some specialized programs such as [[engineering]] and [[architecture]] and maybe more impacted in certain majors. The system is decentralized: each college has its own criteria for admission, even when using a common application form. 

Common criteria include [[ACT (test)|ACT]] or [[SAT]] scores, extracurricular activities, [[Grade point average|GPA]], demonstrated integrity, and a general college [[admissions essay]]. Further criteria, used to varying degrees, include athletic ability, interest the student demonstrates in the college, [[legacy preferences]] (family members having attended the school), race, ability to pay full tuition, potential to donate money to the school ([[development case]]), desired class composition (especially diversity, which includes racial diversity, geographical and national diversity, and diversity of interests in the class), perceived fit, subjective evaluation of student character (based on essays or interviews), and general discretion by the admissions office. The importance of the various factors varies between universities, and selectiveness varies significantly, as measured by admissions rate (which depends both on selectiveness and number and type of applicants). The admissions rate can range from 100% (schools that accept everyone with a high school diploma) to under 10%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5477">The '''Virtual Student Federal Service''' ('''VSFS'''), formerly known as the '''Virtual Student Foreign Service,''' is a [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] program that offers opportunities for American college and university students to [[Virtual internship|virtually intern]] at U.S. federal agencies. There are over 500 opportunities available at 33 federal agencies, and many of the opportunities are looking for more than one intern.  Interns can be enrolled in a class or classes at any tertiary institution, but they must be American citizens. All work is virtual, and background clearances are not required. These opportunities are unpaid, but offer real work experience, sometimes involving foreign languages.

== History ==
The Virtual Student Federal Service was announced by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] in May 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2009a/05/123431.htm|title=Remarks at the New York University Commencement Ceremony, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State|last=|first=|date=2009-05-13|website=Office of Website Management, Bureau of Public Affairs|publisher=U.S. Department of State|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as one of several programs in Clinton’s 21st Century Statecraft initiative.  Twenty-first Century Statecraft is defined as, “[t]he complementing of traditional foreign policy tools with newly innovated and adapted instruments of statecraft that fully leverage the networks, technologies, and demographics of our interconnected world.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21st Century Statecraft|url=https://www.state.gov/statecraft/overview/index.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VSFS partners with U.S. diplomatic posts overseas and State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), NASA, and many other federal agencies to provide virtual internship opportunities.

The first virtual internship year coincided with the 2009–2010 academic year.

==Program details==
Internships begin in the Fall and end in the Spring, with an application open period in July. Students commit for the [[Year#Academic_year|academic year]], contributing 10 hours a week for the virtual internship. Students communicate with their supervisors often through [[email]], [[telephone]], and [[Skype]]. The nature of work varies depending on what the agency needs. The work may be research-based, where the student is required to contribute to reports on issues such as [[economics]], the [[Environmental science|environment]], and [[human rights]], or the work may be technology-focused, such as creating [[blog]]s and producing electronic journals.  Language skills are sometimes required.

==== Examples of projects (from 2017–2018): ====
[[United States Department of State]]: Help build a successful partnership among Department of State bureaus and offices to improve the way employees worldwide use data and knowledge to accomplish their missions.

[[United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development (USAID)]]: Help connect, support, and promote the work of the Higher Education Solutions Network (HESN) at USAID, a global network of universities that harnesses science, technology, and innovation to solve development challenges.

[[Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]]: We seek an intern who can assist in identifying best practices from academia (e.g. cognitive/behavioral science, business/management theory), government, and the private sector so that we may apply this research toward internal programs.

[[Smithsonian Institution]]: Help millions of National Zoo visitors plan their visits by designing and building a cutting edge "plan your day" tool.

[[National Park Service]]: Display and interpret three large fossil specimens in a permanent Visitor Center installation. This project will include designing an interpretive panel, sign or wall display that tells the story of these fossils, while offering the visitor with some context for the significance of these artifacts.

[[United States Department of Defense]]: Analyze open-source online data to map and draw conclusions on insurgent activity and international force response in conflict areas in Africa.

[[NASA]]: Facilitate agency-wide virtual events and teach employees how to effectively use multimedia platforms; additionally, you will be responsible for coaching NASA employees on the logistics of running a virtual event.

==Application process==
The competitive process starts with students applying  through the [[USAJOBS|USAJobs.gov website]]. In the application, students may choose from a list of available projects, selecting three in their order of preference. e-Interns must be [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12083">'''Wolff-Michael Roth''' (Born June 28, 1953, Heidelberg) is a [[learning sciences|learning scientist]] at the [[University of Victoria]] conducting research on how people across the life span know and learn mathematics and science. He has contributed to numerous fields of research: learning science in [[learning communities]], coteaching, authentic school [[science education]], cultural-historical [[activity theory]], social studies of science, [[gesture]] studies, [[qualitative research]] methods, [[embodied cognition]], [[situated cognition]], and the role of language in learning science and mathematics.

==Career==
Roth received a master's degree of physics&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, K., Hink, W., &amp; Roth, W.-M. (1980). Stopping power for H+ in Be (20-120 keV). ''Nuclear Instruments and Methods, 173'', 357-362.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of Wuerzburg]] and completed a doctorate in the College of Science and Technology at the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] ([[Hattiesburg]], [[Mississippi]]) with concentrations in cognition, statistics, and physical chemistry. He began to establish himself as a researcher while teaching at [[Appleby College]] ([[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]], [[Ontario]]). There, he did the research for what became one of the first research articles on the social construction of knowledge in science classrooms: "The social construction of scientific concepts or The concept map as conscription device and tool for social thinking in high school science."&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; Roychoudhury, A. (1992). The social construction of scientific concepts or The concept map as conscription device and tool for social thinking in high school science. ''Science Education, 76'', 531-557.&lt;/ref&gt; There he also conducted the work that would lead to ''Authentic School Science'',&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (1995). ''Authentic school science: Knowing and learning in open-inquiry science laboratories''. Dordrecht, Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; in which he provides evidence for how high school students learn science when provided with opportunities to frame their own research questions, which they then answer by designing and conducting experiments. They write up their results, which they have to be able to defend within their [[learning community]]. In 1992, he joined [[Simon Fraser University]] ([[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]]), where he was mainly responsible for teaching statistics in the Faculty of Education. In his research, he initially focused on learning in science classrooms, but soon expanded his work to learning mathematics and science among future teachers, research scientists, and designers of computer software. In 1997, he was appointed ''Lansdowne Professor of Applied Cognitive Science'' at the [[University of Victoria]]. There he further expanded his research on the learning of mathematics and science, for example, on the use of graphs in scientific research and in technical professions.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2003). ''Toward an anthropology of graphing: Semiotic and activity-theoretic perspectives''. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Contributions==
Although he worked within a neo-Piagetian (information processing oriented) paradigm during his doctoral research, using statistical methods, his subsequent work was initially based in school science classrooms and later extended to mathematics and science in fish hatcheries,&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2005). Mathematical inscriptions and the reflexive elaboration of understanding: An ethnography of graphing and numeracy in a fish hatchery. ''Mathematical Thinking and Learning, 7'', 75-109.&lt;/ref&gt; environmental activism,&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, L., &amp; Roth, W.-M. (2006). Learning and teaching as emergent features of informal settings: An ethnographic study in an environmental action group. ''Science Education, 90'', 1028-1049.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S., &amp; Roth, W.-M. (2001). How ditch and drain become a healthy creek: Representations, translations and agency during the re/design of a watershed. Social Studies of Science, 31, 315-356.&lt;/ref&gt; field ecology,&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2005). Making classifications (at) work: Ordering practices in science. ''Social Studies of Science, 35'', 581-621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; Bowen, G. M. (1999). Digitizing lizards or the topology of vision in ecological fieldwork.

Responsibility in dental practice: An activity theoretical practice. ''Journal of Workplace Learning, 19'', 240-255.&lt;/ref&gt; water technicians,&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2007).

Tolchinsky (Eds.), ''Notational knowledge: Historical and developmental perspectives'' (pp. 179-207). Rotterdam/Taipei: Sense.&lt;/ref&gt; construction sites, and in local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2008). Constructing community health and safety. ''Municipal Engineer, 161'', 83-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., Riecken, J., Pozzer, L. L., McMillan, R., Storr, B., Tait, D., Bradshaw, G. &amp; Pauluth Penner, T. (2004). Those who get hurt aren't always being heard: Scientist-resident interactions over community water. ''Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 29'' (2), 153-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphing as Social Practice===
Psychologist tend to theorize graphing, as all other forms of representing activity, as a faculty of the mind. Based on his ethnographic studies of mathematics among scientists, Roth proposes to view graphing as a social practice that humans learn ''in relation with others''; the relation ''is'' what we subsequently attribute to the mind. Because graphing is a ''social'' fact, it can be studied using anthropological methods, which is precisely what Roth proposes in ''Towards an Anthropology of Graphing''&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2003). ''Toward an anthropology of graphing: Semiotic and activity-theoretic perspectives''. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a comprehensive review of the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; McGinn, M. K. (1998). Inscriptions: a social practice approach to "representations." ''Review of Educational Research, 68'', 35-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gesture Studies===
[[Gesture]]s constitute an integral aspect of knowing and learning. Arising from his studies of learning in high school science laboratories and hands-on elementary school activities, Roth showed how students' scientific knowledge arises from what initially are simply manipulative movements and hand movements to explore and learn about the natural world. These movements later become symbolic movements, that is, gestures, which encode the earliest forms of knowing that can be observed prior to verbal forms.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; Lawless, D. (2002). Signs, deixis, and the emergence of scientific explanations. Semiotica, 138, 95-130.&lt;/ref&gt; In the main review journal of educational research he published a summary of the work in psychology, anthropology, and linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2002). Gestures: Their role in teaching and learning. ''Review of Educational Research, 71'', 365-392.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coteaching===
Whereas in many professions, practitioner learn while working with others, teachers have to figure out much of their knowledge on their own. Using it initially as a form of staff development, Roth, subsequently working with Ken Tobin, developed coteaching as a form learning to teach while teaching. Together they published ''At the Elbow of Another'',&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; Tobin, K. (2002). ''At the elbow of another: Learning to teach by coteaching''. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they lay out the foundation of this approach. In this model, supervision and evaluation of teaching and research on teaching have to be conducted by teaching together with the resident teachers.

===Cultural-Historical Activity Theory===
Roth has contributed to this field especially by theorizing school-related processes in terms of a version of this theory that was popularized in the Center for Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research. He proposed a fourth generation of this theory, which takes into account emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2007). Emotion at work: A contribution to third-generation cultural historical activity theory. Mind, Culture and Activity, 14, 40-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Yew Jin Lee, he wrote a review of the literature on this "neglected legacy" of the work of [[Vygotsky|Lev S. Vygotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; Lee, Y. J. (2007). "Vygotsky's neglected legacy": Cultural-historical activity theory. Review of Educational Research, 77, 186-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowing in the Flesh===
Most recently, Roth has been working on questions of [[embodied cognition]], which is in fact a misnomer, for all cognition inherently is embodied.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets-Johnstone, M. (2009). The corporeal turn: An interdisciplinary reader. Exeter, England: Imprint Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the French philosophers [[Maine de Biran]] and [[Michel Henry]] he conceives of the emergence of signification from the auto-affection of the flesh. All perception, all knowing, all communication therefore arises from forms of movement. In a number of publications, he develops this way of understanding knowing with data from geometry in second-grade classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2011). ''Geometry as objective science in elementary classrooms: Mathematics in the flesh''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
