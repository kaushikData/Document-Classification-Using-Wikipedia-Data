      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43935">'''Aggie Bonfire''' was a long-standing annual tradition at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] as part of the [[college rivalry]] with the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sherrington"/&gt;&lt;!--reference here is because FA reviewers were confused--&gt; For 90 years, Texas A&amp;M students—known as [[Glossary of Texas Aggie terms#A|Aggies]]—built and burned a [[bonfire]] on campus each autumn. Known to the Aggie community simply as "Bonfire", the annual autumn event symbolized Aggie students' "burning desire to beat the hell outta [[Glossary of Texas Aggie terms#T|t.u.]]", a derogatory nickname for the University of Texas.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt;&lt;!--odd ref in the lead is required for quotes. It has no other use than to substantiate the quote--&gt; The bonfire was traditionally lit around [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] in conjunction with festivities surrounding the annual [[college football]] game.   Although early bonfires were little more than piles of trash, as time passed the annual event became more organized. Over the years the bonfire grew to an immense size, setting the world record in 1969. In 1999, [[1999 Aggie Bonfire collapse|the Bonfire collapsed during construction]], killing twelve people, eleven students and one former student, and injuring twenty-seven&amp;nbsp;others. The accident led Texas A&amp;M to declare a hiatus on an official Bonfire. However, since 2002, a student-sponsored coalition has constructed an annual unsanctioned, off-campus "Student Bonfire" in the spirit of its predecessor.

==Early years==
[[File:1928 bonfire.jpg|left|thumb|The Aggie Bonfire in 1928, pictured on the Drill Field with the Academic Building in the background.]]
The students of the [[History of Texas A&amp;M University|Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas]], known as Aggies, burned their first bonfire on November 18, 1907, to congratulate the [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|football team]] on a recent win.&lt;ref name="Traditions"/&gt; The first [[Texas A&amp;M University campus|on-campus]] Aggie Bonfire, a heap of trash and debris, was burned in 1909 to generate enthusiasm for a variety of sporting events. A decade later, the focus of the event narrowed to the annual rivalry game between Texas A&amp;M and the University of Texas, held near [[Thanksgiving Day]].&lt;ref name="bernstein"/&gt; Little information was recorded about the early Bonfires; the 1921 Texas A&amp;M yearbook mentioned the "final rally" of the students before the game against Texas, but did not refer to a bonfire. Six years later, the school yearbook published a photograph of the event.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt;

Freshmen were expected to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt; For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912.&lt;ref name="as" &gt;{{citation | title = Vanities of the Bonfire | newspaper = [[American Scientist]] | date = November–December 2000 |volume=88|issue=6| doi = 10.1511/2000.6.486|page=486 | author = Petroski, Henry }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees on the edge of town.&lt;ref name="bernstein"/&gt;

During the 1940s, the school paper described Bonfire as "the greatest event of the football season".&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt; The 1947 [[Texas A&amp;M Corps of Cadets|Corps]] handbook stated that "bonfire symbolizes two things: a burning desire to beat the team from the University of Texas, and the undying flame of love that every loyal Aggie carries in his heart for the school"; this was often shortened to "the burning desire to beat the hell out of t.u."&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt;&lt;!--this reference says only that A&amp;M students call UT "tu"--&gt;&lt;ref name="sherrington"/&gt;
The Bonfire design changed in 1942. [[Universal Studios]], filming the movie ''[[We've Never Been Licked]]'' on the Texas A&amp;M Campus, built a bonfire as a prop for the movie. Their structure used a design similar to a [[teepee]], where all the logs rested against each other in a conical shape.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt; The logs were placed at an angle between 23 and 30&amp;nbsp;degrees, giving it "a tremendous vertical and horizontal resistance".&lt;ref name="burka2000"/&gt; This allowed Bonfire to grow from {{convert|25|ft|m|sigfig=1}} tall to over {{convert|50|ft|m|sigfig=1}} tall.&lt;ref name="as"/&gt; Subsequent Aggies adopted the new idea, and the teepee design became standard for Bonfires for the next twenty-five years.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt;

[[File:Late 50s Aggie Bonfire.jpg|right|thumb|An Aggie Bonfire under construction in the late 1950s]]
Beginning in 1952, the bonfires were constructed entirely from fresh-cut logs.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt; The event suffered its first fatality in 1955, when a student was struck by a swerving car.&lt;ref name="bernstein"/&gt; For unrelated reasons, that same year the Bonfire was moved from Simpson Drill Field in front of the Memorial Student Center to Duncan Field, near the dorms of the Corps of Cadets (whose leaders oversaw construction). In 1957, the structure collapsed two days before Bonfire was to be held, but students worked around-the-clock to rebuild it, and the bonfire burned as scheduled.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt;

During this period, University of Texas students attempted several stunts, trying to light the stack early, but to no avail. In both 1933 and 1948, students from UT rented an airplane and tried to drop fire bombs onto the stack. In one of these instances, the plane ran low on fuel, and was forced to land at [[Easterwood Airport]] in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]]—the wooden portions of the plane found themselves part of Bonfire that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stratton | first = W.K. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Backyard Brawl: Inside the Blood Feud Between Texas and Texas A &amp; M | publisher = Crown Publishing Group | year = 2002 | location = [[New York, NY]] | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-609-61053-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, there was an unsuccessful attempt to plant explosives at the Bonfire site,&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; and, in the late 1970s, a College Station police officer was fired after trying to ignite the bonfire several days ahead of schedule. Students spotted the officer before he could succeed and chased him across campus.&lt;ref name="bernstein"/&gt; In 1999, a Longhorn fan hired someone to build a six-foot model airplane designed to carry a bomb into the wood stack to ignite it prematurely. "He was actually in the process of building that plane when they had the tragedy at bonfire", Mel Stekoll said. "At that point, we scrapped the plan. It would have been the next year that we planned to try it."&lt;ref name="Longhorns for Life"/&gt;

==Organizational change and expansion==
{{details|Aggie Bonfire leadership}}
In 1965, membership in the [[Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]] became voluntary for students at Texas A&amp;M. Before, Corps leaders directed construction of Bonfire. However, because the Corps had no authority over the "non-regs", or civilian students, a separate [[Aggie Bonfire Leadership|Bonfire leadership]] structure was instituted. The new leaders were designated with colored [[hard hats]], or pots, with the overall leaders known as redpots.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt;

The first Bonfire built with both Corps and non-reg participation was in 1963.&lt;ref name="creel"/&gt; The stack was scheduled to burn only days after the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] of [[US President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. Out of respect, the students dismantled the stack.&lt;ref name="bernstein"/&gt; As [[Aggie Yell Leaders|Head Yell Leader]] Mike Marlowe explained, "It is the most we have and the least we can give."&lt;ref name="creel" &gt;{{citation | last = Creel | first = Brady | title =...And they call it 'Aggie Bonfire'| newspaper = The Battalion | date = November 19, 2001 | url =http://www.thebatt.com/2.8482/and-they-call-it-aggie-bonfire-1.1214336 | archive-url =https://archive.is/20130626162357/http://www.thebatt.com/2.8482/and-they-call-it-aggie-bonfire-1.1214336 | dead-url =yes | archive-date =June 26, 2013 | accessdate = 2013-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years the structure became more elaborate, and in 1967 the flames could be seen {{convert|25|mi|km|sigfig=1}} away. In 1969, the stack of logs set the world record for the height of a bonfire at {{convert|109|ft|10|in|m|0|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref name="bernstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldRec"/&gt; Out of concern for the safety of participants and the community, the university limited the size to {{convert|55|ft|m|0}} tall and {{convert|45|ft|m|0}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="as"/&gt; As an added precaution, nearby campus buildings were equipped with rooftop [[Fire sprinkler system|sprinkler systems]]. Despite the new height restrictions, in the 1970s, the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' listed Aggie Bonfire as the largest Bonfire in the world.&lt;ref name="bernstein"/&gt;

In 1978, Bonfire shifted from its previous teepee design to a [[wedding cake]] style, in which upper stacks of logs were wedged on top of lower stacks. The structure was built around a fortified center pole, made from two [[telephone poles]] spliced together by cutting matching notches, approximately {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} long, and with {{convert|5|gal|L|0}} of glue. Four steel plates were bolted to the two poles, and a {{convert|3/8|in|mm}} cable wrapped around the joint and secured to the pole with steel staples. Four perimeter poles were placed {{convert|150|ft|m}} away and ropes were stretched between the perimeter poles to center poles and tension placed on them to hold the center pole together. After the center pole was erected, logs were placed vertically around it in a multi-tiered wedding cake design composed of thousands of logs.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; By 1984, the logs were sloping only 14&amp;nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees]].&lt;ref name="burka2000"/&gt; The [[spiral]] arrangement of the logs was designed to make Bonfire collapse into itself in a twisting motion, thus protecting spectators.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; Although the tradition stated that if Bonfire burned through midnight then A&amp;M would win the following day's football game, the introduction of the wedding cake design drastically reduced the time it took for Bonfire to fall, sometimes burning for only 30 or 45&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="burka2000"/&gt;

Despite the complexity of the design, there were no formal written instructions or architectural blueprints for the construction of Bonfire.  Knowledge on how to build the structure was passed verbally from one redpot to the next.  By 1999, the only written documentation on the building of Bonfire was the rough schematic printed on the back of the official Bonfire T-shirt worn by participants from the freshman honors dormitory, Lechner.&lt;ref name=espnEden/&gt;

While the Bonfires of the 1960s were constructed in five to ten days, working primarily in daylight, by the late 1970s, changes in the school led to a more elaborate and lengthy construction schedule.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt; Construction began in late October with "Cut", obtaining wood by cutting down trees with axes, which took several weekends.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; After Cut, students brought the logs to campus during "Load", a process by which the logs were loaded by hand onto flatbed trucks and brought to campus.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; In early November, crews began "Stack", a three-week period in which the logs were wired together and Bonfire took shape. Near the end of stack, known as "Push", students worked around the clock in rotating shifts. The first four of the six stacks were built with the efforts of all safety-trained participants. The day before Bonfire was scheduled to burn, junior redpots would build the fifth stack, and then senior redpots would build the sixth.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt;

[[File:Yelllead-Bonfire.jpg|thumb|left|Yell Leaders and the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band follow the Redpots around the bonfire prior to Burn in 1992.]]

During Cut, all logs were felled by hand, with students working in teams to chop down each tree with their axes. The manual labor ensured that participants were invested in each log that went into the Bonfire.  Once the trees had fallen, brownpots, the "executive lumberjacks", used chainsaws to cut limbs and prepare the logs.&lt;ref name=espnEden/&gt;

To ensure safety during the Stack period, the organizers maintained a perimeter around the working area, and allowed only safety-trained students through. Cranes, donated by local construction companies, assisted in getting logs onto the upper tiers, and volunteers from those companies were on-hand at all times to offer advice. [[Emergency medical technician]]s were also required to be on site at all times and no more than 70&amp;nbsp;students at a time were allowed on the stack.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; Once the stack was finished, "an [[outhouse]] constructed by the sophomores of Texas A&amp;M's "Fightin' Texas Aggie Band" and painted orange [symbolizing a] [[Glossary of Texas Aggie terms#T|t.u.]] [[Fraternities and sororities|frat]] house"&lt;ref name="matthewwatkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="turef"/&gt; was bedecked with derogatory statements about rival University of Texas at Austin and then placed on top of the stack.&lt;ref name="eagle1"/&gt;

Although between two and five thousand students participated in the construction of Bonfire each year, most worked only part-time, and many worked only one or two shifts.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt; Student workers were organized by dormitories or Corps units, with a separate off-campus student team. Many former students participated with teams they belonged to as students. Each team had assigned shifts, although individuals were not limited to working only the assigned shifts.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; Students working on Bonfire wore "grodes"—old T-shirts, jeans, and boots. By tradition, grodes were either not washed until after Bonfire burned or not washed at all.&lt;ref name="stratton"/&gt;

In 1983, the city of College Station began manufacturing [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] [[city limits]] signs for students to place at the summit of the Bonfire so that students would stop stealing signs from Austin.&lt;ref name="bernstein"/&gt; The [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]] began building the outhouse, ending the tradition of stealing Bonfire's components.&lt;ref name="bragg1985"/&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Killtree-Bonfire.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Student felling a tree for Bonfire]]
Although women were allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was partially rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt; In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them as they tried to take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack.&lt;ref name="bragg"/&gt; To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.&lt;ref name="women" &gt;{{citation | last = Lebas | first = John | title = Women Have Increasing Role in Bonfire | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date = November 19, 1999 | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/191199d.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20070930200927/http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/191199d.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = September 30, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries plagued the construction process. In 1981, student Wiley Keith Jopling died after being run over by a tractor at the Cut site.&lt;ref name="chron15Nov1989"/&gt; At the 1985 Cut site, one student broke his hip,&lt;ref name="bragg1985"/&gt; and, in 1989, another student lost two fingers when logs crushed his hand.&lt;ref name="rugeley"/&gt; Fractures and amputations were rare, but many students suffered cuts, scrapes, or exposure to [[poison ivy]].&lt;ref name="bernstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bragg1985"/&gt;  [[Hazing]], including beatings with ax handles, was common.&lt;ref name=espnEden&gt;{{citation|last=Eden|first=Scott|title=The Burning Desire of Texas A&amp;M|newspaper=ESPN|date=November 26, 2014|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/11937545/texas-bonfire-burns-fifteen-years-collapse-kills-12-students}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s also saw increased alcohol consumption during the Bonfire ceremony. In 1988, police issued 140 [[Minor in Possession]] (of alcohol) citations and arrested six people. The following year, the local police department brought a [[paddywagon]] to the site for the first time, as they anticipated mass arrests for alcohol violations.&lt;ref name="rugeley"/&gt; As many as 150 police officers were on duty during the Bonfire burning from the Texas A&amp;M and College Station police departments and the [[Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission]].&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;

In 1989, the Campus Ministry Association, representing 17&amp;nbsp;religious denominations, unanimously approved a resolution asking the university to change Bonfire because of concerns about safety, participant academic performance, humanitarian considerations, and the environment. Shortly afterwards, the Faculty Senate's Committee of the Whole approved a resolution asking for a panel to explore alternatives to Bonfire.&lt;ref name="chron15Nov1989"/&gt;

Although students protested Bonfire's environmental impact since 1970, no changes were made for decades.&lt;ref name="smith2007"/&gt; In 1990, student Scott Hantman asked the Bonfire leadership to help him address the problem. The group solicited volunteers, and in the spring of 1991, they planted 400&amp;nbsp;trees. The tradition, [[Aggie Replant]], has been repeated annually. The Replant organization became independent of Bonfire in 1994 when it gained its own Student Government Committee.&lt;ref name = "Replant"/&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Rebuilt-Aggie-Bonfire-1994.jpg|thumb|right|Students finishing the rebuild of the 1994 Bonfire&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAuJ3hDsrBU rebuild of the 1994 Bonfire]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--It wasn't completely finished until hours before the burn--&gt;&lt;!--This time-lapse of the 1994 Collapse &amp; Rebuild is a publicly available video; youtube is simply the easiest format--&gt;]]

After being held at the Duncan Intramural Fields on the south side of A&amp;M's campus for twenty-seven years, in 1992, Bonfire was relocated to the Polo Fields on the northeast &lt;!--note that the source has the location wrong and its actual site can be seen with the location of the memorial--&gt;corner of campus. This more isolated site, with a larger area for people to gather, made it a safer location.&lt;ref name="move"/&gt; After heavy rains in 1994, the partially completed Bonfire began to slowly lean to the side as the soil underneath shifted. Student officials had enough warning to clear the area and tear down the Bonfire one week before its scheduled burn date.&lt;ref name="bernstein" &gt;{{citation | last = Bernstein | first = Alan | title = Aggie Bonfire holds distinction as Texas symbol | newspaper= The Houston Chronicle | date = November 18, 1999 | url =http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/bonfire/386353.html | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071225220124/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/bonfire/386353.html | archivedate =2007-12-25 | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="women"/&gt; Nine tractors, two bulldozers, and two forklifts dismantled the stack on October 26, 1994, which, at 70% completed, stood {{convert|40|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|45|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref name="stewart"/&gt;
Students and alumni flocked to the Polo Fields, working around the clock, to rebuild the Bonfire in time for the game.&lt;ref name="creel"/&gt; It was completed only hours before it was scheduled to burn.&lt;ref name="rebuild"/&gt; After the 1994 Bonfire was burned, two tons of [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] were spread on the Polo Fields to stabilize the ground. This layer hardened to a consistency similar to concrete.&lt;ref name="lebas2000"/&gt;

In 1996 a student, Greg White, died in a car accident on his way home from Cut. The student and several companions were riding in the bed of a [[pickup truck]] when the driver lost control and the truck rolled. Nine other students were injured.&lt;ref name="1996accident"/&gt;

The 1999 collapse of Bonfire was witnessed by thousands of people around the world. The Texas A&amp;M Department of Computer Science set up a camera aimed at the Bonfire site that took a picture every 10&amp;nbsp;minutes and posted it on the Internet. On the day of the collapse over 29,000 visitors visited the web page, at a time when only 20 million people worldwide had Internet access.&lt;ref name="silverman"/&gt;

[[File:198990bonfire.jpg|thumb|left|Bonfire burns in 1989]]&lt;!--The sign says 92 which would make it the 1989 Bonfire--&gt;
In its later years, students building Bonfire used logs donated by local landowners who wanted their land cleared for construction or farming.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; Over 8000&amp;nbsp;logs were used each year in the late 1990s, taking about 5000&amp;nbsp;students a combined 125,000&amp;nbsp;man-hours to construct.&lt;ref name="as"/&gt; After being doused in 700&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (318&amp;nbsp;kg) of [[kerosene|jet fuel]], applied by staff members at A&amp;M's Fire Training School, the [[Yell Leaders]], [[Drum Major]]s, and Redpots then lit the stack with torches the night before the annual football game against the University of Texas when at home and two nights before the game when it was played in Austin.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt;

This event was popular among current and former students and people traveled from all over the state and the nation to observe the burning of Bonfire. Hotel rooms within {{convert|65|mi|km}} of College Station were booked weeks or months in advance of the date Bonfire burned.&lt;ref name="turner"/&gt; Crowds ranged from 30,000 to 70,000&amp;nbsp;people, depending on the weather and the strength of the Aggie football team.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; The 1998 Bonfire was broadcast live on [[Fox Sports Net|Fox Sports Southwest]].&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;

==Bonfire Memorial==
[[File:Bonfire Memorial.JPG|left|thumb|The Bonfire Memorial Spirit Ring]]
A memorial was constructed on the university polo fields, the site of the accident. Construction began in October 2003 and was completed by November 2004.&lt;ref name="spruce"/&gt; On November 18, 2004, five years following the incident, the Bonfire Memorial was officially dedicated. The memorial is composed of three design elements:&lt;ref name="mfon"/&gt;
* Tradition Plaza – Marks the entrance to the memorial and reflects on Aggie traditions.&lt;ref name="mfon"/&gt;
* History Walk – Consists of 89&amp;nbsp;stones representing the 89&amp;nbsp;previous&amp;nbsp;years of Bonfire. A gap in the timeline signifies the 1963 Bonfire, which did not burn due to the John F. Kennedy assassination. The three previous Bonfire-related deaths are also memorialized on this time line.&lt;ref name="mfon"/&gt;
* Spirit Ring – The ring surrounds the site of the collapse and represents the spirit that brought the students together. Twelve portals are placed around the ring, oriented toward each student's hometown. Twenty-seven stones complete the ring, representing the 27&amp;nbsp;students injured in the collapse.&lt;ref name="design"/&gt;

The memorial design has been recognized by several organizations as an outstanding architectural design and masonry accomplishment. The [[American Institute of Architects]], San Antonio Chapter, recognized the memorial as a winner of the 2005 AIA San Antonio Design Award.&lt;ref name="AIA-SA"/&gt; The memorial also was recognized as a winner of the 2005 [[Mason Contractors Association of America|MCAA]] International Excellence in Masonry Awards.&lt;ref name="Masonry"/&gt;

To further honor the victims, in 2000, the Aggie Replant Committee planted twelve [[live oak]] trees at the Polo Grounds.&lt;ref name="Replant"/&gt;

==Continuation: Student Bonfire==
[[File:2007-SBF.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The 2007 Student Bonfire]]
Shortly after the university officially cancelled Bonfire, students began planning an unofficial bonfire for November 2002. Known as the "Unity Project", it became the first unofficial Bonfire since the 1930s. This fire consisted of three piles of wood, with the center stack being {{convert|35|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name="badger"/&gt;  Despite a lack of official advertisement, over one thousand spectators attended.&lt;ref name="espnEden"/&gt;

The following year, the unofficial event was rebranded Student Bonfire.&lt;ref name="windle"/&gt; Now a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization, Student Bonfire has official bylaws and a Board of Directors comprising former students.  The bylaws specify the design that must be used each year, and no changes have been permitted since the first burn in 2003.  This design, based on the recommendation of the 2002 university task force and approved by a structural engineer, results in a Bonfire less than half the size of those from the 1960s.&lt;ref name="espnEden"/&gt;  In a departure from tradition, every log in the stack touches the ground.  To maintain the traditional wedding-cake design, the logs are cut to different heights, with the tallest set reaching {{convert|32|ft|m}} high.  The lowered height eliminates the need for a spliced center pole.  Instead, a single utility pole, sunk {{convert|15|ft|m}} into the ground, serves as the center pole. As in the pre-1999 versions of Bonfire, each log is tied to the log next to it with baling wire.  To further fortify the structure, aircraft-grade steel cable is wrapped around each tier.&lt;ref name="espnEden"/&gt;  For added support, four {{convert|24|ft|m|adj=on}} poles are spaced evenly around the stack and then bolted to the {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=on}} center pole, each with a steel pipe. These poles are known as Windle-sticks, after Levi Windle, a staunch supporter of Student Bonfire who died in an unrelated accident in 2003.&lt;ref name="windle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hensley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thebatt"/&gt;

The Board changed or eliminated many of the minor traditions that had proliferated during Aggie Bonfire, primarily for safety reasons.  Alcohol is no longer permitted, and hazing has been banned.  The Bonfire leadership structure has remained in place, although in 2014 only 10 of the 26 dorms were represented by Bonfire crews.&lt;ref name="espnEden"/&gt;  Attendance for Student Bonfire ranges from 8,000–15,000&amp;nbsp;people and the event is held in [[Brazos County, Texas|Brazos County]] or one of the surrounding counties.&lt;ref name="windle"/&gt;  The 2013 Student Bonfire attracted 12,000 people, despite being postponed until January due to flooding.&lt;ref name="espnEden"/&gt;

[[File:Ardabil-glim.JPG|thumb|An Ardabil [[kilim]]]]
'''Ardabil rugs''' originate from [[Ardabil]] located in the province of [[Ardabil Province]] in northwestern [[Iran]], 639 kilometers from [[Tehran]]. Ardabil has a long and illustrious history of [[Persian carpet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beattie|first1=M.|title=ARDABĪL CARPET – Encyclopaedia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ardabil-carpet-persian-carpet-acquired-by-the-victoria-and-albert-museum-in-1893|website=www.iranicaonline.org|publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Ardabil Carpet|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ardabil-Carpet|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[weaving]].

The reign of the [[Safavid Dynasty]] in the 16th and 17th centuries represented the peak of Persian carpet making in the region. The name Ardabil comes from the [[Avesta]] (The sacred book of [[Zoroastrian]]s) and has the literal meaning of a tall holy place. The weavers in Ardabil ply their craft using Azerbaijani knots. Two of the most famous carpets in existence today are a pair of [[Ardabil Carpet|Persian carpets from Ardabil]]. One of the carpets, measuring 34' x 17', is on display in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]], England.

Ardabil rugs feature motifs that are very similar to [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] rugs, but with more motifs and objects woven into the borders. The colors are also lighter. The patterns are predominantly geometric and the most common layouts on Ardabil rugs are [[medallion]]s, multiple connected diamond-shaped medallions, and all-over octagonal shapes. The most recognized design found on Ardabil rugs is the famous Mahi (Herati) design - a diamond medallion and small fish throughout. Some modern weavers have begun to favor bold geometric patterns over the traditional Mahi ([[Herat]]i) design, and have added colors such as turquoise and purple to the more traditional red, pink, ivory, green, and blue.

The warp on Ardabil rugs is mostly cotton, while the [[weft]] is either cotton or wool, although silk is also used as weft on fine Ardabil rugs. The weavers may also incorporate silk into the woolen pile in order to accentuate highlights in the pattern. Ardabil rugs include some widely known carpets: " Ardabil", "Sheikh Safi", "Sarabi", "Shah Abbasi" and "Mir".

==Sheikh-Safi==
{{main|Ardabil Carpet}}
The Sheikh-Safi or [[Ardabil Carpet]]s are a pair of carpets presented as a gift to the [[Ardabil (city)#Attractions|complex of Sheikh Safi-ad-din]] in Ardabil in 1539 CE.  They are considered by many the finest carpets in the world. For Azerbaijani and Iranian Shiites, the “Sheikh Safi” mausoleum ranked second among the places of pilgrimage (the first being the [[Imam Reza]] mausoleum in [[Mashad]]). This type of rug is noted for its sophisticated construction, original compositional elements and decorative completeness of the 16-point turunj located in the middle of the center field. The sketch was created by a talented artist, while the carpet itself was woven by artful craftsmen of Tabriz, or perhaps even those from Ardabil. In 1539, the carpet was bought by [[Kashan]]i pilgrim and presented as a charity gift to the “Sheikh Safi” mosque. However, before handing it over to the mosque,  Maghsud Kashanitold the makers to weave his name on the rug along with the following stanza: “I have no other shelter but yours, except for your doors there is no other roof but for this home where I can lay my head” (The couplet from the 65th gazelle by the 14th century lyric poet [[hafez]] (1300–1389). And beneath it: “The work by a servant of this home, Maghsud Kashani” and the figure 946 (1539). This addition is perceived as a patch.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  The original “Sheikh Safi”, repaired from the other of the pair, is displayed at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, with the second carpet, reduced in size, in Los Angeles.

==Sarabi==
These carpets derived their names from the town of [[Sarab County|Sarab]] situated between Tabriz and Ardabil, There are the following versions of the Sarabi carpet:

The center field covered with the vertical lines, which are decorated by blooming branches arranged one after another in am asymmetrical way. 
The center field with one gel. The carpets are beautiful and harmonious in color. The vegetal ornamental elements are woven almost in dotted lines, which to some extent resembles Karabakh carpets.

==Shah Abbasi==
The name of these carpets is associated with [[Shah Abbas I]] (1587–1629), the fifth ruler of the [[Safavid]]s empire. Shah Abbas moved the capital of the Safavids to the internal regions of Iran, namely to the town of [[Isfahan]]. As a result, many of the prominent craftsmen moved  to Isfahan. The “Gum-Shah Abbasi” carpet is noted for the elements of an unusual form named “Şah Abbasi gülləri” (in Azerbaijani “Flowers of Shakh Abbas”). They largely consist of fantastical flowers as well as fig leaves. The asymmetrical arrangement of the elements along the horizontal line is viewed as the characteristic feature of this carpet.

==Mir==
The name of the carpet, which belongs to the Ardabil group of the Tabriz school, is associated with the names of the villages of Mir and Mirshi to the south of Ardabil.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The composition of the center field is formed by butteh ({{Lang-fa| '''بته'''}} ''bush''). The forms of these buteh as well as their vertical and horizontal arrangement remind of the carpets of the Shirvan type “Maraza” and “Khila-buta”. Yet the individual butteh on the “Mir” carpet have a much simpler composition. This type of butteh can be also found on the fabric manufactured in Tabriz, and [[Kerman]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The border and the center edge of the carpet are unusual: they used to consist of vegetal curve-linear elements but as the weaving technique improved they acquired new forms.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The '''''camisa'' blouse''' is a garment that originated in the [[Philippines]]. It is made from a cloth that has been woven using thread made from the [[pineapple]] plant. The thread is known as [[piña]] thread. Clothing and accessories, like shawls, were made out of piña. These began to be woven in the Philippines in the 16th century, and are still being made today. THE TEXTILE MUSEUM says that "The pineapple plant is not a native species to the Philippines it is thought to have been introduced by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]]". Because the cloth took a very long time to make, it was highly sought after and wearing a '''camisa blouse''' was seen as a sign of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.textilemuseum.org/totm/camisaindex.htm | title=Camisa (blouse) | accessdate=December 1, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016055635/http://www.textilemuseum.org/totm/camisaindex.htm# | archive-date=2011-10-16 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1850s, the sleeves of the carmisa blouse, which were made out of the embroidered piña thread became larger and tubular in shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBdpE-aUchkC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%22Camisa+blouse%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vOzaFKUYlY&amp;sig=6FCUCEhy4Z5KtqAD0UwrG6qoOzA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jVTXTp7nMoeRiQes7PzEDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Camisa%20blouse%22&amp;f=false | title=The Politics of Dress in Asia and the Americas | accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christian Felix Weiße.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Felix Weiße (1769) by [[Anton Graff]]]]
'''Christian Felix Weiße''' (1726–1804) was a German writer and [[Pedagogy|pedagogue]]. Weiße was among the leading representatives of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Germany and is regarded as the founder of German [[children's literature]].

==Life==
Weiße was born as twin on 28 January 1726 in [[Annaberg-Buchholz|Annaberg]] in the [[Ore Mountains]] as the son of Christian Heinrich Weiße and his wife, Christian Elisabeth. His father was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] at a [[Latin school]] and teacher for oriental and modern European languages. When Weiße was one year old, the family moved to [[Altenburg]], [[Thuringia]], 45&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Leipzig]], where he then attended the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] and made his first attempts at writing poetry. His father had died in 1730.

His family moved then to Leipzig, where he studied [[philology]] and [[theology]] from 1745 until 1750 at the [[University of Leipzig]]. During this time, he became acquainted with [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], [[Friederike Caroline Neuber]], [[Gottlieb Rabener]] and [[Ewald Christian von Kleist]].

After he finished his studies, Weiße became a private tutor to the Count Geyersberg, also a student in Leipzig. [[Christoph Friedrich Nicolai|Friedrich Nicolai]] asked Weiße in 1759 to become editor of the magazine ''Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften'' (''Library of the Beautiful Sciences'') which Nicolai had founded two years before; Weiße published this magazine and its successor until 1788. The same year, 1759, Weiße travelled to Paris; on his return, he relinquished the tutur position and became social companion to Count Schulenburg on the count's [[:de:Schloss Burgscheidungen|castle]] in [[Burgscheidungen]].

Weiße became district tax collector in Leipzig in 1762 and married in the following year Christiane Platner, the daughter of a renowned Leipzig surgeon and sister of [[Ernst Platner]]. In 1790, the [[patronage]] of Count Schulenburg allowed him to acquire the castle in [[:de:Stötteritz|Stötteritz]] (today part of Leipzig). He redesigned it completely and established an [[English garden]]. The property changed from an [[Estate (land)|estate]] to a summerhouse and garden where a [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] sees guests like [[Christian Garve]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland]], [[Moritz August von Thümmel]] and [[Jean Paul]].

Apart from his poetry and plays, Weiße had great success with his magazine ''Der Kinderfreund'' (''The Children's Friend'') which he published from 1775 until 1782 in 24 volumes; it is regarded as the first magazine for children in Germany. Four of his poems [[List of concert arias, songs and canons by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart#Songs|were set]] to music by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. Weiße was not appreciated by the literary representatives of the then new movement, [[Sturm und Drang]]. His most lasting success were the [[libretto]]s to [[Johann Adam Hiller]]'s ''[[Singspiel]]e''.

Weiße died on 16 December 1804 in Stötteritz; he is buried in the [[Alter Johannisfriedhof]] in Leipzig. He was survived by his wife who died in 1813. A notable child from this marriage was the historian and jurist [[:de:Christian Ernst Weiße|Christian Ernst Weiße]].

The '''dollar sign''' ('''$''' or '''[[File:Cifrão symbol.svg|text-bottom|13px]]''') is a symbol primarily used to indicate the various units of [[currency]] around the world. The symbol can interchangeably have one or two vertical strokes. In common usage, the sign appears to the left of the amount specified, as in $1 (read: one dollar).

== Origin ==

[[File:Potosi Real.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Spanish real|Spanish silver ''real]]'' or [[peso]] of 1768 - the right-hand pillar clearly resembles the dollar sign.]]

[[File:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Silver 8 real coin of [[Philip V of Spain]], 1739 - This earlier example pre-dates other explanations by at least 30 years.]]

[[File:Columnas Plus Ultra.png|thumb|200px|left| The [[Pillars of Hercules]] with a small "S" shaped ribbon around in the City of [[Seville]], Spain (16th century).]]

=== Pillars of Hercules ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}

A common hypothesis holds that the sign derives from the symbolic representation of the [[Pillars of Hercules]] – this representation can either have a banner separately around each pillar, or as in the [[Coat of arms of Spain|Spanish coat of arms]], a banner curling between them.

In 1492, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] adopted the symbol of the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and added the Latin warning ''Non plus ultra'' meaning "nothing further beyond", indicating "this is the end of the (known) world". But when Christopher Columbus came to America, the legend was changed to ''[[Plus ultra (motto)|Plus ultra]]'', meaning "further beyond". The Pillars of Hercules wrapped in a banner thus became a symbol of the [[New World]]. The link between this symbol and the dollar sign is more clearly seen in Spanish coins of the period - which show two pillars, each with a separate banner, rather than one banner spanning both pillars. In this example the right-hand pillar clearly resembles the dollar sign, and additionally directly relates to the use of money.

[[File:Escudo de España (mazonado).svg|thumb|200px|left|[[Coat of arms of Spain|Spain's coat of arms]]]]

The symbol was adopted by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and was part of his coat of arms representing Spain's American possessions. The symbol was later stamped on coins minted in gold and silver. The coin, also known as [[Spanish dollar]], was the first global currency used in the entire world since the Spanish Empire was the first global Empire. These coins, depicting the pillars over two hemispheres and a small "S"-shaped ribbon around each, were spread throughout America, Europe and Asia. According to this, traders wrote signs that, instead of saying Spanish dollar (piece of eight, ''real de a ocho'' in Spanish or ''peso duro''), had this symbol made by hand, and this in turn evolved into a simple S with two vertical bars. When the US gained their independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], they created the American dollar, but in its early decades they continued to use the Spanish dollar, which was more trusted in all markets.

The United States, even after independence, was still using the [[pound sterling]] as currency. This is attested in state legislation of the early 1780s, referring to pounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Copyright Statute,(1783), p. 370 |url=http://www.copyrighthistory.org/cam/tools/request/showRepresentation.php?id=representation_us_1783d&amp;pagenumber=1_2&amp;imagesize=middle}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maryland Copyright Statute (1783) |url=http://www.copyrighthistory.org/cam/tools/request/showRepresentation.php?id=representation_us_1783e&amp;pagenumber=1_2&amp;imagesize=middle}}&lt;/ref&gt; which predated the U.S. Constitution and federal legislation.

Given the origin of this theory – related to Spanish (and Portuguese) colonisation of the Americas – it is likely that the cifrão or peso signs share the same origin, and that the double stroke usage is merely a stylistic variant, rather than a distinct character.

== Alternative origin hypotheses ==

[[File:Dollar Symbol Evolution.svg|thumb|left|150px|alt=Dollar symbol evolution|Evolution of the dollar sign according to the best documented alternative hypothesis (top) and one alternative hypothesis (bottom)]]

The sign is first attested in [[Hispanic America|Spanish American]], [[United States|American]], [[Canada under British rule (1763–1867)|Canadian]], [[New Spain|Mexican]] and other [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] business correspondence in the 1770s, referring to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish American]] [[peso]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence |last=Kinnaird |date=July 1976 |jstor=967081 |title=The Western Fringe of Revolution |journal=[[The Western Historical Quarterly]] |volume=7 |issue=3 |page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Popular Science]] |journal=Popular Science |title=Origin of Dollar Sign is Traced to Mexico |date=February 1930 |issn=0161-7370 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ykDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA59,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as "[[Spanish dollar]]" or "piece of eight" in North America, which provided the model for the [[United States dollar|currency]] that the United States adopted in 1792 and the larger coins of the new Spanish American republics such as the [[Mexican peso]], Peruvian eight-[[Peruvian real|real]] and Bolivian eight-[[Bolivian sol|sol]] coins.

This explanation holds that the sign evolved out of the Spanish and Spanish American [[scribal abbreviation]] "p&amp;#x02E2;" for pesos. A study of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century manuscripts shows that the ''s'' gradually came to be written over the ''p'', developing into a close equivalent to the "$" mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Florian |last=Cajori |authorlink=Florian Cajori |year=1993 |orig-year=1929 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7juWmvQSTvwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA22&amp;dq=isbn:0486677664#PRA1-PA22,M1 |title=A History of Mathematical Notations |volume=2 |pages=15–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Arthur S. |last1=Aiton |first2=Benjamin W. |last2=Wheeler |date=May 1931 |jstor=2506275 |title=The First American Mint |journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review |volume=11 |issue=2 |page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nussbaum |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Nussbaum |title=A History of the Dollar |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1957 |location=New York |page=56 |quote=The foreign coins remained in circulation [in the United States], and the more important among them, especially the Spanish (including the Mexican) dollars, were declared by Congress on February 9, 1793, to be legal tender.

=== Other hypotheses ===

There are a number of other hypotheses about the origin of the symbol, some with a measure of academic acceptance, others the symbolic equivalent of [[false etymologies]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Cajori discusses the origins of the slash-8, the Potosi mint mark, the Pillars of Hercules, the "U.S.", the Roman sestertius, and the Boaz and Jachin hypotheses and discounts them in ''A History of Mathematical Notations'' (Vol. 2), 15–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the various hypotheses, the simplest one is that the barred S is actually a typo modified 8, from its obvious link with the pieces of eight, the popular name of the Spanish dollar. The added (single or double) bar should be the same commonly used to distinguish a letter dedicated to a currency value, like £.

'''Kingdom of Sicily'''
[[French denier|Denari]] minted by [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred of Hohenstaufen]] in the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] between 1258 and 1266 had what can be construed as an early dollar symbol.  These coins were widely circulated outside Europe due to the Crusades, including the Crusade that targeted Tunis.

=== Drawn with two vertical lines ===
{{see also|Cifrão}}

Several alternative hypotheses relate specifically to the dollar sign drawn with two vertical lines.

==== From "U.S." ====
A dollar sign with two vertical lines could have started off as a [[monogram]] of 'USA', used on money bags issued by the [[United States Mint]]. The letters U and S superimposed resemble the historical double-stroke dollar sign [[File:Cifrão symbol.svg|19px]]: the bottom of the 'U' disappears into the bottom curve of the 'S', leaving two vertical lines. It is postulated in the papers of Dr. James Alton James, a professor of history at Northwestern University from 1897 to 1935, that the symbol with two strokes was an adapted design of the patriot [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = James | first = James Alton | title = Robert Morris: The Life and Times of an Unknown Patriot | publisher = Books for Libraries Press | year = 1970 | origyear = 1937 | location = Freeport | page = 356 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kht_DEllNccC | isbn = 978-0-8369-5527-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Morris was such a zealous patriot – known as the "Financier of the Revolution in the West" – that James came to believe that conjecture does not overstep its bounds in purporting this hypothesis as viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = James | first = James Alton | title = 'Robert Morris, Financier of the Revolution in the West'. | publisher = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review | year = 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar idea claims that the letters U and S would stand for unit of silver, referencing pieces of eight again, but that is unlikely since one would expect it to be in Spanish instead.

==== German thaler ====
Another hypothesis is that it derives from the symbol used on a German [[Thaler]]. According to Ovason (2004), on one type of thaler one side showed a [[crucifix]] while the other showed a [[Snake|serpent]] hanging from a [[cross]], the letters NU near the serpent's head, and on the other side of the cross the number 21. This refers to the [[Bible]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], Chapter 21 (see [[Nehushtan]]).

A similar symbol, constructed by superposition of "S" and "I" or "J", was used to denote German [[Joachimsthaler]] ("S" and "J" standing for [[St. Joachim]] who gave his name to [[Jáchymov|the place where the first thalers were minted]]). It was known in the English-speaking world by the 17th century, appearing in 1686 edition of ''An Introduction to Merchants' Accounts'' by [[John Collins (mathematician)|John Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3110685 Florence Edler de Roover. Concerning the Ancestry of the Dollar Sign. - Bulletin of the Business Historical Society. Vol. 19, No. 2 (Apr., 1945), pp. 63-64]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later history ==
[[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was the first to use this symbol in official documents and in official communications with [[Oliver Pollock]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The U.S. dollar was directly based on the [[Spanish Dollar|Spanish Milled Dollar]] when, in the [[Coinage Act of 1792]], the first Mint Act, its value was fixed (per the [[U.S. Constitution]], Article I, Section 8, clause 1 power of the [[United States Congress]] "To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures") as being "of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current, and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver".

According to a plaque in [[St Andrews]], [[Scotland]], the dollar sign was first cast into type at a foundry in [[Philadelphia]], [[United States]] in 1797 by the Scottish immigrants John Baine, Archibald Binney and James Ronaldson.
[[File:Bailie bell plaque.jpg|thumb|right|The plaque in St. Andrews.]]

The dollar sign did not appear on [[Coins of the United States dollar|U.S. coinage]] until February 2007,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} when it was used on the reverse of a $1 coin authorized by the [[Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 109-145, 119 Stat. 2664 (Dec. 22, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The dollar sign appears as early as 1847 on the $100 Mexican War notes and the reverse of the 1868 $1000 United States note.&lt;ref&gt;Cuhaj, p. 100, 321–22&lt;/ref&gt;  The dollar sign also appears on the reverse of the 1934 $100,000 note.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In Japanese and Korean, the [[Han character]] 弗 has been repurposed to represent the dollar sign due to its visual similarity.

== Use in computer software ==
The dollar sign is one of the few symbols that are almost universally present in computer [[character set]]s but rarely needed in its literal meaning within computer [[software]].  As a result, the character has been used on computers for many purposes unrelated to money. Its uses in [[programming language]]s have often influenced or provoked its uses in [[operating system]]s, and [[application software|applications]].

===Encoding===

The dollar sign "$" has Unicode code point U+0024 (inherited from Latin-1).

* {{unichar
| 0024
| Dollar sign
| ulink =
| image =
| cwith =
| size  =

}} (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;dollar;&lt;/code&gt; in HTML5&lt;ref&gt;HTML5 is the only version of HTML that has a named entity for the dollar sign, see https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html ("The following sections present the complete lists of character entity references.") and https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-html5-20140731/syntax.html#named-character-references ("dollar;").&lt;/ref&gt;)

There are no separate characters for one- and two-line variants. This is typeface-dependent.

There are also three other code points that originate from other East Asian standards: the Taiwanese [[Small Form Variants|small form variant]], the CJK [[Halfwidth and fullwidth forms|fullwidth form]], and the Japanese [[emoji]]. The glyphs for these code points are typically larger or smaller than the primary code point, but the difference is mostly aesthetic or typographic, and the meanings of the symbols are the same.

However, for usage as the special character in various computing applications (see following sections), U+0024 is typically the only code that is recognized.

===Programming languages===

* $ was used for defining [[string (computer science)|string]] [[BASIC#Data types and variables|variables]] in older versions of the [[BASIC]] language ("$" was often pronounced "string" instead of "dollar" in this use).
* $ is used for defining hexadecimal constants in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-like languages such as [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], and in some variants of [[assembly language]].
* $ is prefixed to names to define [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] in the [[PHP]] language and the [[AutoIt]] automation script language, [[scalar (computing)|scalar]] variables in the [[Perl]] language (see [[sigil (computer programming)]]), and global variables in the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] language.  In Perl programming this includes scalar elements of [[Array data structure|arrays]] ''$array[7]'' and [[Hash table#Associative arrays|hashes]] ''$hash{foo}''.
* In most [[shell script]]ing languages, $ is used for interpolating ('''s'''ubstitution of) [[environment variable]]s, special variables, arithmetic computations and special characters, and for performing translation of localised strings. [[Christopher Strachey|Christopher Stratchey's]] [[General Purpose Macrogenerator|GPM]], the inspiration for the [[Multics]] shell, used the non-[[ASCII]] symbol [[Section sign|§]] for macro expansion.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* $ is used in the [[ALGOL 68]] language to delimit [[ALGOL 68#formatted transput|transput format]] regions.
* $ is used in the [[TeX]] [[typesetting]] language to delimit mathematical regions.
* In many versions of [[FORTRAN 66]], $ could be used as an alternative to a quotation mark for delimiting strings.
* In [[PL/M]], $ can be used to put a visible separation between words in compound identifiers. For example, 'Some$Name' refers to the same thing as 'SomeName'.
* In [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], $ is used as a function application operator.
* In an [[AutoHotkey]] script, a hotkey declared with $ is not triggered by a 'Send' command elsewhere in the script.
* In several [[JavaScript]] frameworks such as [[Prototype.js]] and [[jQuery]], $ is a common [[utility class]], and is often referred to as ''the buck''.
* In [[JavaScript]] from ES6 onward it is used inside template literals to insert the value of a variable. For example, if var word = such then `as ${word}` would equal 'as such'
* In [[ASP.NET]], the dollar sign used in a tag in the web page indicates an expression will follow it. The expression that follows is .NET [[language-independent specification|language-agnostic]], as it will work with c#, vb.net, or any CLR supported language.
* In [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]], the dollar sign precedes character literals. The dollar sign as a character can be written $$.
* In [[Cobol|COBOL]] the $ sign is used in the [[Picture clause]] to depict a floating currency symbol as the left most character. The default symbol is $ however if the CURRENCY= or CURRENCY SIGN clause is specified, any single symbol can be used.
* In some [[assembly language]]s like [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], the $ sign is used to represent registers.
* In [[Honeywell 6000 series]] assembler, the $ sign, when used as an address, meant the address of the instruction in which it appeared.
* In [[CMS-2 (programming language)#Program structure|CMS-2]], the $ sign is used as a statement terminator.
*In [[Q (programming language from Kx Systems)]], the $ sign is used as a casting/padding/enumeration/conditional operator.

===Operating systems===
* In [[CP/M]] and subsequently in all versions of [[DOS]] ([[86-DOS]], [[MS-DOS]], [[PC DOS]], more) and derivatives, $ is used as a string terminator (Int 21h with AH=09h).
** $ is used by the &lt;code&gt;prompt&lt;/code&gt; command to insert special sequences into the DOS command prompt string.
* In [[Microsoft Windows]], $ is appended to the share name to hide a shared folder or resource. For example, "\\server\share" will be visible to other computers on a network, while "\\server\share$" will be accessible only by explicit reference. Hiding a shared folder or resource will not alter its access permissions but may render it unaccessible to programs or other functions which rely on its visibility. Most [[administrative share]]s are hidden in this way.
* In [[Unix-like]] systems the $ is often part of the [[Command-line interface#Command prompt|command prompt]], depending on the user's [[shell (computing)|shell]] and environment settings. For example, the default environment settings for the [[bash (Unix shell)|bash]] shell specify $ as part of the command prompt.
*: The using [[history expansion]] &lt;code&gt;!$&lt;/code&gt; (same as &lt;code&gt;!!1$&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!-1$&lt;/code&gt;) means the last argument of the previous command in [[bash (Unix shell)|bash]]: &lt;code&gt;!-2$&lt;/code&gt; expands to the last argument of the penultimate command, &lt;code&gt;!5$&lt;/code&gt; expands into the last argument of the fifth command and so on. For example:
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;&gt; touch my_first_file
&gt; echo "This is my file." &gt; !$&lt;/source&gt;
:: where &lt;code&gt;!$&lt;/code&gt; expands into &lt;code&gt;my_first_file&lt;/code&gt;.
* In the [[LDAP]] directory access protocol, $ is used as a line separator in various standard entry attributes such as postalAddress.
* In the [[UNIVAC EXEC 8]] operating system, "$" meant "system."  It was appended to entities such as the names of system files, the "sender" name in messages sent by the operator, and the default names of system-created files (like compiler output) when no specific name was specified (e.g., TPF$, NAME$, etc.)
* In [[RISC OS]], $ is used in System Variables to separate the application name from the variables specific to that application - for example &lt;code&gt;Draw$Dir&lt;/code&gt; specifies the directory where the &lt;code&gt;!Draw&lt;/code&gt; application is located.  It is also used to refer to the [[root directory]] of a [[file system]].

===Applications===
* [[Microsoft Excel]]&lt;ref&gt;http://web.pdx.edu/~stipakb/CellRefs.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and other spreadsheet software use the dollar sign ($) to denote a fixed row, fixed column reference, or an absolute cell reference.
* $ matches the end of a line or string in [[sed]], [[grep]], and [[POSIX]] and [[Perl]] [[regular expression]]s, and, as a result:
* $ signifies the end of a line or the file in text editors [[ed (text editor)|ed]], [[ex (text editor)|ex]], [[vi]], [[pico (text editor)|pico]] and derivatives.

== Currencies that use the dollar or peso sign ==
{{Main|Dollar|Peso}}
In addition to those countries of the world that use [[Dollar#Economies that use a dollar|dollar]]s or [[Peso#Countries that use pesos|peso]]s, a number of other countries use the $ symbol to denote their currencies, including:
* [[Nicaraguan córdoba]] (usually written as C$)
* [[Samoan tālā]] (a transliteration of the word dollar)
* [[Tongan paʻanga]]

An exception is the [[Philippine peso]], whose sign is written as [[Philippine peso sign|₱]].

The dollar sign is also still sometimes used to represent the [[Malaysian ringgit]] (which replaced the local [[Malaya and British Borneo dollar|dollar]]), though its official use to represent the currency has been discontinued since 1993.

Some currencies use the ''[[cifrão]]'' ([[File:Cifrão symbol.svg|15px]]), similar to the dollar sign, but always with two strokes:

* [[Brazilian real]]
* [[Cape Verde escudo]]
* [[Portuguese escudo]] (defunct)

In Mexico and other peso-using countries, the cifrão is used as a dollar sign when a document uses both pesos and dollars at the same time, to avoid confusion, but when the dollar sign is used alone (not in conjunction with the cifrão), it is usually represented as US $ (United States dollars) or by its [[ISO 4217]] code "USD". Example: US $5 or 5 USD (five U.S. dollars).{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

However, in [[Argentina]], the $ sign is always used for pesos, and if they want to indicate dollars, they always write U$S 5 or US$5 (5 US dollars).

In the United States, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Pacific Island nations, and English-speaking Canada, the dollar or peso symbol precedes the number. Five dollars or pesos is written and printed as $5, whereas five cents is written as 5[[¢]]. In French-speaking Canada, the dollar symbol usually appears after the number ({{Not a typo|5$}}).

==Other uses==

The dollar sign introduces a subfield delimiter in [[MARC_standards|computer coding of library catalog records]].

Also, it is used derisively to indicate greed or excess money such as in "[[Microsoft|Micro$oft]]", "[[George Lucas|George Luca$]]", "[[Lars Ulrich|Lar$ Ulrich]]", "[[Disney|Di$ney]]", "[[Chelsea FC|Chel$ea]]" and "[[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GW$]]"; or supposed overt Americanization as in "[[British Sky Broadcasting|$ky]]". The dollar sign is also used intentionally to stylize names such as [[ASAP Rocky|A$AP Rocky]], [[Kesha|Ke$ha]] and [[Ty Dolla Sign|Ty Dolla $ign]] or words such as '''¥€$'''. In 1872, [[Ambrose Bierce]] referred to the California Governor as [[Leland Stanford|$tealand Landford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ambrose Bierce: Alone in Bad Company|author=Roy Morris|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1995|page=176|isbn=9780195126280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scrabble]] notation, a dollar sign is placed after a word to indicate that it is valid according to the [[Official Tournament and Club Word List|North American word lists]], but not according to the British word lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonscrabble.com/articles/glossary.html|title=Scrabble Glossary|publisher=Tucson Scrabble Club|accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Line-Up|publisher=[[Cavia (company)|Cavia Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second entry in the [[Drakengard|''Drakengard'' series]], set after the events of the original ''[[Drakengard (video game)|Drakengard]]'': the story revolves around Nowe, a boy raised by the dragon Legna, fighting against a tyrannical faction of knights, encountering characters from the previous game and becoming entangled in the fate of the world.

Like the original, ''Drakengard 2'' combines on-foot [[hack and slash]] with [[aerial combat]] stages and RPG game mechanics. The previous game's producer, writer and character designer returned to their respective roles. The game was designed as a more mainstream game in light of the previous game's dark aesthetic and story. The game sold 206,000 copies by the end of 2005. Western reviews praised the story, but gave mixed opinions about the graphics and widely criticized the gameplay. A spin-off from the series, ''[[Nier (video game)|Nier]]'', was released in 2010, while a third entry in the series, ''[[Drakengard 3]]'', was released in December 2013 in Japan and May 2014 in North America and Europe.

As with the original ''Drakengard'', the game is split into chapters and subdivided into ground-based and airborne missions.&lt;ref name= "DG2gameplay3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/drakengard-2-updated-hands-on/1100-6143672/|title=Drakengard 2 Updated Hands-On|author=Mueller, Greg|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2006-02-03|accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the game dictates which missions come when during the initial playthrough and how they play out, though as the player progresses, new remixed versions of the various playable levels called "free missions" are unlocked, which allow the player to go through the missions with the story elements removed. The player can jump between the game world's self-contained areas via a world map unlocked after the first chapter.&lt;ref name="DG2gameplay2"/&gt; In between the various chapters and missions, the player builds up their characters using experience points earned in battle: the characters' weapons and abilities, and the abilities of the player's dragon, can be gradually improved. The player's view of the world is through a fixed camera, which tracks the player's progress across the player area. Collectables in the form of weapons and items such as armor and health points and items needed to progress within the level are also available for the player to seek out.&lt;ref name="DG2gameplay1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/07/08/drakengard-2-update|title=Drakengard 2 Update|author=Gantayat, Anoop|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2005-07-07|accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features Normal, Hard, and Expert difficulty levels, and there are multiple weapons and items to collect throughout the levels.&lt;ref name= "IGNdg2"/&gt;

Combat in the game is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of missions beginning after an opening tutorial. The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial combat.&lt;ref name= "DG2gameplay3"/&gt; In ground combat, the player controls multiple characters, switching between them via the pause menu in order to use their different weapons. The characters use physical attacks using character weapons for short-range battle, while magical attacks are used for long-range attacks and groups of enemies.&lt;ref name= "DG2gameplay1"/&gt; The magical attacks vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap.&lt;ref name= "DG2gameplay3"/&gt;

Aerial gameplay puts the main character atop his dragon, which is guided round by the player to attack enemy formations and large structures on the ground or enemies and airships in the sky. The player can also jump between the dragon and the ground during ground-based missions.&lt;ref name= "DG2gameplay3"/&gt; The dragon has the ability to launch two types of fireballs: a homing variety that deals damage to single enemies, and a widespread attack which does higher damage to groups. Alongside this, the dragon can perform a special attack called "Dragon Overdrive", which kills many normal enemy units outright and deals high damage to stronger units and bosses.&lt;ref name="DG2gameplay2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2006/01/31/drakengard-2-north-american-impressions|title=Drakengard 2: North American Impressions|author=Roper, Chris|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-01-30|accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dragon also gains experience and levels up through combat, dealing more damage in its attacks as it grows stronger. It also evolves and grows stronger at points directly linked to the game's narrative.&lt;ref name= "DG2gameplay3"/&gt;

=== Setting and characters ===
''Drakengard 2'' takes place in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of ''Drakengard'': originally said to take place after the game's first ending, it was later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] so it took place in an isolated timeline following events similar to ''Drakengard''.&lt;ref name= "GSfirst"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ja:ドラッグ オン ドラグーン3 設定資料集＋ザ・コンプリートガイド |trans-title=Drag-On Dragoon 3 The Complete Guide + Settings |publisher=[[ASCII Media Works]] |location=Tokyo |isbn=9784048660860 |language=Japanese | pages=180–181 |date=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, were engaged in a religious war over the Seals, magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a [[dragon]] who had made a pact (a magical ritual that linked their souls), and fought to try to keep both the Seals and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world.&lt;ref name= "GSfirst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/drakengard-ii-import-hands-on/1100-6129517/|title=Drakengard II Import Hands-On|author=Torres, Ricardo|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2005-06-20|accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen years later, the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEseals"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Opening|level=|quote='''Narrator''': Five seals hold in place the red dragon, the last bastion against world destruction.

=== Plot ===
The game begins with Nowe becoming a fully-fledged Knight of the Seal. During his first mission, Nowe begins to doubt the ethics of the Knights' methods, as the seals require human sacrifices to remain strong.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEdoubt"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Verse 3|level=Chapter 1|quote='''Eris''': Nowe! Don't be a fool! They are the chosen ones, proud martyrs... / '''Nowe''': They're not proud martyrs! Look how terrified they are! The knights are just forcing the weak and dispossessed to be sacrificial victims! }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a second mission to ensure the protection of the seal in the District of Soul Flame, Nowe encounters Manah, who kills the guardian Zhangpo and destroys the seal. Manah is sentenced to be [[Death by burning|burnt at the stake]], but uses her magic to escape. After returning from the mission, Nowe is poisoned by Gismor, who reveals to have killed Nowe's adoptive father Oror.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEpoisoned"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Verse 1|level=Chapter 3|quote='''Gismor''': Yes, three years ago, I gave the same drink to Oror, before he left to head the defense. He drank it all down without hesitation, just like you. / '''Nowe''': Wh-? My eyes...I can't see... You have poisoned me! }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving and escaping with Legna, Nowe is pursued by the Knights, including Eris, who wishes to persuade him to return. Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and, in her mind, free the people from the Knights' oppression. On their way to the second seal, Manah shows Nowe the true horror of the Knights' oppression, fully winning him over.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEtruth"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Verse 5|level=Chapter 4|quote='''Manah''': Now do you see, Nowe? How they suffer? They have nothing to eat. They're starving to death... But they cannot leave. If they do try, the Knights punish them. But staying here means that they weaken and die, one by one. / '''Nowe''': Hell for them if they stay, and hell if they flee. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two then fight and kill Lieutenant Hanch, destroying the seal in the District of Hallowed Water. After this, they are joined by Urick, a former Lieutenant of the Knights, to rout a group of bandits. Attacked by the Knights, they are unexpectedly saved by Caim, who is also working to destroy the seals and free his dragon Angelus from the pain of being the Goddess Seal. After taking down Lieutenant Yaha and destroying the seal in the District of Precious Light, Manah is captured by the Knights and sentenced to death. Nowe manages to rescue her and heads for the seal in the District of Shining Life, which was once guarded by Urick before he fled in fear when Caim attacked the district.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEreturn"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Verse 9|level=Chapter 7|quote='''Manah''': You're the missing lieutenant, and the guardian of the key to the District of Shining Life. Isn't that so, Urick? [...] / '''Urick''': I'm just a coward. During the attack on the seal three years ago, I was defeated by Caim. General Oror saved me. I left him to die, and ran away. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urick and Nowe face off against Caim, who mortally wounds Urick before being driven off. Urick dies content and the seal is destroyed.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEurickdeath"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Verse 9|level=Chapter 7|quote='''Nowe''': Urick! No! Don't go! Urick! / '''Urick''': You ask too much of me... If we live long enough to atone for our sins, we've lived long enough. I've lived... too long... I'll be training with General Oror in the afterlife... See you around... kid. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowe and Manah head for the final seal in the District of Heavenly Time, guarded by Gismor himself. Nowe and Gismor battle, and Gismor is wounded again, transforming into a shadow-like being and using Eris to block Nowe's final attack. Believing Eris dead, Nowe and Manah pursue Gismore, but are met by Seere, who unsuccessfully tries to stop them. When they confront Gismor, he reveals himself to be a vindictive survivor of the Empire from eighteen years before.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEgismore"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Verse 4|level=Chapter 8|quote='''Gismor''': What do you know of suffering? Of humiliation? Have you ever slept on cold earth? Eaten dirt to stave off hunger? You were blessed with powers by birth. You cannot understand or even imagine the suffering I endured as a survivor of the Empire. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Defeated, Gismor destroys the final seal himself, releasing Angelus from her imprisonment. After Seere reveals the true consequences of Manah's actions, Nowe and Legna pursue Angelus. When they find her, they find that Angelus has been driven mad by the pain of being the final seal.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEangelus1"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Verse 1|level=Chapter 9|quote='''Nowe''': Legna! What is the red dragon saying? I can't tell! / '''Legna''': I cannot tell, either. It's an explosion of rage...

We're together now. }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the seals destroyed, the world begins to fall into chaos and Manah is driven mad by the memories of her actions eighteen years before. Legna then takes Nowe to the fortress of the holy dragons, where they hear a prophecy concerning Nowe: according to the prophecy, Nowe is a New Breed created to aid the dragons in their war against the Watchers. Nowe then reunites with Eris, who had been healed by Seere, and frees Manah from her madness. Legna then takes the three to the Promised Land, a dragon stronghold that holds the Bone Casket, an object given to the dragons by and imbued with the power of the Watchers that can speed up Nowe's evolution into the New Breed. It is also where Seere has gone to initiate a new Goddess of the Seal.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEpromisedland"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Verse 1|level=Chapter 12|quote='''Nowe''': What's in the Promised Land? What would Hierarch Seere be doing there? / '''Eris''': He'll perform the sealing ceremony, and restore order to the world. / '''Nowe''': Hierarch Seere found a goddess? [...] / '''Eris''': Yes, the red dragon replaced the last goddess. Now that the dragon is dead, a new goddess is to be born...or so I hear. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has three endings, each achieved on a separate playthrough.&lt;ref name= "VGdg2"/&gt;

*'''Ending A''': The group arrive in the Promised Land and Legna prepares to enact the prophecy, but Nowe instead chooses to find a new Goddess. Legna calls the Holy Dragons to battle, but Seere leads an army of Golems against them. With everything seeming lost, Manah and Nowe share a final kiss, which triggers Nowe's transformation into the New Breed. Nowe and Legna do battle, and Legna is killed. Eris then reveals that she is to become the new Goddess. Eris is initiated, and although the world is restored, Nowe and Manah feel sad that no other solution could be found.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEend1"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Ending A|chapter=Chapter 12|quote='''Manah''': Nowe, I cannot believe in a peace achieved by one woman's sacrifice. / '''Nowe''': I know. But you also know that we have no other choice. / '''Manah''': Yes. [...] I'll wait for the day when Eris can lead the life of an ordinary woman again. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending B''': When they arrive, Legna reveals Eris' fate to become the new Goddess and Nowe chooses to follow Legna's plan. But upon trying to enter the Casket, it rejects him and fuses with Manah. Legna and Nowe battle Manah, who sacrifices herself to destroy the Bone Casket's power. Nowe, Legna and Eris then lead the Holy Dragons in their war against the Watchers.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEend2"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Ending B|chapter=Chapter 12|quote='''Eris''': The dragons never forgot their history. They lived to honor it. Now, they are about to surpass the Gods, with the New Breed as their weapon. / '''Nowe''': If the world is truly to be free from the law of the Gods, I shall become a weapon. / '''Eris''': Do you think that's what Manah would have wanted? I don't suppose we'll ever knew. All we have left is war, and the desolation it leaves in its wake. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending C''': Events proceed as in Ending B, but when the Casket attacks Manah, she manages to win the fight against it. Legna summons the Holy Dragons and events proceed as in Ending A. After Legna's defeat and the destruction of the Bone Casket, both the Watchers and the dragons fade, leaving the world safe and humans free to create a new future for themselves.&lt;ref name= "QUOTEend3"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Drakengard 2 |developer=Cavia |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2006-02-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|scene=Ending C|chapter=Chapter 12|quote='''Seere''': The other dragons are fading. / '''Eris''': I...I no longer need to become a Goddess. / '''Manah''': No more dragons or gods. This is the beginning of a new world. [...] / '''Seere''': At last, the fate of humanity rests in human hands. It's up to us to create a paradise, or a hell. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Drakengard 2'' was announced in December 2004.&lt;ref name= "DOD2announced"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2004/12/16/drakengard-sequel|title=Drakengard Sequel|author=Gantayat, Anoop|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-12-15|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Takamasa Shiba and character designer Kimihiko Fujisaka returned to the team,&lt;ref name= "famitsu2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201309/02039188.html|title=『ドラッグ オン ドラグーン3』キャラデザ担当の藤坂公彦氏と柴貴正Pのロングインタビューをお届け|publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|date=2013-09-02|accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside actor [[Peter (actor)|Shinnosuke Ikehata]], who voiced the dragon Angelus and its partner Caim in the previous game.&lt;ref name= "famitsu1"/&gt; The original director, [[Yoko Taro]], originally proposed a space adventure involving dragons, but this was vetoed at an early stage. Yoko was not involved in creating the narrative as he had been in ''Drakengard'', being mostly tied up with another project, though he was able to observe the project's progress. He and ''Drakengard 2''{{'}}s director Akira Yasui suffered from creative differences, with the result that Yoko termed their relationship on the project as a "love-hate" story in a 2013 interview concerning the series. Their relationship inspired one of the stories created for an in-game weapon. Yoko was eventually brought on fairly late in the game's production to act as video editor for the CGI cutscenes and trailers.&lt;ref name="DOD2comments"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/games/ps2/dod2/staff.html|title=Drag-On Dragoon 2: Staff Comment|publisher=Drag-On Dragoon 2 Website|date=2005-05-27|accessdate=2015-06-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604081942/http://www.square-enix.co.jp/games/ps2/dod2/staff.html|archivedate=2009-06-04|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "DengYasui"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/623/623508/|script-title=ja:『ドラッグ オン ドラグーン』シリーズ座談会、佳境へ。ヨコオタロウが暴く『DOD2』安井ディレクターの心の闇＆『ニーア』反省話|publisher=''[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]]''|date=2013-04-22|accessdate=2014-03-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230018/http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/623/623508/|archivedate=2016-03-03|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's cast featured multiple film and television actors, including [[Ryo Katsuji]], [[Saki Aibu]], [[Koyuki]] and veteran actor [[Yoshio Harada]].&lt;ref name= "DengActors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/data/news/2005/2/16/7d891531336e2580d2873c72313e8cc8.html|title=前作に続き『ドラッグオンドラグーン2』も豪華キャスト！ピーター、小雪らが出演|publisher=[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]]|date=2005-02-16|accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiba commented at the time that he felt they had gathered a very good voice cast for the game.&lt;ref name= "DengShiba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/data/news/2005/6/2/58b02b8855179fb896d3d9c8c0e2737d.html|title=小雪さんやピーターさんも駆けつけた！『ドラッグオンドラグーン2』完成披露会|publisher=''[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]]''|date=2005-06-02|accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the decisions Yasui made was to make ''Drakengard 2'' far more colorful than the previous game, wanting to do something that was the "opposite" of ''Drakengard''.&lt;ref name= "DengYasui"/&gt; In contrast to the previous game, the game contained far less of the mature themes found in the original. Shiba, speaking in a 2013 interview, said that the reason for this was that [[Square Enix]], the company's Japanese publisher, wanted that aspect toned down to make a more mainstream game.&lt;ref name= "ShackShiba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/81558/drakengard-3-trying-to-avoid-formulaic-jrpg-tropes-with-its|title=Drakengard 3 trying to avoid 'formulaic' JRPG tropes with its dark setting|author=Yoon, Andrew|publisher=[[Shacknews]]|date=2013-10-18|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to keep some dark aesthetics from its predecessor, with the previous game's theme of immorality as one of the key character and narrative themes, as well as themes of war and death. Other themes explored were love and hate, and the ambivalence represented in the world's prevalent factions (the Knights of the Seal, and the Cult of Watchers).

===Character design===
One of the main concepts for main protagonist Nowe was surpassing one's father. For the fight between Nowe and Legna, special gameplay functions and mechanics needed to be created for Nowe.&lt;ref name="DengDODdesigns2"/&gt; Shiba had mixed feelings about the final fight between Legna and Nowe, which he saw as a drastic change from both the first game and the series mechanic of the protagonist riding a dragon. Shiba ended up writing their dialogue to emphasize their relationship and the difficulty of them fighting each other, paralleling earlier scenes between Caim and Angelus.&lt;ref name="DengDODdesigns2"/&gt; The deaths of Caim and Angelus was intended to be "short and ruthless", but Yasui had it changed to the more sentimental version present in the game. Dialogue from Caim for the scene was cut from the game due to it clashing with his previous portrayal as a mute.&lt;ref name="DengDODdesigns3"/&gt; Urick was created to be the supportive "big brother" of the party.&lt;ref name="DengDODdesigns1"/&gt;

Although the main characters were designed by Fujisaka, the character Legna, previously known as the "Black Dragon", was designed by Taro Hasegawa, who was also monster designer for both ''Drakengard'' and ''Drakengard 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:ドラッグオンドラグーン2 設定資料集|trans-title=Drag-On Dragoon 2: Memory of Blood |publisher=[[Square Enix]] |isbn=4-7575-1516-2|language=Japanese |date=2005-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to designing the characters, Fujisaka drew the character portraits used for character dialogue boxes during in-game cutscenes, a feature he initially objected to.&lt;ref name="DOD2comments"/&gt; Nowe, in contrast to the other protagonists of the ''Drakengard'' series, was designed around the concept of a stereotypical hero. Nowe was one of Fujisaka's favorite characters to design, although Shiba was less enthusiastic. Manah's redesign in ''Drakengard 2'' reflected both her evolved personality and her more traditional depiction as a fantasy heroine.&lt;ref name="DengDODdesigns2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/647/647513/|script-title=ja:『ドラッグ オン ドラグーン（DOD）』シリーズの裏話を柴プロデューサーが暴露!? 『DOD3』の使徒のデザイン秘話も掲載|publisher=''[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]]''|date=2013-06-19|accessdate=2014-11-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317000330/http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/647/647513/|archivedate=2015-03-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DengDODdesigns1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/647/647512/|script-title=ja:『ドラッグ オン ドラグーン（DOD）』シリーズ居酒屋座談会、再び。柴プロデューサーと藤坂さんがヨコオタロウに物申す!?|publisher=''[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]]''|date=2013-06-17|accessdate=2014-11-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231051/http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/647/647512/|archivedate=2016-03-03|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of their designs were taken from Caim and Furiae, representing "passing the torch" between characters.&lt;ref name="DengDODdesigns3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/647/647514/|script-title=ja:『ドラッグ オン ドラグーン（DOD）』シリーズのキャラ人気投票結果を開発者が総括！ カイムとアンヘルのラストにまつわる秘話とは？|publisher=''[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]]''|date=2013-06-21|accessdate=2014-01-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225619/http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/647/647514/|archivedate=2016-03-03|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Legna's different roles in ''Drakengard'' and ''Drakengard 2'', his design and movements were altered for his second incarnation. Eris's design was inspired by [[List of Berserk characters#Casca|Casca]], a character from ''Berserk'': while he tried not to copy any parts of Casca's design, Fujisaka tried to convey it using aspects of her personality. He also tried to balance this part of her depiction with a tender and more feminine side. Another idea he had in mind was the image of an honors student. Her dance-like fighting style was generally suggested by the game's staff.&lt;ref name="DengDODdesigns2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DengDODdesigns1"/&gt; Caim's redesign was meant to represent his status as a wanderer.&lt;ref name="DengDODdesigns3"/&gt;

''Drakengard 2'' sold well in Japan.

The story received mixed to positive reviews. [[IGN]]'s Ed Lewis said it "admirably [continued] the bizarre and fantastically medieval world that was established in the original game.",&lt;ref name= "IGNdg2"/&gt; while [[GameSpot]]'s Greg Meuller called it "Interesting [...] with plenty of twists and turns".&lt;ref name= "GSdg2"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Simon Parkin cited the story as being very good, though he found Nowe "a little nauseating to watch as the weighty, dark (and pretty good) plot unfolds",&lt;ref name= "EuGdg2"/&gt; and VideoGamer.com's Adam Jarvis called the story "one of the highlights of the package".&lt;ref name= "VGdg2"/&gt; The [[1Up.com|1UP]] reviewer called the "clear undercurrent of "maybe the good guys are the bad guys,"" one of the main reasons to keep playing the game.&lt;ref name= "1UPdg2"/&gt; In contrast, the reviewer for [[GameTrailers]] called it "a cookie-cutter RPG plot" where players could "predict nearly every plot twist the game throws at [them].",&lt;ref name= "GTdg2"/&gt;

The graphics received mixed reviews. Lewis called them "more interesting than the first game, but marginally so",&lt;ref name= "IGNdg2"/&gt; and Meuller called them "dated", with environments seeming "bland and drab, and the enemies [looking] generic".&lt;ref name= "GSdg2"/&gt; The GameTrailers reviewer praised the character animations, but cited the environments as bland and felt that there were too few FMVs and too many game engine-driven cutscenes, which he described as "awful".&lt;ref name= "GTdg2"/&gt; Parkin criticized the game's graphic capacities, commenting that players would "stop watching the main screen instead fixing upon the little map in the corner to guide your character towards hostile red dots that only materialize polygonal just seconds before you lock swords.",&lt;ref name= "EuGdg2"/&gt; while Jarvis said that it had not improved from the previous game and called the colors "very murky, drab and dark".&lt;ref name= "VGdg2"/&gt; 1UP said that the graphics "[don't] hold up to the visual quality of Cavia's other titles like ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' [or] ''[[Naruto: Uzumaki Ninden]]''".&lt;ref name= "1UPdg2"/&gt;

The gameplay was universally criticized. Parkin called the battle gameplay "lightweight" and the balance between ground and aerial combat poor despite a good character leveling system,&lt;ref name= "EuGdg2"/&gt; while Lewis described it as being without strategy, with the game "just dumping in more boring enemies to wade through".&lt;ref name= "IGNdg2"/&gt; GameTrailers said that there was "nothing new here.",&lt;ref name= "GTdg2"/&gt; while Meuller called it "dull at best and frustrating at worst".&lt;ref name= "GSdg2"/&gt; 1UP said that the combat was "almost sickening to look at.", though he cited the RPG elements as a redeeming feature.&lt;ref name= "1UPdg2"/&gt; Jarvis simply called the gameplay "Same old, same old", citing it as a major fault of the game.&lt;ref name= "VGdg2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3270">'''EU Talent Day''' is an observance of the [[European Union]] on [[Béla Bartók]]'s birthday who was a well-known composer in and outside of [[Europe]].

== History ==

The first European TalentDay was held on April 9, 2011. This coincided with the Hungarian [[EU Presidency|EU Presidential Conference]] on Talent Support, held in [[Budapest]] on April 7–9, 2011. Conference delegates proposed March 25, birthday of Béla Bartók, as EU TalentDay. This event,&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian EU Presidential Conference on Talent Support ; [BUDAPEST DECLARATION ON TALENT SUPPORT http://talentday.eu/content/budapest-declaration-talent-support] (April 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; written on the first EU TalentDay, includes the following points about the purpose of [[aptitude|talent]] development in the [[European Union]] and of EU TalentDay:

*Talent development has beneficial effects on the economies of individual nations, and of the European Union as a whole. 
*Talent support programmes may boost the self-esteem and social success of talented people.
*Talent support is becoming important in the social-economic progress of underprivileged people groups.
*Effective networking of groups facilitating talent development, as is now happening in Hungary, will be even more beneficial once extended across Europe.
*EU TalentDay can help to focus the attention of stakeholders and the European general public, and seeks recognition of talents support benefits and of best practices by the [[European Commission]], the [[European Council]] and the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;The final Written Declaration on the importance of talent support http://www.talentcentrebudapest.eu/content/wd-342012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Euro-Sinica''''' is a scholarly series, published by the European academic publisher [[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]]. The series focuses primarily on intercultural and transcultural studies, including intellectual history, of Europe and China.

The monograph series was founded by Adrian Hsia, of [[McGill University]], following the first Sino-German symposium on intercultural relations immediately after the opening of China subsequent to the Cultural Revolution. The symposium was co-organized by Hsia and Professor Guenther Debon, University of Heidelberg, and its proceedings entitled ''Goethe und China, China und Goethe'' (1985) were published as volume one of the series. Later on, the prominent Chinese novelist and scholar [[Qian Zhongshu]] wrote the Chinese title of Euro-Sinica in his beautiful calligraphy which constitutes a part of the book cover since volume three. So far, twelve volumes have been published in English, French, and German, covering the three domains mentioned above.

In this series of intellectual probings, the terms "Europe" and "China" are not to be understood geo-politically, but rather culturally. Wherever a European language is used as the official language, such a country is considered to belong to the European cultural group. In a similar vein, wherever Chinese ideograms are used and the tenets of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese Buddhism]] are followed, these countries are regarded as the Sinic group. Studies on both cultural groups are also included in the monograph series. The third domain of Euro-Sinica constitutes analyses of ethnic Chinese artists and thinkers living in the West.

==Production==
''Extremis'' was the second story arc after the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" crossover event, not to be confused with "[[The Invincible Iron Man#"Stark: Disassembled" (#20-24)|Stark: Disassembled]]", a later story in ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]''.

The story was meant as a sort of "new start" for the character—to redefine him from his origins as an arms dealer, to be the "test pilot for the future" Ellis intended him to be. The story rarely mentions any of Iron Man's past, and references to the rest of the Marvel universe are limited to brief, passing mentions of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Fin Fang Foom]]. Warren Ellis admitted he had intentionally not read any Iron Man material besides the very earliest issues.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

This is similar for Adi Granov: "My first official introduction to the character occurred a year prior to ''Extremis''. [...] Upon reading the script, I realized how realistic Warren's approach was to the story. [...] When illustrating the book I wanted my art to mirror the realism in Warren's writing [...] I felt that Warren wrote a story that's a sort of techno-thriller action story and I wanted the art to reflect this. [...] I saw Iron Man as not just a superhero in a suit; rather he is a pilot or weapon. To me, the Iron Man armor is more akin to a jet fighter than it is to an outfit.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man: Extremis Director's Cut'' #1, Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

The story, which lasts about three to four days in comic book time, takes place at an undefined time after the [[The New Avengers (comics)#Volume 1 (2005–2010)|founding of the New Avengers]] and before the [[Nitro (comics)#Stamford catastrophe|Stamford catastrophe]] (which led to the Marvel [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]).

==Story==
{{plot|section|date=February 2016}}
Tony Stark is a weapons designer whose weapons are being used against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in the years just prior to the second Gulf War. He is injured during an inspection tour when one of his own bombs detonates, sending a piece of shrapnel into his chest, and is captured by Afghan terrorists.  As in the original origin story, Tony creates his first suit of armor with Ho Yinsen and escapes the terrorists, with Yinsen killed during the escape (noted by Tony to be due to a single stray bullet).

Three men enter a disused slaughterhouse in Texas, where two of them inject a willing third, whom they call "Mallen." This injection contains an experimental drug which makes him fall to the floor in immense pain. A bizarre physical change overtakes him; his horrified compatriots flee the room, but lock him in it.

Miles underground in his Coney Island "garage" , Stark is awakened from sleep and several weeks of work, isolation, and diminished self care by his secretary's phone call, reminding him of a scheduled interview with a journalist. During the interview, the journalist discovers that Stark is most regretful that the world-changing, humanitarian improvements he had hoped to fund with his weapons sales have not yet materialized. Confronted by his regrets, Stark returns to the garage, takes stock of himself while realizing that the Iron Man is likely his key to a better future for both himself and humanity. Having canceled all appointments, Tony Stark dons the newest version of the Iron Man armor and takes off into the sky.

Meanwhile, the injected man's body, still lying in the Bastrop warehouse, is now covered completely in a bizarre layer of scar tissue.

Later, at Futurepharm Corporation offices in Austin, Texas, Dr. Aldrich Killian commits suicide after typing and printing his confession. The note informs co-worker Maya Hansen that he has stolen and "loosed" the company's dangerous Extremis serum for some "greater" purpose. Hansen calls Tony Stark, whom she met years ago at a meeting of the minds.

Back in the Texas slaughterhouse, the two men return to find Mallen almost completely recovered in appearance. He is alive, having almost punched through the locked metal door.

Stark arrives in Texas in the middle of a teleconference with his board of directors, rejecting their requests that he resign as CEO of his company and take a head technician title instead. Tony also argues that Stark Industries, having invented a revolutionary cell phone and connection method, no longer needs the government's funding. The conference ends at a crossroad. Arriving at Futurepharm, Stark learns that the intended receiver of the Extremis dose is currently unknown due to an inability to hack Killian's computer. Using Stark Industry's new prototype phone, Tony emails Killian's entire hard drive to be hacked by one of his employees, and, to distract Maya, jets her and himself to San Diego to talk with their old friend and teacher, Sal Kennedy.

Meanwhile, the three men from the slaughterhouse arrive at the FBI field office. While Kennedy, now a futurist following nature and an idealistic way of life, harangues Tony and Maya on their military work and thus-far-failed promise, Mallen sets the FBI office on fire using his new biological powers.  Maya catches the story on the news, realizing that the terrorists are in fact using Extremis and causing casualties of over 50 civilians.  Back in the van, Mallen tells his confederates that he is only getting started.

In flight back to Texas, Maya tells Stark Extremis is a military nanotechnology serum that was another attempt to recreate the [[Captain America]] Super-Soldier Serum, and that the new formula interfaces with the brain's 'repair center' and directs the body to rebuild itself from scratch as if it were all wound tissue to be replaced. Stark receives a call from his employee, which reveals that Killian gave Extremis to local terrorists. Realizing the threat, Tony drops Maya off at Futurepharm, and departs.

Iron Man tracks the terrorists' van from above via body heat scans and tears it in half with a non-lethal repulsor ray. Mallen instantly recovers, and after refusing to surrender peacefully, engages Iron Man in a brutal fight. Throughout the battle, it becomes obvious that Mallen's new abilities far surpass the processing speed and durability  of Iron Man's armor. Suffering severe injuries and damage to his armor, Iron Man and the police manage to repulse Mallen, though civilian casualties are present. Mallen flees, leaving Stark trapped beneath a burning car with his armor at zero power. Stark saves himself and the car's passengers by raising his armor to 1% power by drawing from the flames' thermal energy, though he is forced to rely on the police to remove the car from atop his body.

Iron Man calls Maya and has her people fly him to Futurepharm, where, in a private medical bay, he reveals himself as Tony Stark to Maya. Knowing the severity of his injuries, Tony realizes the only way for him to survive and defeat Mallen is to become one with the Iron Man by taking the Extremis serum himself. Maya gives Tony a lower dose of the serum that will not alter his mind and body as it did for Mallen.  Unknown to Maya, Tony had altered the structure of the Extremis dose, removing several safeties and linking himself to his armor and machinery. Tony falls into a coma as a cocoon forms around his body.

While unconscious, Stark relives his story as Iron Man, starting with his first mortal injury and the secrets he revealed to Yinsen while they constructed the original Arc Reactor (used to still the shrapnel lodged in Stark's chest and prevent it from puncturing his heart) and Iron Man suit (something powered by the same thing keeping him alive that would allow for the two of them to escape their captors). Tony confesses that the terrorists could not be allowed to use his weapons, and that his Military contracts were nothing more than "stealing money from the government" to fund something that would better all of mankind and bring a better future; the Iron Man idea was never a weapon of war, but the start of a process that would merge men with machines and make humanity great.

Twenty-four hours into his coma, the cocoon which has covered his body bursts; Stark awakens, healed and newly fit. An internal control sheath for his Iron Man armor is now contained within the hollows of his bones, able to emerge upon mental command. He can integrate himself not only into his armor, but phone, computer, and even satellite networks. Maya confronts Tony on the potential strain his organs will suffer, only to find that the Extremis formula allowed him to grow entirely new organs. Using an older version of the Iron Man suit stored in a suit case, Tony explains that the autonomous armor was the way of the future, though its low processing speed made it useless until now.

Tapping into a satellite cluster, Iron Man finds Mallen heading towards Washington, intent on killing the president. Having the police evacuate the city, Iron Man confronts Mallen. During the fight, Iron Man reveals several aspects of his past, saying that he was forced to kill nearly 50 people in order to escape the terrorists and save himself and his friend, only to witness a stray bullet kill Yinsen on impact. Mallen replies that his parents died the same way. Tony points out that when Mallen killed 50 people, he did so with no knowledge of who or what they were, and did so twenty years after the fact. Now superior to Mallen, Iron Man explains that he had to be the one to stop the terrorist, seeing Mallen as a perversion of himself: a man with power but no concern for or ability to see the future. In the end, Mallen refuses to listen, pins Stark to the ground, and violently declares, "There isn't any future. I'm gonna kill it!" Seeing the horror before him, Stark fires his unibeam, piercing Mallen's chest and tearing his organs apart. Enraged by the man's refusal to give up, as well as his contempt for all life, Iron Man grabs Mallen's head with both hands and blows it off with a double blast of his repulsor rays. Attempting to recover, Mallen's body rises onto its knees, only to collapse lifeless on the ground. Furious, Iron Man condemns Mallen for what he made him do. Recovering from the incident, Stark declares that he has one last thing to do: the worst part yet.

Confronting Maya at Futurepharm, Iron Man reveals that Maya was clearly Killian's accomplice, due to the issue of needing two key cards entered at the same time as well as her extensive involvement with the formula. Maya allows herself to be taken away, though she justifies her actions by comparing the Extremis serum to the Atom Bomb, saying, "It had to be used once in anger so that it would never be used in anger again."  Maya then declares that Tony is no better than she is, to which Iron Man replies, "No. But I'm trying to be... And tomorrow I'll be able to look myself in the mirror."

==The Extremis virus==
Extremis is referred to as a "virus" throughout the story. The verbatim description offered by its inventor Maya Hansen, goes: "...Extremis is a super-soldier solution. It's a bio-electronics package, fitted into a few billion graphite [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]] and suspended in a carrier fluid. A magic bullet, like the original super-soldier serum—all fitted into a single injection. It hacks the body's repair center—the part of the brain that keeps a complete blue print of the human body. When we're injured, we refer to that area of the brain to heal properly. Extremis rewrites the repair center. In the first stage, the body essentially becomes an open wound. The normal human blueprint is being replaced with the Extremis blueprint. The brain is being told the body is wrong. Extremis protocol dictates that the subject be placed on life support and intravenously fed nutrients at this point. For the next two or three days, the patient remains unconscious within a cocoon of scabs. (...) Extremis uses the nutrients and body mass to grow new organs. Better ones..."&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' vol.4 #3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effects of the Extremis process, apart from the changes specific to Tony Stark, included: greatly accelerated healing; immensely-boosted immune system; generation of "new, improved organs" (Tony's cardiovascular and respiratory systems were greatly upgraded); and, the side effect of increased aggressiveness.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' vol.4 #9. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Stark had the super-powers removed from the Extremis compiler, though, effectively 'exchanging' them for the ability to interface directly with machines and his own armor; but, Mallen retained said super-powers, resulting in his high-level super-strength, super-speed, advanced invulnerability, and the abilities to breathe fire and project arcs of electricity from his hands, as well as being bullet-proof.{{issue|date=April 2012}}

As well as the obvious physical changes, Extremis also affected Stark mentally, allowing him to process information extraordinarily quickly, on a subconscious level, to help him better cope with the direct technological link he now possessed to his armor (even as his standard thought processes remained at a human norm). As a result, his brain, taking in more information than he could consciously process, began to sublimate it into his unconscious mind, causing Stark to experience occasional hallucinations of particularly relevant information, manifesting as people whose deaths he felt personally responsible for—such as [[Captain America]] or [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]]—making him aware of facts that he had noted subconsciously while not recognizing their relevance or existence on a conscious level (such as that a member of the Initiative had lied about his powers or that Maya Hansen was actually alive after her death was faked). [[Doc Samson]] speculated that the hallucinations appeared because the excess information was filtered into the same place Stark subconsciously stored his guilt to stop himself facing it.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' vol.4 #25. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] attempts to release Extremis on a large scale as part of his plan to 'reshape' the human race, it is revealed that Extremis can only be successful when used on people who possess a rare genetic sequence, found in only 2.5% of the human population. This percentage includes Tony Stark and Maya Hansen, but does not include the Mandarin. Anyone without this sequence who is exposed to Extremis will be killed by it.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' vol.4 #24. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

When industrialist Michael Hall attempts to create his own suits of armor based on the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], Iron Man attempts to hack the suits, but Carnage is able to 'hack' Iron Man in return by using the technological/biological interface elements of Extremis.&lt;ref&gt;''Carnage'' #5. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
During the 2010 "Stark: Disassembled" storyline, Tony is forced to erase portions of his memory in order to prevent [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] from gaining access to the list of people registered under the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. These actions resulted in his falling into a persistent vegetative state, in which his brain is unable to even regulate the autonomic functions of his body. During this period, Stark's colleagues play a recorded holographic message from Tony, which reveal that when the extraterrestrial [[Skrull]]s invaded Earth during the 2008 "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, they attacked Tony's Extremis, permanently shutting it down.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matt Fraction]] (w), [[Salvador Larocca]] (a). "Stark: Disassembled Part 2: Digging in the Dirt" ''The Invincible Iron Man'' #21 (February 2010), Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Stark's mind is "[[reboot (computing)|reboot]]ed" using information that he had saved when he first injected himself with Extremis, with the result that he loses all memory of the actions he had committed after receiving the Extremis upgrade, although he has spent time researching his activities between then and his restoration. Tony later discovers that his brain still has access to Extremis, which he began using again.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Fraction (w), Salvador Larocca (a). "Stark Resilient Part 1: Hammer Girls" ''The Invincible Iron Man'' #25 (August 2010), Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 "Believe" story arc, Tony learns that Maya Hansen has been killed and various new versions of Extremis have been released onto the black market, prompting him to track them down and eliminate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Gillen, Kieron]]|penciller=[[Land, Greg]]|inker=Leisten, Jay|story=Believe: 1 of 5: Demons and Genies|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=1|volume=6|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Extremis virus is then remade by Tony's long-lost foster brother, [[Iron Man 2020#Earth-616|Arno Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #26. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] is shot in the head by the Ancient Order of the Shield, with his usual healing factor making an erratic job of reconstructing Banner's mind even if it can repair the physical damage, Stark is able to use Extremis to heal the damage to Banner's brain and restore him to full mental health without any of the usual side effects or powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Waid, Mark]] (w), [[Bagley, Mark]] (p), Hennessy, Andrew (i). ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'' vol. 3 #4 (September 2014) Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 2014 "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]" storyline, when exposure to [[Uatu]]'s eye after [[Original Sin (comics)|his murder]]&lt;ref&gt;Aaron, Jason (w), Deodato, Mike (a). ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'' #3 (August 2014).

"Hulk vs. Iron Man" ''Original Sin'' #3.1 (August 2014). Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Banner uses a modified Extremis to trigger his transformation into the Hulk while retaining his intellect to ensure his revenge on Stark.&lt;ref&gt;Gillen Kieron; Waid, Mark (w), [[Ross, Luke]] (a). "Hulk vs. Iron Man Part 2" ''Original Sin'' #3.2 (September 2014). Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the two recognize that Tony's actions actually saved Bruce's life, Bruce modifies Extremis to modify his usual transformation, creating a new Hulk persona known as "Doc Green" (a form of Hulk that is similar to Bruce Banner's Merged Hulk form) who retains Bruce's intellect and the Hulk's strength.&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' vol. 3 #5 (August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; After Doc Green attacked and depowered other gamma mutants as he believed that they were a threat, the Hulk then asked [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] for help to remove the physical components of the Extremis virus from his brain, eliminating a tumour that may have killed him but furthering Doc Green's development into what appears to be a contemporary incarnation of the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' vol. 3 #9 (December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Doc Green eventually realised that his current state was only temporary and he would eventually return to normal, but an A.I. he created to facilitate his efforts at finding a cure has begun to work against him by using more Maestro-esque tactics,&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' vol. 3 #12&lt;/ref&gt; with Doc Green declining the option of a new Extremis upgrade for fear of becoming a new Maestro.&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' vol. 3 #16&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2014 "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, Tony Stark experienced a moral inversion due to the [[Scarlet Witch]] making a mistake while trying to bring out [[Professor X]] in the new [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]], he experienced a new surge of his more negative traits such as his ego, irresponsibility, and alcoholism, culminating in him releasing a new version of Extremis onto San Francisco. This new version, known as the Extremis 3.0 [[mobile app|app]], could offer beauty, health or even immortality for free, but Tony subsequently ended the free trial mode and started charging the app in a daily fee basis, making the citizens desperate, prompting [[Pepper Potts]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and the artificial intelligence of old Iron Man armor to make plans to stop him, based on Tony's past requests that his allies be prepared if he should ever cross a line.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Iron Man'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; During the fight between Daredevil and Iron Man, Extremis is used by Iron Man to "infect" Daredevil with it which enabled him to see again.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Iron Man'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Daredevil subsequently realized that Stark had added the Extremis virus to San Francisco's water supply, with the phones simply transmitting a subsonic signal that activated the already-existing virus in their bodies, but Stark subjected Matt to minor brain damage to erase his memories of this discovery, intending to reprogram the activation signal to a frequency Daredevil cannot detect.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Iron Man'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was ended when Pepper Potts exposed Tony's true feelings about the world after his inversion.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Iron Man'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the eight months [[timeskip]] after 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]", Tony Stark has returned to his normal self with no signs of his moral inversion personality.&lt;ref&gt;''Invincible Iron Man'' vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt; The Extremis virus remains unknown.

==Reception==
''Extremis'' received favorable reviews,&lt;ref name="Smithson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comicsbulletin review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsbulletin.com/old-site-archive/?review=117326541754358|title=Iron Man: Extremis|date=March 7, 2007|last=Wallace|first=Dave|work=[[Comics Bulletin]]|accessdate=2015-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612041203/http://comicsbulletin.com/old-site-archive/?review=117326541754358|archivedate=June 12, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often listed as one of the best Iron Man stories.&lt;ref name="James Hunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alan Kistler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate Bookshelf 2.0: Iron Man"/&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* The ''Extremis'' mini-series was loosely adapted as an ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode of the same name.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In the episode, the Extremis formula is retconned as an attempt to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum that granted [[Captain America]] his powers. Mallen (here an ex-agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] rather than a terrorist) injects himself with the formula after being fired by [[Nick Fury]], and badly injures Iron Man during their initial encounter. Tony then injects himself with a small amount of a modified version of the Extremis formula, allowing him to fully interface with his armor (along with all other forms of technology) and defeat Mallen. According to [[Andros Stark]] in the episode "Iron Man 2099", in the future everyone has an upgraded version of Extremis, and he himself (in [[Marvel 2099|2099]]) runs version 16.5 named [[Edwin Jarvis|J.A.R.V.I.S.]]
* The Extremis serum appears in the TV series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', continuing the plot thread from ''Iron Man 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/18421-sdcc-13-marvel-s-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-live.html |title=AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D. Pilot Details Revealed [SPOILERS |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=2013-07-19 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot episode introduces Michael Peterson ([[J. August Richards]]), a former factory worker who was injected by Project Centipede with an experimental serum that is the Extremis combined with [[Chitauri]] metal, gamma radiation, and an attempted recreation of super soldier serum. In "The Girl in the Flower Dress", Project Centipede attempts to improve the serum by experimenting on [[pyrokinetic]] street performer Chan Ho Yi, increasing his pyrokinetic abilities. Centipede operative Raina ([[Ruth Negga]]) later reveals that Project Centipede has found a way to keep the unstable elements of Extremis from combusting upon harvesting his blood platelets. After her mission was a success, Raina visits Edison Po in prison to tell the "Clairvoyant" about the status of the mission. In "T.A.H.I.T.I." and "Ragtag", S.H.I.E.L.D. turncoat [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]] is revealed to be the "Clairvoyant" of Project Centipede which itself is revealed to be a branch of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] and that the research Centipede has conducted on the serum has been for the purpose of restoring his failing [[Deathlok]] implants. When Raina injects the serum into Garrett's body after it has been mixed with what remained of the [[Kree]]-based GH-325 serum, Garrett stabilizes while losing his sanity as a consequence of the GH-325's side effects.

===Film===
* The origin and armor of Iron Man used in the [[2008 in film|2008]] film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' closely resemble those introduced in ''Extremis''. Based on his work on ''Extremis'', artist Adi Granov was brought on as a producer for the film,&lt;ref name="Iron Man: This One was Mine"/&gt; and he created the final designs for Iron Man's armor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=128887 Forging Iron: Adi Granov talks Iron Man] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304145337/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=128887 |date=2009-03-04 }}, [[Newsarama]], September 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[DVD]] of ''Iron Man'', the featurette "Extremis and Beyond" is included as a special feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Neil |last=Miller |url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/news/iron-man-looks-like-a-badass-on-his-dvd-cover-too.php |title=Iron Man Looks Like a Badass on his DVD Cover, Too |publisher=Filmschoolrejects.com |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928171548/http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/news/iron-man-looks-like-a-badass-on-his-dvd-cover-too.php |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other featurettes, Adi Granov and Warren Ellis were interviewed on the origin, the suits, John Pillinger (the interviewer), and the suit being on a crate, not a briefcase.
* The storyline serves as the primary source material for the 2013 film ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.&lt;ref name="Screenrant.com"/&gt; Although the exact nature of Extremis is subtly changed, the key powers of enhanced strength and fire generation remain, although the enhanced soldiers are not as enhanced as in the comics, as Stark is able to fight them with remote-controlled armors rather than being required to give himself Extremis to face them on an equal footing.

===Video games===
* Iron Man wears the Extremis suit in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/gt-pop-block-marvel-vs/64777#new_comment |title=GT Pop-Block: Debut Trailer: Marvel Vs Capcom 3: Fate Of Two Worlds Video Game |publisher=GameTrailers.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the follow-up, ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]''.
* The Extremis Suit is an optional suit in the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS|DS]] versions of the [[Iron Man 2 (video game)|''Iron Man 2'']] video game.
* Extremis soldiers are featured in ''[[Iron Man 3: The Official Game]]''.
* Extremis appears in ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''. It appears as part of Special Operations 9 which involves Iron Man, Rescue, and Iron Patriot fighting off Extremis-enhanced super-soldiers invading Avengers Tower while trying to investigate the source of the project.
* Extremis soldiers appear in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marvelsuperheroes.lego.com/en-us/Products/76006.aspx "76006 Iron Man: Extremis Sea Port Battle"]. [[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]. Retrieved September 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; They accompany Mandarin and Aldrich Killian in the attack on Stark Tower.

===Toys===
* Hasbro released a 6-inch Marvel Legends Extremis figure and variant blue stealth version in 2012 and a 3.75 inch version in the Marvel Universe toyline. The MU version has been reissued in a comic pack.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
* A 6-inch action figure of Iron Man featuring the Extremis armor was released in the first wave of the return of [[Marvel Legends]] in 2012 with a blue stealth variant. A re-release of the figure in darker colors was planned for the movie based toy line "Iron Man: Armored Avenger" (which featured comic book characters and armors such as [[Crimson Dynamo]] and [[Titanium Man]], as well) before the line was cancelled.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Motion comic===
In 2010 [[Marvel Knights Animation]] created a motion comic with 3-D cell shading graphics. The six-part mini-series was released by [[Shout! Factory]] first on DVD, and then later coupled with ''[[Spider-Woman: Agent Of S.W.O.R.D.]]'' on Blu-ray.

===Novel===
A novel adaption of ''Iron Man: Extremis'' was released in May 2013 to tie with the release of the ''Iron Man 3'' film as part of the Marvel Prose Novel series, and was written and adapted by comic writer and editor [[Marie Javins]].

==''The Future is Wild''==
''[[The Future is Wild]]'' was a speculative documentary hypothetising how life could evolve over the course of millions of years:

*5,000,000: the world is in an [[ice age]]. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] will be a vast salt plain and the [[Amazon rainforest]] will be a grassland. Creatures of this land include huge killer birds, thin-legged pigs, sticky-frilled lizards and birds that act like whales. Humans, by this time, have either gone extinct or have left the planet.
*100,000,000: in 100,000,000 years' time, the world will be very hot due to excess volcanic activity. Antarctica will be a lush rainforest. Creatures of this world include dinosaur-sized tortoises, amphibious octopuses, four-winged birds and [[eusocial]] spiders. At this time, there is also only one species of mammal left, which is "farmed" by the spiders.
*200,000,000: in 200 million years' time the world will contain one global ocean and one continent, like [[Pangaea]]. Approximately 100 million years before this time, there was a [[mass extinction]] and now most of the world's land is desert, with a couple of rainforests around the edge. Creatures of this world include air-breathing flying fish, giant [[plankton]], various huge worms, highly specialized insects and intelligent, arboreal land-squid. There are no mammals, no birds, no reptiles, no amphibians, only one species of flowering plants and only sharks left to represent aquatic fish. Other creatures have moved in to fill these niches.

==''Last and First Men'' and ''Star Maker''==
[[Olaf Stapledon]]'s novels ''[[Last and First Men]]'' and ''[[Star Maker]]'' are speculations on the evolution of intelligence in the universe. ''Last and First Men'' explores the future evolution of intelligence on Earth, while ''Star Maker'' explores the technological and social changes undergone by various alien species.

==''The Last Question''==
[[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story ''[[The Last Question]]'' charts the future evolution of Man as subsequent generations ask ever-more complex computers the same question: "Can [[entropy]] be reversed?" The story begins in 2061, when the supercomputer [[Multivac]] is asked the question and responds: "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER". The story then jumps forward to an unspecified time at least a thousand years later, in which a spaceship-borne computer is asked the same question, and gives the same answer.

*ca. 22,000: Humans, now immortal, are filling up the Milky Way galaxy and are considering expanding beyond it. The Galactic AC is asked the question and replies: "THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER"
*ca. 10,000,000,000: Mankind now sleeps in hibernation as minds travel the universe. The hyperspatial computer the Universal AC is asked the question and replies, "THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."
*ca. 100,000,000,000: Man, now a single cosmic intelligence, realizes that the stars are winding down. The Cosmic AC is asked the question and responds: "THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."
*ca. 10,000,000,000,000: Man fuses with the AC and entropy destroys the universe. Some unspecified amount of time later, the AC, from its home in hyperspace, formulates its answer to the question and demonstrates it with the exclamation "[[Let there be light]]!"

[[Image:William Hogarth - Gin Lane.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gin Lane]] by [[William Hogarth]], 1751]]
The '''Gin Craze''' was a period in the first half of the 18th century when the consumption of [[gin]] increased rapidly in [[Great Britain]], especially in [[London]]. [[Daniel Defoe]] commented: "the Distillers have found out a way to hit the palate of the Poor, by their new fashion'd compound Waters called Geneva, so that the common People seem not to value the French-brandy as usual, and even not to desire it".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=Iqs_AAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22good%20old%20days%22%20defoe&amp;pg=RA1-PA91#v=onepage&amp;q=compound%20waters&amp;f=false The Complete English Tradesman, Vol 2, Page 91 Daniel Defoe, 1727&lt;/ref&gt; Many people overconsumed and the city had an epidemic of extreme [[drunkenness]]; this provoked [[Moral panic|moral outrage]] and a legislative backlash that some compare to the modern [[Prohibition (drugs)|drug war]]s.

Parliament passed five major Acts, in 1729, 1736, 1743, 1747 and 1751, designed to control the consumption of gin. Though many similar drinks were available and alcohol consumption was considerable at all levels of society, gin caused the greatest public concern. Although it is commonly thought gin or Jenever was the singular drink, "gin" was a blanket statement for all grain-based alcohols at the time.

==Increased consumption of gin==

Gin was popularised in England following the accession of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] in 1688. Gin provided an alternative to French [[brandy]] at a time of both political and religious conflict between Britain and France. Between 1689 and 1697, the Government passed a range of legislation aimed at restricting brandy imports and encouraging gin production. Most importantly, the monopoly of the London Guild of Distillers was broken in 1690, thereby opening up the market in gin distillation.  The production and consumption of English gin, which was then popular amongst politicians and even [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], was encouraged by the government. This encouragement was shown in the reduced taxes on the distillation of spirits. Additionally, no licenses were needed to make spirits, so distillers of spirits could have smaller, more simple workshops than brewers, who needed to serve food and provide shelter for patrons.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Roderick|title=Alcohol A History|date=2014|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economic protectionism was a major factor in beginning the Gin Craze; as the price of food dropped and income grew, consumers suddenly had the opportunity to spend excess funds on spirits. By 1721, however, [[Middlesex]] [[magistrate]]s were already decrying gin as "the principal cause of all the vice &amp; debauchery committed among the inferior sort of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4727944/A-tonic-for-the-nation.html|title=A tonic for the nation|date=2002-06-09|accessdate=2010-08-30|author=Kate Chisholm|newspaper=Telegraph}} In a review of ''The Much-Lamented Death of Madam Geneva'' by Patrick Dillon.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1736, the Middlesex Magistrates complained: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is with the deepest concern your committee observe the strong Inclination of the inferior Sort of People to these destructive Liquors, and how surprisingly this Infection has spread within these few Years … it is scarce possible for Persons in low Life to go anywhere or to be anywhere, without being drawn in to taste, and, by Degrees, to like and approve of this pernicious Liquor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7rYRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA326&amp;lpg=PA326#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Pamphleteer, Volume 29  By Abraham John Valpy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Gin Acts of 1736 and 1751==
{{Main|Gin Act 1751}}
The British government tried a number of times to stop the flow of gin.  The [[Gin Act 1736]] taxed retail sales at a rate of 20 shillings a gallon on spirits and required licensees to take out a £50 annual licence to sell gin, a fee equivalent to about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1736|r=-3}}}} today.  The aim was to effectively prohibit the trade by making it economically unfeasible.  Only two licences were ever taken out.  The trade became illegal, consumption dipped but then continued to rise and the law was effectively repealed in 1743 following mass law-breaking and violence (particularly towards informers who were paid £5 to reveal the whereabouts of illegal gin shops).  The illegally distilled gin which was produced following the 1736 Act was less reliable and more likely to result in poisoning.

By 1743, England was drinking 2.2 [[Imperial (UK) gallon#Measures of volume|gallons]] (10 litres) of gin per person per year.  As consumption levels increased, an organised campaign for more effective legislation began to emerge, led by the [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]], Thomas Wilson, who, in 1736, had complained that gin produced a "drunken ungovernable set of people".  Prominent anti-gin campaigners included [[Henry Fielding]] (whose 1751 "Enquiry into the Late Increase in Robbers" blamed gin consumption for both increased crime and increased ill health among children), [[Josiah Tucker]], [[Daniel Defoe]] (who had originally campaigned for the liberalisation of distilling, but later complained that drunken mothers were threatening to produce a "fine spindle-shanked generation" of children), and – briefly – [[William Hogarth]]. Hogarth's engraving ''[[Gin Lane]]'' is a well known image of the gin craze, and is often paired with "[[Beer Street]]", creating a contrast between the miserable lives of gin drinkers and the healthy and enjoyable lives of beer drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=2008|publisher=Gotham|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gin Craze began to diminish after the [[Gin Act 1751]].  This Act lowered the annual licence fees, but encouraged "respectable" gin selling by requiring licensees to trade from premises rented for at least £10 a year.  Historians suggest that gin consumption was reduced not as a result of legislation but because of the rising cost of grain.  Landowners could afford to abandon the production of gin, and this fact, coupled with population growth and a series of poor harvests, resulted in lower wages and increased food prices.  The Gin Craze had mostly ended by 1757.  The government tried to ensure this by temporarily banning the manufacture of spirits from domestic grain. There was a resurgence of gin consumption during the [[Victorian era]], with numerous "[[Gin palace|Gin Palaces]]" appearing. In 1840, the amount of gin consumed in London (but by that time with a population in excess of one million) finally matched that from when prohibition ended in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillon|first1=Patrick|title=Gin: The Much-Lamented Death of Madam Geneva: The Eighteenth-Century Gin Craze|date=2002|publisher=Review|location=London|isbn=1-932112-25-1|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustav Bauernfeind''' (4 September 1848, [[Sulz am Neckar]] - 24 December 1904, [[Jerusalem]]) was a German [[Painting|painter]], [[illustrator]] and architect of partly Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Son père, pharmacien juif autrichien installé en Bade-Wurtemberg, s'était converti au catholicisme. Cf. Adrian Darmon, Autour de l'Art Juif, Ed. Carnot, 2003, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to be one of the most notable [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painters of Germany.

==Life and career==
After completing his architectural studies at the [[University of Stuttgart|Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Stuttgart]], he worked in the architectural firm of Professor Wilhelm Bäumer and later in that of Adolph Gnauth, where he also learned painting. In his earlier paintings, Bauernfeind focused on local views of Germany, as well as motifs from Italy. During his journey to the [[Levant]] from 1880 to 1882, he became interested in the [[Orient]] and repeated his travels again and again. In 1896 he moved with his wife and son all the way to Palestine and subsequently settled in Jerusalem in 1898. He also lived and worked in Lebanon and Syria.

His work is characterized primarily by architectural views of Jerusalem and the [[Holy Land]]. The paintings of Bauernfeind are mostly meticulously crafted, intricately composed and almost photographically accurate cityscapes and images of known sanctuaries in oil. In addition, he produced [[landscape art|landscape scenes]] and [[watercolor painting|watercolours]]. During his lifetime he was the most popular Orientalist painter of Germany, but soon fell into oblivion after his death. However, since the early 1980s, Bauernfeind was gradually rediscovered, with his paintings appearing at auctions with high prices. Thus, his oil painting ''The Wailing Wall'' was sold at [[Christie's]] in London for the equivalent of €326,000 in 1992. The same painting would reach at [[Sotheby's]] in London the equivalent of €4.5 million in a later auction in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Sefanie Stadel: ''Aufstieg eines Orientmalers.'' In: ''[[Welt am Sonntag]],'' Nr. 27/2007, S. 74&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, another oil painting of Bauernfeind, ''The Port of Jaffa'', was sold at the Van Ham Kunstauktionen in [[Cologne]] for 1,510,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]], thus becoming the most expensive 19th-century painting ever sold in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.van-ham.com/rekordgalerie/gdr/detail/neuere-meister/gustav-bauernfeind.html|title=Van Ham, Galerie der Rekorde|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At his birthplace in Sulz am Neckar, the life and work of the painter is commemorated by the Gustav Bauernfeind Museum with a large permanent exhibition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2334">A '''hyphenated ethnicity''' or '''hyphenated identity''' is a reference to an [[ethnicity]] combined with the name of the country of residence.&lt;ref name=visco&gt;Visconti, L., Jafari, A., Batat, W., Broeckerhoff, A., Dedeoglu, A., Demangeot, C., ...

([https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/files/36830777/Visconti_etal_JMM_consumer_ethnicity_three_decades_after.pdf online])&lt;/ref&gt; The term is an extension of the term "[[hyphenated American]]".  The term refers to the use of a [[hyphen]] between the name of an ethnicity and the name of the country in [[compound noun]]s: [[Irish-American]], etc., although modern English language style guides recommend dropping the hyphen: "Irish American".

The concept should not be confused with that of [[mixed ethnicity]] and [[multiracial]]ity, i.e., the ethnicity or race of a person who parents have different ethnicities/races, which can also be written in a hyphenated way.

==United States==
{{main|Hyphenated American}}
The term "hyphenated American" originated in 1890s and was used disparagingly as a reference to immigrants who, by brandishing their ethnic origin, allegedly demonstrated an incomplete allegiance to the United States, especially during the [[World War I]] period.&lt;ref&gt;John Higham, ''Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860–1925'' (1955) [https://books.google.com/books?id=UzVhOx7WuMMC&amp;pg=PA198  p. 198]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeffrey Lesser]] wrote: "While there is no linguistic categories that acknowledge hyphenated ethnicity (a third generation Brzilian or Japanese descendent remains 'Japanese' while a fourth-generation Brazilian of Lebanese descent may become a ''turco'', an ''arabe'', a ''sirio'', or a ''sirio-libanese''), in fact immigrant communities aggressively tried to negotiate a status that allowed for both Brazilian nationality and ethnic difference". &lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Lesser]], "(Re) Creating Ethnicity: Middle Eastern Immigration to Brazil", The Americas Vol. 53, No. 1 (Jul., 1996), pp. 45-65 {{JSTOR|1007473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33955">Unlike many languages, [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] has only very minor [[dialect]]al differences in sounds. The language has both [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s, and many consonants can be [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] or [[unvoiced]].

Icelandic has an [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] [[minimal pair|contrast]] between [[plosive]]s, rather than a voicing contrast, similar to [[Standard Chinese]]. Preaspirated voiceless stops are also common. However, [[fricative consonant|fricative]] and [[sonorant consonant]] [[phoneme]]s exhibit regular contrasts in voice, including in [[nasal stop|nasals]] (rare in the world's languages). Additionally, length is contrastive for consonants, but not vowels. In Icelandic, the main stress is always on the first syllable.

==Consonants==
{{IPA notice}}
The number and nature of the consonant [[phoneme]]s in modern Icelandic is subject to broad disagreement, due to a complex relationship among consonant [[allophone]]s.

===Major allophones===

Even the number of major allophones is subject to some dispute, although less than for phonemes.  The following is a chart of potentially contrastive ''[[phone (phonetics)|phone]]s'' (important phonetic distinctions which minimally contrast in some positions with known phonemes; ''not'' a chart of actual phonemes), according to one analysis {{harv|Thráinsson|1994}}:

* {{IPA|/n̥, n, l̥, l/}} are alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n̥}}, {{IPA link|n}}, {{IPA link|l̥}}, {{IPA link|l}}]}}, whereas {{IPA|/tʰ, t/}} are dental {{IPA|[t̪ʰ, {{IPA link|t̪}}]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Árnason|2011|pp=99, 110, 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/s/}} is an apical alveolar sibilant fricative,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kress|1982|pp=23–24}} "It is never voiced, as ''s'' in ''sausen'', and it is pronounced by pressing the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge, close to the upper teeth – somewhat below the place of articulation of the German ''sch''. The difference is that German ''sch'' is labialized, while Icelandic ''s'' is not. It is a pre-alveolar, coronal, voiceless spirant."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pétursson"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pétursson|1971|p=?}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas {{IPA|/θ, ð/}} are alveolar non-sibilant fricatives {{IPA|[{{IPA link|θ̠}}, {{IPA link|ð̠}}]}}. The former is [[laminal consonant|laminal]], while the latter is usually [[apical consonant|apical]].&lt;ref name="Pétursson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Grønnum|2005|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the alveolar non-sibilant fricatives are not contrastive in any language and so have no dedicated IPA symbols. They are broadly transcribed with {{IPA|/θ, ð/}}, which nominally denote dental fricatives.
* Voiceless continuants {{IPA|/f, s, θ, ç, x, h/}} are always constrictive {{IPA|[{{IPAlink|f}}, {{IPAlink|s̺}}, {{IPAlink|θ̠}}, {{IPAlink|ç}}, {{IPAlink|x}}, {{IPAlink|h}}]}}, but voiced continuants {{IPA|/v, ð, j, ɣ/}} are not very constrictive and are often closer to approximants {{IPA|[{{IPAlink|ʋ}}, {{IPAlink|ɹ|ð̠˕}}, {{IPAlink|j}}, {{IPAlink|ɰ}}]}} than fricatives {{IPA|[{{IPAlink|v}}, {{IPAlink|ð̠}}, {{IPAlink|ʝ}}, {{IPAlink|ɣ}}]}}.
* The rhotic consonants may either be [[Trill consonant|trills]] {{IPA|[{{IPAlink|r̥}}, {{IPAlink|r}}]}} or [[Tap consonant|taps]] {{IPA|[{{IPAlink|ɾ̥}}, {{IPAlink|ɾ}}]}}, depending on the speaker.
* Acoustic analysis reveals that the voiceless lateral approximant {{IPAblink|l̥}} is, in practice, usually realized with considerable frication, especially word-finally or syllable-finally, i.&amp;nbsp;e., essentially as a [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPAblink|ɬ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liberman|first=Mark|title=A little Icelandic phonetics|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2264|work=Language Log|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvcoltxt|Scholten|2000}} includes three extra phones, namely the glottal stop {{IPAblink|ʔ}}, voiceless velarized alveolar lateral approximant {{IPA|[l̥ˠ]}} and its voiced counterpart {{IPAblink|ɫ|lˠ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Scholten|2000|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of competing analyses have been proposed for Icelandic phonemes.  The problems stem from complex but regular alternations and mergers among the above phones in various positions.

===Alternations===
Examples of alternations across different positions:

*{{IPA|[pʰ], [f]}}: ''tæp'' {{IPA|[ˈtʰaɪːpʰ]}} ('uncertain' {{abbr|fem|feminine}}), ''tæpt'' {{IPA|[ˈtʰaɪft]}} ('uncertain' {{abbr|neut|neuter}})
*{{IPA|[p], [f], [v]}}: ''grafa'' {{IPA|[ˈkraːva]}} ('to dig'); ''grafta'' {{IPA|[ˈkrafta]}} ('to dig'); ''grafna'' {{IPA|[ˈkrapna]}} ('to dig')
*{{IPA|[k], [x], [ɣ], [j]}}: ''segi'' {{IPA|[ˈsɛːjɪ]}} ('[I] say'), ''sagt'' {{IPA|[ˈsaxt]}} ('[was] said'), ''sagði'' {{IPA|[ˈsaɣðɪ]}} ('[I] said'), ''sagna'' {{IPA|[ˈsakna]}} ('of stories')

===Restrictions===

====Dorsal consonants (velar, palatal, glottal)====

The "glottal fricative" {{IPAblink|h}} (actually a placeless approximant) only occurs initially before a vowel, and following a vowel in the sequences {{IPA|[hp ht hk hc]}}.  These latter sequences are sometimes said to be unitary "[[preaspiration|pre-aspirated]]" stops; see below.

The voiceless velar fricative {{IPAblink|x}} occurs only between a vowel and {{IPAblink|s}} or {{IPAblink|t}}, and initially as a variant of {{IPA|[kʰ]}} before {{IPA|[v]}}.  Because it does not contrast with {{IPA|[kʰ]}} in either position, it can be seen as an allophone of {{IPA|/kʰ/}}.

There are two sets of palatal sounds. "Alternating palatals" {{IPA|[{{IPA link|c}} cʰ {{IPA link|j}}]}} alternate with the velars {{IPA|[{{IPA link|k}} kʰ {{IPA link|x}} {{IPA link|ɣ}}]}}, while "non-alternating palatals" {{IPA|[ç j]}} do not.  Note that {{IPA|[j]}} appears twice here; these two {{IPA|[j]}}'s behave differently, occur in different distributions, and are denoted by different letters (''g'' and ''j'').  This suggests that they may belong to different phonemes, and that is indeed a common analysis.

In general, the alternating palatals {{IPA|[c cʰ j]}} are restricted to appearing before vowels.  Velars ({{IPA|[k kʰ x ɣ]}} are restricted to appearing everywhere except before front vowels.  In other words: Before back vowels and front rounded vowels, both palatals and velars can appear; before front unrounded vowels only palatals can appear; before consonants only velars can appear.

For the non-alternating palatals {{IPA|[ç j]}}: Both can appear at the beginning of a word, followed by a vowel.  Elsewhere, only one can occur, which must occur after a non-velar, non-palatal consonant.  {{IPA|[j]}} occurs before a vowel, and {{IPA|[ç]}} occurs in a few words at the end of a word following {{IPA|[p t k s]}}.

The velars and alternating palatals are distributed as follows:
*Initially or at beginning of syllable: Only the four stops {{IPA|[kʰ k cʰ c]}} can appear.
*After {{IPA|[s]}} that begins a syllable: only {{IPA|[k c]}}.
*Between vowels: only {{IPA|[k ɣ c j]}}.
*After a vowel, finally or before {{IPA|[v]}} or {{IPA|[r]}}: only {{IPA|[kʰ ɣ]}}.
*After a vowel, before {{IPA|[ð]}}: only {{IPA|[ɣ]}}.
*After a vowel, before {{IPA|[l]}}: only {{IPA|[k]}}.
*After a vowel, before nasals: only {{IPA|[kʰ k]}}.
*After a vowel, before {{IPA|[s t]}}: only {{IPA|[x]}}.

Although the facts are complex, it can be noticed that {{IPAblink|ɣ}} only ever contrasts with one of the two velar stops, never with both, and hence can be taken as an allophone of whichever one doesn't appear in a given context.  Alternatively, following the orthography, {{IPA|[ɣ]}} can be taken as an allophone of {{IPAslink|ɡ}}, where {{IPAblink|k}} is taken as an allophone of either {{IPAslink|k}} or {{IPAslink|ɡ}} depending on context, following the orthography.

====Alveolar non-sibilant fricatives====
In native vocabulary, the fricatives {{IPAblink|θ}} and {{IPAblink|ð}} are allophones of a single phoneme {{IPAslink|θ}}. {{IPA|[θ]}} is used morpheme-initially, as in ''þak'' {{IPA|[ˈθaːk]}} ('roof'), and before a [[voiceless consonant]], as in ''maðkur'' {{IPA|[ˈmaθkʏr̥]}} ('worm'). {{IPA|[ð]}} is used intervocalically, as in ''iða'' {{IPA|[ˈɪːða]}} ('vortex') and word-finally, as in ''bað'' {{IPA|[ˈpaːð]}} ('bath'), although it can be devoiced to {{IPA|[θ]}} before pause. Some [[loanword]]s (mostly from [[Classical Greek]]) have introduced the phone {{IPA|[θ]}} in intervocalic environments, as in ''Aþena'' {{IPA|[ˈaθɛna]}} ('[[Athens]]').{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The phone {{IPA|[θ]}} is actually a [[laminal consonant|laminal]] [[Voiceless alveolar fricative#The voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative|voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative]] {{IPAblink|θ̠}}. The corresponding voiced phone {{IPAblink|ð̠}} is similar, but is [[apical consonant|apical]] rather than laminal {{harv|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}.

====Voiceless sonorants====
Of the voiceless sonorants {{IPA|[{{IPA link|l̥}} {{IPA link|r̥}} {{IPA link|n̥}} {{IPA link|m̥}} {{IPA link|ɲ̊}} {{IPA link|ŋ̊}}]}}, only {{IPA|[l̥ r̥ n̥]}} occur in word-initial position, for example in ''hné'' {{IPA|[ˈn̥jɛː]}} ('knee').  Only in initial position do the voiceless sonorants contrast with the corresponding voiced sonorants. Finally, before aspirated consonants and after voiceless consonants only the voiceless sonorants appear; elsewhere, only the voiced sonorants appear.  This makes it clear that {{IPA|[m̥ ɲ̊ ŋ̊]}} are non-phonemic. Recently, there has been an increasing tendency, especially among children, to pronounce initial ''hn'' as voiced, e.g. ''hnífur'' {{IPA|[ˈnivʏr̥]}} ('knife') rather than standard {{IPA|[ˈn̥ivʏr̥]}}.

====Palatal and velar nasals====
The [[palatal nasal]]s {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɲ̊}} {{IPA link|ɲ}}]}} appear before palatal stops and the [[velar nasal]]s {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ŋ̊}} {{IPA link|ŋ}}]}} before [[velar stop]]s; in these positions, the [[alveolar nasal]]s {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n̥}} {{IPA link|n}}]}} do not occur. {{IPA|[ŋ]}} appears also before {{IPA|[l]}} and {{IPA|[s]}} through the deletion of {{IPA|[k]}} in the [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|[ŋkl]}} and {{IPA|[ŋks]}}.  The palatal nasals are clearly non-phonemic, although there is some debate about {{IPAblink|ŋ}} due to the common deletion of {{IPA|[k]}}.

===Aspiration and length contrasts (medial and final)===

Modern Icelandic is often said to have a rare kind of stops, the so-called ''[[preaspiration|pre-aspirated]] stops'' {{IPA|[ʰp ʰt ʰc ʰk]}} (e.g. ''löpp'' {{IPA|[ˈlœʰp]}} 'foot'), which occur only after a vowel and do not contrast with sequences {{IPA|[hp ht hc hk]}} (which do not occur in Icelandic).  {{harvtxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}} note that phonetically, in Icelandic pre-aspirated stops the aspiration is longer than in normal post-aspirated stops, and is indistinguishable from sequences {{IPA|[hp ht hc hk]}} (or with {{IPAblink|x}} replacing {{IPAblink|h}}) occurring in other languages; hence, they prefer to analyze the pre-aspirated stops as sequences. For example, Icelandic ''nótt'', ''dóttir'' correspond to German ''Nacht'', ''Tochter''.

Following vowels there is a complex alternation among consonant length, vowel length and aspiration.  The following table shows the alternations in medial and final position {{harv|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}:

|}

In most analyses, consonant length is seen as phonemic while vowel length is seen as determined entirely by environment, with long vowels occurring in stressed syllables before single consonants and before certain sequences formed of a consonant plus {{IPA|[v r j]}}, and short vowels occurring elsewhere.  Note that diphthongs also occur long and short.

===Phonemes===
{{see also|Icelandic orthography}}
As discussed above, the phones {{IPA|[{{IPA link|m̥}} {{IPA link|ɲ̊}} {{IPA link|ŋ̊}} {{IPA link|ɲ}} {{IPA link|x}} {{IPA link|ð}}]}}, probably {{IPAblink|ɣ}}, and debatably {{IPAblink|ŋ}} are non-phonemic.  Beyond this, there is a great deal of debate both about the number and identity of the phonemes in Icelandic and the mapping between phonemes and allophones.

There are a number of different approaches:

Phonetic vs. orthographic:

#The "phonetic" approach.  This approach tries to stay as close as possible to the phonetics.  This would assume, for example, that {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[kʰ]}} should be consistently analyzed in all contexts as phonemic {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/kʰ/}}, respectively (or perhaps as an [[archiphoneme]] {{IPA|/K/}} in positions where the two do not contrast), and that {{IPA|[hk]}} is a phonemic sequence {{IPA|/hk/}} (or possibly a unitary [[preaspiration|pre-aspirated]] {{IPA|/ʰk/}}).
#The "orthographic" approach (e.g. {{harvnb|Thráinsson|1978}}).  This approach takes the [[orthography]] (i.e. the spelling) as approximately indicative of the underlying phonemes.  This approach generally assumes, for example, phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} which occur in accordance with the orthography (i.e. {{IPA|/k/}} where written ''k'', {{IPA|/ɡ/}} where written ''g''), where {{IPA|/k/}} has allophones {{IPA|[kʰ]}}, {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[x]}} depending on the context, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} has allophones {{IPA|[k]}}, {{IPA|[ɣ]}} and {{IPA|[x]}}.  {{IPA|[hk]}} is analyzed as {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/kk/}}, while {{IPA|[kk]}} is analyzed as {{IPA|/ɡɡ/}}, again consistent with the orthography.  A variant would assume that {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} merge into an [[archiphoneme]] {{IPA|/K/}} in contexts where the two cannot be distinguished, e.g. before {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/t/}}, where both would be pronounced as {{IPA|[x]}}.  Note that in this approach, a particular phone will often be an allophone of different phonemes depending on context; e.g. {{IPA|[k]}} would be taken as {{IPA|/ɡ/}} initially, but {{IPA|/k/}} between vowels.

Maximalist vs. minimalist:

#The "maximalist" approach.  This approach generally takes the contrasting phones as unit phonemes unless there is a good reason not to.  This would assume, for example, that the palatal stops {{IPA|[c cʰ]}}, voiceless sonorants {{IPA|[l̥ r̥ n̥]}} and perhaps the velar nasal {{IPA|[ŋ]}} are separate phonemes, at least in positions where they cannot be analyzed as allophones of other unitary phonemes (e.g. initially for the voiceless sonorants, before {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} for the velar nasal).
#The "minimalist" approach.  This approach analyzes phones as clusters whenever possible, in order to reduce the number of phonemes and (in some cases) better account for alternations.  This would assume, for example, that the palatal stops, voiceless sonorants and velar nasal {{IPA|[ŋ]}} are phonemic clusters, in accordance with the orthography.  In [[structuralism (linguistics)|structuralist]] analyses, which passed out of vogue starting in the 1960s as [[generative grammar|generative]] approaches took off, even more extreme minimalist approaches were common.  An example is {{harv|Haugen|1958}}. Although he presents more than one analysis, the most minimal analysis not only accepts all the clusters indicated in the orthography, but also analyzes the aspirates as sequences {{IPA|/bh/}}, {{IPA|/ɡh/}}, {{IPA|/dh/}} (or {{IPA|/ph/}}, {{IPA|/kh/}}, {{IPA|/th/}} depending on how the non-aspirate stops are analyzed) and reduces all vowels and diphthongs down to a set of 6 vowels.

The main advantage of the phonetic approach is its simplicity compared with the orthographic approach.  A major disadvantage, however, is that it results in a large number of unexplained lexical and grammatical alternations.  Under the orthographic approach, for example (especially if a minimalist approach is also adopted), all words with the root ''sag-/seg-'' ('say') have a phonemic {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, despite the varying phones {{IPA|[k], [x], [ɣ], [j]}} occurring in different lexical and inflectional forms, and similarly all words with the root ''sak-'' ('blame') have a phonemic {{IPA|/k/}}, despite the varying phones {{IPA|[k], [kʰ], [hk]}}.  Under the phonetic approach, however, the phonemes would vary depending on the context is complicated and seemingly arbitrary ways.  Similarly, an orthographic analysis of three words for "white", ''hvítur'' ''hvít'' ''hvítt'' {{IPA|[ˈkʰviːtʏr] [ˈkʰviːtʰ] [ˈkʰviht]}} ({{abbr|masc|masculine}} sg, {{abbr|fem|feminine}} sg, {{abbr|neut|neuter}} {{abbr|sg|singular}}) as {{IPA|/kvitʏr/ /kvit/ /kvitt/}} allows for a simple analysis of the forms as a root {{IPA|/kvit-/}} plus endings {{IPA|/-ʏr/, /-/, /-t/}} and successfully explains the surface alternation {{IPA|[iːt] [iːtʰ] [iht]}}, which would not be possible in a strictly phonetic approach.

Assuming a basically orthographic approach, the set of phonemes in Icelandic is as follows:

A maximalist analysis sees them as separate phonemes (e.g. {{IPAslink|ɟ}} and {{IPAslink|c}}, respectively), while in a minimalist analysis they are [[allophone]]s of {{IPAslink|k}} and {{IPAslink|ɡ}} before front unrounded vowels, and of the sequences {{IPA|/kj/}} and {{IPA|/ɡj/}} before rounded vowels, in accordance with the orthography.  The maximalist approach accords with the presence of [[minimal pair]]s like ''gjóla'' {{IPA|[ˈcouːla]}} ('light wind') vs. ''góla'' {{IPA|[ˈkouːla]}} ('howl') and ''kjóla'' {{IPA|[ˈcʰouːla]}} ('dresses') vs. ''kóla'' {{IPA|[ˈkʰouːla]}} ('cola'), along with general speakers' intuitions.  However, the minimalist approach (e.g. {{harvnb|Rögnvaldsson|1993}}) accounts for some otherwise unexplained gaps in the system (e.g. the absence of palatal/velar contrasts except before rounded vowels, and the absence of phonetic {{IPA|[j]}} after velars and palatals), as well as otherwise unexplained alternations between palatals and velars in e.g. ''segi'' {{IPA|[ˈsɛiːjɪ]}} ('[I] say') vs. ''sagði'' {{IPA|[ˈsaɣðɪ]}} ('[I] said'; assuming that {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ]}} are taken as allophones of palatal and velar stops, respectively). On the other hand, the number of such alternations is not as great as for stop vs. fricative alternations; most lexical items consistently have either velars or palatals.

The voiceless sonorants are straightforwardly taken as allophones of voiced sonorants in most positions, because of lack of any contrast; similarly for {{IPAslink|ç}} vs. {{IPAslink|j}}.  On the other hand, {{IPA|[l̥ r̥ n̥ ç]}} do contrast with {{IPA|[l r n j]}} in initial position, suggesting that they may be phonemes in this position, consistent with a maximalist analysis.  A minimalist analysis, however, would note the restricted distribution of these phonemes, the lack of contrast in this position with sequences {{IPA|[hl hr hn hj]}} and the fact that similar sequences {{IPA|[kl kr kn]}} do occur, and analyze {{IPA|[l̥ r̥ n̥ ç]}} as {{IPA|/hl hr hn hj/}}, in accordance with the orthography.

The velar nasal {{IPAslink|ŋ}} is clearly an allophone of {{IPAblink|n}} before a velar stop.  When it occurs before {{IPAblink|l}} or {{IPAblink|s}} as a result of deletion of an intervening {{IPAslink|k}}, however, some scholars analyze it as a phoneme {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, while others analyze it as a sequence, e.g. {{IPA|/nɡ/}}.

==Vowels==
[[File:Icelandic vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|Vowels of Icelandic, from {{Harvcoltxt|Volhardt|2011|p=7}}]]
There is less disagreement over the vowel phonemes in Icelandic than the consonant phonemes. The [[Old Icelandic]] vowel system involving phonemic length was transformed to the modern system where phonetic length is automatically determined by the syllable structure.  In the process of eliminating vowel length, however, relatively few vowel distinctions have been lost, as the loss of phonemic length has been offset by an increase in the number of quality distinctions and diphthongs.

=== Vowel length ===
[[Vowel length]] is mostly predictable in Icelandic {{harv|Orešnik|Pétursson|1977}}. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stressed]] vowels (both monophthongs and diphthongs) are long:
*In one-syllable words where the vowel is word-final:
**''fá'' {{IPA|[ˈfauː]}} ('get')
**''nei'' {{IPA|[ˈneiː]}} ('no')
**''þú'' {{IPA|[ˈθuː]}} ('you' singular)
*Before a single consonant:
**''fara'' {{IPA|[ˈfaːra]}} ('go')
**''hás'' {{IPA|[ˈhauːs]}} ('hoarse')
**''vekja'' {{IPA|[ˈvɛːca]}} ('wake [someone] up')
**''ég'' {{IPA|[ˈjɛːɣ]}} ('I')
**''spyr'' {{IPA|[ˈspɪːr]}} ('I ask')
*Before any of the [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|[pr tr kr sr]}}, {{IPA|[pj tj kj sj]}}, or {{IPA|[tv kv]}}. (This is often shortened to the rule: If the first of the consonants is one of ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', ''s'' and the second is one of ''j'', ''v'', ''r'', then the vowel is long. This is known as the ''ptks+jvr-rule''. An exception occurs, if there is a ''t'' before the [[infix]] ''k''. Examples are e. g. ''notkun'' and ''litka''. There are also additional exceptions like '''um''' and ''fram'' where the vowel is short in spite of rules and ''en'', where the vowel length depends on the context.)
**''lipra'' {{IPA|[ˈlɪːpra]}} ('agile' accusative feminine)
**''sætra'' {{IPA|[ˈsaiːtra]}} ('sweet' genitive plural)
**''akra'' {{IPA|[ˈaːkra]}} ('fields' accusative plural)
**''hásra'' {{IPA|[ˈhauːsra]}} ('hoarse' genitive plural)
**''vepja'' {{IPA|[ˈvɛːpja]}} ('lapwing')
**''letja'' {{IPA|[ˈlɛːtja]}} ('dissuade')
**''Esja'' {{IPA|[ˈɛːsja]}} ('[[Esja]]')
**''vekja'' {{IPA|[ˈvɛːca]}} ('awaken')
**''götva'' {{IPA|[ˈkœːtva]}} as in ''uppgötva'' ('discover')
**''vökva'' {{IPA|[ˈvœːkva]}} ('water' verb)
*''g'' shows a peculiar behavior. If we have the combination V+''gi'', then the vowel V is short and the ''gi'' is then pronounced {{IPA|[jɪ]}}. In the combinations V+''g''+V (the second vowel not being ''i'') the first vowel is long and ''g'' is pronounced {{IPA|ɣ}}. An example: ''logi'' {{IPA|[ˈlɔjɪ]}} (''flame'', nominative singular) vs. logar {{IPA|[ˈlɔːɣar]}} (''flames'', nominative plural)&lt;ref&gt;As a written letter, ''g'' is the most eccentric of all. For instance ''guð'' (''God'') is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈkvʏːθ]}} (nominative and accusative singular) but {{IPA|[ˈkvʏːði]}} (dative singular), {{IPA|[ˈkvʏðs]}} (genitive singular) and the {{IPA|[ð]}} is always used between vowels.&lt;/ref&gt;
Before other consonant clusters (including the preaspirated stops {{IPA|[hp ht hk]}} and [[Gemination|geminate]] consonants), stressed vowels are short. Unstressed vowels are always short.
*''Karl'' {{IPA|[ˈkʰartl̥]}} ('[[Carl (name)|Carl]]')
*''standa'' {{IPA|[ˈstanta]}} ('stand')
*''sjálfur'' {{IPA|[ˈsjaulvʏr]}} ('self')
*''kenna'' {{IPA|[ˈcʰɛnːa]}} ('teach')
*''fínt'' {{IPA|[ˈfin̥t]}} ('fine')
*''loft'' {{IPA|[ˈlɔft]}} ('air')
*''upp'' {{IPA|[ˈʏhp]}} ('up')
*''yrði'' {{IPA|[ˈɪrðɪ]}} as in ''nýyrði'' ('neologism')
*''ætla'' {{IPA|[ˈaihtla]}} ('will' verb)
*''laust'' {{IPA|[ˈløist]}} ('loose')

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Influence of ''Sesame Street''}}
The children's television program ''[[Sesame Street]]'' premiered in 1969 to high ratings, positive reviews, and some controversy, which have continued during its history. Even though the show aired on only 67% of American televisions at the time of its premiere, it earned a 3.3 Nielsen rating, or 1.9 million households. By its tenth anniversary in 1979, 9 million American children under the age of six were watching ''Sesame Street'' daily. Its ratings declined in the 1990s, due to societal changes. A survey conducted in 1996 found that by the age of three, 95% of all American children had watched it. By its fortieth anniversary in 2009, it was ranked the fifteenth most popular children's show.

According to writer Michael Davis, ''Sesame Street'' is "perhaps the most vigorously researched, vetted, and fretted-over program".&lt;ref name="davis-357"/&gt; By 2001, there were over 1,000 research studies regarding its efficacy, impact, and effect on American culture. Two landmark summative evaluations, conducted by the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that ''Sesame Street'' had a significant educational impact on its viewers. Additional studies conducted throughout the show's history demonstrated that the show continued to have a positive effect on its young viewers.

''Sesame Street'' has also been the subjects of many controversies throughout its long run on television. In 1970, a commission in Mississippi voted to exclude the show from its state educational TV programming. The controversy surrounding the show stemmed from cultural and historical reasons regarding children and television's effect on them.&lt;ref name="morrow-3"/&gt; Latino and feminists groups criticized ''Sesame Street'' for its depictions of some groups, but its producers have worked to address their concerns throughout the years. By 2009, ''Sesame Street'' had received 118 [[Emmy Awards]], more than any other television series.

==Ratings==
When ''Sesame Street'' premiered in 1969, it aired on only 67.6% of American televisions, but it earned a 3.3 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] rating, or 1.9 million households.&lt;ref name="Seligsohn"/&gt; The [[Children's Television Workshop]] (CTW), the organization that oversaw the production of ''Sesame Street'', insisted that its seemingly low ratings were misleading. They found that although a small percentage of all viewers watched ''Sesame Street'', approximately a quarter of all preschoolers watched it regularly.  Ninety percent of households who viewed the show had children under the age of six.&lt;ref name="morrow-117"/&gt;

In the winter of 1970, partly as a response to criticism that they were not reaching their intended audience, the CTW conducted a poll of four urban neighborhoods in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The results of the poll were positive in three out of the four neighborhoods and confirmed the show's high viewership.&lt;ref name="poll"/&gt; ''Sesame Street's'' high ratings increased during its second season, and Nielsen reported high audience loyalty.&lt;ref name="lesser-205"/&gt; [[Gerald S. Lesser]], CTW's first advisory board chair, reported rumors about the show becoming a fad among college students.&lt;ref name="lesser-170"/&gt; Its ratings steadily increased for the first five seasons, and Nielsen reported that ''Sesame Street'' had the highest ratings of any PBS program.&lt;ref name="morrow-118"/&gt; In 1985, the Workshop estimated that 20% of its regular viewers consisted of adults.&lt;ref name="rothenberg"/&gt;

By the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, 9 million American children under the age of six were watching ''Sesame Street'' daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show.&lt;ref name="Davis, p. 277"/&gt; According to a 1993 survey conducted by the [[US Department of Education]], out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.&lt;ref name="zill"/&gt;

The show's ratings significantly decreased in the early 1990s, when children' viewing habits and the television marketplace had changed. In 1969, the choices in children's programming were limited, but the growth of the home-video industry during the 1980s and the boom in children's programming during the 90s on cable channels like [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], which were directly influenced by ''Sesame Street'', resulted in lower ratings for ''Sesame Street''. In 2002, ''The New York Times'' reported that "learning to click the remote control has become a developmental milestone, like crawling and walking".&lt;ref name="salamon"/&gt; The producers responded to these societal changes by making large-scale structural changes to the show.&lt;ref name="weiss"/&gt;

By 2006, ''Sesame Street'' had become "the most widely viewed children's television show in the world", with 20 [[International co-productions of Sesame Street|international independent versions]] and broadcasts in over 120 countries.&lt;ref name="friedman-educates"/&gt; A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old.&lt;ref name="growing"/&gt; In 2006, it was estimated that 75 million Americans had watched the series as children.&lt;ref name="friedman-educates"/&gt; By the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was ranked the fifteenth most popular children's show on television.&lt;ref name="counts"/&gt;

==Effect==
{{Main|Sesame_Street_research#Summative research}}
According to Davis, ''Sesame Street'' is "perhaps the most vigorously researched, vetted, and fretted-over program".&lt;ref name="davis-357"/&gt;  By 2001, there were over 1,000 research studies regarding its efficacy, impact, and effect on American culture.&lt;ref name="cooney-xii"/&gt; The CTW solicited the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) to conduct its summative research.&lt;ref name="miekle-85"/&gt;  ETS' two "landmark"&lt;ref name="mielke-88"/&gt; summative evaluations, conducted in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that ''Sesame Street'' had a significant educational impact on its viewers.&lt;ref name="palmer"/&gt;  These studies provided the majority of the early educational effects of ''Sesame Street'' and have been cited in other studies of the effects of television on young children.&lt;ref name="mielke-88"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to Palmer and his colleague Shalom M. Fisch, these studies were responsible for securing funding for the show over the next several years (Palmer &amp; Fisch, p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies conducted throughout ''Sesame Street's'' history demonstrated that the show continued to have a positive effect on its young viewers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For a discussion of these studies, see Gikow, pp. 284-285; ''"G" is For Growing: Thirty Years of Research on Children and Sesame Street'', pp. 147-230&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesser believed that ''Sesame Street'' research "may have conferred a new respectability upon the studies of the effects of visual media upon children".&lt;ref name="lesser-235"/&gt;  He also believed that the show had the same effect on the prestige in the television industry of producing shows for children.&lt;ref name="lesser-235"/&gt; Historian Robert Morrow, in his book ''Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television'', which chronicled the show's influence on children's television and on the television industry as a whole, reported that many critics of commercial television saw ''Sesame Street'' as a "straightforward illustration for reform".&lt;ref name="morrow-122"/&gt;  [[Les Brown (writer)|Les Brown]], a writer for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', saw in ''Sesame Street'' "a hope for a more substantial future" for television.&lt;ref name="morrow-122"/&gt;

The networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many saw them as "appeasement gestures".&lt;ref name="morrow-127"/&gt;  In spite of the CTW's effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television "made only a limited effort to emulate CTW's methods", and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them.&lt;ref name="morrow-130"/&gt;  Morrow reported that by the mid-1970s, commercial television abandoned their experiments with creating better children's programming.&lt;ref name="morrow-132"/&gt;  Other critics hoped that ''Sesame Street'', with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers.&lt;ref name="morrow-124"/&gt;

As critic [[Richard Roeper]] has stated, perhaps one of the strongest indicators of the influence of ''Sesame Street'' have been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially about [[Bert and Ernie]].&lt;ref name="roeper"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Sesame Street'' was praised from its debut in 1969. ''Newsday'' reported that several newspapers and magazines had written "glowing" reports about CTW and co-creator [[Joan Ganz Cooney]].&lt;ref name="Seligsohn"/&gt; Although the series had been on the air for less than a year, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' featured Big Bird, who had received more fan mail than any of the show's human hosts, on its cover and declared, "&amp;nbsp;...It is not only the best children's show in TV history, it is one of the best parents' shows as well".&lt;ref name="bigbadtv"/&gt;  The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it.&lt;ref name="morrow"/&gt;  A 2010 survey found that most parents supported their children's viewing of ''Sesame Street'' and other PBS educational shows, and many educators used them as aides in the classroom.&lt;ref name="linebarger-63"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:25%; float:right; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"''Sesame Street'' is...with lapses, the most intelligent and important program in television. That is not anything much yet".
&lt;p align=right&gt;-[[Renata Adler]], ''The New Yorker'', 1972&lt;ref name="lesser-165"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Frost]] declared ''Sesame Street'' "a hit everywhere it goes".&lt;ref name="bigbadtv"/&gt; An executive at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], while recognizing that ''Sesame Street'' was not perfect, stated that the show "opened children's TV to taste and wit and substance"... and "made the climate right for improvement".&lt;ref name="bigbadtv"/&gt; By the end of the show's first season, ratings were high, the song "Rubber Duckie" was on the music charts for nine weeks, and Big Bird appeared on ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]''. Also in 1970, ''Sesame Street'' won twenty awards, including a [[Peabody Award]], three [[Emmy]]s, an award from the [[Public Relations Society of America]], a [[Clio]], and the Prix Jeunesse award.&lt;ref name="morrow-119"/&gt;  President [[Richard Nixon]] sent Cooney a congratulatory letter.&lt;ref name="bigbadtv"/&gt; [[Dr. Benjamin Spock]] predicted that the program would result in "better trained citizens, fewer unemployables in the next generation, fewer people on welfare, and smaller jail populations".&lt;ref name="davis-198"/&gt;  By 1995, the show had won two [[Peabody Awards]] and four [[Parents' Choice Award]]s. In addition, it was the subject of retrospectives at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="allshow"/&gt;  In 2011, puppeteer [[Kevin Clash]] was the subject of the documentary ''[[Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey]]''.  The documentary, directed by Constance Marks, received several awards, including the 2011 Black Film Critics Circle Award and the Special Jury Prize at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it premiered.&lt;ref name="docurama"/&gt;  By 2009, the series had received 118 [[Emmy Awards]], more than any other television series.&lt;ref name="emmys"/&gt;

''Sesame Street'' was not without its detractors, however. In May 1970, a state commission in [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting|Mississippi]] voted to exclude to host the show on its state educational TV network owing to concerns over the show's inclusive racial message. A member of the commission told the ''[[New York Times]],'' that "Mississippi was not yet ready" for the show's integrated cast.&lt;ref name="missban"/&gt;  Cooney called the commission's decision "a tragedy for both the white and black children of Mississippi".&lt;ref name="counts"/&gt; The Mississippi commission later reversed its decision, after the vote had made national news.

According to ''[[Children and Television]]'', Lesser's account of the development and early years of ''Sesame Street'', there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere, but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season. Lesser put the early criticism into four categories: educational goals, how the goals were chosen and obtained, the show's possible unintended effects, and its portrayal of minorities and women.&lt;ref name="lesser"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;See Lesser, pp. 175-201 for his response to the early critics of ''Sesame Street.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Robert W. Morrow suggested that much of the early criticism, which he called "surprisingly intense",&lt;ref name="morrow-3"/&gt; stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, "the place of children in American society and the controversies about television's effects on them".&lt;ref name="morrow-3"/&gt;

The "most important" studies that found negative effects of ''Sesame Street'' were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist [[Thomas D. Cook]] during its first two seasons. Both studies found that the show increased the educational gap between poor and middle-class children. Morrow reported that these studies had little impact on the public discussion about ''Sesame Street''.&lt;ref name="negative"/&gt;  Social scientist and [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] founder [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]] criticized the show for being too wholesome, stating, "The old, the ugly or the unwanted is simply made to disappear through a manhole".&lt;ref name="bigbadtv"/&gt; He also criticized the show for presenting bland and unrealistic characters, and for failing to teach children about social relationships and how to become a part of the society around them.&lt;ref name="morrow-145"/&gt;  Psychologist [[Leon Eisenberg]] saw ''Sesame Street's'' urban setting as "superficial" and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner-city child.&lt;ref name="Morrow, p. 98"/&gt;

Head Start director [[Edward Zigler]] was probably ''Sesame Street's'' most vocal critic in the show's early years. He withdrew Head Start's funding of the show, becoming the first of CTW's original investors to do so. Morrow stated that the basis of Zigler's criticism was concern that the federal government would transfer their funding of Head Start to CTW.&lt;ref name="morrow-147"/&gt;  Also according to Morrow, these studies were utilized by critics in ''Sesame Street's'' later years, especially by child development psychologists Jerome and Dorothy G. Singer, who insisted the television shortened children's attention spans, and by author [[Neil Postman]] in his book ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'', who believed that television could not teach children.&lt;ref name="morrow-149"/&gt;  Postman claimed that ''Sesame Street'' also introduced children to a shallow pop culture, undermined American education, and relieved parents of their responsibility of teaching their children how to read.&lt;ref name="davis-200"/&gt;

Since federal funds had been used to produce the show, more segments of the population insisted upon being represented on ''Sesame Street.'' Morrow credited CTW's commitment to multiculturalism as one source for their conflicts with the leadership of minority groups, especially Latino groups and feminists.  These conflicts were resolved when the CTW added or substituted offending segments and characters. By 1977, the cast consisted of two African American women, one of whom was single, two African American men, a Chicano man, two white men, an American Indian woman, a Puerto Rican woman, and a Deaf white woman.&lt;ref name="cast"/&gt;

[[File:Emilio Delgado.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Handsome Latino man in his late sixties, smiling at the camera and wearing a striped shirt.|[[Emilio Delgado]] (Luis), who joined the cast of ''Sesame Street'' in 1971]]

Latino groups criticized the show for the lack of Hispanic characters during its early years.&lt;ref name="counts"/&gt; A committee of Hispanic activists, commissioned by the CTW in 1970, called Sesame Street "racist" and said that the show's bilingual aspects were of "poor quality and patronizing".&lt;ref name="morrow-3"/&gt;  According to Morrow, Cooney admitted that the show's bilingual elements were "not well thought out".&lt;ref name="morrow-154"/&gt;  By 1971, the CTW hired Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers, and by the mid-70s, Morrow reported that "the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words".&lt;ref name="morrow-155"/&gt;  In 1989, ''Sesame Street'' created a four-year "race relations curriculum"&lt;ref name="truglio-69"/&gt; that focused on introducing its viewers to various cultural backgrounds.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that creating strong female characters "that make kids laugh, but not...as female stereotypes"&lt;ref name="gikow-142"/&gt; has been a challenge for the producers of ''Sesame Street''. Davis reported that the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) expressed concerns that the show needed to be "less male-oriented".&lt;ref name="bigbadtv"/&gt; Members of NOW were "rankled by the portrayal of Susan, whom they saw as a subservient, powerless dispenser of milk and cookies".&lt;ref name="davis-213"/&gt;  In the spring of 1970, ''[[Boston Globe]]'' columnist [[Ellen Goodman]] objected to what she considered ''Sesame Street's'' portrayal of women and girls as passive. In late 1970, the NOW threatened to boycott the show.&lt;ref name="morrow-156"/&gt;  The show's producers satisfied these critics by making Susan a nurse and by hiring a female writer.&lt;ref name="bigbadtv"/&gt;

According to Morrow, change regarding how women and girls were depicted on ''Sesame Street'' occurred slowly. CTW's research staff, which were mostly made up of women, worked with the mostly male production staff to raise their consciousnesses about how women and girls were portrayed in their scripts.&lt;ref name="morrow-156"/&gt; Another source of friction between the CTW and feminists were the lack of female [[Muppets]], for which they held [[Jim Henson]] responsible, as well as his organization of all-male puppeteers, who tended to create male characters. The demanding production schedule tended to attract only men, and Henson expressed his opinion that women were incapable of withstanding it.  Gikow believed that the difficulty creating breakout Muppet characters was due to children's viewing styles: girls have tended to become attached to male characters they like, but boys did not tend to form the same attachments to female characters.&lt;ref name="gikow-143"/&gt;  The show's inventory of material, some of which many feminists found sexist and which were shown over and over, were slowly replaced by new, less sexist segments.&lt;ref name="sexist"/&gt;  As more female Muppets performers like [[Fran Brill]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;Brill developed a solution to the height difference between the taller male puppeteers and her: wearing boots with 4–5&amp;nbsp;inches of platform glued to their soles. (See Gikow, p. 56)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]], and [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]] were hired and trained, stronger female characters like [[Abby Cadabby]] were created.&lt;ref name="gikow-143"/&gt; As an interesting contrast, ''Sesame Street'' was also chastised by a Louisiana critic for the presence of strong single women on the show.&lt;ref name="hellman"/&gt;

In 1995, journalist [[Kay Hymowitz]] called ''Sesame Street'' "a triumph of appearance over substance" and credited its success not with quality, but with "a combination of savvy timing, sophisticated image making, and vigorous promotion".&lt;ref name="allshow"/&gt; She held the show partly responsible for the declining verbal abilities of American students, and accused the show of affirming negative stereotypes about women. According to Hymowitz, the show's creators discouraged children's natural curiosity about the world. She criticized the show for, instead of transforming television, being "devoured"&lt;ref name="allshow"/&gt; by it. She took issue with its use of cultural references, stating that the show taught young children to embrace the negative values of commercialism, celebrity, and anti-intellectualism. She insisted that by using television's production values, the producers of ''Sesame Street'' emphasized their "jazzy medium"&lt;ref name="allshow"/&gt; more than the educational content they were supposed to convey. Hymowitz took issue with the show's educational claims, stating that ''Sesame Street'' diminished young children's readiness for reading by limiting their abilities to engage in analytical and creative thinking. She reported that most of the positive research conducted on the show has been done by the CTW, and then sent to a sympathetic press. She charged that the studies conducted by the CTW "hint at advocacy masquerading as social science".&lt;ref name="allshow"/&gt;

In 2003, one of ''Sesame Street's'' [[International co-productions of Sesame Street|international co-productions]], ''[[Takalani Sesame]]'', caused some controversy in the US when the first [[HIV]]-positive Muppet, [[Kami (Takalani Sesame)|Kami]], was created in response to [[South Africa|South Africa's]] [[AIDS]] epidemic. It marked the first time AIDS and the goal of confronting the disease's stigma was included in a preschool curriculum. According to the documentary, ''The World According to Sesame Street'', the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked ''Sesame Street'', Sesame Workshop, and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, "The reaction we got in the US blew me away. I didn't expect people to be so horrible... and hateful and mean".&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] and prominent minister and conservative political commentator [[Jerry Falwell]] praised the Workshop's efforts. Kami went on to be named [[UNICEF|UNICEF's]] Champion for Children in November 2003.&lt;ref name="kami"/&gt;

'''Information grazing''' refers to the ability to quickly obtain knowledge and facts just in time to solve new problems or answer questions. "Information grazing" can also be "information jumping", jumping from site to site and cherry-picking information seems to "rewire" the brain to deleterious effects or focus on something long enough to fully understand all its implications.&lt;ref name=managing&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seaward|first1=Brian|title=Managing stress|date=2011|publisher=Paramount Wellness Institute|location=Boulder, Colorado|edition=fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike traditional learning, where learning a subject in depth was necessary to draw enough pertinent knowledge to solve new problems or answer questions, information grazing assumes some subjects are so large, fast-changing, interdependent, or esoteric, that traditional methods of learning may be unable to solve new problems or answer questions as efficiently. Information grazing is also one of the most commonly used [[coping techniques]] for stress and experts have noticed a trend with people  many under the age of 35.&lt;ref name=managing/&gt;

The change from a traditional in-depth learning and memorizing of facts to a mentality of quickly finding, using, and then forgetting knowledge, stems from the [[technological singularity]] concept that information is growing so fast (see [[information explosion]] or [[information overload]]) that an individual can no longer hope to be a "[[Polymath|renaissance man]]" or effectively keep up with some fields of knowledge. Examples of fields of knowledge that are more susceptible to information grazing techniques are science and engineering, where the “newest” knowledge has become so dynamic, that documentation and dissemination has increasingly moved from fixed paper media to digital formats allowing easier updating and searchability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  With the advent of the [[Internet]] and modern computer-cataloging of libraries, vast sums of knowledge are easily accessible in overwhelming quantities in real time. And, with expected future advances in [[search engine technology]] and library services, the trend of information overload is expected{{By whom|date=April 2011}} to worsen; information grazing techniques will become more prevalent to deal with the overload.

Disadvantages of information grazing come from its advantages. Switching from a "fixed" source of information that is constant, verifiable, and worth memorizing to "fluid" sources that are always in flux can lead to quick solutions that are unverified or worse, incorrect. Studies have shown that many people don't read past the first sentences of a Web site's content, and many never go beyond the first ten links listed in a search.&lt;ref name=managing/&gt; As information becomes more like an instantaneous consumable item, memorization is less fact-based but more procedural (i.e. how to find it). Similar concepts are found in Japanese education where after intense study of many unconnected facts, most of the information is forgotten or if remembered, not connected to other relevant facts. In the USA, this is similar to [[Cramming (memorization)|cramming]] an exam. Information grazing may have the same effect but greater, since it is done over the period of years.

'''LAC Group''', formerly known as Library Associates Companies (LAC), is a library services vendor, providing [[Employment agency|staffing]], [[Recruitment|recruiting]], consulting, and other services, to [[Academic library|academic]], [[Public library|public]], [[special library|special]],
[[Medical library|medical]], and [[Law library|law]] libraries. LAC Group's service lines of business include: Consulting &amp; Project Management, Information &amp; Asset Management, Library Staffing &amp; Research Services, Legal Staffing, Managed Services, and Recruiting.

==History==
LAC Group was founded in 1986 by Deb Schwarz as a [[Employment agency|staffing agency]] specializing in law libraries.&lt;ref name="llrx.com"&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/outsourcing.htm Features - Outsourcing in Law Firm Libraries | LLRX.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517012126/http://www.llrx.com/features/outsourcing.htm |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_33_26/ai_n6176508 |title=Shelf wealth: Deborah Schwarz started her career as a librarian without enough work to fill the day; now she's expanding her outsourcing service |work=Los Angeles Business Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050520211457/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_33_26/ai_n6176508 |archivedate=2005-05-20 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

By 1989, it was offering [[Library technical services|technical services]] and serving other academic and other special 
libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalogingandclassificationquarterly.com/ccq23nr2news.html CCQ Vol. 23, Nr. 2 Cataloging News Cataloging News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, Library Associates caused a stir in library circles and gained national attention when they were selected by [[Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman|Pillsbury Madison &amp; Sutro LLP]] to manage their library operations.&lt;ref name="llrx.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/pms.htm Features - Outsourcing a Private Law Library: In Defense of the Pillsbury, Madison &amp; Sutro Decision | LLRX.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015142908/http://www.llrx.com/features/pms.htm |date=2008-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company continued its expansion into different markets with its acquisition of Medical Library Consultants (MLC) from Betsey Beamish in 2001&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; and of Sanad Support Technologies from Jodi 
and Fuad Suleiman in 2003.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://units.sla.org/chapter/cpnw/interface/2003/fall/news.html sla || pnw || interface || fall 2003 || news&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722143443/http://units.sla.org/chapter/cpnw/interface/2003/fall/news.html |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the acquisition of Sanad, Library Associates consisted of two divisions, Library Associates and Library Associates of Maryland. In 2007, the divisions were integrated and the company name was changed to Library Associates Companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3014">'''Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web''' is an international [[database]] of [[online exhibition]]s which is a service of the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]].
==Overview==
Two categories of online exhibitions are included in the database: exhibitions created by [[libraries]], [[archives]], [[historical societies]], and other scholarly institutions; and [[museum]] exhibitions with major emphasis on library and archival materials.

Several of these online exhibitions were originally created to accompany exhibitions physically situated at their respective institutions, but a growing percentage exist solely in [[Digital library|remotely accessible]] format. The database is searchable by title, subject, and sponsoring institution.

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2011}}
The website is based on an online guide to library exhibits on the web, created by Andrea Bean Hough in 1995. The guide was maintained by the [[University of Houston]] Libraries until it had grown to some 350 links in 1998–99 and staffing considerations made it necessary for the University to discontinue participation in the project. Since then, the guide has been curated by Diane Shaw, Special Collections Librarian at the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]]. As of 2011, it has grown to include over 6,000 links to online exhibitions.

==Recognition==
[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]], a publication of the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]], awarded ''Editor's Pick'' to the database in August 2010, saying it was "the most comprehensive source for existing digital exhibitions."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://library.utpb.edu/Choice-HiRecom.html Choice Highly Recommended Academic Web Sites]'', [[University of Texas of the Permian Basin]], The J. Conrad Dunagan Library Online. Retrieved September 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also listed under ''Best of the Web'' by [[New York Public Library]] and had previously been rewarded ''Site of the Month'' by ''LibrarySpot''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nypl.org/weblinks/2166 Best of the Web]'', [[New York Public Library]], USA. Retrieved August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.libraryspot.com/lsom/1999/libsiteofmonth0799.htm Congratulations to Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web]'', [http://www.libraryspot.com/ Library Spot].

** Permanent residents who can prove they have applied for citizenship. Or permanent residents who are ineligible to apply for Australian citizenship as long as they are prepared to apply for citizenship within 3 months of commencing service (or 6 months if in the ADF Reserve). If permanent residents refuse citizenship or fail in their application, their ADF service will be terminated.
** Overseas applicants with relevant military experience from allied countries who have significant military experience can apply to join the Armed Forces. A willingness to apply for citizenship is a requirement. In exceptional circumstances, if a position cannot be filled by an Australian Citizen the citizenship requirement may be waived and applications may be accepted from:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/defence/defence-hunting-foreign-troops-with-citizenship-for-service/story-e6frg8yo-1226230857780|title = Defence hunting foreign troops with citizenship for service|last = Nicholson|first = Brendan|date = December 27, 2011|work = |access-date = July 18, 2015|via = |newspaper = [[The Australian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain areas of the defence, especially sensitive work that involves collaboration with [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|ASIO]] or [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service|ASIS]], citizenship is a requirement.&lt;ref name="defencejobs.gov.au"/&gt;

** The [[Bahrain Defence Force|forces in Bahrain]] are made up of Sunni foreigners, mainly Arabs and Pakistanis serving within them.

** [[Canadian Forces]] - Canadian permanent residents are allowed to serve in the Canadian Forces (CF) as long as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) decides it would not prejudice the national interest. It is likely that a requirement of CF membership will be to aim to become a Canadian citizen within four years of enrollment (subject to Citizenship and Immigration Canada's (CIC) processing timeframes).  Following changes to the Citizenship Act in 2015, there is also now a fast-track citizenship scheme available to current and past CF members, as well as certain prospective members (negating the requirement to become a permanent resident first in the latter case).

** Foreign nationals already living in Denmark or in another EU country may apply to join the Danish armed forces, providing they have lived one year in Denmark if applying within or six years if applying within an EU country.

'''Wu''' ({{zh|c=巫|p=''wū''|w=''wu''|l=[[shaman]]}}) '''shaman''' are spirit mediums who have practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing in Chinese traditions dating back over 3,000 years. Various [[Wu (shaman)|wu shaman]] are known from thousands of years of Chinese folk religion, mythology, and poetry. Individually and collectively they form an important part of the world's cultural heritage.

==Word ''wu''==
[[File:巫-seal.svg|thumb|Chinese [[Seal script]] for ''wu'' 巫 "shaman"]]
{{Main|Wu (shaman)}}
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''wu'' 巫 "spirit medium; shaman; shamaness; sorcerer; doctor; proper names" was first recorded during the [[Shang dynasty]] (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), when a ''wu'' could be either sex. ''Shaman'' is the common English translation of Chinese ''wu'', but some scholars (de Groot 1910, Mair 1990:35) maintain that the Siberian ''shaman'' and Chinese ''wu'' were historically and culturally different shamanic traditions. [[Arthur Waley]] (1955:9) defines ''wu'' as "spirit-intermediary" and says, "Indeed the functions of the Chinese ''wu'' were so like those of Siberian and Tunguz shamans that it is convenient (as has indeed been done by Far Eastern and European writers) to use shaman as a translation of ''wu''. In contrast, Schiffeler (1976:20) describes the "untranslatableness" of ''wu'', and prefers using the romanization "''wu'' instead of its contemporary English counterparts, "witches," "warlocks," or "shamans"," which have misleading connotations. Taking ''wu'' to mean "female shaman", [[Edward H. Schafer]] translates it as (1951:153) "shamaness" and (1980:11) "shamanka". The transliteration-translation "''wu'' shaman" or "''wu''-shaman" (Unschuld 1985:344) implies "Chinese" specifically and "shamanism" generally. ''Wu'', concludes Falkenhausen (1995:280), "may be rendered as "shaman" or, perhaps, less controversially as "spirit medium"." Paper (1995:85) criticizes "the majority of scholars" who use one word ''shaman'' to translate many Chinese terms (''wu'' 巫, ''xi'' 覡, ''yi'' 毉, ''xian'' 仙, and ''zhu'' 祝), and writes, "The general tendency to refer to all ecstatic religious functionaries as shamans blurs functional differences." The word "shaman" is often pluralized as "shamans", especially in old school sources, but may also be formed into a plural without morphological change, as just "shaman". The ''-man'' ending is distinct from the English word "man", referring to a human being, although some speakers may treat it as such.

==''Li Sao'' shaman list==
In the [[Li Sao|''Li Sao'']], two individual shaman are specified.

*Ling Fen (靈氛)
*Wu Xian (巫咸)
:::(Hawkes:45, note 9)

This Wu Xian may or may not be the same as the (one or more) historical person(s) named [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]]. Hawkes suggests an equation of the word ''ling'' in the Chu dialect with the word ''wu''.(46 and 84)

==''Shanhaijing'' 6 list==
In some cases, the individual wu shaman are known from sources, such as the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (''Classic of Mountains and Seas''). The name of some individual shaman includes "Wu" (巫) in the normal position of the family surname, for example, in the case of the following list, where the 6 are depicted together reviving a corpse, with Wu Peng holding the Herb of Immortality.(Hawkes:45 and 230-231):

*Wu Yang (巫陽, "Shaman Bright")
*Wu Peng (巫彭)
*Wu Di (巫抵)
*Wu Li (巫履) [Tang reconstruction *Lǐ, Hanyu Pinyin Lǚ]
*Wu Fan (巫凡)
*Wu Xiang (巫相)

Wu Peng and Wu Yang and others are also known from the ''Chu Ci'' poetry anthology. Wu Yang is the major speaker in ''[[Zhao Hun]]'' (also known as, ''Summons for the Soul'').

==''Shanhaijing'' 10 list==
The Lingshan 10 are:

*Wu Xian (巫咸)
*Wu Ji (巫即)
*Wu Fen (or Ban) (巫肦)
*Wu Peng (巫彭)
*Wu Gu (巫姑)
*Wu Zhen (巫真)
*Wu Li (巫禮)
*Wu Di (巫抵)
*Wu Xie (巫謝)
*Wu Luo (巫羅)

[[File:Gersaint.jpg|thumb|[[Edme-François Gersaint]]'s shop, in [[Antoine Watteau]]'s ''[[L'Enseigne de Gersaint]]'', in form a shop sign, though never used as such.]]
A '''''marchand-mercier'''''&lt;ref&gt;The role of ''marchands-merciers'' was outlined by Louis Courajod in his edition of the day-book of [[Lazare Duvaux]] (1873), more firmly sketched by Pierre Verlet, "Le commerce des objets d'art et les marchands merciers à Paris au XVIIIe siècle", ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' '''13'''.1 (January/March 1958:10-29) and has been recently analyzed by Carolyn Sargentson, ''Merchants and Luxury Markets: The Marchands Merciers of Eighteenth-Century Paris'' (Victoria and Albert Museum) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[French language|French]] term for a type of entrepreneur working outside the [[guild]] system of craftsmen but carefully constrained by the regulations of a ''corporation'' under rules codified in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;The rules were confirmed, without change, in August 1643 and were maintained until the Revolution: [[Daniel Roche (historian)|Daniel Roche]],  (tr. [[Arthur Goldhammer]]) , ''France in the Enlightenment'' (1993) 1998
Cambridge, Mass, and London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduplicative term&lt;ref&gt;"Par un pléonasme, qui paraît presque volontaire, ils s'appelaient ''marchands-merciers'', ''mercatores-mercatores''" (Verlet 1958:10)&lt;/ref&gt; literally means a merchant of merchandise, but in the 18th century took the connotation of a merchant of ''[[Objet d'art|objets d'art]]''.  Earliest references to this ''Corps de la Ville de Paris'' can be found at the close of the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Joanny, ''Régistre des délibérations et ordonnances des marchands-merciers de Paris 1596-1696'' (Paris) 1878, noted in Verlet 1958:10 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 18th century marchands-merciers were shopkeepers but they also played an important role in the decoration of Paris homes. In fact, they served as general contractors, designing and commissioning pieces of the most fashionable furniture, and often, in addition, worked outside of their shops as [[interior decorator]]s, responsible for many aspects of a room's decor. In Paris, the guild system, in place since the late Middle Ages, prohibited craftsmen from working with any material with which they had not undergone a formal [[apprenticeship]]. Only a marchand-mercier who worked outside of the guild system, therefore, could mount Chinese [[porcelain]]s with gilt-bronze handles and stands, fit the [[cabinetmaker]]'s furniture with Japanese [[lacquer]] or [[Sèvres porcelain]] plaques, and supply furniture with opulent gilt-bronze (or [[ormolu]]) mounts.&lt;ref&gt;There were certain cabinetmakers who, by license of the king, could overcome by patent their status as non- Parisian "foreigners" and work outside of the strictly limiting  guild system, ''suivant le Cour", "following the Court".&lt;/ref&gt;

The general lines permitted to their ''métier'' were set out under Charles IX, in 1570, as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Wholesale merchants, drapers and jewelers, in such way that under this status of wholesaler (''estat de grossier'') have been included at all times the merchants of [[cloth of gold]], of silver, of silk... [[Tapestry|tapestries]], jewellery, spiced goods, textiles, hammered copper, silk thread, hardware and the like, of which it is not permitted to have any manufacture whatsoever, but only to sell, buy, display, bedeck and beautify all kinds of merchandise"&lt;ref&gt;"marchans&lt;!--marchans in original--&gt; grossiers, merciers et jouailliers, de manière que soubs cet estat de grossier ont esté comprins&lt;!--comprins in original--&gt; de tout temps les marchans de drap d'or, d'argent, de soie... tapisseries, jouailleries, espiceries, merceries, cuivres de forge, fil de soye, quinqualleries, et autres semblables, auxquels il n'est permis de faire manufactures quelconque, mais seulement de vendre, achepter, estaller, parer et enjolliver de toutes espèces de marchandise"; quoted in Verlet 1958:11.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus the ''marchands-merciers'' were characterised in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' as "sellers of everything, makers of nothing"".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire des sciences'',... ("Neuchâtel", 1765) vol. 10:360, noted in Verlet 1958:11 note 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Savary des Bruslons]] elaborated this lapidary remark and revealed the disdain of his generation towards handcrafts: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This Corporation is considered the noblest and most excellent of all the Corporations of Merchants, all the more because those who compose it do not labour at all and make no handiwork, if it were not to beautify those things that are already made and manufactured"&lt;ref&gt;''"Ce Corps est consideré comme le plus noble et les plus excellent de tous de les Corps des Marchands, d'autant que ceux qui le composent ne travaillent point et ne font aucun ouvrage de la main, si ce n'est pour enjoliver les choses qui se sont déjà faîtes et fabriquées''", Savary, ''Dictionnaire universel du commerce...'' 1761, quoted in Verlet 1958:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though they were confined by law to no narrow specialisation, the Parisian ''marchands-merciers'' followed narrow fields— Savary distinguished twenty— following the usages of their training and their connections, in highly competitive fields dominated by fashion. Among them a small group of ''marchands-merciers'' specialised in works of art, catering to an elite circle of connoisseurs and collectors towards the middle of the 18th century, when a vogue for exoticism expressed itself in ''[[chinoiserie]]''.  Savary's ''Dictionnaire'' detailed the wares of:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"those who sell pictures, prints, candelabras, wall-lights, girandoles of gilded brass and [patinated] bronze, crystal chandeliers, figures of bronze, marble, wood and other material; cabinets, coffers, armoires, table, little tables, and candlestands put together of wood and gilded, marble tables and other merchandise and curiosities proper for the ornament of lodgings." &lt;ref&gt;"''ceux qui vendent des tableaux, des estampes, des candelabras, des bras, des girandoles de cuivre doré et de bronze, des lustres de cristal, les figures de bronze, de marbre, de bois et d'autre matière, des pendules, horloges et montres; des cabinets, coffres, armoires, tables, tablettes, et gueridons de bois de raport et doré, des tables de marbre et autre marchandises et curiosités propres pour l'ornement des appartemens''"; quoted in Verlet 1958:14f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These entrepreneurs helped guide and even create fashions, such as that for Chinese porcelains, mounted in purely French [[gilt bronze]], transforming a vase into a [[ewer]] with rococo lip and handle, or reversing one bowl over another, with an open-work gilt-bronze rim, to function as a perfume-burner. Only a ''marchand-mercier'' could marshal the resources required to create such objects.&lt;ref&gt;"In the compartmentalization imposed by the guild system, the merchants were the only ones who could coordinate the lasbour of various trades (Verlet 1958:18).&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Marchands-merciers'' bought Japanese lacquer screens and boxes, had them dismantled and their wooden backing shaved down, then commissioned ''[[ébéniste]]s'' like [[Bernard II Vanrisamberg]] or [[Joseph Baumhauer]] to produce furniture veneered with exotic lacquer panels shaped to fit the complex curves of Louis XV surfaces, and perhaps completed with French imitations, or entirely japanned in [[Vernis Martin]], which might imitate Chinese blue and white porcelain decors, such as the blue-on-white ensemble of furniture Hébert delivered in 1743 for [[Louise Julie de Mailly|Mme de Mailly]]&lt;ref&gt;Verlet 1958:18, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''marchands-merciers'' on French porcelain is also considerable. [[Lazare Duvaux]] alone bought three-fifths of the ''total output'' of Sèvres in 1757, representing a total of 165,876 ''livres''.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet 1958:19.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain forms in the Sèvres archives carry the names of well-known ''marchands-merciers'' in their designations.

Membership in the ''corps'' was carefully controlled. A new member, born in France, had to undergo an [[apprenticeship]] of three years, followed by another three as a ''compagnon'', during which time he was bound to remain unmarried. His master could take on but one apprentice at a time, and the apprenticeships were duly enregistred at the corporation's offices in rue du Petit-Lion (rue Quincampoix). A sum changed hands, estimated by Guillaume Glorieux as averaging about 1720  500 or 600 ''livres'', and a larger sum was owed to the ''corporation'' when the individual was received master (''maîtris''), some 1700 ''livres''.&lt;ref&gt;Glorieux, ''À l'Enseigne de Gersaint: Edme-François Gersaint, marchand d'art sur le Pont Notre-Dame'', Paris, 2002:23, 136, 140; Glorieux's immediate context is the apprenticeship contract of [[Edme-François Gersaint]] in 1716; he discusses the ''corps des marchands merciers'' pp 136ff.&lt;/ref&gt; There were two exceptions to this rule, made for purveyors to the Court— ''marchands privilégié suivant le cour''— by decree of the king, and for those who married the daughter of one of the accredited merchants.

The Parisian ''marchands-merciers'' congregated in [[rue Saint-Honoré]], marking their establishments with catchy and amusing signs; there could be found the premises of Hébert, [[Simon-Philippe Poirier]]— and later at the same premises ''at the sign of the Golden Crown'' his partner [[Dominique Daguerre]] and Martin-Eloi Lignereux— Mme Dulac, Julliot, Lebrun ''at the King of the Indies'' and Tuard ''au [[château de Bellevue]]''. Nearby, in rue de la Monnaie, the street where the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|manufacture royale of Sèvres]] eventually chose to open its porcelain shop, were Darnault, father and son, at the ''sign of the King of Spain'', and [[Lazare Duvaux]]. Edme-François Gersaint, for whom [[Watteau]] painted ''[[L'Enseigne de Gersaint]]'' as a [[shop sign]] had premises, following an old tradition, in a house on the [[Pont Notre-Dame]]. There, he advertised in  1740, he
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sells all sorts of new and tasteful hardware (''Cainquaillerie''), trinkets, mirrors, cabinet pictures,&lt;ref&gt;''Peintures de cabinet'' connote small, intimately scaled, highly finished paintings suited for appreciation in a private [[Cabinet (room)|cabinet]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''pagods'',&lt;ref&gt;A generic term for Far Eastern figures, rather than [[pagoda]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; lacquer and porcelain from Japan, shellwork and other specimens of natural history, stones, agates, and generally all curious and exotic merchandise".&lt;ref&gt;"''Vend toute sort de clainquaillerie&lt;!--clainquaillerie in original--&gt; nouvelle et de goût, bijoux, glaces, tableaux de cabinet, pagodes, vernis et porcelaines du Japon, coquillages et autres morceaux d'histoire naturelle, cailloux, agathes, et généralement toutes marchandises curieuses et étrangères"''; quoted in Verlet 1958:16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A newcomer, Granchet, opened premises ''Au petit Dunkerque'', in the Left Bank, Quai Conti at the far end of the [[Pont Neuf]].&lt;ref&gt;These locations are given in Verlet 1958:15&lt;/ref&gt;

Among these entrepreneurial dealers and [[interior decorator]]s at the apex of their profession, towards the middle of the century Hébert achieved the greatest celebrity,&lt;ref&gt;So suggests Verlet 1958:13ff.&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in the popular novel ''Thémidore'' (1745) and marrying his daughter to the son of the [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1731–1767)|Dauphine]]'s first ''femme de chambre'' in 1751, in a contract signed at Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;And noted in his ''Mémoires'' by the [[Charles Philippe d'Albert de Luynes|duc de Luynes]], observing that she was likely to bring him ''beaucoup de bien'' (noted by Verlet 1958:13).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Maya civilization}}
In [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]], ceremonial dance had great importance. However, since dance is a transient [[art]], it is inherently difficult for [[Archaeology|archeologist]]s to find and evaluate evidence of its role. There is little material information left behind, beyond a few paintings on murals and vases. This lack of direct evidence leads to several different archaeological interpretations.

[[Dance]] was a central component of social, religious, and political endeavors for the ancient [[Maya peoples|Maya]]. The entire community danced, including [[ajaw|kings]], [[Nobility|nobles]], and common people. Dance served many functions such as creating [[Hierotopy|sacred space]], closing the gap between here and the otherworld, and releasing the dead from the grasp of the Xibalbans (see [[Xibalba]]).

==Research==
In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] and [[Elizabeth P. Benson]] described a dancing scene showing several important [[lord]]s standing with one heel raised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1992, [[Nikolai Grube]] deciphered the [[glyph]] for “dance” (read as ''ak’ot'') in [[Maya script]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some interesting depictions of Maya dance of the Classic era are found on [[Maya ceramics]] and in the famous murals of [[Bonampak]].

The word was in a picture that depicts [[Bird Jaguar IV]], a [[Yaxchilan]] ruler, in a pose that would be described as dancing holding a writhing snake. The words around the man read chan chan or “celestial snake”. Many of the texts or stelae would be installed on places that the performance the picture had captured would be ideally done at like platforms, plazas or stairways.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Looper, George, Matthew. (2009) ''To Be Like Gods, Dancing in Ancient Maya Civilization''. University of Texas Press,&lt;/ref&gt;

Dancing on designs has been hard to find at first. It has been discovered that pictures of people dancing have been found to be standing still in the pictures or with a leg raised and just barely touching the ground. The physical location of where the image is gives hints to its reason. Symbols around and in the image also give helpful hints to the decoding of the image. Some depictions of dances come in a story like format around temples, like the 40 days after Bird Jaguar IV’s accession which spans many panels and includes a few different temples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Technique==
Ancient Maya dance is often characterized by transformations of human beings into supernatural (god like) beings by means of visionary [[altered state of consciousness|trance]].  Some think that [[Hallucinogen|hallucinogenic drugs]] or  medicines were used to put the performer into an altered state of [[mind]]. Once in this state of mind the participants were transformed into their ''[[wayob]]'' or soul companions. These [[soul]] companions were depicted through the [[mask]]s and the costumes people wore in the dance. Some scenes are painted on [[pottery]] such as that from the myriad ritual meals of Classic festivals. These vessels depict humans, both kings and nobles, dressed in costumes.  Their human faces are shown in cutaway view inside the costumes of the fantastic creatures they have become through the transformation of the dance. Some of these ''wayob'' are recognizable as animals like [[jaguar]]s and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]], but others just look like strange [[monster]]s.

For the Maya, dance was a very public affair. It induced visionary trances where either individuals or groups went into an altered state of mind that allowed them to communicate with the other world. Those who were strong enough to travel there, told stories about how the land had things like [[river]]s and [[tree]]s in this [[earth|world]]. Some of the great lords depicted themselves dancing out over the [[abyss (religion)|abyss]] that leads into the otherworld.

The distinction between the humans and [[supernatural]] beings was never sharply made. Through dance, [[people]] became [[god]]s and gods became people even if it were only for a moment. It is important to note that these were more than just acts of civic [[pride]] or [[piety]]. They were considered to be direct connections to the otherworld.

With the written form of dance poses play a big part on how they describe and depict the dance. The gesture of holding the double headed serpent would be described as a gesture of concentration, calm and tranquility. The pose to dancing was discovered to be a lifted heel while still touching the ground. This was discovered in 1911 but wasn’t brought to questions till 1981 by Virginia Miller who defined the pose. This pose was started in the Early Classic period on a small scale while in the eight century started to appear in large scale depiction. This pictures show one heel raised, very rarely is both raised, and the arms in a dynamic pose with the body gazing outwards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview==
Dance from pre-Columbian Maya culture still exists in various altered forms today. However, dancing in the ancient world carried a much deeper significance in their sophisticated culture. Records of these dances have come to light through various [[mural]]s, codices, and especially the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] who first recorded their observations. 
	
[[Spirit]]s of the super-natural world and their relationship with [[Maya civilization|Maya culture]] played an important role in [[ritual]] dance. Just as well, [[Megafauna|beasts]] were usually [[Mimicry|mimicked]] in ceremonial dance. The attire worn to some dances as depicted in murals show the links Maya dancers make to the natural world and to their worshipped gods who often took the form of animals. This is evident especially in the frescoes of [[Bonampak]].
	
The elements as well were worshipped through Maya dance. In the [[Tz'utujil people|Tzutujil]] Maya culture, it was believed that a spirit controlled the power of [[volcano]]es. When the [[mountain]] began to grumble and shake, the Tzutujil [[priest]]s would pick young women and [[girl]]s who would partake in a large dance ceremony before being sacrificed into the burning mountain. Maya dance rituals often included [[sacrifice]]. For instance, the Tun-teleche¬ dance included victims whose [[heart]]s were removed before they died as a gift to [[underworld]] [[demon]]s. On the other hand, some public ritual dances were even [[Eroticism|erotic]] in nature. Common throughout most all dances though was the importance of [[Maya death gods|deities]] and the relationship between man and god.  
	
Dancing includes many different aspects of other rituals into the moves and actions they do during them. [[Bloodletting|Blood-letting]] was used to help demonstrate the bravery of the warriors. They would also put their captives in their dances; the captives would be killed in a public ritual normally after the bloodletting. Ball games were also involved in dances. Some ball players would be in similar positions as dancers’ sometimes confusing people analyzing them . Instruments were also including in depictions of ball games further supporting the connection of dancing, ball games, and warfare are connected in the life style as they all share very similar depictions of what they are.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
	
In the [[Creation myth|book of creation]], ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', it is recounted that the dances of the Twin Brothers were part of a miracle ceremony. Just as well, the dances of ‘[[Armadillo|The Armadillo]],’
‘[[Nightjar|the Poorwill]],’ and ‘[[Weasel|the Weasel]]’ pleased the lords of [[death]] immensely.
	
Dance in Maya culture has also acted as a bridge between the ancient and post-Columbian eras. [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish missionaries and lords]] as late as the 18th century were trying to eliminate the practice of ancient dance; however, natives maintained roots with their [[ancestor]]s by practicing in secret. Even after the relatively complete conversion to [[Catholicism]] after the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] influence arrived, Maya people still respect their ancient deities through ceremonial dance, which has persisted through the generations since the golden age of ancient Maya.

== Writing of Dance ==
The “stepping” pose is also closely connected to dance. This pose is a profile of the person with their right foot on the ground while the left is bent with the ball if the foot on the ground. This pose uses lots of context to discover the meaning. This pose could also be used for walking but the presence of instruments and dance costumes separate the two from each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The legs aren’t the only part of the body that mattered when it comes to dance poses. The arm and elbow were used while the hand and fingers are not always shown  while almost all people are shown with arms. One dance position of the arms is the arms out towards the way the person is facing or next to the face while another one is a hand by the head with the other on the hip. The arms would be used of the artist didn’t want to raise the heel of the person while still giving the [[symbol]] of dance. The use of just arms as a form of dance is used to show the dancing of someone who isn’t normally a dancer, like a baby or a [[Gods|god]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With all things there are situations that break the pattern. If the poses for dance are used without certain contexts the meanings of these poses changes. A lifted heel without [[Musical instrument|instruments]] or dance costumes could be used to describe [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]]. Warriors and battles also use this pose as a sign to capture enemies as well as to signal a [[spear]] being thrown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Meanings within dances==
The Snake Dance was also celebrated by the lords of [[Palenque]]. This time the dance was done with a male who has an ax in one hand and a serpent in the other, and a woman who is grasping the lower body of the snake.  These dancers wore costumes of [[First father]] and [[First Mother]], the deities whose actions enabled the final [[Creation myth|creation]] and the birth of all the [[gods]]. This depiction is thought to point toward the role of dance in the story of Creation.

The most important instrument of mayan music is the rain stick.

The story of the [[Popol Vuh]] exhibits examples of this idea.  After the [[Hero Twins]] are killed they come back to life as vagabonds and quickly enchant the people of [[Xibalba]] with their dancing and magic.  The Twins danced such dances as the Dance of the [[Poorwill]], the [[Weasel]] and the [[Armadillo]] and they are able to bring things back to life.  All of this fame caught the attention of the [[Lords of Death]] who command the Twins to perform.  As the twins perform, the Lords are amazed by their powers and finally ask the Twins to sacrifice them.  The Twins do, but this time they do not bring them back to life, limiting the Xibalbans power over humans forever.

Dancers are very specific on where they do their rituals. Certain dances are more private while other are public events that fill stadiums. One [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[Exploration|explorer]] describes a performance he watched as eight hundred heavy warriors danced in a giant stadium. Not one of the warriors were off beat as they danced all day with food and drink brought to them as they danced. Diego Garcia de Palacio compared a courtyard enclosed by stairways in [[Copán|Copan]] to the [[Colosseum]] in Rome. Dances were mostly public rituals showing community by people being different social classes on stage. These stages were normally large centers, public zones or palace compounds which the elites would use more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Much of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ceremonial architecture contains pieces of art containing figures doing ritual dances. The architect of these building holds figures of what the rooms are normally used for. Some set of staircase contain pictures of captives walking down them giving the idea the rooms here were used to store prisoners. The East Court of the [[Acropolis]] in Copan is believed to have been used for dance rituals. The room was used by a dictionary of colonial Yucatec described the acropolis as a community house where they learned to discuss public interest and well as learn to dance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Michael Dickinson''' (born 1950, [[Durham, England|Durham]]) is an English artist known for his work in Turkey, who works with political and satirical [[collage]]s. In 2008, he was prosecuted for a collage of the Turkish prime minister, but acquitted.&lt;ref name=tait&gt;Tait, Robert.

==Life and work==
Michael Dickinson was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]], England, and spent most of his early years in [[Kuwait]], where his father was an employee of the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] and where he attended the Anglo-American School.&lt;ref name=timessatire&gt;Alberge, Dalya and Erdem, Suna (2006).

===Collage banned by Tripod===

In May 2005, Dickinson's web site, "The Carnival of Chaos", was blanked and he was informed by the host Tripod (a member of the [[Lycos]] group), "You are no longer an authorized member of Tripod. You have been removed because your web site violated our Terms of Service."&lt;ref name=banned&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Dickinson/Index.html "The Carnival of Chaos banned"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 12 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after he had posted a collage, ''Tyrant's Pants'', showing President Bush in his underpants with a cruise missile coming out of his rear and a [[swastika]] on his right buttock.&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;&lt;ref name=banned/&gt;

[[File:Tyrant's-Pants.jpg|thumb|upright|''Tyrant's Pants'' collage by Michael Dickinson showing President Bush]]
The collage was a response to a photo which had appeared with the headline "Tyrant's in his pants" on the front page of the British tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', showing captive [[Saddam Hussein]] in underpants.&lt;ref name=banned/&gt;

===Turkish court case===

In June 2006, [[Istanbul]] police removed one of Dickinson's collages from a show in the city organised by the Global Peace and Justice Coalition.&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt; Dickinson states that he hung his work in the show unknown to the organisers.&lt;ref name=guardianbriton&gt;Birch, Nicholas.

"It’s such an Alice in Wonderland feeling. The law is so absurd ... This law exists in Turkey about insulting 'Turkishness' or the State. You’re not allowed to state your opinion."&lt;ref name=timessatire/&gt;

In September 2006, Dickinson attended the trial of Erkan Kara, organiser of the Global Peace and Justice Coalition show, charged with insulting behaviour for exhibiting Dickinson's work. The prosecutor described Dickinson as "ill-intentioned", but declined to bring a case because of "lack of evidence".&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt; Hasan Gungor of the Istanbul-based group,  Initiative for Freedom of Speech, attributed this to fear of international news, when the [[European Union]] has concerns over freedom of speech in Turkey.&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt;

[[File:Michael Dickinson. Good Boy.jpg|thumb|''Good Boy'' by Michael Dickinson. He was prosecuted for its display.]]
Members of Global Peace and Justic Coalition remonstrated with Dickinson for distracting attention from their anti-[[Iraq War]] cause, and he then held up another collage showing Erdogan as a dog with a lead of the [[Flag of the United States|stars and stripes]]; he was arrested and charged with insulting the Turkish prime minister's dignity&lt;ref name=guardianbriton/&gt; with a trial date scheduled for October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Duff, Oliver.

In July 2007, Dickinson's collages were displayed at the [[A Gallery]], London, in the Stuckist show ''I Won't Have Sex with You as long as We're Married''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/AGalleryJuly07/IndexShow.html "I won't have sex with you as long as we're married"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 2 September 2007. Photos of the collages in the A Gallery show.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2008, he was acquitted of any crime, the judge ruling that although there were "some insulting elements" in his collage, it fell "within the limits of criticism".&lt;ref name=tait/&gt; The case has favourable implications for Turkey's relationship with the [[European Union]], which had called for an improvement of its human rights record.&lt;ref name=tait/&gt; Dickinson said, "I am lucky to be acquitted. There are still artists in Turkey facing prosecution and being sentenced for their opinions."&lt;ref name=tait/&gt;

In June 2009, Dickinson fled Turkey for his native country, Britain, after learning that his acquittal had been overturned. Unable to find work, he returned to Istanbul soon after. In January 2010, a Turkish court convicted Dickinson of mocking the Turkish prime minister and levied a fine.   Refusing to pay the fine as a matter of principle, Dickinson faces up to two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

Retrieved 31 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His final sentencing will occur at a trial on 9 March 2010.

Dickinson's application for a residence permit was refused due to his 2010 conviction, but he remained in the country after the expiry of his tourist visa. He was arrested in October 2013 for shouting [[Gezi Park]]-related slogans at police, and detained after his expired visa was discovered. He was deported after some days (and banned from returning for five years), choosing to go to Barcelona rather than his native Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dickinson, ''CounterPunch'', 1 November 2013, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/11/01/tossed-out-of-turkey-after-twenty-seven-years/ Tossed Out Of Turkey After Twenty Seven Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modern sculpture''' is generally considered to have begun with the work of [[Auguste Rodin]], who is seen as the progenitor of modern [[sculpture]]. While Rodin did not set out to rebel against the past, he created a new way of building his works.&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, Albert E. (2003). ''Rodin's Art: The Rodin Collection of the Iris &amp; Gerald B. Cantor Center for the Visual Arts''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513381-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.psmuseum.org/exhibitions/upcoming_exhibition_new.php Rodin to Now: Modern Sculpture]", Palm Springs Desert Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; He "dissolved the hard outline of contemporary Neo-Greek academicism, and thereby created a vital synthesis of opacity and transparency, volume and void".&lt;ref&gt;Giedion-Welcker, Carola, ‘’Contemporary Sculpture: An Evolution in Volume and Space, A revised and Enlarged Edition’’, Faber and Faber, London, 1961, p. X&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a few other artists in the late 19th century who experimented with new artistic visions in sculpture like [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Paul Gauguin]], Rodin invented a radical new approach in the creation of sculpture. Modern sculpture, along with all modern art, "arose as part of Western society's attempt to come to terms with the urban, industrial and secular society that emerged during the nineteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Robert, ‘’ARTSPOKE: A Guide to Modern Ideas, Movements and Buzzwords, 1848-1944’’ Abbeville Publishers, New York, 1993, p.140&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism|Modernist]] [[sculpture]] movements include [[Art Nouveau]], [[Cubist sculpture|Cubism]], [[Geometric abstraction]], [[De Stijl]], [[Suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Pop-Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Land art]], [[Conceptual art]], and [[Installation art]] among others.

The modern sculpture movement can be said to begin at the [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] exhibit at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exhibition]] held in [[Paris, France|Paris]] in 1900. At this event Rodin showed his [[Burghers of Calais]], [[Balzac]], [[Victor Hugo]] statues, and the exhibition included the first public showing of his [[Gates of Hell]] which included [[The Thinker]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Penelope, ‘’Sculpture: 1900-1945’’, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, Albert L., ‘’Rodin’s Gates of Hell’’, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, MN, 1960 p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cubist sculpture]], in the early 20th century, was a style that developed in parallel with [[Cubism|cubist painting]], and the formal experiments of [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. Beginning around 1909 and evolving through the early 1920s cubist artists developed new means of constructing works of art using [[collage]], sculptural assemblage using disparate materials and traditional sculpture making from plaster and clay molds. Some sources name Picasso's 1909 bronze ''Head of a Woman'' as the first cubist sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/arts/art-view-picasso-revolutionized-sculpture-too.html Picasso Revolutionized Sculpture Too]", ''New York Times'', exhibition review 1982, Retrieved July 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and [[Alexander Archipenko]], who'd arrived in Paris in 1908 and whose 1912 ''Walking Woman'' were very quick to follow Braque and Picasso's lead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kodnergallery.com/gallery/modernism/bios/archipenkobio.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Csaky]], a sculptor from Hungary, exhibited his first cubist sculptures in Paris in 1911. [[Duchamp-Villon]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henri Laurens]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] and others joined the earlier cubist sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Cubism", ''Readings in Art History 2'' (1976), Seuphor, Sculpture of this Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edith Balas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;q=csaky#v=onepage&amp;q=csaky&amp;f=false Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture]'', American Philosophical Society, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, during his period of cubist innovation, [[Pablo Picasso]] revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his ''constructions'' fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; Picasso reinvented the art of sculpture with his innovative use of constructing a work in three dimensions with disparate material, the sculptural equivalent of the [[collage]] in two-dimensional art. Just as collage was a radical development in two-dimensional art; so was ''construction'' a radical development in three-dimensional sculpture. The advent of [[Surrealism]] led to things occasionally being described as "sculpture" that would not have been so previously, such as "involuntary sculpture" in several senses, including [[coulage]]. In later years Picasso became a prolific [[pottery|potter]], leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of  [[ceramic art]], with figures such as [[George E. Ohr]] and subsequently [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Kenneth Price]], and [[Robert Arneson]]. [[Marcel Duchamp]] originated the use of the "[[found object]]" (French: ''objet trouvé'') or ''readymade'' with pieces such as [[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]] (1917).

Similarly, the work of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late 19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his ''[[Bird in Space]]'' series (1924). These elegantly refined forms became synonymous with 20th-century sculpture.&lt;ref name=edward&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Visual arts in the 20th century'', Edition illustrated, Publisher Harry N. Abrams, 1997, Original from the University of Michigan, {{ISBN|0-8109-3934-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8109-3934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Brâncuși won a lawsuit against the U.S. customs authorities who attempted to value his sculpture as raw metal. The suit led to legal changes permitting the importation of abstract art free of duty.&lt;ref&gt;"Constantin Brâncuși", ''Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition, 2008 http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Constantin_Brancusi.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Brâncuși's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as [[Gaston Lachaise]], [[Sir Jacob Epstein]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Ásmundur Sveinsson]], [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Pablo Serrano]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]]&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford dictionary of American art and artists, Author Ann Lee Morgan, Publisher Oxford University Press, 2007,Original from the University of Michigan,{{ISBN|0-19-512878-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-512878-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by [[Alexander Calder]], [[Len Lye]], [[Jean Tinguely]], and [[Frederick Kiesler]] who were pioneers of [[Kinetic art]].

==Post-1950s==
Since the 1950s [[Modernist]] trends in sculpture both abstract and figurative have dominated the public imagination and the popularity of Modernist sculpture had sidelined the traditional approach. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] was commissioned to make a [[maquette]] for a huge, {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}}-high [[public art|public sculpture]] to be built in [[Chicago]], known usually as the ''[[Chicago Picasso]]''. He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman, or a totally abstract shape. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.

In the late 1950s and the 1960s, abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Richard Lippold]], [[George Rickey]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.

By the 1960s [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Geometric abstraction]] and [[Minimalism]], which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features,  predominated. Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of [[Sir Anthony Caro]], as well as [[welded sculpture]] by a large variety of sculptors, the large scale work of [[John Angus Chamberlain|John Chamberlain]], and environmental installation scale works by [[Mark di Suvero]]. Other Minimalists and [[Postminimalist]]s include [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Giacomo Benevelli]], [[Arnaldo Pomodoro]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Christo]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Robert Smithson]], and others like [[John Safer]] who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line.&lt;ref&gt;National Air and Space Museum Receives "Ascent" Sculpture for display at Udvar-Hazy Center [http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroomreleaseDetail.cfm?releaseID=49]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by pop artists and modernist artists in stylized forms by artists such as: [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Arman]], [[Leonard Baskin]], [[Ernest Trova]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Paul Thek]], [[Manuel Neri]] and others became popular. In the 1980s several artists, among others, exploring figurative sculpture were [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]] in a classic articulated style and [[Fernando Botero]] bringing his painting's "oversized figures" into monumental sculptures. [[Ceramic art|Ceramic]] sculpture as practiced by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Stephen De Staebler]], [[Kenneth Price]], and others became an important idiom of modern sculpture in the 20th century.

===Contemporary movements===
[[Site-specific art|Site specific]] and [[environmental art]] works are represented by artists: [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[Walter De Maria]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/piece/?search=Museum%20Piece&amp;page=&amp;f=Title&amp;object=73.2034 Guggenheim museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104152454/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/piece/?search=Museum%20Piece&amp;page=&amp;f=Title&amp;object=73.2034 |date=2013-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diacenter.org/exhibitions/artistbio/84 Dia Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Rickey]], and [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]-led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. Artists created [[environmental sculpture]] on expansive sites in the "[[Land Arts of the American West|land art in the American West]]" group of projects. These [[land art]] or "earth art" environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[James Turrell]] ([[Roden Crater]]). [[Eva Hesse]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Jackie Winsor]], [[Keith Sonnier]], and [[Bruce Nauman]], among others were pioneers of [[Postminimalist]] sculpture.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], [[Chryssa]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Edward Kienholz]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Duane Hanson]], and [[John DeAndrea]] explored abstraction, imagery, and figuration through [[video art]], environment, light sculpture, and [[installation art]] in new ways.

[[Conceptual art]] is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Works include ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'', 1965, by [[Joseph Kosuth]], and ''[[An Oak Tree]]'', 1973, by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], and those of [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[James Turrell]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/craig-martin-an-oak-tree-l02262 Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postmodern art|Postmodern sculpture]] occupies a broader field of activities than Modernist sculpture. [[Rosalind Krauss]] identified sculpture in the expanded field, a series of oppositions around the work's relationship to its environment that describe the various sculpture-like activities that are postmodern sculpture, creating a theoretical explanation that could adequately fit the developments of [[Land art]], [[Minimalism|Minimalist sculpture]], and [[site-specific art]] into the category of "sculpture":

* Site-Construction: the intersection of landscape and architecture 
* Axiomatic Structures: the combination of architecture and not-architecture
* Marked sites: the combination of landscape and not-landscape
* Sculpture: intersection of not-landscape and not-architecture

====Contemporary genres====
Modern sculpture is often created outdoors, as in [[environmental art]] and [[environmental sculpture]], often in full view of spectators. [[Light sculpture]] and [[site-specific art]] also often make use of the environment. Site-specific [[work of art|artwork]] is intentionally created for a specific place. The term was first used in the mid-1970s by sculptors [[Patricia Johanson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Athena Tacha]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Frank, "Site Sculpture", ''Art News'', Oct. 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Site specific environmental art was described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Howett, ''New Directions in Environmental Art,'' Landscape Architecture, Jan. 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and [[art critic]] [[Lucy Lippard]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Lippard, ''Art Outdoors, In and Out of the Public Domain,'' Studio International, March–April 1977&lt;/ref&gt; [[Land art]], [[Earthworks (art)|Earthworks]], ([[Earth art]]) is an [[art movement]] that makes specific use of the real landscape to form works of sculpture that are located in and make use of [[nature]] generally in altered form. It is a form of sculpture created in nature, from nature, using materials found in nature like dirt, [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], logs, branches, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[water]], as well as man made materials like [[Chain-link fencing]], [[barbed wire]], [[rope]], [[rubber]], [[glass]], [[concrete]], [[metal]], [[asphalt]], and mineral [[pigments]]. [[Ice sculpture]] is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. [[Kinetic sculpture]]s are sculptures that are designed to move, which include [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]]. [[Snow sculpture]]s are usually carved out of a single block of snow about 6 to {{convert|15|ft|m}} on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall.

[[Sound sculpture]]s take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as [[aeolian harp]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. [[Art toys]] have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by [[Takashi Murakami]] and [[Kid Robot]], designed by [[Michael Lau]], or hand-made by [[Michael Leavitt (artist)|Michael Leavitt]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art Army by Michael Leavitt", '' hypediss.com'' [http://www.hypediss.com/art_army_by_michael_leavitt], December 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">The '''Médiathèque Musicale Mahler''' is a multimedia library with collections relating to music of the 19th and 20th centuries. The institution is located in an elegant private house near the [[Parc Monceau]] in Paris at 11 bis rue de Vézelay ([[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]]). It was founded in 1986 as the '''Bibliothèque Gustav Mahler''' by the French biographer of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], musicologist [[Henry-Louis de La Grange]] (born 1924) and music critic, composer, and administrator [[Maurice Fleuret]] (1932&amp;ndash;1990) in order to combine and make available to the public their extensive personal archives. The library's holdings have regularly been expanded and updated, and include original manuscript scores, letters, and other documents, and published scores, books, periodicals, press clippings, recordings (LPs, cassettes, and CDs), and other personal archives. The current president of the library, [[Pierre Bergé]] (born 1930), is a former director of the [[Théâtre de l'Athénée-Louis Jouvet]] and President of the [[Paris Opera]] (1988&amp;ndash;1994) and succeeded La Grange as president of the library in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Home  |publisher=Médiathèque Musicale Mahler website |url=http://www.mediathequemahler.org/en/ |accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Historique&gt;{{Cite web |title=Historique|publisher=Médiathèque Musicale Mahler website |url=http://www.mediathequemahler.org/collections/historique/historique.html |accessdate=27 September 2010|language=fr}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Babylonian oracle''' is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[myth]], written on [[clay tablet]]s dated to between 2340 and 2200 [[Anno Domini|BC]].

The [[myth]] was discovered on the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], catalogue of the [[Babylonia]]n section (CBS), tablet number 8322 from their excavations at the [[temple]] [[library]] at [[Nippur]]. This was translated by [[George Aaron Barton]] in 1918 and first published as "Sumerian religious texts" in ''[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]'', number two, entitled "'''An Old Babylonian [[Oracle]]'''". The tablet is {{convert|3.2|in|cm}} by {{convert|2.6|in|cm}} by {{convert|0.85|in|cm}} at its thickest point.&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian inscriptions, p. 52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barton suggests the text is difficult and enigmatic, he confesses the interpretation put forward is uncertain and with great reserve. He suggests that it describes an oracle given by a [[Oracle|seer]] for a priest called "Allu-Kal" who wished to rebuild dwellings or a [[temple]] of [[Cedrus|cedar]] wood. Barton suggests [[Enlil]] then appears and takes [[Enki]]'s [[axe]], presumably to chop cedars for the building he proceeds to guard. Allu-Kal then entreats the gods for protection of the [[dwelling]]s of cedar to which the gods exalt him in reply and he is called a "bearded prince," suggested as a hint that he may be deified as were [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], [[Gudea]] and [[Shulgi]].&lt;ref name="Barton1918"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Society2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Oriental Society|title=Journal of the American Oriental Society, p. 139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=db4OAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 May 2011|date=January 2010|publisher=General Books LLC|isbn=978-1-152-35514-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Passenger to Frankfurt: An Extravanganza''''' is a [[spy novel]] by [[Agatha Christie]] first published in the United Kingdom by the [[Collins Crime Club]] in September 1970&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Peers |author-link=Chris Peers |first2=Ralph |last2=Spurrier |first3=Jamie |last3=Sturgeon |editor-first1=Peter |editor-last1=Foord |editor-first2=Richard |editor-last2=Williams |title=Collins Crime Club – A checklist of First Editions |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Collins_Crime_Club.html?id=UtomAQAAIAAJ |publisher=Dragonby Press |edition=2nd |year=1987 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States by [[Dodd, Mead and Company]] later in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Cooper |author-link=John Cooper (author) |first2=B A |last2=Pyke |title=Detective Fiction – the collector's guide |edition=2nd |pages=82, 87 |publisher=Scholar Press |year=1994 |ISBN= 0-85967-991-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.insightbb.com/~jsmarcum/agatha68.htm |title=American Tribute to Agatha Christie: Twilight Years 1968-1976 |last=Marcus |first=J S |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK edition retailed at twenty-five [[shillings]].&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; In preparation for [[decimalisation]] on 15 February 1971, it was concurrently priced on the dustjacket at [[Pound sterling|£]]1.25. The US edition retailed at $5.95.&lt;ref name="US" /&gt;

It was published to mark Christie's eightieth birthday and, by counting up both UK and US short-story collections to reach the desired total, was also advertised as her eightieth book. It is the last of her spy novels. At the beginning of the book there is a quote by [[Jan Smuts]], ''"Leadership, besides being a great creative force, can be diabolical ..."''

Sir Stafford Nye, a middle-aged diplomat, steps into the world of spies, double agents, and secret groups to effect a change in international power centers. He meets a woman who has selected him to aid her at a crucial point, when a weather delay changes where her and his airplane flight lands before proceeding to England. There is much commentary on the changes in the world, especially college age youth in Europe, the United States, and South America, in the late 1960s.

The novel received mixed reviews at publication&lt;ref name=Iles1970 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson1970 /&gt; and in 1990.&lt;ref name=Barnard1990 /&gt; In 2017, it was assessed favorably in an essay about speculative spy thriller novels by women.&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt; It is one of only four Christie novels not to have received an adaptation of any kind, the others being ''[[Death Comes as the End]]'', ''[[Destination Unknown (novel)|Destination Unknown]]'' and ''[[Postern of Fate]]''.

==Plot summary==
Sir Stafford Nye's flight home from [[Malaysia|Malaya]] takes an unexpected twist, when a woman approaches him in the [[Frankfurt Airport]]. The woman claims that her life is in danger, and that she needs his help. Nye agrees to lend her his traveling cloak, passport, and boarding ticket. A colleague in London, Horsham of Security, tells Nye that his action in Frankfurt saved Mary Ann’s life; Sir Stafford heard another name announced for her at the airport, Daphne Theodofanous. Nye has dinner with his friend Eric, worried for his professional reputation. Mary Ann returns his passport, taped into a magazine in his post. Nye advertises in the personals section of the newspaper for his mystery woman, signing himself as Passenger to Frankfurt. She replies with tickets to an opera, given at a discreet meeting on a bridge. His great-aunt Matilda hints to him of a terrible world-wide [[conspiracy]], which uses a [[Phrase (music)|phrase]] of music from [[Richard Wagner]], related to the opera ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'' (1876). Matilda detects that he has a woman in his life now.

The opera is ''Siegfried'', part of ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|The Ring of the Nibelung]]'' by Wagner. The mystery woman attends only the second half, leaving Nye the tune for young Siegfried marked on a copy of the program, a motif for what she is doing. He attends an embassy party, given by the American ambassador and his wife, Sam and Mildred Cortman. Mary Ann is there, under her real name, Countess Renata Zerkowski. She offers Nye a ride home, but takes him instead to the home of Mr Robinson the financier, where they meet Colonel Pikeaway, Lord Altamount, James Kleek and Horsham. Nye is not seen for a while, as he has been accepted by the close-knit group of British intelligence to aid in accomplishing the tasks Mary Ann has taken on. They travel extensively. Mary Ann warns Nye that one among their own group is probably a traitor.

Some believe that near the end of [[World War II]], [[Adolf Hitler]] went to a mental institution, met with a group of people who thought they were Hitler, and exchanged places with one of them, thus surviving the war. He escaped to [[Argentina]], where he married and had a son who was branded with a [[swastika]] on his heel. This belief encourages those who want to resurrect the beliefs and ways of the Nazis. The Countess believes she has this boy with his swastika tattoo. The story is told to the Intelligence group by psychiatrist Dr Reichardt, but they know it is false. Hitler had no son. The  British Intelligence group explains in several long expository chapters how drugs, promiscuity, and student unrest in the United States and Europe are caused by Nazi agitators. The agitators begin to bring about anarchy, attacking the American ambassador and the French Marshall. The goal is to re-build [[fascism]]. Meetings in Paris and London describe the movement of money and arms and their sources, and major players.

Nye's aunt, Lady Matilda, goes on her own trip, to visit her school mate, Countess Charlotte von Waldsausen, learning Charlotte's plans to be leader of the fascist world, which she then relates to her nephew. On her return, Matilda tells her friend Admiral Philip Blunt about the scientist Professor Shoreham, who invented something called Project B, or Benvo, which is a drug that makes people altruistic, but may cause a long-term change. Shoreham had a stroke, and he cannot communicate well. He had shelved Project B before his stroke. The Intelligence group meets at Shoreham’s home, where he explains the limitations of his benevolent project. Kleek, traitor in the Intelligence group tries to kill Lord Altamount by poison and is blocked, so Miss Ellis the nurse to Shoreham shoots Lord Altamount, who dies of shock. Miss Ellis is recognized as Milly Jean Cortman, who had also killed her husband. The violent incident brings new energy to Shoreham, who resolves to restart work on his project. He will contact his colleague Gottlieb to re-start Project Benvo and also arrange a memorial to Lord Altamount, the only politician he had ever trusted.

The final chapter is an epilogue, with Nye at Matilda's house preparing for his upcoming marriage to Mary Ann. The supposed son of Hitler has been brought to England for a more normal life and is about to become the organist at their church. Sybil, Nye's 5-year-old niece, will be the flower girl at the wedding. Nye forgot a best man, but asks Sybil to bring the panda, which he bought for her at the Frankfurt airport, in it from the beginning.

==Literary significance and reception==
Francis Iles ([[Anthony Berkeley Cox]]) in ''[[The Guardian]]'' (15 October 1970) said, "Of all the idiotic conventions attaching to the thriller the silliest is the idea that a car whizzing round a corner at high speed can be aimed at an intended victim who has, quite unseen, stepped off the pavement into the roadway at exactly the right moment. Agatha Christie uses this twice in ''Passenger to Frankfurt''. For the rest the book is largely a discursus on a favourite old theme of Mrs Christie's, the present state of the world and its future outlook, on both of which she takes a somewhat dim view. In other words, for her eightieth book a rather more serious work than usual from this author."&lt;ref name=Iles1970&gt;{{cite news |last=Iles |first=Francis |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 October 1970 |page=8 |title=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maurice Richardson in ''[[The Observer]]'' (13 September 1970) began, "Her eightieth book and [al]though not her best very far from her worst." He concluded: "At moments one wonders whether the old dear knows the difference between a [[hippie]] and a [[skinhead]] but she is still marvellously entertaining. I shall expect her to turn permissive for her eighty-firster."&lt;ref name=Richardson1970&gt;{{cite news |last=Richardson |first=Maurice |newspaper=The Observer |date=13 September 1970 |page=28 |title=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Barnard]] said of this spy novel that it was "The last of the thrillers, and one that slides from the unlikely to the inconceivable and finally lands up in incomprehensible muddle. Prizes should be offered to readers who can explain the ending. Concerns the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|youth uproar of the 'sixties]], drugs, a new Aryan superman and so on, subjects of which Christie's grasp was, to say the least, uncertain (she seems to have the oddest idea of what the term '[[Third World]]' means, for example). Collins insisted she subtitle the book 'An Extravaganza.' One can think of other descriptions."&lt;ref name=Barnard1990&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnard |first=Robert |title=A Talent to Deceive – an appreciation of Agatha Christie |edition=Revised |page=202 |publisher=Fontana Books |year=1990 |isbn=0-00-637474-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

Phyllis Lassner compares ''Passenger to Frankfurt'' with the [[Cold War]] novels of [[John le Carré]], and with the novel ''The Salzburg Connection'' (1968) by [[Helen MacInnes]]. These novels reassess the victory of the [[Allies of World War II]], and question the stability of [[post-war]] peace. The novels dramatise their era's anxieties about the re-emergence of [[Fascism]] during the Cold War. Lassner views both ''Passenger to Frankfurt'' and ''The Salzburg Connection'' as "speculative political fantasies".&lt;ref name="Lassner"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lassner |first1=Phyllis |editor1-last=Hanson |editor1-first=Clare |editor2-last=Watkins |editor2-first=Susan | title=''The History of British Women's Writing, 1945-1975: Volume Nine'' |chapter= Double Trouble: Helen MacInnes's and Agatha Christie's Speculative Spy Thrillers| year=2017 |pages=227-240| publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]| isbn=978-1137477361| url =https://books.google.gr/books?id=y9o1DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=%22Passenger+to+Frankfurt%22+Christie&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8uqmxsp7dAhXGESwKHSt5DwoQ6AEIOjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Passenger%20to%20Frankfurt%22%20Christie&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both Christie and MacInnes employed [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] typical for [[spy fiction]]: "masculine leadership", [[double agent]]s, and thrilling chases and getaways. However, both female writers revised the typical [[gender role]]s of the spy fiction genre. The female characters of the two novels play an important role in investigating and intervening in international crises. While spy fiction writers typically reduce the female characters to [[sidekick]]s or romantic distractions for their protagonists.&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt;

Concerning Christie, Lassner notes that this was far from her first spy novel. Early in her career, Christie wrote a series of spy thrillers, such as ''[[The Secret Adversary]]'' (1922), ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'' (1924), ''[[The Big Four (novel)|The Big Four]]'' (1927), and ''[[The Seven Dials Mystery]]'' (1929).&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt; However, ''Passenger to Frankfurt'' differs from other Christie novels, because it is not another example of [[detective fiction]] or [[crime fiction]]. It is a combination of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] and [[Utopian and dystopian fiction| dystopian fiction]], exploring a hypothetical future for the entire world. The novel depicts a resurgence of [[Nazism]], which depends on uniting the young people of the world under its creed. The new Nazi movement and its agents seduce the world's youth with promises of [[Glory (honor)|glory]] and [[hero]]ism. The indoctrinated youth are manipulated into overthrowing the governments of their respective nations, and redeploying the national resources into supporting a new regime. The actual goal of the [[conspiracy]] is to establish a global [[oligarchy]], controlled by a self-appointed [[master race]].&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt;

Lassner also notes Christie's view on Nazism in general. The [[Fourth Reich]] of the novel is depicted as relying on a culture of [[drug user]]s, [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadism]], [[lust]] for power, and [[hatred]]. The potential rise of this Reich to power is depicted as a downfall for the ideals of [[Individual]]ity and [[democracy]], along with the associated social and political order.&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt; Aunt Matilda serves as the proverbial "fount of wisdom" of the novel, when observing that the Reich is not based on new ideas, but on an old, and recurring one. That everybody must follow "the young hero", the "golden [[Übermensch|superman]]", "the young [[Sigurd|Siegfried]]".&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt; Nye dismisses his aunt's warnings about Nazism as mere fancies. But Matilda notes that people said the same thing in the [[interwar period]] about [[Adolf Hitler]] and about the [[Hitler Youth]]. But at that time, Nazism was planning its rise to power through planting [[fifth column]]s in different countries. People passionately believing in the Nazi creed. Matilda argues that the same methods could work again in the Cold War era, if the Nazi message is "offered cleverly enough".&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt;

Christie does not locate the dangers of the novel's era only to the 1960s "brigades of revolutionary youth". Christie uses the novel to criticize the [[apathy]] of an older generation, while the youth of the era causes [[riot]]s around the world. The recruitment drive for a new [[Children's Crusade]], is (according to Christie) the result of the failure of the post-war generations (the parents and grandparents of the rioting youth) to create a better or more progressive political order. The older generations of the novel essentially cling to an "archaic political order" , that offers no real progressive ideas.&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt; Lassner feels that it is not a coincidence that the novel opens with Stafford Nye dozing off at the [[Frankfurt Airport]]. It reflects Nye's casual indifference towards the political changes in the world surrounding him.&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt;

The late 1960s quest of Countess Renata and Nye to stop the "fascist crusade", causes them to travel from the United Kingdom to an 18th-century [[Schloss]], which the text places in proximity to [[Berchtesgaden]]. Berchtesgaden is described as "Hitler's mountain lair". The Schloss of the novel serves as the headquarters of [[Graf|Gräfin]] Charlotte von Waldsausen, the place from where she devises strategies for [[world domination]] and trying to convert individuals into an obedient mass. The novel notes that Charlotte's original family name was "Krapp". Christie intended the name as a pun, connecting the villain of the novel with the [[Krupp]] family of industrialists, which was essential for Hitler's war machine.&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt; The Gräfin is depicted as explicitly supporting [[the Holocaust]], when she fondly recalls deaths in [[gas chamber]]s and torture cells. Her personal wealth, essential for financing her schemes, is described in the novel as deriving from the exploitation of the world's natural resources. She reportedly earned this wealth through exploitation and control over oil, copper, goldmines in [[South Africa]], armaments in [[Sweden]], uranium deposits, nuclear developments, and "vast stretches" of cobalt.&lt;ref name="Lassner" /&gt;

'''''Phoenix Rising''''' is a 1994 book by [[Karen Hesse]].  It is a [[Realism (arts)|realistic fiction]] book about a 13-year-old girl named Nyle and her grandmother, and how their lives are disrupted by a [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]]. Everyone that lives anywhere near the accident suddenly has to wear masks, test everywhere for high levels of [[radiation]], and watch everything they eat and drink to make sure it's not contaminated until the government gives the all clear. Nyle and her grandmother live together on a farm in [[Vermont]], near the nuclear plant in Cookshire. She and her grandmother take in two evacuees from the accident. The boy, 15-year-old Ezra Trent, absorbed a large amount of radiation and is very sick, yet there is no room in any of the hospitals for him. His father had died less than a week ago at the time Nyle and her grandmother take them in, due to radiation poisoning. Nyle is terrified to let herself care about him because she believes that if she lets herself care for him, she will end up losing him, just like her mother and grandfather. He and his mother, Miriam Trent, end up staying in the back bedroom, which Nyle calls 'the dying room' because that is where her mother and grandfather had died when they were sick. She pushes Ezra away, but they eventually end up growing closer as he gets better.

The '''Pioneer plaques''' are a pair of [[gold]]-[[anodized]] [[aluminium]] [[commemorative plaque|plaques]] which were placed on board the 1972 ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and 1973 ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' [[spacecraft]], featuring a [[pictogram|pictorial message]], in case either ''Pioneer 10'' or ''11'' is intercepted by [[extraterrestrial life]].

Pages available online: [http://www.enterprisemission.com/images/plaque-1.jpg 1], [http://www.enterprisemission.com/images/plaque-2.jpg 2], [http://www.enterprisemission.com/images/plaque-3.jpg 3], [http://www.enterprisemission.com/images/plaque-4.jpg 4].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pioneer 10'' and ''11'' spacecraft were the first human-built [[List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System|objects to achieve escape velocity]] from the [[Solar System]]. The plaques were attached to the spacecraft's [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] support [[strut]]s in a position that would shield them from erosion by [[space dust|interstellar dust]].

==History==
The original idea, that the Pioneer spacecraft should carry a message from mankind, was first mentioned by [[Eric Burgess]]&lt;ref name="pournelle198204"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-04/1982_04_BYTE_07-04_Human_Factors_Engineering#page/n213/mode/2up | title=The Osborne 1, Zeke's New Friends, and Spelling Revisited | work=BYTE | date=April 1982 | accessdate=October 19, 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he visited the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Pasadena, California]], during the [[Mariner 9]] mission. He approached [[Carl Sagan]], who had lectured about communication with intelligent extraterrestrials at a conference in [[Crimea]].

Sagan was enthusiastic about the idea of sending a message with the Pioneer spacecraft. [[NASA]] agreed to the plan and gave him three weeks to prepare a message. Together with [[Frank Drake]] he designed the plaque, and the artwork was prepared by [[Linda Salzman Sagan]], who was Sagan's wife at the time.

Both plaques were manufactured at Precision Engravers, [[San Carlos, California]].

The first plaque was launched with ''Pioneer 10'' on March 2, 1972, and the second followed with ''Pioneer 11'' on April 5, 1973.

In May 2017 a limited edition of 200 replicas engraved from the original master design at Precision Engravers was made available in a [[Kickstarter]] Campaign, which also offered laser-engraved replicas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Duane|title=Pioneer Plaque: a Message from Earth|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/duaneking/pioneer-plaque-a-message-from-earth|website=Kickstarter.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

===Hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque hydrogen.svg|thumb|Hyperfine transition of neutral [[hydrogen]]]]
At the top left of the plate is a schematic representation of the [[hyperfine transition]] of [[hydrogen]], which is the [[abundance of the chemical elements|most abundant element]] in the [[universe]]. The [[Hydrogen_line|spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom’s electron]] has a [[frequency]] of about 1420.405&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|MHz]], which corresponds to a [[Frequency#Period_versus_frequency|period]] of 0.704&amp;nbsp;[[Nanosecond|ns]]. Light at this frequency has a vacuum [[wavelength]] of 21.106&amp;nbsp;[[Centimetre|cm]] (which is also the distance the light travels in that time period). Below the symbol, the small vertical line&amp;mdash;representing the [[binary numeral system|binary]] digit 1&amp;mdash;specifies a unit of length (21&amp;nbsp;cm) as well as a unit of time (0.7&amp;nbsp;ns). Both units are used as measurements in the other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Jake|title=The Pioneer Plaque: Science as a Universal Language|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2016/0120-the-pioneer-plaque-science-as-a-universal-language.html|website=The Planetary Society|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Figures of a man and a woman===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque humans.svg|thumb|Figures of a [[man]] and a [[woman]]]]
On the right side of the plaque, a man and a woman are shown in front of the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/10/aliens-modern-messages-earths-equality-diversity-seti-yuri-milner|title=Send aliens modern messages of Earth's equality and diversity, say scientists|date=10 September 2015|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the brackets that indicate the height of the woman, the binary representation of the number 8 can be seen (1000, with a small defect in the first zero). In units of the wavelength of the hyperfine transition of hydrogen this means 8 × 21&amp;nbsp;cm = 168&amp;nbsp;cm.

The right hand of the man is raised as a sign of good will. Although this gesture may not be understood, it offers a way to show the [[opposable thumb]] and how the [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] can be moved.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

Originally Sagan intended the humans to be shown holding hands, but soon realized that an extraterrestrial might perceive them as a single creature rather than two organisms.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

The original drawings of the figures were based on drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and Greek sculptures.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

The woman's [[sex organ|genitals]] are not depicted in detail; only the ''[[Mons pubis]]'' is shown. It has been claimed that Sagan, having little time to complete the plaque, suspected that NASA would have rejected a more intricate drawing and therefore made a compromise just to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)|Alan Fletcher]], ''"The art of looking sideways"'', Phaidon Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7148-3449-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Sagan said that the decision to not include the vertical line on the woman's genitalia ([[pudendal cleft]]) which would be caused by the intersection of the [[labia majora]] was due to two reasons. First, Greek sculptures of women do not include that line. Second, Carl Sagan believed that a design with such an explicit depiction of a woman's genitalia would be considered too obscene to be approved by NASA.&lt;ref name="Cosmic"&gt;Sagan, C. (2009).&lt;!--The PDF version was created in 2009.--&gt; &lt;u&gt;Carl Sagan, Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective, Cambridge University Press&lt;/u&gt; pp. 22-25 {{ISBN|0-521-78303-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the memoirs of [[Robert S. Kraemer]], however, the original design that was presented to NASA headquarters included a line which indicated the woman's [[vulva]],&lt;!-- This is at the top of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt; and this line was erased as a condition for approval of the design by John Naugle, former head of NASA's Office of Space Science and the agency's former chief scientist.&lt;!-- This is at the top of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt;{{clear}}

===Relative position of the Sun to the center of the Galaxy and 14 pulsars===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque sun.svg|thumb|Relative position of the [[Sun]] to the center of the [[Galaxy]] and 14 [[pulsar]]s with their periods denoted]]
The radial pattern on the left of the plaque shows 15 lines emanating from the same [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Fourteen of the lines have corresponding long binary numbers, which stand for the [[Frequency|periods]] of [[pulsar]]s, using the hydrogen spin-flip transition frequency as the unit. Since these periods will change over time, the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] of the launch can be calculated from these values.

The lengths of the lines show the relative distances of the pulsars to the [[Sun]]. A tick mark at the end of each line gives the Z coordinate perpendicular to the [[galactic plane]].

If the plaque is found, only some of the pulsars may be visible from the location of its discovery. Showing the location with as many as 14 pulsars provides redundancy so that the location of the origin can be [[triangulation|triangulated]] even if only some of the pulsars are recognized.

The data for one of the pulsars is misleading. When the plaque was designed, the frequency of pulsar "1240" (now known as J1243-6423) was known to only three significant decimal digits: 0.388 second.&lt;ref name=Sagan1972 /&gt; The map lists the period of this pulsar in binary to much greater precision: 100000110110010110001001111000. Rounding this off at about 10 significant bits (100000110100000000000000000000) would have provided a hint of this uncertainty. This pulsar is represented by the long line pointing down and to the right.

The fifteenth line on the plaque extends to the far right, behind the human figures. This line indicates the Sun's relative distance to the center of the galaxy.

The pulsar map and hydrogen atom diagram are shared in common with the [[Voyager Golden Record]].
{{clear}}

===Solar System===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque solar system.svg|thumb|The [[Solar System]] with the trajectory of the Pioneer spacecraft]]
At the bottom of the plaque is a schematic [[diagram]] of the Solar System. A small picture of the spacecraft is shown, and the [[trajectory]] shows its way past [[Jupiter]] and out of the Solar System. Both ''Pioneers 10'' and ''11'' have identical plaques; however, after launch, Pioneer 11 was redirected toward [[Saturn]] and from there it exited the Solar System. In this regard the ''Pioneer 11'' plaque is somewhat inaccurate.
The Saturn flyby of ''Pioneer 11'' would also greatly influence its future direction and destination as compared to ''Pioneer 10'', but this fact is not depicted in the plaques.

Saturn's rings could give a further hint to identifying the Solar System. [[Planetary ring|Rings]] around the planets Jupiter, [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]] were unknown when the plaque was designed; however, unlike Saturn, the ring systems on these planets are not so easily visible and apparent as Saturn's. [[Pluto]] was considered to be a planet when the plaque was designed; in 2006 the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] reclassified Pluto as a [[dwarf planet]] and then in 2008 as a [[plutoid]]. Other large bodies classed as dwarf planets, such as [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], are not depicted, as they were unknown at the time the plaque was made.

The binary numbers above and below the [[planet]]s show the relative distance to the Sun. The unit is 1/10 of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit. Rather than the familiar "1" and "0", "I" and "-" are used.

===Silhouette of the spacecraft===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque spacecraft.svg|thumb|Silhouette of the Pioneer spacecraft relative to the size of the humans]]
Behind the figures of the human beings, the [[silhouette]] of the Pioneer spacecraft is shown in the same [[scale (spatial)|scale]] so that the size of the human beings can be deduced by measuring the spacecraft.

== Criticism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Voyager Golden Record]] --&gt;

One of the parts of the diagram that is among the easiest for humans to understand may be among the hardest for the extraterrestrial finders to understand: the [[Arrow_(symbol)|arrow]] showing the trajectory of Pioneer. An article in ''[[Scientific American]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Gombrich]] ‘The Visual Image’, 1972 in Scientific American (eds {{clarify|date=August 2013}}) ''Communication''. San Francisco, California, Freeman, pp. 46–60; originally in a special issue of Scientific American, September 1972; republished in Gombrich (1982) ''The Image and the Eye: Further Studies in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation'', London, Phaidon, pp. 137–61.&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the use of an arrow because arrows are an artifact of hunter-gatherer societies like those on Earth; finders with a different cultural heritage may find the arrow symbol meaningless.

Art critic and activist [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] said that sexual bias is exhibited by the choice to make the man in the diagram perform the [[Wave (gesture)|wave]] gesture to greet the extraterrestrials while the woman in the diagram has her hands at her sides.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 176. Bogue (1991) is being used as a secondary source for this criticism from Owens (1983).--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogue, R. (1991). &lt;u&gt;Mimesis in Contemporary Theory: (vol. 2) Mimesis, semiosis, and power&lt;/u&gt;. USA: John Benjamins Publishing Company. pp. 176. {{ISBN|1-55619-150-2}} (hb.) (v. 2 : US)&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists also took issue with this choice for the same reason.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 92.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Achenbach"&gt;Achenbach, J. (1999). &lt;u&gt;Captured by Aliens: The Search for Life and Truth in a Very Large Universe&lt;/u&gt; New York, NY: Citadel Press Books. pp. 92. {{ISBN|0-8065-2496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Sagan regretted that the figures in the finished engraving failed to look panracial. Although this was the intent, the final figures appeared Caucasian.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 92.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Achenbach" /&gt; In the original drawing, the man was drawn with an "Afro" haircut, so an additional African physical trait would be included in the man to make the figures look more panracial, but that detail was changed to a "non-African Mediterranean-curly haircut" in the finished engraving.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 297.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gepper, A.C.T. (2012). &lt;u&gt;Imagining Outer Space: European Astroculture in the Twentieth Century&lt;/u&gt;. New York, NY: Smithsonian Institution. pp. 297. {{ISBN|978-0-230-23172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Carl Sagan said that Linda Sagan intended to portray both the man and woman as having brown hair, but the hair being only outlined rather than being both outlined and shaded made the hair appear blonde instead.&lt;!--This is at the top of page 74.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spangenburg, R. &amp; Moser, K. (2004). &lt;u&gt;Carl Sagan: A Biography&lt;/u&gt; USA: Greenwood Press. pp. 74. {{ISBN|0-313-32265-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people had different interpretations of the race of people depicted by the figures. Whites, blacks and Asians each tended to think that the figures resembled their own racial group, so, although some people were proud that their race appeared to have been selected to represent all of humankind, others viewed the figures as "terribly racist" for "the apparently blatant exclusion" of other races.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 82.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt;

Linda Sagan decided to make the figures nude to address the problem of the type of clothes they should wear to represent all of humanity and to make the figures more anatomically educational for extraterrestrials,&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 79.--&gt; but their nudity was viewed as pornographic by the American media.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton"&gt;Wolverton, M. (2004). &lt;u&gt;The Depths of Space: The Story of the Pioneer Planetary Probes&lt;/u&gt; Joseph Henry Press. pp. 79, 80 &amp; 82. {{ISBN|0-309-53323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to astronomer Frank Drake, there were many negative reactions to the plaque because the human beings were displayed naked.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Carl Sagan]], ''Murmurs of Earth'', 1978, New York, {{ISBN|0-679-74444-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When images of the final design were published in American newspapers, one newspaper published the image with the man's genitalia removed and another newspaper published the image with both the man's genitalia and the woman's nipples removed.&lt;!--This is in the second and third paragraphs of page 23.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt; In one letter to a newspaper, a person angrily wrote that they felt that the nudity of the images made the images obscene.&lt;!--This is in the first paragraph of page 24.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt; In contrast, in another letter to the same newspaper, a person was critical of the [[Prude|prudishness]] of the people who found depictions of nudity to be obscene.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 24. The writer is being sarcastic in second and third paragraphs of page 24. Using sarcasm, the writer is mocking the prudishness which led to the censorship of the woman's vulva rather than supporting the censorship.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

{{ref-improve|section|date=May 2017}}
;Star Trek
*In the ''Star Trek Encyclopedia'' paperback – International Edition, October 1, 1999, the plaque is shown with Pioneer launching from the second planet rather than the third. 
* In the science fiction film ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', the plaque's diagram is fleetingly shown during Spock's mindmeld with V'ger, a transformed [[NASA]] space probe, ''Voyager 6''. This style of plaque was not used in the two actual NASA probes in the [[Voyager program]].
*In ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the plaque appears on the viewing screen when a signal is sent by Rain Robinson trying to communicate with ''Voyager''. 16 minutes and 28 seconds into episode 8 season 3 Future's End.
* In the science fiction film ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', the plaque is shown attached to a Pioneer probe floating in space—just before the probe is intercepted and destroyed by a bored [[Klingon]] ship captain, who scoffs "Shooting space garbage is no test of a warrior's mettle." However the plaque is erroneously depicted as facing outwards rather than inwards.
* In the ''Star Trek'' novel ''Federation'', a character mentions that humans had shown copies of the plaque to several alien races they encountered, but none had been able to decode it.

;Other
* In "[[The Message (The Outer Limits)|The Message]]," an episode of the science fiction series ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', a deaf woman was featured receiving alien signals through her [[cochlear implant]], prompting her to write out Xs, 1s, and 0s on paper. When put together, the Xs turned into the images of the man and woman from the plaque, along with an extraterrestrial humanoid raising a hand in a peaceful gesture.
* On her album ''[[United States Live]]'', American performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]] contemplates extraterrestrials finding the plaque and asks "do you think that they will think his arm is permanently attached in this position?"
* In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Godfellas]]," the robot Bender finds himself doomed to drift through space, during which time he etches a modified version of the Pioneer plaque, with himself towering menacingly over the human figures, so that "When I'm found in a million years, people will know what the score was."
* In ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' season 1, episode 15 "Ardala Returns," Princess Ardala constructs a fake probe (allegedly launched in 1996) that utilizes a copy of the plaque in order to trick Buck into thinking the probe was from his own time period — the distant past.
* In the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] novel ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'', it is mentioned by the principal alien character that his race's conquest of Earth was made possible by their discovery of a space probe "that gave full directions to the place, had pictures of man on it and everything".
* In "[[Beware My Cheating Bart]]" (18th episode of Season 23) of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the plaque was briefly shown at the end of the episode. It was depicted with an extraterrestrial holding the plaque upside down, obviously confused by its strange depictions.
* The plaque is used as the artwork for the album ''Aufheben'' by [[the Brian Jonestown Massacre]] and for ''Accept the Signal'' by [[Regular Fries]].
* A drawing which bears a strong likeness to the one depicted in the plaque was used as the artwork for [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[avant-garde metal]] band [[Arcturus (band)|Arcturus]]' album ''[[Sideshow Symphonies]]''.
* A character in ''[[Kamen Rider Gaim]]'' uses a package containing language dictionaries and a modified version of the plaque to later communicate with an other-dimensional sentient race.
* In the TV show ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', on episode 5 of season 2 (Duck Duck Goose), the plaque is shown as part of the debris that lands on Earth.
* In the TV show ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', on episode 21 of season 8 (The Communication Deterioration), the plaque is mentioned when they are discussing ideas about sending a message to alien races in space.
* In the video game by [[Paradox Development Studio]], ''[[Stellaris (video game)|Stellaris]]'', one of the scientific missions discovers the plaque on an alien world in the distant future.
* The Pioneer plaque appears in the booklet of [[David Bowie]]'s 2016 album ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'', on the page for the song "[[Girl Loves Me]]".
* The Pioneer plaque appears in 01 - Welcome / Orientation briefing video of the Mass Effect Andromeda Initiative website. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.masseffect.com/andromeda-initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[17776]] has ''Pioneer 10'' (named Ten in the story) as a sentient being who is made fun of by ''[[Pioneer 9]]'' (Nine) and ''[[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]]'' (JUICE) for being sent into space with a plaque displaying naked humans.
* In the [[Wii U]] title, ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]'', the plaque is seen in the opening cut scene, damaged and floating in midspace, before one of the alien ships that later approaches Earth.
* [[Edwin_Morgan_(poet)|Edwin Morgan]]'s poem, "Translunar Space March 1972", refers to Pioneer 10, and passes critical commentary on the images on the plaque: "A deodorized American man / with apologetic genitals and no pubic hair / holds up a banana-like right hand"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collected Poems |authors=Edwin Morgan |year=1997 |publisher=Carcanet Press |location=Manchester |isbn=978-1-857541-88-5 |pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Power Rangers Wild Force''''' is an American television series and the tenth season and anniversary of the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise, based on the [[Super Sentai]] series ''[[Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger]]'', which itself was the 25th anniversary of Super Sentai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/11/12/power-rangers-seasons-8-12-dvd-review|title=Power Rangers: Seasons 8-12 DVD Review - IGN|website=Uk.ign.com|date=2013-11-11|accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Power Rangers Wild Force'' takes place in 2002. The first part of the series was originally broadcast from February to August 2002 on the [[Fox Kids]] television block. Following the sale of Fox Family Worldwide (renamed [[ABC Family Worldwide]]) including [[Saban Entertainment]] (renamed [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television|BVS Entertainment]]) to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] by [[Haim Saban]] and [[News Corporation]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network's]] parent company, the show was moved in the fall 2002 to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s new Saturday morning block, [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] (formerly [[ABC Kids (United States)|Disney's One Saturday Morning]]).

==Plot summary==
{{main|List of Power Rangers Wild Force characters|List of Power Rangers Wild Force episodes}}

The series follows the adventure of [[Cole Evans]], who had been staying with a [[tribe]] in a [[jungle]] for many years, as he tries to find his destiny in the fictitious town of Turtle Cove.  He encounters the Animarium, a place that many believed to be a fairy tale.  He joins four others who had a common path to become the new leader of the ''[[Wild Force Power Rangers]]''.

The Animarium is an island that floats in the sky. It is shaped like a [[turtle]] and is the home of the Wild Zords and Princess Shayla, the Rangers' mentor. 

The Power Rangers use their powers to defeat the forces of the Orgs, led by one [[Master Org]].  As Cole was fond of other animals, he was shocked to discover that the Orgs were literally heartless horned monsters. As the series continues, he finds out the truth about his real parents: his parents, Richard and Elizabeth Evans, were professors at Turtle Cove University, along with a family friend, Dr Viktor Adler who was secretly in love with Elizabeth. When they were sent to the jungle for research, they discover the remains of Master Org, in which a jealous Adler consumes in order to exact revenge on Richard, who had proposed to Elizabeth before he could.  However, Adler goes insane, and kills both Richard and Elizabeth. For a while, their newborn son, Cole, was also presumed dead.

In addition to the annual team-up episodes, ''Power Rangers Wild Force'' also had a special episode commemorating it as the tenth incarnation, ''Forever Red'', by having Cole team up with the nine Red Rangers before him, (in order of incarnations, [[Jason Lee Scott]], [[Aquitian Rangers#Aurico|Aurico]], [[Tommy Oliver]], [[Power Rangers Turbo #Characters|T.J. Johnson]], [[Power Rangers in Space#Characters|Andros]], [[List of Power Rangers Lost Galaxy characters #Galaxy Power Rangers|Leo Corbett]], [[List of Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue characters #Carter Grayson|Carter Grayson]], [[List of Power Rangers Time Force characters #Wesley "Wes" Collins|Wesley "Wes" Collins]] and [[List of Power Rangers Time Force characters #Eric Myers|Eric Myers]]), in order to prevent the remaining generals of the Machine Empire from unearthing and reactivating Lord Zedd's zord, Serpentera, which had been left buried on the moon.

==Production==

''Wild Force'' was the first season to be under the copyright of Disney Enterprises. Disney had bought Power Rangers (along with other Saban properties) at the end of ''[[Power Rangers Time Force]]''. It was the last season to be produced in the United States by MMPR Productions as pre-production for Wild Force began before the buyout as well as they still had a contract for [[Fox Kids]]. Disney's acquisition resulted in Wild Force having to be finished far sooner than expected as Disney would cut the budget for the show completely. The season's promotional photo was merely a photo of the main cast standing together on set in-between shots as there was no money to do it professionally.

When this programming block expired, the series moved to [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] in September 2002. [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] would rerun encore presentations while the show premiered both on Fox Kids and on ABC Kids in 2002. Following this season, production of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise moved from [[Los Angeles]], California to [[New Zealand]] which resulted in many crew members and all voice actors being laid off.

'''Publicly funded elections''' are designed to reduce corruption by funding elections with federal tax revenue or income tax donations as opposed to corporate campaign contributions or individuals with disproportionate wealth. The purpose is to remove undue monetary influence on politicians.  It is an attempt to move toward one person one vote in a democracy.

== In the United States ==
Methods of publicly funded election legislation have been adopted in [[Maine]], [[Connecticut]], [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], [[Maryland]], [[Michigan]], [[Arizona]], [[North Carolina]], [[New Mexico]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Massachusetts]].  In addition, public funding of elections have been incorporated at the municipal level in several cities.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Wisconsin's 33 year old program was defunded by the state legislature in 2011 by Gov. [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] and the legislature's joint finance committee.  California recently overturned its ban on publicly funded elections, but charter cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles were already exempt from the ban and already have some form of public financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Bill | last = Lueders | title = Campaign financing dead in Wisconsin | date = 2011-06-30 | publisher = [[Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism]] | url = http://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2011/06/30/campaign-financing-dead-in-wisconsin/ | work = WisconsinWatch.org | accessdate = 2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these laws have run into constitutional problems in the courts.  When the [[Citizens United v. FEC]] decision defined money as a form of speech, the ability to limit campaign spending and publicly finance campaigns in cities and states came into question.  Some portions (such as state supplemental funds for publicly financed candidates whose opponents outspend them) of the Vermont system were found newly unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Randall v. Sorrell]].'', but the core program of full funding of governor and lieutenant governor candidates remains in place. Portions of Connecticut's statute were held unconstitutional in 2009, on the grounds that it unfairly discriminated against third party and independent candidates, but the core program of full funding of constitutional and legislative candidates remains in place.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125147352119767009 |work = Wall Street Journal|subscription =yes|title = Connecticut Campaign Finance Law Ruled Unconstitutional|date = 28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld portions of the District court's order but allowed the core program to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Green Party of Connecticut v. Garfield |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=13 July 2010 |url= http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/green-party-1.pdf|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2011, ruling in the consolidated cases ''[[Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett]]'' and ''[[McComish v. Bennett]]'', the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional the matching-funds provision of the Arizona law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.politico.com/story/2011/06/narrow-ruling-on-campaign-finance-057851 |title=Narrow ruling on campaign finance |publisher=Politico |date=2011-06-27 |accessdate= |last= Vogel|first = Kenneth P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision cast doubt on the new constitutionality of similar provisions in Maine, Wisconsin, and elsewhere. As a result, the Wisconsin legislature eliminated funding for its judicial elections in 2011.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Additionally, voters have not supported publicly funded elections in several referendums. In Massachusetts the system was repealed after a 2002 advisory initiative in which voters voted nearly 2 to 1 against using government funds to pay for political campaigns. [[Portland, Oregon]]'s program was narrowly repealed by voters in a 2010 referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.portlandoregon.gov/auditor/article/329306|title = November 2010 General Election - Official Results|publisher = The City of Portland Oregon }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a Clean Elections bill, the California Fair Elections Act (AB583) passed the California Assembly and Senate and was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger.  Because of the ban on publicly funded elections, the law had to be approved by voters in an initiative in June 2010. On June 8, 2010, California voters defeated the measure by 57% to 43%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/09/california-election-resul_n_605467.html#slide_image |title=Huffington Post |publisher=Huffington Post |date= 2010-06-09|accessdate=2011-01-05 |first=Craig |last=Kanalley}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier Clean Elections ballot initiative, [[Proposition 89]] was also defeated in California in 2006, by 74% against to 26% in favor of a corporate tax to fund elections. A Clean Elections ballot initiative in Alaska failed by a 64% to 35% margin in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/election/story/506632.html |work=Anchorage Daily News |title = 2008 Primary Election Results |date=21 October 2008 |accessdate=2011-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102221321/http://www.adn.com/election/story/506632.html |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, North Carolina repealed its popular "Voter Owned Elections" program of public financing of judicial campaigns with 900 people arrested at the Moral Monday protests in Raleigh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicampaign.org/blog/2013/07/26/north-carolina-legislature-repeals-popular-judicial-public-financing-program|work=Public Campaign|title = North Carolina Legislature Repeals Popular "Voter Owned Elections" Program|last = Smith|first = Adam|date=2013-07-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131009221257/http://www.publicampaign.org/blog/2013/07/26/north-carolina-legislature-repeals-popular-judicial-public-financing-program |archivedate=2013-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive public funding systems have been in effect in [[Arizona]] and [[Maine]] since 2000. In [[Maine]], since enactment, approximately three quarters of state legislators have run their campaigns with government funds provided by the state program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/ethics/mcea/index.htm |title=Maine Ethics Commission: Maine Clean Election Act (MCEA) |publisher=Maine.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arizona]], a majority of the state house{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and both the Republican and Democratic candidates for [[Governor]] ran publicly financed campaigns in 2006. There has not yet been a statewide election in Maine in which both the Republican and Democratic candidates were financed through the public financing system.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

== In Other Countries ==
The United Kingdom, Norway, India, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria, Sweden are some jurisdictions where methods of publicly funded election legislation and the reasons for the need of alternatives to privately funded campaigns have been considered. http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/24/world/global-campaign-finance/index.html

=="Clean Elections": Differences from traditional reforms==
"Clean Elections" is the name supporters have given to some public financing efforts, used most prominently in Maine and Arizona.

Some Clean Elections laws provide a government grant to candidates who agree to limit their spending and private fundraising.  Candidates participating in a Clean Elections system are required to meet certain qualification criteria, which usually includes collecting a number of signatures and small contributions (generally determined by statute and set at $5 in both Maine and Arizona) before the candidate can receive public support.  In most Clean Elections programs, these qualifying contributions must be given by constituents. To receive the government campaign grant, "Clean Candidates" must agree to forgo all other fundraising and accept no other private or personal funds. Candidates who choose not to participate are subject to limits on their fundraising, typically in the form of limits on the size of contributions they may accept and the sources of those contributions (such as limits on corporate or union contributions), and detailed reporting requirements.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the US, in order to comply with ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'', participation by candidates is not legally required. Originally, many Clean Elections programs provided that publicly financed candidates who were outspent by a privately funded candidate could receive additional funds (sometimes called "rescue funds") to match their privately funded opponent, up to a cap, with the intent of assuring that a candidate running with private funding would not outspend his government funded opponent. However, in [[Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett]], the U.S. Supreme Court held that such "rescue fund" provisions unconstitutionally burdened the rights of speakers by intentionally limiting the effectiveness of their own speech. Thus since Bennett clean elections systems in the U.S. have been forced to abandon the "rescue funds" approach.

==US supporters==
In the US, SB 752, the Fair Elections Now Act, calling for publicly funded elections in [[U.S. Senate]] campaigns, was sponsored in the 111th Congress (2009–10) by Senators: [[Dick Durbin]] (D-IL) and [[Arlen Specter]] (D-PA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-752 |title=S. 752: Fair Elections Now Act |publisher=GovTrack.us |date= |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A companion bill, H.R. 1826, was introduced in the House, sponsored by [[John Larson]] (D-CT), [[Chellie Pingree]] (D-ME), and Walter Jones (R-NC).  Unlike the Clean Elections laws in Maine and Arizona, H.R. 1826 did not include the "rescue funds" provision, perhaps due to concern about constitutionality in the wake of the Davis decision. Neither bill moved out of Committee.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

* [[Elizabeth Warren]] Massachusetts senator a leading figure of the democratic party
*[[Gavin Newsom]] Lt. Governor of California
* [[Barack Obama]] as an Illinois senator was the first co-sponsor of the 2007 version of the Durbin–Specter bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090413/nyhart_donnelly |title=April 13, 2009 |publisher=The Nation |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Obama chose not to participate in the public financing system in [[Fundraising for the 2008 United States presidential election|2008]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2464">The '''Ramayana Centre''' is cultural and spiritual organization based in [[Port Louis]], Mauritius. It was founded in 2001 by an act passed in the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|National Assembly]] of the Republic of [[Mauritius]] to promote and propagate the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the spiritual, social and cultural values flowing therefrom.&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The Bill was unanimously approved on May 22, 2001 and was proclaimed as an Act by the President of the Republic on June 14, 2001. It was published in the ''Government Gazette'' No. 64 on June 30, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Ramayana Centre Act 2001

The president of the Ramayana Centre is Pandit Rajendra Arun, scholar of the Ramayana and author of several books on various characters of the Ramayana. In 2002, on  Tulsi Jayanti day, the foundation stone of the Ramayana Center laid by Prime Minister, Anerood Jugnauth. &lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite web | title = Ramayana Center in Mauritius |work=[[Hinduism Today]] Magazine

{{nihongo|'''''Rolling Thunder 2'''''|ローリングサンダー2|Rōringu Sandā Tsū}} is a [[Run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] [[arcade game]] developed and released by [[Namco]] for the [[Namco System 2]] hardware in 1990. The game is the sequel to 1986's ''[[Rolling Thunder (video game)|Rolling Thunder]]'', retaining the same gameplay of its predecessor but adding [[cooperative gameplay]] for two players and improved graphics. Unlike the original, which was based in 1968, ''Rolling Thunder 2'' features a more contemporary setting to go along with its more futuristic design, as well as an optionally playable female character. A port for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] was released in 1991. Both the Mega Drive port and the original arcade game were released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] on December 4, 2007 and October 27, 2009 respectively.

==Arcade game==
Set in the 1990s, the Geldra organization, thought to had been destroyed during the first game, returns and is destroying several of the world's satellites in outer space. As in the original ''[[Rolling Thunder (video game)|Rolling Thunder]]'', the players must take control of a member of the WCPO's Rolling Thunder task force.

Two players can now play simultaneously, with Player 1 as female agent Leila and Player 2 as male agent Albatross. Even though they possess different external appearances, including different handguns, the two characters have identical abilities (much like Yūichirō Tomari and Sunday Chin from Namco's own ''[[Ordyne]]'', which was released two years earlier and is also a [[Namco System 2]] game). As with the original game, both Leila and Albatross can only take two physical hits from the enemies - and a hit from a bullet or other projectile such as a laser will result in an immediate death for them. Both of them are armed with a default pistol that has only limited ammo; when bullets run out, their guns shall fire a slow "chaser" bullet instead. The players can also upgrade to a semi-automatic machine gun, by entering marked doors - and when entering one of these marked doors, a counter shall appear, which indicates the number of remaining bullets left to be picked up (allowing one player to leave ammo for the other).

The graphics are noticeably improved over the previous game and have a decidedly more futuristic look to go along with the game's modern setting; the game's main enemy characters, the Maskers, who were previously designed to look like hooded terrorists (or Foot Soldiers of the original ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' arcade game) are now cyborgs. Likewise, the game has more varied stage designs, with the first four stages taking place in a seaside resort in Florida, and the last four stages in a pyramid in Egypt - both locations are actually camouflaged Geldra bases.

==Home version==
[[Image:Rolling Thunder 2 (USA).PNG|thumb|left|upright|Packaging for the Genesis version.]]

The Mega Drive/Genesis port differs from the arcade original by its inclusion of [[cut scene]]s before each stage, consisting of a single static images displayed above a scrolling text that narrates the story's progression; there are also three additional stages not present in the original arcade version, that take place between the arcade's original stages. These stages stand out from their arcade counterparts due to the presence of different upgradeable weapons and end-stage bosses. The Genesis version also features hidden power-ups in unmarked doors such as time extensions, energy recovery, and extra lives.

Much like in the NES port of the original game, a [[password (video games)|password]] feature has which uses full sentences instead of numerals and a harder difficulty level after completing the normal game. Both the original ''Rolling Thunder 2'' arcade game and Genesis conversion are available on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] service (and the Genesis conversion was again released on there first).

==Reception==
The home version of ''Rolling Thunder 2'' was well received. Its mostly highly positive review scores included 92% from ''[[Computer &amp; Video Games]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-video-games-magazine-122/CVG122_Jan_1992#page/n15/mode/2up |title=Computer and Video Games Magazine Issue 122 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 23/25 from ''[[GamePro]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''GamePro'' 29 (December 1991), pages 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; 85% from ''[[Mean Machines]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/review/247/rolling-thunder-2.php |title=Rolling Thunder 2 - Sega Megadrive - Mean Machines review |publisher=Meanmachinesmag.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 90% from ''[[MegaTech]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outofprintarchive.com/articles/reviews/MegaDrive/RollingThunder2-MegaTech2-1.html |title=Out-of-Print Archive • Mega Drive reviews • Rolling Thunder 2 |publisher=Outofprintarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, retrospectively, 8/10 from Sega-16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2004/07/rolling-thunder-2/ |title=Sega-16 – Rolling Thunder 2 |publisher=Sega-16.com |date=2004-07-26 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of the Virtual Console release were often more critical, including being rated 6/10 by [[GameSpot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shau |first=Austin |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rolling-thunder-2-review/1900-6184778/ |title=Rolling Thunder 2 Review |publisher=GameSpot |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2015-11-12 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 6.5/10 by [[IGN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2008/01/15/rolling-thunder-2-review |title=Rolling Thunder 2 Review - IGN |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 8/10 by Nintendo Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2007/12/rolling_thunder_2_virtual_console |title=Rolling Thunder 2 (MD) Review |publisher=Nintendo Life |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rowland Gibson Hazard by Jean Paul Selinger 1880.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Rowland G. Hazard in portrait of 1880]]
'''Rowland Gibson Hazard''' (October 9, 1801 – June 24, 1888) was an American industrialist, politician, and [[social reform]]er.

==Early life==
Hazard was born in [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]] in 1801. His parents were Rowland Hazard (sometimes referred to as Rowland Hazard I&lt;ref name=PDNR&gt;[http://www.peacedale.net/historyhistoricsites.html Peace Dale History and Historic Sites], Peace Dale Neighborhood Revitalization, Inc., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;), founder in 1802 of the Peace Dale Manufacturing Company in [[Peace Dale, Rhode Island]], and the former Mary Peace. He grew up in [[Bristol, Pennsylvania]], in the home of his maternal grandfather, Isaac Peace. He was educated in a [[Quaker]] [[boarding school]] in [[Burlington, New Jersey]], where he developed a particular interest in mathematics.&lt;ref name=urilibraryexhibit/&gt;&lt;ref name=RGandCarolinepapers&gt;[http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss483sg05.htm Rowland G. and Caroline (Newbold) Hazard Papers], Rhode Island Historical Society, Manuscripts Division&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HazardFamily1896&gt;{{cite book |author=Caroline Elizabeth Robinson |title=The Hazard family of Rhode Island, 1635-1894 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ips-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA166 122–123] |year=1896 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819 he returned to [[Rhode Island]] to join his elder brother Isaac in the management of the Peace Dale Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref name=urilibraryexhibit&gt;[http://www.uri.edu/library/special_collections/exhibits/hazard/Rowland%20G%20Hazard.html Rowland Gibson Hazard, Rhode Island Manufacturer, Politician, and Philosopher], University of Rhode Island Library, Special Collections and University Archives, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PeaceDalePapers&gt;[http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss483sg36.htm Peace Dale Manufacturing Company Records], Rhode Island Historical Society, Manuscripts Division&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1828 he married Caroline Newbold of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]]. The couple had two sons, Rowland II and John.&lt;ref name=urilibraryexhibit/&gt;&lt;ref name=HazardFamily1896/&gt;

==Peace Dale textile mills==
A third brother, Joseph P. Hazard, became a partner in the Peace Dale operation in 1828, and the business took the name "R.G. Hazard &amp; Co." One of Rowland Hazard's responsibilities was selling the company's products to [[Planter (American South)|planter]]s in the southern United States, particularly [[Louisiana]], [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]]. He spent winters in New Orleans from about 1833 to 1842 to sell goods that included cotton [[bag]]ging cloth, pre-cut garments, low-priced shoes, and raw "[[Negro cloth]]" for use by African-American slaves.&lt;ref name=RGandCarolinepapers/&gt;

After an 1845 fire destroyed one of the mill buildings,&lt;ref name=PeaceDalePapers/&gt; the brothers built new facilities, including expanded [[hydropower]] systems and a fireproof stone factory.&lt;ref name=PDNR/&gt;

In 1848 the partnership incorporated, becoming the Peace Dale Manufacturing Company, with Isaac P. Hazard as president and Rowland Hazard as secretary/treasurer.&lt;ref name=RGandCarolinepapers/&gt;&lt;ref name=PeaceDalePapers/&gt; In 1849 the business started a transition into making woolen shawls and other high-quality woolens instead of cheaper fabrics.&lt;ref name=PDNR/&gt;

==Carolina Mills Company==
In 1843, Hazard acquired a [[textile mill]] complex at the village now known as [[Carolina, Rhode Island]], and renamed the mill and its surrounding village in honor of his wife. The Carolina Mills Company remained in family ownership until 1863 and was operated by his son Rowland II until at least 1877.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss483sg23.htm Carolina Mills Records], Rhode Island Historical Society, Manuscripts Division&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity related to slavery==
The activity that Hazard considered "as the greatest effort of his life" (according to his granddaughter) began when he was in [[New Orleans]] on business in the winter of 1841. After he learned that a free African-American man from [[Newport, Rhode Island]] was in custody in [[Louisiana]] as an escaped [[slavery|slave]], his investigations found that many free African-Americans were being detained under the assumption they were escaped slaves. He worked with [[Jacob Barker]], then a New Orleans lawyer, to obtain freedom for nearly 100 people being held as slaves. The action later led to charges being filed against several public officials who were responsible for the illegal detentions.&lt;ref name=urilibraryexhibit/&gt;

His involvement with [[abolitionism|abolitionist causes]] and in the Republican Party eventually caused his company to lose favor with its markets in the southern United States.&lt;ref name=RGandCarolinepapers/&gt; This helped to prompt the Peace Dale mills' transition from making cheap cotton products to selling higher quality woolens.&lt;ref name=RGandCarolinepapers/&gt;&lt;ref name=PeaceDalePapers/&gt;

==Political career==
Hazard served three one-year terms in the [[Rhode Island House of Representatives]], winning election as a state representative in 1851, 1854 and 1880. He also was a [[Rhode Island Senate|state senator]] from 1866 to 1867. In 1856 he was one of Rhode Island's delegates to the [[1856 Republican National Convention|founding convention]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=RGandCarolinepapers/&gt; Four years later he was a delegate to the [[1860 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref name=PDNR/&gt;

In 1854, while serving in the state legislature, he made a speech criticizing the Stonington Railroad Company for charging discriminatory rates for both freight and passengers. Shortly thereafter, the railroad company retaliated by refusing to let Hazard ride on one of its trains. Resolutions passed by the South Kingstown Town Council in reaction to his treatment are said to have formed "the germ of" the [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887|Interstate Commerce Law of 1886]].&lt;ref name=HazardFamily1896/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
"As a public benefactor, Hazard contributed to the schools and churches in South Kingstown and endowed a professorship of physics at Brown University with a gift of $40,000." &lt;ref&gt;https://library.brown.edu/riamco/xml2pdffiles/US-RUn-msg9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
Hazard retired from the textile business in 1866 and invested in the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. After Union Pacific fell into financial disarray and became a party to the [[Crédit Mobilier scandal]] of 1872, Hazard spent much time dealing with the company's financial affairs.&lt;ref name=RGandCarolinepapers/&gt;

He died in Peace Dale on June 24, 1888.&lt;ref name=urilibraryexhibit/&gt;

==Writings==
Hazard was a prolific writer in the fields of philosophy, economics, and politics. Among his published works were:&lt;ref name=PDNR/&gt;&lt;ref name=urilibraryexhibit/&gt; 
*''Language'' or ''Essay on Language'' (1835)
*''Causes of Decline of Political Morality'' (1841)
*''Freedom of Mind in Willing'' (1866)
*''Causation and Freedom in Willing'' (1869)
*''The Duty of Individuals to Support Science and Literature'' (essay; 1885)

[[File:Sarajevo Haggadah.jpg|thumb|right|Copies of the Sarajevo Haggadah in the parliament building of Bosnia and Herzegovina.]]
The '''Sarajevo Haggadah''' is an [[illuminated manuscript]] that contains the [[Jewish ceremonial art|illustrated traditional text]] of the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]] which accompanies the [[Passover Seder]]. It is one of the oldest [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Haggadahs in the world, originating in [[Barcelona]] around 1350. The Haggadah is owned by the [[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in [[Sarajevo]]. Its monetary value is undetermined, but a museum in Spain required that it be insured for $7 million before it could be transported to an exhibition there in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://haggadah.ba/?x=1 |publisher=Haggadah.ba |title = The Sarajevo Haggadah |accessdate= 31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sarajevo Haggadah is handwritten on bleached calfskin and illuminated in copper and gold. It opens with 34 pages of illustrations of key scenes in the Bible from [[Creation myth|creation]] through the death of [[Moses]]. Its pages are stained with wine, evidence that it was used at many Passover Seders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Passover Relic|last=Reff|first=Zach|newspaper=San Diego Jewish Journal|url=http://www.sdjewishjournal.com/stories/apr06_4.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522034051/http://sdjewishjournal.com/stories/apr06_4.html|archivedate=22 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sarajevo Haggadah was submitted by Bosnia and Herzegovina for inclusion in UNESCO's [[Memory of the World]] Register and was included in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Sarajevo Haggadah manuscript | website=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization | url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-sarajevo-haggadah-manuscript/ | access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Sarejevohagadah.gif|thumb|left|An illustrated page from the Sarajevo Haggadah, written in fourteenth-century Spain. Top: [[Moses]] and the [[Burning Bush]]. Bottom: [[Aaron's staff]] swallows the magicians']]
The Sarajevo Haggadah has survived many close calls with destruction. Historians believe that it was taken out of Spain by Spanish Jews who were expelled by the [[Alhambra Decree]] in 1492. Notes in the margins of the Haggadah indicate that it surfaced in [[Italy]] in the 16th century. It was sold to the National Museum in Sarajevo in 1894 by a man named Joseph Kohen.&lt;ref name="exodus"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geraldinebrooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Korkut_near-final-pages.pdf|title= The Book of Exodus: A Double Rescue in Wartime Sarajevo|date=3 December 2007|last=Brooks|first=Geraldine|format=PDF| journal=The New Yorker|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the manuscript was hidden from the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[Ustashe]] by the Museum's chief librarian, Derviš Korkut, who at risk to his own life, smuggled the Haggadah out of Sarajevo. Korkut gave it to a Muslim cleric in [[Zenica]], where it was hidden under the floorboards of either a mosque or a Muslim home.  In 1957, a facsimile of the Haggadah was published by [[Sándor Scheiber]], director of the [[Budapest University of Jewish Studies|Rabbinical Seminary]] in [[Budapest]].  In 1992 during the [[Bosnian War]], the Haggadah manuscript survived a museum break-in and it was discovered on the floor during the police investigation by a local Inspector, Fahrudin Čebo, with many other items thieves believed were not valuable. It survived in an underground bank vault during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] by Serb forces. To quell rumors that the government had sold the Haggadah in order to buy weapons, the president of Bosnia presented the manuscript at a community Seder in 1995.

Afterwards, the manuscript was restored through a special campaign financed by the United Nations and the Bosnian Jewish community in 2001, and went on permanent display at the museum in December 2002.

In 1985 a reproduction was printed in Ljubljana, with 5,000 copies made. The National Museum subsequently authorized the publication of a limited number of reproductions of the Haggadah, each of which has become a [[collectable|collector's item]]. In May 2006, the Sarajevo publishing house Rabic Ltd., announced the forthcoming publication of 613 copies of the Haggadah on handmade parchment that attempts to recreate the original appearance of the 14th century original, alluding to the [[613 Mitzvot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://haggadah.ba/?x=4 |title=The Sarajevo Haggadah|work=haggadah.ba  |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a brief mention of the manuscript in the motion picture ''[[Welcome to Sarajevo]]''. The novel ''[[People of the Book (novel)|People of the Book]]'', by [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]] (2008), crafts a fictionalised history of the Haggadah from its origins in Spain to the museum in Sarajevo. The Winter, 2002, issue of the [[literary journal]] Brick published [[Ramona Koval]]'s account of the disputes surrounding the proposed [[UNESCO]]-funded display of the original [[codex]] in the context of the post-[[Dayton Agreement]] UN-supervised 1995 peace settlement.

The history of Derviš Korkut, who saved the book from the Nazis, was told in an article by Geraldine Brooks in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="exodus" /&gt; The article also sets out the story of the young Jewish girl, Mira Papo, whom Korkut and his wife hid from the Nazis as they were acting to save the Haggadah. In a twist of fate, as an elderly woman in Israel, Mira Papo secured the safety of Korkut's daughter during the Bosnian war in the 1990s.

A copy of the Sarajevo Haggadah was given to former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair by the Grand Mufti of Bosnia and Herzegovina Mustafa Ceric during the awards ceremony for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's Faith Shorts competition in December 2011. The Grand Mufti presented it as a symbol of interfaith cooperation and respect, while recounting the protection of the Jewish book by Muslims on two occasions in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/blog/entry/faith-shorts-2011-awards-ceremony1/ |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203203801/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/blog/entry/faith-shorts-2011-awards-ceremony1 |archivedate=3 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another copy was given by the Grand Mufti Ceric to a representative of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] during the interreligious meeting "''Living Together is the Future''" organised in Sarajevo by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avvenire.it/Chiesa/Pagine/haggadah-sarajevo-dono.aspx Dal muftì di Bosnia il dono dell'Haggadah al gran rabbinato di Israele], Avvenire&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the Haggadah's future exhibition was left in limbo following a drought in funding for the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which shuttered its doors after going bankrupt and not paying its employees for almost a year. In 2013 the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]] attempted to arrange for a loan of the Haggadah, but due to internal political battles within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the loan was eventually refused by Bosnia’s National Monuments Preservation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ben Zion|first1=Ilan|title=Hostage to politics, glorious Sarajevo Haggadah languishes in crumbling museum|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/hostage-to-politics-glorious-sarajevo-haggadah-languishes-in-crumbling-museum/|date=7 October 2014|website=The Times of Israel|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Haggadah was again on display as of September 2015, following the National Museum's re-opening. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294450-d644593-Reviews-National_Museum_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina-Sarajevo_Sarajevo_Canton.html#REVIEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social metabolism''' or '''socioeconomic metabolism''' is the set of [[Stock and flow|flow]]s of [[material]]s and [[energy]] that occur between [[Nature]] and [[society]], between different societies, and within societies. These human-controlled material and energy flows are a basic feature of all societies but their magnitude and diversity largely depend on specific [[culture|cultures]], or sociometabolic regimes.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Manuel |first1= |last2= Toledo |first2= Víctor M. |year= 2014|title= The Social Metabolism: A Socio-Ecological Theory of Historical Change|url= https://books.google.es/books/about/The_Social_Metabolism.html?id=JwzvAwAAQBAJ| publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-319-06357-7 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"&gt;{{es}}[http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/rz/v34n136/v34n136a4.pdf El metabolismo social: una nueva teoría socioecológica.] Relaciones. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Social or socioeconomic metabolism is also described as "the self-reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society. It comprises those biophysical transformation processes, distribution processes, and flows, which are controlled by humans for their purposes. The biophysical structures of society (‘in use stocks’) and socioeconomic metabolism together form the biophysical basis of society."
&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social metabolic processes begin with the [[human]] ''appropriation'' of materials and energy from nature. These can be ''transformed'' and ''circulated'' to be ''consumed'' and ''excreted'' finally back to Nature itself. Each of these processes has a different [[environmental impact]] depending on how it is performed, the amount of materials and energy involved in the process, the area where it occurs, the time available or the Nature's regenerative capacity.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"/&gt;

Social metabolism represents an extension of the metabolism concept from human bodies to the biophysical basis of society. Humans build and operate mines and farms, oil refineries and power stations, factories and infrastructure to supply the energy and material flows needed for the physical reproduction of a specific culture. In-use stocks, which comprise buildings, vehicles, appliances, infrastructure, etc., are built up and maintained by the different industrial processes that are part of social metabolism. These stocks then provide service to people in form of shelter, transportation, or communication.

Society and its metabolism together form an [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] system, a complex system that reproduces itself. Neither culture nor social metabolism can reproduce themselves in isolation. Humans need food and shelter, which is delivered by social metabolism, and the latter needs humans to operate it.

Studies of social metabolism can be carried out at different levels of system aggregation, see [[material flow analysis]]. In material flow accounting, for example, the [[Factor of production|inputs]] and [[Output (economics)|outputs]] of materials and energy of a particular [[State (polity)|state]] or region, as well as [[import]]s and [[export]]s, are analysed. Such studies are facilitated by the ease of access to information about [[commercial transaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 2000|title= The Weight of Nations: Material Outflows from Industrial Economies |url= http://pdf.wri.org/weight_of_nations.pdf |publisher= World Resources Institute |isbn=978-1-56973-439-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carpintero Redondo |first= Óscar |year= 2005|title= El metabolismo de la economía española: recursos naturales y huella ecológica (1955-2000) |url= http://www.fcmanrique.org/recursos/publicacion/elmetabolismo.pdf|language= Spanish|publisher= Fundación César Manrique |isbn=978-84-88550-60-6 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Social or socioeconomic metabolism stipulates that human society and its interaction with Nature form a complex  self-reproducing system, and it can therefore be seen as [[paradigm]] for studying the biophysical basis of human societies under the aspect of self-reproduction. "A common paradigm can facilitate model combination and integration, which can lead to more robust and comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments of sustainable development strategies. ... The use of social or socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm can help to justify alternative economic concepts."&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uzbekistan anthem.ogg|thumb|With words]]
The '''State Anthem of the Republic of Uzbekistan'''&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-uz|Oʻzbekiston Respublikasining Davlat Madhiyasi}}, &lt;/ref&gt; came into being when [[Uzbekistan]] was a [[republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. Upon [[independence]] in 1991, lacking any other suitable candidate, the tune of the [[Anthem of Uzbek SSR|old Uzbek SSR anthem]], composed by [[Mutal Burhanov]], was retained with new lyrics written by [[Abdulla Oripov (poet)|Abdulla Oripov]]. This is broadcast when Uzbek radio and television stations [[Sign-on and sign-off|sign on]] at 5:55 a.m.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A7gYFJjWVC4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the anthem's music is played in [[G major]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Lyrics of the Anthem==
The modern anthem only has two verses and two choruses, while the Uzbek SSR Anthem had three of each, arranged in a similar structure.

'''Stuckism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ʌ|k|ɪ|z|əm}}) is an international [[art movement]] founded in 1999 by [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] to promote [[Figurative art|figurative painting]] as opposed to [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/s/stuckism "Glossary: Stuckism"], ''[[Tate]]''.

Childish and Thomson have issued several manifestos. The first one was ''The Stuckists'', consisting of 20 points starting with "Stuckism is a quest for [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]".&lt;ref name=stuckistmanifest&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/stuckistmanifesto.html The Stuckists manifesto], stuckism.com.

After exhibiting in small galleries in [[Shoreditch]], London, the Stuckists' first show in a major public museum was held in 2004 at the [[Walker Art Gallery]], as part of the [[Liverpool Biennial]]. The group has demonstrated annually at [[Tate Britain]] against the [[Turner Prize]] since 2000, sometimes dressed in clown costumes. They have also come out in opposition to the [[Charles Saatchi]]-patronised [[Young British Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/movements/stuckism Stuckism], Artist Biographies website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8834871/The-Turner-Prizes-most-controversial-moments.html The Turner Prize's most controversial moments], 20 October 2011, The Telegraph website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although painting is the dominant artistic form of Stuckism, artists using other media such as photography, sculpture, film and [[collage]] have also joined, and share the Stuckist opposition to conceptualism and "ego-art."&lt;ref name=robertjanas&gt;"Stuckism International: The Stuckist Decade 1999–2009", [[Robert Janás]], [http://www.victoriapress.co.uk/ Victoria Press], 2009, a: p.73 - b: p.64, {{ISBN|0-907165-28-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Stuckism" was coined in January 1999 by [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] in response to a poem read to him several times by [[Billy Childish]]. In it, Childish recites that his former girlfriend, [[Tracey Emin]] had said he was "stuck! stuck! stuck!" with his art, poetry and music.&lt;ref name=milner7&gt;[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Thomson, Charles]] (August 2004), "A Stuckist on Stuckism: Stella Vine", from: Ed.

There were eleven other founding members: [[Philip Absolon]], Frances Castle, Sheila Clark, [[Eamon Everall]], [[Ella Guru]], [[Wolf Howard]], [[Bill Lewis]], Sanchia Lewis, [[Joe Machine]], [[Sexton Ming]], and [[Charles Williams (artist)|Charles Williams]].&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; The membership has evolved since its founding through creative collaborations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/info.html "Stuckism: Introduction"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 18 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the group was originally promoted as working in paint, but members have since worked in various other media, including poetry, fiction, performance, photography, film and music.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt;

In 1979, Thomson, Childish, Bill Lewis and Ming were members of [[The Medway Poets]] performance group, to which Absolon and Sanchia Lewis had earlier contributed.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Peter Waite's Rochester Pottery staged a series of solo painting shows.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; In 1982, [[Television South|TVS]] broadcast a documentary on the poets.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; That year, Emin, then a fashion student, and Childish started a relationship; her writing was edited by Bill Lewis, printed by Thomson and published by Childish.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Group members published dozens of works.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; The poetry group dispersed after two years, reconvening in 1987 to record ''The Medway Poets'' LP.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Clark, Howard and Machine became involved over the following years.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Thomson got to know Williams, who was a local art student and whose girlfriend was a friend of Emin; Thomson also met Everall.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; During the foundation of the group, Ming brought in his girlfriend, Guru, who in turn invited Castle.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt;

==Manifestos==
[[Image:2000 Real Turner Prize Show.jpg|thumb|left|The first Stuckists group of 13 artists at the ''Real Turner Prize Show'', Pure Gallery, Shoreditch, London, in October 2000]]

In August 1999, Childish and Thomson wrote ''The Stuckists [[manifesto]]''&lt;ref name=stuckistmanifest/&gt; which stress the value of painting as a medium, its use for communication, and the expression of emotion and experience – as opposed to what Stuckists see as the superficial novelty, nihilism and irony of conceptual art and [[postmodernism]]. The most contentious statement in the manifesto is: "Artists who don't paint aren't artists".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/stuckists-scourge-of-britart-put-on-their-own-exhibition-413009.html Stuckists, scourge of BritArt, put on their own exhibition] Sarah Cassidy, ''[[The Independent]]'', 23 August 2006,&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and third manifestos, ''An Open Letter to Sir Nicholas Serota'' and ''[[Remodernism]]'' respectively, were sent to the director of the [[Tate]], [[Nicholas Serota]]. He sent a brief reply: "Thank you for your open letter dated 6&amp;nbsp;March. You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto 'Remodernism'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/serotareply.html "An open letter to Sir Nicholas Serota"], stuckism.com, 1999. Retrieved 20 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Remodernism'' manifesto, the Stuckists declared that they aimed to replace postmodernism with remodernism, a period of renewed spiritual (as opposed to religious) values in art, culture and society. Other manifestos have included ''Handy Hints'', ''Anti-anti-art'', ''The Cappuccino writer and the Idiocy of Contemporary Writing'', ''The Turner Prize'', ''The Decreptitude of the Critic'' and ''Stuckist critique of Damien Hirst''.

In ''Anti-anti-art'', the Stuckists outlined their opposition to what is known as "[[anti-art]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/StuckistAntiAntiArt.html |title=Anti-Anti-Art |publisher=Stuckism.com |date=2000-11-04 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stuckists claim that [[conceptual art]] is justified by the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], but that Duchamp's work is "anti-art by intent and effect". The Stuckists feel that "Duchamp's work was a protest against the stale, unthinking artistic establishment of his day", while "the great (but wholly unintentional) irony of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]] is that it is a direct equivalent of the conformist, unoriginal establishment that Duchamp attacked in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/art2/asullivan/stuckism.html |title=Stuckism : Art Against Art Against Art |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manifestos have been written by other Stuckists, including the Students for Stuckism group. An "Underage Stuckists" group was founded in 2006 with a manifesto for teenagers written by two 16-year-olds, Liv Soul and Rebekah Maybury, on [[MySpace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Manifestos/UnderageStuckists.html "The Underage Stuckists Manifesto"], stuckism.com.

In July 1999, the Stuckists were first mentioned in the media, in an article in ''The Evening Standard'' and soon gained other coverage, helped by press interest in Tracey Emin, who had been nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/news99.html Stuckism news 1999], stuckism.com.

The first Stuckist show was ''Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!'' in September 1999 in Joe Crompton's in [[Shoreditch]] Gallery 108 (now defunct), followed by  ''The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota''. In 2000 they staged ''The Real Turner Prize Show'' at the same time as the [[Tate Gallery]]'s Turner Prize exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-891549-turner-prize-a-load-of-rubbish.do Turner Prize: a load of rubbish?], ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 24 October 2000.

A "Students for Stuckism" group was founded in 2000 by students from [[Camberwell College of Arts]], who staged their own exhibition. [[Stephen Howarth|S.P.

From 2002 to 2005 Thomson ran the [[Stuckism International Gallery|Stuckism International Centre and Gallery]] in Shoreditch, London. In 2003, under the title ''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', the gallery exhibited a shark which had first been put on public display in 1989 (two years before [[Damien Hirst]]'s) by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch shop, JD Electrical Supplies. It was suggested that Hirst may have seen this and copied it.&lt;ref name=deadshark&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/SharkSpot.html "A Dead Shark Isn't Art"], stuckism.com.

In 2003 they reported [[Charles Saatchi]] to the UK [[Office of Fair Trading]], complaining that he had an effective monopoly on art.

==Responses &amp; Critique==
In 1999, two performance artists, [[Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi]], jumped on Tracey Emin's installation ''My Bed'', a work consisting of the artist's own unmade bed, at the Tate Gallery's Turner Prize, in an unauthorised [[art intervention]]. Chai had written, among other things, the words "Anti Stuckism" on his bare back. Fiachra Gibbons of ''The Guardian'' wrote (in 1999) that the event "will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement."&lt;ref name=satirists&gt;Gibbons, Fiachra (1999)[https://www.theguardian.com/turner1999/Story/0,12119,201733,00.html "Satirists Jump into Tracey's Bed"]''[[The Guardian]]'' online, 25 October 1999. Retrieved 22 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''The Guardian'' ten years later, Jonathan Jones described the Stuckists as "enemies of art", and what they say as "cheap slogans" and "hysterical rants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=The Stuckists are enemies of art |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/oct/01/art-stuckist-manifesto |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=16 March 2015|date=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist Max Podstolski wrote that the art world needed a new manifesto, as confrontational as that of [[Futurism]] or [[Dadaism]], "written with a heart-felt passion capable of inspiring and rallying art world outsiders, dissenters, rebels, the neglected and disaffected", and suggests that "Well now we've got it, in the form of Stuckism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Podstolski |first1=Max |title=Head vs. Heart: a Critique of the Stuckist Manifesto |url=http://www.spark-online.com/issue32/podstolski.html |journal=Spark-online |issue=32.0 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328082935/http://www.spark-online.com/issue32/podstolski.html |archivedate=28 March 2013 |date=May 2002 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York art gallery owner Edward Winkleman wrote in 2006 that he had never heard of the Stuckists, so he "looked them up on Wikipedia", and stated he was "turned off by their anti-conceptual stance, not to mention the inanity of their statement about painting, but I'm more than a bit interested in the democratization their movement represents." Thomson responded to Winkleman directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Winkleman |first1=Edward |title=The Stuckists |url=http://www.edwardwinkleman.com/2006/08/stuckists.html |accessdate=16 March 2015 |date=28 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Winkleman is notable in this context, read above for why--&gt;

Also in 2006, Colin Gleadell, writing in ''[[Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', noted that the Stuckist's first exhibition in central London had brought "multiple sales" for leading artists of the movement, and that this raised the question of how good they were at painting. He observed that "Whatever the critics may say, buyers from the UK, the US and Japan have already taken a punt. Six of Thomson's paintings have sold for between £4,000 and £5,000 each. Joe Machine, a former [[jailbird]] who paints for therapeutic reasons, has also sold six paintings for the same price."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gleadell|first1=Colin|title=Market news: Roger Hilton's child-like drawings, 'stuckist' paintings and Edward Seago|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3655699/Market-news-Roger-Hiltons-child-like-drawings-stuckist-paintings-and-Edward-Seago.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC arts correspondent Lawrence Pollard wrote in 2009 that the way was paved for "cultural agitators" like the Stuckists, as well as the [[Vorticism|Vorticists]], [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] and others, by the Futurist Manifesto of 20 February 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Back to the Futurists |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7894877.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 March 2015 |date=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sápmi''' ({{IPA-xx|ˈsapmi|[[Northern Sami language|Northern Sami:]]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/974612447|title=North Sámi : an essential grammar|last=Riitta-Liisa,|first=Valijärvi,|others=Kahn, Lily,|isbn=9781138839373|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=974612447}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[cultural area|cultural region]] traditionally inhabited by the [[Sami people]] (previously known as Lapps in English, which is a derogatory term). Sápmi is located in Northern Europe and includes the northern parts of [[Fennoscandia]]. The region stretches over four countries: [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Russia]]. On the north it is bounded by the [[Barents Sea]], on the west by the [[Norwegian Sea]] and on the east by the [[White Sea]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;'''"Lapland."''' Encyclopædia Britannica. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2009. Web. 24 November 2009 http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9047170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720013001/http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/eng_sami.pdf We are the Sámi – Fact sheets]. Gáldu Resource Centre for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being the namesake of the region, the Sami people are estimated to only make up around 5% of its total population.&lt;ref&gt;100,000 out of 2,000,000.&lt;/ref&gt; No political organization advocates secession, although several groups desire more territorial autonomy and/or more self-determination for the region's indigenous population.

The area is often referred to in [[English language|English]] as '''Lapland''' ({{IPAc-en|'|l|æ|p|l|ən|d}}), but this is erroneous since [[Laponia (historical province)|Lapland]] is more precisely [[Lapland (Sweden)|the interior parts of Swedish Sápmi]], and [[Lapland (Finland)|Finnish Sápmi]]. The Norwegian and Russian parts of Sápmi are not part of Lapland. Many Sámis oppose the use of the name Lapland, as it is considered derogatory and is not the name that Sámis have used. 

==Etymology==
Sápmi (and corresponding terms in other Sami languages) refers to both the Sami land and the Sami people. In fact, the word "Sámi" is only the accusative-genitive form of the noun "Sápmi"—making the name's (''Sámi olbmot'') meaning "people of Sápmi." The origin of the word is speculated to be related to the Baltic word ''*žēmē'' that simply means "land".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgr.fi/ct/ct51.html Article on the subject by the Finno-Ugrian Society.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also "[[Häme]]", the Finnish name for [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]], a historical province of Finland, is thought to have the same origin, and the same word is at least speculated to be the origin of "[[Finland|Suomi]]", the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] name for [[Finland]].
 
Sápmi is the name in North Sami, while the Julev Sami name is ''Sábme'' and the South Sami name is ''Saepmie''. In Norwegian and Swedish the term ''Sameland'' is often used.

In modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], Sápmi is known as "Sameland", but in older Swedish it was known as "[[Lappmarken]]", "Lappland", and [[Finnmark]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/egil/egil15.htm Egil's Saga, Chapter XIV]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2017 |reason= what does 'respectively' refer to?}} Originally these two names did refer to the entire Sápmi, but subsequently became applied to areas ''exclusively'' inhabited by the Sami. "[[Laponia (historical province)|Lappland]]" (Laponia) became the name of Sweden's northernmost province (''landskap'') which in 1809 was split into one part that remained Swedish and one part falling under Finland (which became part of the [[Russian Empire]]). "Lappland" survives as the name of both [[Lapland (Sweden)|Sweden's northernmost province]] and [[Lapland (Finland)|Finland's]], also containing part of the old [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnian]] province.

In older Norwegian, Sápmi was known as "Finnmork" or "Finnmark"; which is now the name of [[Finnmark|Norway's northernmost province]]. Both [[Northern Norway]] and [[Murmansk Oblast]] are sometimes marketed as ''Norwegian Lapland'' and ''Russian Lapland'', respectively.

In the 17th century, [[Johannes Schefferus]] assumed the etymology of the lesser used term "Lapland" to be related to the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word for "running", ''"löpa"'' (cognate with [[English language|English]], ''to leap'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.no/samidrum/lapponia/chap-i.html The History of Lapland: Chap. I: Of the name of ''Lapland''], Scheffer, John, Oxford, 1674&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Landscape===
The largest part of Sápmi lies north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. The western portion is an area of fjords, deep valleys, glaciers, and mountains, the highest point being Mount [[Kebnekaise]] (2,111 m/6,926&amp;nbsp;ft), in Swedish Lapland. The part of Sápmi falling on the Swedish side of the border is characterized by great rivers running from the northwest to the southeast. From the Norwegian province of Finnmark and eastwards, the terrain is that of a low plateau that contains many marshes and lakes, the largest of which is [[Lake Inari]] in Finnish Lapland. The extreme northeastern section lies within the [[tundra]] region, but it does not have [[permafrost]].

In the 19th century scientific expeditions to Sápmi were undertaken, for instance by [[Jöns Svanberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The climate is [[subarctic]] and vegetation is sparse, except in the densely forested southern portion. The mountainous west coast has significantly milder winters and more precipitation than the large areas east of the mountain chain. North of the Arctic Circle [[polar night]] characterize the winter season and [[midnight sun]] the summer season—both phenomena are longer the further north you go. Traditionally, the Sami divide the year in ''eight'' seasons instead of four.

===Natural resources===
[[Reindeer]], [[wolf]], bear, and birds are the main forms of animal life, in addition to a myriad of insects in the short summer. Sea and river [[fisheries]] abound in the region. Steamers are operated on some of the lakes, and many ports are ice-free throughout the year. All ports along the [[Norwegian Sea]] in the west and the [[Barents Sea]] in the northeast to [[Murmansk]] are ice-free all year. The [[Gulf of Bothnia]] usually freezes over in winter. The ocean floor to the north and west of Sápmi has deposits of petroleum and natural gas. Sápmi contains valuable mineral deposits, particularly iron ore in Sweden, copper in Norway, and nickel and [[apatite]] in Russia.

==Cultural subdivisions==

===East Sápmi===
''East Sápmi'' consists of the [[Kola peninsula]] and the [[Lake Inari]] region, and is home to the eastern Sami languages. While being the most heavily populated part of Sápmi, this is also the region where the indigenous population and their culture is weakest. Corresponds to the regions marked 6 through 9 on the map below.

===Central Sápmi===
''Central Sápmi'' consists of the western part of Finland's Sami Domicile Area, the parts of Norway north of the [[Saltfjellet]] mountains and areas on the Swedish side corresponding to this. Central Sápmi is the region where Sami culture is strongest, and home to North Sami—the most widely used Sami language. In the southernmost part of this subregion, however, Sami culture is rather weak—this is where the moribound ''Bithun'' Sami language is used. The areas around the [[Tysfjord]] fjord in Norway and the river [[Lule River|Lule]] in Sweden are home to the ''Julev'' Sami language, one of the more widely used Sami languages. These correspond to the regions marked 3 through 5 on the map below.

===South Sápmi===
''South Sápmi'' consists of the areas south of Saltfjellet and corresponding areas in Sweden, and is home to the southern languages. In this area Sami culture is mostly visible inland and on the coast of Baltic Sea, and the languages are spoken by few. Corresponds to the regions marked 1 and 2 on the map below plus [[Dalarna County]] to the south-east of region 1 in Sweden.

===Lapland===
The inner parts of Sápmi are often referred to as [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]] or Lappi, a name deriving from a former name given to the Sami, which is today considered derogatory by many Sami. The name is also found on the Russian side as ''Laplandige'' (the name of a natural reservation) and the Norwegian county of Finnmark is sometimes titled the "Norwegian Lapland", especially by the travel industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitnorway.com/templates/NTRDestinationArticle.aspx?id=157023 Presentation of Finnmark by Norway's Ministry of Trade and Industry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030638/http://www.visitnorway.com/templates/NTRDestinationArticle.aspx?id=157023 |date=28 September 2007 }} in their official travel guide to Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lappi-'' appears as a common component of place-names throughout central and southern Finland as well; in many cases, it probably refers to earlier Sami presence, though in some cases the underlying meaning may be merely "periphery" or "outlying district".

==="Sides"===
Finally, Sápmi may also be sub-divided into cultural regions according to the states' borders, that obviously affects daily life for people no matter their ethnicity. By Sami, these regions are commonly referred to as "sides", for example "the Norwegian side" (''norgga bealli'') or "the Finnish side" (''suoma bealli'').

==Languages==
[[Image:Corrected sami map 4.PNG|thumb|250px|Map of Saamic language areas&lt;br&gt;''(see text for explanation of numbers)'']]

===Sámi languages===
{{Main|Sami languages}}
The Saamic languages are the region's main minority languages and also its original languages. They belong to the [[Uralic language family]], and are most closely related to the [[Baltic-Finnic|Finnic]] languages. Many Sami languages are mutually unintelligible, but the languages originally formed a [[dialect continuum]] stretching southwest-northeast, so that a message could hypothetically be passed between Sami speakers from one end to the other and be understood by all. Today, however, many of the languages are [[moribund language|moribund]] and thus there are "gaps" in the original continuum.

On the map to the right numbers indicate Sámi Languages (Darkened areas represent municipalities that recognize Sami as an official language.): 1. South (Åarjil) Sámi, 2. Ume (Upme) Sámi, 3. Pite (Bitthun) Sámi, 4. Lule (Julev) Sámi, 5. North (Davvi) Sámi, 6. Skolt Sámi, 7. Inari (Ánár) Sámi, 8. Kildin Sámi, 9. Ter Sámi. Of these languages the Northern one is by far the most vital; whereas Ume, Pite and Ter seem to be dying languages. [[Kemi Sámi]] is extinct.

North Sami is subdivided into three main dialects: West, East and Coast. The written standard is based on the Western dialect.

===East Slavic languages===
{{Main|Russian language}}
The language spoken by most people in the region is Russian, which is an [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic language]]. It is the dominant language on the Russian side of the border and also spoken by recently immigrated minority groups elsewhere in Sápmi. Earlier, a common [[pidgin]] language was spoken on the northern coast of Sápmi that combined elements of Russian, Norwegian, North Sami and Kven. This language was known as [[Russenorsk]]. On the Russian side, there are also speakers of the East Slavic [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] languages.

===North Germanic (Scandinavian) languages===
{{Main|Norwegian language|Swedish language}}
Norwegian and Swedish dominate the largest part of Sápmi, including the entire Southern region and most of the Central region. There also used to be minorities speaking Norwegian on the Kola Peninsula. The Scandinavian languages are to a very large degree mutually intelligible, much more so than South Sami and North Sami. The Norwegian dialects spoken particularly in North and Central Norway Sami areas differ very much from the written [[bokmål]] standard. In Central Sápmi the Sámi dialects have taken the Scandinavian language trait of having a more or less constant emphasis on the first syllable of each spoken word. In the inner and northernmost parts of Sweden and Norway, however, people often speak Norwegian and Swedish close to the written standard, though with a heavy Uralic accent.

===Finnic languages===
{{Main|Meänkieli|Kven language|Finnish language}}
The Finnic (i.e. Baltic Finnic) languages are spoken on the Finnish (Finnish), Swedish (Meänkieli—spoken by the Tornedalians) and Norwegian (Kven) sides of the borders. There also used to be minorities speaking Finnish on the Kola Peninsula. The languages are as mutually intelligible as the Scandinavian languages. Other Finnic languages include [[Karelian language|Karelian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Livonian language|Livonian]], [[Veps language|Veps]], [[Votic language|Votic]] and [[Ingrian language|Izhoran]]. Many are mutually intelligible.

==Demography==
The approximate number of people living in Sápmi is about 2 million, though it is difficult to give the precise number of inhabitants since certain counties and provinces only include ''parts'' of Sápmi. It is also quite difficult to account for the distribution of ethnic groups as many people have double or multiple ethnic identities—both seeing themselves as members of the majority population ''and'' being part of one or more minority groups.

===Sami===
{{Main|Sami people}}
Different criteria are set when calculating the number of Sami, but the number is generally given as somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000. Many live in areas outside Sápmi such as [[Oulu]], [[Oslo]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Helsinki]].  Some Sami people have migrated to places outside the Sapmi vernacular region, such as in Canada and the United States. Many Sapmi people have settled in the northern parts of Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samiculturalcenter.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russians===
{{Main|Russians}}
About 900,000 people inhabit [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk province]] (oblast'), but parts of this area lie outside Sápmi. About 758,600 of Murmansk's population claim to be exclusively Russian. It should be noted, however, that ethnic Russians also live [[Russian diaspora|elsewhere]] in Sápmi. The Russian side of Sápmi is very ethnically diverse, with particularly big [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] minorities. The Sami are one of the minor minorities in this part of Sápmi.

===Norwegians===
{{Main|Norwegians}}
About 850,000 people inhabit the Norwegian regions [[North Norway]] (fully within Sápmi) and [[Trøndelag]] (mostly within Sápmi). However, many of the regions' inhabitants—particularly those of North Norway—are not exclusively Norwegian. Notable minority groups include the Sami, [[Finns]], and [[Kvens]].

===Swedes===
{{Main|Swedish people}}
About 700,000 people inhabit the Swedish counties [[Norrbotten]], [[Västerbotten]], [[Västernorrland]] and [[Jämtland]]. Many of the counties' inhabitants are not exclusively Swedish. Notable minority groups include the Sami, [[Tornedalians]], [[Kvens]], and [[Finns]].

===Finns===
{{Main|Finns}}
13,226 people inhabit the [[Sami native region (Finland)|Sami native region]] of [[Lapland, Finland]]. A great portion of these are Sami.

===Tornedalians and Kvens===
{{Main|Tornedalians|Kvens}}
These two ethnic groups, closely related to each other and also the Finns, mainly live on the Swedish and Norwegian sides of Sápmi, respectively.

==Politics==

===Sami political structures===
Norway, Finland and Sweden all have [[Sami Parliaments]] that to varying degrees are involved in governing the region—though mostly they only have authority over the matters of the Sami citizens of the states in which they are situated.

====Sami Parliaments====
[[Image:Samediggi03.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Sami Parliament of Norway]]
Every Norwegian citizen registered as a Sami has the right to vote in the elections for the [[Sami Parliament of Norway]]. Elections are held every four years by direct vote from 7 constituencies covering all of Norway (6 of which are in Sápmi), and run parallel to the general Norwegian parliamentary elections. This is the Sami Parliament with the most influence over any part of Sápmi, as it is involved in the autonomy established by the [[Finnmark Act]].The parliament is situated in [[Kárášjohka]] and its current President is [[Aili Keskitalo]] from the [[Norwegian Sami Association]].

The [[Sami Parliament of Sweden]], situated in [[Kiruna]] ([[Northern Sami]]: ''Giron''), is elected by a general vote where all registered Sami citizens of Sweden may attend. The current President is [[Lars-Anders Baer]].

Voting for elections to the [[Sámi Parliament of Finland]] is restricted to inhabitants of the [[Sami Domicile Area]]. The Parliament is located in [[Inari, Finland|Inari]] ({{lang-smn|Aanaar}}), and its current President is [[Pekka Aikio]].

In Russia there is no Sami Parliament. There are two Sami organizations that are members of the national umbrella organisation of indigenous peoples, the [[Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North]] and represent the Russian Sami in the Sami Council. RAIPON is represented in Russia's [[Public Chamber of Russia|Public Chamber]] by [[Pavel Sulyandziga]]. On 14 December 2008 the first Congress of the Russian Sámi took place. The Conference decided to demand the formation of a Russian Sámi Parliament, to be elected by the local Sami. A suggestion to have the Russian Federation pick representatives to the Parliament was voted down with a clear majority. The Congress also chose a Council of Representatives that were to work for the establishment of a Parliament and otherwise represent the Russian Sami. It is headed by [[Valentina Sovkina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?odas=3524&amp;giella1=nor |title=RUSSLAND: Samene vil ha et eget Sameting |publisher=Galdu.org |date=14 December 2008 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217221033/http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?odas=3524&amp;giella1=nor |archivedate=17 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sami Parliamentary Council====
On 2 March 2000, the Sami parliaments of Norway and Finland founded the Sami Parliamentary Council, and the Sami Parliament of Sweden joined two years later. Each parliament sends seven representatives, and observers are sent from the Sami organizations of Russia and the Sami Council (see below). The Sami Parliamentary Council discuss cross-border cooperation, hand out the annual ''Gollegiella'' language development award and represent the Sami people abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sametinget.se/1100 Samiskt parlamentariskt råd – Sametinget&lt;!--Bot-generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saami Council====
In addition to the parliaments and their common council, there is a [[Saami Council]] based on Saami organizations. This council also organizes inter-state cooperation between the Saami, and also often represent the Saami in international fora such as the [[Barents Region]]. This organization is older than the Parliamentary Council, but not connected to the parliaments except for the fact that some of the NGOs double as party lists in Sami parliament elections.

===Russian side===
The Russian Federation consists of several types of subunits. The Russian side of Sápmi is contained within an ''oblast'' (province). ''Oblasti'' are governed by popularly elected parliaments, and formally headed by governors. The governors are nominated by the [[President of the Russian Federation]], and accepted or discarded by the parliaments. However, should the parliament refuse to accept the President's nominee, the President is entitled to dissolve parliament and call for new ''oblast'' elections.

[[Murmansk Oblast]] covers the Kola Peninsula and is home to [[Murmansk|Murmánska]] ([[Northern Sami]]) or Murmansk ([[Russian language|Russian]]), the largest city north of the Arctic Circle and in Sápmi. It is subdivided into several [[raion|districts]], of which the geographically largest is [[Lovozersky District]]. This is also the part of Russia where the Sami population is most numerous and visible. In the west of the province there is a large natural reserve known as ''Laplandiya''. The current governor of Murmansk Province is Yuriy A. Yevdokimov,&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Евдокимов, Юрий Алексеевич|Евдокимов, Юрий Алексеевич]] on Russian Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; who has run the province since 1997 and helped found the pro-Putin party ''Jedinstvo'' that after Putin's victory combined with its main opponent to become the [[United Russia|''Yedinaya Rossiya'' Party]].

===Norwegian side===
The counties of Norway  are governed by [[County council (Norway)|popularly elected assemblies]], headed by county mayors. Formally, the counties are headed by [[County governor (Norway)|county governors]], but in practice these have limited influence today.

The largest of Norway's counties, [[Finnmark|Finmárku]] ([[Northern Sami]]) or Finnmark ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), is located in Sápmi and has a special form of autonomy: 95% (about 46,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the area is owned by the [[Finnmark Estate]]. The board of the Estate consists of equally many representatives from the [[Sami Parliament of Norway]] and Finnmark's county council.  The two institutions appoint leaders of the board alternately. The administrative centre of Finmárku is [[Vadsø|Čáhcesuolu]] or Vadsø, located far east in the county. The current [[County governor (Norway)|county governor]] is [[Runar Sjåstad]] from the [[Norwegian Labour Party]].

[[Troms|Romsa]] or Troms is situated to the southwest of Finmárku. Its administrative centre is the city after which the county is named, [[Tromsø|Romsa]] or Tromsø. Romsa is North Norway's biggest city and Sápmi's biggest city after [[Murmansk]]. Current ''fylkesordfører'' is [[Terje Olsen (politician)|Terje Olsen]] from the [[Høyre|Conservative Party]]. A similar solution to the Finnmark Estate, [[Hålogalandsallmenningen]], has been proposed for Romsa county and its southern neighbour Nordlánda.

[[Nordland]] or Nordlánda (not official name) covers a long strip of coast that includes both North Sami, Julev Sami, Bithun Sami and South Sami areas. Its administrative centre is [[Bodø|Bådåddjo]] or Bodø. The current county governor is [[Mariette Korsrud]] from the [[Norwegian Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nordland/1.3747610 Korsrud Nordlands første], NRK, Retrieved 31 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The southernmost parts of Norwegian Sapmi lie in [[Nord-Trøndelag]] and partially in [[Sør-Trøndelag]], and the administrative centres of which are [[Steinkjer]] and [[Trondheim]] respectively. The latter city is outside Sápmi but well known for being the site of the [[Sami assembly of 1917|first international Sami conference]] in February 1917. The county governors are [[Gunnar Viken]] (the [[Høyre|Conservative Party]]) in Nord-Trøndelag and [[Tore Sandvik]] ([[Norwegian Labour Party]]) in Sør-Trøndelag.

===Swedish side===
"[[Lapland (Sweden)|Lappland]]" is the name of a large northwestern [[province of Sweden]], wholly within Sápmi. The traditional provinces of Sweden are cultural and historical entities; for administrative and political purposes they were replaced by the [[counties of Sweden]] (län) in 1634.

Five counties are wholly or partially within Sápmi. ''Län'' are formally governed by the ''landshövding'', who is an envoy of the government and runs the government-appointed  ''länsstyrelse'' that coordinates administration with national political goals for the county. Much of county politics is run by the county council or ''landsting'', which is elected by the inhabitants of the county; but the counties' top positions are still determined by those who win the general elections of Sweden.

[[Norrbotten County|Norrbotten]] is more or less covered by Sápmi, although the lower [[Tornedalen]] region is often excluded. The administrative centre is Luleå in the Julev Sami area (Norrbotten includes North, Julev and Bithun areas). Current landshövding is [[Per-Ola Eriksson]] of the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]].

Sápmi covers the interior majority of [[Västerbotten County|Västerbotten]], which are Upmeje and South Sami regions. The administrative centre is [[Umeå]], and the current landshövding is [[Chris Heister]] from the conservative [[Moderate Party]].

[[Västernorrland]] is an old part of Sapmi and still is. There is a lot of Sami in the coast of Baltic Sea (Gulf of Bothnia).

[[Jämtland County|Jämtland]] is wholly within Sápmi, and is a South Sami county. The administrative centre is [[Östersund]]. Current landshövding is [[Maggi Kristina Maria Mikaelsson]] from the socialist [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]].

Sápmi covers the interior majority of [[Dalarna County|Dalarna]], which is traditionally a South Sami region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arkiv.daltid.se/1998/07/19980731/FK-19980731-15.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012708/http://arkiv.daltid.se/1998/07/19980731/FK-19980731-15.pdf |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }} {{cite web |url=http://arkiv.daltid.se/1998/06/19980609/FK-19980609-17.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005213017/http://arkiv.daltid.se/1998/06/19980609/FK-19980609-17.pdf |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish side===
Finland is subdivided into [[Regions of Finland|nineteen regions]] (''maakunta''). The regions are governed by regional councils, which are generally forums of cooperation between the municipalities and not elected by direct popular vote. [[Lapland (Finland)|"Lapland"]] ("Lappi") is the name of the northernmost of the regions, which stretches further south than Sápmi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3140">'''Tapori''' literally translates into [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]] or rowdy in [[Hindi]]. Street thugs in [[Mumbai]] were perhaps the most notable taporis. Their unique style of speaking Hindi was called tapori language. They also had a unique style of dressing, which they called as tapori style. Tapori culture though resented by many is widely imitated by many as humorous or comical. It has found acceptance in [[Bollywood]] films including "[[Rangeela 6(film)|Rangeela]]", "Gol Mal", and "[[Chashme Buddoor (1981 film)|Chasme Buddoor]]".&lt;ref name="Mazumdar"&gt;Mazumdar, R. 2007.  ''Bombay Cinema: An Archive of the City''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press&lt;/ref&gt; They are the equivalent of [[Gangster|gangstas]] in [[Hollywood]] films. 

Their style of speaking Hindi is a mixture of many languages spoken by people in Mumbai. It has words adapted mainly from [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and some from [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]].

Tapori is an original Marathi word meaning "blossomed", fully fertile or at its peak in growth, which during its evolution/progression (towards the dark side) in the Marathi language started as its application to someone with high youth elements or budding hormones and subsequent behavior of that animal/humans to establish control, create mischief, attract attention of opposite sex and other such indulgences. Bollywood being in Maharashtra (a Marathi speaking state), it inherited that word into its Hindi vocabulary as a "cool-happening" style statement; all such similar words from Marathi used to be recognized in Marathi as Tapori language (i.e. words which were considered "not decent" to use in regular language and are mostly used by people who are deemed anti-social or with similar stature). All such words in Marathi got imported as-is into Bambaiya Hindi with additions from other local languages.

Changing social conditions in India have led to a shortage of work for educated lower middle-class young men.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jeffrey|first=Craig|title=Timepass: Youth, class, and time among unemployed young men in India|journal=American Ethnologist|date=14 July 2010|volume=37|issue=3|page=466|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1425.2010.01266.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2010.01266.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rise of this archetype in Indian cinema in the 1990s and 2000s coincides with the real-life social phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Mazumdar" /&gt;

The children's network of [[ATD Fourth World]] is named Tapori. ATD's founder [[Joseph Wresinski]] met a group of children living in Mumbai train stations known as 'Tapori'. Wresinski noticed how these children shared among themselves what food they had. He was so moved that he decided to call ATD's children's network Tapori. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atd-fourthworld.org/get-involved/tapori-children-network/ Tapori Children&amp;#039;s Network - ATD Fourth World]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timothy Charles Peto Everest'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Timothy Everest |url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/madgdocs/en/2006/madrid_g_2006_26.pdf |format=PDF |journal=WIPO Gazette of International Marks |publisher=[[World Intellectual Property Organization]] |publication-place=[[Geneva]] |publication-date=3 August 2006 |volume=11 |issue=26 |page=76 |issn=1020-4679}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born March 1961) is a Welsh [[tailor]] and [[fashion designer]] who has, according to ''[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]'', "dressed some of the world's most famous people". Born in [[Southampton]] and raised in [[Haverfordwest]], he moved to London in his early twenties to work with innovative [[Savile Row]] tailor [[Tommy Nutter]], where he learned the art of bespoke. Everest was one of the leaders of the [[New Bespoke Movement]], which brought designer attitudes to the traditional skills of Savile Row tailoring.

Everest has been running his own tailoring business in the [[East End of London]] since 1989. Based at his [[Spitalfields]] [[atelier]] since 1993, he opened a [[West End of London|West End]] store off [[Bond Street]], near Savile Row, in 2008. As well as collaborating on projects with designers and brands such as [[Brooks England]], [[Simpsons of Piccadilly|DAKS]], [[Kim Jones (designer)|Kim Jones]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi's]], [[Rapha (sportswear)|Rapha]] and [[Rocawear]], as [[costume design]]er Everest has dressed the stars of films including the first two ''[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' films, ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', ''[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]'' and ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]''. He has been associated with the British high street retailer [[Marks and Spencer]] since 1999, and has been a contributor to men's magazine ''[[The Rake]]'' since 2008. Everest is at the forefront of the ''bespoke casual'' movement.

==Early life==
Everest was born in [[Southampton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=Rwtt6VmjbYGSUaeH%2FP%2B3Ew&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=21 August 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; but brought up in [[Haverfordwest]]; most of his family remain in the area.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bespoke tailor fan of PM's style |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/6265468.stm |accessdate=25 November 2010 |date=3 July 2007 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were restaurateurs.&lt;ref name="Revolution"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Koh |first=Wei |title=Timothy Everest – One man to rule them all |magazine=[[Revolution (magazine)|Revolution]] |pages=129–141 |date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had aspired to become a racing driver.&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KogNKkZBjWA&amp;NR=1 |title=Timothy Everest Collection Introduction for M&amp;S |date=4 November 2010 |work=YouTube |format=YouTube |publisher=[[Marks &amp; Spencer|Marks &amp; Spencer TV]] |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, his ambition unfulfilled, he took a job with his uncle when he was 17, working as a sales assistant at [[Joseph Hepworth (tailor)|Hepworths]], [[Milford Haven]]; a high street tailor that would form the foundation of the [[Next (clothing)|Next]] retail empire.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arburtian"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tinker, Tailor, Timothy Everest |author=Lipkin, Ash J. |url=http://www.arbuturian.com/2010/timothy-everest |publisher=''[[The Arbuturian]]'' |location=London |accessdate=21 May 2010 |date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, he became interested in the [[Nightclub#1980s New York, London &amp; Europe|club scene]], often driving to London, where he mixed with [[New Romanticism|New Romantics]] such as [[Boy George]] at ''The Blitz''; a trendy London nightclub run by [[Steve Strange]] of the group [[Visage (band)|Visage]].&lt;ref name="Arburtian"/&gt;

Determined to become part of the fashion industry, but unable to make a breakthrough, Everest decided to use his knowledge of tailoring to his advantage. He answered an advertisement placed in the ''[[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]]'', in 1982, by [[Tommy Nutter]]; 'Boy wanted in Savile Row'.&lt;ref name="Arburtian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news |title=A New Peak For Everest |last=Buttolph |first=Angela |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/a-new-peak-for-everest-1328771.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=25 February 2011 |date=14 July 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savile Row"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Savile Row |url=http://www.savilerowbespoke.com/History/History_of_Savile_Row/ |publisher=[[Savile Row#Savile Row Bespoke Association|Savile Row Bespoke Association]] |accessdate=7 April 2010 |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716012132/http://www.savilerowbespoke.com/History/History_of_Savile_Row/ |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pestered Nutter for weeks, until he was given the job.&lt;ref name="Arburtian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim.co.uk/fashion_old/news/2720/timothy_everest.html |title=Timothy Everest: Everest in collaboration with Italian shoemaker Regain |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing|Dennis Publishing Ltd]] |accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutter's client base included rock stars, celebrities, politicians and businessmen; he famously dressed [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones|The Stones]].&lt;ref name="Maxim"/&gt; Everest also mixed with future celebrities of the fashion world. [[John Galliano]], who had been studying at the [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]], passed on some design skills to Everest, while on work placement with Nutter.&lt;ref name="Arburtian"/&gt; Everest met his future wife Catherine (now an actress and film producer) at this time, while she was also working with Nutter.&lt;ref name="Innocent"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Innocent'' |url=http://www.innocentthefilm.com/fileadmin/files/EPK__PDF.pdf |format=PDF |page=2 |accessdate=17 March 2011 |year=2010 |publisher=Innocent the Film |work=''Innocent'' the film, press pack }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have two daughters.&lt;ref name="MBE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timothy Everest Receiving my MBE |url=http://blog.timothyeverest.co.uk/2010/03/it-seems-only-yesterday-that-i-received.html |accessdate=10 March 2011 |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Timothy Everest |work=Timothy Everest website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everest's time under Nutter, a Savile Row revolutionary in the 1960s, inspired him to experiment with tone and pattern in his own designs. In 1986, after nearly five years as Nutter's apprentice, Everest was persuaded to move on to work for Malcolm Levene.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; He had become disillusioned with Savile Row, particularly with their lack of appreciation for Nutter's more modern approach.&lt;ref name="Arburtian"/&gt; Everest found that working with Levene, a small menswear retailer based away from Savile Row, on Chiltern Street, provided a welcome change. During Everest's first year there, Levene's turnover doubled.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Atelier, external.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Timothy Everest's [[Spitalfields]] ''atelier''&lt;/center&gt;|alt=Early Georgian brick terraced house, on four levels, including the basement. Each upper floor has three sash windows. The ground floor has two and a wooden entrance door. The basement is separated from street access by spiked metal railings. A single chimney stack is on the roof, three chimney pots are visible. A blue plaque is at ground floor level. A Victorian (formally gas) street lamp is to the right of the house]]

===Setting out on his own===
Leaving Levene in the late 1980s to become a freelance [[wardrobe stylist|stylist]] in television advertising, [[MTV]] and film, Everest began styling bands and pop stars such as [[George Michael]]. He recognised a shift in perception of the male fashion industry; men had become more [[Designer label|label]] conscious. This had coincided with the increased awareness of top-end fashion [[Designer clothing|designers]], like [[Hugo Boss]] and [[Armani]], highlighted by men's lifestyle magazines; such as ''[[Arena (magazine)|Arena]]'' and ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]''. He said, "I thought that if we could demystify bespoke tailoring and make it more accessible, as well as really understanding what was going on in ready-to-wear fashion and being directional with it, there was possibly a market there." Having decided to create the ''Timothy Everest'' brand as an alternative to 'designer' ready-to-wear, he searched for a suitable location away from "the stuffiness of Savile Row".&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YouTube"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arburtian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who is?"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Timothy Everest |url=http://www.timothyeverest.co.uk/who-is |accessdate=27 February 2011 |year=2010 |publisher=Timothy Everest|work=Timothy Everest website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everest opened his first premises in 1989; in Princelet Street, [[Spitalfields]], just outside the [[City of London]], in the [[East End of London|East End]].&lt;ref name="Princelet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timothy Everest Timothy Everest: A Potted History (part 1) |url=http://blog.timothyeverest.co.uk/2011/03/timothy-everest-potted-history-part-1.html|accessdate=10 March 2011 |date=2 March 2011 |publisher=Timothy Everest |work=Timothy Everest website}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "We started in one room of a house. We had one rail with four garments on and a telephone, no chairs, no furniture."

===Bespoke active wear===
A keen cyclist, in 2009 Everest collaborated with cyclewear brand [[Rapha (sportswear)|Rapha]] to develop a bespoke suit that could be worn while cycling; what he called "bespoke active wear". Priced at £3,500, the three-piece suit was made of blended wool, using [[nanotechnology]] to repel water and dirt. It combined the functionality of classic cycling clothing with the elegance of bespoke tailoring. Its features included a high button fastening to keep the jacket closely fitted to the body, a lapel pocket for an [[Digital audio player|MP3 player]] and pleats at the shoulders and center back to allow extra fabric when the rider was bent over the bicycle.&lt;ref name="Best Life"&gt;{{cite journal|title=London Calling: Riding around a British tailor's bespoke world |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8cDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=Best Life |volume=5 |issue=8 |page=80 |publisher=[[Rodale, Inc.]]|location=[[Emmaus, Pennsylvania]] |issn=1548-212X|accessdate=29 July 2010 |date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timothy Everest and the Boultbee Jacket |url=

The ''Timothy Everest'' brand has three levels of tailoring. '[[Bespoke]]' is aimed at young professionals with the means to purchase bespoke tailoring, but not necessarily the desire to visit Savile Row.

'''The Umbrella Cover Museum''' in [[Peaks Island, Maine]] is a [[museum]] that pays tribute to [[umbrella]] covers. The museum was created and is curated by Nancy&amp;nbsp;3. &lt;!-- not a typo --&gt; Hoffman, who has collected more than 2000&amp;nbsp;umbrella covers from 66&amp;nbsp;countries as of July 2018.&lt;ref name=Skelton&gt;{{cite web|last1=Skelton|first1=Kathryn|title=Weird, Wicked Weird: The largest (and only) Umbrella Cover Museum in the world|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/news/maine/2015/07/03/weird-wicked-weird-largest-and-only-umbrella-cover-museum-world/1732947|publisher=Sun Journal|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Umbrella Cover Museums states that it is "dedicated to the appreciation of the mundane in everyday life. It is about finding wonder and beauty in the simplest of things, and about knowing that there is always a story behind the cover."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy 3. Hoffman, Director and Curator&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the museum came when Hoffman was cleaning out a closet and came across seven umbrella covers.&lt;ref name=EA&gt;[http://www.eccentricamerica.com/umbrella.htm “Umbrella Cover Museum,” Eccentric America]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum began in Hoffman’s kitchen and was moved to a larger location as the collection grew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.mainetoday.com/onlyinmaine/umbrellacovermuseum.shtml “Umbrella Cover Today,” Maine Today Travel]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum’s collection ranges in size from a  two-and-a-half-inch [[Barbie doll]] cover to a six-foot patio umbrella sleeve. It has hosted special exhibitions including “People and Their Covers” and “New Umbrella Cover Fashions.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X3L-D9i9BOMC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=%22umbrella+cover+museum%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=n0ZEN8jGkd&amp;sig=MHnRrdZdfmkgGT1m3KKHbdpqinc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result#PPA67,M1 ''Curious New England''] by Joseph A. Citro, Diane E. Foulds, Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2012, ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' named Hoffman's umbrella cover collection of 730 at the time to be the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest collection of umbrella sleeves|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-collection-of-umbrella-sleeves/|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is closed during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E2DE1430F933A2575AC0A9629C8B63&amp;amp;amp;sec=&amp;amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 “HAVENS; The Seductions of Fall,”] ''[[New York Times]]'', September 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Guided tours include Hoffman, who is also a musician, singing "[[Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella]]" while playing an [[accordion]].&lt;ref name=BG&gt;[http://www.boston.com/travel/explorene/galleries/quirky_museums?pg=4 “Umbrella Cover Museum,”] ''[[Boston Globe]]'', October 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Toilet Day''' ('''WTD''') is an official [[United Nations]] [[List of international observances|international observance day]] on 19 November to inspire action to tackle the global [[sanitation]] crisis.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldtoiletday.info/|title=What is World Toilet Day?|last=|first=|date=|website=World Toilet Day|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=Call to action on UN website|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, 4.5 billion people live without "[[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]]"&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and around 892 million people practise open defecation.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt; [[Sustainable Development Goal 6]] aims to achieve sanitation for all and end open defecation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/|title=Goal 6: Ensure access to water and sanitation for all|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Toilet Day exists to inform, engage and inspire people to take action toward achieving this goal.

World Toilet Day was established by the [[World Toilet Organization]] in 2001. Twelve years later, the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] declared World Toilet Day an official UN day in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/toiletday/background.shtml|title=World Toilet Day 19 November - Background|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UN-Water]] is the official convener of World Toilet Day. UN-Water maintains the official World Toilet Day website and chooses a special theme for each year. In 2018 the theme is [[nature-based solutions]]. Themes in previous years included [[wastewater]], "toilets and jobs" and "toilets and nutrition".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  World Toilet Day is marked by communications campaigns and other activities. Events are planned by [[UN entity|UN entities]], international organizations, local [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organizations]] and volunteers to raise awareness and inspire action.

[[Toilet|Toilets]] are important because access to a safe functioning toilet has a positive impact on [[public health]], [[dignity|human dignity]], and personal safety, especially for women.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; Sanitation systems that do not safely treat excreta allow the spread of disease.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt; Serious [[soil-transmitted helminthiasis|soil-transmitted diseases]] and [[waterborne diseases]] such as [[cholera]], [[diarrhea]], [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]], [[dysentery]] and [[schistosomiasis]] can result.

== Convener ==

In 2013, [[UN-Water]] and the "Thematic Priority Area (TPA) on Drinking Water and Basic Sanitation" received the mandate to oversee World Toilet Day each year. This mandate is described in the United Nations Resolution A/67/L.75.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/GA%20Sanitation%20for%20All%20resolution%2024%20July.pdf|title=UN resolution A/67/L.75|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In consultation with the UN-Water World Toilet Day Task Force, made up of UN-Water member organizations, UN-Water selects the theme based on that year's [[UN World Water Development Report|World Water Development Report]] and develops content for World Toilet Day communications campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwater.org/what-we-do/inspire-action/|title=UN-Water’s Campaigns|last=|first=|date=|website=UN-Water (United Nations)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN-Water manages the World Toilet Day website which promotes key issues and stories, provides communications and campaigns resources, and announces events and opportunities to participate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The overall World Toilet Day campaign mobilizes civil society, think tanks, [[non-governmental organizations]], academics, corporations and the general public to participate in the associated social media and communications campaigns.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Ultimately, the aim is to encourage organizations and governments to plan activities and action on [[sanitation]] issues to make progress on [[Sustainable Development Goal 6]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Themes ==
[[File:World Toilet Day celebrations in Singapore 2016.jpg|thumb|Leading "The Big Squat" during the [[Singapore]] "Urgent Run" 2016 is [[Jack Sim]], front row left, founder of [[World Toilet Organization]].]]
Starting in 2012, World Toilet Day themes were selected for each year and form the basis of the related communications campaigns. Since 2016, the same overall annual theme has been used for both World Toilet Day and [[World Water Day]], based on the [[UN World Water Development Report|World Water Development Report]].

== Examples of activities and events ==

=== Urgent Run ===

In the lead-up to World Toilet Day, communities worldwide come together for sanitation-themed "Urgent Runs". More than 63 events were held in 42 countries. Events included fun runs, awareness walks, toilet cleaning programs, carnivals and even motorbike parades.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urgentrun.com/why.php|title=What's the urgency?|last=|first=|date=|website=The Urgent Run|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizers unite communities around the world to raise awareness of the global sanitation challenge and engage people with sanitation issues in their local communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Community groups, private companies, universities and NGOs plan events all over the world. Countries participating include: Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, China, Congo-Brazzaville, France, Gambia, Germany, Ghana, India,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsgram.com/the-urgent-run-to-address-sanitation-problem-in-delhi/|title=The Urgent Run to address sanitation problems in Delhi|last=|first=|date=2 November 2015|work=NewsGram|access-date=13 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, Tanzania, United States and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://giaoduc.net.vn/Giao-duc-24h/Hon-2000-ban-tre-chay-khan-cap-vi-nha-ve-sinh-sach-post163375.gd|title=More than 2,000 young people run urgently because of clean toilets|last=|first=|date=15 November 2015|work=Electronic newspaper Vietnam Education|access-date=13 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Launch of reports ===
Some organizations launch [[toilet]]-related (or sanitation-related) reports on World Toilet Day. For example:

=== Public education ===
Members of the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) used the momentum around World Toilet Day in 2017 to update [[Wikipedia]] articles on [[WASH]]-related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldtoiletday.info/meet-up-on-wikipedia/|title=Meet up on Wikipedia!|last=|first=|date=|website=World Toilet Day (UN Water)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributes to public education about the sanitation crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sei-international.org/press/press-releases/3771|title=Join the SuSanA Sanitation Wikipedia project|last=|first=|date=10 October 2017|website=Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary "Follow the Flush," released 19 November 2017, educates people about what happens beneath the streets of [[New York City]] after a person flushes a toilet in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepoopproject.org/flush-watch|title=Follow the Flush|last=Mangu-Ward|first=Karina|date=16 November 2017|website=The Poop Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impacts==
In 2016, the World Toilet Day campaign and related publications reached millions of people through [[social media]], dedicated websites and other channels.&lt;ref name="UNWater2016"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/un-water-annual-report-2016/|title=Annual Report UN-Water 2016|last=|first=|publisher=UN-Water|year=2016|isbn=|location=Geneva, Switzerland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} Over 100 events in 40 countries were registered on the World Toilet Day website in both 2016 and in 2017.&lt;ref name="UNWater2016" /&gt;{{rp|23}}&lt;ref name="UNWater2017" /&gt;{{rp|17}} The UN-Water Annual Report states that in 2017 the hashtag #WorldToiletDay had a maximum potential reach of around 750 million people on social media.&lt;ref name="UNWater2017"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/un-water-annual-report-2017/|title=Annual Report UN-Water 2017|last=|first=|publisher=UN-Water|year=2017|isbn=|location=Geneva, Switzerland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}}

== History ==
[[File:2013 World Toilet Day at United Nations, New York.jpg|thumb|World Toilet Day officially declared in 2013 at the 67th session of the [[UN general assembly|UN General Assembly]] in New York.]]

On 19 November 2001, the [[World Toilet Organization]] (WTO) was founded by [[Jack Sim]], a [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] from [[Singapore]]. He subsequently declared 19 November as World Toilet Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/11/19/dont-laugh-world-toilet-day-aims-to-promote-sanitation-rid-world-disease.html|title=Don't Laugh: World Toilet Day Aims to Promote Sanitation, Rid World of Disease|date=19 November 2008|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WTO later the UN chose the name "World Toilet Day" and not "World Sanitation Day" for ease of public messaging. In fact, toilets are only the first stage of sanitation systems.&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|last1=Tilley|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Ulrich|first2=Lukas|last3=Lüthi|first3=Christoph|last4=Reymond|first4=Philippe|last5=Zurbrügg|first5=Chris|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|edition=2nd|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Toilet Day events and public awareness campaigns increase public awareness of the broader sanitation systems that include [[wastewater treatment]], [[fecal sludge management]], [[municipal solid waste]] management, [[stormwater]] management, [[hygiene]], and [[handwashing]]. Also, the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]] call for more than just toilets. [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Goal 6]] calls for adequate sanitation, which includes the whole system for assuring that waste is safely processed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The WTO began pushing for global recognition for World Toilet Day and, in 2007, the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) began to actively support World Toilet Day, too.&lt;ref&gt;Gröber, K., McCreary, C., Kappauf, L., Panzerbieter, T., Rück, J. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/749 Public awareness raising and sanitation marketing – Factsheet of Working Group 9b]. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts to raise attention for the sanitation crisis were bolstered in 2010 when the [[human right to water and sanitation]] was officially declared a [[human right]] by the UN.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 2013, a joint initiative between the [[Government of Singapore]] and the World Toilet Organization led to Singapore's first UN resolution, named "Sanitation for All". The resolution calls for collective action to end the world's sanitation crisis. World Toilet Day was declared an official UN day in 2013. That resolution was adopted by 122 countries at the 67th session of the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;World Toilet Organisation: [http://worldtoilet.org/what-we-do/world-toilet-day/ World Toilet Day]. Retrieved 5 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) replaced the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) in 2016. On World Toilet Day on 19 November 2015, United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] urged broad action to renew efforts to provide access to adequate sanitation for all. He reminded everyone of the "Call to Action on Sanitation" which was launched in 2013, and the aim to end [[open defecation]] by 2025.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52596#.WguEy1T9SUl|title=Marking World Toilet Day, UN urges ‘open, frank’ discussion on importance of hygiene and sanitation|last=|first=|date=19 November 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said: “By many accounts, sanitation is the most-missed target of the Millennium Development Goals."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The UN Deputy Secretary-General, [[Jan Eliasson]], was honored on World Toilet Day in 2016 in New York for his deep commitment to breaking the sanitation [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="UNWater2016" /&gt;{{rp|23}} For example, he had delivered a video message to attendees of a [[WaterAid]] and [[Unilever]] joint event in the [[European Parliament]] on World Toilet Day 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU9NE6aXutc|title=A message from the UN Deputy Secretary-General on World Toilet Day 2014|last=|first=|date=17 November 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, UN-Water supported “A Toast for Toilets” in New York with the United Nations Mission of Singapore.&lt;ref name="UNWater2016" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

Worldwide, 4.5 billion people live without "[[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]]".&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt; Around 892 million people worldwide practise [[open defecation]]. Of those, 678 million live in just seven countries. [[India]] has the highest number of people (about 525 million) practising open defecation.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt; Having to defecate in the open is especially difficult for women and girls. Women tend to resort to the cover of darkness to give them more privacy, but then risk being attacked when alone at night.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavill|first1=Sue|title=Violence, gender and WASH: A practitioner's toolkit: Making Water, Sanitation and hygiene safer through improved programming and services|url=http://violence-wash.lboro.ac.uk/|publisher=WaterAid, SHARE Research Consortium|access-date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lennon|first1=Shirley|title=Fear and anger: Perceptions of risks related to sexual violence against women linked to water and sanitation in Delhi, India|journal=SHARE (Sanitation and Hygiene Applied Research for Equity) and WaterAid, UK|date=November 2011|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1758|access-date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that 58% of all cases of [[diarrhea]] worldwide in 2015 were caused by unsafe water, poor sanitation and poor hygiene practices, such as inadequate [[handwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Burden of disease from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene in low- and middle-income settings: a retrospective analysis of data from 145 countries|date=2014|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.12329/abstract|journal=Tropical Medicine|volume=19|pages=894–905|doi=10.1111/tmi.12329|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in half a million children under the age of five dying from diarrhea per year.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|title=UNICEF: Ending Child Deaths from Pneumonia and Diarrhoea|date=2015|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Pneumonia_Diarrhoea_brochure.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing sanitation has been estimated to lower the odds of children suffering diarrhea by 7–17%, and under-five mortality by 5–20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunther|first1=Isabel|last2=Fink|first2=Gunther|date=April 2010|title=Water, Sanitation and Children’s Health Evidence from 172 DHS Surveys|url=https://sanitationupdates.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/worldbank-dhs2010.pdf|journal=The World Bank Development Economics Prospects Group|issue=5275|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human right to water and sanitation|Human Right to Water and Sanitation]] was recognized as a [[human right]] by the [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations (UN) General Assembly]] on 28 July 2010. Lack of access to [[sanitation]] (toilets) has an impact on [[public health]], [[dignity]], and safety.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; The spread of many diseases (e.g. [[soil-transmitted helminthiasis]], [[diarrhea]], [[schistosomiasis]]) and [[stunted growth]] in children is directly related to people being exposed to [[human feces]] because toilets are either not available or not used.

[[Sustainable Development Goal 6]] aims to provide sanitation for all.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;

'''Zoe Pound''' is a criminal [[street gang]] based in [[Miami, Florida]] founded by [[Haitians|Haitian]] immigrants in the Mid 1990s.&lt;ref name=FBI&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |location=Indianapolis |date=4 February 2010 |url=http://indianapolis.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/ip020410.htm |title=Twenty-Two Charged Federally in Evansville Drug Trafficking Case |accessdate=20 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817115452/http://indianapolis.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/ip020410.htm |archive-date=17 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Zoe'' is the anglicized variant of the word ''Zo'', which is [[Haitian Creole]] to mean ''bone,'' whose members were known to be "hard to the bone." When conflicts against Haitians arose, the ''pound'' would be sought out to retaliate, thus the street gang name, ''Zoe Pound'' came to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j12DHZyxewAC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=zoe+pound+means&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SuLDYfoRWi&amp;sig=fuLnboK0dOYrrByUXpBzIwJIE_I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=maIrVODFIImryASMzoGQCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=zoe%20pound%20means&amp;f=false |title=Magic City: Trials of a Native Son |author1=Daddy, Trick |author2=Bailey, Peter |page=169 |isbn=978-1-4391-4852-5 |accessdate=1 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312131837/https://books.google.com/books?id=j12DHZyxewAC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=zoe+pound+means&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SuLDYfoRWi&amp;sig=fuLnboK0dOYrrByUXpBzIwJIE_I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=maIrVODFIImryASMzoGQCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=zoe%20pound%20means&amp;f=false |archive-date=12 March 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having branched out from Miami in the two decades leading up to 2010, they are known to be involved in drug trafficking and robbery and related violent crimes in support of their drug trafficking activities in [[Evansville, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=FBI/&gt;

In 2004, six Zoe Pound leaders were arrested on [[racketeering]] and conspiracy charges in [[Fort Pierce, Florida]] after [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]] offices convinced several gang members to [[Turn state's evidence|give testimony for the prosecution]].&lt;ref name=ftpierce&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenlee |first=Will |date=18 June 2009 |publisher=TCPalm |url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/jun/18/six-alleged-leaders-of-fort-pierce-gang-facing/ |title=Six alleged leaders of Fort Pierce gang facing charges |accessdate=26 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194638/http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/jun/18/six-alleged-leaders-of-fort-pierce-gang-facing/ |archive-date=16 July 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
