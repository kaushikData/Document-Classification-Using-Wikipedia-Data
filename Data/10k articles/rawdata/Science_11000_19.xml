The '''Bloch spectrum''' is a concept in [[quantum mechanics]] in the field of theoretical [[physics]]; this concept addresses certain energy spectra considerations.
Let ''H'' be the one-dimensional [[Schrödinger equation]] operator

:&lt;math&gt; H = - \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + U_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[periodic function]] of period ''α''. The Bloch spectrum&lt;ref&gt;"An upper bound on the allowed bands of the Bloch spectrum of one-dimensional Schrödinger operators with periodic potentials", N. N. Meiman, ''Journal of Mathematical Physics'', March, 1983, volume 24, issue 3, pp. 539–540 &lt;/ref&gt; of ''H'' is defined as the set of values ''E'' for which all the solutions of (''H''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''E'')φ = 0 are bounded on the whole [[real axis]]. The Bloch spectrum consists of the half-line ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''E'' from which certain closed intervals [''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''j''−1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''j''&lt;/sub&gt;] (''j'' = 1, 2, ...) are omitted. These are forbidden bands (or gaps) so the (''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''j''−2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''j''−1&lt;/sub&gt;) are allowed bands.

'''Brain Balance Achievement Centers''' are after-school learning centers that offers a program of brain training, exercise, simple physical exercises, skills training, and dietary advice that it says helps children with developmental and learning disabilities.&lt;ref name =NPR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;

As of 2018 there was no good evidence that the company's program helps children.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; In the scientific and medical community, Brain Balance has been criticized for the lack of scientific evidence for its marketing, as well as its claims about [[neuroplasticity]] and other aspects of brain development.&lt;ref name=sciencebasedmedicine&gt;{{cite web | last = Hall | first = Harriet | name-list-format = vanc | date = 14 September 2010 | url = https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/brain-balance/ | title = Brain Balance | work = [[Science-Based Medicine]] | access-date = 16 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jsonline&gt;{{cite web | last = Boulton | first = Guy | name-list-format = vanc | date = 14 November 2010 | url = http://archive.jsonline.com/business/108047584.html/ | title = Doctors skeptical of center's claims | work = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | access-date = 16 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That assessment is consistent with a 2015 determination by the [[Wisconsin Department of Health Services]] that there was insufficient evidence of effectiveness for the company's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Treatment Intervention Advisory Committee Review and Determination | title = Brain Balance | date = January 2015 |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4515111-Wisconsin-DHS-Brain-Balance-January-2015-1.html#document/p5/a429474 |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Health Services |accessdate=19 June 2018 | quote = The committee concludes there continues to be insufficient evidence to consider Brain Balance a proven and effective treatment. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the results of a June 2018 year-long investigation by [[National Public Radio]] which cast further doubt on the veracity of claims by the company.&lt;ref name = NPR&gt;{{cite web |last1=Benderev |first1=Chris | name-list-format = vanc |title='Cutting Edge' Program For Children With Autism And ADHD Rests On Razor-Thin Evidence |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/06/18/616805015/cutting-edge-program-for-children-with-autism-and-adhd-rests-on-razor-thin-evide |work = All Things Considered | publisher = National Public Radio | date = 18 June 2018 |access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brain Balance program was developed by Robert Melillo, a New York-based [[chiropractor]] who later added what he calls "functional neurology" to his practice. He began developing the business and its learning centers in 2006, opting for a [[franchising]] model. The first center opened in 2007. By early 2018 there were 110 centers in the chain and the business had an annual revenue of $41 million.&lt;ref name = Bloomberg&gt;{{cite web | last = Lawrence | first = Dune | name-list-format = vanc | date = 5 February 2018 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-02-05/how-much-would-you-pay-to-cure-your-kid-s-learning-disability | title = How Much Would You Pay to Cure Your Kid's Learning Disability? | work =[[Bloomberg Business Week]] | access-date = 16 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2985">The '''coherent potential approximation''' (or '''CPA''') is a method, in [[physics]], of finding the [[Green's function]] of an effective medium. It is a useful concept in understanding how [[sound waves]] scatter in a material which displays spatial inhomogeneity.

One version of the CPA is an extension to random materials of the [[muffin-tin approximation]], used to calculate [[electronic band structure]] in solids. A variational implementation of the muffin-tin approximation to crystalline solids using [[Green's function]]s was suggested by [[Jan Korringa|Korringa]] and by [[Walter Kohn|Kohn]] and Rostoker, and is often referred to as the [[KKR method]].&lt;ref name=Galsin&gt;

A '''crescograph''' is a device for measuring the growth in [[plants]]. It was invented in the early 20th century by Sir [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]].

The Bose crescograph uses a series of clockwork gears and a [[smoked glass]] plate to record the movement of the tip of a plant (or its roots) at magnifications of up to 10,000. Marks are made on the plate at intervals of a few seconds, demonstrating how the rate of growth varies under varying stimuli. Bose experimented with temperature, chemicals, gases, and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jagadis Bose Research on Measurement of Plant Growth (reproductions of Bose Research Institute books from the Hanscom AFB Geophysical Research Library)|url=http://www.edsanders.com/bose|accessdate=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electronic crescograph plant movement detector is capable of measurements as small as 1/1,000,000 of an inch. However, its normal operating range is from 1/1000 to 1/10,000 of an inch. The component which actually measures the movement is a differential transformer along with a movable core hinged between two points. A [[micrometer]] is used to adjust and calibrate the system. It could record plant growth, magnifying a small movement as much as 10,000,000 times.

'''Cross-cultural psychiatry''' (also known as '''transcultural psychiatry''' or '''cultural psychiatry''') is a branch of [[psychiatry]] concerned with the [[cultural]] context of [[mental disorder]]s and the challenges of addressing [[ethnic]] diversity in psychiatric services. It emerged as a coherent field from several strands of work, including surveys of the [[prevalence]] and form of disorders in different cultures or countries; the study of [[immigrant|migrant]] populations and ethnic diversity within countries; and analysis of psychiatry itself as a cultural product.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirmayer LJ|chapter=Cultural psychiatry in historical perspective|editor1=Bhui, Kamaldeep|editor2=Bhugra, Dinesh|title=Textbook of cultural psychiatry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|year=2007|pages= 3–19|isbn=0-521-85653-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early literature was associated with [[colonialism]] and with observations by asylum psychiatrists or anthropologists who tended to assume the universal applicability of Western psychiatric diagnostic categories. A seminal paper by [[Arthur Kleinman]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0037-7856(77)90138-X|author=Kleinman AM|title=Depression, somatization and the "new cross-cultural psychiatry"|journal=Soc Sci Med|volume=11|issue=1|pages=3–10|date=January 1977|pmid=887955}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a renewed dialogue between [[anthropology]] and psychiatry, is seen as having heralded a "new cross-cultural psychiatry". However, Kleinman later pointed out that culture often became incorporated in only superficial ways, and that for example 90% of DSM-IV categories are culture-bound to North America and Western Europe, and yet the "[[culture-bound syndrome]]" label is only applied to "exotic" conditions outside Euro-American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3109/10673229709030563|author=Kleinman A|title=Triumph or pyrrhic victory? The inclusion of culture in DSM-IV|journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry|volume=4|issue=6|pages=343–4|year=1997|pmid=9385013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Cultural psychiatry looks at whether psychiatric classifications of disorders are appropriate to different cultures or ethnic groups. It often argues that psychiatric illnesses represent social constructs as well as genuine medical conditions, and as such have social uses peculiar to the social groups in which they are created and legitimized. It studies psychiatric classifications in different cultures, whether informal (e.g. category terms used in different languages) or formal (for example the World Health Organization's [[ICD]], the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], or the [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]]'s [[CCMD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70238-0|author=Lee S|title=From diversity to unity. The classification of mental disorders in 21st-century China|journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America|volume=24|issue=3|pages=421–31|date=September 2001|pmid=11593854}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The field has increasingly had to address the process of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1363461506061761|author=Kirmayer LJ|title=Beyond the 'new cross-cultural psychiatry': cultural biology, discursive psychology and the ironies of globalization|journal=Transcult Psychiatry|volume=43|issue=1|pages=126–44|date=March 2006|pmid=16671396 |url=http://tps.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said every city has a different culture and that the urban environment, and how people adapt or struggle to adapt to it, can play a crucial role in the onset or worsening of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70249-5|vauthors=Caracci G, Mezzich JE|title=Culture and urban mental health|journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America|volume=24|issue=3|pages=581–93|date=September 2001|pmid=11593865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some scholars developing an anthropology of mental illness (Lézé, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;* Lézé, Samuel (2014) "[https://www.academia.edu/3581444/Anthropology_of_mental_illness Anthropology of mental illness]", in : Andrew Scull (ed.), ''Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness : an A-to-Z Guide'', Sage, pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; consider that attention to culture is not enough if it is decontextualized from historical events, and history in more general sense. An historical and politically informed perspective can counteract some of the risks related to promoting universalized 'global mental health' programs as well as the increasing hegemony of diagnostic categories such as PTSD (Didier Fassin and Richard Rechtman analyze this issue in their book 'The Empire of Trauma').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fassin|first1=Didier|last2=Rechtman|first2=Richard|title=The Empire of Trauma: An Inquiry into the Condition of Victimhood|year=2009|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691137537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto Beneduce, who devoted many years to research and clinical practice in West Africa (Mali, among the Dogon) and in Italy with migrants, strongly emphasizes this shift. Inspired by the thought of [[Frantz Fanon]], Beneduce points to forms of historical consciousness and selfhood as well as history-related suffering as central dimensions of a 'critical ethnopsychiatry' or 'critical transcultural psychiatry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beneduce|first=Roberto|title=Etnopsichiatria. Sofferenza mentale e alterità fra Storia, dominio e cultura|year=2007|publisher=Carocci|location=Rome|isbn=8843035037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beneduce|first=Roberto|title=Archeologie del Trauma.

==History==
As a named field within the larger discipline of psychiatry, cultural psychiatry has a relatively short history.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 1955, a program in transcultural psychiatry was established at McGill University in Montreal by Eric Wittkower from psychiatry and Jacob Fried from the department of anthropology. In 1957, at the International Psychiatric Congress in Zurich, Wittkower organized a meeting that was attended by psychiatrists from 20 countries, including many who became major contributors to the field of cultural psychiatry: Tsung-Yi Lin (Taiwan), Thomas Lambo (Nigeria), Morris Carstairs (Britain), Carlos Alberto Seguin (Peru) and Pow-Meng Yap (Hong Kong). The American Psychiatric Association established a Committee on Transcultural Psychiatry in 1964, followed by the Canadian Psychiatric Association in 1967. H.B.M. Murphy of McGill founded the [[World Psychiatric Association Section on Transcultural Psychiatry]] in 1970. By the mid-1970s there were active transcultural psychiatry societies in England, France, Italy and Cuba. There are several scientific journals devoted to cross-cultural issues: ''[[Transcultural Psychiatry]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.sagepub.com/|title=Transcultural Psychiatry: SAGE Journals|website=tps.sagepub.com|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (est. 1956, originally as ''Transcultural Psychiatric Research Review'', and now the official journal of the WPA Section on Transcultural Psychiatry), ''Psychopathologie Africaine'' (1965), ''Culture Medicine &amp; Psychiatry'' (1977), ''Curare'' (1978), and ''World Cultural Psychiatry Research Review'' (2006). [[The Foundation for Psychocultural Research|The Foundation for Psychocultural Research at UCLA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefpr.org|title=FPR|website=FPR|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; has published an important volume on psychocultural aspects of trauma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521854288|editor1=Kirmayer, Laurence J.|editor2=Lemelson, Robert|editor3=Barad, Mark|title=Understanding Trauma|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=0-5218-5428-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently the landmark volumes entitled ''Formative Experiences: the Interaction of Caregiving, Culture, and Developmental Psychobiology'' edited by Carol Worthman, Paul Plotsky, Daniel Schechter and Constance Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521895033|editor1=Worthman, Carol|editor2=Plotsky, Paul|editor3=Schechter, Daniel|editor4=Cummings, Constance|title=Formative Experiences|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521854283}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Re-Visioning Psychiatry: Cultural Phenomenology, Critical Neuroscience, and Global Mental Health'' edited by Laurence J. Kirmayer, Robert Lemelson and Constance Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9781316382813|editor1=Kirmayer, Laurence J.|editor2=Lemelson, Robert|editor3=Cummings, Constance|title=Re-Visioning Psychiatry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781316382813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that a cultural perspective can help psychiatrists become aware of the hidden assumptions and limitations of current psychiatric theory and practice and can identify new approaches appropriate for treating the increasingly diverse populations seen in psychiatric services around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kirmayer LJ, Minas H|title=The future of cultural psychiatry: an international perspective|journal=Can J Psychiatry|volume=45|issue=5|pages=438–46|date=June 2000|pmid=10900523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent revision of the nosology of the [[American Psychiatric Association]], [[DSM-5]], includes a Cultural Formulation Interview that aims to help clinicians contextualize diagnostic assessment. A related approach to cultural assessment involves cultural consultation which works with interpreters and cultural brokers to develop a cultural formulation and treatment plan that can assist clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirmayer|first1=Laurence|last2=Guzder|first2=Jaswant|last3=Rousseau|first3=Cécile|title=Cultural Consultation: Encountering the Other in Mental Health Care|year=2014|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-7614-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
The main professional organizations devoted to the field are the WPA Section on Transcultural Psychiatry, the [[Society for the Study of Psychiatry and Culture]], and the [[World Association for Cultural Psychiatry]]. Many other mental health organizations have interest groups or sections devoted to issues of culture and mental health.

There are active research and training programs in cultural psychiatry at several academic centers around the world, notably the Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry at [[McGill University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/tcpsych|title=Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry|publisher=[[McGill University]]|website=www.mcgill.ca|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Toronto]], and [[University College London]]. Other organizations are devoted to cross-cultural adaptation of research and clinical methods. In 1993 the Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) was founded. The TPO has developed a system of intervention aimed at countries with little or no mental health care. They train local people to become mental health workers, often using people who previously have provided mental health guidance of some kind. The TPO provides training material that is adapted to local culture, language and distinct traumatic events that might have occurred in the region where the organization is operating. Avoiding Western approaches to mental health, the TPO sets up what becomes a local non-governmental organization that is self-sustainable, as well as economically and politically independent of any state. The TPO projects have been successful in both Uganda and Cambodia.

'''datasets.load''' is an R package and RStudio plugin, that provides a both [[Graphical User Interface]] (GUI) as well as a [[Command Line Interface]] for loading datasets. Normally, R only makes datasets of loaded packages visible, '''datasets.load''' shows the list of all installed datasets on the local library, including datasets included with packages that haven't been loaded.

== R datasets ==
R functionality is extendible using extensions call R packages. The central place to store package is the Central R Archive network (CRAN). From CRAN, R packages can be installed using the command:
 install.packages()
Once installed, R packages can be loaded using the command:
 library()
After a package has been loaded, objects available from the package - such as functions and datasets - can be accessed.

The available datasets can listed using the command:
 data()
However, datasets from packages that are not loaded, are not listed. As a result, many R users have access to datasets on their local install that are never used. The '''datasets.load''' packages addresses this by listed all datasets that are in any packages installed (loaded or not loaded).

== Usage ==
The usage of '''datasets.load''''s [[Command Line Interface]] is demonstrated in the code snippet below.

&lt;source lang="rsplus"&gt;
&gt; # install the datasets.load package
&gt; install.packages('datasets.load')

&gt; # load the datasets.load package
&gt; library(datasets.load)

&gt; # list the objects in the package (all functions)
&gt; ls("package:datasets.load")
[1] "alldata"        "browseDatasets" "datasets"       "datasets.load"  "getDatasetInfo" "printDatasets" 
[7] "promptDatasets"

&gt; # show all datasets (in a new window)
&gt; datasets()
&lt;/source&gt;

A video demonstrating the GUI usage is available on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl_bYlDLydI YouTube].

== Functionality ==
The basic functionality of '''datasets.load''' is to expose all installed datasets to the user, including those in packages that are not loaded. There is a [[Command Line Interface]] which can be user from any R terminal.

In addition to this, there is also a [[Graphical User Interface]] for the RStudio [[Integrated Development Environment]], using [[RStudio#Addins|RStudio Addins]].

== Reception ==
The initial release of version 0.1.0 took place in December 2016, and averaged a download rate of 1,000 times per month, from the RStudio servers alone. With the release of version 0.3.0 in 2018, the download rate increased to 2,000 times per month, putting the package in the 9th percentile of most popular R packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/bquast/datasets.load/releases/tag/0.3.0|title=bquast/datasets.load|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The package was reviewed in the 2017 article "R Packages worth a look" on Data Analytics &amp; R&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://advanceddataanalytics.net/2017/01/05/r-packages-worth-a-look-667/|title=R Packages worth a look|date=2017-01-05|work=Data Analytics &amp; R|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which further increased usage. It is also frequently preinstalled on university computers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.carleton.edu/display/itskb/R+packages+installed|title=R packages installed - ITS - Carlpedia - Carleton College Wiki|website=wiki.carleton.edu|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in order to help make R more accessible to students. 

The RStudio CRAN mirror download logs
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RStudio CRAN logs|url=http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that the package is downloaded on average about 2000 times per month from those servers
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRANlogs datasets.load package|url=https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/datasets.load}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with a total of over 30,000 downloads since the first release
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRANlogs datasets.load package|url=https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/datasets.load}}&lt;/ref&gt;, according to RDocumentation.org, this puts the package in the 9th percentile of most popular R packages

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5418">A '''deliberatorium''' or '''collaboratorium''' is a form of online collaborative [[argument mapping]]. It was first deployed as the [[MIT]] Collaboratorium, and directed at the question of [[climate change]]. 

==History==

In December 2008,  Center for Collective Intelligence at the [[MIT]] Mark Klein tested a prototype of the collaboratorium at the [[University of Naples]] featuring a 200 student debate on biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bringing order to online discussions about climate change |url=http://blogs.nature.com/boston/2008/04/10/bringing-order-to-online-discussions-about-climate-change |website=Nature.com |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Features==

Deleiberatoriums work by deploying a website which allows the public to post the latest scientific results about climate change. Once done, people can debate how to get rid of carbon emissions which is how politicians get feedback on public opinion.  

The site operates similar to [[Wikipedia]] for authoritative reports but with a more structured, organized debate featuring an argument tree. These reports for the site come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

'''Earthquake engineering''' is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with [[earthquake]]s in mind. Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels.&lt;ref name=Bozorgnia2004&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to [[seismic loading]]; it is considered as a subset of [[structural engineering]], [[geotechnical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[applied physics]], etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and from the [[social sciences]], especially [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[finance]].

The main objectives of earthquake engineering are:
* Foresee the potential consequences of strong [[earthquakes]] on [[urban areas]] and civil infrastructure.
* Design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with [[building code]]s.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignCodes&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design Codes and Procedures|author=Berg, Glen V.|year=1983|publisher=EERI|isbn=0-943198-25-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Earthquake engineering structures|properly engineered structure]] does not necessarily have to be extremely strong or expensive. It has to be properly designed to withstand the seismic effects while sustaining an acceptable level of damage.

{{main article|Seismic loading}}

'''Seismic loading''' means application of an earthquake-generated excitation on a structure (or geo-structure). It happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.geoengineer.org/|title=Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering|website=earthquake.geoengineer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with adjacent structures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/2006/200608.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030041059/http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/2006/200608.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with [[gravity wave]]s from [[tsunami]]. The loading that is expected at a given location on the Earth's surface is estimated by engineering [[seismology]]. It is related to the [[seismic hazard]] of the location.

== Seismic performance ==
{{Main article|Seismic analysis}}

'''Earthquake''' or '''seismic performance''' defines a structure's ability to sustain its main functions, such as its [[safety]] and [[Serviceability (structure)|serviceability]], ''at'' and ''after'' a particular earthquake exposure. A structure is normally considered ''safe'' if it does not endanger the lives and [[well-being]] of those in or around it by partially or completely collapsing. A structure may be considered ''serviceable'' if it is able to fulfill its operational functions for which it was designed.

Basic concepts of the earthquake engineering, implemented in the major building codes, assume that a building should survive a rare, very severe earthquake by sustaining significant damage but without globally collapsing.&lt;ref name=RecommendedLateralForce&gt;{{cite book|title= Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary|author=Seismology Committee|year=1999|publisher= Structural Engineers Association of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it should remain operational for more frequent, but less severe seismic events.

=== Seismic performance assessment ===

Engineers need to know the quantified level of the actual or anticipated seismic performance associated with the direct damage to an individual building subject to a specified ground shaking.
Such an assessment may be performed either experimentally or analytically.

==== Experimental assessment ====
Experimental evaluations are expensive tests that are typically done by placing a (scaled) model of the structure on a [[earthquake shaking table|shake-table]] that simulates the earth shaking and observing its behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc652Zp5qWk&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=182 |title=Shaking Table Test on Conventional Wooden House (1) |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such kinds of experiments were first performed more than a century ago.&lt;ref name=SeismicExperiments&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Experiments on the Fracturing and Overturning of Columns|author=Omori, F.|year=1900|publisher=Publ. Earthquake Invest. Comm. In Foreign Languages, N.4, Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only recently has it become possible to perform 1:1 scale testing on full structures.

Due to the costly nature of such tests, they tend to be used mainly for understanding the seismic behavior of structures, validating models and verifying analysis methods. Thus, once properly validated, computational models and numerical procedures tend to carry the major burden for the seismic performance assessment of structures.

==== Analytical/Numerical assessment ====
[[File:Shaking NDC.jpg|thumb|left|Snapshot from [[shake-table video]] of a 6-story non-ductile concrete building [[destructive testing]]]]

'''Seismic performance assessment''' or [[seismic analysis|seismic structural analysis]] is a powerful tool of earthquake engineering which utilizes detailed modelling of the structure together with methods of structural analysis to gain a better understanding of seismic performance of building and [[non-building structure]]s. The technique as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.

In general, seismic structural analysis is based on the methods of [[structural dynamics]].&lt;ref name=DynamicsOfStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Dynamics of Structures|author=Chopra, Anil K.|year=1995|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-855214-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, the most prominent instrument of seismic analysis has been the earthquake [[response spectrum]] method which also contributed to the proposed building code's concept of today.&lt;ref name=EarthquakeSpectra&gt;{{cite book|title= Earthquake Spectra and Design|author1=Newmark, N.M. |author2=Hall, W.J. |year=1982|publisher=[[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute|EERI]]|isbn=0-943198-22-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such methods are good only for linear elastic systems, being largely unable to model the structural behavior when damage (i.e., [[non-linearity]]) appears. Numerical ''step-by-step integration'' proved to be a more effective method of analysis for multi-degree-of-freedom [[structural system]]s with significant [[non-linearity]] under a [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] process of ground motion excitation.&lt;ref name=DynamicsofStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Dynamics of Structures|author1=Clough, Ray W. |author2=Penzien, Joseph |year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-011394-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically, numerical analysis is conducted in order to evaluate the seismic performance of buildings. Performance evaluations are generally carried out by using nonlinear static pushover analysis or  nonlinear time-history analysis. In such analyses, it is essential to achieve accurate non-linear modeling of structural components such as beams, columns, beam-column joints, shear walls etc. Thus, experimental results play an important role in determining the modeling parameters of individual components, especially those that are subject to significant non-linear deformations. The individual components are then assembled to create a full non-linear model of the structure. Thus created models are analyzed to evaluate the performance of buildings.

The capabilities of the structural analysis software are a major consideration in the above process as they restrict the possible component models, the analysis methods available and, most importantly, the numerical robustness. The latter becomes a major consideration for structures that venture into the non-linear range and approach global or local collapse as the numerical solution becomes increasingly unstable and thus difficult to reach. There are several commercially available Finite Element Analysis software's such as CSI-SAP2000 and CSI-PERFORM-3D and Scia Engineer-ECtools which can be used for the seismic performance evaluation of buildings. Moreover, there is research-based finite element analysis platforms such as [[OpenSees]], RUAUMOKO and the older DRAIN-2D/3D, several of which are now open source.

== Research for earthquake engineering ==
[[File:FPB testing-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Earthquake shaking table|Shake-table]] testing of [[Earthquake engineering#Friction pendulum bearing|Friction Pendulum Bearings]] at EERC]]

Research for earthquake engineering means both field and analytical investigation or experimentation intended for discovery and scientific explanation of earthquake engineering related facts, revision of conventional concepts in the light of new findings, and practical application of the developed theories.

The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) is the main United States government agency that supports fundamental research and education in all fields of earthquake engineering. In particular, it focuses on experimental, analytical and computational research on design and performance enhancement of structural systems.[[File:E-Defense Shake Table.jpg|thumb|E-Defense Shake Table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-mEDsqZK-I&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=660C7AFD70E81C12&amp;index=71 |title=Miki_house_test |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute]] (EERI) is a leader in dissemination of [[earthquake engineering research]] related information both in the U.S. and globally.

A definitive list of earthquake engineering research related [[Earthquake shaking table|shaking tables]] around the world may be found in Experimental Facilities for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nea.fr/html/nsd/docs/2004/csni-r2004-10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The most prominent of them is now E-Defense Shake Table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bosai.go.jp/hyogo/ehyogo/|title=The NIED ‘E-Defence’ Laboratory in Miki City]|accessdate=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Japan]].{{clear}}

[[File:Seismic Testing of Crane.jpg|thumb|left|NEES at [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|Buffalo]] testing facility]]

The equipment sites (labs) and a central data repository are connected to the global earthquake engineering community via the NEEShub website.  The NEES website is powered by HUBzero software developed at [[Purdue University]] for [[nanoHUB]] specifically to help the scientific community share resources and collaborate.  The cyberinfrastructure, connected via [[Internet2]], provides interactive simulation tools, a simulation tool development area, a curated central data repository, animated presentations, user support, telepresence, mechanism for uploading and sharing resources, and statistics about users and usage patterns.

This cyberinfrastructure allows researchers to: securely store, organize and share data within a standardized framework in a central location; remotely observe and participate in experiments through the use of synchronized real-time data and video; collaborate with colleagues to facilitate the planning, performance, analysis, and publication of research experiments; and conduct computational and hybrid simulations that may combine the results of multiple distributed experiments and link physical experiments with computer simulations to enable the investigation of overall system performance.

These resources jointly provide the means for collaboration and discovery to improve the seismic design and performance of civil and mechanical infrastructure systems.

=== Earthquake simulation ===

The very first '''earthquake simulations''' were performed by statically applying some ''horizontal inertia forces'' based on [[scale factor|scaled]] [[peak ground acceleration]]s to a mathematical model of a building.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignOfBuildingStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design of Building Structures|author1=Lindeburg, Michael R. |author2=Baradar, Majid |year=2001|publisher=Professional Publications|isbn=1-888577-52-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the further development of computational technologies, [[statics|static]] approaches began to give way to [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] ones.

Dynamic experiments on building and non-building structures may be physical, like [[Earthquake shaking table|shake-table testing]], or virtual ones. In both cases, to verify a structure's expected seismic performance, some researchers prefer to deal with so called "real time-histories" though the last cannot be "real" for a hypothetical earthquake specified by either a building code or by some particular research requirements. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to engage an earthquake simulation which is the seismic input that possesses only essential features of a real event.

Sometimes earthquake simulation is understood as a re-creation of local effects of a strong earth shaking.

=== Structure simulation ===
[[File:Kinematically equivalent building models on a shake-table.jpg|thumb|Concurrent experiments with two building models which are ''kinematically equivalent'' to a real prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvD5D2uhliM |title=Base isolation for earthquake engineering |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Theoretical or experimental evaluation of anticipated seismic performance mostly requires a '''structure simulation''' which is based on the concept of structural likeness or similarity. [[Similitude (model)|Similarity]] is some degree of [[analogy]] or [[Nominalism|resemblance]] between two or more objects. The notion of similarity rests either on exact or approximate repetitions of [[patterns]] in the compared items.

In general, a building model is said to have similarity with the real object if the two share ''geometric similarity'', ''kinematic similarity'' and ''dynamic similarity''. The most vivid and effective type of similarity is the ''kinematic'' one. ''Kinematic similarity'' exists when the paths and velocities of moving particles of a model and its prototype are similar.

The ultimate level of ''kinematic similarity'' is ''kinematic equivalence'' when, in the case of earthquake engineering, time-histories of each story lateral displacements of the model and its prototype would be the same.

== Seismic vibration control ==

'''Seismic vibration control''' is a set of technical means aimed to mitigate seismic impacts in building and [[non-building]] structures. All seismic vibration control  devices may be classified as ''passive'', ''active'' or ''hybrid''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics-animations.com/Physics/English/spri_txt.htm |title=Passive and active vibration isolation systems – Theory |publisher=Physics-animations.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; where:

* ''passive control devices'' have no [[feedback]] capability between them, structural elements and the ground;
* ''[[Active vibration control|active control devices]]'' incorporate real-time recording instrumentation on the ground integrated with earthquake input processing equipment and [[actuator]]s within the structure;
* ''hybrid control devices'' have combined features of active and passive control systems.&lt;ref name=ActiveHybrid&gt;{{cite book|title= Active, Hybrid and Semi-Active Structural Control|author1=Chu, S.Y. |author2=Soong, T.T. |author3=Reinhorn, A.M. |year=2005|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0-470-01352-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ground [[seismic waves]] reach up and start to penetrate a base of a building, their energy flow density, due to reflections, reduces dramatically: usually, up to 90%. However, the remaining portions of the incident waves during a major earthquake still bear a huge devastating potential.

After the seismic waves enter a [[superstructure]], there are a number of ways to control them in order to soothe their damaging effect and improve the building's seismic performance, for instance:

* to [[Dissipator (building design)|dissipate]] the wave energy inside a [[superstructure]] with properly engineered [[damper (mast)|damper]]s;
* to disperse the wave energy between a wider range of frequencies;
* to [[absorption (acoustics)|absorb]] the [[resonant]] portions of the whole wave frequencies band with the help of so-called ''[[mass damper]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/211_fall2002.web.dir/Eva_Burk/Eva's%201st%20page.htm |title=Slide 2 |publisher=Ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cyrus tomb.jpg|thumb|[[Mausoleum]] of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], the oldest [[base isolation|base-isolated]] structure in the world]]
Devices of the last kind, abbreviated correspondingly as TMD for the tuned (''passive''), as AMD for the ''active'', and as HMD for the ''hybrid mass dampers'', have been studied and installed in [[high-rise building]]s, predominantly in Japan, for a quarter of a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takenaka.co.jp/takenaka_e/quake_e/seishin/seishin.htm|title=想いをかたちに 未来へつなぐ　竹中工務店|website=www.takenaka.co.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is quite another approach: partial suppression of the seismic energy flow into the [[superstructure]] known as seismic or [[base isolation]].

For this, some pads are inserted into or under all major load-carrying elements in the base of the building which should substantially decouple a [[superstructure]] from its [[Substructure (engineering)|substructure]] resting on a shaking ground.

The first evidence of earthquake protection by using the principle of base isolation was discovered in [[Pasargadae]], a city in ancient Persia, now Iran, and dates back to the 6th century BCE. Below, there are some samples of seismic vibration control technologies of today.

=== Dry-stone walls control ===
[[File:Machupicchu intihuatana.JPG|thumb|left|Dry-stone walls of [[Machu Picchu]] Temple of the Sun, [[Peru]]]]People of [[Inca civilization]] were masters of the polished 'dry-stone walls', called [[ashlar]], where blocks of stone were cut to fit together tightly without any [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. The Incas were among the best stonemasons the world has ever seen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/inca1/qanda.html |title=Live Event Q&amp;As |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many junctions in their masonry were so perfect that even blades of grass could not fit between the stones.

[[Peru]] is a highly [[seismic]] land and for centuries the mortar-free [[construction]] proved to be apparently more earthquake-resistant than using mortar. The stones of the dry-stone walls built by the Incas could move slightly and resettle without the walls collapsing, a passive [[vibration control|structural control]] technique employing both the principle of energy dissipation (coulomb damping) and that of suppressing [[resonant]] amplifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/civilization/first.html |title=Clark, Liesl; "First Inhabitants"; PBS online, Nova; updated Nov. 2000 |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the [[tuned mass damper]]s are huge concrete blocks mounted in [[skyscraper]]s or other structures and move in opposition to the [[resonance frequency]] oscillations of the structures by means of some sort of spring mechanism.

The [[Taipei 101]] skyscraper needs to withstand [[typhoon]] winds and earthquake [[tremor]]s common in this area of Asia/Pacific. For this purpose, a steel [[pendulum]] weighing 660 metric tonnes that serves as a tuned mass damper was designed and installed atop the structure. Suspended from the 92nd to the 88th floor, the pendulum sways to decrease resonant amplifications of lateral displacements in the building caused by earthquakes and strong [[Wind|gusts]].

=== Hysteretic dampers ===
A '''hysteretic damper''' is intended to provide better and more reliable seismic performance than that of a conventional structure by increasing the dissipation of [[seismic loading|seismic input]] energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.structuremag.org/OldArchives/2004/july/Structural%20Practices.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514012858/http://www.structuremag.org/OldArchives/2004/july/Structural%20Practices.pdf |date=May 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are five major groups of hysteretic dampers used for the purpose, namely:

:* '''Fluid viscous dampers (FVDs)'''
Viscous Dampers have the benefit of being a supplemental damping system. They have an oval hysteretic loop and the damping is velocity dependent. While some minor maintenance is potentially required, viscous dampers generally do not need to be replaced after an earthquake. While more expensive than other damping technologies they can be used for both seismic and wind loads and are the most commonly used hysteretic damper.

:* '''Friction dampers (FDs)'''
Friction dampers tend to be available in two major types, linear and rotational and dissipate energy by heat. The damper operates on the principle of a [[Coulomb damping|coulomb damper]]. Depending on the design, friction dampers can experience [[stick-slip phenomenon]] and [[Cold welding]]. The main disadvantage being that friction surfaces can wear over time and for this reason they are not recommended for dissipating wind loads. When used in seismic applications wear is not a problem and there is no required maintenance. They have a rectangular hysteretic loop and as long as the building is sufficiently elastic they tend to settle back to their original positions after an earthquake.

:* '''Metallic yielding dampers (MYDs)'''
Metallic yielding dampers, as the name implies, yield in order to absorb the earthquake's energy. This type of damper absorbs a large amount of energy however they must be replaced after an earthquake and may prevent the building from settling back to its original position.

:* '''Viscoelastic dampers (VEDs)'''
Viscoelastic dampers are useful in that they can be used for both wind and seismic applications, they are usually limited to small displacements. There is some concern as to the reliability of the technology as some brands have been banned from use in buildings in the United States.

:* '''Straddling pendulum dampers (swing)'''

=== Base isolation ===
Base isolation seeks to prevent the kinetic energy of the earthquake from being transferred into elastic energy in the building. These technologies do so by isolating the structure from the ground, thus enabling them to move somewhat independently. The degree to which the energy is transferred into the structure and how the energy is dissipated will vary depending on the technology used.

:* '''Lead rubber bearing'''
[[File:LRBtest.jpg|thumb|LRB being tested at the [[UCSD]] Caltrans-SRMD facility]]

Lead rubber bearing or LRB is a type of [[base isolation]] employing a heavy [[damping]].  It was invented by [[William Robinson (scientist)|Bill Robinson]], a New Zealander.&lt;ref name="teara.govt.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/earthquakes/4 |title=4. Building for earthquake resistance – Earthquakes – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy damping mechanism incorporated in [[vibration control]] technologies and, particularly, in base isolation devices, is often considered a valuable source of suppressing vibrations thus enhancing a building's seismic performance. However, for the rather pliant systems such as base isolated structures, with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping, the so-called "damping force" may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake.  The video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yXgu4aS8HE |title=LBRtest |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a Lead Rubber Bearing being tested at the [[UCSD]] Caltrans-SRMD facility. The bearing is made of rubber with a lead core. It was a uniaxial test in which the bearing was also under a full structure load. Many buildings and bridges, both in New Zealand and elsewhere, are protected with lead dampers and lead and rubber bearings. [[Te Papa Tongarewa]], the national museum of New Zealand, and the New Zealand [[The Beehive|Parliament Buildings]] have been fitted with the bearings. Both are in [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] which sits on an [[active fault]].&lt;ref name="teara.govt.nz"/&gt;

:* '''Springs-with-damper base isolator'''
[[File:GERB spring with damper.jpg|thumb|Springs-with-damper close-up]]

Springs-with-damper base isolator installed under a three-story town-house, [[Santa Monica]], California is shown on the photo taken prior to the 1994 [[Northridge earthquake]] exposure. It is a [[base isolation]] device conceptually similar to ''Lead Rubber Bearing''.

One of two three-story town-houses like this, which was well instrumented for recording of both vertical and horizontal [[acceleration]]s on its floors and the ground, has survived a severe shaking during the [[Northridge earthquake]] and left  valuable recorded information for further study.

:* '''Simple roller bearing'''
Simple roller bearing is a [[base isolation]] device which is intended for protection of various building and non-building structures against potentially damaging [[seismic loading|lateral impacts]] of strong earthquakes.

This metallic bearing support may be adapted, with certain precautions, as a seismic isolator to skyscrapers and buildings on soft ground. Recently, it has been employed under the name of ''[[metallic roller bearing]]'' for a housing complex (17 stories) in [[Tokyo, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okumuragumi.co.jp/en/technology/building.html |title=Building Technology + Seismic Isolation System – Okumura Corporation |language=ja |publisher=Okumuragumi.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '''Friction pendulum bearing'''

Friction pendulum bearing (FPB) is another name of '''friction pendulum system''' (FPS). It is based on three pillars:&lt;ref name=FPS&gt;{{Citation |title=A Simple Pendulum Technique for Achieving Seismic Isolation |last1=Zayas |first1=Victor A. |last2=Low |first2=Stanley S. |last3=Mahin |first3=Stephen A. | author3-link=Stephen A.

== Seismic design ==

'''Seismic design''' is based on authorized engineering procedures, principles and criteria meant to [[design]] or [[seismic retrofit|retrofit]] structures subject to earthquake exposure.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignOfBuildingStructures/&gt; Those criteria are only consistent with the contemporary state of the knowledge about [[earthquake engineering structures]].&lt;ref name=EarthquakeDesignCriteria&gt;{{cite book|title= Earthquake Design Criteria|author1=Housner, George W. |author2=Jennings, Paul C. |year=1982|publisher=EERI|isbn=1-888577-52-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a building design which exactly follows seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/bertero/html/earthquake-resistant_construction.html |title=Earthquake-Resistant Construction |publisher=Nisee.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915091405/http://nisee.berkeley.edu/bertero/html/earthquake-resistant_construction.html |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of poor seismic design may be enormous. Nevertheless, seismic design has always been a [[trial and error]] process whether it was based on physical laws or on empirical knowledge of the [[seismic performance|structural performance]] of different shapes and materials.

[[File:San Francisco in ruins view from Captive Airship above Folsom 1906.jpg|thumb|[[San Francisco]] after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] and fire]]
To practice [[seismic design]], seismic analysis or seismic evaluation of new and existing civil engineering projects, an [[engineer]] should, normally, pass examination on ''Seismic Principles''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pels.ca.gov/applicants/plan_civseism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which, in the State of California, include:
* Seismic Data and Seismic Design Criteria
* Seismic Characteristics of Engineered Systems
* Seismic Forces
* Seismic Analysis Procedures
* Seismic Detailing and Construction Quality Control

To build up complex structural systems,&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignHandbook&gt;{{cite book|title=Seismic Design Handbook|author=Edited by Farzad Naeim|year=1989|publisher=VNR|isbn=0-442-26922-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; seismic design largely uses the same relatively small number of basic structural elements (to say nothing of vibration control devices) as any non-seismic design project.

Normally, according to building codes, structures are designed to "withstand" the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings.

Seismic design is carried out by understanding the possible [[failure mode]]s of a structure and providing the structure with appropriate [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[stiffness]], [[ductility]], and [[configuration (geometry)|configuration]]&lt;ref name=BuildingConfiguration&gt;{{cite book|title= Building Configuration &amp; Seismic Design|author1=Arnold, Christopher |author2=Reitherman, Robert |year=1982|publisher=A Wiley-Interscience Publication|isbn=0-471-86138-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure those modes cannot occur.

=== Seismic design requirements ===
'''Seismic design requirements''' depend on the type of the structure, locality of the project and its authorities which stipulate applicable seismic design codes and criteria.&lt;ref name="RecommendedLateralForce"/&gt; For instance, [[California Department of Transportation]]'s requirements called ''The Seismic Design Criteria'' (SDC) and aimed at the design of new bridges in California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/earthquake_engineering/SDC/SDCPage.html |title=Template for External Caltrans Pages |publisher=Dot.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate an innovative seismic performance-based approach.

[[File:Metsamor aerien.jpg|thumb|The [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] was closed after the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asbarez.com/2007/12/07/strategy-to-close-metsamor-plant-presented |title=Strategy to Close Metsamor Plant Presented &amp;#124; Asbarez Armenian News |publisher=Asbarez.com |date=1995-10-26 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]The most significant feature in the SDC design philosophy is a shift from a ''force-based assessment'' of seismic demand to a ''displacement-based assessment'' of demand and capacity. Thus, the newly adopted displacement approach is based on comparing the ''elastic displacement'' demand to the ''inelastic displacement'' capacity of the primary structural components while ensuring a minimum level of inelastic capacity at all potential plastic hinge locations.

In addition to the designed structure itself, seismic design requirements may include a ''ground stabilization'' underneath the structure: sometimes, heavily shaken ground breaks up which leads to collapse of the structure sitting upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d316Wdgf16Y&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=63 |title=Niigita Earthquake 1964 – YouTube |publisher=www.youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following topics should be of primary concerns: liquefaction; dynamic lateral earth pressures on retaining walls; seismic slope stability; earthquake-induced settlement.&lt;ref name=GeoEarthquakeEngineering&gt;{{cite book|title= Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering Handbook|author=Robert W. Day|year=2007|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=0-07-137782-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear facility|Nuclear facilities]] should not jeopardise their safety in case of earthquakes or other hostile external events. Therefore, their seismic design is based on criteria far more stringent than those applying to non-nuclear facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf18.html |title=Nuclear Power Plants and Earthquakes |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] and [[2011 Japanese nuclear incidents|damage to other nuclear facilities]] that followed the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] have, however, drawn attention to ongoing concerns over [[Nuclear power in Japan#Seismicity|Japanese nuclear seismic design standards]] and caused other many governments to [[International reaction to Fukushima I nuclear accidents#Re-evaluation of existing nuclear energy programs|re-evaluate their nuclear programs]]. Doubt has also been expressed over the seismic evaluation and design of certain other plants, including the [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant]] in France.

=== Failure modes ===

'''Failure mode''' is the manner by which an earthquake induced failure is observed. It, generally, describes the way the failure occurs. Though costly and time consuming, learning from each real earthquake failure remains a routine recipe for advancement in ''seismic design'' methods. Below, some typical modes of earthquake-generated failures are presented.

[[File:LomaPrieta-SOMA.jpeg|thumb|left|Typical damage to [[unreinforced masonry building]]s at earthquakes]]
The lack of [[rebar|reinforcement]] coupled with poor [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and inadequate roof-to-wall ties can result in substantial damage to an '''unreinforced masonry building'''. Severely cracked or leaning walls are some of the most common earthquake damage. Also hazardous is the damage that may occur between the walls and roof or floor diaphragms. Separation between the framing and the walls can jeopardize the vertical support of roof and floor systems.

[[File:LomaPrieta-Marina.jpeg|thumb|[[Soft story building|Soft story]] collapse due to inadequate shear strength at ground level, [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]]]
'''[[Soft story building|Soft story effect]]'''. Absence of adequate stiffness on the ground level caused damage to this structure. A close examination of the image reveals that the rough board siding, once covered by a [[brick veneer]], has been completely dismantled from the studwall. Only the [[Structural rigidity|rigidity]] of the floor above combined with the support on the two hidden sides by continuous walls, not penetrated with large doors as on the street sides, is preventing full collapse of the structure.

[[File:Liquefaction at Niigata.JPG|thumb|left|Effects of [[soil liquefaction]] during the [[1964 Niigata earthquake]]]]
'''[[Soil liquefaction]]'''. In the cases where the soil consists of loose granular deposited materials with the tendency to develop excessive hydrostatic pore water pressure of sufficient magnitude and compact, [[liquefaction]] of those loose saturated deposits may result in non-uniform [[Consolidation (soil)|settlements]] and tilting of structures. This caused major damage to thousands of buildings in Niigata, Japan during the [[1964 Niigata earthquake|1964 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d316Wdgf16Y&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=63 |title=Niigita Earthquake 1964 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Smashed Car in Dujiangyan - 2008 Sichuan earthquake (1).jpg|thumb|Car smashed by [[landslide]] rock, [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]]]
'''Landslide rock fall'''. A [[landslide]] is a geological phenomenon which includes a wide range of ground movement, including '''rock falls'''. Typically, the action of [[gravity]] is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur though in this case there was another contributing factor which affected the original [[slope stability]]: the landslide required an ''earthquake trigger'' before being released.

[[File:St.Joseph'sSeminary Los Altos USGS.jpg|thumb|left|Effects of pounding against adjacent building, [[Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta]]]]
'''Pounding against adjacent building'''. This is a photograph of the collapsed five-story tower, St. Joseph's Seminary, [[Los Altos, California]] which resulted in one fatality. During [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], the tower pounded against the independently vibrating adjacent building behind. A possibility of pounding depends on both buildings' lateral displacements which should be accurately estimated and accounted for.

[[File:Kaiser Permanente Building After Northridge Earthquake.jpg|thumb|Effects of completely shattered joints of concrete frame, [[Northridge earthquake|Northridge]]]]
At [[Northridge earthquake]], the Kaiser Permanente concrete frame office building had joints completely shattered, revealing '''inadequate confinement steel''', which resulted in the second story collapse. In the transverse direction, composite end [[shear wall]]s, consisting of two [[wythe]]s of brick and a layer of [[shotcrete]] that carried the lateral load, peeled apart because of '''inadequate through-ties''' and failed.

* Improper [[construction site]] on a [[foothill]].
* Poor detailing of the [[rebar|reinforcement]] (lack of concrete confinement in the columns and at the beam-column joints, inadequate splice length).
* Seismically weak [[soft story building|soft story]] at the first floor.
* Long [[cantilever]]s with heavy [[dead load]].

[[File:Ground failure.jpeg|thumb|''Lateral spreading'' mode of ground failure, [[Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta]]]]
Ground shaking triggered [[soil liquefaction]] in a subsurface layer of [[sand]], producing differential lateral and vertical movement in an overlying [[carapace]] of unliquified sand and [[silt]]. This '''mode of ground failure''', termed '''lateral spreading''', is a principal cause of liquefaction-related earthquake damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlSuosOTAV0&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=660C7AFD70E81C12&amp;index=53&amp;playnext=2&amp;playnext_from=PL |title=Soil Liquefaction with Dr. Ellen Rathje |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earthquake-resistant construction ==

'''Earthquake construction''' means implementation of '''seismic design''' to enable building and non-building structures to live through the anticipated earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with the applicable [[building code]]s.[[File:2009 03 03 Pearl River Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of [[Pearl River Tower]] X-bracing to resist lateral forces of earthquakes and winds]]

Design and construction are intimately related. To achieve a good workmanship, detailing of the members and their connections should be as simple as possible. As any construction in general, earthquake construction is a process that consists of the building, retrofitting or assembling of infrastructure given the construction materials available.&lt;ref name=BridgeDesign&gt;{{cite book|title=Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance
|author=Edited by Robert Lark|year=2007|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=0-7277-3593-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destabilizing action of an earthquake on constructions may be ''direct'' (seismic motion of the ground) or ''indirect'' (earthquake-induced landslides, [[soil liquefaction]] and waves of tsunami).

A structure might have all the appearances of stability, yet offer nothing but danger when an earthquake occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24993357/ |title=Bad construction cited in quake zone – World news – Asia-Pacific – China earthquake &amp;#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crucial fact is that, for safety, earthquake-resistant construction techniques are as important as [[quality control]] and using correct materials. ''Earthquake contractor'' should be [[registered company|registered]] in the state/province/country of the project location (depending on local regulations), [[bond (finance)|bonded]] and [[insured]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.

To minimize possible [[earthquake loss|losses]], construction process should be organized with keeping in mind that earthquake may strike any time prior to the end of construction.

Each [[construction project]] requires a qualified team of professionals who understand the basic features of seismic performance of different structures as well as [[construction management]].

=== Adobe structures ===
[[File:Adobe structure.jpg|thumb|Partially collapsed adobe building in Westmorland, [[California]]]]

Around thirty percent of the world's population lives or works in earth-made construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eartharchitecture.org/|title=Earth Architecture – the Book, Synopsis|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe]] type of [[mud brick]]s is one of the oldest and most widely used building materials. The use of [[adobe]] is very common in some of the world's most hazard-prone regions, traditionally across Latin America, Africa, Indian subcontinent and other parts of Asia, Middle East and Southern Europe.

Adobe buildings are considered very vulnerable at strong quakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOiqGHEOmuA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=16 |title=simulacion terremoto peru-huaraz – casas de adobe – YouTube |publisher=Nz.youtube.com |date=2006-06-24 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple ways of seismic strengthening of new and existing adobe buildings are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-housing.net/uploads/WHETutorial_Adobe_English.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828211041/http://www.world-housing.net/uploads/WHETutorial_Adobe_English.pdf |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key factors for the improved seismic performance of
adobe construction are:
* Quality of construction.
* Compact, box-type layout.
* Seismic reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EUOPY0OjlQ&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=21 |title=Shake table testing of adobe house (4A-S7 East) – YouTube |publisher=Nz.youtube.com |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limestone and sandstone structures ===
[[File:SLCCityAndCountyBldg.jpg|thumb|left|Base-isolated City and County Building, [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]]]

[[Limestone]] is very common in architecture, especially in North America and Europe. Many landmarks across the world are made of limestone. Many medieval churches and castles in Europe are made of [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]] masonry. They are the long-lasting materials but their rather heavy weight is not beneficial for adequate seismic performance.

Application of modern technology to seismic retrofitting can enhance the survivability of unreinforced masonry structures. As an example, from 1973 to 1989, the [[Salt Lake City and County Building]] in [[Utah]] was exhaustively renovated and repaired with an emphasis on preserving historical accuracy in appearance. This was done in concert with a seismic upgrade that placed the weak sandstone structure on base isolation foundation to better protect it from earthquake damage.

=== Timber frame structures ===
[[File:Anne Hvides Gaard Svendborg.jpg|thumb|[[Anne Hvide's House]], Denmark (1560)]]

[[Timber framing]] dates back thousands of years, and has been used in many parts of the world during various periods such as ancient Japan, Europe and medieval England in localities where timber was in good supply and building stone and the skills to work it were not.

The use of [[timber framing]] in buildings provides their complete skeletal framing which offers some structural benefits as the timber frame, if properly engineered, lends itself to better ''seismic survivability''.&lt;ref name=Timber&gt;{{cite book|title= Timber Design &amp; Construction Sourcebook=Gotz, Karl-Heinz et al.|year=1989|publisher=McGraw-Hall |isbn=0-07-023851-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light-frame structures ===
[[File:Wood-framed house.jpg|thumb|left|A two-story wooden-frame for a residential building structure]]

[[Light-frame construction|Light-frame structures]] usually gain seismic resistance from rigid [[plywood]] shear walls and wood structural panel [[diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nees.buffalo.edu/projects/NEESWood/video.asp |title=SEESL |publisher=Nees.buffalo.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special provisions for seismic load-resisting systems for all [[engineered wood]] structures requires consideration of diaphragm ratios, horizontal and vertical diaphragm shears, and [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|connector]]/[[fastener]] values. In addition, collectors, or drag struts, to distribute shear along a diaphragm length are required.

=== Reinforced masonry structures ===
[[File:Bond-beam.JPG|thumb|Reinforced hollow masonry wall]]

A construction system where [[steel reinforcement]] is embedded in the [[mortar joint]]s of [[masonry]] or placed in holes and after filled with [[concrete]] or [[grout]] is called '''reinforced masonry'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rossen Rashkoff |url=http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/earthquakes/MasonryBrick/ReinforcedBrickMasonry.htm |title=Reinforced Brick Masonry |publisher=Staff.city.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819014216/http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/earthquakes/MasonryBrick/ReinforcedBrickMasonry.htm |archivedate=2013-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The devastating [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed that masonry construction should be improved immediately. Then, the California State Code made the reinforced masonry mandatory.

There are various practices and techniques to achieve reinforced masonry. The most common type is the reinforced hollow unit masonry. The effectiveness of both vertical and horizontal reinforcement strongly depends on the type and quality of the masonry, i.e. masonry units and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].

To achieve a [[ductile]] behavior of masonry, it is necessary that the [[shear strength]] of the wall is greater than the [[flexural strength]].&lt;ref name=SeismicMasonry&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design of Masonry Using the 1997 UBC|author1=Ekwueme, Chukwuma G. |author2=Uzarski, Joe |year=2003|publisher=Concrete Masonry Association of California and Nevada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reinforced concrete structures ===
[[File:StressedRibbonBridgeUnderside7138.JPG|thumb|left|Stressed Ribbon pedestrian bridge over the Rogue River, Grants Pass, [[Oregon]]]]
[[File:ThreeTwrBrCenter.jpg|thumb|left|Prestressed concrete [[cable-stayed bridge]] over [[Yangtze river]]]]

[[Reinforced concrete]] is concrete in which steel reinforcement bars ([[rebars]]) or [[fiber]]s have been incorporated to strengthen a material that would otherwise be [[brittle]]. It can be used to produce [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[column]]s, floors or bridges.

[[Prestressed concrete]] is a kind of [[reinforced concrete]] used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to [[beams]], floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing [[tendon]]s (generally of high tensile steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a [[compressive stress]] that offsets the [[tensile stress]] that the concrete [[compression member]] would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.

To prevent catastrophic collapse in response earth shaking (in the interest of life safety), a traditional reinforced concrete frame should have [[ductile]] joints. Depending upon the methods used and the imposed seismic forces, such buildings may be immediately usable, require extensive repair, or may have to be demolished.

=== Prestressed structures ===
[[Prestressed structure]] is the one whose overall [[integrity]], [[Structural stability|stability]] and [[security]] depend, primarily, on a ''prestressing''. ''Prestressing'' means the intentional creation of permanent stresses in a structure for the purpose of improving its performance under various service conditions.&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcreteDesign&gt;{{cite book|title= Design of Prestressed Concrete|author=Nilson, Arthur H.|year=1987|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-83072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman Colosseum With Moon.jpg|thumb|Naturally pre-compressed exterior wall of [[Colosseum]], Rome]]
There are the following basic types of prestressing:
* Pre-compression (mostly, with the own weight of a structure)
* [[Prestressed concrete|Pretensioning]] with high-strength embedded tendons
* [[Prestressed concrete|Post-tensioning]] with high-strength bonded or unbonded tendons
Today, the concept of [[prestressed structure]] is widely engaged in design of [[building]]s, underground structures, TV towers, power stations, floating storage and offshore facilities, [[nuclear reactor]] vessels, and numerous kinds of [[bridge]] systems.&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcrete&gt;{{cite book|title= Prestressed Concrete|author=Nawy, Edward G.|year=1989|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-698375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A beneficial idea of ''prestressing'' was, apparently, familiar to the ancient Rome architects; look, e.g., at the tall [[attic]] wall of [[Colosseum]] working as a stabilizing device for the wall [[pier]]s beneath.

=== Steel structures ===
[[File:LomaPrieta-BayBridge-collapsed-section.jpeg|thumb|Collapsed section of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] in response to [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]]]

'''Steel structures''' are considered mostly earthquake resistant but some failures have occurred. A great number of welded [[steel moment-resisting frame]] buildings, which looked earthquake-proof, surprisingly experienced brittle behavior and were hazardously damaged in the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]].&lt;ref name=Reitherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|pages=394–395|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|archivedate=2012-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) initiated development of repair techniques and new design approaches to minimize damage to steel moment frame buildings in future earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacsteel.org/index.html |title=SAC Steel Project: Welcome |publisher=Sacsteel.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[structural steel]] seismic design based on [[Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD) approach, it is very important to assess ability of a structure to develop and maintain its bearing resistance in the [[inelastic]] range. A measure of this ability is [[ductility]], which may be observed in a ''material itself'', in a ''structural element'', or to a ''whole structure''.

As a consequence of [[Northridge earthquake]] experience, the American Institute of Steel Construction has introduced AISC 358 "Pre-Qualified Connections for Special and intermediate Steel Moment Frames."  The AISC Seismic Design Provisions require that all [[Steel Moment Resisting Frame]]s employ either connections contained in AISC 358, or the use of connections that have been subjected to pre-qualifying cyclic testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seismic Design Manual|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Steel Construction|location=Chicago|isbn=1-56424-056-8|pages=6.1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prediction of earthquake losses ==

'''Earthquake loss estimation''' is usually defined as a ''Damage Ratio'' ('''DR''') which is a ratio of the earthquake damage repair cost to the [[Total Economic Value|total value]] of a building.&lt;ref name=SeismicRisk&gt;{{cite book|title= Financial Management of Earthquake Risk|author=EERI Endowment Subcommittee|date=May 2000|publisher=EERI Publication|isbn=0-943198-21-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Probable Maximum Loss'' ('''PML''') is a common term used for earthquake loss estimation, but it lacks a precise definition.  In 1999, ASTM E2026 'Standard Guide for the Estimation of Building Damageability in Earthquakes' was produced in order to standardize the nomenclature for seismic loss estimation, as well as establish guidelines as to the review process and qualifications of the reviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cccengr.com/cccengerwebpage_lossestimation.html|year=1999|title=Loss Estimation|author=Eugene Trahern|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410060435/http://www.cccengr.com/cccengerwebpage_lossestimation.html|archivedate=2009-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthquake loss estimations are also referred to as ''Seismic Risk Assessments''.  The risk assessment process generally involves determining the probability of various ground motions coupled with the vulnerability or damage of the building under those ground motions.  The results are defined as a percent of building replacement value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acceptable Risk Processes: Lifeline and Natural Hazards|year=2002|publisher=ASCE, TCLEE|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784406236|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5260|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113010823/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5260|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-13|editor1=Craig Taylor|editor2=Erik VanMarcke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the group I of the [[Baltimore classification]], ''Enterobacteria phage PsP3'' is a [[dsDNA virus]]es. All the family Myoviridae members share a nonenveloped morphology consisting of a head and a tail separated by a neck. Its [[genome]] is linear. The propagation of the virions includes the attaching to a host cell (a [[bacterium]], as ''Enterobacteria phage PsP3'' is a [[bacteriophage]]) and the injection of the double stranded DNA; the host transcribes and translates it to manufacture new particles. To replicate its genetic content requires host cell [[DNA polymerases]] and, hence, the process is highly dependent on the cell cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4329869|year=1971|last1=Baltimore|first1=D|title=Expression of animal virus genomes|volume=35|issue=3|pages=235–41|pmc=378387|journal=Bacteriological Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4322">'''Farmland preservation''' is a joint effort by [[non-governmental organization]]s and [[local government]]s to set aside and protect examples of a region's [[farmland (farming)|farmland]] for the use, education, and enjoyment of future generations. It is often a part of [[regional planning]] and national [[historic preservation]].

==History==
[[New Jersey]] passed the [[Farmland Assessment Act of 1964]] to mitigate the loss of farmland to rapid [[suburbanization|suburban development]] through the use of favorable tax assessments. But by the late 1970s, the value of farmland had outstripped the tax benefits of the act, so the state purchased [[deed]] restrictions on farms through the [[Agriculture Retention and Development Act]] of 1981. 

Regional efforts in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey]] include the [[Navesink Highlands]] [[Greenway (landscape)|Greenway]], a project of the Monmouth County Farmland Preservation Program, which, along with the Monmouth Conservation Foundation, purchased the development rights of the Holly Crest Farm in [[Middletown, New Jersey|Middletown]] in September 2008 for US $2.5 million. Over 20 percent of county farmlands and open spaces are permanently preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Sametta M. Sale Preserves Middletown Farm. "Asbury Park Press," 11 September 2008, B4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Farmland Trust]] was established in 1980 to preserve farmland and promote sustainable farming practices.

The [[Genesee Valley Conservancy]] was founded in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1990.

==Farmland protection==
Farmland protection refers to programs in the [[United States]], operated mostly at state and local levels by government agencies or private entities such as [[land trust]]s, that are designed to limit conversion of [[agricultural land]] to other uses that otherwise might have been more financially attractive to the land owner. Every [[U.S. state|state]] provides tax relief through differential (preferential) assessment, and has right-to-farm laws. Less common approaches include establishing agricultural districts, using [[Agricultural zoning|zoning]] to protect agricultural land,&lt;ref name=Montgomery&gt;See, for example, [[Montgomery County, Maryland Agricultural Reserve]].&lt;/ref&gt; purchasing development rights, and [[transferable development rights]].&lt;ref name=Montgomery /&gt;

==Management of protected farmland==
[[Conservation easement]] is one approach used to manage protected farms.

A [[transferable development rights]] program offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of agricultural land. [[Land development|Land developers]] can purchase the development rights of certain properties within a designated "sending district" and transfer the rights to another "receiving district" to increase the density of their new development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farmland.org//programs/states/wa/documents/APPENDIXH-Transferofdevelopmentrights.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116082248/http://www.farmland.org//programs/states/wa/documents/APPENDIXH-Transferofdevelopmentrights.pdf |title=Transfer of Development Rights; Fact Sheet |date=April 2008 |archive-date=2011-01-16 |publisher=American Farmland Trust |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely-noted example of a sending district is the [[Montgomery County, Maryland Agricultural Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montgomeryplanning.org/planning/agricultural-reserve/ |title=Agricultural Reserve |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-02-23 |publisher=Montgomery County Planning Department |location=Silver Spring, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
Self-regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity, and the idea of feedback had started to enter economic theory in Britain by the eighteenth century, but it wasn't at that time recognized as a universal abstraction and so didn't have a name.&lt;ref name=mayr&gt;
{{Cite book |author= [[Otto Mayr]]|title=Authority, liberty, &amp; automatic machinery in early modern Europe |year=1989 |ISBN=0-8018-3939-4 | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb phrase "to feed back", in the sense of ''returning to an earlier position'' in a mechanical process, was in use in the US by the 1860s,&lt;ref&gt;
''"Heretofore ... it has been necessary to reverse the motion of the rollers, thus causing the material to travel or feed back, ..."''
HH Cole, "Improvement in Fluting-Machines", [http://www.google.co.nz/patents/US55469 US Patent 55,469 (1866)] accessed 23 Mar 2012.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
''"When the journal or spindle is cut ... and the carriage is about to feed back by a change of the sectional nut or burr upon the screw-shafts, the operator seizes the handle..."'' JM Jay, "Improvement in Machines for Making the Spindles of Wagon-Axles",  [http://www.google.co.nz/patents/US47769 US Patent 47,769 (1865)] accessed 23 Mar 2012.
&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1909, Nobel laureate [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] used the term "feed-back" as a noun to refer to (undesired) ''coupling'' between components of an electronic circuit.&lt;ref&gt;''"...as far as possible the circuit has no feed-back into the system being investigated."''
[http://www.cdvandtext2.org/Braun-Nobel-lecture%201909.pdf]
Karl Ferdinand Braun, [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/braun-lecture.html "Electrical oscillations and wireless telegraphy"], Nobel Lecture, 11 December 1909. Retrieved 19 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1912, researchers using early electronic amplifiers ([[audion tube|audions]]) had discovered that deliberately coupling part of the output signal back to the input circuit would boost the amplification (through [[Regenerative circuit|regeneration]]), but would also cause the audion to howl or sing.&lt;ref name="bennett"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0-906-04807-9|title=A history of control engineering, 1800–1930|author=Stuart Bennett|publisher=Peregrinus for the Institution of Electrical Engineers|year=1979|isbn=0-906048-07-9|location=Stevenage; New York}} 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=1gfKkqB_fTcC]
&lt;/ref&gt; This action of feeding back of the signal from output to input gave rise to the use of the term "feedback" as a distinct word by 1920.&lt;ref name=bennett/&gt;

Over the years there has been some dispute as to the best definition of feedback. According to [[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]] (1956), mathematicians and theorists interested in the ''principles'' of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of ''circularity of action'', which keeps the theory simple and consistent. For those with more ''practical'' aims, feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible connection.
{{Quote|[Practical experimenters] object to the mathematician's definition, pointing out that this would force them to say that feedback was present in the ordinary pendulum ... between its position and its momentum—a "feedback" that, from the practical point of view, is somewhat mystical. To this the mathematician retorts that if feedback is to be considered present only when there is an actual wire or nerve to represent it, then the theory becomes chaotic and riddled with irrelevancies.&lt;ref name=Ashby/&gt;{{rp|page=54}}}}

Focusing on uses in management theory, Ramaprasad (1983) defines feedback generally as "...information about the gap between the actual level and the reference level of a system parameter" that is used to "alter the gap in some way." He emphasizes that the information by itself is not feedback unless translated into action.&lt;ref name="Ramaprasad"&gt;Arkalgud Ramaprasad, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bs.3830280103/pdf "On The Definition of Feedback"], ''Behavioral Science'', Volume 28, Issue 1. 1983. Last accessed 16 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Positive and negative feedback===
{{Main|Negative feedback|Positive feedback}}
[[File:Set-point control.png|thumb|350px|Maintaining a desired system performance despite disturbance using negative feedback to reduce system error]]

There are two types of feedback: [[positive feedback]] and [[negative feedback]].

As an example of negative feedback, the diagram might represent a [[cruise control]] system in a car, for example, that matches a target speed such as the speed limit. The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a [[speedometer]].  The error signal is the departure of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimizing the road disturbance.

The terms "positive" and "negative" were first applied to feedback prior to WWII. The idea of positive feedback was already current in the 1920s with the introduction of the [[regenerative circuit]].&lt;ref name=mindell&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Friis and Jensen (1924) described regeneration in a set of electronic amplifiers as a case where ''the "feed-back" action is positive'' in contrast to negative feed-back action, which they mention only in passing.&lt;ref name=friis&gt;
Friis, H.T., and A.G.Jensen. "High Frequency Amplifiers" Bell System Technical Journal 3 (April 1924):181–205.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Stephen Black]]'s classic 1934 paper first details the use of negative feedback in electronic amplifiers. According to Black:

{{Quote|Positive feed-back increases the gain of the amplifier, negative feed-back reduces it.&lt;ref name=black&gt;
H.S. Black, "Stabilized feed-back amplifiers", ''Electrical Engineering'', vol. 53, pp.&amp;nbsp;114–120, January 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Mindell (2002) confusion in the terms arose shortly after this:
{{Quote|...Friis and Jensen had made the same distinction Black used between "positive feed-back" and "negative feed-back", based not on the sign of the feedback itself but rather on its effect on the amplifier's gain. In contrast, Nyquist and Bode, when they built on Black's work, referred to negative feedback as that with the sign reversed. Black had trouble convincing others of the utility of his invention in part because confusion existed over basic matters of definition.&lt;ref name=mindell/&gt;{{rp|page=121}}}}

Even prior to the terms being applied, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] had described several kinds of "component motions" associated with the [[centrifugal governor]]s used in steam engines, distinguishing between those that lead to a continual ''increase'' in a disturbance or the amplitude of an oscillation, and those that lead to a ''decrease'' of the same.&lt;ref name=maxwell&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=James Clerk|title=On Governors|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:On_Governors.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume= 16|year= 1868 |pages= 270–283|doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminology====
The terms positive and negative feedback are defined in different ways within different disciplines.

# the altering of the ''gap'' between reference and actual values of a parameter, based on whether the gap is ''widening'' (positive) or ''narrowing'' (negative).&lt;ref name="Ramaprasad" /&gt;
# the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of the ''action'' or ''effect'' that alters the gap, based on whether it has a ''happy'' (positive) or ''unhappy'' (negative) emotional connotation to the recipient or observer.&lt;ref name=herold1977&gt;Herold, David M., and Martin M. Greller. "Research Notes. FEEDBACK THE DEFINITION OF A CONSTRUCT." Academy of management Journal 20.1 (1977): 142-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two definitions may cause confusion, such as when an incentive (reward) is used to boost poor performance (narrow a gap). Referring to definition 1, some authors use alternative terms, replacing ''positive/negative'' with ''self-reinforcing/self-correcting'',&lt;ref name="senge"&gt;

Hermann A Haus and Richard B. Adler, ''Circuit Theory of Linear Noisy Networks'', MIT Press, 1959
&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. And for definition 2, some authors advocate describing the action or effect as positive/negative ''[[Reinforcement#Reinforcement|reinforcement]]'' or ''[[Reinforcement#Punishment|punishment]]'' rather than feedback.&lt;ref name="Ramaprasad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skinner"&gt;
BF Skinner, ''The Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', American Scientist, Vol. 45, No. 4 (SEPTEMBER 1957), pp. 343-371&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet even within a single discipline an example of feedback can be called either positive or negative, depending on how values are measured or referenced.&lt;ref&gt;
"However, after scrutinizing the statistical properties of the structural equations, the members of the committee assured themselves that it is possible to have a significant positive feedback loop when using standardized scores, and a negative loop when using real scores."
Ralph L. Levine, Hiram E. Fitzgerald. ''Analysis of dynamic psychological systems: methods and applications'', {{ISBN|978-0306437465}} (1992) page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

This confusion may arise because feedback can be used for either ''informational'' or ''motivational'' purposes, and often has both a ''[[Qualitative property|qualitative]]'' and a ''[[Quantitative property|quantitative]]'' component. As Connellan and Zemke (1993) put it:
{{Quote|''Quantitative'' feedback tells us how much and how many. ''Qualitative'' feedback tells us how good, bad or indifferent.&lt;ref name=Connellan&gt;Thomas K. Connellan and Ron Zemke, "Sustaining Knock Your Socks Off Service" AMACOM, 1 July 1993. {{ISBN|0-8144-7824-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=102}}}}

====Limitations of negative and positive feedback====
While simple systems can sometimes be described as one or the other type, many systems with feedback loops cannot be so easily designated as simply positive or negative, and this is especially true when multiple loops are present.

{{Quote|When there are only two parts joined so that each affects the other, the properties of the feedback give important and useful information about the properties of the whole. But when the parts rise to even as few as four, if every one affects the other three, then twenty circuits can be traced through them; and knowing the properties of all the twenty circuits does not give complete information about the system.&lt;ref name=Ashby/&gt;{{rp|page=54}}}}

===Other types of feedback===
In general, feedback systems can have many signals fed back and the feedback loop frequently contain mixtures of positive and negative feedback where positive and negative feedback can dominate at different frequencies or different points in the state space of a system.

The term bipolar feedback has been coined to refer to biological systems where positive and negative feedback systems can interact, the output of one affecting the input of another, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Smit&gt;
{{cite book |title=Introduction to Bioregulatory Medicine |author1=Alta Smit |author2=Arturo O'Byrne |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzXAOUnCM3oC&amp;pg=PA6 |page=6 |chapter=Bipolar feedback |isbn=9783131469717 |year=2011 |publisher=Thieme}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systems with feedback can have very complex behaviors such as [[Chaos theory|chaotic behaviors]] in non-linear systems, while others have much more predictable behaviors, such as those that are used to make and design digital systems.

Feedback is used extensively in digital systems. For example, binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where the current state and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it.

==Applications==
===Dynamical systems===
{{Main|Dynamical system|Chaos theory|Edge of chaos|Control theory}}
By using feedback properties, the behavior of a system can be altered to meet the needs of an application; systems can be made stable, responsive or held constant. It is shown that dynamical systems with a feedback experience an adaptation to the [[edge of chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wotherspoon|first1=T.|last2=Hubler|first2=A.|title=Adaptation to the edge of chaos with random-wavelet feedback|journal=J. Phys. Chem. A|date=2009|doi=10.1021/jp804420g|volume=113|pages=19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
{{See also|Homeostasis|Allostasis}}
In [[biology|biological]] systems such as [[organism]]s, [[ecosystem]]s, or the [[biosphere]], most parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions. The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments. A change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel. An example of this is [[insulin oscillation]]s.

Biological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits, both positive and negative. As in other contexts, ''positive'' and ''negative'' do not imply that the feedback causes ''good'' or ''bad'' effects. A negative feedback loop is one that tends to slow down a process, whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it. The [[mirror neuron]]s are part of a social feedback system, when an observed action is "mirrored" by the brain—like a self-performed action.

Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted molecules that act as mediators; failure of key feedback mechanisms in cancer disrupts tissue function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vlahopoulos|first1=SA|last2=Cen|first2=O|last3=Hengen|first3=N|last4=Agan|first4=J|last5=Moschovi|first5=M|last6=Critselis|first6=E|last7=Adamaki|first7=M|last8=Bacopoulou|first8=F|last9=Copland|first9=JA|last10=Boldogh|first10=I|last11=Karin|first11=M|last12=Chrousos|first12=GP|title=Dynamic aberrant NF-κB spurs tumorigenesis: A new model encompassing the microenvironment.|journal=Cytokine &amp; Growth Factor Reviews|date=20 June 2015|pmid=26119834|doi=10.1016/j.cytogfr.2015.06.001|volume=26|pages=389–403|pmc=4526340}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an injured or infected tissue, inflammatory mediators elicit feedback responses in cells, which alter gene expression, and change the groups of molecules expressed and secreted, including molecules that induce diverse cells to cooperate and restore tissue structure and function. This type of feedback is important because it enables coordination of immune responses and recovery from infections and injuries. During cancer, key elements of this feedback fail. This disrupts tissue function and immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vlahopoulos | first1 = SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-κB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode. | journal = Cancer biology &amp; medicine | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 | volume = 14 | pages = 254–270 | pmc = 5570602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korneev|first1=KV|last2=Atretkhany|first2=KN|last3=Drutskaya|first3=MS|last4=Grivennikov|first4=SI|last5=Kuprash|first5=DV|last6=Nedospasov|first6=SA|title=TLR-signaling and proinflammatory cytokines as drivers of tumorigenesis.|journal=Cytokine|date=January 2017|volume=89|pages=127–135|doi=10.1016/j.cyto.2016.01.021|pmid=26854213|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466616300229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanisms of feedback were first elucidated in bacteria, where a nutrient elicits changes in some of their metabolic functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Sanwal|first1=BD| title= Allosteric controls of amphilbolic pathways in bacteria.|journal= Bacteriol. Rev.|date=March 1970|volume=34|pages=20–39 |pmid=4315011 |pmc=378347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Feedback is also central to the operations of [[gene]]s and [[gene regulatory network]]s. [[Repressor protein|Repressor]] (see [[Lac repressor]]) and [[activator protein|activator]] [[protein]]s are used to create genetic [[operon]]s, which were identified by [[Francois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] in 1961 as ''feedback loops''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Jacob|first1=F|last2=Monod|first2=J|title= Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins.|journal= J Mol Biol|date=June 1961|volume=3|pages=318–356 |pmid=13718526}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feedback loops may be positive (as in the case of the coupling between a sugar molecule and the proteins that import sugar into a bacterial cell), or negative (as is often the case in [[metabolic]] consumption).

On a larger scale, feedback can have a stabilizing effect on animal populations even when profoundly affected by external changes, although time lags in feedback response can give rise to [[Lotka–Volterra equation|predator-prey cycles]].&lt;ref&gt;
CS Holling. "Resilience and stability of ecological systems". Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 4:1-23. 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fermentation (biochemistry)|zymology]], feedback serves as regulation of activity of an enzyme by its direct product(s) or downstream metabolite(s) in the metabolic pathway (see [[Allosteric regulation]]).

The [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] is largely controlled by positive and negative feedback, much of which is still unknown.

In [[psychology]], the body receives a stimulus from the environment or internally that causes the release of [[hormone]]s. Release of hormones then may cause more of those hormones to be released, causing a positive feedback loop. This cycle is also found in certain behaviour. For example, "shame loops" occur in people who blush easily. When they realize that they are blushing, they become even more embarrassed, which leads to further blushing, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheff |first=Thomas |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lets-connect/200909/the-emotionalrelational-world |title=The Emotional/Relational World |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate science===
{{Main|Climate change feedback}}

The climate system is characterized by strong positive and negative feedback loops between processes that affect the state of the atmosphere, ocean, and land. A simple example is the [[Ice-albedo feedback|ice-albedo positive feedback]] loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground (of lower [[albedo]]), which in turn absorbs heat and causes more snow to melt.

===Control theory===
{{Main|Control theory}}
Feedback is extensively used in control theory, using a variety of methods including [[state space (controls)]], [[full state feedback]] (also known as pole placement), and so forth. Note that in the context of control theory, "feedback" is traditionally assumed to specify "negative feedback".&lt;ref name=mees&gt;
''"There is a tradition in control theory that one deals with a ''negative feedback loop'' in which a negative sign is included in the feedback loop..."'' 
A.I.Mees, "Dynamics of Feedback Systems", New York: J. Wiley, c1981. {{ISBN|0-471-27822-X}}. p69&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Further|PID controller}}
The most common general-purpose [[controller (control theory)|controller]] using a control-loop feedback mechanism is a [[PID controller|proportional-integral-derivative]] (PID) controller. Heuristically, the terms of a PID controller can be interpreted as corresponding to time: the proportional term depends on the ''present'' error, the integral term on the accumulation of ''past'' errors, and the derivative term is a prediction of ''future'' error, based on current rate of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.eolss.net/ebooks/Sample%20Chapters/C18/E6-43-03-03.pdf | title = PID Control | last = Araki | first = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical engineering===
In ancient times, the [[float valve]] was used to regulate the flow of water in Greek and Roman [[water clock]]s; similar float valves are used to regulate fuel in a [[carburettor]] and also used to regulate tank water level in the [[flush toilet]].

The Dutch inventor [[Cornelius Drebbel]] (1572-1633) built thermostats (c1620) to control the temperature of chicken incubators and chemical furnaces. In 1745, the windmill was improved by blacksmith Edmund Lee, who added a [[windmill fantail|fantail]] to keep the face of the windmill pointing into the wind. In 1787, [[Thomas Mead]] regulated the rotation speed of a windmill by using a [[conical pendulum|centrifugal pendulum]] to adjust the distance between the bedstone and the runner stone (i.e., to adjust the load).

The use of the [[centrifugal governor]] by [[James Watt]] in 1788 to regulate the speed of his [[steam engine]] was one factor leading to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Steam engines also use float valves and [[relief valve|pressure release valves]] as mechanical regulation devices. A [[mathematical analysis]] of Watt's governor was done by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868.&lt;ref name=maxwell/&gt;

The ''[[SS Great Eastern|Great Eastern]]'' was one of the largest steamships of its time and employed a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in 1866 by [[John McFarlane Gray]]. [[Joseph Farcot]] coined the word ''[[Servomechanism|servo]]'' in 1873 to describe steam-powered steering systems. Hydraulic servos were later used to position guns. [[Elmer Ambrose Sperry]] of the [[Sperry Corporation]] designed the first [[autopilot]] in 1912. [[Nicolas Minorsky]] published a theoretical analysis of automatic ship steering in 1922 and described the [[PID controller]].&lt;ref name="Minorsky"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minorsky, Nicolas |year=1922 |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=J. Amer. Soc of Naval Engineers |volume=34 |issue= |pages=280–309 |publisher= |doi= 10.1111/j.1559-3584.1922.tb04958.x|pmid= |pmc= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal combustion engines of the late 20th century employed mechanical feedback mechanisms such as the [[Ignition timing#Vacuum timing advance|vacuum timing advance]] but mechanical feedback was replaced by electronic [[engine control unit|engine management systems]] once small, robust and powerful single-chip [[microcontroller]]s became affordable.

The use of feedback is widespread in the design of [[electronics|electronic]] amplifiers, oscillators, and stateful logic circuit elements such as flip-flops and counters. Electronic feedback systems are also very commonly used to control mechanical, thermal and other physical processes.

If the signal is inverted on its way round the control loop, the system is said to have ''[[negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]]'';&lt;ref name=KalS&gt;
{{cite book |title=Basic Electronics: Devices, Circuits and IT Fundamentals |author=Santiram Kal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bw_-ZyGL6YC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=%22it+is+called+negative+feedback%22+%22if+the+feedback+signal+reduces+the+input+signal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XhXTU7bjLqTHiwKMnoDoDg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22it%20is%20called%20negative%20feedback%22%20%22if%20the%20feedback%20signal%20reduces%20the%20input%20signal%22&amp;f=false |quote=If the feedback signal reduces the input signal, ''i.e.'' it is out of phase with the input [signal], it is called negative feedback. |isbn=9788120319523 |year=2009 |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd |page=191}}
&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise, the feedback is said to be ''positive''. Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the [[BIBO stability|stability]] and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted changes.  This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it.  When this happens, the lag in arrival of the correcting signal can result in overcorrection, causing the output to [[oscillation|oscillate]] or "hunt".&lt;ref&gt;With mechanical devices, hunting can be severe enough to destroy the device.&lt;/ref&gt; While often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour, this effect is used deliberately in electronic oscillators.

[[Harry Nyquist]] at [[Bell Labs]] derived the [[Nyquist stability criterion]] for determining the stability of feedback systems. An easier method, but less general, is to use [[Bode plot]]s developed by [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Hendrik Bode]] to determine the [[Gain margin|gain margin and phase margin]]. Design to ensure stability often involves [[frequency compensation]] to control the location of the [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s of the amplifier.

Electronic feedback loops are used to control the output of [[electronics|electronic]] devices, such as [[amplifiers]]. A feedback loop is created when all or some portion of the output is fed back to the input. A device is said to be operating ''open loop'' if no output feedback is being employed and ''closed loop'' if feedback is being used.&lt;ref&gt;P. Horowitz &amp; W. Hill, ''The Art of Electronics'', Cambridge University Press (1980), Chapter 3, relating to operational amplifiers.&lt;/ref&gt;

When two or more amplifiers are cross-coupled using positive feedback, complex behaviors can be created. These ''[[multivibrator]]s'' are widely used and include:

* astable circuits, which act as oscillators
* monostable circuits, which can be pushed into a state, and will return to the stable state after some time
* bistable circuits, which have two stable states that the circuit can be switched between

====Negative feedback====
A Negative feedback occurs when the fed-back output signal has a relative phase of 180° with respect to the input signal (upside down). This situation is sometimes referred to as being ''out of phase'', but that term also is used to indicate other phase separations, as in "90° out of phase". Negative feedback can be used to correct output errors or to desensitize a system to unwanted fluctuations.&lt;ref name=Bhattacharya&gt;
For an analysis of desensitization in the system pictured, see {{cite book |author=S.K Bhattacharya |title=Linear Control Systems |pages=134–135 |quote=The parameters of a system ... may vary... The primary advantage of using feedback in control systems is to reduce the system's sensitivity to parameter variations. |chapter=§5.3.1 Effect of feedback on parameter variations |isbn=9788131759523 |publisher=Pearson Education India |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5Z1A_6jxAUC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22primary+advantage+of+using+feedback+in+control+system+is+to+reduce+the+system%27s+sensitivity+to+parameter+variations%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BbX8U_zpMIKcjAKklYGoDQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22primary%20advantage%20of%20using%20feedback%20in%20control%20system%20is%20to%20reduce%20the%20system%27s%20sensitivity%20to%20parameter%20variations%22&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In feedback amplifiers, this correction is generally for waveform [[distortion]] reduction{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} or to establish a specified [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] level. A general expression for the gain of a negative feedback amplifier is the [[asymptotic gain model]].

====Positive feedback====
Positive feedback occurs when the fed-back signal is in phase with the input signal. Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the input signal to the point where the output of the device [[oscillates]] between its maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce [[hysteresis]] into a circuit. This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones. It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device to latch, i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state. This fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make [[Flip-flop (electronics)|bistable]] circuits for volatile storage of information.

The loud squeals that sometimes occurs in [[audio system]]s, [[public address system|PA systems]], and [[rock music]] are known as [[audio feedback]]. If a microphone is in front of a loudspeaker that it is connected to, sound that the microphone picks up comes out of the speaker, and is picked up by the microphone and re-amplified.  If the [[loop gain]] is sufficient, howling or squealing at the maximum power of the amplifier is possible.

====Oscillator====
[[File:OpAmpHystereticOscillator.svg|thumb|A popular [[Relaxation oscillator#Comparator–based electronic relaxation oscillator|op-amp relaxation oscillator]].]]
An [[electronic oscillator]] is an [[electronic circuit]] that produces a periodic, [[oscillation|oscillating]] electronic signal, often a [[sine wave]] or a [[square wave]].&lt;ref name="Snelgrove"&gt;{{cite web

Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by [[Radio transmitter|radio]] and [[television transmitter]]s, clock signals that regulate computers and [[quartz clock]]s, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref name="Snelgrove" /&gt;

Oscillators are often characterized by the [[frequency]] of their output signal:

* A [[low frequency oscillation|low-frequency oscillator]] (LFO) is an electronic oscillator that generates a frequency below ≈20&amp;nbsp;Hz.  This term is typically used in the field of audio [[synthesizers]], to distinguish it from an audio frequency oscillator.
* An audio oscillator&lt;!--Please don't link - circular reference--&gt; produces frequencies in the [[audio frequency|audio]] range, about 16&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay" /&gt;
* An RF oscillator produces signals in the [[radio frequency]] (RF) range of about 100&amp;nbsp;kHz to 100&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay" /&gt;

Oscillators designed to produce a high-power AC output from a DC supply are usually called [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]].

There are two main types of electronic oscillator: the linear or harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear or [[relaxation oscillator]].&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garg"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:R-S mk2.gif|thumb|right|An SR latch, constructed from a pair of cross-coupled [[NOR gate|NOR]] [[logic gate|gates]].]][[File:JohnsonCounter2.png|thumb|border|A 4-bit [[ring counter]] using [[Flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|D-type flip flops]]]]

A latch or a [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] is a [[electronic circuit|circuit]] that has two stable states and can be used to store state information. They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in [[sequential logic]]. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of [[digital electronics]] systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.

Latches and flip-flops are used as data storage elements. Such data storage can be used for storage of ''[[state (computer science)|state]]'', and such a circuit is described as [[sequential logic]]. When used in a [[finite-state machine]], the output and next state depend not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence, previous inputs). It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal.

Flip-flops can be either simple (transparent or opaque) or [[clock signal|clock]]ed (synchronous or edge-triggered).  Although the term flip-flop has historically referred generically to both simple and clocked circuits, in modern usage it is common to reserve the term ''flip-flop'' exclusively for discussing clocked circuits; the simple ones are commonly called ''latches''.&lt;ref name="pedroni"&gt;

Using this terminology, a latch is level-sensitive, whereas a flip-flop is edge-sensitive. That is, when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent, while a flip flop's output only changes on a single type (positive going or negative going) of clock edge.

===Software===
Feedback loops provide generic mechanisms for controlling the running, maintenance, and evolution of software and computing systems.&lt;ref name="Giese-at-al-engineering-saso-systems"&gt;

====User interface design====
{{Main|User interface design}}

Feedback is also a useful design principle for designing [[user interface]]s.

===Video feedback===
[[Video feedback]] is the [[video]] equivalent of [[acoustic feedback]].  It involves a loop between a [[video camera]] input and a video output, e.g., a [[Television|television screen]] or [[video monitor|monitor]].  Aiming the camera at the display produces a complex video image based on the feedback.&lt;ref name=hofstadter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|title=I Am a Strange loop|year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-03079-8|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economics and finance====
The [[stock market]] is an example of a [[system]] prone to oscillatory "hunting", governed by positive and negative feedback resulting from [[Behavioural economics|cognitive and emotional factors]] among market participants. For example:

* When stocks are rising (a [[bull market]]), the belief that further rises are probable gives investors an incentive to buy (positive feedback—reinforcing the rise, see also [[stock market bubble]] and [[momentum investing]]); but the increased price of the [[stock|shares]], and the [[knowledge]] that there must be a peak after which the market falls, ends up deterring buyers (negative feedback—stabilizing the rise).
* Once the market begins to fall regularly (a [[bear market]]), some investors may expect further losing days and refrain from buying (positive feedback—reinforcing the fall), but others may buy because stocks become more and more of a bargain (negative feedback—stabilizing the fall, see also [[contrarian investing]]).

[[George Soros]] used the word ''[[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]],'' to describe feedback in the financial markets and developed an [[investment]] theory based on this principle.

The conventional [[economic equilibrium]] model of [[supply and demand]] supports only ideal linear negative feedback and was heavily criticized by [[Paul Ormerod]] in his book ''[[The Death of Economics]]'', which, in turn, was criticized by traditional economists. This book was part of a change of perspective as economists started to recognise that [[chaos theory]] applied to nonlinear feedback systems including financial markets.

The '''Hatteras Weather Bureau Station''' is a wood-frame building in [[Hatteras, North Carolina]] built in 1901 for what was then called the [[U.S. Weather Bureau]].  The then-remote location on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] provided data on conditions in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from a fixed location that was farther into the ocean environment than any on the Atlantic coast. The building served as a weather station from 1902 to 1946, when it was converted to living quarters for Weather Bureau personnel. In 1952 the property was turned over to the [[U.S. Coast Guard]], which used it until 1958, when it was transferred to the [[National Park Service]] for use by [[Cape Hatteras National Seashore]]. From 1958 to 1976 the building was used as a research station, first by [[Duke University]] and later by [[North Carolina State University]] for investigations concerning marine [[invertebrate]]s.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Hatteras Weather Bureau Station|url={{NRHP url|id=78000268}} |format=pdf|date=February 15, 1977 |author=Ronald G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4156">'''Hilbrand Johannes''' "'''Hip'''" '''Groenewold''' (1910–1996) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[theoretical physicist]] who pioneered the largely operator-free formulation of [[quantum mechanics]] in [[phase space]] known as [[phase space formulation|phase-space quantization]].

==Biography==
Groenewold was born on 29 June 1910 in [[Muntendam]] in the province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. He graduated from the [[University of Groningen]], with a major in physics and  minors in mathematics and mechanics in 1934. After a visit to Cambridge to interact with [[John von Neumann]] (1934-5) on the links between classical and quantum mechanics, and a checkered career working with [[Frits Zernike]] in Groningen, then Leiden, the Hague, [[De Bilt]], and several addresses in the North of the Netherlands during World War II, he earned his Ph.D. degree in 1946, under the tutelage of [[Léon Rosenfeld]] at [[Utrecht University]].  In 1951, he obtained a  position in Groningen in theoretical physics, first as a lecturer, then as a senior lecturer, and finally as a professor in 1955.  He was the initiator and organizer of the Vosbergen Conference in the Netherlands for over two decades.

His 1946 thesis paper &lt;ref&gt;H.J. Groenewold (1946), "On the Principles of elementary quantum mechanics", ''Physica'' '''12''', pp. 405-460. {{doi|10.1016/S0031-8914(46)80059-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  laid the foundations of [[phase space formulation|quantum mechanics in phase space]], in unwitting parallel with [[José Enrique Moyal|J. E. Moyal]]. This treatise was the first to achieve full understanding of the [[Wigner–Weyl transform]] as an invertible transform, rather than as an unsatisfactory quantization rule. Significantly, this work further formulated and first appreciated the all-important  [[Moyal product|star-product]], the cornerstone of this formulation of the theory, ironically often also associated with Moyal's name, even though it is not featured in Moyal's papers and was not fully understood by Moyal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Zachos | first2 = C. K. | doi = 10.1142/S2251158X12000069 | title = Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space | journal = Asia Pacific Physics Newsletter | volume = 01 | pages = 37 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1104.5269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moreover, Groenewold first understood and demonstrated that the [[Moyal bracket]] is isomorphic to the [[quantum]] [[commutator]], and thus that the latter ''cannot be made to faithfully correspond'' to the [[Poisson bracket]], as had been envisioned by [[Paul Dirac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dirac | first1 = P. A. M. | title = The Fundamental Equations of Quantum Mechanics | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1925.0150 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 752 | pages = 642 | year = 1925 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1925RSPSA.109..642D }}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation and his counterexamples contrasting Poisson brackets to commutators have  been generalized and codified to what is now known as the ''Groenewold – [[Léon Van Hove|Van Hove]] theorem''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 13.13 for one version of this result&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Canonical_quantization#Groenewold.27s_theorem|Groenewold's theorem]] for one version.

This is a '''list of [[inventor]]s from the [[Russian Federation]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Russian Empire]], [[Tsardom of Russia]] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]''', including both ethnic [[Russians]] and people of other ethnicities.

This list also includes those who were born in Russia or its predecessor states but later emigrated, and those who were born elsewhere but immigrated to the country or worked there for a considerable time, (producing inventions on Russian soil).

For Russian inventions in chronological order, see the [[Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records]].

{{Anatomical lists |expanded=general}}


The list below describes such skeletal movements as normally are possible in particular joints of the human body. Other animals have different degrees of movement at their respective joints; this is because of differences in positions of muscles and because structures peculiar to the bodies of humans and other species block motions unsuited to their anatomies.

The muscles [[tibialis anterior]] and [[tibialis posterior]] invert the foot. Some sources also state that the [[triceps surae]] and [[extensor hallucis longus]] invert.&lt;ref name=GROSSANATOMY2005 /&gt;{{rp|123}} Inversion occurs at the [[subtalar joint]] and [[transverse tarsal joint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upstate.edu/cdb/grossanat/limbs9.shtml |title=Gross Anatomy: Functional Anatomy Of The Ankle And Foot |accessdate=December 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823072214/http://www.upstate.edu/cdb/grossanat/limbs9.shtml# |archive-date=2009-08-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eversion of the foot occurs at the [[subtalar joint]]. The muscles involved in this include [[Fibularis longus]] and [[fibularis brevis]], which are innervated by the [[superficial fibular nerve]]. Some sources also state that the [[fibularis tertius]] everts.&lt;ref name=GROSSANATOMY2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Kyung Won, PhD.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Dorsiflexion of the foot: The muscles involved include those of the [[Anterior compartment of leg]], specifically  [[tibialis anterior muscle]], [[extensor hallucis longus muscle]], [[extensor digitorum longus muscle]], and [[peroneus tertius]]. The range of motion for dorsiflexion indicated in the literature varies from 12.2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boone |first1=Donna C. |last2=Azen |first2=Stanley P. |title=Normal range  of motion of joints in male subjects |journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |date=July 1979 |volume=61-A |pages=756–759 |url=http://jbjs.org/pdfaccess.ashx?ResourceID=23647&amp;PDFSource=17 |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|title=Joint Motion: Method of Measuring and Recording|year=1965|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roaas |first1=Asbjørn |last2=Andersson |first2=Gunnar B.

Plantarflexion of the foot: Primary muscles for plantar flexion are situated in the [[Posterior compartment of leg]], namely the superficial [[Gastrocnemius]], [[Soleus]] and [[Plantaris]] (only weak participation), and the deep muscles [[Flexor hallucis longus]], [[Flexor digitorum longus]] and [[Tibialis posterior]]. Muscles in the [[Lateral compartment of leg]]  also weakly participate, namely the [[Fibularis longus]] and [[Fibularis brevis]] muscles. Those in the lateral compartment only have weak participation in plantar flexion though. The range of motion for plantar flexion is usually indicated in the literature as 30° to 40°, but sometimes also 50°. The nerves are primarily from the [[Sacral nerves|sacral]] spinal cord roots S1 and S2. Compression of S1 roots may result in weakness in plantarflexion; these nerves run from the lower back to the bottom of the foot. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

''[[:wikt:pronation|Pronation]]'' at the [[forearm]] is a rotational movement at the [[Proximal radioulnar articulation|radioulnar joint]], or of the [[foot]] at the [[subtalar joint|subtalar]] and [[talocalcaneonavicular joint]]s.&lt;ref name="Kendall et al."&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kendall |first1=F. P. |last2=McCreary |first2=E. K. |last3=Provance |first3=P. G. |title=Muscles Testing and Function |year=1993 |edition=4th |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |isbn=0-683-04576-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brukner and Khan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brukner |first1=P. |last2=Khan |first2=K. |title=Clinical Sports Medicine |year=1993 |edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |isbn=0-07-452852-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the forearm, when standing in the [[anatomical position]], pronation will move the palm of the hand from an anterior-facing position to a posterior-facing position without an associated movement at the [[shoulder joint]]). This corresponds to a [[counterclockwise]] twist for the right forearm and a [[clockwise]] twist for the left (when viewed superiorly). In the forearm, this action is performed by [[pronator quadratus]] and [[pronator teres muscle]]. [[Brachioradialis]] puts the forearm into a midpronated/supinated position from either full pronation or supination. For the foot, pronation will cause the sole of the foot to face more laterally than when standing in the anatomical position.

Pronation of the foot is a compound movement that combines [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]], [[Eversion (kinesiology)|eversion]], and [[dorsiflexion]]. Regarding posture, a pronated foot is one in which the heel bone angles inward and the arch tends to collapse.  Pronation is the motion of the inner and outer ball of the foot with the heel bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://realhealthynet.com/2012/07/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/ |title=Foot in the bottom of the foot – RealHealthyNet |publisher=Realhealthynet.com |date=July 11, 2012 |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719182112/http://realhealthynet.com/2012/07/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/# |archive-date=2013-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One is said to be "[[knock-kneed]]" if one has overly pronated feet. It flattens the arch as the foot strikes the ground in order to absorb shock when the heel hits the ground, and to assist in balance during mid-stance.  If habits develop, this action can lead to foot pain as well as knee pain, [[shin splints]], [[achilles tendinitis]], posterior tibial tendinitis, [[piriformis syndrome]], and [[plantar fasciitis]].{{Citation needed|reason=this is the received wisdom in running, but a citation would be nice.|date=May 2011}}.

==Free and open-source software==
===Cloud and on-line spreadsheets===
{{main|List of online spreadsheets}}
* [[Sheetster]] – "Community Edition" is available under the [[Affero GPL]]
*[https://www.zoho.com/sheet/ Zoho Sheet] - A simple, collaborative spreadsheet software.
* [[Simple Spreadsheet]]
* [[Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware]] includes a spreadsheet since 2004 and migrated to jQuery.sheet in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://doc.tiki.org/Spreadsheet | publisher = Tiki | title = Spreadsheet}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wikiCalc]] (now called SocialCalc)
* [[Airtable]] - a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet.

===Spreadsheets that are parts of suites===
* [[Gnumeric]]&amp;nbsp;— for [[Linux]].  Started as the [[GNOME]] desktop spreadsheet.  Reasonably lightweight but has very advanced features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/downloads.shtml | publisher = Gnome | title = Office | contribution = Gnumeric | type = downloads}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[KSpread]]&amp;nbsp;— following the fork of the [[Calligra Suite]] from [[KOffice]] in mid-2010, superseded by [[KCells]] in [[KOffice]] and [[Calligra Sheets|Sheets]] in the Calligra Suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.koffice.org/ | title = The KOffice Project}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[LibreOffice]] [[LibreOffice Calc|Calc]]&amp;nbsp;— developed for MS Windows, GNU/Linux, [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and Apple [[OS X|Macintosh]] (Mac) operating systems by [[The Document Foundation]].  The Document Foundation was formed in mid-2010 by several large organisations such as [[Google]], [[Red Hat]], [[Canonical Ltd|Canonical]] ([[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]) and [[Novell]] along with the OpenOffice.org community (developed by [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]) and various OpenOffice.org forks, notably [[Go-oo]].  Go-oo had been the "OpenOffice" used in Ubuntu and elsewhere.  Started as [[StarOffice]] in the late 1990s, it became OpenOffice under [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] and then LibreOffice in mid-2010.  The Document Foundation works with external organisations such as NeoOffice and [[Apache Foundation]] to help drive all three products forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.libreoffice.org/ | title = LibreOffice}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Master of Science in Biological Sciences''' is a specific degree to a [[Master's Degree]] in the field of the [[Biological Sciences]]. This is a higher degree taken up in the [[Graduate School]] provided by a [[university]]. This degree is usually specific to those who have accomplished their undergraduate studies in any field under the [[Natural Sciences]].

The advancement in the study of this field offers a lot more specific fields of study such as [[Plant Biology]], [[Molecular Biology]], and [[Zoology|Animal Biology]]. It requires at least 2 years of graduate studies. It may or may not require any thesis or research work, depending on the program offered by the university. There are laboratory works, lectures, and research works involved in this degree. There are also examinations given to the graduate students.

After one has finished his Master in Biological Sciences, he can become a [[researcher]], a [[professor]] for undergraduate studies, or he can also pursue a higher education in [[Doctoral]] Studies.

In his 2007 book '''''On Nuclear Terrorism''''', author [[Michael A. Levi]] surveys the issue of [[nuclear terrorism]] and explores the decisions a terrorist leader might take in pursuing a nuclear plot. Levi points out the many obstacles that such a terrorist scheme may encounter, which in turn leads to a host of possible ways that any terrorist plan could be foiled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/13915/on_nuclear_terrorism.html On Nuclear Terrorism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909073055/http://www.cfr.org/publication/13915/on_nuclear_terrorism.html |date=2008-09-09 }} {{ISBN|978-0-674-02649-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/LEVNUC.html On Nuclear Terrorism: Michael Levi]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[John Mueller]]'s 2010 book ''Atomic Obsession: Nuclear Alarmism From Hiroshima to Al-Qaeda'' is an expansion of the same theme.

Michael Levi is a Senior Fellow for energy and environment at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], New York.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20589">[[Wide area network|Online communication]] between [[home]] and [[school]] is the use of [[digital telecommunication]] to convey information and ideas between [[teacher]]s, [[student]]s, [[Parent-teacher conference|parent]]s, and school [[Academic administration|administrators]].  As the use of [[e-mail]] and the [[Internet access|internet]] becomes even more widespread, these tools become more valuable and useful in education for the purposes of increasing [[learning]] for students, and [[facilitation (business)|facilitating]] [[conversation]]s between students, parents, and schools.&lt;ref name=sup7/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup8/&gt;

== Overview ==

Online communication emphasizes 21st century skills, [[self-directed learning]], [[self-advocacy]], global awareness, and thinking skills for learners.&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"&gt;Watson, J., Gemin, B., &amp; International Association for K-12 Online, L. (2009). Management and Operations of Online Programs: Ensuring Quality and Accountability. Promising Practices in Online Learning. International Association for K-12 Online Learning&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilizing online communication methods, schools help students develop [[Netiquette]], and technical and [[computer skills]].&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup3/&gt;  In addition, teachers can provide parents with frequent information about school programs and their children's progress through automated e-mails, official [[website]]s and [[learning management system]]s.&lt;ref name=sup8/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup11/&gt; This communication can be achieved either [[synchronization|synchronously]] or [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]ly, providing greater time flexibility.&lt;ref name=sup11/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup9/&gt;

With online communication, learning may occur outside traditional school hours as students participate in collaborative activities, like reading and responding to [[Peer group|peer]] posts in online forums, [[experiment]]s, group [[project]]s, research papers, and current events assignments.&lt;ref name=sup4/&gt;   In addition, online communication can connect a wide range of individuals and increase the diversity of [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s that learners are exposed to.&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;

However, not all parents, students, or teachers have access to unlimited [[internet access]] or the digital technology necessary to participate in online communication, and it may be costly to initially implement the [[information technology]], [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]], and [[software]].&lt;ref name=sup1/&gt;  Furthermore, schools must provide [[Student orientation|orientation]] to the online environments and [[technical support]] to ensure that all potential [[User (telecommunications)|user]]s are ready to participate.&lt;ref name=sup3/&gt;  Teachers will also need to spend additional time online as active participants in the communication activities (e.g. act as the [[Forum moderator#Moderators|moderator]]s of discussions).&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup4/&gt;  In addition, the immediacy of online communication can lead to students and parents' unreasonable expectations that teachers be 'on-call' at all times.&lt;ref name=sup1&gt;Southern Regional Education Board (2003). Essential Principles of High-Quality Online Teaching: Guidelines for Evaluating K-12 Online Teachers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online communication between parents and school ==

Online communication between parents and schools are online methods that serve as a [[Computing platform|platform]] for parents and teachers to exchange ideas.  For teachers and administrators, online communication makes it easier to reach the parents and build the partnerships with parents.Online communication allows parents to receive real-time information about their child’s performance and activities at school, and flexible opportunities to ask questions and provide information to teachers and school administrators.

In this recent time of technology and modern educational sector, there are many ways to get instant connectivity with your university or college teachers. In the online education process the communication is playing a major role for both teachers and students. There are many online universities and colleges who offer their education services online and they create a good communication path where all the student and the teacher took participation to discuss with every other and this will also help to get problem resolve very early. For  those professional employees who stop their studies and start doing work. With the online education colleges and universities now they have an opportunity to get complete their education and complete their academic profile by having a higher degree on their resume. If you have a years of work experience in any field, but your employer doesn’t recognize you just because of your degree then there is a good news for you that the online universities also giving you the chance for apply your degree on the basis of your work experience.

=== Benefits ===

Creating [[Mode (literature)|mode]]s for online communication can increase parent participation in their children's education, which in turn increases students’ interest in their learning.  Online communication increases parents’ understanding of classroom [[Procedure (term)|procedures]], [[Philosophy|philosophies]] and [[Policy|policies]].  Parents then feel more involved in their child's school and more connected to the teacher.  In general, online communication improves parents’ attitudes toward conferencing with teachers and administrators.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup17/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;

This style of communication allows for more asynchronous communication and greater flexibility.  With online communication, parents can initiate conversations and express concerns to teachers and school officials easily.  In addition, informal communication through online [[Online chat|chat]]ting or [[Internet forum|forum]]s can reduce parents’ [[anxiety]] of meeting face-to-face with teachers and/or school officials.  When possible, online communication can also offer comfort through anonymity.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup17/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;

=== Challenges ===

Though most of the time, teachers and parents want to establish communication, there are some challenges that teacher and parents need to face together.  The most common challenges involve parent’s ability to use the [[software]], their access to consistent [[internet access]] and [[language barrier]]s.  There may be financial costs incurred by the school, if they provide [[training]] or [[translation]] to parents in order to make online communication more inclusive.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup24/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup24/&gt;

== Online communication between students and teachers ==

Online communication between teachers and students facilitates the exchange of ideas and [[e-learning]]. Online communication allows students to access learning materials beyond school hours and develop relationships with peers and teachers.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup32/&gt;

=== Benefits ===

The creation of [[Web 2.0]] and [[social networks]] means that knowledge is now [[collective]] and readily available online for students to access and contribute to.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt; Promoting online communication between teachers and students creates opportunities for students to receive feedback and assistance from teachers and peers outside the regular school day and classroom.  Student can e-mail or post questions, add their opinions to peer-discussions, and check official websites for pertinent information.

Through online learning communities of teachers and peers, students can build relationships with other users and establish a sense of both [[connectedness]] and belonging.  Some students, who are less likely to participate in face-to discussions, are more likely to participate in [[online discussion]]s and activities.  This online communication enhances the strength of the relationships between students and both their peers and teachers.

=== Challenges ===

Student can demonstrate [[antipathy]] towards online communication or peer [[interdependency]] in internet forums.  In order to be productive, online communication between students and teachers requires [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[interactivity]], common expectations and shared goals.  Some students expect teachers to be on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, placing unreasonable expectations upon teachers.&lt;ref name=sup28/&gt; In addition, most students spend participate in online communication from home, which means that parent's help is often required, but may not be available.  Finally, students may lack the technical skills or access to the technology necessary to involve themselves in online communication.

=== Role of teachers ===

Teachers have great responsibility in the establishment of online communication and [[communities]] with students, because of their leadership position.  Several of their in-class characteristics must extend into the online environment, such as their ability to guide student behavior and learning.  With online communication, teachers must model and demonstrate appropriate Netiquette throughout their persistent involvement.  Teachers should also encourage their classes to evolve into [[learning communities]] in which group processes have the power to influence the behavior of individuals.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt; These online environments should foster a sense of [[openness]], friendliness, and [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], so that [[problem solving]] becomes a group function.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup34/&gt;

=== Examples ===

Teachers and students can e-mail questions and answers to each other about course content and assignments.  Schools and teachers can maintain official websites with important information about events, assignments, and resources that students can utilize outside class.&lt;ref name=sup25/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup33/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup45/&gt;

Both students and teachers can post messages in online forums as a part of homework assignments.  In this way they can present different points of view that they don't have any chance to present in the classroom.

Online [[study group]]s  allow students to maintain relationships with their peers from a distance.  These study groups can be created within a classroom’s [[Social-networking sites|social networking site]], allowing users to connect with each other directly, beyond typical chat rooms and forums.

Teachers can develop [[virtual tour]]s, [[virtual education]], and virtual learning environment for their students in [[Multi-User Virtual Environment|multi-user virtual environment]]s (MUVE).

== Technology and tools ==

The most widely used online communication tool is e-mail between teachers, which provides opportunities for asynchronous communication, instantaneous distribution to a mass audience, mobile access, and file exchange.&lt;ref name=sup39/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup40/&gt;  Teacher-created websites provide online access to administrative information, calendars, [[Hyperlink|link]]s, [[blog]]s, etc.  Internet forums allow learners and teachers to articulate ideas, give and receive feedback, reflect on the perspectives of others, and receive clarification of concepts.&lt;ref name=sup37/&gt;  [[List of social networking websites|social networking site]]s are used for focused and open communication between users.  Blogs allow individuals to express their ideas in greater detail and with [[multimedia]].

===Course Management Systems (CMS)===
{{See also|Learning management system|Virtual learning environment}}

Various course management systems are designed specifically for facilitating online communication in education.  Effective course management software tends to include more information, widgets, functions, and customization options than teacher-created websites.

Most course management systems include:
* class information: calendar, [[syllabus]], details of prerequisites, assessment information, and a [[FAQ]]
* a notice board with up-to-date course information
* learning materials: course content, copies of visual aids, reading materials and links to community resources
* assessment opportunities: [[self-assessment]], [[Self- and Peer-Assessment|peer-assessment]], and formal assessment
* communication support: e-mail, [[threaded discussion]]s, and a chat room
* differentiated access rights for teachers, administrators, and students
* document authoring tools
* administrative tools:  student [[Tracking (education)|tracking]] capabilities, [[statistics]], and [[report]]s

Notable CMS Software include:
&lt;!--Entries should have a Wikipedia article, based on multiple independent sources.--&gt;
* [[Chamilo]]
* [[Claroline]]
* [[eFront]]
* [[ILIAS]]
* [[JoomlaLMS]] (a LMS based on Joomla platform)
* [[LAMS]] (Learning Activity Management System)
* [[Moodle]]
* [[Sakai Project|Sakai]]

[[File:The optical system of the ELT showing the location of the mirrors (no annotation).jpg|thumb|300px|The optical system of the [[European Extremely Large Telescope|ELT]] showing the location of the mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESO Awards ELT Sensor Contract to Teledyne e2v|url=https://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann17027/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Optical engineering''' is the field of study that focuses on applications of [[optics]]. Optical engineers design components of [[optical instrument]]s such as [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[microscope]]s, [[telescope]]s, and other equipment that utilizes the properties of [[light]]. Other devices include optical sensors and measurement systems, [[laser]]s, [[fiber optic communication]] systems, [[optical disc]] systems (e.g. [[CD]], [[DVD]]), etc. 

Because optical engineers want to design and build devices that make light do something useful, they must understand and apply the science of optics in substantial detail, in order to know what is physically possible to achieve ([[physics]] and [[chemistry]]). However, they also must know what is practical in terms of available technology, materials, costs, design methods, etc.  As with other fields of engineering, [[computer]]s are important to many (perhaps most) optical engineers. They are used with instruments, for simulation, in design, and for many other applications. Engineers often use general computer tools such as [[spreadsheet]]s and [[programming language]]s, and they make frequent use of specialized optical software designed specifically for their field.

Optical engineering [[metrology]] uses optical methods to measure micro-vibrations with instruments like the laser speckle interferometer or to measure the properties of the various masses with instruments measuring [[refraction]].

It was published on 5 January 2012 by Oxford University Press, and contains 31 academic papers. Oakley defines pathological altruism as "altruism in which attempts to promote the welfare of others instead result in unanticipated harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taranto |first=James |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324688404578545523824389986 |title=Best of the Web Today: Pathological Altruism |work=Wall Street Journal |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The book comprises a collection of essays which discuss negative aspects of [[altruism]] and [[empathy]] towards others, such as when altruism hurts the altruist, is taken to an unhealthy extreme, or causes more harm than good. Examples given include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid. It is considered the first book to explore negative aspects of [[altruism]] and empathy.&lt;ref name=oup&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199738571.do |title=Pathological Altruism: Hardback: Barbara Oakley |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Oakley, [[anorexia]], supporting addictions of other people ([[codependency]]), animal hoarding, depression, guilt and self-righteousness can be pathological altruism. Oakley has also stated that suicide bombings and genocides can be caused by pathological altruism, when perpetrators of these acts believe they are behaving altruistically towards those who share their ideology.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Habash |first=Gabe |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/tip-sheet/article/49893-when-kindness-attacks-a-q-a-with-barbara-oakley.html |title=When Kindness Attacks: A Q&amp;A with Barbara Oakley |work=Publishersweekly.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
    
Oakley further states that some people are naturally "hypersensitive" or they have an excessive desire to "help" others. According to Oakley, such people are convinced that they are helping others without considering the practical results of their "help".&lt;ref name="publishersweekly1"/&gt;

==Reviews==
The book was widely reviewed, including reviews in the ''New Scientist'',&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128290-300-the-dark-side-of-altruism/ |title=The dark side of altruism |work=New Scientist |date=2011-09-07 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Independent''.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/are-we-killing-people-with-kindness-6256124.html |title=Are we killing people with kindness?|work=The Independent |date=2011-11-06 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nursing Standard'' said "I recommend this book to health professionals looking for a deeper understanding of altruism and its motivation. The arguments are clear and scholarly, and supported by a wealth of references."&lt;ref name=oup/&gt;

Writing in ''The New York Times'', Natalie Angier called book a "scholarly yet surprisingly sprightly volume". She wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;pathological altruism is not limited to showcase acts of self-sacrifice... The book is the first comprehensive treatment of the idea that when ostensibly generous 'how can I help you?' behavior is taken to extremes, misapplied or stridently rhapsodized, it can become unhelpful, unproductive and even destructive. Selflessness gone awry may play a role in a broad variety of disorders, including anorexia and animal hoarding, women who put up with abusive partners and men who abide alcoholic ones. Because a certain degree of selfless behavior is essential to the smooth performance of any human group, selflessness run amok can crop up in political contexts. It fosters the exhilarating sensation of righteous indignation, the belief in the purity of your team and your cause and the perfidiousness of all competing teams and causes.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=The Pathological Altruist Gives Till Someone Hurts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/04angier.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Main article|Pioneer Venus Orbiter|Pioneer Venus Multiprobe}}

[[File:Venuspioneeruv.jpg|thumb|Cloud structure in [[Atmosphere of Venus|the Venusian atmosphere]] in 1979, revealed by ultraviolet observations by [[Pioneer Venus Orbiter]]]]
The '''Pioneer Venus project''' was part of the [[Pioneer program]] consisting of two spacecraft, the [[Pioneer Venus Orbiter]] and the [[Pioneer Venus Multiprobe]], launched to [[Venus]] in 1978. The program was managed by [[NASA]]'s [[Ames Research Center]]. An official Ames documentary film titled "Venus Pioneers" is visible on George Van Valkenburg's YouTube Channel. 

The Pioneer Venus Orbiter entered orbit around Venus on December 4, 1978, and performed observations to characterize the [[Atmosphere of Venus|atmosphere]] and surface of Venus. It continued to transmit data until October 1992.

The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe deployed four small probes into the Venusian atmosphere on December 9, 1978. All four probes transmitted data throughout their descent to the surface. One probe survived landing and transmitted data from the surface for over an hour.

==Overview==
The Pioneer mission consisted of two components, launched separately: an orbiter and a multiprobe.
 
===Orbiter===
{{main article|Pioneer Venus Orbiter}}
The orbiter was launched on 20 May 1978 with an Atlas-Centaur rocket. The orbiter's mass was {{convert|517|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/pioneer_venus.html |title=Pioneer Venus Project Information |work=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center |accessdate=2016-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was inserted into an elliptical orbit around Venus on December 4, 1978. It carried 17 experiments (with a total mass of 45&amp;nbsp;kg):&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; 
*a cloud photopolarimeter to measure the vertical distribution of the clouds 
*a surface radar mapper to determine topography and surface characteristics 
*an infrared radiometer to measure IR emissions from the Venus atmosphere 
*an airglow ultraviolet spectrometer to measure scattered and emitted UV light 
*a neutral mass [[spectrometer]] to determine the composition of the upper atmosphere 
*a [[solar wind]] plasma analyzer to measure properties of the solar wind 
*a [[magnetometer]] to characterize the magnetic field at Venus 
*an electric field detector to study the solar wind and its interactions 
*an electron temperature probe to study the thermal properties of the [[ionosphere]] 
*an ion [[mass spectrometer]] to characterize the ionospheric ion population 
*a charged particle retarding potential analyzer to study ionospheric particles 
*two radio science experiments to determine the gravity field of Venus 
*a radio occultation experiment to characterize the atmosphere 
*an atmospheric drag experiment to study the upper atmosphere 
*a radio science atmospheric and solar wind turbulence experiment 
*a gamma ray burst detector to record [[gamma-ray burst]] events

In May 1992 the orbiter began the final phase of its mission, in which the periapsis was held between 150 and 250&amp;nbsp;km until the fuel ran out and atmospheric entry destroyed the spacecraft in August 1992.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;

===Multiprobe===
{{main article|Pioneer Venus Multiprobe}}
The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe was launched on August 8, 1978 on an Atlas-Centaur rocket. It consisted of a 290&amp;nbsp;kg [[Satellite bus|bus]] which carried one large (315&amp;nbsp;kg) and three small atmospheric probes.  The large probe was released on November 16, 1978 and the three small probes on November 20. All four probes entered the Venus atmosphere on December 9, followed by the bus.

The Pioneer Venus large probe was about 1.5 m in diameter and equipped with 7 science experiments. After deceleration from initial atmospheric entry at about 11.5&amp;nbsp;km/s, a parachute was deployed at 47&amp;nbsp;km altitude.  The science experiments were:&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; 
*a neutral [[mass spectrometer]] to measure the atmospheric composition 
*a [[gas chromatograph]] to measure the atmospheric composition 
*a [[Radiant flux|solar flux radiometer]] to measure solar flux penetration in the atmosphere 
*an infrared radiometer to measure distribution of infrared radiation 
*a cloud particle size spectrometer to measure particle size and shape 
*a [[nephelometer]] to search for cloud particles 
*temperature, pressure, and acceleration sensors

The three small probes were identical to each other, 0.8 m in diameter and 90&amp;nbsp;kg each small probe.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; The small probes were each targeted at different parts of the planet;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/pvprobes.html Pioneer Venus Probes]. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  They had no parachutes and the aeroshells did not separate from the probe.

The Pioneer Venus [[Satellite bus|bus]] also carried two experiments, a neutral [[mass spectrometer]] and an ion mass spectrometer to study the composition of the atmosphere. With no heat shield or parachute, the bus made measurements only to about 110&amp;nbsp;km altitude before burning up.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;

'''Planning cultures''' are the differing customs and practices in the profession of [[Urban planning|urban and regional planning]] that exist around the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Planning Cultures|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-95134-8|editor-last=Sanyal|editor-first=Bishwapriya|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Planning cultures in transition|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discourse, models, and styles of communication in planning are adapted to the various local conditions of each community such that planning approaches from one part of the world are not necessarily transferrable to other parts of the globe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Planning culture can refer to how planning professionals undertake their practice in a given location, where they are "affected by both individual and collectively shared cognitive frames" that shape their view of the world. Planners, as stated by Simone Abram, are "constantly in the process of actually producing culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10493875|title=Culture and Planning|last=Abram|first=Simone|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-1-4094-3506-8|location=Farnham, GB|pages=137|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of planning culture also encompasses how planning actually unfolds within a community, as shaped by its culture and influenced by its people. Differing cultural contexts produce different planning and policy responses to issues "bound to specific local (cultural) contexts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knieling|first=Joerg|last2=Othengrafen|first2=Frank|title=Planning Culture—A Concept to Explain the Evolution of Planning Policies and Processes in Europe?|journal=European Planning Studies|volume=23|issue=11|pages=2134|doi=10.1080/09654313.2015.1018404|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of planning cultures include those specific to different countries, regions, and parts of the globe, as well as differing cultures that exist within the same location, such as [[indigenous planning]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.tandfebooks.com/isbn/9781315605647|title=Reshaping Planning with Culture|doi=10.4324/9781315605647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, planning cultures evolved throughout the 20th century from a state-centred attempt at city beautification toward a more collaborative process involving the public. This differs depending on local culture; however, as planning in some locations has remained a top-down process where plans are prescribed by senior government (for example, in China).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Planning culture requires treatment of different local circumstances and as such, varies around the world. In Canada, planning culture has evolved from its roots influenced by town planning in Great Britain to become a values-based political process that promotes public involvement in an attempt to give agency to various groups,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Reader in Canadian Planning: Linking Theory and Practice|last=Grant|first=Jill|publisher=Thomson Nelson|year=2008|isbn=978-0-17-610357-6|location=Toronto|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although social inequalities and colonial legacies are still largely present.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sandercock|first=Leonie|date=2004-03-01|title=Commentary: indigenous planning and the burden of colonialism|journal=Planning Theory &amp; Practice|volume=5|issue=1|pages=118–124|doi=10.1080/1464935042000204240|issn=1464-9357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous planning culture, which has evolved over hundreds to thousands of years,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; is another distinct planning culture, within which exists distinct, fluid, and evolving planning cultures that are unique to land, history, and peoples. Today, the reclamation of Indigenous planning cultures has planning in many countries exploring how non-Indigenous and Indigenous planners can work collaboratively toward a reconciliatory, culturally-responsive, and respectful process.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uturn2.cyansolutions.com/cip/plan-canada/summer2013/|title=Plan Canada – Summer 2013|website=uturn2.cyansolutions.com|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning cultures operate within the institutions of their locations. As such, planning cultures play out within the institutional spheres of society, spheres which are consistently evolving and changing in a dynamic response to cultural stimuli.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Educational institutions across the world differ in their approach to planning, contributing toward the formation of distinct planning cultures and demonstrating transformations within planning cultures through changing subject matter and emphases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Development of planning cultures ==
Planning cultures evolved alongside processes of industrialization and the advancement of societies. Prior to [[World War II]], planning was considered a [[City Beautiful movement|city beautification movement]] proposed by architects and politicians.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cities of tomorrow: An intellectual history of urban planning and design since 1880|last=Hall|first=Peter|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1-118-45647-7|edition=4th|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, with industrialization, planning was conceived as an attempt to provide city leaders with a framework to develop new neighbourhoods and towns outside of the [[City centre|urban core]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After World War II, planning expanded from beautification to include many social elements such as economy, history, religion, and public policy. It became understood that such social factors influence how urban infrastructure develops.
[[File:Local, state, regional, and federal stakeholders work together in planning the future farmers markets and downtown. (19153622646).jpg|thumb|Increasingly, planning cultures are involving the general public throughout the planning process.]]
The formative years for planning cultures were the 1940s and 1950s, during a global period of rebuilding after World War II. Planning cultures emerged from planning practices as the public became increasingly aware of the impacts of planning. During this period, planners also started to take into consideration the impacts of planning practices on the public. Efforts began to shift from building functional and aesthetic architecture, to analytical and rational development approaches for resolving issues faced by a city or region.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The planning culture in many countries has shifted from a design-centric practice led by a small group of professionals to a much broader social activity involving the general public throughout the process.

Starting in the 1960s, the traditional “top-down” and “[[State-centered theory|state-centered]]” planning paradigm was criticized as being static and unresponsive in dealing with complex issues in local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanyal|first=B|title=From the Benevolent to the Evil State,|journal=Cooperative Autonomy: the Dialectic of State-NGO Ralationship in Developing Counties|volume=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, planning practice in many industrialized nations began to shift towards a more “bottom-up” and “[[People-centered development|people-centered]]” process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolan|first=R|last2=S|title=Emerging Views of Planning,|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Planners|volume=33 |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this transitional period, planning evolved from its original object of providing solutions for specific issues to a more comprehensive goal of addressing socioeconomic challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Private Voluntary Organizations as Agents of Development|last=Gorman|first=R.F.|publisher=West View Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was an attempt to explore more efficient, flexible, and accountable options for  complex problems. As planning culture in industrialized states became more inclusive and aware of issues related to the environment, social equality, multiculturalism, and other non-spatial issues, planners felt it necessary to reflect upon their professional views in order to engage with general public and to search common ground across public in different background and interest groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybczynski|first=W.|title=Where Have All the Planners Gone?|journal=The Profession of City Planning: Change, Image and Challenge|volume=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, some developing countries maintained their “top-down” paradigm in planning, such as China, Cuba, and Iran, where planning still followed comprehensive national strategies. Since the 1980s, planning practices in those and other developing counties have begun to take different directions{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

== Comparing international planning cultures ==
Planning processes and results are highly subject to political influences and institutional structures, which vary significantly around the world. The process of planning involves many stakeholders, although primarily, it is overseen and approved by governments. As such, the largest influences on planning culture are the variables of: constitutional government structures ([[unitary state]]s, [[Federation|federal states]], [[multinational state]]s), economic structure ([[Market economy|market economies]], those in transition from [[Planned economy|command economies]]), the pace of urban population growth, political culture (involvement of [[civil society]], role of media, competitiveness among parties, openness of political process), and the level of [[economic development]]. In all cases, planning institutions are constantly evolving themselves to adapt to new needs and changes. One such broad shift is the embracing of market-led development, where planning institutions now facilitate market forces in an entrepreneurial fashion instead of restraining them.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freidmann|first=John|year=2005|title=Globalization and the emerging culture of planning|journal=Progress in Planning|volume=64|pages=183–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several examples of planning cultures are presented below, in alphabetical order by country name.

=== Planning culture in Canada ===
[[File:BC blank.png|thumb|Regional districts in the province of British Columbia are one example of a regional scale at which some planning processes are undertaken in Canada.]]
Planning culture in Canada is inherently value-laden, and cultural and moral values are important aspects of this practice.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedmann|first=John|date=2008-12-01|title=The Uses of Planning Theory A Bibliographic Essay|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/28/2/247|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=247–257|doi=10.1177/0739456X08325220|issn=0739-456X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian planning culture has been influenced by the planning practices of [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|Great Britain]], who partly settled Canada, and by the United States, Canada's neighbour to the South.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The culture of planning in Canada has retained its unique identity by focusing on community planning, while Great Britain focuses on [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|town planning]], and the United States on [[Urban planning in the United States|urban planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning canadian communities: An introduction to the principles, practice and participants|last=Hodge|first=Gerald|publisher=Thomson Nelson|year=2003|isbn=978-0-17-650982-8|edition=4|location=Scarborough|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's legacy as a sparsely populated nation has led to a planning culture that centres on regional planning as a way of tackling disparities between rural and urban areas.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning Canadian Regions|last=Hodge|first=Gerald|last2=Robinson|first2=Ira|publisher=UBC Press|year=2001|isbn=0-7748-0851-9|location=Vancouver|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict of Canada's regional planning culture lies in the fact that a region can be defined in many different ways. For example, a [[region]] could be a large area centred around an urban area, a watershed area, or as an area based on the valley section between mountains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Combined with the regional approach to planning, the diverse and multicultural nature of the Canadian population has led to some challenges in the way that planning is conducted in Canada.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jill Grant explains that a potential solution to these conflicts that has been adopted by Canadian planners is a planning culture where the professional works proactively to anticipate conflicts and mitigate them before they reach a tipping point.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This flexible and proactive approach is useful in Canadian planning culture because it helps balance the needs of different groups living, an often very diverse geographic, political, and social, region to come to positive solutions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Planning practice is influenced by politics, and in Canada social justice has been incorporated into progressive planning cultures since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Social justice in planning has focused on enabling typically under-resourced groups, such as the poor. The legacy of planning in Canada as a form of social justice has permeated to planning schools, including the [[School of Community and Regional Planning]] at the University of British Columbia, where agency, [[democratization]], and [[sustainability]] are declared to be important values of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scarp.ubc.ca/mission-and-goals|title=Mission and Goals {{!}} SCARP {{!}} UBC School of Community and Regional Planning|website=scarp.ubc.ca|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory planning culture in Canada is in part inspired by Porto Alegre's [[Participatory budgeting|participatory budget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boaventura de Sousa|first=Santos|year=1998|title=Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre: Toward a Redistributive Democracy|journal=Politics &amp; Society|volume=26|issue=4|pages=461|doi=10.1177/0032329298026004003|issn=0032-3292}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has led to a culture of [[Consensus decision-making|consensus-building]], [[collaboration]], and community agency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Canada's planning culture is rife with colonial legacies and inequalities and this is not forgotten in today's planning culture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Today, planning culture in Canada has evolved to a values-based practice embedded within the political realm that attempts to give agency to various groups by promoting collaboration and conflict resolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Planning culture in China ===
{{Main|Urban planning in China}}
[[File:Shanghai Puxi in the Morning.jpg|thumb|The city of Shanghai, China.]]
In [[China]], planning activities and planning bureaucracies have expanded significantly in recent decades, with over 60,000 practicing planners in what is now a well-reputed profession.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Local development and land use decisions are guided by socio-economic plans developed by senior governments, which in turn are aligned with national 5-year plans. The [[Ministry of Land and Resources of the People's Republic of China|State Land Administration Bureau]] is a vertically-integrated organization with branches in every major city that oversees the allocation of land uses and coordinates major projects along with the [[Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development|Ministry of Construction and the Planning Bureau]]. This is indicative of planning culture in China, which is characterized by centralization of decision making: for example, Civic Mayors are appointed by higher levels of government. Planning is largely seen as a responsibility of government, with little involvement from civil society. Citizens who take issue with planning decisions may sue the local government, file a petition, or engage in public demonstration; however, these actions are largely futile. As a result, planners have significant latitude to implement their ideas without inhibition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Recently; however, media outlets have begun to offer critical perspectives on planning decisions.

=== Planning culture in India ===
Relative to China, planning culture in [[India]] is characterized by jurisdictional and administrative autonomy. The civil service in charge of planning is accountable to, yet separate from, the political sphere. Five-year national economic plans guide the direction of development and land use planning at the state and municipal level. With the quadrupling of urban populations over the past 50 years, planning is challenged to keep up with such rapid [[urbanization]]. As a result, civil society is still finding its role in balancing planning actors with increasing influence for historically marginalized groups. While planning in India is seen as a vehicle by which to organize and bring significant benefits to society, the planning culture is marred by a socio-economic disconnect between planners and the populations they serve, a highly bureaucratic administration, and the continued marginalization of vast swathes of the urban poor who often live without land rights.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Planning culture in Japan ===
In [[Japan]], planning was a large part of the dynastic society throughout the known recent history of Japan. During successive heredity an Emperor or the appointed Shogun had the authority to provide centralized planning for the areas of the country under their control. Individual provinces would report to the authority and power of the central government. After the [[Meiji Restoration]] the government developed separated functions and planning functions largely centralized on a regional basis. During the 1990s, local governments were empowered to begin producing urban development Master Plans to guide long-term changes in their jurisdictions. While municipalities were still tied financially to the central government, this change in planning was seen as a major innovation, and one that created a planning culture with increased opportunities for localized public participation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Planning culture in Russia ===
In [[Russia]], prior to the late 1980s, planning was highly centralized and plans were not publicly available. 30-year plans and designs for most areas were produced in government institutes in the largest cities, far removed from the realities where they were to be applied.  After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], local governments were rapidly given increased planning responsibility, but did not yet have the tools and structure in place to effectively regulate land use. Significant political, societal, and economic changes in that period of transition further complicated the challenges faced by local planning authorities. Attention was given to addressing these immediate needs, and less to the long-range planning tasks of the Soviet era.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Planning culture in South Africa ===
[[File:Townships of Cape Town.jpg|thumb|Informal settlements in Cape Town, South Africa.]]
In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], including the country of [[South Africa]], urban growth rates remain some of the highest in the world. A severe lack of institutional capacity and financial resources characterizes the context of planning challenges in sub-Saharan states. The planning culture is characterized by a process that focuses in the areas inhabited by urban elites, while the vast majority of urban populations live in informal and squatter settlements, which are technically illegal and beyond the official realm of planning jurisdiction. However, local and national authorities are increasingly directing attention to such settlements, and, combined with foreign financial support, are improving basic infrastructure needs. The precarious nature of these unofficial residential lands limits the ability of residents to obtain services and raise issues with local planning administrations, further maintaining their marginalization. Enforcement of regulations, public participation, and plan execution are notably weak, while nepotism is strong, resulting in much urban development taking place outside of official planning processes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Studies of planning culture have tended to focus on national scales for comparative analysis; however, a need has been identified to focus on the contextual factors that differentiate planning cultures at the local level. Further research is also needed to understand the underlying forces that affect the core values of planning cultures; while "planning artifacts", such as institutional planning structures, are evident and can be easily compared, intangible aspects of the "social environment" require more thorough examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Othengrafen|first=Frank|last2=Reimer|first2=Mario|date=2013|title=The embeddedness of planning in cultural contexts: theoretical foundations for the analysis of dynamic planning cultures|journal=Environment and Planning A|volume=45|pages=1269–1284|doi=10.1068/a45131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indigenous planning cultures ==
Indigenous planning culture is an approach to planning that is both by and for indigenous peoples and is a practice that has evolved over hundreds to thousands of years.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mqup.ca/reclaiming-indigenous-planning-products-9780773541948.php|title=Reclaiming Indigenous Planning {{!}} McGill-Queen’s University Press|website=www.mqup.ca|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its cultural practice is defined by the sets of traditional knowledges, customs, practices, and cultural identities that are unique to the approximately 350 [[Indigenous peoples]] worldwide.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Indigenous [[world view]]s ground Indigenous planning cultures, that have evolved and been sustained through time.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Indigenous planning|Indigenous Planning]] is defined by Dr. Theodore (Ted) Jojola as, "both an approach to community planning and an ideological movement. What distinguishes indigenous planning from mainstream practice is its reformulation of planning approaches in a manner that incorporates 'traditional' knowledge and cultural identity. Key to the process is the acknowledgement of an indigenous world-view, which not only serves to unite it philosophically, but also to distinguish it from neighbouring, non land-based communities." &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Indigenous+planning--an+emerging+context.-a0185031904|title=Indigenous planning--an emerging context. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars, practitioners, and community leaders see Indigenous planning as a cultural practice of reclaiming traditional and reformulating mainstream planning approaches that are respectful, responsive to, and owned by Indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Planning cultures in transition: institutional transformation ==
According to Sanyal, (p.xxi)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "planning cultures are cultures of planning practice. They are the collective [[Ethos (disambiguation)|ethos]] and dominant attitudes of professional planners toward the appropriate roles of the state, market forces, and civil society in urban, regional, and national development." As Reimer notes, this ethos refers to the "basic ideas, traditions, and values of planning professionals."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Reimer further suggests that planning cultures are "complex and multi-dimensional institutional matrices comprising formal and informal institutional spheres that need to adapt to ever-changing external and internal circumstances."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this context, planning cultures operate in an institutional setting and any evolution of a planning culture must contend with a "persisting institutional stability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riemer|first=Mario|year=2013|title=Planning Cultures in Transition: Sustainability Management and Institutional Change in Spatial Planning|url=http://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability|journal=sustainability|volume=5|pages=4653–4673|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reimer evaluates planning cultures as "an analytical concept (and not as a normative paradigm in theory and practice)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Planning is embedded and operates in specific cultural contexts, subject to changing planning cultures. This change can be seen as it plays out in institutional spheres, a form of [[social transformation]]. Institutional change can be theorized as a process comprising six stages: equilibrium, shock event, deinstitutionalization, preinstitutionalization, theorization, diffusion, and reinstitutionalization.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, R.; Suddaby, R.; Hinings, C.R. Theorizing change: The role of professional associations in the transformation of institutionalized fields. Acad. Manage. J. 2002, 1, 58–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transitions in planning cultures can also be seen in the style and focus of education programs for new planners. Traditionally, planning was closely aligned with architecture and engineering; this is evidenced in planning programs in continental Europe, which emphasize [[urban design]] and land use planning. In North America, the United Kingdom, and select European countries, the breadth of planning subject matter in education has expanded and directs more attention to environmental sustainability and social justice, while also focusing on built form and land regulation.  Planning programs are evolving to train planners to be more creative, innovative, and [[Collaborative planning|collaborative]]. Such skills are essential to meet the increasing challenges faced by planning, for which traditional methods will not suffice.  In unprecedented, uncertain, and unstable times, adaptation of planning cultures is seen as key to their efficacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The foundation of Anglo-American planning values has long been guided by a yearning to implement utopian ideals.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This starts with planning institutions where academics and practitioners practice, where institutional reform is a constant focus. By reforming institutions, planners believe they can improve core issues in the practice and process of planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Zack|date=2013|title=Rethinking planning culture: a new institutionalist approach|journal=The Town Planning Review|volume=84.6|pages=683–702|doi=10.3828/tpr.2013.36}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2017}}

== History and context ==

[[Electromagnetic propulsion]] designs which operate on the principle of [[reaction mass]] have been around since the start of the 20th century. In the 1960s, extensive research was conducted on two designs which emit high-velocity ionized gases in similar ways: [[ion thruster]]s that convert propellant to ions and accelerate and eject them via [[electric potential]]s, and [[plasma propulsion engine|plasma thrusters]] that convert propellant to plasma ions and accelerate and eject them via [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] currents. In the latter, plasma can be generated from an intense source of microwave or other [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] (RF) energy, and in combination with a resonant cavity, can be tuned to resonate at a precise frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A low-propellant space drive has long been a goal for space exploration, since the propellant is dead weight that must be lifted and accelerated with the ship all the way from launch until the moment it is used (see [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]]). [[Gravity assist]]s, [[solar sail]]s, and [[beam-powered propulsion]] from a spacecraft-remote location such as the ground or in orbit, are useful because they allow a ship to gain speed without propellant. However, some of these methods do not work in deep space. Shining a light out of the ship provides a small force from [[radiation pressure]], i.e., using photons as a form of propellant, but the force is far too weak, for a given amount of input power, to be useful in practice.

A true zero-propellant drive is widely believed to be impossible, but if it existed, it could potentially be used for travel in many environments including deep space. Thus, such drives are a popular concept in science fiction, and their improbability contributes to enthusiasm for exploring such designs.&lt;ref name="Wired 2009"&gt;{{cite web

Conventional [[rocket engine]]s expel [[propellant]], such as when ships move masses of water, aircraft move masses of air, or rockets expel exhaust. A drive which does not expel propellant in order to produce a [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]], providing thrust while being a [[closed system]] with no external interaction, would be a [[reactionless drive]]. Such a drive would violate the [[conservation of momentum]] and [[Newton's third law]], leading many physicists to believe it to be impossible, labelling the idea [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Nat Geo Peer review" /&gt; On the other hand, a drive that interacts with an external [[Field (physics)|field]] would be part of an [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open system]], [[Field propulsion|propellantless]] but not reactionless, like a sail catching and redirecting existing winds to move a ship.

The first proposal for an RF resonant cavity thruster came from British engineer Roger Shawyer in 2001.  He invented a design with a conical cavity, calling it the EmDrive.  Guido Fetta later built the Cannae Drive based on Shawyer's concept&lt;ref name="AW&amp;ST 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired 2013" /&gt; a resonant thruster with a pillbox-shaped cavity.
Since 2008, a few physicists have tested their own models, trying to confirm results claimed by Shawyer and Fetta.  Juan Yang at [[Xi'an]]'s [[Northwestern Polytechnical University]] (NWPU) initially reported thrust from a model they built,&lt;ref name="Wired 2008"&gt;{{cite web

Media coverage of experiments using these designs has been controversial and polarized. The EmDrive first drew attention, both credulous and dismissive, when ''[[New Scientist]]'' wrote about it as an "impossible" drive in 2006.&lt;ref name="New Scientist blog" /&gt; Media outlets were later criticised for misleading claims that a resonant cavity thruster had been "validated by NASA"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, responding to the ''New Scientist'' piece, mathematical physicist [[John C.

Physicists are trained to use certain fundamental principles to analyse a problem and this claim clearly flouted one of them{{nbsp}}... The Shawyer drive is as impossible as perpetual motion. Relativistic conservation of momentum has been understood for a century and dictates that if nothing emerges from Shawyer's device then its centre of mass will not accelerate. It is likely that Shawyer has used an approximation somewhere in his calculations that would have been reasonable if he hadn't then multiplied the result by 50,000. The reason physicists value principles such as conservation of momentum is that they act as a reality check against errors of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This violation of the fundamental principles of physics has drawn criticism from the scientific community, leading to various attempts to explain the apparent or observed thrust. However, to date, there is no acceptance or consensus on how or why these cavities produce thrust if they produce thrust at all.

Attempts to explain the thrust (assuming that there is thrust) generally fall into four categories:&lt;ref name="Forbes ES" /&gt;
* Measurement errors. Most theoretical scientists who have looked at the EmDrive believe this to be the likely case.
* Electromagnetic effects.
* Exhaust not being measured or taken into account.
* Speculation that our current understanding of the laws of physics are completely wrong.

=== Measurement errors ===
{{Main|Observational error}}
The simplest and most likely explanation is that any thrust detected is due to [[Observational error|experimental error]] or noise. In all of the experiments set up, a very large amount of energy goes into generating a tiny amount of thrust. When attempting to measure a small signal superimposed on a large signal, the noise from the large signal can obscure the small signal and give incorrect results. The strongest early result, from Yang's group in China, was later reported to be caused by an experimental error.&lt;ref name="Yang 2016"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Shift in center of gravity due to thermal effects ===
[[File:IR imagery of RF amplifier and heat sink.png|thumb|128px|right|Infrared image showing heating of the heat sink]]
The largest error source is believed to come from the [[thermal expansion]] of the thruster's [[heat sink]]; as it expands this would lead to a change in the centre of gravity causing the resonant cavity to move. White's team attempted to model the thermal effect on the overall displacement by using a superposition of the displacements caused by "thermal effects" and "impulsive thrust" with White saying "That was the thing we worked the hardest to understand and put in a box". Despite these efforts, White's team were unable to fully account for the thermal expansion. In an interview with ''Aerospace America'', White comments that "although maybe we put a little bit of a pencil mark through [thermal errors]... they are certainly not black-Sharpie-crossed-out."&lt;ref name="Hadhazy 2016" /&gt;

Their method of accounting for thermal effects has been criticized by Millis and Davies, who highlight that there is a lack of both mathematical and empirical detail to justify the assumptions made about those effects.  For example, they do not provide data on temperature measurement over time compared to device displacement. The paper includes a graphical chart, but it is based on [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] assumptions about what the shapes of the "impulsive thrust" and "thermal effects" should be, and how those signals will superimpose. The model further assumes all noise to be thermal and does not include other effects such as interaction with the chamber wall, power lead forces, and tilting. Because the Eagleworks paper has no explicit model for thrust to compare with the observations, it is ultimately subjective, and its data can be interpreted in more than one way. The Eagleworks test, therefore, does not conclusively show a thrust effect, but cannot rule it out either.&lt;ref name="TZF 2016" /&gt;

White suggested future experiments could run on a [[Cavendish balance]]. In such a setup, the thruster could rotate out to much larger angular displacements, letting a thrust (if present) dominate any possible thermal effects. Testing a device in space would also eliminate the center-of-gravity issue.
&lt;ref name="Hadhazy 2016" /&gt;

{{clear}}
=== Electromagnetic interaction with the vacuum chamber's wall ===
Another source of error could have arisen from electromagnetic interaction with the walls of the vacuum chamber.&lt;ref name="Hadhazy 2016" /&gt; White argued that any wall interaction could only be the result of a well-formed resonance coupling between the device and wall and that the high frequency used imply the chances of this would be highly dependent on the device's geometry. As components get warmer due to thermal expansion, the device's geometry changes, shifting the resonance of the cavity. In order to counter this effect and keep the system in optimal resonance conditions, White used a [[phase-locked loop]] system (PLL). Their analysis assumed that using a PLL ruled out significant electromagnetic interaction with the wall.&lt;ref name="Eagleworks AIAA 2016"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Lorentz force from power leads ===
Another potential source of error was a [[Lorentz force]] arising from power leads. Many previous experiments used cups with [[Galinstan]] metal alloy, which is liquid at room temperature, to supply electrical power to the device in lieu of solid wires. [[Martin Tajmar]] and his graduate student Fiedler characterized and attempted to quantify possible sources of error in their experiment at [[Dresden University of Technology]]. They ran multiple tests on their experimental setup, including measurements of the force along different axes with respect to the power supply current. While eliminating or accounting for many other sources of error in previous experiments, such as replacing a [[magnetic damping]] mechanism with an oil damper, less efficient but significantly less interacting with electromagnetic field, the study remained inconclusive as to the effects of electromagnetic interaction with the apparatus' power feed, at the same time noting it as possibly the most significant source of noise.&lt;ref name="Tajmar2015"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; White's power setup may have been different, but their paper does not state if the connections are all coaxially aligned with the stand's rotation axis, which would be required to minimize errors from Lorentz forces, and it gives no data from equivalent tests with power into a dummy load so these influences can be compared with those seen in the Tajmar-Fiedler run.&lt;ref name="TZF 2016" /&gt;

Marc Millis and Eric Davies who ran NASA's previous advanced propulsion project, the [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] have commented that while White used techniques that would be acceptable for checking the electric propulsion of [[Hall thruster]]s, the tests were not sufficient to demonstrate that any new physics effect exists.&lt;ref name="TZF 2016" /&gt;

=== Tests by inventors ===
In 2004, Shawyer reported seven independent positive reviews from experts at [[BAE Systems]], [[Astrium|EADS Astrium]], [[Siemens]] and the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]],&lt;ref name="The Engineer 2004"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these were disputed. In a letter to ''New Scientist'', the then-technical director of EADS Astrium (Shawyer's former employer) denied this: {{quote|I reviewed Roger's work and concluded that both theory and experiment were fatally flawed. Roger was advised that the company had no interest in the device, did not wish to seek patent coverage and in fact did not wish to be associated with it in any way.&lt;ref name="newscientist-astrium-debunk" /&gt;}}

In 2011, Fetta tested a [[superconductor|superconducting]] version of the Cannae drive. The RF resonant cavity was suspended inside a liquid helium-filled [[Vacuum flask|dewar]]. The weight of the cavity was monitored by [[load cell]]s. Fetta theorized that when the device was activated and produced upward thrust, the load cells would detect the thrust as a change in weight. When the drive was energized by sending 10.5&amp;nbsp;watt power pulses of RF power into the resonant cavity, there was, as predicted, a reduction in compressive force on the load cells consistent with thrust of 8–10&amp;nbsp;mN.

None of these results have been published in the scientific literature, or replicated by independent researchers. They have been posted on their inventors' websites.&lt;ref&gt;Page is no longer available, but an archived version as of 2 November 2012 is available at archive.org: [https://web.archive.org/web/20121102082714/http://www.cannae.com/proof-of-concept/experimental-results www.cannae.com/proof-of-concept/experimental-results] (retrieved 11 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Shawyer published an article in ''[[Acta Astronautica]]'', summarising existing tests on the EmDrive. Of seven tests, four produced a measured force in the intended direction and three produced thrust in the opposite direction. Furthermore, in one test, thrust could be produced in either direction by varying the spring constants in the measuring apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; they reported a maximum thrust of 720&amp;nbsp;mN at 2,500&amp;nbsp;W of input power.&lt;ref name="Yang 2014" /&gt; Yang noted that her results were tentative, and said she "[was] not able to discuss her work until more results are published".&lt;ref name="Wired 2013" /&gt; This positive result was over 100x more thrust per input power than any other experiment, and inspired other groups to try to replicate their work.

In a 2014 follow-up experiment (published in 2016), Yang could not reproduce the 2010 observation and suggested it was due to experimental error.&lt;ref name="Yang 2016" /&gt; In that experiment they refined their experimental setup, using a three-wire torsion pendulum to measure thrust, and tested two different power setups. In one trial, the power system was outside the cavity, and they observed a "thrust" of 8–10&amp;nbsp;mN.  In a second trial, the power system was within the cavity, and they measured no such thrust.  Instead they observed an insignificant thrust below their noise threshold of 3&amp;nbsp;mN, fluctuating between ±0.7&amp;nbsp;mN with a measurement uncertainty of 80%, with 230 W of input power.  They concluded that they were unable to measure significant thrust; that "thrust" measured when using external power sources (as in their 2010 experiment) could be noise; and that it was important to use self-contained power systems for these experiments, and more sensitive pendulums with lower [[torsion constant|torsional]] [[stiffness]].&lt;ref name="Yang 2016" /&gt;

==== EmDrive and tapered cavities ====

In July 2014, White reported tentative positive results for evaluating a tapered RF resonant cavity.&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt; Testing was performed using a low-thrust [[torsion pendulum]] able to detect force at the micronewton level within a sealed but unevacuated [[vacuum chamber]] (the [[RF power amplifier]] used an [[electrolytic capacitor]] unable to operate in a hard vacuum).&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt; The experimenters recorded directional thrust immediately upon application of power.

Their first tests of this tapered cavity were conducted at very low power (2% of Shawyer's 2002 experiment). A net mean thrust over five runs was measured at 91.2&amp;nbsp;µN at 17&amp;nbsp;W of input power.&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt; The experiment was criticized for its small data set and for not having been conducted in vacuum, to eliminate thermal air currents.

The group announced a plan to upgrade their equipment to higher power levels, to use vacuum-capable RF amplifiers with power ranges of up to 125&amp;nbsp;W, and to design a new tapered cavity that could be in the 0.1&amp;nbsp;N/kW range. The test article was to be subject to independent [[verification and validation]] at [[Glenn Research Center]], the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and the Johns Hopkins University [[Applied Physics Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBF_20150206" /&gt; {{As of|2016}}, this validation has not happened.&lt;ref&gt;[https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=40959.3320 Topic: EM Drive Developments – related to space flight applications – Thread 8], Nasa Spaceflight Forum, posts by Paul March, 26 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Paul March from Eagleworks made new results public, measured with a torsional pendulum in a hard vacuum: about 50&amp;nbsp;µN with 50&amp;nbsp;W of input power at 5.0×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[torr]].&lt;ref name="NBF_20150206"&gt;{{cite web

They conducted further experiments in vacuum, a set of 18 observations with 40-80W of input power.  They published the results in the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]]'s peer-reviewed ''[[Journal of Propulsion and Power]]'', under the title ''"Measurement of Impulsive Thrust from a Closed Radio-Frequency Cavity in Vacuum"''.  This was released online in November 2016, with print publication in December.&lt;ref name="Eagleworks AIAA 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes peer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired Peer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Motherboard Peer Review" /&gt; The study said that the system was "consistently performing with a thrust-to-power ratio of 1.2±0.1mN/kW", and enumerated many potential sources of error.&lt;ref name="Eagleworks AIAA 2016" /&gt;

The paper suggested that [[pilot-wave theory]] (a controversial, non-mainstream deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics) could explain how the device produces thrust.&lt;ref name="Eagleworks AIAA 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired Peer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Motherboard Peer Review" /&gt; Commenters pointed out that just because a study reporting consistent thrust was published with peer-review does not necessarily mean that the drive functions as claimed.&lt;ref name="Nat Geo Peer review"&gt;{{Cite web

==== Cannae drive ====

White's 2014 tests also evaluated two Cannae drive prototypes.&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt; One had radial slots engraved along the bottom rim of the resonant cavity interior, as required by Fetta's hypothesis to produce thrust;&lt;ref name="Cannae LLC" /&gt; another "null" test article lacked those radial slots. Both drives were equipped with an internal [[dielectric]].&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt; A third test article, the experimental control, had an RF load but no resonant cavity interior. These tests took place at atmospheric pressure.

About the same net thrust was reported for both the device with radial slots and the device without slots. Thrust was not reported for the experimental control. Some considered the positive result for the non-slotted device a possible flaw in the experiment, as the null test device had been expected to produce less or no thrust based upon Fetta's hypothesis of how thrust was produced by the device.&lt;ref name=Powell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ars&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the complete paper, however, White concluded that the test results proved that "thrust production was not dependent upon slotting".&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt;

=== Dresden University of Technology ===

In July 2015, an aerospace research group at the [[Dresden University of Technology]] (TUD) under [[Martin Tajmar]] reported results for an evaluation of an RF resonant tapered cavity similar to the EmDrive.&lt;ref name="Tajmar2015" /&gt; Testing was performed first on a knife-edge [[Weighing scale|beam balance]] able to detect force at the micronewton level, atop an antivibration granite table at ambient air pressure; then on a torsion pendulum with a force resolution of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mN, inside a vacuum chamber at ambient air pressure and in a hard vacuum at {{convert|4e-6|mbar|uPa|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

They used a conventional [[ISM band]] 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz 700 W oven magnetron, and a small cavity with a low Q factor (20 in vacuum tests).  They observed small positive thrusts in the positive direction and negative thrusts in the negative direction, of about 20&amp;nbsp;µN in a hard vacuum.  However, when they rotated the cavity upwards as a "null" configuration, they observed an anomalous thrust of hundreds of micronewtons, significantly larger than the expected result of zero thrust.  This indicated a strong source of noise which they could not identify. This led them to conclude that they could not confirm or refute claims about such a thruster. At the time they considered future experiments with better magnetic shielding, other vacuum tests and improved cavities with higher ''Q'' factors.

In 2018, the TU Dresden research team presented a conference paper summarizing the results from the most recent experiments on their upgraded test rig, which seemed to show that their measured thrust was a result of experimental error from insufficiently shielded components interacting with the earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref name=newscientist2018&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 25 May 2018
| work       = New Scientist
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiments, they measured thrust values consistent with previous experiments, and the thrust reversed appropriately when the thruster was rotated by 180°. However, the team also measured thrust perpendicular to the expected direction when the thruster was rotated by 90°, and did not measure a reduction in thrust when an [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] was used to reduce the power that actually entered the resonant cavity by a factor of 10,000, which they said "clearly indicates that the "thrust" is not coming from the EMDrive but from some electromagnetic interaction." They concluded that "magnetic interaction from not sufficiently shielded cables or thrusters are a major factor that needs to be taken into account for proper μN thrust measurements for these type of devices," and they plan on conducting future tests at higher power and at different frequencies, and with improved shielding and cavity geometry.&lt;ref name=tajmar2018&gt;{{Cite conference

In December 2016, Yue Chen told a reporter at China's ''[[Science and Technology Daily]]'' that his team was testing an EmDrive in orbit, and that they had been funding research in the area for five years. Chen noted that their prototype's thrust was at the "micronewton to millinewton level", which would have to be scaled up to at least 100–1000 millinewtons for a chance of conclusive experimental results. Despite this, he said his goal was to complete validation of the drive, and then to make such technology available in the field of satellite engineering "as quickly as possible".&lt;ref name="ibtimes20161213"&gt;{{cite news

'''Risk parity''' (or '''risk premia parity''') is an approach to investment portfolio management which focuses on allocation of risk, usually defined as volatility, rather than allocation of capital.  The risk parity approach asserts that when asset allocations are adjusted (leveraged or deleveraged) to the same risk level, the risk parity portfolio can achieve a higher [[Sharpe ratio]] and can be more resistant to market downturns than the traditional portfolio.

Roughly speaking, the approach of building a risk parity portfolio is similar to creating a minimum-variance portfolio subject to the constraint that each asset (or asset class, such as bonds, stocks, real estate, etc.) contributes equally to the portfolio overall volatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thierry-roncalli.com/download/erc.pdf|title=On the properties of equally-weighted risk contributions portfolios|last=Sébastien Maillard, Thierry Roncalli, Jérôme Teiletche|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/3114/risk-parity-portfolio-construction|title=Risk Parity portfolio construction|website=quant.stackexchange.com|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk parity can also be a generalized term that denotes a variety of [[investment]] systems and techniques that utilize its principles.&lt;ref name="Peters1"&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Peters|editor1-first=Ed|url=http://www.firstquadrant.com/downloads/2009_02_Balancing_Betas.pdf|format=pdf|title=Balancing Betas: Essential Risk Diversification|journal=First Quadrant Perspective|date=February 2009|volume=6|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of risk parity are applied differently according to the investment style and goals of various financial managers and yield different results.

Some of its theoretical components were developed in the 1950s and 1960s but the first risk parity fund, called the ''[[Bridgewater Associates#All Weather|All Weather]]'' fund, was pioneered in 1996. In recent years many investment companies have begun offering risk parity funds to their clients.  The term, risk parity, came into use in 2005 and was then adopted by the asset management industry. Risk parity can be seen as either a passive or active management strategy.

Interest in the risk parity approach has increased since the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|late 2000s financial crisis]] as the risk parity approach fared better than traditionally constructed portfolios, as well as many hedge funds.&lt;ref name="IPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPE April 2011"/&gt; Some portfolio managers have expressed skepticism about the practical application of the concept and its effectiveness in all types of market conditions&lt;ref name="Missed Op"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson Bianchi Goldberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Robert M.|first2=Stephen W.|last2=Bianchi|first3=Lisa R.|last3=Goldberg|title=Will My Risk Parity Strategy Outperform?|journal=Financial Analysts Journal|date=November–December 2012|doi=10.2469/faj.v68.n6.7|volume=68|issue=6|pages=75–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; but others point to its performance during the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]] as an indication of its potential success.&lt;ref name="Choueifaty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martellini"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Risk Parity C1.pdf|thumb|243px|Comparison of asset and risk allocations]]
Risk parity is a conceptual approach to investing which attempts to provide a lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio [[asset allocation|allocation]] of 60% [[stock]]s and 40% [[bond (finance)|bonds]] which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio (see illustration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top1000funds.com/conversation/2010/03/09/risk-parity/|accessdate=October 18, 2011|publisher=Top 1000 Funds|title=Risk Parity Becomes Bittersweet Flavour|author=Amanda White|date=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maillard"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1271972|accessdate=|last1=Maillard|first1=Sebastien|first2=Thierry|last2=Roncalli|first3=Jerome|last3=Teiletche|title=On the properties of {{Sic|hide=y|equally|-}}weighted risk contributions portfolios|journal=Working Paper| date=September 2008 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1271972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk parity approach attempts to equalize risk by [[asset allocation|allocating funds]] to a wider range of categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and [[inflation]] [[hedge (finance)|hedges]] (including real assets, commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial [[leverage (finance)|leveraging]].&lt;ref name="Peters2"&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last=Peters|title=Does Your Portfolio Have "Bad Breath?": Choosing Essential Betas|journal=First Quadrant Perspective|date=December 2008|volume=5|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.callan.com/research/download/?file=papers/free/368.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 18, 2011|last1=Allen|first1=Gregory C.|title=The Risk Parity Approach to Asset Allocation|publisher=Callan Investments Institute Research|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bob Prince, CIO at [[Bridgewater Associates]], the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity portfolio are uncorrelated assets, low equity risk, and [[passive management]].&lt;ref name="Define RP"&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=ai-CIO|title=Defining Risk Parity|author=Justin Mundt|date=October 2010|page=9|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars contend that a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight to reduce the potential for negative consequences as a result of leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feg.com/research/focus_topic.php?nID=135&amp;issue=2010_11|publisher=Fund Evaluation Group|title=Risk Parity; The Truly Balance Portfolio?|author=Gregory D. Houser|date=November 2010|accessdate=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.&lt;ref name="Levell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepc.com/writable/research_articles/file/2010_03_risk_parity.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 18, 2011|last=Levell|first=Christopher A.|title=Risk Parity: In the Spotlight After 50 Years|publisher=NEPC|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles of risk parity may be applied differently by different financial managers, as they have different methods for categorizing assets into classes, different definitions of risk, different ways of allocating risk within asset classes, different methods for forecasting future risk and different ways of implementing exposure to risk.&lt;ref name="Goldwhite"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.firstquadrant.com/downloads/0810_Diversification_and_Risk_Management_What_Volatility_Tells_Us.pdf|format=pdf|last=Goldwhite|first=Paul|title=Diversification and Risk Management: What Volatility Tells Us|journal=First Quadrant Perspective|date=October 2008|volume=5|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many risk parity funds evolve away from their original intentions, including passive management. The extent to which a risk parity portfolio is managed, is often the distinguishing characteristic between the various kinds of risk parity funds available today.&lt;ref name="Define RP"/&gt;

==Equally-weighted risk contributions portfolios==

The best known version of risk parity is the equally-weighted risk contributions portfolio method.

Equally-weighted risk contributions is not about "having the same volatility", it is about having each asset contributing in the same way to the portfolio overall volatility.  For this we will have to define the contribution of each asset to the portfolio risk.

Consider a portfolio of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; assets where the weight of asset &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;.  The &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; form the allocation vector &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.  Let us further denote the covariance matrix of the assets by &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.  The volatility of the portfolio is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(w) = \sqrt{w' \Sigma w}&lt;/math&gt;
The total risk contribution of asset &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is computed as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i(w) = w_i \times \partial_{w_i} \sigma(w) = \frac{w_i (\Sigma w)_i}{\sqrt{w' \Sigma w}}&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma(w)&lt;/math&gt; is homogeneous of degree 1 in &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; it follows that:
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(w) = \sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i(w)&lt;/math&gt;
so that &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i(w)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the contribution of asset &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the portfolio to the overall risk of the portfolio.

Equal risk contribution then means &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i(w) = \sigma_j(w)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i, j&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently
: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_i(w) = \sigma(w) / N&lt;/math&gt;

The solution can be found by either solving the fixed point problem
: &lt;math&gt;w_i = \frac{\sigma(w)^2}{(\Sigma w)_iN}&lt;/math&gt;
or by solving the minimization problem
: &lt;math&gt;\underset{w}{\arg \min} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[w_i - \frac{\sigma(w)^2}{(\Sigma w)_iN}\right]^2&lt;/math&gt;
both with some constraint that eliminates the invariance of the problem with the scaling of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.

Usually either the overall portfolio volatility is set to &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(w) = \sigma&lt;/math&gt;
or the gross investment of the portfolio is set to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_i w_i = G&lt;/math&gt;
The above minimization problem can be efficiently solved by the [[coordinate descent|cyclical coordinate descent]] method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Théophile |last1=Griveau-Billion|first2=Jean-Charles |last2=Richard|first3=Thierry |last3=Roncalli |title=A Fast Algorithm for Computing High-dimensional Risk Parity Portfolios |date=September 1, 2013 |ssrn=2325255 |arxiv=1311.4057|bibcode=2013arXiv1311.4057G }}&lt;/ref&gt; an open source implementation of which is available in JavaScript.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/lequant40/portfolio_allocation_js|title=PortfolioAllocation JavaScript library|website=github.com/lequant40|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The seeds for the risk parity approach were sown when economist and [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[Harry Markowitz]] introduced the concept of the [[efficient frontier]] into modern portfolio theory in 1952.  Then in 1958, Nobel laureate James Tobin concluded that the [[efficient frontier]] model could be improved by adding risk-free investments and he advocated leveraging a diversified portfolio to improve its risk/return ratio.&lt;ref name="Levell" /&gt; The theoretical analysis of combining leverage and minimizing risk amongst multiple assets in a portfolio was also examined by [[Jack Treynor]] in 1961, [[William F. Sharpe]] in 1964, [[John Lintner]] in 1965 and [[Jan Mossin]] in 1966.  However, the concept was not put into practice due to the difficulties of implementing leverage in the portfolio of a large institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.callan.com/research/download/?file=papers/free/368.pdf|format=pdf|title=The Risk Parity Approach to Asset Allocation|author=Gregory C. Callan|date=February 2010|publisher=Callan Investments Institute Research|page=2|accessdate=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joe Flaherty, senior vice president at [[MFS Investment Management]], "the idea of risk parity goes back to the 1990s". In 1996, Bridgewater Associates launched a risk parity fund called the ''All Weather'' asset allocation strategy.&lt;ref name="IPE"&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Investments and Pensions Europe|title=The Truly Balance Portfolio|author=Martin Steward|date=October 2010|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Instead the term "risk parity" was first used by Edward Qian, of [[PanAgora Asset Management]], when he authored a white paper in 2005.&lt;ref name="Qian1" /&gt; In 2008 the name Risk Parity (short for Risk Premia Parity) was given to this portfolio investment category by Andrew Zaytsev at the investment consulting firm Alan Biller and Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsp.aibpa.com/pdfs/Minutes-2008-12-10-12.pdf|title=Western States Pension Trust, OPEIU, Minutes – December 10-12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ai-cio.com/2014_risk_parity_survey.aspx|title=2014 Risk Parity Investment Survey – October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, the term was adopted by the asset management industry.&lt;ref name="Long View"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Last Frontier"&gt;The Institutional Investor, The Last Frontier, Francis Denmark, Sept 2010, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; In time, other firms such as [[Aquila Capital]] (2004), [[Northwater]], [[Wellington]], [[Invesco]], [[First Quadrant]], [[Putnam Investments]], [[Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension|ATP]] (2006), [[PanAgora Asset Management]] (2006), [[BlackRock]] (2009 - formerly Barclays Global Investors), 1741 Asset Management (2009), [[Neuberger Berman]] (2009), [[AllianceBernstein]] (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Global Pensions|title=AllianceBernstein plans risk parity strategy|date=Oct 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AQR Capital Management]] (2010),&lt;ref name=FIN&gt;{{cite news|last=Unknown author|title=AQR Launches Risk Parity Mutual Fund|url=http://www.finalternatives.com/node/14058|accessdate=Feb 7, 2013|newspaper=FIN Alternatives|date=Oct 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clifton Group]] (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Money Management Letter|title=The Clifton Group Names New Manager of Risk Parity Strategies|date=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salient Partners]] (2012),&lt;ref name=Opal&gt;{{cite web|last=McCann|first=Bailey|title=Salient Partners launches Salient Risk Parity Inde|url=http://www.opalesque.com/643247/Salient_Partners_launches_Salient_Risk_Parity_Index324.html|work=Aug 21, 2012|publisher=Opalesque|accessdate=Feb 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theriskparityindex.com/|publisher=Salient Partners LP|title=Salient Risk Parity Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/salient-partners-debuts-industry-first-risk-parity-index-2012-02-16 |publisher=MarketWatch |title=Salient Partners Debuts Industry-First Risk Parity Index |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302010935/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/salient-partners-debuts-industry-first-risk-parity-index-2012-02-16 |archivedate=March 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schroders]] (2012), [[Natixis Asset Management]] (2013)&lt;ref&gt;[http://citywire.co.uk/wealth-manager/news/natixis-asset-management-launches-risk-parity-fund/a710265?section=globalNatixis Asset Management launches risk parity fund], citywire.co.uk, October 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allianz Global Investors]] (2015)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allianzglobalinvestors.de/web/main?action_id=FondsDetails&amp;isin=LU1111123045], Allianz Global Investors, January 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; began establishing risk parity funds.&lt;ref name="Long View"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipe.com/articles/print.php?id=40028|publisher=Investments and Pensions Europe|date=April 2011|title=Case Study:ATP|author=Henrik Gade Jepsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RefName"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.1741am.com/sites/default/files/revolution_of_financial_theory_en_1741.pdf|format=pdf|last1=Dori|first1=F.|last2=Häusler|first2=F.|last3=Stefanovits|first3=D.|year=2011|title=(R)Evolution of Asset Allocation|journal=White Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
A [[white paper]] report from Callan Investments Institute Research in Feb 2010 reported that a "levered Risk Parity portfolio would have significantly underperformed" versus a standard institutional portfolio in the 1990s but "would have significantly outperformed" a standard institutional portfolio during the decade of 2000 to 2010.&lt;ref name=Callan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Gregory C.|title=President and Director of Research|journal=Callan Investment Institute Research|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;    According to a 2010 article in the Wall Street Journal "Risk-parity funds held up relatively well during the financial crisis" of 2008.  For example, AQR's risk parity fund declined 18% to 19% in 2008 compared with the 22%  decline in the [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]] Balanced Index fund.&lt;ref name="WSJ Feb 7, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Laise|first=Eleanor|title=How Risky Are Those Low-Risk Funds?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703431604575522313792966890?mod=googlewsj|accessdate=Feb 7, 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=Oct 2, 2010|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 Wall Street Journal report the risk parity type of fund offered by hedge funds has "soared in popularity" and  "consistently outperformed traditional strategies since the financial crisis".&lt;ref name="WSJ2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323689204578572050047323638 | title=Fashionable 'Risk Parity' Funds Hit Hard | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=June 27, 2013 | accessdate=July 31, 2013 | author=Corkery, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, mutual funds using the risk parity strategy were reported to have incurred losses of 6.75% during the first half of the year.&lt;ref name="WSJ2"/&gt; Proponents of risk parity argue that the value of balancing risks between asset classes will be realized over long periods including periods of recessions, growth and higher inflation regimes. Historical analysis does provide some evidence of better performance than equities in recessionary environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.blackrock.com/investing/literature/whitepaper/putting-risk-parity-to-work-4-3-14-final.pdf|url = http://www.blackrock.com/investing/literature/whitepaper/putting-risk-parity-to-work-4-3-14-final.pdf|website = www.blackrock.com|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticisms from skeptics, the risk parity approach has seen a "flurry of activity" following a decade of "subpar equity performance".&lt;ref name="McCrum"&gt;{{cite web|author=McCrum, Dan |date=September 20, 2012 |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/296cc650-02fe-11e2-a484-00144feabdc0.html# |title=Investors rush for ‘risk parity’ shield |accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period 2005 to 2012 several companies began offering risk parity products including: [[Barclays Global Investors]] (now [[BlackRock]]), [[Schroders]], [[First Quadrant]], Mellon Capital Management, [[Neuberger Berman]] and [[State Street Global Advisors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Appell|first=Douglas |date=November 30, 2009 |title=Bridgewater under the Weather; 'Depression mode' decision good news for competitors|publisher=Pensions &amp; Investments|page=1|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

== Use of leverage ==
According to a 2011 article in ''Investments &amp; Pensions Europe'', the risk parity approach has "moderate risks" which include:  communicating its value to boards of directors;  unforeseen events like the 2008 market decline; market timing risks associated with implementation; the use of leverage and derivatives and basis risks associated with derivatives.&lt;ref name="Missed Op"&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=I&amp;PE|title=Missed Opportunity?|author=Mathew Roberts|date=April 2011|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

However, proponents of risk parity say that its purpose is to avoid predicting future returns.&lt;ref name="Asness"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asness|first=Clifford S.|title=Why not 100% Equities|journal=Journal of Portfolio Management|date=Winter 1996|doi=10.3905/jpm.1996.29|volume=22|issue=2|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ai-ciodigital.com/ai-cio/20100506/|page=27|title=Risk Parity, Or Simply Risky?&amp;#124;ai5000|date=May–June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inker"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/27916202/GMO-The-Hidden-Risks-of-Risk-Parity-Portfolios|last=Inker|first=Ben|title=The Hidden Risk of Risk Parity Portfolios|publisher=GMO White Paper|date=March 2010|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inker also says that risk parity requires too much leverage to produce the same expected returns as conventional alternatives. Proponents answer that the reduced risk from additional diversification more than offsets the additional leverage risk and that leverage through publicly traded futures and [[prime brokerage]] financing of assets also means a high percentage of cash in the portfolio to cover losses and margin calls.&lt;ref name="Qian2" /&gt; Additionally Inker says that bonds have negative [[skewness|skew]], (small probability of large losses and large probability of small gains) which makes them a dangerous investment to leverage. Proponents have countered by saying that their approach calls for reduced exposure to bonds as volatility increases and provides less skew than conventional portfolios.&lt;ref name="Foresti"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Foresti|first1=Steven J.|first2=Michael E.|last2=Rush|title=Risk Focused Diversification: Utilizing Leverage within Asset Allocation|publisher=Wilshire Consulting|date=February 11, 2010|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the use of leverage argue that using leverage can be risk-reducing rather than risk-increasing provided four conditions are met: (i) enough unencumbered cash is kept to meet any margin calls (ii) leverage is applied to a well-diversified portfolio (iii) assets can be rebalanced frequently and (iv) counterparty risk is minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = T&amp;C US - Compliance - BlackRock|url = https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-us/literature/whitepaper/leverage-in-risk-parity.pdf|website = BlackRock|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk parity and the bull market in bonds ==
A 2012 article in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' indicated possible challenges for risk parity funds "at the peak of a 30-year bull market for fixed income".  While advocates point out their diversification amongst bonds as well as "inflation-linked securities, corporate credit, emerging market debt, commodities and equities, balanced by how each asset class responds to two factors: changes in the expected rate of economic growth and changes to expectations for inflation".&lt;ref name="McCrum" /&gt;  A 2013 article in the ''[[Financial News]]'' reported that "risk parity continues to prosper, as investors come to appreciate the better balance of different risks that it represents in an uncertain world."&lt;ref name="Financian News 2013"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2013-03-08/views-from-the-top-pensions-2013 | title=Views from the top: What’s hot and what’s not | date=March 8, 2013 | accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sharp fall in bond prices of 2013 ("taper tantrum"), investors continued to question the impact of rising rates on risk parity portfolios or other more concentrated equity portfolios. A historical analysis of episodes of rising rates show the value in distinguishing between orderly and disorderly rising rates regimes. Risk parity has weaker performance in disorderly rising rates environments but its performance over time is not dependent on falling bond yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.blackrock.com/investing/literature/whitepaper/market-advantage-will-rising-rates-sink-risk-parity.pdf|url = http://www.blackrock.com/investing/literature/whitepaper/market-advantage-will-rising-rates-sink-risk-parity.pdf|website = www.blackrock.com|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk parity and the Capital Asset Pricing Model ==
Risk parity advocates assert that the unlevered risk parity portfolio is quite close to the [[Capital asset pricing model#Efficient frontier|tangency portfolio]], as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data.&lt;ref name="Tütüncü"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tütüncü|first1=R.H|last2=Koenig|first2=M.|year=2004|title=Robust asset allocation|journal=Annals of Operations Research|volume=132|pages=132–157|doi=10.1023/B:ANOR.0000045281.41041.ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical and empirical arguments are made in support of this contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the [[efficient frontier]] is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical [[Sharpe ratio]]s.&lt;ref name="Qian1" /&gt; Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.&lt;ref name="Anderson Bianchi Goldberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ai" /&gt;

'''Robert Banks''' (late 18th century-first half 19th century) was an English maker of optical instruments.

His workshop was located in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], in central [[London]], 1796-1827. The [[Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale]] of [[Florence]] commissioned several optical instruments from him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6586">'''Robert John Lechmere Guppy''' (15 August 1836 in [[London]] – 5 August 1916 in [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born [[natural history|naturalist]] after whom the [[guppy]] is named.  He contributed much to the [[geology]], [[palaeontology]] and [[zoology]] of the West Indian region, in particular Trinidad.

He was one of four children of Robert Guppy, a lawyer and the Mayor of San Fernando, and [[Amelia Elizabeth Guppy]], a painter and one of the pioneers of photography, who navigated the [[Orinoco River]] accompanied by only a few native Indians. "Lechmere", as he was called, was raised by his grandparents, Richard Parkinson and Lucy Lechmere, in [[Kinnersley Castle]], a 13th-century Norman castle in [[Herefordshire]]. Richard Parkinson wanted Lechmere to take over the castle, a role in which he had no interest. Having come into an inheritance from another relative, he left England at the age of 18. He visited [[Australia]], [[Tasmania]] and was [[shipwreck]]ed on the coast of [[New Zealand]] in 1856. After living with the [[Māori people|Māori]] for two years and mapping the area, Lechmere left New Zealand for Trinidad, where his parents were living. He married Alice Rostant, the daughter of local French Creole planters and a descendant of the Counts of Rostant, French aristocrats who had fled to Trinidad to escape the French Revolution and became Trinidad's first Superintendent of Schools. 

He was a [[civil engineer]] by trade and helped in the construction of the Cipero Railway. He later became Chief Inspector of Schools until his retirement in 1891.

Although he had no formal training in the sciences &lt;ref name="tofino"&gt;[http://www.tofino-bc.com/guppy/lechmere.htm Famous / infamous / interesting Guppys of the past&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Lechmere wrote and published numerous articles on the [[Paleontology|palaeontology]] of the region. He served as President of the Scientific Association of Trinidad, as well as of the Royal Victoria Institute Board. He contributed about seventy memoirs or papers between 1863 and 1913. His special interest went to paleoconchology and Recent mollusks, especially the terrestrial and fluviatile species.

Though sometimes rumored to have been a clergyman, Lechmere Guppy was, in fact, an agnostic.&lt;ref name="tofino"/&gt;

Guppy discovered the [[Guppy|Guppy fish]] in [[Trinidad]] in 1866, and the fish was named ''Girardinus guppii'' in his honour by [[Albert C. L. G. Günther]] later that year. However, the fish had previously been described in America. Although ''Girardinus guppii'' is now considered a [[junior synonym]] of ''Poecilia reticulata'', the common name "guppy" still remains.

Most ScienceAtHome games are [[casual games]] and require no formal scientific training. Over 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forsker vil tage eksistensberettigelsen fra Videnskab.dk|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/forsker-vil-tage-eksistensberettigelsen-fra-videnskabdk|}}&lt;/ref&gt; people have contributed to ScienceAtHome citizen science projects by playing games. Research games are also part of a much larger movement of creating [[serious games]] that go beyond mere entertainment.

The premise behind such games is that humans are better than computers at performing certain tasks, because of their intuition and superior visual processing. Video games are now being used to channel these abilities to solve problems in quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physics: Quantum problems solved through games|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v532/n7598/full/532184a.html|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Result from the flagship game, [[Quantum Moves]] have been published in scientific magazine, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.

 “A computer goes through all available pathways the atom can move, whereas people search for solutions that intuitively feel right”– said game development leader Dr Jacob Sherson, associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Aarhus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamers help solve quantum questions|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/games/citizen-science-gamers-help-solve-quantum-questions-20160502-gokkoz.html|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of computer players solving quantum problems came to Jacob Sherson’s mind while he was doing research at [[Johannes Gutenberg University]], Mainz, in the group of Prof. [[Immanuel Bloch]]. The first form of ScienceAtHome was announced in 2012 based on the idea that computer game players could solve quantum problems. It was then called CODER - “Pilot Center for Community-driven Research: Game Assisted Quantum Computing” - and it started with a game called Quantum Computer Game. CODER later grew and evolved into ScienceAtHome, and the Quantum Computer Games was renamed as Quantum Moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computerspillere skal løse kvantegåde|url=http://www.au.dk/nyheder/nyhed/artikel/computerspillere-skal-loese-kvantegaade/|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
ScienceAtHome appeared in both national and international press several times. It has been featured in The Wall Street Journal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Videogamers Are Recruited to Fight Tuberculosis and Other Ills|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/videogamers-are-recruited-to-fight-tuberculosis-and-other-ills-1462290212|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington Post, LA Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Take that, A.I.: Video-gamers solve quantum physics mystery using human intuition|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-quantum-computer-video-game-water-20160413-story.html|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Yorker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better research through video games|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/better-research-through-video-games|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sydney Morning Herald and the BBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantum Games|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0770qv7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacob Sherson gave a speech at TEDxAarhus 2016 called “How to become a quantum physicist in five minutes”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEDxAarhus 2016 Speakers - Jacob Sherson|url=https://tedxaarhus.com/team-details/jacob-sherson/|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinja Haikka, Postdoctoral Researcher in Theoretical Physics, also introduced ScienceAtHome at Women in Science event at Aarhus University, which was published at local television ITV OJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pinja Haikka, Women in Science Day speech|url=https://vimeo.com/206396107|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Société Chimique de France''' ('''SCF''') is a [[learned society]] and [[professional association]] founded in 1857 to represent the interests of French chemists in a variety of ways in local, national and international contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Société Chimique de France (SCF), [http://www.societechimiquedefrance.fr/fr/missions-de-la-scf.html   Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409094637/http://www.societechimiquedefrance.fr/fr/missions-de-la-scf.html |date=2010-04-09 }}; retrieved 2011-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 2009 the organization was known as the '''Société Française de Chimie'''.

==History==
The Society traces its origins back to an organization of young Parisian chemists who began meeting in May 1857 under the name Société Chimique, with the goal of self-study and mutual education.  In 1858 the established chemist [[Adolphe Wurtz]] joined the society, and immediately transformed it into a [[learned society]] modeled after the [[Chemical Society]] of London, which was the precursor of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. Like its British counterpart, the French association sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout France and across international borders.&lt;ref name="Lagowski1991"&gt;Lagowski, J. J. (1991). [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed068p1  "A British Sesquicentennial,"] ''Journal of Chemical Education,'' Vol 68, No. 1, p. 1; acknowledging the sesquicentennial of The Chemical Society in London, which eventually became the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]; retrieved 2011-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Support for the ''[[Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France|Bulletin de la Société Chimique de Paris]]'' began in 1858.   

In the 21st century, the society has become a member of [[ChemPubSoc Europ]]e, which is an organization of 16 European chemical societies.  This European consortium was established in the late 1990s as many chemical journals owned by national chemical societies were amalgamated.&lt;ref&gt;ChemPubSoc Europe, [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu.html mission]; [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu_members.html  participating societies]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 they started [[ChemistryViews]].org, their news and information service for chemists and other scientists worldwide.

===Prizes and awards===
The society acknowledges individual achievement with prizes and awards, including:
* Louis Ancel Prize
* Raymond Berr Prize

'''''(Documents Relating to) The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire''''' is a 1983 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the fifth book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comprises a set of documents that describe the final days of the Volyen Empire, located at the edge of our galaxy and under the influence of three other galactic empires, the benevolent [[Canopus]], the tyrannical [[Sirius]], and the malicious Shammat of Puttiora. It was first published in the United States in March 1983 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in May 1983 by [[Jonathan Cape]].

''The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire'' is a social satire written in the tradition of [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[George Orwell]],&lt;ref name=Kakutani&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE4DF1539F937A25750C0A965948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Michiko |last=Kakutani |authorlink=Michiko Kakutani |accessdate=16 December 2008 | date=14 March 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focuses on the debasement of language in [[rhetoric|political rhetoric]].&lt;ref name=Rothstein&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04EED61039F930A35757C0A965948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Against Galactic Rhetoric |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Edward  |last=Rothstein |authorlink=Edward Rothstein |accessdate=16 December 2008 | date=3 April 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lessing's [[fictional universe]] it is propaganda that keeps the fragile empires afloat, and when language becomes too distorted, some of her characters succumb to a condition called "undulant rhetoric" and are placed in a Hospital for Rhetorical Diseases.&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt;{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=pp. 11 &amp; 15}}

Because of its focus on characterisation and social/cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of technological details, this book is not strictly science fiction but [[soft science fiction]], or "space fiction" as Lessing calls her ''Canopus in Argos'' series.{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}} While ''The Sentimental Agents'' can be read as a stand-alone book, Lessing does continue with the history of the Sirian Empire, picking up from where she left off in ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' (1980), the third book in the ''Canopus'' series.{{sfn|Lessing|1994b}}{{sfn|Lessing|1994c}}

==Reception==
[[Edward Rothstein]] in a review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes ''The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire'' as "a satirical romp through rhetoric in a foreign empire", but complains that the tone of the book "wavers uncertainly, mixing farce, cynicism and banal religiosity."&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt;

In another New York Times review, [[Michiko Kakutani]] writes that in this book Lessing has "narrowed her cosmic focus to a specific issue, namely the manipulative use of language and words" which, she believes, was handled with "more acerbity and more humour" by [[George Orwell]] in ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949).&lt;ref name=Kakutani/&gt;

==Plot==
The Volyen Empire is a relatively weak interstellar empire situated at the edge of our galaxy.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p. 13}} It comprises the planet Volyen, its two moons, Volyenadna and Volyendesta (also referred to as planets), and two neighbouring planets, Maken and Slovin.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p. 12}} Intelligent life evolved independently on each of these five "planets", and over time unstable empires formed, where each planet for a period ruled the others. The Volyen Empire is the last of these empires and rules the region with force and repression.

Although this system is at the edge of the Canopean Empire's sphere of influence, Canopus sends agents to the region because Volyen's colonisation of Maken and Slovin provoked the Sirian Empire who had earmarked these planets for "possible expansion". In addition, Shammat, Canopus's enemy, had established a presence in the region.

Disillusioned and oppressed, the citizens of Volyen and its colonies start speaking out against the Volyen government. Revolutionary groups form and counter the Empire's rhetoric with rhetoric of their own. Krolgul of Shammat, buoyed by the turmoil, encourages anti-government behaviour. Klorathy, a senior Canopean Colonial administrator, is sent to Volyen to observe the unfolding events, and to monitor Incent, one of his agents who has been caught up in the sentiment of the revolutionary rhetoric. Incent has also fallen prey to Krolgul's propaganda and is withdrawn from the field by Klorathy and placed in a Hospital for Rhetorical Diseases on Volyendesta.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p. 15}}

Sirius is now threatening to invade the region, and this is welcomed by the downtrodden in the Volyen Empire because they are sure that Sirius will set them free. Many citizens became Sirian agents and provide Sirius with information and support. But the Sirian Empire is itself in turmoil. A conflict on Sirius split the governing oligarchy into the Questioners, led by the Five who want Sirius's expansion program halted, and the Conservers, who believe Sirius should continue colonising other planets.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p.14}} The Five were defeated and Sirius resumed its expansion, but this time with an uncontrolled brutality that turned the Sirian Empire into a tyranny. When the Sirian agents learn about Sirius's tyranny, their loyalties are divided between Sirius and Volyen, and they become known as "sentimental agents".{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p.190}}

Sirius invades the Volyen Empire with troops from nearby Sirian occupied planets. The troops, themselves colonial subjects of the now declining Sirian Empire, were told that Volyen is poor and deprived and needs Sirius's help. But when they land they discover that the Volyens are better off than they are, and return home and declare their own planets independent from Sirius. Volyenadna and Volyendesta, with Klorathy's help, become self-sustaining and declare ''their'' independence from the crumbling Volyen Empire.

The change of circumstances in the region weakens Krolgul and his influence, and he returns to Shammat. Incent, now "recovered" from his illness, decides that he is going to help Krolgul. Klorathy, still Incent's custodian, follows him to Shammat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33147">{{more footnotes|date=February 2016}}This '''timeline of Macintosh models''' lists all major types of [[Macintosh]] computers produced by [[Apple Inc.]] in order of introduction date. [[Macintosh Performa]] models were often physically identical to other models, in which case they are omitted in favor of the identical twin. Also not listed are model numbers that identify software bundles. For example, the Performa 6115CD and 6116CD differed only in software and were identical to the [[Power Macintosh 6100]], so only the 6100 is listed below. The [[Apple Network Server]] and [[Apple Lisa]] are included, as they filled high-end niches of the Macintosh line despite not directly running Mac OS.

The '''Titan II GLV''' (Gemini Launch Vehicle) or '''Gemini-Titan II''' was an American [[expendable launch system]] derived from the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II missile]], which was used to launch twelve [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] missions for [[NASA]] between 1964 and 1966. Two unmanned launches followed by ten manned ones were conducted from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 19|Launch Complex 19]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], starting with [[Gemini 1]] on April 8, 1964.

The Titan II was a two-stage [[liquid-fuel rocket]], using a [[hypergolic propellant]] combination of [[Aerozine 50]] fuel and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] oxidizer. The first stage was powered by an [[LR87]] engine (with two combustion chambers and nozzles, fed by a single set of turbomachinery), and the second stage was propelled by an [[LR-91]] engine.

==Modifications from the Titan II missile==
In addition to greater payload capability, the Titan II promised greater reliability than the [[Atlas LV-3B]] which had been selected for [[Project Mercury]], because Titan's [[hypergolic propellant|hypergolic]]-fueled engines contained far fewer components.

Several modifications were made to the Titan missile to [[human-rating certification|man-rate]] it for Project Gemini:&lt;ref&gt;Simplicity, Duplication Will Give Titan 2 Manned Flight Capability, Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, September 3, 1962 pages 38-45&lt;/ref&gt;

* A "Gemini Malfunction Detection System" was installed to inform the crew of the rocket's status, and improve response in an emergency.
* Redundant systems were installed to reduce the chances of launch failures.
* The inertial guidance system was replaced by a lighter-weight ground-radio guidance system
* The avionics truss in the second stage was modified slightly
* To help guard against the possibility of a guidance malfunction causing the engine nozzles to gimbal hard right or left, an extra backup guidance system was added.
* The second stage propellant tanks were lengthened for longer burn time and unnecessary [[vernier thruster|vernier engines]] and [[retrorocket]]s were removed. Because the second stage engine had had issues with combustion instability, it was equipped with baffled injectors.
* The first stage was loaded with 13,000 pounds (5896 kilograms) more propellant than the Titan ICBM although the storage tank size remained unchanged.
* Modifications were made to the tracking, electrical and hydraulics systems in the interest of improved reliability.
* The propellants were chilled to slightly improve vehicle performance. This allowed for more mass to be accommodated.
* First stage engine thrust was reduced slightly to cut down on vibration and G loads.
* First stage engine burn would go until propellant depletion unlike Titan ICBMs which were designed to cut off when propellant flow/pressure and engine thrust started dropping as the tanks emptied. This was to prevent the possibility of a malfunctioning pressure sensor triggering an abort condition. Also, running until depletion would slightly boost the Titan's capacity for payload.

Modifications were overseen by the [[Air Force Systems Command]]. The [[Aerojet]] company, the manufacturer of the Titan's engines, had released a revised model during mid-1963 due to deficiencies in the original design, and also to attempt to improve manufacturing procedures.

Film footage of [[Gemini 10]]'s launch revealed that the first stage oxidizer tank ruptured shortly after staging and released a cloud of [[dinitrogen tetroxide|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]. As first stage telemetry had been terminated at staging, there was no data other than photographic/visual evidence to go by, however the conclusion was that either loose debris struck the oxidizer tank dome or else exhaust from the second stage engine had burned through it.

[[Gemini 12]]'s launch vehicle also experienced a tank rupture after staging and film review of Titan II ICBM launches found several occurrences of this phenomenon. Since this did not appear to pose any safety risks to the astronauts, NASA decided that it was not a concern.

During Titan II ICBM development, it had been found that the first stage turbopump gearbox was prone to total failure caused by resonant vibration in the idler gear. This problem had not occurred on actual launches, but only static firing tests. This was considered to be a critical item to fix. Aerojet developed a totally redesigned gearbox, and all of Gemini launch vehicles except for the unmanned [[Gemini 1]] used it.

There was also a potentially serious problem with the turbopump bearings which led to more design changes, however the odds of failing on a Gemini launch were slim to nil since GLV boosters used specially selected and tested bearings, in addition the turbopumps would be "hot fired" as part of prelaunch checks.

Combustion instability in the second stage engine was also a concern although that too had only been witnessed in static firing runs. A new injector with improved baffling was developed for the engine and flight-tested on a [[Titan IIIC]] launch; all GLVs from [[Gemini 8]] onwards incorporated it.

After a Titan II propellant feed line was found to have some damage  during factory inspections, NASA put out the requirement that all GLV propellant lines had to be [[X-ray]]ed in order to prevent a potentially disastrous fuel leak during launch. X-ray tests later found several more damaged propellant lines, most likely due to careless handling.

The most significant issue in man-rating the Titan II was resolving problems with resonant vibration known as "pogo" (since the action was said to resemble that of a [[pogo stick]]) that could produce g-forces sufficient to incapacitate astronauts,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} but the Air Force were not interested in helping NASA with a problem that did not affect the ICBM program and could potentially delay it, or require major modifications to the design. However, Martin-Marietta argued that the pogo problem could be fixed fairly easily, and also the Air Force began to develop more of an interest in man-rating the Titan II due to the proposed [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program. The primary changes made to resolve pogo were adding oxidizer [[standpipe (plumbing)|standpipe]]s, increasing the pressure in the propellant tanks, and adding a mechanical accumulator to the fuel suction side.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker and Grimwood, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Another nuisance problem that occurred during the Gemini program was code-named "Green Man" and involved momentary pitch oscillations of the Titan second stage following engine cutoff. This phenomenon had happened on both Gemini and unmanned Titan II/III flights and had resulted in the failure of the ablative skirt on the second stage at least twice (those instances were dubbed "Brown Man"). Investigation following skirt failure on a Titan IIIC launch concluded that pressure buildup in the ablative skirt caused the pitch oscillations, but NASA decided that there was probably little chance of loose debris from the skirt contacting the Gemini spacecraft, so no corrective action had to be taken and in any case, the Titan IIIC incident was found to be the result of poor quality control which would not affect the more tightly supervised Gemini program.

The assembly of these rockets was done at Martin-Marietta's plant in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], so not to interfere with missile work at the one in [[Denver, Colorado]], although this also saved the former plant from a planned shutdown. As with the Mercury-Atlas launch vehicles, a high degree of workmanship was stressed as well as more thorough testing of components and improved handling procedures compared with Titans designed for unmanned flights. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19780012208_1978012208.pdf |title=New Image - ONLY - Scan to PDF |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Titan II had a much higher thrust-to-weight ratio than the [[Saturn V]]. Astronauts experienced almost 6G before the second stage stopped firing at {{convert|100|mi}} altitude. [[Richard F. Gordon Jr.]] compared the Titan II to "a young fighter pilot's ride. It's faster than the Saturn's old man's ride." [[Frank Borman]] said that simulations did not prepare him for the "almost deafening" noise, which he compared to a jet's afterburner or large train. [[Walter Schirra]] and [[Gordon Cooper]] reported that the ride was smoother than on the Atlas, however.&lt;ref name="agle199809a"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D.

'''William John "Pete" Knight''' (November 18, 1929&amp;nbsp;– May 7, 2004), ([[Colonel (United States)|Col]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]]), was an American [[aeronautical engineer]], [[politician]], [[Vietnam War]] combat [[aviator|pilot]], [[test pilot]], and [[astronaut]] in the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]] and [[North American X-15]] programs. Knight holds the world's speed record for flight in a winged, powered aircraft.

As a politician, he is noted as the author of [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|California Proposition 22]], which forbade the state from performing or recognizing [[same-sex marriage]].

==Early life and education==
Knight was born November 18, 1929 in [[Noblesville, Indiana]], to parents William T. Knight (1906–1968) and Mary Emma Knight (1909–1959).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8749323 Knight's parents]&lt;/ref&gt; Following high school, Knight attended [[Butler University]] and [[Purdue University]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] from the U.S. [[Air Force Institute of Technology]] in 1958.

==Personal==
Knight was married to Helena Stone and they had three sons, [[Steve Knight (politician)|Steve]], Peter, and David. Helena preceded Knight in death. Knight remarried and at his death in 2004 he was survived by his widow Gail, a brother, three sons, four stepchildren and 15 grandchildren.

==Air Force career==
Knight joined the [[United States Air Force]] in 1951. While only a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]], he flew an [[F-89 Scorpion|F-89]] at the National Air Show in 1954 and won the [[Allison Jet Trophy]].

Starting in 1958, following his graduation from both U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology and the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School]], Knight served as a test pilot at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]]. He was a project test pilot for the [[F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]], [[F-101 Voodoo]], [[F-104 Starfighter]] and later, [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] and [[F-5 Freedom Fighter|F-5]] test programs. In 1960, he was one of six test pilots selected to fly the [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]], which was slated to become the first winged orbital space vehicle capable of lifting reentries and conventional landings. After the X-20 program was canceled in 1963, he completed the astronaut training curriculum through the [[Aerospace Research Pilot School]] at Edwards AFB and was selected to fly the [[North American X-15]].

He had more than his share of eventful flights in the X-15. While climbing through {{Convert|107000|ft}} at [[Mach number|Mach]] 4.17 on June 29, 1967, he suffered a total electrical failure and all onboard systems shut down. After reaching a maximum altitude of {{Convert|173000|ft}}, he calmly set up a visual approach and, resorting to old-fashioned "seat-of-the-pants" flying, he glided down to a safe emergency landing at Mud Lake, [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;Mud Lake, Nye County, Nevada, {{Coord|37|52|10|N|117|04|17|W}}.  Located at the northern edge of the [[Tonopah Test Range]], this is the southernmost Mud Lake of several dry lakes bearing the same name in Nevada.&lt;/ref&gt;  For his remarkable feat of airmanship that day, he earned a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].

[[Image:Pete Knight by X15 19671003.jpg|left|thumb|Maj. William "Pete" Knight with the X-15]]
On October 3, 1967, Knight set a world aircraft speed record for manned aircraft by piloting the X-15A-2 to {{Convert|4520|mph|km/h|0|sp=us}} ([[Mach number|Mach]] 6.72), a record that still stands today. During 16 flights in the aircraft, Knight also became one of only five pilots to earn their [[Astronaut Badge|Astronaut Wings]] by flying an airplane in space, reaching an altitude of {{Convert|280500|ft}}.

After nearly ten years of test flying at Edwards AFB, he went to [[Southeast Asia]] in 1968 where he completed a total of 253 [[Aerial warfare|combat missions]] in the [[F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Following his combat tour, he served as test director during development of the [[F-15 Eagle]] at [[Wright Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He also was the Program Director for the International Fighter (F-5) Program at Wright-Patterson. In 1979, he returned to Edwards AFB, and served as a test pilot for the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]].

After 32 years of service and more than 6,000 hours in the cockpits of more than 100 different aircraft, he retired from the U.S. Air Force as a [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] in 1982.

==Political career==
In 1984, he was elected to the city council of [[Palmdale, California]], and four years later became the city's first elected mayor.  In 1992, he was elected to serve in the [[California State Assembly]] representing the 36th District. He served in the [[California State Senate|State Senate]] representing the 17th District from 1996 until his death on May 7, 2004. Knight's youngest son, [[Steve Knight (politician)|Steve Knight]] served as Assemblyman for the 36th Assembly District from 2008 to 2012, the seat previously held by his father.

===Proposition 22===
{{Main| California Proposition 22 (2000)}}
During his term in the Senate, Knight gained statewide attention in 2000 as the author of [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]], a.k.a. the "Knight Initiative," the purpose of which was to ban same-sex marriage: "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California." The proposition passed with 61.4% approval and 38.6% against. On March 9, 2004, Knight's son, David Knight, who is gay, married his partner during the period when [[Same-sex marriage in California#2004 San Francisco marriages|San Francisco performed same-sex marriages in defiance of state law]]. These marriages were later nullified by the [[California Supreme Court]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Son-of-gay-marriage-foe-weds-in-San-Francisco-2811435.php|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|title=Son of gay marriage foe weds in San Francisco / Sen. Knight wrote state law banning same-sex unions}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court later found Proposition 22 to be unconstitutional in ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-08-05/news/22206069_1_ban-on-same-sex-marriage-gay-rights-proponents-gays-and-lesbians | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first1=Joe | last1=Garofoli | first2=John | last2=Wildermuth | first3=Demian | last3=Bulwa | title=Mormons urged to back ban on same-sex marriage | date=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his gay son, Knight also had a younger brother who died of AIDS-related complications in 1995 at age 60. Of his younger brother, Knight would only say, "We never talked about it." &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-11/local/me-42738_1_gay-marriage-issue&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xplanet''' is a renderer for [[planet]]ary and [[solar system]] images, capable of producing various types of graphics depicting the solar system.  It is normally used to create [[computer wallpaper]]s, which may be updated with the latest [[cloud]] maps or the regions of [[Earth]] which are in [[sunlight]]. Xplanet is [[free software]] released under the [[GNU GPL]].

== Flat maps ==

Xplanet can be used to produce [[cartography|projected maps]] of any planet (but typically Earth), for example [[mollweide projection]]s which show the whole earth at once, or [[mercator projection]]s with a rectangular appearance suitable for filling the screen.

It is possible to overlay clouds or text (such as the location of recent events) onto these maps; a popular option is shading areas currently experiencing night.

== Planetary images==

Xplanet can also be used to render more general views of objects in the solar system, such as a view of the Earth from the moon.  In more recent versions, Xplanet depicts [[eclipses]], and some of its images show [[Jupiter]]'s moons casting an eclipse onto the planet.

== Technical ==

Xplanet runs on [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and other [[Unix]] operating systems and also on [[Microsoft Windows]], and was derived from an older Unix application called ''[[xearth]]''.

It can either generate wallpaper, save the resulting image, or produce textual output detailing the locations of various objects.

Configuration is done by modifying a text file.  The Windows version comes with a simple editor called [http://www.mkoe.de winXPlanetBG] to assist in updating the configurations and helps to download the cloud maps automatically.  [http://www.OSXplanet.com/ OSXplanet] is an interactive wallpaper derivative for the [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;Rob Griffiths, [http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050413095930977 OSXplanet - Display planetary desktop images], macosxhints.com, Apr 13 2005, Pick of the Week&lt;/ref&gt;

==XplanetFX==
XplanetFX is a GTK-frontend for Xplanet under Linux. It provides a simple to use GUI to configure Xplanet and schedule renderings. It also claims to produce higher quality renderings. XplanetFX is free software released under a permissive [[License_proliferation#Vanity_licenses|vanity license]].
