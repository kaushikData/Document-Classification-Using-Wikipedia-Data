In '''[[Morocco]]''', the 75 '''second-level administrative subdivisions''' are 13 [[prefecture]]s and 62 [[province]]s. They are subdivisions of the [[Regions of Morocco|12 regions of Morocco]].&lt;ref name=popu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcp.ma/file/167575/ |title=Population légale d'après les résultats du RGPH 2014 sur le Bulletin officiel N° 6354 |accessdate=2015-07-11 |format=PDF |work=Haut-Commissariat au Plan |language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each prefecture or province is subdivided into [[arrondissement]]s (only in prefectures of some [[metropolitan areas]]),  [[municipalities]] (''communes'', sing. ''commune'') or urban municipalities (''communes urbaines'', sing. ''commune urbaine'') in other urban areas, and [[district]]s (''cercles'', sing. ''cercle'') in rural areas. The districts are subdivided into rural municipalities (''communes rurales'', sing. ''commune rural''). One prefecture (Casablanca) is also subdivided into ''préfectures d'arrondissements'' (sing. ''préfecture d'arrondissements''), similar to districts (''cercles'') except they are grouping a few arrondissements instead of rural municipalities.

'''Note''': The arrondissements and (urban) municipalities should probably be thought of as fourth-level subdivisions, on the same level as the rural municipalities, but they are not part of any district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcp.ma/pubData/nomenclatures/codegeo.pdf HCP.ma List of districts and municipalities (communes) of Morocco by province/prefecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418220136/http://www.hcp.ma/pubData/nomenclatures/codegeo.pdf |date=2009-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western Sahara (most under ''[[de facto]]'' Moroccan administration) ===
{{See also|International recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|Political status of Western Sahara}}
Most of Western Sahara is administered ''de facto'' by Morocco (where the area is informally named the ''[[Southern Provinces]]'' by the Moroccan government and media); [[Free Zone (region)|the rest]] is administered by the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]].

The [[Legal status of Western Sahara|United Nations]] considers the territory to be disputed, as it was not legally transferred by Spain when it abandoned its former colony in 1975, and several states (notably members of the African Union) either recognize the SADR as the sole legitimate government of Western Sahara, or consider that the status of the region (either as an independent state, or as part of Morocco, or as part of [[Mauritania]] that initially claimed a part of it) has still not been [[autodetermination|autodetermined]] by the local population prior to its annexation. The United Nations has no legal instruments confirming the claims on the region made by the governments of Morocco or the self-proclaimed SADR, and in international treaties it is still a formal part of Spain that remains to be properly decolonized, even though Spain and Mauritania no longer claim any part of it.

Since the annexation, the situation is worsened by the fact that most of the historic Western Saharan population has fled either to the remaining ''free zone'' (now isolated by the Moroccan militarized berm), or to refugee camps in neighbouring countries (notably  [[Algeria]]), due to lack of resources in the ''free zone''. The remaining native Western Saharan population now lives as a minority among the new Moroccan occupants. The absence of a legal government with a permanent administration in the ''free zone'' has also introduced a threat to the security of the surrounding countries in the Saharan and Sahel regions, including Morocco itself.

==== ''[[Guelmim-Oued Noun|Guelmim-Oued Noun Region]]'' ====
* ''[[Assa-Zag Province]]'' (partly located in Western Sahara)
* [[Sidi Ifni Province]] (located in Mainland Morocco)
* [[Guelmim Province]] (located in Mainland Morocco)
* [[Tan-Tan Province]] (located in Mainland Morocco)

==== ''[[Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra|Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra Region]]'' ====
* ''[[Boujdour Province]]''
* ''[[Es Semara Province]]''
* ''[[Laâyoune Province]]''
* ''[[Tarfaya Province]]''

== Wilaya ==
In Morocco, a [[wilaya]] is an administrative division created since 1981 that "brings together many provinces or prefectures or both at the same time, and is intended to endow big urban units such as Casablanca with an administrative organization capable of meeting the needs that emerge from these expanding cities and their growing populations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casablanca.ma/index/portal/media-type/html/language/en/user/anon/page/entrepreneurEn.psml?noteid=2871 The Wilaya of Grand Casablanca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501220739/http://www.casablanca.ma/index/portal/media-type/html/language/en/user/anon/page/entrepreneurEn.psml?noteid=2871 |date=May 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, strictly speaking, the level of wilayas are between the regions and prefectures/provinces (although wilayas only cover urban areas). However, they are often used synonymous with regions or prefectures/provinces in common usage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maroc.ma/PortailInst/Fr/MenuGauche/Infos+pratiques/Adresses+utiles/Wilayas+du+Royaume.htm Wilayas, Prefectures and Provinces]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719054854/http://www.maroc.ma/PortailInst/Fr/MenuGauche/Infos%2Bpratiques/Adresses%2Butiles/Wilayas%2Bdu%2BRoyaume.htm |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Frühlingslandschft Aaretal Schweiz.jpg|thumb|right|Agricultural road in Switzerland]]
An '''agricultural road''' or '''farm track''' is a [[service road]] that serves predominantly [[agriculture|agricultural]] or [[forestry]] purposes and has only local significance. Agricultural roads are typically unpaved [[dirt road]]s or covered with [[gravel]], but in some cases [[asphalt]] roads are agricultural roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In the [[United States]], a "[[farm-to-market road]]" or "ranch-to-market road" (sometimes "farm road" or "ranch road" for short) is a [[state road]] or [[county road]] that connects [[rural]] or [[agricultural]] areas to market towns.&lt;ref name="FM facts"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Texas Department of Transportation |author=Staff |url=http://www.dot.state.tx.us/tpp/hwy/fmfacts.htm|title=Farm/Ranch to Market Facts |accessdate=February 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UR Chron"&gt;{{cite news |last=Babineck |first= Mark |title=Tex-Arcana: What's a farm-to-market road?|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/5065822.html |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date=August 18, 2007 |accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Angola Basin''' is located along the West African South Atlantic Margin which extends from [[Cameroon]] to [[Angola]].&lt;ref name=Relating&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beglinger|first1=Suzanne|last2=Doust|first2=Harry|last3=Cloetingh|first3=Sierd|title=Relating petroleum system and play development to basin evolution: West African South Atlantic basins|journal=[[Marine and Petroleum Geology]]|date=February 2012|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2011.08.008}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is characterized as a [[passive margin]] that began spreading in the south and then continued upwards throughout the basin.&lt;ref name="Structural comparison"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peron-Pinvidic|first1=Gwenn|last2=Manatschal|first2=Gianreto|last3=Osmundsen|first3=Per Terje|title=Structural comparison of archetypal Atlantic rifted margins: A review of observations and concepts|journal=Marine and Petroleum Geology|date=May 2013|volume=43|pages=21–47|doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2013.02.002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
This basin formed during the initial breakup of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] during the early [[Cretaceous]], creating the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and causing the formation of the Angola, [[Cape Basin|Cape]], and [[Argentine Basin|Argentine]] basins.&lt;ref name="Environmental 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naafs|first1=B.D.A.|last2=Pancost|first2=R.D.|title=Environmental conditions in the South Atlantic (Angola Basin) during the Early Cretaceous|journal=Organic Geochemistry|date=November 2014|volume=76|pages=184–193|doi=10.1016/j.orggeochem.2014.08.005}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is often separated into two units: the Lower Congo Basin, which lies in the northern region and the Kwanza Basin which is in the southern part of the Angola margin.&lt;ref name="Superposed deformation straddling" /&gt;
The Angola Basin is famous for its "Aptian Salt Basins," a thick layer of [[evaporites]] that has influenced topography of the basin since its deposition and acts as an important [[petroleum reservoir]].&lt;ref name="Tectonicstratigraphic development in the eastern Lower Congo" /&gt;

==Tectonic mechanisms==
[[File:Gravity spreading.png|thumb|Gravity spreading mechanism based on Peel 2014]]
Typically [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]] are described as having landward [[Extension (geology)|extension]], seaward [[Contraction (physics)|contraction]], and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]], however the order of events in this area are difficult to distinguish in such a clear-cut manner.&lt;ref name="Superposed deformation straddling" /&gt;
This is due to the fact that areas of the basin are superimposed upon one another, which some interpret to show pulses of deformation and [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]] that occur at irregular times and places.&lt;ref name="Superposed deformation straddling" /&gt;

===Gravity spreading===
The Angola Basin is also highly characterized by [[gravity]] spreading where energy is released when the center of gravity lowers as crustal material thins.&lt;ref name="The engines"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peel|first1=Frank J.|title=The engines of gravity-driven movement on passive margins: Quantifying the relative contribution of spreading vs. gravity sliding mechanisms|journal=Tectonophysics|date=October 2014|volume=633|pages=126–142|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2014.06.023}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
This spreading mechanism requires at least some deformation as opposed to the breakup of rigid blocks.&lt;ref name="The engines" /&gt;
Gravity spreading is also temporally linked to [[sediment]] deposition, so spreading rates should increase during times of high sediment deposition and decrease or halt when there is little to no sediment deposition.&lt;ref name="The engines" /&gt;
As a result, any accommodation space created as the margin continues to spread should be filled with sediments.&lt;ref name="The engines" /&gt;

===Salt tectonics===
The evaporite layer present within the basin is responsible for many topographic features that developed since its deposition as salt movement deforms the surrounding bedrock.&lt;ref name="Salt tectonic controls"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oluboyo|first1=A.P.|last2=Gawthorpe|first2=R.L.|last3=Bakke|first3=K.|last4=Hadler-Jacobsen|first4=F.|title=Salt tectonic controls on deep-water turbidite systems: Miocene, southwestern Lower Congo Basin, offshore Angola|journal=Basin Research|date=August 2014|volume=26|issue=4|pages=597–620|doi=10.1111/bre.12051}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The driving force behind [[salt tectonics]] is thought to be extension governed by gravity.&lt;ref name="Tectonicstratigraphic development in the eastern Lower Congo" /&gt;
As gravity spreading acts upon the salt layers it causes upslope extension and downslope contraction, which also explains many of the folds and features of the basin.&lt;ref name="Compressional salt tectonics (Angolan margin)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brun|first1=Jean-Pierre|last2=Fort|first2=Xavier|title=Compressional salt tectonics (Angolan margin)|journal=Tectonophysics|date=April 2004|volume=382|issue=3-4|pages=129–150|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2003.11.014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Seismology|Seismic]] profiles taken from offshore Angola show many different salt structures such as [[diapirs]], clines, turtle features, and salt walls that show several deformation phases as the salt squeezes upwards when it is deposited upon.&lt;ref name="Superposed deformation straddling"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cramez|first1=C.|last2=Jackson|first2=M.P.A.|title=Superposed deformation straddling the continental-oceanic transition in deep-water Angola|journal=Marine and Petroleum Geology|date=December 2000|volume=17|issue=10|pages=1095–1109|doi=10.1016/s0264-8172(00)00053-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hudec|first1=H.R.|last2=Jackson|first2=M.P.A|title=Structural segmentation, inversion, and salt tectonics on a passive margin: Evolution of the Inner Kwanza Basin, Angola|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|date=October 2002|volume=114|issue=10|pages=1222–1244|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(2002)114&lt;1222:ssiast&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of the salt forms are associated with early Cretaceous folding and uplift as well as lateral shortening.&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics" /&gt;
One of the signature features in the Angola Basin are deep [[Trough (geology)|troughs]] that developed as salt dissolved, creating space for sediment fill.&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics" /&gt;
The troughs range from the beginning of the [[Eocene]] to the end of the [[Miocene]] depending on the time of dissolution.&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics" /&gt;

===Raft tectonics===
Post-rift deformation is predominantly caused by raft tectonics, a term that is associated with salt detachment when [[Fault (geology)|normal fault blocks]] are widely separated so that the footwall and hanging wall are not in contact, creating large [[graben]]s.&lt;ref name="Tectonicstratigraphic development in the eastern Lower Congo" /&gt; 
It is considered one of the most extreme forms of extension, and it highly influenced by gravity spreading and increased sediment loading, major factors which act upon the Angola Basin.&lt;ref name="Tectonicstratigraphic development in the eastern Lower Congo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raft Tectonics in Kwanza"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duval|first1=Bernard|last2=Cramez|first2=Carlos|last3=Jackson|first3=M.P.A.|title=Raft Tectonics in the Kwanza Basin, Angola|journal=Marine and Petroleum Geology|date=August 1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=389–404|doi=10.1016/0264-8172(92)90050-o}}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the basin this tectonic mechanism is attributed to three periods of high [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] that occurred at approximately 96, 28, and 10 million years ago, and the most recent high strain activity is still ongoing.&lt;ref name="Tectonicstratigraphic development in the eastern Lower Congo" /&gt;
These high strain rates lasted anywhere from 15 to 36 million years while rafting itself lasted from 7-10 million years.&lt;ref name="Tectonicstratigraphic development in the eastern Lower Congo" /&gt;

==Geologic history==
[[File:New Cretaceous.jpg|thumb|Overview of the rifting in the Cretaceous, approximately 120 million years ago, and placement of salt deposits and the Walvis Ridge adapted from Naafs and Pancost 2014]]

===Mesozoic===
The formation of the Angola Basin can be divided into three phases of rifting which took place from approximately 145-113 million years ago from the Jurassic to the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name="The deep structure of the South Atlantic Kwanza Basin" /&gt;
Initial rifting is defined by widespread crustal thinning, normal faulting, and the subsidence of grabens that formed in the upper crust.&lt;ref name="The deep structure of the South Atlantic Kwanza Basin" /&gt;
This was followed by a second rifting phase which was dominated by lithospheric thinning.&lt;ref name="The deep structure of the South Atlantic Kwanza Basin" /&gt;
The final phase of rifting led to the breakup of the lithosphere, initiated seafloor spreading that still acts today, and resulted in the development of [[oceanic crust]].&lt;ref name="The deep structure of the South Atlantic Kwanza Basin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evolution of deep-water"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crosby|first1=A.G.|last2=White|first2=N.J.|last3=Edwards|first3=G.R.H.|last4=Thompson|first4=M.|last5=Corfield|first5=R.|last6=Mackay|first6=L.|title=Evolution of deep-water rifted margins: Testing depth dependent extensional models|journal=Tectonics|date=February 2011|volume=30|issue=1|doi=10.1029/2010tc002687|bibcode=2011Tecto..30.1004C}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rifting, [[salt]] deposited upon the preexisting bedrock.&lt;ref name="Structural comparison" /&gt;
The large amounts of salt in most of the basin make it difficult to determine structures and sedimentary deposits beneath it since seismic does not penetrate through it.&lt;ref name="Structural comparison" /&gt; 
Though the salt layer creates some ambiguity most agree that the bedrock is composed of volcanic [[basalt]]s which are likely a result of rifting or [[Precambrian]] [[crystalline]] rock.&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics" /&gt; 
There are two main theories for the environment which called for salt deposition. 
The first is that the environment was a shallow marine area which after anomalous subsidence events causes rapid salt accumulation.&lt;ref name="Evolution of deep-water" /&gt; 
The second hypothesis claims that salt filled a topographic depression much further below [[sea level]].&lt;ref name="Evolution of deep-water" /&gt;
Despite which theory may be correct, it is generally agreed that the basin must have been very restricted from the ocean which allowed the evaporite deposits to be nearly three kilometers thick.&lt;ref name="Environmental 2" /&gt;

After the salt layer was deposited it was covered by a [[carbonate]] layer approximately 112 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Structural comparison" /&gt; 
The carbonate formation occurred due to large-scale anoxic events which created organic-rich [[shale]]s.&lt;ref name="Environmental 2" /&gt;
During this time the basin was [[hypersaline]] making it inhospitable for normal marine life, although there may have been a small but stable amount of input of terrestrial fresh water.&lt;ref name="Environmental 2" /&gt;
The source of this freshwater as well as [[Clastic rock|clastic debris]] was likely from the [[Kouilou-Niari River]] which is located in present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].&lt;ref name="Evidence of a large upper-Cretaceous" /&gt;
As the rift continued to spread apart Pangaea into the [[South America]]n and [[Africa]]n continents, the Angola Basin opened up further, allowing for better ocean circulation which balanced out the extreme hypersaline conditions to allow for life to develop in the area.&lt;ref name="Environmental 2" /&gt;
Towards the end of the Cretaceous the [[Congo River]] began to fill the basin with [[terrigenous]] sediments, characterized by many [[Turbidite|turbidite deposits]] which replaced most of the carbonate deposits.&lt;ref name="Evidence of a large upper-Cretaceous" /&gt;

===Cenozoic===
The Congo River created a much larger impact upon the basin in the [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref name="Evidence of a large upper-Cretaceous"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anka|first1=Zahie|last2=Seranne|first2=Michel|last3=di Primio|first3=Rolando|title=Evidence of a large upper-Cretaceous depocentre across the Continent-Ocean boundary of the Congo-Angola Basin. Implications for palaeo-drainage and potential ultra-deep source rocks|journal=Marine and Petroleum Geology|date=March 2010|volume=27|issue=3|pages=601–611|doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2009.08.015}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The sedimentary fill from the Congo River created a large [[Abyssal fan|deep-sea fan]] where the river enters the ocean, and this fan is still one of the basin's most predominant features.&lt;ref name="Evidence of a large upper-Cretaceous" /&gt;
The Oligocene is also characterized by an erosional event that lasted 10-20 million years that is thought to be controlled by upheavals or depressions of crust over a broad area that are caused by mantle convection and hotsopt activity.&lt;ref name="Tectonicstratigraphic development in the eastern Lower Congo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valle|first1=Paul J.|last2=Gjelberg|first2=John G.|last3=Helland-Hansen|first3=William|title=Tectonostratigraphic development in the eastern Lower Congo Basin, offshore Angola, West Africa|journal=Marin and Petroleum Geology|date=September 2001|volume=18|issue=8|pages=909–927|doi=10.1016/s0264-8172(01)00036-8}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the [[Quaternary]] to present day much of the sediment is influenced by the [[Walvis Ridge]], a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] trail that extends several hundred kilometers off the coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean, in addition to the Congo River.&lt;ref name="Sedimentation in the Angola and Cape"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sval'nov|first1=V.N.|last2=Dmitrenko|first2=O.B.|last3=Kazarina|first3=G.Kh.|last4=Berezhnaya|first4=E.D.|title=Sedimentation in the Angola and Cape basins during the Quaternary|journal=Lithology and Mineral Resources|date=July 2014|volume=49|issue=4|pages=281–291|doi=10.1134/s0024490214030067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walvis Ridge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Walvis Ridge MV1203 Expedition: Understanding 130 Million Years of Hotspot Volcanism in the SE Atlantic|url=http://earthref.org/ERESE/projects/MV1203/details.htm|website=earthref.org|publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this time the [[carbonate compensation depth]], the depth at which [[Calcium carbonate|carbonates]] dissolve, is at a minimum depth of 5400 m, over 1000 meters more than the average depth.&lt;ref name="Sedimentation in the Angola and Cape" /&gt;
This is due to the Walvis Ridge preventing cold Antarctic bottom waters from circulating the basin allowing for the sedimentation of carbonate materials, including microorganisms such as [[foraminifera]] and other calcareous [[microfossils]].&lt;ref name="Sedimentation in the Angola and Cape" /&gt;
The Angola Basin is currently well circulated by warm and cold surface currents and undercurrents and is mostly influenced by the Benguela Current, the Equatorial Countercurrents, and the Angola Current.&lt;ref name="Late Quaternary currents"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=R.R.|last2=Muller|first2=P.J.|last3=Ruhland|first3=G.|title=Late Quaternary surface circulation in the East Equatorial South-Atlantic - Evidence from alkenone sea-surface temperatures|journal=Paleoceanography|date=April 1995|volume=10|issue=2|pages=197–219|doi=10.1029/94pa03308|bibcode=1995PalOc..10..197S}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subbasins==

===Lower Congo Basin===
[[File:NEW FAN XSECTION.jpg|thumb|500x400px|Cross section of the Angola Basin submarine fan from the southwest oceanwards end to the northeart onshore end adapted from Jiang, Wang, and Zheng 2014]]
The Lower Congo Basin lies in the northern region of the Angola Basin and is largely identified by a sedimentary fan that is fueled by the Congo River and is part of the Ogooue Delta.&lt;ref name=Relating /&gt;
While the fan is dated to the Oligocene, initial sediment deposition which the fan developed on began in the Cretaceous and contains some of the Aptain salt layer.&lt;ref name="Genetic Stratigraphy" /&gt;
This fan is one of the largest marine fans in the world as it covers 300,000 square kilometers leading from the mouth of the river into the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name="The long-term"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anka|first1=Zahie|last2=Seranne|first2=Michel|last3=Lopez|first3=Michel|last4=Scheck-Wenderoth|first4=Magdalena|last5=Savoye|first5=Bruna|title=The long-term evolution of the Congo deep-sea fan: A basin-wide view of the interaction between a giant submarine fan and a mature passive margin (ZaiAngo project)|journal=Tectonophysics|date=May 2009|volume=470|issue=1-2|pages=42–56|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2008.04.009}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the fan is mainly composed of turbidite deposits composed for large amounts of sandstone and fine grained muds, it is likely an area that is currently generating [[hydrocarbons]] and probably has been for the past 30 million years.&lt;ref name=Relating /&gt;
This feature is highly dominated by gravity flows where sediment and fluid flow down slope due to gravity.&lt;ref name="Genetic Stratigraphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Zhenglong|last2=Wang|first2=Rong|last3=Zheng|first3=Wenbo|title=Genetic stratigraphy of a part of the Miocene Congo Fan, West Africa|journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences|date=July 2014|volume=95|pages=138–144|doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.03.005}}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kwanza Basin===
The Kwanza Basin lies in the lower region of the Angola Basin and can be divided into the inner and outer Kwanza Basins, with the inner basin lying closer to the continent of Africa and the outer basin surrounding the inner basin.&lt;ref name="Superposed deformation straddling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics" /&gt;
Basement structures separate the inner and outer areas of the basin; these structures are named the Flamingo, Ametista, and Benguela Platforms which comprises the Atlantic hinge zone.&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The deep structure of the South Atlantic Kwanza Basin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Nicolai|first1=C.|last2=Scheck-Wenderoth|first2=M.|last3=Warsitzka|first3=M.|last4=Schodt|first4=N.|last5=Andersen|first5=J.|title=The deep structure of the South Atlantic Kwanza Basin - Insights from 3D structural and gravimetric modelling|journal=Tectonophysics|date=September 2013|volume=604|pages=139–152|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2013.06.016}}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
These are areas where the signature salt layer is very thin or absent from the stratigraphic record.&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics" /&gt;
The basin's topographic features are mainly affected by salt tectonics, since the salt in most areas was originally over one kilometer thick.&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics" /&gt;
There are two main types of salt structures found in the inner Kwanza Basin: narrow salt walls which developed from salt-cored folds, and broad salt walls that formed likely due to major uplift in the area.&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics" /&gt;
Many of the salt features dissolved over time which led to the development of sedimentary troughs in the Cenozoic, although fewer troughs did develop as a result of extension.&lt;ref name="Structural segmentation, inversion, salt tectonics" /&gt;

==Hydrocarbons==
The basin houses economically important hydrocarbon reservoirs that serve as a source of [[petroleum]].&lt;ref name="Tectonicstratigraphic development in the eastern Lower Congo" /&gt;
Hydrocarbon generation in the Angola Basin is still an ongoing process that began in the late Cretaceous after the deposition of the thick salt beds.&lt;ref name=Relating /&gt;
The salt is an important feature in preserving hydrocarbons as it seals in the reservoir and prevents it from escaping into the open water.&lt;ref name=Relating /&gt;
Successful hydrocarbon collection within the Angola margin is associated with pockmarks within the topography that are formed as gas or subsurface water travels upwards through the water column.&lt;ref name="Physical and Chemical characterization of g  as hydrates"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charlou|first1=J.L.|last2=Donval|first2=J.P.|last3=Fouquet|first3=Y.|last4=Ondreas|first4=H.|last5=Knoery|first5=J.|last6=Cochonat|first6=P.|last7=Levache|first7=D.|last8=Poirier|first8=Y.|last9=Jean-Baptiste|first9=P.|last10=Fourre|first10=E.|last11=Chazallon|first11=B.|title=Physical and chemical characterization of gas hydrates and associated methane plumes in the Congo-Angola Basin|journal=Chemical Geology|date=May 2004|volume=205|issue=3-4|pages=405–425|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2003.12.033}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2000 a research expedition collected gas hydrate specimens from one of the world's largest pockmarks located in the Congo-Angola Basin.&lt;ref name="Physical and Chemical characterization of g  as hydrates" /&gt;
The depression was 800 meters in diameter and located 3160 meters below sea level and developed as a result of several smaller pockmarks collapsing into each other.&lt;ref name="Physical and Chemical characterization of g  as hydrates" /&gt;
The majority of the hydrocarbons found were gas hydrates composed of 100% [[methane]].&lt;ref name="Physical and Chemical characterization of g  as hydrates" /&gt;

'''Annexation''' ([[Latin]] ''ad'', to, and ''nexus'', joining) is the administrative action&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; and concept in [[international law]] relating to the forcible acquisition of one state's territory by another state.&lt;ref name=Hofmann-i/&gt; It is generally held to be an illegal act.&lt;ref name=Hofmann-i&gt;{{harvnb|Hofmann|2013|p=i}}: "Annexation means the forcible acquisition of territory by one State at the expense of another State. It is one of the principal modes of acquiring territory... in contrast to acquisition a) of terra nullius by means of effective occupation accompanied by the intent to appropriate the territory; b) by cession as a result of a treaty concluded between the States concerned (Treaties), or an act of adjudication, both followed by the effective peaceful transfer of territory; c) by means of prescription defined as the legitimization of a doubtful title to territory by passage of time and presumed acquiescence of the former sovereign; d) by accretion constituting the physical process by which new land is formed close to, or becomes attached to, existing land. Under present international law, annexation no longer constitutes a legally admissible mode of acquisition of territory as it violates the prohibition of the threat or use of force. Therefore annexations must not be recognized as legal."&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from [[Conquest (military)|conquest]], which refers to the acquisition of control over a territory involving a change of [[sovereignty]],&lt;ref name="MaxPlanck Conquest"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcelo G Kohen|editor1=Frauke Lachenmann|editor2=Rüdiger Wolfrum|chapter=Conquest|title=The Law of Armed Conflict and the Use of Force: The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=boWuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289|year=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-878462-3|pages=289|quote=Conquest and annexation are not synonymous either. The latter term is used within and outside the context of armed conflicts, to designate a unilateral decision adopted by a State in order to extent its sovereignty over a given territory. In many cases, the effective occupation of a terra nullius was followed by a declaration of annexation, in order to incorporate the territory under the sovereignty of the acquiring State. In the context of armed conflicts, annexation is the case in which the victorious State unilaterally declares that it is henceforth sovereign over the territory having passed under its control as a result of hostilities. This attempt at producing a transfer of sovereignty through the exclusive decision of the victor is not generally recognized as valid, both in classical and in contemporary international law. An example of a case of annexation preceding the adoption of the UN Charter is the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1908. The annexation was not recognized by the major Powers and required a modification of the 1878 Treaty of Berlin which had simply granted Austria-Hungary the right to administer the territory. Another example is the annexation of Ethiopia by Italy in 1936. Examples of purported contemporary annexations are the Golan Heights annexed by Israel in 1980 and Kuwait by Iraq in 1990, both declared null and void by the Security Council, or the incorporation of Crimea and the City of Sebastopol in the Russian Federation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohen, p.288, refers to clause 101 of the PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE, 1933, April 5th, General List: No. 43. TWENTY-SIXTH SESSION, LEGAL STATUS OF EASTERN GREENLAND: "Conquest only operates as a cause of loss of sovereignty when there is war between two States and by reason of the defeat of one of them sovereignty over territory passes from the loser to the victorious State."&lt;/ref&gt; and differs from [[cession]], in which territory is given or sold through treaty, since annexation is a unilateral act where territory is seized and held by one state.&lt;ref name=EB-Annexation/&gt; It usually follows [[military occupation]] of a territory.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt;

Annexation can be legitimized via general recognition by international bodies (i.e. other countries and intergovernmental organisations).&lt;ref name=EB-Annexation&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Annexation|volume=2|page=73|first=Thomas|last=Barclay|authorlink=Thomas Barclay (economic writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annexation|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/26334/annexation|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=20 March 2014|quote=Unlike cession, whereby territory is given or sold through treaty, annexation is a unilateral act made effective by actual possession and legitimized by general recognition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{harvnb|Rothwell|Kaye|Akhtarkhavari|Davis|2014|p=360}}: "Annexation is distinct from cession. Instead of a State seeking to relinquish territory, annexation occurs when the acquiring State asserts that it now holds the territory. Annexation will usual follow a military occupation of a territory, when the occupying power decides to cement its physical control by asserting legal title. The annexation of territory is essentially the administrative action associated with conquest. Mere conquest alone is not enough, but rather the conquering State must assert it is now sovereign over the territory concerned. For example, the defeat of Germany and Japan in 1945 led to their occupation by the Allies for a number of years, but the States themselves were not absorbed by the Allied Powers part of their respective territories. Examples of annexation in contemporary practice are not common, and are generally viewed as illegal."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of international law==
===Acquisition of title===
International law regarding the [[use of force by states]] has evolved significantly in the 20th century.{{sfn|Jennings|Kohen|2017|p=80}} Key agreements include the 1907 [[Porter Convention]], the 1920 [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] and the 1928 [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]],{{sfn|Jennings|Kohen|2017|p=80}} culminating in Article 2(4) of [[Chapter I of the United Nations Charter]], which is [[Coming into force|in force]] today: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations".{{sfn|Jennings|Kohen|2017|p=80}} Since the use of force against territorial integrity or political independence is illegal, the question as to whether [[Title (property)|title]] or [[sovereignty]] can be transferred in such a situation has been the subject of legal debate.{{sfn|Jennings|Kohen|2017|p=81}}

It is generally held that countries are under obligation to abide by the [[Stimson Doctrine]] that a state: "cannot admit the legality of any situation de facto nor... recognize any treaty or agreement entered into between those Governments... not... recognize any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the covenants and obligations of the Pact of Paris of August 27, 1928".{{sfn|Hofmann|2013|p=ii|ps=: "...States are under a legal obligation to abide by the Stimson Doctrine and not to recognize as lawful territorial changes effected by means of annexation. Moreover, even the annexation of the entire territory of a State does not result in the automatic extinction of that State as a subject of international law notwithstanding that it no longer has the capacity to act as such since it cannot exercise sovereign and effective control over any territory."}}

These principles were reconfirmed by the 1970 [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2625|Friendly Relations Declaration]].{{sfn|Aust|2010|p=36}}

===Protection of civilians===
During [[World War II]], the use of annexation deprived whole populations of the safeguards provided by [[international law]]s governing [[military occupation]]s.

The [[Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention (GCIV)]] of 1949 amplified the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] with respect to the question of the protection of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949.  Commentary - Art. 47. Part III : Status and treatment of protected persons #Section III : Occupied territories|url=https://www.icrc.org/ihl/COM/380-600054?OpenDocument|work=ICRC|accessdate=20 March 2014|quote=it was obvious that they were in fact always subservient to the will of the Occupying Power. Such practices were incompatible with the traditional concept of occupation (as defined in Article 43 of the Hague Regulations of 1907)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] made a point of giving the rules regarding inviolability of rights "an absolute character",&lt;ref name="Commentary on GCIV"&gt;Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949.[https://www.icrc.org/ihl/COM/380-600054?OpenDocument Commentary on Part III : Status and treatment of protected persons #Section III : Occupied territories Art. 47] by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]&lt;/ref&gt; thus making it much more difficult for a state to bypass international law through the use of annexation.&lt;ref name="Commentary on GCIV"/&gt; GCIV [[Wikisource:Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 47|Article 47]], in the first paragraph in Section III: Occupied territories, restricted the effects of annexation on the rights of persons within those territories:
{{quotation|Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.}}

==Examples since 1949==

===Portuguese India===
{{main|Annexation of Portuguese India}}
[[File:Portugease India.png|thumb|upright=0.95|[[Portuguese India]] in 1961]]
In 1954, the residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], a Portuguese [[enclave]] within India, ended Portuguese rule with the help of nationalist volunteers. From 1954 to 1961, the territory enjoyed ''de facto'' independence. In 1961, the territory was merged with India after its government signed an agreement with the Indian government.

In 1961, [[India]] and [[Portugal]] engaged in a brief military conflict over Portuguese-controlled [[Goa]] and [[Daman and Diu]]. India invaded and conquered the areas after 36 hours of fighting, ending 451 years of Portuguese colonial rule in India. The action was viewed in India as a liberation of historically Indian territory; in Portugal, however, the loss of both enclaves was seen as a national tragedy. A condemnation of the action by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) was vetoed by the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/5033 |title=The United Nations Security Council S/5033 |publisher=www.un.org |date= |accessdate=17 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goa and Daman and Diu were incorporated into India.

===Sikkim===
{{Main article|Sikkim}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Nathu La pass-map PL.svg|thumb|180px|The strategic importance of [[Sikkim]] was realized in 1960s during the [[Sino-Indian War]]]]
During the [[British Indian Empire|British colonial rule]] in India, Sikkim had an ambiguous status, as an Indian [[princely state]] or as an Indian [[protectorate]]. Prior to Indian independence, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], acting as the leader of Executive Council, agreed that Sikkim would not be treated as an Indian state. Between 1947 and 1950, Sikkim enjoyed ''de facto'' independence. However, the Indian independence spurred popular political movements in Sikkim and the ruler [[Chogyal]] came under pressure. He requested Indian help to quell the uprising, which was offered. Subsequently, in 1950, India signed a treaty with Sikkim bringing it under its [[suzerainty]], and controlling its external affairs, defence, diplomacy and communications. A state council was established in 1955 to allow for constitutional government under the Sikkimese monarch. Meanwhile, trouble was brewing in the state after the [[Sikkim National Congress]] demanded fresh elections and greater representation for the [[Nepali people|Nepalese]]. In 1967 India and China went to war in Sikkim, [[Cho La incident]] where a Chinese occupation was attempted and repulsed. In 1973, riots in front of the palace led to a formal request for protection from India. The Chogyal was proving to be extremely unpopular with the people. In 1975, the ''Kazi'' (prime minister) appealed to the Indian Parliament for a change in Sikkim's status so that it could become a state of India. In April, the [[Indian Army]] moved into Sikkim, seizing the city of [[Gangtok]] and disarming the Palace Guards. A referendum was held in which 97.5% of the voting people (59% of the people entitled to vote) voted to join the Indian Union. A few weeks later, on May 16, 1975, Sikkim officially became the 22nd state of the Indian Union and the monarchy was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Did India have a right to annex Sikkim in 1975? |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19780430-did-india-have-a-right-to-annex-sikkim-in-1975-818651-2015-02-18 |work=[[India Today]] |date=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rockall===
[[File:Rockall Union flag hoisted 1955.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant Commander Desmond Scott hoists the [[Union Flag]] in 1955]]
On 18 September 1955 at precisely 10:16 am, in what would be the final territorial expansion of the [[British Empire]], [[Rockall]] was declared officially annexed by the British Crown when [[Lieutenant-Commander]] Desmond Scott [[Royal Navy|RN]], [[Sergeant]] Brian Peel [[Royal Marines|RM]], [[Corporal]] AA Fraser RM, and James Fisher (a civilian [[natural history|naturalist]] and former Royal Marine), were deposited on the island by a [[Royal Navy helicopter]] from {{HMS|Vidal}} (coincidentally named after the man who first charted the island). The team cemented in a brass plaque on Hall's Ledge and hoisted the [[Union Flag]] to stake the UK's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC staff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_4582000/4582327.stm |title=On this day: 21 September 1955: Britain claims Rockall |publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, any effect of this annexation on valuable maritime rights claims under [[UNCLOS]] in the waters beyond 12 nautical miles from Rockall are neither claimed by Britain nor recognised by Denmark (for the [[Faroe Islands]]), [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] or [[Iceland]].

===Western New Guinea===
{{Seealso|West New Guinea dispute}}
Following a [[Act of Free Choice|controversial plebiscite]] in 1969, [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] or Western New Guinea was annexed by [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/how-the-un-failed-west-papua/ How the UN Failed West Papua]". ''The Diplomat''. 19 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; West Paupa is the western half of the island of [[New Guinea]] and smaller islands to its west. The separatist [[Free Papua Movement]] (OPM) has engaged in a small-scale yet bloody conflict with the Indonesian military since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usyd.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=651 Report claims secret genocide in Indonesia – University of Sydney]&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Timor===
{{Main|Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesian occupation of East Timor}}
Following an Indonesian invasion in 1975, [[East Timor]] was annexed by Indonesia and was known as Timor Timur. It was regarded by Indonesia as the country's 27th province, but this was never recognised by the [[United Nations]]. The people of East Timor resisted Indonesian forces in a prolonged guerrilla campaign.

Following [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|a referendum]] held in 1999 under a [[UN]]-sponsored agreement between the two sides, the people of East Timor rejected the offer of autonomy within Indonesia. East Timor achieved independence in 2002 and is now officially known as [[East Timor|Timor-Leste]].

===Western Sahara===
{{main|Political status of Western Sahara}}
[[File:MoroccoWesternSaharaOMC.png|thumb|upright=0.85|Morocco officially annexed [[Western Sahara]] in 1976]]
In 1975, and following the [[Madrid Accords]] between [[Morocco]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Spain]], the latter withdrew from the territory and ceded the administration to Morocco and Mauritania. This was challenged by an [[Independence|independentist]] movement, the [[Polisario Front]] that waged a [[guerrilla war]] against both Morocco and Mauritania. In 1979, and after a military [[putsch]], Mauritania withdrew from the territory that left it controlled by Morocco. A [[United Nations]] peace process was initiated in 1991, but it has been stalled, and as of mid-2012, the UN is holding direct negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario front to reach a solution to the conflict.  The [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] is a [[List of states with limited recognition|partially recognized state]] that has claimed the entire region since 1975.

===West Bank===
{{main|Jordanian annexation of the West Bank}}
The part of former [[Mandatory Palestine]] [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|occupied by Jordan]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], which some Jews call "[[Judea and Samaria]]", was renamed "the [[West Bank]]". It was annexed to Jordan in 1950 at the request of a Palestinian delegation.&lt;ref name=jordan_annexation&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org.il/art/knesset6.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002213659/http://www.jcpa.org.il/art/knesset6.htm |date=October 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been questioned, however, how representative that delegation was, and at the insistence of the [[Arab League]], Jordan was considered a trustee only.&lt;ref name=Jordan_trustee&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/legsess.html Arab League Session: 12-II Date: May 1950]&lt;/ref&gt; Only the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Pakistan]] recognized the annexation by Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jerusalem: a city and its future | publisher=Syracuse University Press | author=Marshall J.

Jordan did not officially relinquish its claim to rule the West Bank until 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Historical Atlas of Jordan |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |first=Amy |last=Romano |year=2003 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lGEkKBs9UT4C&amp;pg=PA51 51] |isbn=978-0-8239-3980-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has not taken the step of annexing the territory (except for parts of it that was made part of the Jerusalem Municipality), rather, there were enacted a complex (and highly controversial) system of [[Israeli Military Order|military government decrees]] in effect applying Israeli law in many spheres to [[Israeli settlement]]s.

===East Jerusalem===
{{main|Jerusalem Law}}
During the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], [[Israel]] occupied [[East Jerusalem]], a part of the [[West Bank]], from [[Jordan]]. On June 27, 1967, Israel unilaterally extended its law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem and some of the surrounding area, incorporating about 70 square kilometers of territory into the Jerusalem Municipality. Although at the time Israel informed the [[United Nations]] that its measures constituted administrative and municipal integration rather than annexation, later rulings by the Israeli Supreme Court indicated that East Jerusalem had become part of Israel. In 1980, Israel passed the [[Jerusalem Law]] as part of its [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law]], which declared Jerusalem the "complete and united" capital of Israel. In other words, Israel purported to annex East Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Sela|Sela, Avraham]].  "Jerusalem." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  Ed. Avraham Sela.

[[File:Six Day War Territories.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Israel and the territories Israel occupied in the [[Six-Day War]].]]

Jewish neighborhoods have since been built in East Jerusalem, and Israeli Jews have since also settled in Arab neighborhoods there, though some Jews may have returned from their 1948 expulsion after the [[Battle for Jerusalem (1948)|Battle for Jerusalem]].
Only Costa Rica recognized Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem, and those countries who maintained embassies in Israel did not move them to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ian S. |last=Lustick |title=Has Israel Annexed East Jerusalem?| journal=Middle East Policy Council Journal|volume=5 |date=16 January 1997|number=1|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4967.1997.tb00247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United States Congress]] has passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]], which recognizes Jerusalem as the united capital of Israel and requires the relocation of the U.S. embassy there, but the bill has been waived by presidents [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], [[George W. Bush|Bush]], and [[Barack Obama|Obama]] on national security grounds. President Trump has begun the controversial process of moving the United States embassy to Jerusalem, but has not recognized the annexation of East Jerusalem.

===Golan Heights===
{{main|Golan Heights Law}}
Israel occupied two-thirds of the [[Golan Heights]] from [[Syria]] during the 1967 Six-Day War, and subsequently built Jewish settlements in the area. In 1981, Israel passed the [[Golan Heights Law]], which extended Israeli "law, jurisdiction, and administration" to the area, including the [[Shebaa farms]] area. This declaration was declared "null and void and without international legal effect" by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 497|UNSC Resolution 497]]. The only state that recognized the annexation is the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].

The vast majority of [[Druze#In Syria|Syrian Druze]] in [[Majdal Shams]], the largest Syrian village in the Golan, have held onto their Syrian passports. When Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, 95% of the Majdal Shams residents refused Israeli citizenship, and are still firmly of that opinion, in spite of the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria: 'We still feel Syrian,' say Druze of Golan Heights|url=http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/generalnews/2012/11/28/Syria-still-feel-Syrian-say-Druze-Golan-Heights_7869606.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 2012, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] reaffirmed it was "[d]eeply concerned that Israel has not withdrawn from the Syrian Golan, which has been under occupation since 1967, contrary to the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions," and "[s]tress[ed] the illegality of the Israeli settlement construction and other activities in the occupied Syrian Golan since 1967."&lt;ref name="UN Doc A/67/L.24"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Doc A/67/L.24|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/67/L.24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202060709/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2F67%2FL.24|archivedate=2012-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Assembly then voted by majority, 110 in favour to 6 against (Canada, Israel, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, United States), with 59 abstentions, to demand a full Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights.&lt;ref name="UN Doc A/67/L.24"/&gt;

===Kuwait===
{{main|Invasion of Kuwait}}
After being allied with [[Iraq]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (largely due to desiring Iraqi protection from [[Iran]]), [[Kuwait]] was [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] and [[Kuwait Governorate|annexed]] by [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] (under [[Saddam Hussein]]) in August 1990. Hussein's primary justifications included a charge that Kuwaiti territory was in fact an Iraqi province, and that annexation was retaliation for "economic warfare" Kuwait had waged through [[slant drilling]] into Iraq's oil supplies. The monarchy was deposed after annexation, and an Iraqi governor installed.

United States president [[George H. W. Bush]] ultimately condemned Iraq's actions, and moved to drive out Iraqi forces. Authorized by the UNSC, an American-led coalition of 34 nations fought the [[Gulf War]] to reinstate the [[Emir of Kuwait|Kuwaiti Emir]]. Iraq's invasion (and annexation) was deemed illegal and Kuwait remains an independent nation today.

===Crimea===
{{main|Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation}}
In March 2014, [[Russia]] annexed most of the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]], part of [[Ukraine]], and administers the territory as two [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] — the [[Republic of Crimea]] and the [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of [[Sevastopol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/724785|title=Putin signs laws on reunification of Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol with Russia|publisher=[[ITAR TASS]]|date=21 March 2014 |accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia rejects the view that this was an annexation and regard it as an accession to the Russian Federation of a [[Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Crimea|state that had just declared independence from Ukraine]] following a referendum, and considers [[secession]] as a result of [[irredentism]]. A term often used in Russia to describe these events is "re-unification" (воссоединение) to highlight the fact that Crimea was part of [[Russian Empire]] and later [[Russian SSR]].

===Antarctica===
{{main|Queen Maud Land}}
One example of a claimed annexation after [[World War II]] is the [[Kingdom of Norway]]'s southward expansion of the [[List of possessions of Norway|dependent territory]] [[Queen Maud Land]]. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the [[South Pole]] until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally claimed to have annexed that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ole Magnus |last=Rapp |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Norge-utvider-Dronning-Maud-Land-helt-frem-til-Sydpolen-8168779.html |title=Norge utvider Dronning Maud Land helt frem til Sydpolen - Aftenposten |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], however, states: "The treaty does not recognize, dispute, nor establish territorial sovereignty claims; no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;!-- OR unless the source quotes it in connection with this alleged annexation --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2412">'''Area code 441''' is the [[telephone]] [[area code]] for [[Bermuda]]. It was created by a split from the original [[area code 809]] on October 1, 1995, although permissive dialing continued until September 30, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JyxYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22area+code%22+441+1996&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Bermuda ''Toll-free Phone Book USA: A Directory of Toll-free Telephone Numbers for Business and Organizations Nationwide''], Kay Gill, Omnigraphics, 1997, page ix&lt;/ref&gt; When calling from countries and territories outside the [[North American Numbering Plan]], the area code is prefixed by the [[international access code]] and the [[country calling code|country code]] '''1'''; for example from the [[United Kingdom]], subscribers would dial '''00 1 441'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=c28nAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Bermuda+%2200+1+441%22&amp;dq=Bermuda+%2200+1+441%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjflNa296rMAhXJfhoKHRySAWIQ6AEIKzAA ''Maritime Guide''], The Register, 2001, page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 1999, each of the groups of the various Caribbean and Atlantic islands using the [[North American Numbering Plan]] area codes, which had previously shared [[area code 809]], was split off and given its own area code. 441 is among them. The 809 Area Code now exclusively serves the [[Dominican Republic]].

'''Baarle-Hertog''' ({{IPA-nl|ˌbaːrlə ˈɦɛrtɔx}}) also known as '''Baerle-Duc''' is a [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[municipality]] of [[Belgium]], much of which consists of a number of small Belgian [[exclave]]s in the [[Netherlands]].

While some of its territory consists of exclaves in the Dutch province of [[North Brabant]], it is part of the Belgian province of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]. On 1 January 2006 Baarle-Hertog had a population of 2,306. The total area is {{convert|7.48|km²|2|abbr=off}} which gives a [[population density]] of 308 inhabitants per km² (798&amp;nbsp;inhabitants/sq&amp;nbsp;mi).

==Geography==

===Border with Baarle-Nassau===
[[File:Baarle-Nassau - Baarle-Hertog-en.svg|thumb|Map showing the enclaves of Baarle-Hertog]]
Baarle-Hertog is noted for its complicated borders with [[Baarle-Nassau]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://fronterasblog.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/una-cerveceria-en-dos-paises/#more-1967 Map, pictures and infos on "Fronterasblog"]&lt;/ref&gt; The complex border was created after the [[Treaty of Maastricht (1843)|Treaty of Maastricht]] was signed between the Netherlands and Belgium in 1843. In total it consists of 24 separate parcels of land. The main division of Baarle-Hertog is [[Zondereigen]] (named after its main hamlet), located north of the Belgian town of [[Merksplas]]. In addition there are twenty Belgian [[exclave]]s in the Netherlands and three other sections on the Dutch-Belgian border. There are also seven Dutch exclaves within the Belgian exclaves (i.e., [[Enclaves and exclaves#Enclaves within enclaves|counter-exclaves]]). Six of these Dutch enclaves are located within the largest Belgian enclave, and a seventh in the second-largest Belgian enclave. An eighth Dutch exclave is located nearby [[Ginhoven]].

During [[World War I]], this situation meant that the German army could not occupy these parts of Belgium without crossing the [[Netherlands]], which the Dutch government did not allow.  Thus, these pieces of Belgium became a place where refugees could safely stay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/an-apology-of-enclaves/ An Apology of Enclaves]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A clandestine radio transmitter was smuggled in and from there worked with the Belgian resistance.  The Dutch government fenced off these areas and controlled access in or out of them, building a church and school for the Belgian people who were effectively stranded within the enclaves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclavegeschiedenis_van_Baarle#Baarle_en_de_Eerste_Wereldoorlog Enclavegeschiedenis van Baarle (Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt;  This situation did not exist in [[World War II]], as both countries were occupied by Germany.

Outside of Belgium and the Netherlands, there is at least one other national [[Enclaves and exclaves#Enclaves within enclaves|counter-exclave]] (enclave enclosed within an enclave) at [[Nahwa]], an enclave of the [[United Arab Emirates]] within an enclave of the [[Sultanate of Oman]] within the United Arab Emirates.

Some houses in the town of Baarle-Hertog/Baarle-Nassau are divided between the two countries. At one time, according to Dutch laws restaurants had to close earlier. For some restaurants on the border, this simply meant that the customers had to move to a table on the Belgian side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/11/the-curious-case-of-baarle-nassau-and.html |title=The Curious Case of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog |publisher=Amusingplanet.com |date=2012-11-06 |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The border's complexity results from a number of equally complex medieval treaties, agreements, land-swaps and sales between the Lords of [[Breda]] and the Dukes of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. Generally speaking, predominantly agricultural or built environments became constituents of Brabant and other parts devolved to Breda. These distributions were ratified and clarified as a part of the border settlements agreed under the [[Treaty of Maastricht (1843)|Treaty of Maastricht]] in 1843.

Many [[firework]]s shops are found in Baarle-Hertog, owing to Belgian laws controlling the sale of fireworks that are more lenient than those in the Netherlands. Close to the end of the year many Dutch tourists come to Baarle-Hertog to buy fireworks to celebrate the New Year.

Two villages in the municipality, [[Zondereigen]] and [[Ginhoven]], are located in the main territory of Belgium.

{{Other uses|Bura (disambiguation){{!}}Bura}}
{{For|the Asian wind whose name is derived from the same Turkic root|Buran (wind)}}
The '''bora''' is a northern to north-eastern [[katabatic wind]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Similar nomenclature is used for north-eastern winds in other littoral areas of eastern [[Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]] basins.

==Name==
It is known in [[Greek language|Greek]] as {{lang|el|μπόρα}} (''mpóra'', pronounced ''bora'') and Italian as {{lang|it|bora}}. In English, the name ''bora'' is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bora|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bora|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stefano Zecchetto|author2=Francesco De Biasio|author3=Marco Bajo|editor1-last=Fletcher|editor1-first=Caroline A.|editor2-last=Spencer|editor2-first=Tom|title=Flooding and Environmental Challenges for Venice and Its Lagoon: State of Knowledge|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=53–58|chapter=Features of Scatterometer Wind Observations in the Adriatic Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Serbo-Croatian]] name {{lang|sh|bura}} (бура) and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] {{lang|sl|burja}} are not etymologically related to ''bora''; they derive from Common Slavic ''burja'' 'storm' (from the verb ''*burĭti'') and the meaning 'bora' developed later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snoj|first1=Marko|title=Slovenski etimološki slovar|date=2003|publisher=Modrijan|location=Ljubljana|isbn=961-6465-37-6|page=66|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same root as ''bora'' is found in the name of the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]] (Βορέας), the North Wind.  Historical linguists speculate that the name may derive from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''gworh''- meaning "mountain" and giving rise to Germanic ''burg'' and ''berg''.&lt;ref name="MalloryAdams2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. P. Mallory|author2=D. Q. Adams|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pH7emh7sv50C&amp;pg=PA121|date=24 August 2006|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-928791-8|pages=121–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar pattern is seen in the cognate name of the ''[[Buran (wind)|buran]]'' winds of central Asia and the name ''purga'' of their Siberian subtype.

== Features ==
[[File:Bora on Molo Audace.jpg|thumb|right|The bora on Molo Audace in [[Trieste]], February 2011]]  The changeable bora can often be felt all over [[Montenegrin Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Istria]], [[Rijeka]], the [[Slovenian Littoral]], [[Trieste]], and the rest of the  Adriatic east coast. It blows in gusts. The bora is most common during the winter. It blows hardest, as the meteorologist Baron  [[Ferdinand von Wrangel]] explained it by extending [[Julius Hann]]'s explanation of Alpine katabatic winds to the north Adriatic,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--posthumously published?--&gt; F. von Wrangel, "Die Ursachen der Bora in Noworossisk", ''Repertorium für Meteorologie'' '''40''' (1876:238-40); the bora of the Karst was described by F. Seidel, "Bermerkungen über die Karstbora", ''''M.Z.'' '''8''' (1891:232-35), noted by Julius (von) Hann, ''Handbook of Climatology'' [[Robert DeCourcy Ward]], tr. (1903): see [http://www.meteohistory.org/2004polling_preprints/docs/abstracts/seibert_abstract.pdf Petra Seibert, "Hann’s Thermodynamic Foehn  In the Adriatic tradition, the bora comes from three mouths: Trieste, Rijeka and Senj.  Theory and its Presentation in Meteorological Textbooks in the Course of Time"].&lt;/ref&gt; when a polar high-pressure area sits over the snow-covered mountains of the interior plateau behind the Dinaric coastal mountain range and a calm low-pressure area lies further south over the warmer [[Adriatic]]. As the air grows even colder and thus denser at night, the bora increases. Its initial temperature is so low that even with the warming occasioned by its descent it reaches the lowlands as a cold wind.&lt;ref&gt;v. Hann 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; The wind takes two different traditional names in areas of Italy depending on associated meteorological conditions: the "light bora" ({{lang-it|bora chiara}}) is a bora in the presence of clear skies, whereas clouds gathering on the hilltops and moving towards the seaside with rain or snow characterize the "dark bora" (''bora scura'').

== Areas hit ==
[[File:Senj riva 09022012 004.jpg|thumb|[[Senj]] during the [[Early 2012 European cold wave|Eastern European cold wave]]]]
[[File:Kraška burja-Valvasor.jpg|thumb|The bora on the [[Karst Plateau]], depicted in  [[Janez Vajkard Valvasor|Valvasor]]'s ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'', 17th century]]

The area where some of the strongest bora winds occur is the [[Velebit]] mountain range in [[Croatia]]. This seaside mountain chain, spanning 145 kilometers, represents a huge weather and climatic divide between the sharp [[continental climate]] of the interior, characterized by significant day/night temperature differences throughout the year, and the Adriatic coast, with a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The bora occurs because these two divided masses tend to equalize&lt;!--this needs improving--&gt;. Sailing during the bora can be challenging and it requires caution, regarding readiness of both the boat and its crew. Short, high waves with white crests are its characteristics, making the navigation difficult. The small drops formed by the wind create a so-called "sea smoke" that reduces the visibility significantly. Experienced seamen have a proverb: "When the bora sails, you don't!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailingeurope.com/en/yacht-charter-in/croatia/wind|title=Croatia Wind - Sailing tips - Sailing Europe|website=SailingEurope}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sailing can be extremely dangerous for an unexperienced navigator in the Velebit channel because the wind can start suddenly on a clear and calm day and result in major problems, frequently also affecting road traffic. Near the towns of [[Senj]], [[Stara Novalja]], [[Karlobag]] and the southern portal of the [[Sveti Rok Tunnel]] in Croatia, it can reach speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour. On 21 December 1998 the speed of a gust on the [[Maslenica Bridge (A1)|Maslenica Bridge]] (north of [[Zadar]]) was measured at a record speed of 248 kilometres per hour.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bajić, B. Peroš, V. Vučetić, Z. Žibrat, Wind load - a meteorological basis for Croatian standards, GRAĐEVINAR 53 (2001), page 501, (in Croatian); http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/18613&lt;/ref&gt; During 22 to 25 December 2003 on [[A1 (Croatia)|A1 highway]] near Sveti Rok Tunnel a new record was measured at a speed of 304 kilometers per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novine.novilist.hr/default.asp?WCI=Rubrike&amp;WCU=285A285F28632859285A2863285A28582858285B286328962897289E286328632860285C285A2859285828632863286328582863M|title=Pretplati se &gt; Novi list - Online izdanje|website=novine.novilist.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, during the [[Early 2012 European cold wave|Eastern European Cold Wave]], the shoreline in Senj froze and snow piled up after a 150&amp;nbsp;km/h bora plummeted the temperature to −14&amp;nbsp;°C, with waves of 7 metres. The bora ripped the trees from the soil and destroyed roofs of houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/pogledajte-kako-je-jucer-bilo-u-senju-bura-nosi-sve-pred-sobom-dize-cak-i-krovove/598037.aspx|title=Pogledajte kako je jučer bilo u Senju: Bura nosi sve pred sobom, diže čak i krovove!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the island of Pag, the Bora threw fish out of the sea. In many Croatian coastal cities, fresh water froze inside the pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24sata.hr/news/karlobag-odsjecen-a-u-senju-bura-cupa-krovove-i-nosi-cigle-252881|title=Bura izbacuje ribu na obalu, u riječkoj bolnici selili pacijente|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wind is also an integral feature of Slovenia's [[Vipava Valley]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Karst Plateau]] (known as ''Carso'' in Italian), an area of limestone heights over the [[Gulf of Trieste]] stretching towards the [[Istria]]n peninsula. Because the region separates the lower Adriatic coast from the [[Julian Alps]] range, extreme bora winds often occur there. They have influenced the region's traditional lifestyle and architecture. Towns on the coast, where the bora frequently occurs, are built densely with narrow streets in part because of the wind. Buildings in several towns and villages in [[Slovenia]] and the [[Province of Trieste]] ([[Italy]]) have stones on their roofs to prevent the tiles from being blown off. Chains and ropes are occasionally stretched along the sidewalks in downtown [[Trieste]], Italy, to facilitate pedestrian traffic &amp;mdash; gusts in the city are usually above 120&amp;nbsp;km/h reaching to maxima of near 200&amp;nbsp;km/h. A strong bora will often be reported on Italian television news. Slovenian towns where the strongest bora occurs are [[Ajdovščina]], [[Vipava, Slovenia|Vipava]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Nova Gorica]]. In Slovenia, the most affected section is usually the upper part of the Vipava Valley, stretching from Ajdovščina to [[Podnanos]], where the speed of the wind can exceed 200&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zurnal24.si/za-ajdovci-mirna-noc-pred-njimi-vetroven-dan-clanek-147460|title=Ekipe so v stalni pripravljenosti|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Novorossiysk, 1997.jpg|thumb|After bora catastrophe, [[Novorossiysk]] 1997]]
Strong bora winds also occur in the [[Tsemes Bay]] of the [[Black Sea]] near the Russian port of [[Novorossiysk]], where they are known as nordost ("northeastern").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vydrenkov.com/index.html|title=A book about bora|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can reach speeds of up to 220 kilometres per hour.

'''Building material''' is any material which is used for [[construction]] purposes.  Many naturally occurring substances, such as [[clay]], rocks, [[sand]], and [[wood]], even twigs and leaves, have been used to construct [[building]]s. Apart from naturally occurring materials, many man-made products are in use, some more and some less synthetic. The manufacturing of building materials is an established industry in many countries and the use of these materials is typically segmented into specific specialty trades, such as [[carpentry]], [[Building insulation|insulation]], [[plumbing]], and [[roofing material|roofing]] work. They provide the make-up of [[:Category:Human habitats|habitats]] and [[architecture|structures]] including [[home]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"building" def. 2 and 4, "material" def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0)© Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==The total cost of building materials==
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
In history there are trends in building materials from being natural to becoming more man-made and [[Composite material|composite]]; biodegradable to imperishable; indigenous (local) to being transported globally; repairable to disposable; chosen for increased levels of fire-safety, and improved [[seismic]] resistance.. These trends tend to increase the ''initial'' and ''long term'' economic, ecological, energy, and social costs of building materials.

===Economic costs===
Initial economic cost of building materials is the purchase price. This is often what governs decision making about what materials to use. Sometimes people take into consideration the energy savings or durability of the materials and see the value of paying a higher initial cost in return for a lower lifetime cost. For example, an asphalt shingle roof costs less than a metal roof to install, but the metal roof will last longer so the lifetime cost is less per year. Some materials may require more care than others, maintaining costs specific to some materials may also influence the final decision. Risks when considering lifetime cost of a material is if the building is damaged such as by fire or wind, or if the material is not as durable as advertised. The cost of materials should be taken into consideration to bear the risk to buy combustive materials to enlarge the lifetime. It is said that, 'if it must be done, it must be done well'.

===Ecological costs===
{{main|Ecological footprint}}
Pollution costs can be macro and micro. The macro, environmental pollution of extraction industries building materials rely on such as mining, petroleum, and logging produce environmental damage at their source and in transportation of the raw materials, manufacturing, transportation of the products, retailing, and installation. An example of the micro aspect of pollution is the off-gassing of the building materials in the building or [[indoor air pollution]]. [[Red List building materials]] are materials found to be harmful. Also the [[carbon footprint]], the total set of greenhouse gas emissions produced in the life of the material. A [[life-cycle analysis]] also includes the [[Deconstruction (building)|reuse]], recycling, or disposal of [[construction waste]]. Two concepts in building which account for the [[ecological economics]] of building materials are [[green building]] and [[sustainable development]].

===Energy costs===
the Initial energy costs include the amount of energy consumed to produce, deliver and install the material. The long term energy cost is the economic, ecological, and social costs of continuing to produce and deliver energy to the building for its use, maintenance, and eventual removal. The initial [[embodied energy]] of a structure is the energy consumed to extract, manufacture, deliver, install, the materials. The lifetime embodied energy continues to grow with the use, maintenance, and reuse/recycling/disposal of the building materials themselves ''and'' how the materials and design help minimize the life-time energy consumption of the structure.

===Social costs===
Social costs are injury and health of the people producing and transporting the materials and potential health problems of the building occupants if there are problems with the [[building biology]]. Globalization has had significant impacts on people both in terms of jobs, skills, and self-sufficiency are lost when manufacturing facilities are closed and the cultural aspects of where new facilities are opened. Aspects of [[fair trade]] and [[labor rights]] are social costs of global building material manufacturing.

==Naturally occurring substances==

===Brush===
[[File:View of a group of Mohaves in a brush hut, one man very emaciated, entitled, by Wittick, Ben, 1845-1903.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Mohave people|Mohaves]] in a brush hut]]
[[Branches|Brush]] structures are built entirely from plant parts and were used in primitive cultures such as Native Americans and &lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, Peter, and Robert Easton. ''Native American architecture''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989. 16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[pygmy peoples]] in Africa&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Susan. ''Domestic architecture and the use of space: an interdisciplinary cross-cultural study''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990. 131.Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These are built mostly with branches, twigs and leaves, and bark, similar to a [[beaver]]'s lodge. These were variously named [[wikiup]]s, lean-tos, and so forth.

An extension on the brush building idea is the [[wattle and daub]] process in which clay soils or [[feces|dung]], usually [[cow]], are used to fill in and cover a woven brush structure. This gives the structure more thermal mass and strength. Wattle and daub is one of the oldest building techniques.&lt;ref name=Shaffer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaffer |first=Gary D. |title=An Archaeomagnetic Study of a Wattle and Daub Building Collapse |journal=Journal of Field Archaeology |volume=20 |number=1 |date=Spring 1993 |pages=59–75 |jstor=530354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many older timber frame buildings incorporate wattle and daub as non load bearing walls between the timber frames.

===Ice and snow===
Snow and occasionally ice,&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, G. F.. ''The private journal of Captain G.F. Lyon, of H.M.S. Hecla, during the recent voyage of discovery under Captain Parry'' .... London: J. Murray, 1824. 280–281. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; were used by the [[Inuit]] peoples for [[igloo]]s and snow is used to build a shelter called a [[quinzhee]]. Ice has also been used for [[ice hotel]]s as a [[tourist attraction]] in northern climates.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Colin Michael, and Jarkko Saarinen. ''Tourism and change in polar regions: climate, environments and experiences''. Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon, England: Routledge, 2010. 30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mud and clay===
[[File:SkogarMuseumOutside.jpg|thumb|Sod buildings in Iceland]]

Clay based buildings usually come in two distinct types. One being when the walls are made directly with the mud mixture, and the other being walls built by stacking air-dried building blocks called [[Mudbrick|mud bricks]].

Other uses of clay in building is combined with straws to create [[light clay]], [[wattle and daub]], and mud [[plaster]].

====Wet-laid clay walls====
{{Main|rammed earth|sod|cob (building)}}
Wet-laid, or damp, walls are made by using the mud or clay mixture directly without forming blocks and drying them first. The amount of and type of each material in the mixture used leads to different styles of buildings. The deciding factor is usually connected with the quality of the [[soil]] being used. Larger amounts of [[clay]] are usually employed in building with ''cob'', while low-clay soil is usually associated with ''[[sod house]]'' or ''[[sod roof]]'' construction. The other main ingredients include more or less [[sand]]/[[gravel]] and [[straw]]/grasses. ''Rammed earth'' is both an old and newer take on creating walls, once made by compacting clay soils between planks by hand; nowadays [[formwork|forms]] and [[machine|mechanical]] [[pneumatic]] compressors are used.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;McHenry, Paul Graham. ''Adobe and rammed earth buildings: design and construction''. New York: Wiley, 1984. 104. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil, and especially clay, provides good [[thermal mass]]; it is very good at keeping temperatures at a constant level. Homes built with earth tend to be naturally cool in the summer heat and warm in cold weather. Clay holds heat or cold, releasing it over a period of time like stone. Earthen walls change temperature slowly, so artificially raising or lowering the temperature can use more resources than in say a wood built house, but the heat/coolness stays longer.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

People building with mostly dirt and clay, such as cob, sod, and adobe, created homes that have been built for centuries in western and northern Europe, Asia, as well as the rest of the world, and continue to be built, though on a smaller scale. Some of these buildings have remained habitable for hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. "Cob Building, Ancient and Modern," in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek, (2002), 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100416132054/http://www.takungpao.com/news/10/01/28/_IN-1208245.htm] Earliest Chinese building brick appeared in Xi'an (中國最早磚類建材在西安現身)]. takungpao.com (2010-1-28)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structural clay blocks and bricks====
{{Main|adobe|mudbrick|compressed earth block}}

''Mud-bricks'', also known by their Spanish name ''adobe'' are ancient building materials with evidence dating back thousands of years BC. ''Compressed earth blocks'' are a more modern type of brick used for building more frequently in [[industrialized society]] since the building blocks can be manufactured off site in a centralized location at a [[brickworks]] and transported to multiple building locations. These blocks can also be monetized more easily and sold.

Structural mud bricks are almost always made using clay, often clay soil and a binder are the only ingredients used, but other ingredients can include sand, lime, concrete, stone and other [[Binder (material)|binders]]. The formed or compressed block is then air dried and can be laid dry or with a mortar or [[clay slip]].

===Sand===
Sand is used with [[cement]], and sometimes [[Lime (material)|lime]], to make [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] for [[masonry]] work and [[plaster]]. Sand is also used as a part of the concrete mix. An important low-cost building material in countries with high sand content soils is the [[Sandcrete]] block, which is weaker but cheaper than fired clay bricks.&lt;ref&gt;Zoya Kpamma, Z. Mohammed Kamil, K. Adinkrah-Appiah, "Making Wall Construction Process Lean:The Interlocking Blocksystem as a Toole" [sic], International Conference on Infrastructural Development In Africa (ICIDA), KNUST, Kumasi, Ghana, March 2012. https://www.academia.edu/2647016/MAKING_WALL_CONSTRUCTION_PROCESS_LEAN_THE_INTERLOCKING_BLOCK_SYSTEM_AS_A_TOOL accessed 12/11/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stone or rock ===
Rock structures have existed for as long as history can recall. It is the longest lasting building material available, and is usually readily available. There are many types of rock throughout the world, all with differing attributes that make them better or worse for particular uses. Rock is a very dense material so it gives a lot of protection too; its main drawback as a material is its weight and awkwardness. Its [[energy density]] is also considered a big drawback, as stone is hard to keep warm without using large amounts of heating resources.

[[Dry-stone wall]]s have been built for as long as humans have put one stone on top of another. Eventually, different forms of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] were used to hold the stones together, cement being the most commonplace now.

The [[granite]]-strewn uplands of [[Dartmoor]] National Park, United Kingdom, for example, provided ample resources for early settlers. Circular huts were constructed from loose granite rocks throughout the [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]], and the remains of an estimated 5,000 can still be seen today. Granite continued to be used throughout the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] period (see [[Dartmoor longhouse]]) and into modern times. [[Slate]] is another stone type, commonly used as roofing material in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world where it is found.

[[Rock (geology)|Stone]] buildings can be seen in most major cities; some civilizations built entirely with stone such as the Egyptian and Aztec [[pyramids]] and the structures of the [[Inca]] civilization.

===Thatch===
[[File:Toda Hut.JPG|thumb|right|Toda tribe hut]]
[[Thatch]] is one of the oldest of building materials known, Thatch is another word for grass; grass is a good insulator and easily harvested. Many African tribes have lived in homes made completely of grasses and sand year-round. In Europe, thatch roofs on homes were once prevalent but the material fell out of favor as industrialization and improved transport increased the availability of other materials. Today, though, the practice is undergoing a revival. In the Netherlands, for instance, many new buildings have thatched roofs with special ridge tiles on top.

=== Wood and timber ===
[[File:Wood-framed house.jpg|thumb|A wood-framed house under construction in Texas, United States]]
[[File:Gliwice-radiostacja.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Gliwice Radio Tower]] (the second tallest wooden structure in the world) in [[Poland]] (2012).]]

[[Wood]] has been used as a building material for thousands of years in its natural state. Today, [[engineered wood]] is becoming very common in industrialized countries.

Wood is a product of [[tree]]s, and sometimes other [[natural fiber|fibrous]] plants, used for construction purposes when cut or pressed into lumber and timber, such as boards, planks and similar materials.  It is a  generic building material and is used in building just about any type of structure in most climates.  Wood can be very flexible under loads, keeping strength while bending, and is incredibly strong when compressed vertically. There are many differing qualities to the different types of wood, even among same tree species. This means specific species are better suited for various uses than others. And [[forest management|growing conditions]] are important for deciding quality.

"Timber" is the term used for construction purposes except the term "lumber" is used in the United States. Raw wood (a log, trunk, bole) becomes timber when the wood has been "converted" (sawn, hewn, split) in the forms of [[Log cabin|minimally-processed logs stacked on top of each other]], [[timber frame]] construction, and [[Framing (construction)|light-frame construction]].  The main problems with timber structures are [[fire risk]] and moisture-related problems.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In modern times [[softwood]] is used as a lower-value bulk material, whereas [[hardwood]] is usually used for finishings and furniture. Historically timber frame structures were built with oak in western Europe, recently [[douglas fir]] has become the most popular wood for most types of structural building.

Many families or communities, in rural areas, have a personal [[woodlot]] from which the family or community will grow and harvest trees to build with or sell. These lots are tended to like a garden. This was much more prevalent in pre-industrial times, when laws existed as to the amount of wood one could cut at any one time to ensure there would be a supply of timber for the future, but is still a viable form of  agriculture.

==Man-made substances==

===Fired bricks and clay blocks===
[[File:Stapel bakstenen - Pile of bricks 2005 Fruggo.jpg|right|thumb|A pile of fired bricks.]]
[[File:Assentamento com argamassa polimérica.JPG|thumb|Clay blocks (sometimes called clay block brick) being laid with an adhesive rather than mortar]]
[[Brick]]s are made in a similar way to mud-bricks except without the fibrous binder such as straw and are ''fired'' ("burned" in a [[brick clamp]] or [[kiln]]) after they have air-dried to permanently harden them. Kiln fired clay bricks are a [[ceramic]] material. Fired bricks can be solid or have hollow cavities to aid in drying and make them lighter and easier to transport. The individual bricks are placed upon each other in courses using [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Successive courses being used to build up walls, [[arch]]es, and other architectural elements. Fired brick walls are usually substantially thinner than cob/adobe while keeping the same vertical strength. They require more energy to create but are easier to transport and store, and are lighter than stone blocks. Romans extensively used fired brick of a shape and type now called [[Roman brick]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wienerberger.com/natural-building-with-clay/history-of-bricks] History of bricks wienerberger.com&lt;/ref&gt; Building with brick gained much popularity in the mid-18th century and 19th centuries. This was due to lower costs with increases in brick  &lt;ref name="Prime design build"&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 5 Reasons Why Bricks Are The Most Popular Building Material |url=http://www.primedb.co/top-5-reasons-bricks-popular-building-material-denver-today/ |publisher=primedb.co |date= May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; manufacturing and fire-safety in the ever crowding cities.

The [[cinder block]] supplemented or replaced fired bricks in the late 20th century often being used for the inner parts of masonry walls and by themselves.

[[Structural clay tile]]s (clay blocks) are clay or [[terracotta]] and typically are perforated with holes.

===Cement composites===
[[Cement]] bonded composites are made of hydrated cement paste that binds wood, particles, or fibers to make pre-cast building components. Various fiberous materials, including [[paper]], [[fiberglass]], and [[carbon-fiber]] have been used as binders.

Wood and natural fibers are composed of various soluble organic compounds like [[carbohydrate]]s, [[glycoside]]s and phenolics. These compounds are known to retard cement setting. Therefore, before using a wood in making cement bonded composites, its compatibility with cement is assessed.

Wood-cement compatibility is the ratio of a parameter related to the property of a wood-cement composite to that of a neat cement paste. The compatibility is often expressed as a percentage value. To determine wood-cement compatibility, methods based on different properties are used, such as, hydration characteristics, strength, interfacial bond and morphology. Various methods are used by researchers such as the measurement of hydration characteristics of a cement-aggregate mix;&lt;ref&gt;Sandermann, W. and Kohler, R. (1964) Studies on mineral-bonded wood materials. IV. A short test of the aptitudes of woods for cement-bonded materials. Holzforschung 18, 53:59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weatherwax, R.C. and Tarkow, H. (1964) Effect of wood on setting of Portland cement. For. Prod. J. 14(12), 567–570.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachmi, M., Moslemi, A.A. and Campbell, A.G. (1990) A new technique to classify the compatibility of wood with cement. Wood Sci. Technol.  24(4), 345–354.&lt;/ref&gt; the comparison of the mechanical properties of cement-aggregate mixes&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Z. and Lee, A.W.C. (1986) Compressive strength of cylindrical samples as an indicator of wood- cement compatibility. For. Prod. J.  36(11/12), 87–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirbas, A. and Aslan, A. (1998) Effects of ground hazelnut shell, wood and tea waste on the mechanical properties of cement. Cement Concrete Res. 28(8), 1101–1104.&lt;/ref&gt; and the visual assessment of microstructural properties of the wood-cement mixes.&lt;ref&gt;Ahn, W.Y. and Moslemi, A.A. (1980) SEM examination of wood-Portland cement bonds. Wood Sci .13(2), 77–82.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that the hydration test by measuring the change in hydration temperature with time is the most convenient method. Recently, Karade et al.&lt;ref&gt;Karade SR, Irle M, Maher K (2003) Assessment of wood-cement compatibility: A new approach.  Holzforschung, 57: 672–680.&lt;/ref&gt; have reviewed these methods of compatibility assessment and suggested a method based on the ‘maturity concept’ i.e. taking in consideration both time and temperature of cement hydration reaction.

Bricks were laid in [[lime mortar]] from the time of the Romans until supplanted by Portland cement [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in the early 20th century. [[Concrete masonry unit|Cement blocks]] also sometimes are filled with [[grout]] or covered with a [[parge coat]].

===Concrete===
[[File:FalkirkWheelSide 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|right|[[Falkirk Wheel]]]]
[[Concrete]] is a [[composite material|composite]] building material made from the combination of [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] and a binder such as [[cement]].  The most common form of concrete is Portland cement concrete, which consists of mineral aggregate (generally [[gravel]] and [[sand]]), [[portland cement]] and [[water (molecule)|water]].

After mixing, the cement [[Hydration reaction|hydrates]] and eventually hardens into a stone-like material. When used in the generic sense, this is the material referred to by the term "concrete".

For a concrete construction of any size, as concrete has a rather low [[tensile strength]], it is generally strengthened using steel rods or bars (known as [[rebar]]s). This strengthened concrete is then referred to as [[reinforced concrete]]. In order to minimise any air bubbles, that would weaken the structure, a vibrator is used to eliminate any air that has been entrained when the liquid concrete mix is poured around the ironwork. Concrete has been the predominant building material in the modern age due to its longevity, formability, and ease of transport. Recent advancements, such as [[insulating concrete form]]s, combine the concrete forming and other construction steps (installation of insulation). All materials must be taken in required proportions as described in standards.

===Fabric===
The tent is the home of choice among nomadic groups all over the world. Two well-known types include the conical [[teepee]] and the circular [[yurt]]. The tent has been revived as a major construction technique with the development of [[tensile architecture]] and synthetic fabrics. Modern buildings can be made of flexible material such as [[Textile|fabric]] membranes, and supported by a system of steel cables, rigid or internal, or by air pressure.

===Foam===
[[File:Celotex thermax foamed plastic sheets.jpg|thumb|right|Foamed plastic sheet to be used as backing for [[Mortar (firestop)|firestop mortar]] at CIBC bank in [[Toronto]].]]
Recently, synthetic [[polystyrene]] or [[polyurethane]] foam has been used in combination with structural materials, such as concrete. It is lightweight, easily shaped, and an excellent insulator. Foam is usually used as part of a [[structural insulated panel]], wherein the foam is sandwiched between wood or cement or insulating concrete forms.

===Glass===
[[Glassmaking]] is considered an art form as well as an industrial process or material.

Clear windows have been used since the invention of glass to cover small openings in a building. Glass panes provided humans with the ability to both let light into rooms while at the same time keeping inclement weather outside.

Glass is generally made from mixtures of sand and [[silicate]]s, in a very hot fire stove called a [[kiln]], and is very brittle. Additives are often included the mixture used to produce glass with shades of colors or various characteristics (such as [[bulletproof glass]] or lightbulbs.

The use of glass in architectural buildings has become very popular in the modern culture. Glass "[[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]]" can be used to cover the entire facade of a building, or it can be used to span over a wide roof structure in a "[[space frame]]". These uses though require some sort of frame to hold sections of glass together, as glass by itself is too brittle and would require an overly large kiln to be used to span such large areas by itself.

[[Glass brick]]s were invented in the early 20th century.

===Gypcrete===
Gypcrete is a mixture of [[gypsum]] plaster and fibreglass [[roving]]s. Although plaster and fibres [[fiborous plaster]] have been used for many years, especially for ceilings, it was not until the early 1990s that serious studies of the strength and qualities of a walling system [[Rapidwall]], using a mixture of gypsum plaster and 300mm plus fibreglass rovings, were investigated. It was discovered, through testing at the [[University of Adelaide]], that these walls had significant, [[load bearing wall|load bearing]], shear and lateral resistance together with earthquake-resistance, fire-resistance, and thermal properties.  With an abundance of gypsum (naturally occurring and by-product chemical FGD and phospho gypsums) available worldwide, gypcrete-based building products, which are fully recyclable, offer significant environmental benefits.

=== Metal ===
[[Metal]] is used as structural framework for larger buildings such as [[skyscraper]]s, or as an external surface covering. There are many types of [[Architectural metals|metals]] used for building. Metal figures quite prominently in [[prefabricated]] structures such as the [[Quonset hut]], and can be seen used in most cosmopolitan cities. It requires a great deal of human labor to produce metal, especially in the large amounts needed for the building industries.
[[Corrosion]] is metal's prime enemy when it comes to longevity.
* [[Steel]] is a metal [[alloy]] whose major component is [[iron]], and is the usual choice for metal structural building materials. It is strong, flexible, and if refined well and/or [[Corrosion prevention|treated]] lasts a long time.
* The lower [[density]] and better [[corrosion]] resistance of [[aluminium]] alloys and [[tin]] sometimes overcome their greater [[cost]].

[[File:20130816 Belfry of St Laurentius Ahrweiler.jpg|thumb|Copper belfry of St. Laurentius church, [[Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler]] ]]
* [[Copper]] is a valued building material because of its advantageous properties (see: [[Copper in architecture]]). These include corrosion resistance, durability, low thermal movement, light weight, radio frequency shielding, lightning protection, sustainability, recyclability, and a wide range of finishes. Copper is incorporated into roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, wall cladding, building expansion joints, and indoor design elements.
* Other metals used include [[Chrome plating|chrome]], [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[titanium]]. Titanium can be used for structural purposes, but it is much more expensive than steel. Chrome, gold, and silver are used as decoration, because these materials are expensive and lack structural qualities such as tensile strength or hardness.

===Plastics===
[[File:Piping floor penetrations nortown casitas.jpg|thumb|left|Plastic [[pipe (material)|pipes]] penetrating a [[concrete]] floor in a Canadian highrise apartment building]]
The term "plastics" covers a range of synthetic or semi-synthetic [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[condensation reaction|condensation]] or [[polymerization]] products that can be molded or extruded into objects, films, or [[synthetic fiber|fibers]]. Their name is derived from the fact that in their semi-liquid state they are malleable, or have the property of [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]. Plastics vary immensely in heat tolerance, hardness, and resiliency. Combined with this adaptability, the general uniformity of composition and lightness of plastics ensures their use in almost all industrial applications today. [[High performance plastics]] such as ETFE have become an ideal building material due to its high abrasion resistance and chemical inertness. Notable buildings that feature it include: the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] and the [[Eden Project]] biomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fluorotherm.com/the-advantages-of-etfe-fluoropolymer-tubing/|title = The Advantages of ETFE Fluoropolymer Tubing|date = April 1, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Fluorotherm|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papers and membranes===
Building papers and membranes are used for many reasons in construction. One of the oldest building papers is [[red rosin paper]] which was known to be in use before 1850 and was used as an underlayment in exterior walls, roofs, and floors and for protecting a jobsite during construction. [[Tar paper]] was invented late in the 19th century and was used for similar purposes as rosin paper and for [[built-up roof|gravel roofs]]. Tar paper has largely fallen out of use supplanted by asphalt [[felt paper]]. Felt paper has been supplanted in some uses by synthetic underlayments, particularly in roofing by synthetic underlayments and siding by [[housewrap]]s.

There are a wide variety of [[damp proofing]] and [[waterproofing]] membranes used for roofing, [[basement waterproofing]], and [[geomembrane]]s.

===Ceramics===
Fired clay [[brick]]s have been used since the time of the Romans. Special [[tile]]s are used for roofing, siding, flooring, ceilings,  pipes, flue liners, and more.

==Building products==
In the [[market place]] the term "building products" often refers to ready-made particles/sections, made from various materials, that are fitted in architectural hardware and decorative hardware parts of a building. The list of building products excludes the building materials used to construct the building architecture and supporting fixtures, like windows, doors, cabinets, etc. Building products, rather, support and make building materials work in a [[modular]] fashion.

"Building products" may also refer to items used to put such hardware together, such as [[caulking]], [[glue]]s, paint, and anything else bought for the purpose of constructing a building.

==Testing and certification==

* [[UL (safety organization)]]
* [[ETL SEMKO]] — Building Product Testing Laboratory in the USA, part of Intertek, based in London
* [[NTA Inc]]{{mdash}} Building Product Certification Agency based in Nappanee, Indiana, USA

==History==
{{History of the Arab States}}
Characene was founded around 127 BC under Aspasine, known in classical writings as [[Hyspaosines]], a former [[satrap]] installed by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]]. Characene remained intact throughout the [[Seleucid Empire]] and continued as an essentially independent kingdom under the Parthians until it was conquered by the [[Sassanian]]s at the beginning of the third century AD.

After the Parthian conquest, Characene remained a semi-autonomous country with its own kings. Its tenure as a separate kingdom ended with the fall of the Parthian Empire.

The kings of Characene are known mainly by their coins, consisting mainly of silver [[tetradrachm]]s with [[Greek language|Greek]] and later [[Aramaic]] inscriptions. These coins are dated after the [[Seleucid era]], providing a secure framework for chronological succession.

Charax, the capital of Characene, was founded by [[Alexander the Great]]. The city was constructed on an artificial mound to protect the site from the floodwaters of the nearby rivers. The new town served as a major commercial port for the eastern capital of [[Babylon]]. Charax flourished under the Seleucid Empire, controlling the trade in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. It was also a center for pearl diving.
[[File:Charax (Peutinger Map).png|thumb|The town of Charax Spa. on the 4th century Peutinger map]]
The Roman emperor [[Trajan]] visited Charax in 116 AD during his invasion of Parthia, where he saw ships bound for India.

After it was destroyed by a flood, Charax was rebuilt by Seleucid king [[Antiochus III the Great]] (222–187 BC) and was briefly called Antiochia. After the Parthian invasion of Mesopotamia in 141 BC, Charax became independent.

The state kept its independence (perhaps as a vassal of the Parthian Empire) and sometimes joined the Romans in their struggle against the common enemy, the Parthian king. In his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], [[Pliny the Elder]] praises the port of Charax:

:The embankments extend in length a distance of nearly 4½ kilometers, in breadth a little less. It stood at first at a distance of 1¾ km from the shore, and even had a harbor of its own. But according to Juba, it is 75 kilometer from the sea; and at the present day, the ambassadors from Arabia, and our own merchants who have visited the place, say that it stands at a distance of one 180 kilometers from the sea-shore. Indeed, in no part of the world have alluvial deposits been formed more rapidly by the rivers, and to a greater extent than here; and it is only a matter of surprise that the tides, which run to a considerable distance beyond this city, do not carry them back again.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder (AD 77). ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''. Book VI. xxxi. 138-140. Translation by W. H. S. Jones, [[Loeb Classical Library]], London/Cambridge, Massachusetts (1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade continued to be important. A famous Characenian, a man named [[Isidore of Charax|Isidore]], was the author of a treatise on Parthian trade routes, the ''Mansiones Parthicae''. The inhabitants of [[Palmyra]] had a permanent trading station in Characene. Many inscriptions mention caravan trade.

In 221-22 AD, an ethnic Persian, [[Ardashir I|Ardašēr]], who was [[satrap]] of [[Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Fars]], led a revolt against the Parthians, establishing the [[Sassanid Empire]]. According to later Arab histories, he defeated Characene forces, killed its last ruler, rebuilt the town, and renamed it Astarābād-Ardašīr''.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]], Ṭabarī I&lt;/ref&gt; The area around Charax that had been the Characene state was thereon known by the [[Aramaic]]/Syriac name Maysān, which was later adapted by the Arab conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;Yāqūt, [[Kitab mu'jam al-buldan]] IV and III&lt;/ref&gt;

Charax continued, under the name Maysān, with Persian texts making various mention of governors throughout the fifth century. A [[Nestorian Church]] was mentioned there in the sixth century. The Charax [[mint (coin)|mint]] appears to have continued throughout the Sassanid empire and into the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad empire]], minting coins as late as AD 715.&lt;ref&gt;Characene and Charax,  [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/characene-and-charax-spasinou-in-pre-islamic-times Characene and Charax] Encyclopaedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest references from the first century A.D. indicates that the people of Characene were referred to as Μεσηνός and lived along the Arabian side of the coast at the head of the Persian Gulf.

'''Coma Pedrosa''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈkomə pəˈðɾozə}}; {{convert|2943|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is the highest mountain in the principality of [[Andorra]].&lt;ref name="Simonis2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simonis|first=Damien |title=Catalunya &amp; the Costa Brava|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpnA4A1qc4MC&amp;pg=PA247|accessdate=23 December 2010|date=October 2003|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-381-6|pages=247–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is popular with mountain climbers, its ascent being technically straightforward, although strenuous. From Arinsal to Camp de Refuge (650m climb) is being considered moderate meanwhile the last 862m is considered to be difficult. Several mountain lakes and [[tarn (lake)|tarns]] are found on the slopes, notably [[Estanys de Baiau]], which lies on the western slopes, across the [[Spain|Spanish]] border.

The nearest town is [[Arinsal]], [[La Massana]]. Historically, the mountain provided ample security from invasions into Andorra.&lt;ref name="Augustin2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustin|first=Byron|title=Andorra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4MNjT4QS0EC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=22 December 2010|date=January 2009|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-3122-0|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In present day, the mountain is part of the [[Parc Natural Comunal de les Valls del Comapedrosa]] national park.

It has in the past acted as a barrier between Andorra and France. The mountainous terrain of Andorra, a landlocked country, contains 65 peaks that rise to an elevation of greater than {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and of the 65 peaks, Coma Pedrosa has the highest one at {{convert|2943|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Augustin" /&gt;

Its recent exposure to tourism has attracted millions to enjoy the unique scenic beauty of its hills and valleys.&lt;ref name= Augustin&gt;{{Cite book|last= Augustin |first=Byron |title= Andorra|page= 8|accessdate=December 22, 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4MNjT4QS0EC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Coma+Pedrosa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6dsETeTbGY_prQf1lNGRDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Coma%20Pedrosa&amp;f=false|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher reaches of the mountain are covered with forests while the lower reaches have some arable lands. The mountain gets fully covered with snow during the winter months which provides opportunities for skiing and mountaineering, ice climbing and scrambling. During the summer season, the mountain provides many easy routes for trekking through the Arinsal valley covering neighbouring areas of [[Vall Ferrera]] in [[Spain]] after crossing [[Baiau]], the mountain pass.&lt;ref name="Eur2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eur|title=Western Europe 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9QYndAPmuQC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=22 March 2010|date=13 December 2002|publisher=Europa|isbn=978-1-85743-152-0|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forest&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/coma-pedrosa/195485|title=Coma Pedrosa|accessdate=December 22, 2010|publisher=Summitpost.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Arinsal is in the narrow valley below the mountain. The Coma Pedrosa's [[Estany Negre]], the Torta Coma, Coma's Gaspedrosa, the Puestode las Erolas, Cape dels Croes, and Puig dels Emborts in the Sierra del Aguiro surround the parish of La Massana.&lt;ref name="Bladé1875"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bladé|first=Jean-François |title=Études géographiques sur la vallée d'Andorre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vaoFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=22 December 2010|year=1875|publisher=J. Baer et cie|language=French|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local area is known as Comapedrosa. The mountain is in a natural park called [[Parque Natural Comunal de los Valles del Comapedrosa]] (Communal natural park of the Comapedrosa valleys).{{cn|date=October 2016}}

===Vegetation===
The forest vegetation in the mountain and its valleys are of pines, birch and firs. There are many glacier lakes formed within the valley created by the mountains and also vast meadows. Consequent to the popularity of skiing in and around this mountain valley near Arinsal and close to the Andorra la Vella and other valleys in Andorra, the pristine ambiance of the valley has been inundated with tourist resorts, hotels, restaurants and business establishments catering to tourists. This has created an awareness to preserve virgin mountains and forests, and put restrictions on further proliferation of ski resorts and urban activities by introducing a national network of parks as preserves.&lt;ref name=forest/&gt;

The trek or the mountain climb starts from Arinsal, which is considered an easy route, from the picnic area at the base of the Ribal Warefall at {{convert|1580|m}}. It takes about 4 to 4{{fraction|1|2}} hours to reach the highest point of Pic de Coma Pedrosa. The first part of the climb, taking just under half an hour, is along a wide, {{convert|800|m}} long foot track through a sign post to [[Aigues Juntes]], which is the confluence of the Coma Pedrosa River and Pla de l'Estany River rising from the mountains and arriving at Grau. The ascent continues along a steep hill slope of the Coma Pedrosa River valley and arrives at the Coma Pedrosa refuge or camping site at an elevation {{convert|2272|m}}, which is located near the l'Estany de les Truites (Trout Lake). A further hour's walk leads to the Estany Negre (Black Lake), named on account of its colour. The last stretch is for about one hour from Estany Negre to the highest peak in Andorra at {{convert|2943|m}} elevation, and this trek, passing through rocky terrain, is difficult. The return trek follows the same route. A diversion through Malhiverns pass instead of Estany Negre is more enjoyable.&lt;ref name="RobertsonMeadowcroft2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alf Robertson|author2=Jane Meadowcroft|title=The Mountains Of Andorra: Walks, Scrambles, Via Ferratas, Treks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJMAXkr_ogMC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=22 December 2010|date=November 2005|publisher=Cicerone Press Limited|isbn=978-1-85284-424-0|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kev Reynolds|title=Walks and Climbs in the Pyrenees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e123YCdPgOkC&amp;pg=PA398|accessdate=22 December 2010|date=October 2007|publisher=Cicerone Press Limited|isbn=978-1-85284-470-7|pages=398–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trek&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hola-andorra.com/arinsal/english/comapedrosagb.html|title=The "Coma Pedrosa" 2942 m:Tackle the highest mountain in Andorra|accessdate=December 22, 2010|publisher=Hola-andorra.com|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121204184102/http://www.hola-andorra.com/arinsal/english/comapedrosagb.html|archive-date=2012-12-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denmark Sound''' or '''Denmark Fjord''' ({{Lang-da|Danmark fjord}}) is a [[fjord]] or [[Sound (geography)|sound]] located on the northeast tip of [[Greenland]] within [[Northeast Greenland National Park]].

The fjord was found and named during the ill-fated [[Denmark expedition]] 1906-1908 led by [[Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen]] which mapped Greenland's north coast between [[Cape York (Greenland)|Cape York]] and Denmark Sound.&lt;ref&gt;John McCannon, ''A History of the Arctic: Nature, Exploration and Exploitation,'' p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
This fjord, together with [[Independence Sound]] and [[Hagen Sound]], flows into the [[Wandel Sea]], which is part of the [[Arctic Ocean]].
Three islands are located in the bay at the mouth of the sound, [[Princess Thyra Island]], [[Princess Margaret Island]] and [[Princess Dagmar Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapcarta.com/19187700 Prinsesse Thyra Ø]&lt;/ref&gt; The area was formerly part of [[Avannaa]], originally Nordgrønland ("North Greenland"), a former county of Greenland until 31 December 2008.

The [[Denmark|Danish]] [[military base]]/[[weather station]] [[Nord, Greenland| Nord]] is located by the sound on the western side of [[Crown Prince Christian Land]] Peninsula.

'''Devín Gate''' or '''Hainburger Gate''' ({{lang-sk|Devínska brána}}, {{IPA-sk|ˈɟɛʋiːnska ˈbraːna|pron}}; {{lang-de|Hainburger Pforte}}) is a natural gate in the [[Danube]] valley at the border of [[Slovakia]] and [[Austria]]. It is one out of four [[geomorphological]] areas of the [[Devín Carpathians]], part of the [[Little Carpathians]] mountain range. [[Passau]], Devín Gate, and the [[Iron Gates]] divide the Danube river into four distinct sections.

Devín Gate has been inhabited since prehistoric times, with continuous settlement since 5000 BC. It was a strategic part of the ancient [[Amber Road]] connecting [[Northern Europe]] with the [[Mediterranean]] and during the [[Middle Ages]], five [[castle]]s have been built here, Heimenburg Castle, Rothelstein Castle, Pottenburg Castle, [[Devín Castle]], and [[Bratislava Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vyhliadková plavba: Tri hrady v Devínskej bráne|url=http://www.panorama.sk/sk/sprievodca/vyhliadkova-plavba-devinska-brana/2218|publisher=panorama.sk|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was continually guarded since the Roman times and it has served as a border of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Iron Curtain]] during the [[Cold War]] and finally a border between Austria and [[Czechoslovakia]], today Slovakia. On 1 May 2004 Slovakia entered the [[Schengen Zone]], allowing free movement of persons for the first time in history.

== Name ==
Formerly, the gate was called in {{lang-la|Porta Hungarica}} and in {{lang-hu|Dévényi kapu}}.

== Location and description ==
In a wider sense it begins below [[Bratislava Castle]] (in which case the gate is 11.5&amp;nbsp;km long and 2 to 7&amp;nbsp;km wide) and in a narrower sense it begins below [[Devín Castle]]. It ends near [[Hundsheimer Berg]], the highest peak of the [[Hundsheimer Berge|Austrian Carpathians]] at 480 meters [[AMSL]], in Austria on the right bank of the Danube. To the east, it borders another natural gate, the [[Lamač Gate]].

Geologically, Devín Gate was created during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch. A large part of its core consists of [[granite]] massifs from the [[Carboniferous]] period. It also features [[limestone]]s and [[dolomite]]s from the [[Cenozoic]] era. [[Neogene]] period sediments include [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], [[gravel]]s and others. On the Upper Danube, comprising the section between the springs where the river begins and Devín Gate upstream of Bratislava, the extension of the morphological floodplain is smaller as compared to the rest of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Dister and Dopke, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the Venetian cartographer}}
[[File:Frater Maurus S. Michaelis Moranensis de Venetiis ordinis Camaldulensis.png|thumb|344px|A medal in honor of Fra Mauro, "an incomparable cosmographer", produced soon after his death, probably by the artist Giovanni Boldù]] &lt;!-- File poorly scales; better keep the original size, 344 px--&gt;
[[Fra]] '''Mauro''', [[Camaldolese|O.S.B. Cam.]], (died 1464) was an [[Italians|Italian]] cartographer who lived in the [[Republic of Venice]]. He created the most detailed and accurate map of the world up until that time, the [[Fra Mauro map]].

Mauro was a [[monk]] of the [[Camaldolese]] [[Monastery of St. Michael (Murano)|Monastery of St. Michael]], located on the island of [[Murano]] in the [[Venetian Lagoon]]. It was there that he maintained a cartography workshop. He also was employed by some very powerful men like Prince [[Prince Henry the Navigator|Henry the Navigator]].

== Biography ==
Fra Mauro was born before or around the year 1400. In his youth, Mauro had traveled extensively as a merchant and a soldier. He was familiar with the Middle East. He is recorded in the records of the Monastery of St. Michael from 1409. As a [[laity|lay member]] of the monastery, Mauro was employed as [[Cartography|mapmaker]]. In the records of the monastery his main job was recorded as collecting the monastery's rents, but from the 1450s he is also mentioned as the creator of a series of world maps. Although he was no longer free to travel, due to his religious status, he would frequently consult with merchants of the city upon their return from overseas voyages. By 1450 he composed a great ''mappa mundi'' - a world map - with surprising accuracy, including extensive written comments reflecting the geographic knowledge of his time. The map is known today as the "[[Fra Mauro map]]".

==The Fra Mauro world map==
[[Image:FraMauroMap.jpg|thumb|300px|The 1450 ca. [[Fra Mauro map]] (inverted, South is normally at the top). The map is a world map that depicts Asia, Africa and Europe.]]{{Main|Fra Mauro map}}

The Fra Mauro world map, or [[mappa mundi]], was a major cartographical work that compiled much of the geographical knowledge of the time. The map covers over five square meters. The map is extremely detailed and contains many thousands of texts and illustrations. The world map took several years to complete and was the most detailed and accurate world map that had been produced up until that time.

Fra Mauro created the map under a commission by King [[Afonso V of Portugal]]. [[Bianco world map|Andrea Bianco]], a sailor-cartographer, is recorded as having collaborated with Fra Mauro in creating the map, as payments made to him between 1448 and 1459 testify. The map was completed on 24 April 1459, and sent to [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], but that copy didn't survive. Along with the map was a letter from the [[Doge of Venice]]. It was intended for [[Prince Henry the Navigator]], Afonso V's uncle. It encouraged the prince to continue funding exploratory journeys. Fra Mauro died the following year, while he was making a copy of the map for the [[Signoria]] of Venice. The copy was completed by Andrea Bianco. A commemorative medal of the period struck in honor of his cartographic work describes Fra Mauro as "chosmographus incomparabilis".

==Other works==
Two copies of maps by Fra Mauro are known to survive. One is a [[portolan chart]] in the [[Vatican Library]], ([[Borgia|Codice Borgiano V]]) published by Roberto Almagià in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Almagià, discussing the copy of another map by Fra Mauro, in the [[Vatican Library]]: Roberto Almagià, ''Monumenta cartographica vaticana'', (Rome 1944) I:32–40; Heinrich Winter, "The Fra Mauro Portolan Chart in the Vatican" ''Imago Mundi'' '''16''' (1962), pp. 17–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The other was recognized by Antonio Ratti as a copy signed by [[Giorgio Sideri|Giorgio Callapoda]] at [[Heraklion|Candia]] and dated 1541, of a lost chart by Fra Mauro, sold at auction in Milan in 1984&lt;ref&gt;Galleria Salomon Agustoni Agrati, 24 October 1984, 40,000,000 lire&lt;/ref&gt; and now in a private collection, probably in France.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Ratti, " A Lost Map of Fra Mauro Found in a Sixteenth Century Copy" ''Imago Mundi'' '''40''' (1988), pp. 77–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes==
The crater [[Fra Mauro (crater)|Fra Mauro]] and associated [[Fra Mauro formation]] of the [[Moon]] are named after him. The [[Apollo 13]] lunar mission was intended to explore the Fra Mauro formation, but – due to the [[Apollo_13#Oxygen_tank_rupture|explosion aboard the spacecraft]] – Apollo 13's crew had to return to Earth without landing on the Moon. The formation was instead explored by [[astronaut]]s [[Alan Shepard]] and [[Edgar Mitchell]] of the [[Apollo 14]] mission in February 1971.

'''Hwanghae''' (''Hwanghae-do'' {{IPA-ko|hwaŋ.ɦɛ.do|}}) was one of the [[Eight Provinces of Korea]] during the [[Joseon]]. Hwanghae was located in the northwest of Korea. The provincial capital was [[Haeju]]. 
The [[Regions of Korea|regional name]] for the province was Haeseo.

==History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Provinces of Korea]] --&gt;
In 1395, the province was organized as P'unghae (''P'unghae-do;'' 풍해도; 豊海道).  In 1417, the province was renamed Hwanghae.  The name derived from the names of the two principal cities of Hwangju (황주; 黃州) and Haeju (해주; 海州).

In 1895, the province was reorganized into the [[Provinces of Korea#Districts of Late Joseon|Districts]] of Haeju (''Haeju-bu;'' 해주부; 海州府) in the west and [[Kaesong|Gaeseong]] (''Gaeseong-bu;'' 개성부; 開城府) in the east, but in 1896, a new system of thirteen provinces was established, and Hwanghae Province was reconstituted.

In 1945, Korea was [[Division of Korea|divided]] into [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[United States|American]] zones of occupation, north and south respectively of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]].  The southernmost part of Hwanghae (around the towns of [[Ongjin County, South Hwanghae|Ongjin]] and [[Yonan County]]) was cut off from the rest of the province by the dividing line and joined [[Gyeonggi Province]] in the southern half of the country.  In 1948, Hwanghae and Gyeonggi Provinces became parts of the new countries of [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] respectively.

In 1953, at the end of the [[Korean War]], the [[Northern Limit Line]] was established, which marked the [[maritime boundary]] between North and South Korea.  The line runs between the mainland portion of Gyeonggi Province that had been part of Hwanghae before 1945, and the adjacent offshore islands (the largest of which is [[Baengnyeongdo]]).  As a result, the mainland portion reverted to North Korean control, while the islands remained a part of South Korea.  (Since 1999, North Korea has claimed a more southerly [[Military Demarcation Line|Maritime Military Demarcation Line]], which would make the islands a part of North Korea as well.  Disputes between North and South Korean naval vessels often occur in this area.)

In 1954, North Korea's Hwanghae Province was divided into [[North Hwanghae Province|North]] and [[South Hwanghae Province]]s.

==Geography==
Hwanghae was bounded by [[Pyongan Province|Pyeongan Province]] (after 1896 [[South Pyongan Province|South Pyeongan]]) on the north, [[Gangwon Province (historical)|Gangwon Province]] on the east, [[Gyeonggi Province]] on the south, and the [[Yellow Sea]] on the west.

[[File:Ifni txu-oclc-6949452-nh29-10.jpg|thumb|Map sheet showing boundary of the former Ifni Province.]]

'''Ifni''' was a Spanish province on the Atlantic coast of [[Morocco]], south of [[Agadir]] and across from the [[Canary Islands]].

It had a total area of 1,502&amp;nbsp;km² (580 sq mi), and a population of 51,517 in 1964. The main industry was fishing.

==History==
Spain's presence in the area can be traced to a settlement called [[Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña]], founded in 1476. After attacks by the [[Berber people|Berbers]], the Spanish decided to focus on colonising other areas of [[North Africa]] and abandoned the region.

In the mid-19th century, when the European powers looked again to Africa for resources, Spain suddenly mooted an interest in its lost [[late medieval]] fortress in order to stake a claim to the southern part of Morocco. This served as a pretext for [[Spanish-Moroccan War (1859)|a short war]] with Morocco in 1859.

The territory and its main town of [[Sidi Ifni]] were ceded to Spain by the [[Sultanate of Morocco]] on 26 April 1860, but there was little interest in this colonial acquisition until 1934, when the  [[Governor-General]] of [[Spanish Sahara]] took up residence.

Until 1952, Ifni region had the status of a protectorate. In this year, the region became part of [[Spanish West Africa]] (entity that grouped the colonies of Spanish Sahara and Cape Juby).

After the [[Ifni War]] (1957), most of the territory became occupied de facto by Morocco.
In 1958, the colony was made into a Spanish province in order to forestall [[United Nations]] criticism of continued colonisation.

Spain formally returned the territory to Morocco on 30 June 1969.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Yearbook 1969, pp. 661-64.&lt;/ref&gt;  The territory was integrated into the Moroccan region of [[Souss-Massa-Drâa]].

== Postage stamps ==

Spain began issuing [[postage stamp]]s for Ifni in 1941, initially [[overprint]]ing Spanish stamps with "TERRITORIO DE IFNI", then issuing new designs in 1943. Issues followed at the rate of about ten per year with the last on 23 November 1968.  Most are commonly available and are more often seen unused than used.

==Naming==
The lineage of the name begins with the JASO1 meeting (JASO = Journées Altimétriques Satellitaires pour l'Océanographie) in Toulouse, France to study the problems of assimilating altimeter data in models. Jason as an acronym also stands for "Joint Altimetry Satellite Oceanography Network". Additionally it is used to reference the mythical quest for knowledge of Jason and the Argonauts.[http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/multimedia/publications-and-links/newsletter/newsletter05/a-new-voyage-for-jason.html][http://www.wmo-sat.info/oscar/satelliteprogrammes/view/85][https://science.nasa.gov/about-us/smd-programs/joint-agency-satellite-division]

==History==
Jason-1 is the successor to the [[TOPEX/Poseidon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topex-www.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/topex.html |title=Ocean Surface Topography from Space |publisher=NASA/JPL |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531084646/http://topex-www.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/topex.html |archivedate=2008-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; mission, which measured [[ocean surface topography]] from 1992 through 2005. Like its predecessor, Jason-1 is a joint project between the [[NASA]] ([[United States]]) and [[CNES]] ([[France]]) space agencies. Jason-1's successor, the [[Ocean Surface Topography Mission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/ostm.html | title = Ocean Surface Topography from Space | publisher = NASA/JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the '''[[Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason-2|Jason-2]]''' satellite, was launched in June 2008. These satellites provide a unique global view of the oceans that is impossible to acquire using traditional ship-based sampling.

Jason-1 was built by [[Thales Alenia Space]] using a [[Proteus (satellite)|Proteus]] platform, under a contract from CNES, as well as the main Jason-1 instrument, the Poseidon-2 altimeter (successor to the Poseidon altimeter on-board TOPEX/Poseidon)

Jason-1 was designed to measure [[climate change]] through very precise millimeter-per-year measurements of global [[sea level change]]s. As did TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 uses an [[altimeter]] to measure the hills and valleys of the ocean's surface. These measurements of [[Ocean surface topography|sea surface topography]] allow scientists to calculate the speed and direction of ocean currents and monitor global ocean circulation. The global ocean is Earth's primary storehouse of solar energy. Jason-1's measurements of sea surface height reveal where this heat is stored, how it moves around Earth by ocean currents, and how these processes affect weather and climate.

Jason-1 was launched on December 7, 2001 from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a [[Delta II]] [[Launch vehicle|rocket]]. During the first months Jason-1 shared an almost identical orbit to TOPEX/Poseidon, which allowed for cross calibration. At the end of this period, the older satellite was moved to a new orbit midway between each Jason [[ground track]]. Jason had a repeat cycle of 10 days.

On 16 March 2002, Jason-1 experienced a sudden attitude upset, accompanied by temporary fluctuations in the onboard electrical systems.  Soon after this incident, two new small pieces of [[space debris]] were observed in orbits slightly lower than Jason-1's, and [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic analysis]] eventually proved them to have originated from Jason-1.  In 2011, it was determined that the pieces of debris had most likely been ejected from Jason-1 by an unidentified, small "high-speed particle" hitting one of the spacecraft's solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/newsletter/pdfs/ODQNv15i3.pdf|title=New Evidence of Particle Impact on Jason-1 Spacecraft|date=July 2011|format=PDF|access-date=2 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020092342/http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/newsletter/pdfs/ODQNv15i3.pdf|archive-date=20 October 2011|publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbit maneuvers in 2009 put the Jason-1 satellite on the opposite side of Earth from the [[Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason-2|Jason-2]] satellite, which is operated by the U.S. and French weather agencies. At that time, Jason-1 flew over the same region of the ocean that [[Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason-2|Jason-2]] flew over five days earlier. Its ground tracks fell midway between those of [[Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason-2|Jason-2]], which are about {{convert|315|km|mi|sp=us}} apart at the equator.

This interleaved tandem mission provided twice the number of measurements of the ocean's surface, bringing smaller features such as ocean eddies into view. The tandem mission also helped pave the way for a future ocean altimeter mission that would collect much more detailed data with its single instrument than the two Jason satellites now do together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/features/200904-1.html |title=Tandem Mission Brings Ocean Currents Into Sharper Focus |publisher=NASA/JPL |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422221414/http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/features/200904-1.html |archivedate=2009-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2012, having helped cross-calibrate the [[Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason-2|Jason-2]] replacement mission, Jason-1 was maneuvered into its graveyard orbit and all remaining fuel was vented.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/07/last-transmitter-dies-finalizing-retirement-for-ocean-sensing-satellite/ "Last transmitter dies, finalizing retirement for ocean-sensing satellite."] ''Ars Technica.'' Retrieved: 25 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission was still able to return science data, measuring Earth's gravity field over the ocean. On 21 June 2013, contact with Jason-1 was lost; multiple attempts to re-establish communication failed. It was determined that the last remaining transmitter on board the spacecraft had failed. Operators sent commands to the satellite to turn off remaining functioning components on 1 July 2013, rendering it decommissioned. It is estimated that the spacecraft will remain on orbit for at least 1,000 years. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-213 "Long-Running Jason-1 Ocean Satellite Takes Final Bow."] ''Jet Propulsion Laboratory.'' Retrieved: 25 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is named after the [[Greece|Greek]] mythological hero [[Jason]].

==Satellite instruments==

Jason-1 has five 5 instruments:
* Poseidon 2 – [[Nadir]] pointing [[Radar altimeter]] using [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and {{Ku band}} for measuring height above [[sea]] surface.
* Jason [[Microwave]] [[Radiometer]] (JMR) –  measures [[water vapor]] along altimeter path to correct for pulse delay
* [[DORIS (geodesy)|DORIS]] ([[Doppler Effect|Doppler]] Orbitography  and Radiopositioning Integrated by [[Satellite]]) for orbit determination to within 10&amp;nbsp;cm or less and [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] correction data for Poseidon 2.
* BlackJack [[Global Positioning System]] receiver provides precise [[orbit]] [[ephemeris]] data
* Laser [[retroreflector]] array works with ground stations to track the satellite and calibrate and verify altimeter measurements.

The Jason-1 satellite, its altimeter instrument and a position-tracking antenna were built in France. The radiometer, Global Positioning System receiver and laser retroreflector array were built in the United States.

==Use of information==

[[TOPEX/Poseidon]] and Jason-1 have led to major advances in the science of [[physical oceanography]] and in climate studies.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.eumetsat.int/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=PDF_JASON2_SCIENCE_OP_REQ&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased |title=OSTM/JASON-2 SCIENCE AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS |publisher=EUMETSAT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020851/http://www.eumetsat.int/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=PDF_JASON2_SCIENCE_OP_REQ&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their 15-year data record of ocean surface topography has provided the first opportunity to observe and understand the global change of ocean circulation and sea level. The results have improved the understanding of the role of the ocean in climate change and improved weather and climate predictions. Data from these missions are used to improve ocean models, forecast hurricane intensity, and identify and track large ocean/atmosphere phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña. The data are also used every day in applications as diverse as routing ships, improving the safety and efficiency of offshore industry operations, managing fisheries, and tracking marine mammals.

TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 have made major contributions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/jason-2.pdf | title = "The Legacy of Topex/Poseidon and Jason 1", page 30.  Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason 2 Launch Press Kit,  June 2008 | publisher = NASA/JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the understanding of:

===Ocean Variability===

The missions revealed the surprising variability of the ocean, how much it changes from season to season, year to year, decade to decade and on even longer time scales. They ended the traditional notion of a quasi-steady, large-scale pattern of global ocean circulation by proving that the ocean is changing rapidly on all scales, from huge features such as El Niño and La Niña, which can cover the entire equatorial Pacific, to tiny eddies swirling off the large Gulf Stream in the Atlantic.

[[Image:Sealevel chart.jpg||300px|right|thumb|Although the 1993–2005 [[TOPEX|Topex/Poseidon]] satellite (on the left) measured an average annual Global Mean Sea Level rise of 3.1 mm/year, Jason-1 is measuring only 2.3 mm/year GMSL rise, and the [[Envisat]] satellite (2002–2012) is measuring just 0.5 mm/year GMSL rise. In this graph, the vertical scale represents globally averaged mean sea level. Seasonal variations in sea level have been removed to show the underlying trend. Image credit: University of Colorado]]

===Sea level change===
{{further|Sea level change}}
Measurements by Jason-1 indicate that mean sea level has been rising at an average rate of 2.28 millimeters (.09&amp;nbsp;inches) per year since 2001.  This is somewhat less than the rate measured by the earlier [[TOPEX|TOPEX/Poseidon]] mission, but over four times the rate measured by the later [[Envisat]] mission. Mean sea level measurements from Jason-1 are continuously graphed at the [http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/en/news/ocean-indicators/mean-sea-level/products-images/index.html Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales] web site, on the [http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/fileadmin/images/news/indic/msl/MSL_Serie_J1_Global_IB_RWT_NoGIA_Adjust.png Aviso page].  A composite sea level graph, using data from several satellites, is also available on [http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/msl/ that site].

The data record from these altimetry missions has given scientists important insights into how global sea level is affected by natural climate variability, as well as by human activities.

===Planetary Waves===

TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 made clear the importance of planetary-scale waves, such as [[Rossby wave|Rossby]] and [[Kelvin wave|Kelvin]] waves. No one had realized how widespread these waves are. Thousands of kilometers wide, these waves are driven by wind under the influence of Earth’s rotation and are important mechanisms for transmitting climate signals across the large ocean basins. At high latitudes, they travel twice as fast as scientists believed previously, showing the ocean responds much more quickly to climate changes than was known before these missions.

===Ocean tides===
{{further|Tides}}
The precise measurements of TOPEX/Poseidon’s and Jason-1 have brought knowledge of ocean tides to an unprecedented level. The change of water level due to tidal motion in the deep ocean is known everywhere on the globe to within 2.5 centimeters (one inch). This new knowledge has revised notions about how tides dissipate. Instead of losing all their energy over shallow seas near the coasts, as previously believed, about one third of tidal energy is actually lost to the deep ocean. There, the energy is consumed by mixing water of different properties, a fundamental mechanism in the physics governing the general circulation of the ocean.

===Ocean Models===

TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 observations provided the first global data for improving the performance of the numerical ocean models that are a key component of climate prediction models.

TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1  data are available at the University of Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://argo.colorado.edu/~realtime/welcome/| title = CCAR Near Real-time Altimetry Data Homepage| publisher = University of Colorado| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080515212403/http://argo.colorado.edu/~realtime/welcome/| archivedate = 2008-05-15| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/| title = Physical Oceanography DAAC | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French data archive center AVISO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/| title = Aviso Altimetry | publisher = CNES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits to society ==
{{Tone|date=June 2008}}
Altimetry data have a wide variety of uses from basic scientific research on climate to ship routing. Applications include:

Climate Research: Altimetry data are incorporated into computer models to understand and predict changes in the distribution of heat in the ocean, a key element of climate.

[[El Niño]] &amp; La Niña Forecasting:  Understanding the pattern and effects of climate cycles such as El Niño helps predict and mitigate the disastrous effects of floods and drought.

[[Image:Wilma oct24 11am.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Altimetry reveals the ocean heat that can fuel hurricanes.]]

[[Hurricane]] Forecasting: Altimeter data and satellite ocean wind data are incorporated into atmospheric models for hurricane season forecasting and individual storm severity.

Ship Routing: Maps of [[ocean currents]], eddies, and vector winds are used in commercial shipping and recreational yachting to optimize routes.

Offshore Industries: Cable-laying vessels and offshore oil operations require accurate knowledge of ocean circulation patterns to minimize impacts from strong currents.

[[Marine Mammal]] Research: Sperm whales, fur seals, and other marine mammals can be tracked, and therefore studied, around ocean eddies where nutrients and plankton are abundant.

[[Fisheries]] Management: Satellite data identify ocean eddies which bring an increase in organisms that comprise the marine food web, attracting fish and fishermen.

[[Coral Reef]] Research: Remotely sensed data are used to monitor and assess coral reef ecosystems, which are sensitive to changes in ocean temperature.

[[Marine Debris]] Tracking: The amount of floating and partially submerged material, including nets, timber and ship debris, is increasing with human population. Altimetry can help locate these hazardous materials.

'''Johann Jacob Heber''' (1666–1727) was a [[surveying|surveyor]] and [[geometrician]] from the city of [[Lindau]], Germany.

[[Image:Lot map.PNG|frame|Diagram of an example '''house lot''' as seen from above, showing front and back lawns, positions of structures on the lot, and immediate surroundings. The lot boundaries are outlined in black except for the frontage, which is shown in red.  In this example, the immediate surroundings include a sidewalk, parkway, and section of street out in front and a section of alley in back.  Lot structures include a house, private walkways, and in back - a detached garage with driveway access to the alley and a small area for garbage.]]
In [[real estate]], a '''lot''' or '''plot''' is a tract or parcel of land owned or meant to be owned by some [[owner]](s).  A lot is essentially considered a parcel of [[real property]] in some countries or [[immovable property]] (meaning practically the same thing) in other countries.  Possible owner(s) of a lot can be one or more [[person]](s) or another legal entity, such as a company/[[corporation]], [[organization]], [[government]], or [[Trust company|trust]]. A common form of ownership of a lot is called [[fee simple]] in some countries.

A lot may also be defined as a small area of land that is empty except for pavement or similar improvement.  An example would be a [[parking lot]]. This article covers lots as parcels of land meant to be owned as units by an owner(s).

Like most other types of real estate, lots owned by private parties are subject to a periodic [[real estate tax]] payable by the owners to local governments such as a county or [[municipality]].  These real estate taxes are based on the assessed value of the real property; additional taxes usually apply to transfer of ownership and property sales.  Other fees by government are possible for improvements such as curbs and sidewalks or an [[impact fee]] for building a house on a vacant lot.

==Definition and boundaries==

A lot has defined boundaries (or borders) which are documented somewhere, but the boundaries need not be shown on the land itself.  Most lots are small enough to be [[map]]ped as if they are flat, in spite of the curvature of the earth.  A characteristic of the size of a lot is its [[area]].  The area is typically determined as if the land is flat and level, although the terrain of the lot may not be flat, i. e, the lot may be hilly.  The contour [[surface area]] of the land is changeable and may be too complicated for determining a lot's area.

Lots can come in various sizes and shapes.  To be considered a single lot, the land described as the "lot" must be contiguous.  Two separate parcels are considered two lots, not one.  Often a lot is sized for a single [[house]] or other building.  Many lots are rectangular in shape, although other shapes are possible as long as the boundaries are well-defined.  Methods of [[Land description|determining or documenting the boundaries of lots]] include [[metes and bounds]], [[Public Land Survey System|quadrant method]], and use of a [[plat]] diagram.  Use of the metes and bounds method may be compared to drawing a [[polygon]].  Metes are points which are like the vertices (corners) of a polygon.  Bounds are [[line segment]]s between two adjacent metes.  Bounds are usually straight lines, but can be curved as long as they are clearly defined.

When the boundaries of a lot are not indicated on the lot, a [[surveying|survey]] of the lot can be made to determine where the boundaries are according to the lot descriptions or plat diagrams.  Formal surveys are done by qualified [[surveying|surveyor]]s, who can make a diagram or map of the lot showing boundaries, dimensions, and the locations of any structures such as buildings, etc. Such surveys are also used to determine if there are any [[Structural encroachment|encroachment]]s to the lot. Surveyors can sometimes place posts at the metes of a lot.

The part of the boundary of the lot next to a street or road is the frontage.  Developers try to provide at least one side of frontage for every lot, so owners can have transportation access to their lots.  As the name implies, street frontage determines which side of the lot is the front, with the opposite side being the back. If the lot area is known, from the deed, then the frontage line can be calculated as depth by measuring the width (as area divided by width = depth). Sometimes minor, usually unnamed driveways called [[alley]]s, usually publicly owned, also provide access to the back of a lot.  When alleys are present, [[Garage (house)|garage]]s are often located in back of a lot with access from the alley.  Also when there are alleys, garbage collection may take place from the alley.  Lots at the corners of a block have two sides of frontage and are called corner lots.  Corner lots may have the advantage that a garage can be built with street access from the side, but have the disadvantage that there is more parkway [[lawn]] to mow and more sidewalk to shovel snow from. In areas with large blocks, homes are sometimes built in the center of the block. In this situation, the lot will usually include a long driveway to provide transportation access. Because the shape is reminiscent of a flag (the home) on a flag pole (the driveway), these lots are called flag lots.

==Development and use==
Local governments often pass [[zoning]] laws which control what buildings can be built on a lot and what they can be used for.  For example, certain areas are zoned for residential buildings such as houses.  Other areas can be commercially, agriculturally, or industrially zoned.  Sometimes zoning laws establish other restrictions, such as a minimum lot area and/or frontage length for building a house or other building, maximum building size, or minimum [[Setback (land use)|setbacks]] from a lot boundary for building a structure.  This is in addition to [[building code]]s which must be met.  Also, minimum lot sizes and separations must be met when [[Water well|well]]s and [[septic system]]s are used.  In urban areas, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s and water lines often provide service to households.  There may also be restrictions based on [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] established by private parties such as the [[real estate developer]].  There may be [[easement]]s for [[utility|utilities]] to run water, sewage, [[electric power]], or [[telephone]] lines through a lot.
[[File:BywaterMay07OldFenceLot.jpg|thumb|Vacant lot, with fencing]]
Something which is meant to improve the value or usefulness of a lot can be called an [[appurtenance]] to the lot.  Structures such as [[building]]s, [[driveway]]s, [[sidewalk]]s, patios or other pavement, [[Water well|well]]s, [[septic system]]s, signs, and similar improvements which are considered permanently attached to the land in the lot are considered to be real property, usually part of the lot but often parts of a building, such as [[condominium]]s, are owned separately.  Such structures owned by the lot owner(s), as well as easements which help the lot owners or users, can be considered appurtenances to the lot.  A lot without such structures can be called a vacant lot, urban prairie, spare ground, an empty lot, or an unimproved or undeveloped lot.

Many developers divide a large tract of land into lots as a [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]].  Certain areas of the land are dedicated (given to local government for permanent upkeep) as [[street]]s and sometimes [[alley]]s for transportation and access to lots.  Areas between the streets are divided up into lots to be sold to future owners.  The layout of the lots is [[map]]ped on a plat diagram, which is recorded with the government, typically the [[county]] [[Recorder of deeds|recorder's office]].  The [[City block|blocks]] between streets and the individual lots in each block are given an identifier, usually a number or letter.

Land originally granted by the government was commonly done by documents called [[land patent]]s.  Lots of land can be sold/bought by the owners or conveyed in other ways.  Such [[Conveyancing|conveyance]]s are made by documents called [[deed]]s which should be recorded by the government, typically the county recorder's office.  Deeds specify the lot by including a [[Land description|description]] such as one determined by the "metes and bounds" or quadrant methods, or referring to a lot number and block number in a recorded plat diagram.  Deeds often mention that appurtenances to the lot are included in order to convey any structures and other improvements also.

In front of many lots in urban areas, there are [[sidewalk]]s, usually publicly owned.  Beyond the sidewalk, there may sometimes be a strip of land called a [[road verge]], and then the [[carriageway|roadway]], being the drivable part of the [[road]].

As the oldest commercial television network in the UK, '''Independent Television''' (generally known as [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]) has employed many '''journalists and newsreaders''' to present its news programmes as well as to provide news reports and interviews during its long history.

Since the ITV network started [[Independent Television News]] Limited (ITN) has held the contract to produce national and international news for the ITV Network. Meanwhile, the regional ITV stations have provided local news programmes tailored for their regional audiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8232">This is a '''list of dishes found in Irish cuisine'''. [[Irish cuisine]] is a style of cooking originating from Ireland or developed by [[Irish people]]. It evolved from centuries of social and political change. The [[cuisine]] takes its influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in its [[temperate]] climate. The introduction of the [[potato]] in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced Ireland's cuisine thereafter and, as a result, is often closely associated with Ireland. Representative Irish dishes include [[Irish stew]], [[bacon and cabbage]], [[boxty]], [[coddle]], and [[colcannon]].

Beginning with ''[[Red's Dream]]'' and its references to previous [[Pixar Animation Studios|Pixar]] short films, Pixar has included references in its films to other works produced by the studio.&lt;ref name="pixarpedia" /&gt; These have included [[cameo appearance]]s, references to characters, objects, and titles of works. Additionally, such [[easter eggs]] or in-jokes can refer to Pixar staff, associates, or places or events from the company's past. Lastly, some items, such as [[A113]], '''Pizza Planet''' or actor [[John Ratzenberger]] have appeared in the majority of Pixar films, establishing a set of traditions that subsequent Pixar films try to include.

The following is a '''list of all documented self-referential nods contained within Pixar films''' and shorts that the various filmmakers have incorporated into their movies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18685">&lt;small&gt;''For NFLD, see [[Local Service District (Newfoundland and Labrador)]]''&lt;/small&gt;

A '''local service district''' (LSD) is an unincorporated unit of local governance in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[New Brunswick]]; LSDs are defined by Regulation 84-168, the ''Local Service Districts Regulation - Municipalities Act''.&lt;ref name="Reg84168"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Brunswick Regulation 84-168 under the Municipalities Act (O.C. 84-582)|url=http://laws.gnb.ca/en/showfulldoc/cr/84-168//|publisher=Government of New Brunswick|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the Municipalities Act was replaced by the Local Governance Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Governance Act (S.N.B. 2017, c. 18)|url=http://laws.gnb.ca/en/ShowTdm/cs/2017-c.18//|website=Attorney General|publisher=Province of New Brunswick|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continued Regulation 84-168.

== History ==

The Royal Commission on Finance and Municipal Taxation was established in 1962 by Order-in-Council 62-185, tasked with performing a comprehensive review of the province's municipal structures and taxation. The Commission's report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byrne|first1=Edward G.|last2=Boudreau|first2=Alexandre|last3=Andrews|first3=Arthur E.|last4=Ulderic|first4=Nadeau|last5=Wilson|first5=Charles N.|title=Report of the Royal Commission on Finance and Municipal Taxation in New Brunswick|date=1964|publisher=Province of New Brunswick|location=Fredericton, New Brunswick|url=https://lib.unb.ca/Texts/NBHistory/Commissions/ES81E/byrne_1E.html|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 1964, recommended sweeping changes in the provinces municipal structure, including abolishing the incorporated county municipalities that governed rural areas of the province. Those rural areas that provided one or two services normally provided by municipalities, primarily fire protection, would be served by local service districts.

The Municipalities Act of 1966 enacted the changes recommended by the Byrne Commission. Local service districts were established on November 23 by Order-in-Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Regulation 66-41 under the Municipalities Act (O.C. 66-965)|journal=The Royal Gazette|date=21 December 1966|volume=124|pages=604-605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

92 local service districts were established in 11 of the province's 15 counties. Gloucester (which today has more local service districts than any two other counties combined), Charlotte, Kings, and Northumberland Counties did not have any local service districts. Of the 92 LSDs, 86 were civil parishes; 81 provided only fire protection, while six added street lighting in at least part of the LSD, four added community services and recreational facilities, and one added garbage collection.

== Distribution ==

As of 1 July 2017 there are 237 LSDs. There have been an additional seventy-eight former LSDs, most of which were incorporated as, or absorbed by, municipalities. The number of concurrent LSDs peaked at 291 in 1991 and has been declining since 1995.

There are 133 Parish LSDs (plus fifteen former parish LSDs), which range from entire parishes, such as Cardwell, to areas left over after large numbers of LSDs have been separated, such as Shippegan. The parishes of Gagetown, Grand Manan, Hampstead have never had parish LSDs; Huskisson, while unstated in Regulation 84-168, is part of LSD the parish of Harcourt.

The remaining 104 LSDs (plus 62 former) vary in nature – three are school districts dating from the original creation of LSDs in 1966, one is an island, one a pair of islands, several are centralised communities like Elgin, most are decentralised communities or groups of communities (which can approach the size of parishes), and two resulted from mergers in 1996 (Chaleur) and 1999 (Allardville) that included three (two parish) and two (one parish) LSDs respectively.

== False LSDs ==

The number of LSDs is sometimes misstated, due to the existence of three units that can be confused with official LSDs: areas with increased or decreased services, Taxing Authorities, and Census Designated Places that are called Local Service Districts.

* Special areas (40 current plus 34 former) have been defined for different services than the parent LSD, usually street lighting. These does not seem to be an official term for such areas.
* 
* Taxing Authorities (316 in 2013) usually match LSDs and special areas, but can also be subdivisions of LSDs that do not differ in services or groupings of special areas. Names can also vary from the appropriate LSD or special area, with "the parish of" typically dropped from the names of parish LSDs and "Parish" sometimes appended for clarity. The taxing authorities of Calhoun Road, Havelock Inside, and Saint-Grégoire cross LSD boundaries.
* 
* Census Designated Places (DPL; 167 units in the 2011 census, including 41 parts of 19 divided DPLs) include current LSDs and special areas, as well as some former LSDs that have been incorporated into municipalities. The boundaries of DPLs don't always match those in Regulation 84-168, sometimes including isolated parts of parish LSDs bordering non-parish LSDs. The most pronounced variation from actual boundaries was with the local service district of the Parish of Saumarez, which consisted of the special area of [[Canton-des-Basques]] and five scattered pieces; the special area was classed as a DPL, and three other parts of the LSD were included in bordering LSDs for population counts and maps.
*

== Operation ==

Property owners are taxed a LSD rate arranged by the Province's Local Service District Manager to pay for services. These assessments may be for facilities situated in the LSD, services operated locally or purchased from a neighbouring municipality, or shared costs of operation of facilities in a municipality. LSDs that become rural communities are subject to LSD taxes for services provided by the province.

The base rate, which includes fire protection, is $0.6315 per $100 of assessed value for owner-occupied residential properties. Non owner-occupied residential properties pay provincial tax as well as any taxes for services beyond fire protection; business pay 50% more than the total rate for non owner-occupied residential properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property Tax 101|url=http://welcomenb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Corporate/pdf/Promos-LG/property-taxation/property_tax_101.pdf|publisher=Government of New Brunswick|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==

Originally all services within LSDs were voluntary, administered by area citizens and paid for by local property taxes. The provincial government has gradually taken over the administration of some services at the provincial level, with regional service commissions taking over many others. Regulation 84-168 has not kept up with these changes in administration, updating listed services only when boundary changes or addition of new services have taken place. Fire protection and recreational facilities are often paid for through cost-sharing with municipalities or other LSDs.

Services within LSDs can be grouped into two categories - mandatory and voluntary services. Mandatory services are:
*animal control
*dangerous or unsightly premises enforcement
*emergency measures
*fire protection
*land use planning
*rescue services
*police protection
*solid waste collection and disposal.
Voluntary services include, but are not limited to:
*street lighting
*recreational and sports facilities

== Local participation ==

Local service districts have always had the ability to elect advisory committees; the requirements for establishing such committees have changed since 1966.

Currently 25 or more residents who are qualified to vote under the Elections Act may petition the Minister of Local Government to call a meeting for the purpose of electing a committee; a simple majority vote at such a meeting is sufficient to establish a committee. There is no minimum number of voters required to elect or re-elect an advisory committee. LSD advisory committees are elected for a term of four years according to the government's cycle for general municipal elections. Elections may be held outside municipal election years if replacing a dissolved committee or establishing a committee in an LSD that previously lacked one. LSDAC elections are handled by the Department of Local Government, not [[Elections New Brunswick]]; because of this, elections do not require normal polling hours, nor do they require widespread advertising or a centralised website that lists them, often resulting in low voter turnout.

LSDs may establish an advisory committee of three to five members if a public meeting with sufficient eligible voters is held. LSD advisory committees are disbanded if their membership falls below three. The Committees have no legislative or taxing authority, but work with the Local Service District Manager to administer services and set local budgets.

Advisory committee presidents are asked to participate on regional service commission boards. A certain amount of consulting and service contracts are awarded as a result of LSD service activity, which provide economic activities.

== Local governance reform ==

The provincial government has been encouraging local service districts to participate in reforming government administration in rural areas.&lt;! citation will follow&gt; The [[List of rural communities in New Brunswick|rural community]], an incorporated but non-municipal body, has been the most common model, although incorporation into existing municipalities has also been pursued. Since 2006 a total of 24 LSDs have become incorporated into rural communities or municipalities:
*[[Cocagne, New Brunswick|Cocagne]], [[Hanwell, New Brunswick|Hanwell]], and [[Upper Miramichi, New Brunswick|Upper Miramichi]] have become rural communities with the same name, while [[Campobello Parish, New Brunswick|the parish of Campobello]] incorporated as the rural community of [[Campobello Island]].
*The parish of Saint-André merged with the incorporated village of St. André to form the rural community of [[Saint-André, New Brunswick|Saint-André]].
*[[Grimmer Parish, New Brunswick|the parish of Grimmer]] merged with the incorporated village of Kedgwick to form the rural community of [[Kedgwick, New Brunswick|Kedgwick]].
*Eighteen LSDs (and parts of two others) merged with the incorporated town of Tracadie-Sheila to form the regional municipality of Grand Tracadie-Sheila, which has since changed its name to [[Regional Municipality of Tracadie|Tracadie]].

There have been dozens of other projects that are still in progress or have failed for various reasons, some reaching the plebiscite stage, many simply lacking local support to proceed to asking the government to conduct a feasibility study.

There have been at least two attempts by municipalities in Millville and Norton to devolve to local service districts, both rejected by the provincial government.

== Criticisms ==

The term 'Democratic deficit' was used by Jean-Guy Finn (Local Governance Task Force, 2010) to describe an "unbalanced local government", as in: many residents without representation at a local level (35% of population and 90% of the provincial territory) and limited competition for elected offices (1/3 of municipal councils with less than 2000 pop acclaimed) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpeim.ca/pdf/jean-guy%20finn.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boundary issues ==

The boundary descriptions of LSDs have not sometimes suffered from ambiguous language or lack of update of existing LSD boundaries when a new entity was created. Originally most LSDs were defined by parish boundaries or grant lines; in the 1980s provincial property identity numbers began replacing grant lines; since the mid-2000s maps showing property lines have been the norm. All methods have led to problems:
*Some original LSDs referenced school district boundaries, especially in [[Restigouche County, New Brunswick|Restigouche County]], as did the later Black River-Hardwicke. There is no consolidated record of former school district boundaries in New Brunswick; the surviving records are scattered among various record series or documents and it is likely some records were destroyed.
*Grant-based descriptions often refer to groups of grants without reference to smaller grants or ungranted land within tiers of large grants.
*Expropriated land can create ambiguity when using grant lines. Dugas does not explicitly mention that the southern boundary of grants was after land was expropriated for the [[Village historique acadien]].
*References to direction, ''e.g.'' "northern corner" are sometimes based on map orientation rather than geographic coordinates.
*Boundaries can overlap, usually due to a description of an older LSD not being updated when a new one was created. The Paroisse Notre-Dame-des-Érables overlaps with New Bandon-Salmon Beach where the actual grant lines are used by one and a prolongation of a grant line is used by the other
*Poirier, which was established after the village of [[Maisonnette, New Brunswick|Maisonnette]] was incorporated, explicitly includes one land grant that is within the village.
*Descriptions based on provincial property IDs suffer from properties being subdivided or consolidated. The province does not maintain a consolidated list of changes in property identity numbers.
*Descriptions based on property lines that reference parish lines will sometimes include properties that are wholly within other parishes.
*The use of property maps when updating boundary descriptions sometimes confuse taxation authority boundaries for those of LSDs. The most recent update of the boundaries of Tabusintac removed one property on the boundary of [[Neguac, New Brunswick|Neguac]] while removing part of a property crossed by a stream formerly used to define the boundary with Fair Isle. The update of the parish of Woodstock following an expansion of the town of [[Woodstock, New Brunswick|Woodstock]] extended the LSD's boundaries into [[Richmond Parish, New Brunswick|Richmond Parish]].

'''''Background'''''

The '''Malaysian Remote Sensing Agency (MRSA)'''  (Malay: Agensi Remote Sensing Malaysia (ARSM))  is a department responsible for [[remote sensing]] under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), Malaysia. MRSA was established in August 1988 as a [[Research and development|Research and Development]] centre in remote sensing and related technologies. Formerly known as [[Malaysian Centre of Remote Sensing]] (MACRES) or Pusat Remote Sensing Negara, MRSA was fully operational by January 1990. MRSA started with a team of 17 professionals and supporting staff, by 2018, the total post has been increased to 226 professionals.

'''''Facilities'''''

MRSA is equipped with [[computer system]] for satellite data [[image processing]], [[Geographic Information System|geographic information system]] and [[Global Positioning System|global positioning system]], a satellite ground receiving station for real time [[data acquisition]], microwave remote sensing laboratory ([[anechoic chamber]], mobile scatterometer), remote sensing digital photographic laboratory and remote sensing data archiving and retrieval centre.

      <comment>/* The "great fleet" hypothesis */  ref</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7846">Various [[Māori mythology|Māori traditions]] recount how their ancestors set out from their homeland in great ocean-going '''canoes''' (or '''[[Waka (canoe)|waka]]'''). Some of these traditions name a mythical homeland called [[Hawaiki]].

Among these is the story of [[Kupe]], who had eloped with [[Kuramarotini]], the wife of [[Hoturapa]], the owner of the great canoe ''[[Matahourua]]'', whom Kupe had murdered. To escape punishment for the murder, Kupe and Kura fled in Matahourua and discovered a land he called [[Aotearoa]] ('long-white-cloud').  He explored its coast and killed the sea monster [[Te Wheke-a-Muturangi]], finally returning to his home to spread news of his newly discovered land.&lt;ref&gt;However according to K.R. Howe in ''Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand'', "Kupe was not a well-known figure in tradition" and his position as the discover of New Zealand is "a fabrication". See [http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/IdeasOfMaoriOrigins/5/en Ideas of Māori origins, 1920s–2000, New Understanding].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other stories of various tribes report migrations to escape famine, over-population, and warfare.  These were made in legendary canoes, the best known of which are ''[[Aotea (canoe)|Aotea]]'', ''[[Arawa (canoe)|Te Arawa]]'', ''[[Kurahaupō]]'', ''[[Mātaatua]]'', ''[[Tainui (canoe)|Tainui]]'', ''[[Tākitimu]]'',  and ''[[Tokomaru (canoe)|Tokomaru]]''. Various traditions name numerous other canoes. Some, including the ''[[Āraiteuru]]'', are well known; others including the ''Kirauta'' and the sacred ''[[Arahura (canoe)|Arahura]]'' and ''[[Mahangaatuamatua]]'' are little known. Rather than arriving in a single fleet, the journeys may have occurred over several centuries.

==The "great fleet" hypothesis==
[[File:Polynesian Migration.svg|thumb|250px|Possible migration routes of the Polynesians]]
[[Percy Smith (ethnologist)|Percy Smith]] believed that while the Polynesian traditions may have been flawed in detail, they preserved the threads of truth which could be recovered using a method already well established for Hawaiian traditions by [[Abraham Fornander]] (1878–1885). This method involved seeking out common elements of tradition from different sources, and aligning these to genealogies to give a time frame for the events. Fornander, Smith, and others used this method to reconstruct the migrations of the Polynesians, tracing them back to a supposed ancient homeland in India.
 
Smith used the Fornander method, combining disparate traditions from various parts of New Zealand and other parts of Polynesia, to derive the 'Great Fleet' hypothesis. Through an examination of the genealogies of various tribes, he came up with a set of precise dates for the Great Fleet and the explorers that he and others posited as having paved the way for the fleet.

According to ''[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]'', "Smith’s account went as follows. In 750 AD the Polynesian explorer Kupe discovered an uninhabited New Zealand. Then in 1000–1100 AD, the Polynesian explorers [[Toi (name)|Toi]] and Whātonga visited New Zealand, and found it inhabited by a primitive, nomadic people known as the [[Moriori people|Moriori]]. Finally, in 1350 AD a ‘great fleet’ of seven canoes – ''[[Aotea (canoe)|Aotea]]'', ''[[Kurahaupō]]'', ''[[Mātaatua]]'', ''[[Tainui (canoe)|Tainui]]'', ''[[Tokomaru (canoe)|Tokomaru]]'', ''[[Arawa (canoe)|Te Arawa]]'' and ''[[Tākitimu]]'' – all departed from the Tahitian region at the same time, bringing the people now known as Māori to New Zealand. These were advanced, warlike, agricultural tribes who destroyed the Moriori."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/IdeasOfMaoriOrigins/en Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand: Ideas of Māori Origins]&lt;/ref&gt;

The great fleet scenario won general acceptance, its adherents including the respected Māori ethnologist [[Te Rangi Hīroa]] (Sir Peter Buck), and was taught in New Zealand schools. However it was effectively demolished during the 1960s by the ethnologist [[David Simmons (ethnologist)|David Simmons]], who showed that it derived from an incomplete and indiscriminate study of Māori tradition as recorded in the 19th Century. Simmons also suggests that some of these 'migrations' may actually have been journeys within New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Howe puts it more strongly, stating that Smith's great fleet was "a fabrication", and that Simmons "also demonstrated that Smith manipulated tradition and other evidence to produce the story he wanted." [http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/IdeasOfMaoriOrigins/5/en Ideas of Māori origins, 1920s–2000, New Understanding].&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Rāwiri Taonui, writing in 2006 for the website ''Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand'', accuses Smith of falsification: "The Great Fleet theory was the result of a collaboration between the 19th-century ethnologist S. Percy Smith and the Māori scholar [[Hoani Te Whatahoro Jury]]. Smith obtained details about places in Rarotonga and Tahiti during a visit in 1897, while Jury provided information about Māori canoes in New Zealand. Smith then ‘cut and pasted’ his material, combining several oral traditions into new ones. Their joint work was published in two books, in which Jury and Smith falsely attributed much of their information to two 19th-century tohunga, Moihi Te Mātorohanga and Nēpia Pōhūhū"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Taonui |first1=Rāwiri |title=The meaning of canoe traditions |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/canoe-traditions/page-1 |website=Te Ara |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Old Man of Hoy, Orkney - geograph.org.uk - 8878.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Old Man of Hoy from the north]]

The '''Old Man of Hoy''' is a 449-foot (137m) [[Stack (geology)|sea stack]] on the island of [[Hoy]], part of the [[Orkney]] [[archipelago]] off the north coast of [[Scotland]]. Formed from [[Old Red Sandstone]], it is one of the tallest stacks in Britain. The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through [[hydraulic action]] some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, but may soon collapse into the sea.

Winds are faster than {{convert|8|m/s|mph}} for nearly a third of the time, and gales occur on average for 29 days a year. Combined with the depth of the sea, which quickly falls to {{Convert|60|m}}, high-energy waves on the western side of Hoy lead to rapid [[erosion]] of the coast.&lt;ref name="jncc"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2304.pdf |title=West Coast of Orkney |last=Hansom |first=Jim |year=2007 |publisher=JNCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The Old Man of Hoy is a [[Old Red Sandstone|red sandstone]] stack, perched on a [[plinth]] of [[basalt]] rock, and one of the tallest sea stacks in Britain.{{sfn|Seward|2011|p=230}}&lt;ref name=wlg/&gt; It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200&amp;nbsp;ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide.&lt;ref name=jncc/&gt; The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly [[sandstone]] and harder [[flagstone]]s of [[Old Red Sandstone]], giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00369229518736960 |title=The old man of Hoy |year=1995 |last1=Hansom |first1=James D. |last2=Evans |first2=David J.

==History==
[[File:William Daniell Old Man of Hoy (colour).jpg|thumb|left|A painting by [[William Daniell]] of the Old Man with two legs, some time around 1817.]]

===Climbing===
[[File:Old man of hoy.jpg|thumb|upright|The Old Man of Hoy]]
The stack was first climbed by mountaineers [[Chris Bonington]], Rusty Baillie and [[Tom Patey]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Mountaineering Council of Scotland |title=1966 climb: The Old Man of Hoy |url=http://www.mountaineering-scotland.org.uk/climbthru/1966hoy.html |accessdate=25 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810022955/http://www.mountaineering-scotland.org.uk/climbthru/1966hoy.html |archivedate=10 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2011|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 8–9 July 1967, an ascent featured in ''The Great Climb'', a live [[BBC]] three-night [[outside broadcasting|outside broadcast]], which had around 15 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/greatclimb/sec3_pg3.shtml|publisher=BBC Scotland |title=The Great Climb |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This featured three pairs of climbers: Bonington and Patey repeated their original route, whilst two new lines were climbed by [[Joe Brown (climber)|Joe Brown]] and [[Ian McNaught-Davis]] and by Pete Crew and [[Dougal Haston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latter|2009|p=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Szell became the first blind person to climb the Old Man, despite suffering from [[retinitis pigmentosa]] that left him with 5% vision. With assistance from Martin Moran and Nick Carter, he scaled the stack in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.grough.co.uk/magazine/2013/06/30/blind-climber-red-szell-old-man-of-hoy-ascent-was-dream-come-true |title=Blind climber Red Széll: Old Man of Hoy ascent was dream come true |author=Liz Roberts |date=30 June 2013 |work=grough |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thebmc.co.uk/old-man-of-hoy-success-for-blind-climber |title=Old Man of Hoy success for blind climber |author=Tina Gardner |date=28 June 2013 |work=British Mountaineering Council |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

The youngest person to climb the Old Man is Edward Mills, who was 8 years old when he completed the climb in 4 hours 55 minutes on 9 June 2018, to raise money for the charity ''Climbers Against Cancer'' as his mother had terminal breast cancer. He was accompanied by his trainers, Ben West and Cailean Harker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-44423914 |title=Boy, 8, youngest to climb Old Man of Hoy|date=10 June 2018 |work=BBC |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are seven routes up the stack, the most commonly used of which is the original landward facing [[Grade (climbing)#Adjectival grade|E1]] (Extremely Severe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orkney-seastacks.co.uk/oldman.htm |title=The Old Man of Hoy |publisher=orkney-seastacks.co.uk |accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/page.php?id=69 |title=The Old Man of Hoy: the routes |author=Chris Mellor |publisher=UKClimbing |accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A log book in a [[Tupperware]] container is buried in a [[cairn]] on the summit, as an ascensionists' record.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/page.php?id=5602 |title=The Blind Man of Hoy |author=Red Szell |publisher=UKClimbing |accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bear&gt;{{harvnb|Grylls|2009|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as fifty ascents of the stack are made each year.&lt;ref name=bear/&gt;

The '''Ordnance Survey National Grid reference system''' is a system of geographic grid references used in Great Britain, distinct from [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. It is often called '''British National Grid''' ('''BNG''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/27700/|title=OSGB 1936 / British National Grid: EPSG Projection  -- Spatial Reference|website=spatialreference.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communityhub.esriuk.com/geoxchange/2012/3/26/coordinate-systems-and-projections-for-beginners.html|title=Coordinate systems and projections for beginners|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ordnance Survey]] (OS) devised the national [[grid reference]] system, and it is heavily used in their survey data, and in maps based on those surveys, whether published by the Ordnance Survey or by commercial map producers. Grid references are also commonly quoted in other publications and data sources, such as guide books and government planning documents.

A number of different systems exist that can provide grid references for locations within the [[British Isles]]: this article describes the system created solely for Great Britain and its outlying islands (including the [[Isle of Man]]); the [[Irish grid reference system]] was a similar system created by the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] and the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] for the island of Ireland.  The [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]] (UTM) is used to provide grid references for worldwide locations, and this is the system commonly used for the [[Channel Islands]] and Ireland ([[Irish Transverse Mercator|since 2001]]). European-wide agencies also use UTM when mapping locations, or may use the [[Military Grid Reference System]] (MGRS) system, or variants of it.

== General ==
[[Image:Ordnance Survey 1-250000 - TF.jpg|thumb|Grid square TF. The map shows [[The Wash]] and the [[North Sea]], as well as places within the counties of [[Lincolnshire]], Cambridgeshire and [[Norfolk]].]]

The grid is based on the ''OSGB36''  [[map datum|datum]] (Ordnance Survey Great Britain 1936,{{cn|date=February 2017}} based on the [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]] 1830 [[Reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]]),{{cn|date=February 2017}} and was introduced after the [[retriangulation of Great Britain|retriangulation of 1936–1962]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} It replaced the previously used [[Cassini Grid]] which,{{cn|date=February 2017}} up to the end of [[World War Two]], had been issued only to the military.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The Airy ellipsoid is a regional best fit for Britain; more modern mapping tends to use the GRS80 ellipsoid used by the [[Global Positioning System]] (the Airy ellipsoid assumes the Earth to be about 1&amp;nbsp;km smaller in diameter than the GRS80 ellipsoid, and to be slightly less flattened). The British maps adopt a [[Transverse Mercator projection]] with an origin (the "true" origin) at [[49th parallel north|49°&amp;nbsp;N]], [[2nd meridian west|2°&amp;nbsp;W]] (an offshore point in the [[English Channel]] which lies between the island of [[Jersey]] and the French port of [[Saint-Malo|St. Malo]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#OSNet|OS Net, The true origin]]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the Airy ellipsoid a straight line grid, the National Grid, is placed with a new false origin to eliminate negative numbers, creating a 700&amp;nbsp;km by 1300&amp;nbsp;km grid. This false origin is located south-west of the Isles of Scilly. The distortion created between the OS grid and the projection is countered by a scale factor in the longitude to create two lines of longitude with zero distortion rather than one. Grid north and true north are only aligned on the 400&amp;nbsp;km easting of the grid which is 2°&amp;nbsp;W (OSGB36) and approx. {{nowrap|2° 0′ 5″ W}} ([[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]]).

OSGB 36 was also used by [[Admiralty]] [[nautical chart]]s until 2000{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} after which [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]] has been used.

A [[Geodesy|geodetic]] transformation between OSGB 36 and other terrestrial reference systems (like [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF2000]], [[ETRS89]], or [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]]) can become quite tedious if attempted manually. The most common transformation is called the [[Helmert transformation|Helmert datum transformation]], which results in a typical 7&amp;nbsp;m error from true. The definitive transformation from ETRS89 that is published by the OSGB is called the National Grid Transformation OSTN15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/help-and-support/navigation-technology/os-net/surveying.html|title=Surveying guidelines|publisher=Ordnance Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This models the detailed distortions in the 1936–1962 retriangulation, and achieves backwards compatibility in grid coordinates to sub-metre accuracy.

=== Datum shift between OSGB 36 and WGS 84 ===
The difference between the coordinates on different datums varies from place to place. The [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] positions on OSGB 36 are the same as for [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]] at a point in the Atlantic Ocean well to the west of Great Britain. In [[Cornwall]], the WGS 84 longitude ''lines'' are about 70 metres east of their OSGB 36 equivalents, this value rising gradually to about 120&amp;nbsp;m east on the east coast of [[East Anglia]]. The WGS 84 latitude ''lines'' are about 70&amp;nbsp;m south of the OSGB 36 lines in South [[Cornwall]], the difference diminishing to zero in the [[Scottish Borders]], and then increasing to about 50&amp;nbsp;m north on the north coast of [[Scotland]]. (If the ''lines'' are further ''east'', then the longitude ''value'' of any given point is further ''west''. Similarly, if the lines are further south, the values will give the point a more northerly latitude.) The smallest datum shift is on the west coast of Scotland and the greatest in [[Kent]].

=== Datum shift between OSGB 36 and ED 50 ===
These two datums are not both in general use in any one place, but for a point in the [[English Channel]] halfway between [[Dover]] and [[Calais]], the [[ED50]] longitude lines are about 20&amp;nbsp;m east of the OSGB36 equivalents, and the ED50 latitude lines are about 150&amp;nbsp;m south of the OSGB36 ones.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Grid letters ==
[[Image:British National Grid.svg|right]]
For the first letter, the grid is divided into squares of size 500&amp;nbsp;km by 500&amp;nbsp;km, outlined in dark grey  on the map to the right. There are four of these which contain significant land area within Great Britain: S, T, N and H.  The O square contains a tiny area of [[North Yorkshire]], almost all of which lies below mean high tide.&lt;ref&gt;Standing, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

For the second letter, each 500&amp;nbsp;km square is subdivided into 25 squares of size 100&amp;nbsp;km by 100&amp;nbsp;km, each with a letter code from A to Z (omitting I) starting with A in the north-west corner to Z in the south-east corner. These squares are outlined in light grey on the map, with those containing land lettered. The central (2° W) meridian is shown in red.

== Grid digits ==
Within each square, ''eastings'' and ''northings'' from the south west corner of the square are given numerically. For example, NH0325 means a 1&amp;nbsp;km square whose south-west corner is 3&amp;nbsp;km east and 25&amp;nbsp;km north from the south-west corner of square NH.  A location can be indicated to varying resolutions numerically, usually from two digits in each coordinate (for a 1&amp;nbsp;km square) through to five (for a 1&amp;nbsp;m square); in each case the first half of the digits is for the first coordinate and the second half for the other. The most common usage is the ''six figure grid reference'', employing three digits in each coordinate to determine a 100&amp;nbsp;m square. For example, the grid reference of the 100&amp;nbsp;m square containing the summit of [[Ben Nevis]] is '''{{gbmaprim|NN166712|NN 166 712}}'''.  (Grid references may be written with or without spaces; e.g., also NN166712.) NN has an easting of 200&amp;nbsp;km and northing of 700&amp;nbsp;km, so the OSGB36 National Grid location for Ben Nevis is at 216600, 771200.

== All-numeric grid references ==
Grid references may also be quoted as a pair of numbers: eastings then northings in metres, measured from the southwest corner of the SV square. Note that 14 digits may be required for locations in [[Orkney]] and further north. For example, the grid reference for [[Sullom Voe|Sullom Voe oil terminal]] in the Shetland Islands may be given as {{mmukscaled|HU396753|25|HU396753}} or {{GBvosi|e=0439668|n=1175316|cty=|txt=439668,1175316}}.

Another, distinct, form of all-numeric grid reference is an abbreviated alphanumeric reference where the letters are simply omitted, e.g. 166712 for the summit of Ben Nevis.  Unlike the numeric references described above, this abbreviated grid reference is incomplete; it gives the location relative to an OS 100×100&amp;nbsp;km&amp;nbsp;square, but does not specify which square. It is often used informally when the context identifies the OS 2-letter square.  For example, within the context of a location known to be on [[Ordnance Survey#GB map range|OS Landranger sheet]] 41 (which extends from NN000500 in the south-west to NN400900 in the north-east) the abbreviated grid reference 166712 is equivalent to NN166712.  If working with more than one Landranger sheet, this may also be given as 41/166712.

Alternatively, sometimes numbers instead of the two-letter combinations are used for the 100×100&amp;nbsp;km squares.  The numbering follows a grid index where the tens denote the progress from West to East and the units from South to North.  In the north of Scotland, the numbering is modified: the 100&amp;nbsp;km square to the north of 39 is numbered N30; the square to the north of 49 is N40, etc.

'''Selma Barkham''', [[Order of Canada|OC]], (née Huxley; born 1927, London, England) is a Canadian historian and geographer of international standing in the fields of the maritime history of [[Canada]] and of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letstravel.ca/image/dr-selma-barkham Let's Travel.ca: Selma Barkham]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1972, as an independent researcher, she moved to the Basque Country to do archival research on an aspect of Canadian and Basque history about which very little was known: Basque fisheries in the old [[Newfoundland|Terra Nova]], today some 2,000 kilometres of the Atlantic coast of Canada, in the 16th and 17th centuries.  
 
The research she carried out during the following years, mostly in Basque, Spanish and Portuguese archives, allowed her to make important archival, historical and archaeological discoveries. She found thousands of documents with which she was able to reconstruct most elements of a largely unknown chapter of the history of Canada and of the Basque Country: the Basque cod and whale fisheries in Terra Nova especially in the 16th century. She discovered the existence of a 16th-century Basque whaling industry in southern Labrador and adjacent Quebec, their whaling ports, archaeological remains of their bases, as well as the presence of Basque galleons sunk in those ports, among them the San Juan (1565).
 
In 1981, she was awarded the [[Order of Canada]] for her pioneering work and for having made "one of the most outstanding contributions, in recent years, to the story of this nation". One of those whaling ports found by her, present-day Red Bay, Labrador, has been declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] (1979) and a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] (June 2013).

== Family and youth ==

Selma Huxley was born in England in the midst of a family of intellectuals and scientists. Her father, Michael Huxley, a diplomat and the founder-editor of the [[Geographical Magazine]], whose cousins included the writer [[Aldous Huxley]] and his brother the biologist Sir [[Julian Huxley]] (first Director General of UNESCO), was a grandson of the eminent English scientist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] known as "Darwin's Bulldog". Her mother, Ottilie de Lotbinière Mills, was a granddaughter of the Canadian politician and conservationist Sir Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, who was a Cabinet minister in the Government of Canada and Premier of the province of Québec.
 
She spent her teenage years during the Second World War in England and the United States. When the war ended she studied at the universities of Paris and London.

== From England to Canada and the Basque Country ==

In 1950 she decided to spend some time visiting relatives in Canada where she settled in Montreal, working for the Yellow Pages, as a teacher and finally as the Librarian of the Arctic Institute of North America at the University of McGill.
 
There, in 1953, she met her future husband a young English architect, Brian Barkham, who was deeply fond of the Basque Country. In the summer of 1950, he had left England on motorcycle, with a fellow student of the University of London, John Stoddart, to study the rural architecture of Andalucía in southern Spain. But, due to various circumstances, he had ended up in the Basque Country studying its caseríos (farmhouses), which would be the subject of his degree thesis. He and his companion made good friends and fell in love with that region, with the result that they returned to the Basque Country in the summer of 1951.
 
Huxley could not have known then that that meeting was going to change her life so much, nor that in the future her own research on the Basque Country would lead her to make discoveries of importance to Basque and Canadian history. In 1954, the newly married couple moved to Ottawa, the capital of Canada, where Barkham set up an architecture practice and they started a family (Children: Thomas, Oriana, Michael and [https://www.blanquerna.edu/es/fcc Serena]). Two years later, they visited the Basque Country where a friend, the priest Don Pío de Montoya, spoke to them about the old Basque presence in Canada.

== Conceiving a plan for the future ==

In 1964, aged 37, Selma Barkham was left a widow with four children under the age of ten and had to find a way of making a living. She worked mostly for the National Historic Sites as a historian on various projects. These included the restoration of [[Fortress of Louisbourg|Louisbourg]], the 18th-century French fortress and commercial-fishing port on [[Cape Breton Island]] on the Atlantic coast of Canada.
 
Doing that she became interested in European fishing voyages to that region in previous centuries, especially from the Basque Country with which she had personal ties. She developed a plan to research, in archives of Spain and France, Basque fisheries in Canada in the 16th and 17th centuries, thereby combining her personal and intellectual interests. She knew that for that she would have to learn Spanish, she already spoke English and French.
 
At that time, the late 1960s, it was recognized that there had been Basque cod fishing and whaling expeditions to Terra Nova in those centuries, but there was very little documentary information about them.
  
== Mexico and return to the Basque Country ==

In 1969, she decided to move to Mexico with her children by car, where she supported her family as an English teacher. Three years later, in 1972, she applied from there for a grant from the Canada Council to begin her research. Following that, she put her family and belongings aboard a cargo ship bound for the Basque port of [[Bilbao]].
 
However, she would not begin that research backed and financed by an institution, but rather on her own, with little means and against expectations. Shortly after her arrival in Bilbao, she received the news that her grant application had been turned down. It was thought that that work had already been done.
 
Barkham found herself without a job, with hardly any money and without clear perspectives. Those were difficult times but she did not give up. She believed that the archives could contain valuable information. During the first year she taught English and studied Spanish [[paleography]] in the evening at the [[University of Deusto]]. She received a thousand dollars from an anonymous Canadian donor, which allowed her to pay the rent, and she began making her first finds of importance in archives.
 
On the basis of these, in 1973 she managed to negotiate a contract with the Public Archives of Canada to locate in Spain documentation of interest to Canada. But the contract, which would be renewable, was part-time and there was not a budget for a telephone or car. The rest of the time she pursued her own research. That year she moved to the inland Basque town of [[Oñati]], realizing the richness of the virtually unused Archivo Histórico de Protocolos de Gipuzkoa &lt;ref&gt;[http://oinati.gipuzkoakultura.net Archivo Histórico de Protocolos de Gipuzkoa website] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; located there, where she was to live for twenty years.

== Archival finds and historical reconstruction ==

Over the years she researched in some 40 archives - parish, municipal, notarial, judicial, etc. - in places such as Tolosa, Bilbao, Burgos, Valladolid, Madrid, Seville and Lisbon. Little by little she discovered thousands of manuscripts from the 16th and 17th centuries, mostly in old Spanish, relating to the Basque fisheries in Terra Nova: including insurance policies, lawsuits, wills, charter-parties, crew agreements and lists of provisions and equipment. She also gradually found thousands of manuscripts to do with the other sectors of the Basque maritime economy such as shipbuilding, trade and fishing in Europe.
 
This detailed documentation allowed her to establish that the Basques had carried out, in different specific areas of Atlantic Canada, a prosperous cod fishery as well as a major whale fishery on an industrial scale during the 1500s. Furthering her analysis of these documents, she was able to reconstruct most aspects of those Basque fisheries particularly in the 16th century: their scale and evolution, the organization and financing of the expeditions, types of ships, composition of crews, routes and destinations, fishing and whaling seasons, shipwrecks, the sailors' life, work and death, their food and clothing, contact with Amerindians, markets, etc.

== Basque destinations in Canada ==

Regarding the destination of the ships until the end of that century the manuscripts showed Barkham that, in contrast to the cod fishing vessels, the whalers went to about twelve ports of an area of Terra Nova that the Basques called the "Gran Baya".  She studied other written sources, such as sailing directions, and maps and charts of the time in places like the national libraries of England and France.
 
This enabled her to determine that the codfishers mostly used ports of what is now the south-east of the island of Newfoundland. In relation to the whaling activity she concluded that the "Gran Baya" corresponded to the present-day Strait of [[Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Belle Isle]], which separates Newfoundland from Labrador, and that the old whaling ports, mentioned in the archival documents, were situated along the north shore of the Strait of Belle Isle, or the south coast of Labrador and a small section of the Quebec coast.
 
Crucially, she managed to identify the location of most of the individual whaling ports and their modern names. In this way, for example, Gradun became present-day Middle Bay, Puerto Bretón became Carrol Cove and Buttes, the most important port, became Red Bay. Therefore, she had not only made known the existence of a 16th-century Basque whaling industry in Labrador and adjacent Quebec but also their whaling ports.
 
The archives revealed three unique manuscripts from that century which had been written on that very coast: a sale of chalupas (whaleboats) (1572) and two wills (1577 and 1584). These were the oldest original civil documents written in Canada.

== Archaeological finds in Labrador and Quebec ==

Barkham knew from the documentation that in those ports there had to be remains of the Basque whaling presence, both on land and under water, and she wanted to find them. Backed by her research so far, she organized an archaeological survey expedition to southern Labrador in the summer of 1977, with a grant from the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]]. She explored several harbours along the coast and discovered archaeological remains of Basque whaling bases, including at Red Bay, thereby confirming her historical work in Europe. The expedition was joined by, among others, archaeologist James Tuck of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]].
 
Among the manuscripts found by the researcher are some that refer to the sinking of several 16th-century Basque whaling galleons in specific ports of the "Gran Baya", whose modern names she had identified on the Labrador coast: one from [[Pasaia]] (1563) in Los Hornos (Pinware Bay), the Madalena from [[Mutriku]] (1565) and the María from [[San Sebastián]] (1572) in Chateo (Chateau Bay/Henley Harbour), and the San Juan from Pasaia (1565) and the Madalena from [[Bordeaux]] (1574/75) in Buttes (Red Bay).
 
The year after Barkham's expedition, in 1978, a team of underwater archaeologists from [[Parks Canada]] led by Robert Grenier, basing themselves on the historian's discoveries and on the detailed information she had provided them, conducted surveys at [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]] and [[Chateau Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Chateau Bay]]. They located a wreck in both harbours which turned out to be 16th-century whaling ships. The press conference announcing these finds was held at the [[Library and Archives Canada|Public Archives of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/lifestyle/travel/unesco-world-heritage-sites-in-canada/basque-whaling-site-uncovered-in-red-bay-labrador.html CBC.ca: Basque whaling site uncovered in Red Bay, Labrador]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.mun.ca/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/extension&amp;CISOPTR=2570&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=5 MUN.ca: The Basque Whalers of Red Bay]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From then on, Barkham continued her historico-geographical work parallel to the land and underwater excavations, under Tuck and Grenier respectively, at Red Bay which was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1979.&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2013/06/02/nl-basque-red-bay-unesco-603.html CBC.ca: Labrador Basque site vying for UNESCO heritage status]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1982, she organized another expedition, this time by sailing boat from Cape Breton Island to southern Labrador and the Quebec North Shore. She identified 17th-century Basque cod fishing locations on the west coast of Newfoundland while, at Middle Bay and Five Leagues Harbour on the Quebec coast, she found further archaeological remains of the 16th-century Basque whaling presence.

== Conferences, publications, recognition and UNESCO ==

This historian has presented the results of her research at numerous conferences and has published widely. Her most complete publication is: S. Huxley [Barkham], ed., ''Los vascos en el marco Atlántico Norte. Siglos XVI y XVII [The Basques in the North Atlantic in the 16th and 17th Centuries]'' (San Sebastián: Etor Editorial, 1987). Her work has featured extensively in the media, magazines, books and documentaries. In July 1985 it was, together with the archaeology at Red Bay, cover article of ''National Geographic magazine''.  
 
She has received a number of national and international honours and awards. The press release notifying her appointment to the Order of Canada (1981) refers to the fact that, besides her discoveries in Labrador, she "uncovered a period (1540-1600) in Canadian history about which almost nothing was known". In 1993, Memorial University of Newfoundland awarded her an Honorary Doctorate for having "sparked a wholesale revision of 16th-century Canadian history". In 2009, she was elected Fellow of the international organization Wings WorldQuest, which "recognizes and supports visionary women who are advancing scientific inquiry and environmental conservation".  
 
In June 2013, the Red Bay National Historic Site was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This declaration reflects the importance of the contribution made by Barkham to the history of the Basque Country and of Canada.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

== Awards and honours ==

*In 1980 Barkham was awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]] - the first woman so honoured - for “a classic piece of historical-geographical research”. The editorial in the Society’s magazine Canadian Geographic announcing the award states: “While her work is continuing [...] she already has done much to fill a great gap in our history from the time of Cartier and Roberval [...] to the arrival of Champlain early in the 1600s. [...] The Gold Medal is an occasional award, not an annual one, intended to recognize a particular achievement by one or more individuals in the general field of geography, also to provide an opportunity from time to time to recognize a significant national or international event. In Selma Barkham’s case, the Society felt that she deserved this recognition on both counts.” (Canadian Geographic, 100 (#3), 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;58.)
*In 1981 appointed Member of the [[Order of Canada]] (awarded December 1981, conferred April 1982). The citation refers, among other things, to the facts that she “uncovered a period (1540-1600) in Canadian history about which almost nothing was known” and that “she discovered the presence of 400 year old Basque settlements [and sunken galleons] in Labrador”. It ends with the statement: “Selma Barkham has made one of the most outstanding contributions, in recent years, to the story of this nation.”
*In 1981 elected Member of the [[Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del País|Real Sociedad Bascongada de los Amigos del País]] (The Royal Society of Friends of the Basque Country).
*In 1985 awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the [[University of Windsor]] (Canada).
*In 1992 nominated Honorary Consul of Bilbao by the [http://www.camarabilbao.com/ccb/portal.portal.action Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation of Bilbao] (the Basque Country, Spain). She is the only woman to be so nominated thus far.
*In 1993 awarded an Honorary Doctorate by [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] (Canada). The oration read on that occasion by the University orator refers to Barkham’s “re-discovery of the Basque element [which] has sparked a wholesale revision of 16th-century Canadian history.” (Memorial University of Newfoundland Gazette, June 3, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;7.)
*In 1999 received the [http://www.sabinoarana.org/?sesion=1&amp;portada=no Sabino Arana Foundation] (Bilbao, the Basque Country, Spain) 1998 Prize for Culture.
*In 1999 the City of [[St. John’s, Newfoundland]], named one of the city’s streets after her stating: “Barkham’s rediscovery of the Basque presence has been recognized as one of the single most significant additions to the knowledge of early history of Newfoundland”.
*In 2000 the Town of Red Bay, Labrador, named its Town Centre after her.
*In 2002 awarded the Government of  Canada’s [[Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal]], granted to “Canadians who have made outstanding and exemplary contributions to their communities or to Canada as a whole”.
*In 2008 a statement was read in the House of Assembly of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador commemorating the 30th anniversary (1977-2007) of Barkham’s discovery of the 16th-century Basque whaling site in Red Bay, Labrador, which has given that port international recognition. This anniversary was celebrated in Red Bay with a ceremony in the historian’s honour.
*In 2009 elected Fellow of [http://www.wingsworldquest.org/ Wings WorldQuest], an international organization which “recognizes and supports visionary women who are advancing scientific inquiry and environmental conservation and shares their knowledge with the world.” Her election was mainly in recognition of her discovery of thousands of 16th-century manuscripts in Spanish and Basque archives, and of 16th-century Basque whaling sites on the south coast of Labrador.
*In 2010 received, among other individuals and entities, a tribute from the Association of Basque Schools of Bizkaia (Asociación de Ikastolas de Bizkaia) (Ibilaldia 2010) for her work “helping and promoting Basque language and culture” in subjects related to the sea.
*In 2012 elected Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of History and Fine Arts of Burgos (Spain).
*In 2012 awarded the Government of Canada’s [[Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal]].
*In 2013 received the Gold Medal of the Oceanographical Society of Gipuzkoa/[http://www.aquariumss.com/en/menu,information/ Aquarium] (San Sebastián, the Basque Country) (an occasional award) “in recognition of her pioneering research and discoveries”.
*In 2014 received the prize Lagun Onari from the Basque Government.

'''''Shanghai Lalas: Female Tongzhi Communities and Politics in Urban China''''' is a 2012 book written by Lucetta Kam Yip-lo ({{zh|t=金曄路|j=gam1 jip6 lou6|p=Jīn Yèlù|first=j}}&lt;ref&gt;"[http://balcs.hkbu.edu.hk/staff.php?staff_class=ts&amp;staff_id=12 Dr. KAM Yip Lo, Lucetta | 金曄路博士]." [[Hong Kong Baptist University]]. Retrieved on 26 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) and published by the [[Hong Kong University Press]]. It is Volume 1 of the Queer Asia series.

The book discusses ''lalas'' ({{zh|c=拉拉|p=lālā}}), including female bisexuals, lesbians, and trans women, in Shanghai. From 2005 to 2011, as part of her research, Lucetta Kam interviewed 25 ''lalas''. Most of the women were in their 20s and originated from urban areas.&lt;ref name=ChiuJoanna&gt;Chiu, Joanna. "[http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/books/article/1150889/book-review-shanghai-lalas-lucetta-kam-yip-lo Book review: Shanghai Lalas, by Lucetta Kam Yip-lo]." ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Sunday, 17 February 2013. Updated Monday, 18 February 2013. Retrieved on 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanghai-born Lucetta Kam is an assistant professor at [[Hong Kong Baptist University]] (HKBU), and she is involved in LGBT organizations in Hong Kong, where she was raised. Lucetta Kam herself is a lesbian, and Joanna Chiu of the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' wrote that Lucetta Kam "needed to work to maintain her distance from her subjects".&lt;ref name=ChiuJoanna/&gt;

==Reception==
Joanna Chiu wrote that the book was "a balanced, richly insightful and succinctly argued study" that "reveals as many truths about the lives of urban lalas as about the shifting forms of social control - and strategies of social transformation - in Chinese society today."&lt;ref name=ChiuJoanna/&gt;

'''''The Indian Story of an Author''''' is a creative nonfiction book written by [[Gaurav Sharma (author)|Gaurav Sharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The Indian Story of an Author': A Symbolic Protest|url=http://www.uniindia.com/news/india/-the-indian-story-of-an-author-a-symbolic-protest/1282646.html|newspaper=United News of India|date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My experiments with the truth of publishing, Gaurav Sharma's new book|url=http://epaper.newindianexpress.com/c/31145964|newspaper=The New Indian Express|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

The first edition of ''The Indian Story of an Author'' was published in July 2018 by Think Tank Books. 

==Synopsis==

The book was created out of the frustration of the author when he pitched one of his manuscripts (''[[God of the Sullied]]'') to the publishers in India only to face their rejections on unclear grounds. It only has one brief chapter that summarises the irony of getting published in India with manuscripts other than romance and chick-lit genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rejection the reason behind me creating my new book, says Gaurav Sharma|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/books-and-art/040818/rejection-is-the-reason-behind-creating-my-new-book-says-gaurav-sharm.html|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is intentionally left blank to express the exasperation of its author on behalf of all other aspiring writers. Sharma's 100 pager book is blank after 13 printed pages, connoting similar trend as seen during the [[The Emergency (India)|Indian emergency]] declared by the then prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]] when many journalists including [[Ramnath Goenka]] left the editorial page of their respective newspapers blank, protesting against the censorship imposed on the press during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=द इंडियन स्टोरी ऑफ ऐन ऑथर: प्रतिरोध का मौन हथियार|url=https://www.outlookhindi.com/art-and-culture/review/the-indian-story-of-an-author-silence-weapon-of-resistance-29657|newspaper=Outlook|date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Story of an Author was well received in the media and is seen as a symbolic message from the author to all the aspiring writers about the complications of Indian publishing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My experiments with the truth of publishing, Gaurav Sharma's new book|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/jul/31/my-experiments-with-the-truth-of-publishing-gaurav-sharmas-new-book-1850861.html|newspaper=The New Indian Express|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Václav Smil''' (born 9 December 1943) is a [[Czech Canadians|Czech-Canadian]] scientist and policy analyst.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vaclavsmil.com/ Official Site of Vaclav Smil&lt;/ref&gt; He is [[Distinguished Professor]] Emeritus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/environment/departments/geography/staff/486.htm University of Manitoba: Faculty of Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Faculty of [[Environmental science|Environment]] at the [[University of Manitoba]] in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada.  His interdisciplinary research interests encompass a broad area of energy, environmental, food, [[population]], economic, historical and [[public policy]] studies, and he had also applied these approaches to energy, food and [[Environmental governance in China|environmental affairs of China]]. His name is pronounced as "vah:tslahf" and "smeel".{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Background==
Smil was born during [[World War II|WWII]] in [[Plzeň]], at that time in the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] (present-day [[Czech Republic]]).&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; His father was a police officer and his mother a book keeper.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; Growing up in a remote mountain town in the [[Plzeň Region]], Smil cut wood daily to keep the home heated providing an early lesson in energy efficiency and density.&lt;ref name=sciencemag&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1320.full |title=The Realist |work=[[Science Magazine]] |author=Paul Voosen |date=March 23, 2018 |accessdate=March 24, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322234243/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1320.full |archivedate=2018-03-22 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Smil completed his undergraduate studies at the Faculty of Natural Sciences of [[Charles University]] in Prague, where he took 35 classes a week, 10 months a year, for 5 years.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; "They taught me nature, from geology to clouds," Smil said.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; After graduation he refused to join the Communist party, undermining his job prospects, though he found employment at a regional planning office.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; He married Eva who was studying to be a physician.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; In 1969, following the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]], and Eva's graduation, the Smils emigrated to the USA, leaving the country months before a Soviet travel ban shut the borders.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; "That was not a minor sacrifice, you know?" Smil says.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; Over the next two years, Smil completed a doctorate in Geography at the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences of the [[Pennsylvania State University]].&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt;&lt;ref name=bryce&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robertbryce.com/articles/351-an-interview-with-vaclav-smil |title=An Interview with Vaclav Smil |publisher=Robert Bryce website |author=Robert Bryce |date=July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216200053/http://www.robertbryce.com/articles/351-an-interview-with-vaclav-smil |archivedate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he took his first job offer at the [[University of Manitoba]] where he remained for decades, until his retirement.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; He taught introductory environmental science courses among other subjects dealing with energy, atmospheric change, China, population and economic development.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt;

Included among Smil's admirers is Microsoft co-founder [[Bill Gates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Ritchie|title=Meet Vaclav Smil, the Canadian polymath whose books Bill Gates is racing to read|url=https://qz.com/113086/meet-vaclav-smil-the-canadian-polymath-whose-books-bill-gates-is-racing-to-read/|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=August 8, 2013|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has read all of Smil's 36 books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennet|first=James|title=‘We Need an Energy Miracle’|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/11/we-need-an-energy-miracle/407881/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=November 2015|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I wait for new Smil books the way some people wait for the next Star Wars movie," Gates wrote in 2017.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; "I'll forever be Bill Gates's scientist," Smil ruefully said.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt;

Smil is known for being "intensely private", shunning the press while letting his books speak for themselves.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; At UM, he only ever showed up at one faculty meeting (since the 1980s). The school accepted his reclusiveness so long as he kept teaching and publishing  highly-rated books.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt;  

His wife Eva is a physician&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; and his son David is an organic synthetic chemist.

==Position on energy==
Smil is sceptical that there will be a rapid transition to clean energy, believing it will take much longer than many predict.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; Smil said "I have never been wrong on these major energy and environmental issues because I have nothing to sell," unlike many energy companies and politicians.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; "He's a slayer of bullshit," says [[David Keith (scientist)|David Keith]], an energy and climate scientist at Harvard University.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; 

Smil notes that as of 2018, coal, oil, and natural gas still supply 90% of the world's primary energy. Despite decades of growth of renewable energy, the world uses more fossil fuels in 2018 than in 2000, by percentage.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
He is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] (Science Academy)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.ca/submitallsearch.php?pageNum_rsResults=33&amp;totalRows_rsResults=1961 |title=All Fellows: Records 1651 to 1700 |publisher=[[Royal Society of Canada]] |author= |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224102721/http://www.rsc.ca/submitallsearch.php?pageNum_rsResults=33&amp;totalRows_rsResults=1961 |archivedate=2012-02-24 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recipient of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/public/public_winners.shtml |title=AAAS Public Engagement with Science Award Recipients |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |author= |date= |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he was named by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine to its list of [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers]].&lt;ref name=fp&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,35 |title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers: 49.

He has been an invited speaker in more than 300 conferences and workshops in the USA, Canada, Europe, Asia and Africa, has lectured at many universities in [[North America]], Europe and [[East Asia]] and has worked as a consultant for many US, [[European Union]] and [[international institution]]s.

'''Vlasina''' is a mountainous [[regions of Serbia|region]] of southeastern [[Serbia]]. It is a border area to [[Bulgaria]], a region of the [[Rhodopes|Rhodopian]] Serbia, with old rocks and mountains. Its most prominent landforms are eponymous [[Vlasina River]] and [[Vlasina Lake]]. It corresponds to the territories of municipalities of [[Crna Trava]], [[Vlasotince]] and [[Surdulica]].

The region consists of fours smaller, micro-regions: [[Crna Trava]], [[Znepolje]], Lužnica and [[Vlasotince]]. Near Vlasotince, remains of the ancient [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions are quite visible.

== Economy ==

The largest center of the whole region is the town of [[Vlasotince]], but in general, the area is one of the least developed in Serbia, very poor and extremely depopulating. For example, population of Crna Trava municipality decreased from around 14,000 in 1953 to mere 2,500 in 2002. Accordingly, density also plunged, from 43 per km² in 1953 to only 8 per km² in 2002.

A circular freeway connects the valleys of the Vlasina and Južna Morava rivers.

In 2005 Hellenic Bottling Co., a subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company, bought the local water factory ("Rosa" is a trademark for this water) which is located close to the Vlasina source thus causing potests of the local environmentalists. Activists from the "Eco base South" (Eko baza Jug) were afraid of [[overexploitation]] drying out the sources of the river.

== Wildlife ==

In 2018 it was announced that [[European free-tailed bat]], previously unrecorded in Serbia, was discovered living in Vlasina region. It is a 31st species of bat which inhabits the country and the one with the largest wingspan.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | author = Ana Vuković | title = Sredozemni repaš nađen i u Srbiji | trans-title = European free-tailed bat discovered in Serbia | newspaper = Politika | page = 12 | language = Serbian | date = 3 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waldo Rudolph Tobler''' (November 16, 1930&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aTMjAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Waldo+R.+Tobler+1930&amp;dq=Waldo+R.+Tobler+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJvPW66N_ZAhUFCewKHSsGCsIQ6AEIOTAE]&lt;/ref&gt; – February 20, 2018)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aag.org/cs/membership/tributes_memorials/sz/tobler_waldo Waldo R. Tobler]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[geographer]] and [[cartographer]]. Tobler's idea that "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things" &lt;ref&gt;Tobler W. R. (1970) "A Computer Movie Simulating Urban Growth in the Detroit Region", ''Economic Geography'', 46(Supplement): 234-240&lt;/ref&gt; is referred to as the "[[first law of geography]]." He has proposed a second law as well: "The phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside".&lt;ref&gt;Linear pycnophylatic reallocation—Comment on a paper by D. Martin. International Journal of Geographical Information Science 13 (1): 85–90&lt;/ref&gt; Tobler was an active Professor Emeritus at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] Department of Geography until his death.

==Academic background==
In 1961, Tobler received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in the [[Department of Geography, University of Washington|Department of Geography]] at the [[University of Washington]] at Seattle. At Washington, he participated in geography's [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]]-led quantitative revolution of the late 1950s. After graduating, Tobler spent several years at the [[University of Michigan]]. Until his retirement he held the positions of Professor of Geography and Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The [[University of Zurich]], Switzerland, awarded him an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in 1988.

==Research==
Tobler was one of the [[principal investigator]]s and a senior [[scientist]] in the [[National Science Foundation]]-sponsored [[National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis]]. He has used computers in geographic research since the 1960s, with emphasis on mathematical modeling and graphic interpretations. Well known for his publications, he formulated the "[[first law of geography]]" in 1970 while producing a computer movie, and is the inventor of novel and unusual [[map projection]]s, among which was the first derivation of the partial differential equations for area cartograms. He also invented a method for smooth two-dimensional mass-preserving areal data redistribution. In 1989, the [[American Geographical Society]] awarded Tobler with the [[Osborn Maitland Miller Medal]].&lt;ref name=honorslist&gt;[http://www.amergeog.org/honorslist.pdf "The Cullum Geographical Medal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704200812/http://www.amergeog.org/honorslist.pdf |date=2009-07-04 }}. American Geographical Society. Retrieved June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobler has been involved recently in building a global, [[latitude]]-[[longitude]] oriented, demographic information base with resolution two orders of magnitude better than was previously available. He also had been examining the development of smooth finite element and categorical pycnophylactic geographic information reallocation models. In July 1999 he presented a [[keynote]] speech, "The World is Shriveling as it Shrinks," at the [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] International User Conference, and was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award in [[Geographic information system|GIS]] by ESRI. [[Taylor and Francis]] of London recently published a [[map projection]] book, co-authored with Q. Yang of [[China]] and the late [[John P. Snyder]]. Current interests relate to ideas in computational [[geography]] including the analysis of geographical [[vector (geometric)|vector]] fields and the development of migration and of global [[trade]] models.

Tobler has also been concerned with the representing flow (due to its involvement with movement as a mechanism of geographic change). In 2003, Tobler released a [[freeware]], [[Microsoft Windows]]-based version of his flow representation software Flow Mapper. In 2005, an ESRI ArcGIS version of the software, inspired by Tobler, was developed by [[John Alan Glennon|Alan Glennon]] and [[Michael Frank Goodchild|Michael Goodchild]] at UCSB. Both versions are available from the Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science (http://csiss.org/clearinghouse/FlowMapper/)

Tobler served on the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] the Board on Earth Sciences. He has been on the editorial board of several journals, including ''[[The American Cartographer]]'', ''[[Journal of Regional Science]]'', ''[[Geographical Analysis (journal)|Geographical Analysis]]'', and the ''[[International Journal of Geographical Information Systems]]''. He was a charter member of the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association, a council member of the Regional Science Association, member and chairman of the Mathematical Social Science Board, and served as the United States delegate to the [[International Geographical Union]] Commission on Geographical Data Processing and Sensing. Until his retirement, he was a member of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] of Great Britain.

'''Zikirti''' or '''Zikirtu''', (also: ''Zikirta'', ''Zikurti'', ''Zekertu'') was an ancient kingdom (750-521 BC), in northern [[Zagros]], which comprised the easternmost part of ''Greater [[Mannae]]''. Geographically it corresponds with the modern counties of [[Takab]] and [[Shahindej]] in northwestern [[Iran]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The people of Zikirti are possibly to be identified with ancient [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Sagartians]], mentioned by [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/asagarta-sagartia-asagartiya-sagartian-old-persian-elamite-as-s-kar-ti-ia-babylonian-kursa-ga-ar-ta-a-a-greek-s Iranica Online, "Asargarta"]&lt;/ref&gt;
