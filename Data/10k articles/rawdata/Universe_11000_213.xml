'''Aggregated diamond nanorods''', or '''ADNRs''', are a [[nanocrystalline]] form of [[diamond]], also known as '''nanodiamond''' or '''hyperdiamond'''.

== Discovery ==

Nanodiamond or hyperdiamond was convincingly demonstrated to be produced by compression of [[graphite]] in 2003 and in the same work found to be much harder than bulk diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Irifune |first1=Tetsuo |last2=Kurio |first2=Ayako |last3=Sakamoto |first3=Shizue|last4=Inoue |first4=Toru |last5=Sumiya |first5=Hitoshi |title=Materials: Ultrahard polycrystalline diamond from graphite |journal=Nature |volume=421 |pages=599–600 |year=2003 |doi=10.1038/421599b |pmid=12571587 |issue=6923|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..599I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was also produced by compression of [[fullerene]] and confirmed to be the hardest and least compressible known material, with an [[isothermal bulk modulus]] of 491 [[pascal (unit)|gigapascals]] (GPa), while a conventional diamond has a modulus of 442–446 GPa; these results were inferred from [[X-ray diffraction]] data, which also indicated that ADNRs are 0.3% denser than regular diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dubrovinskaia |first1=Natalia |last2=Dubrovinsky |first2=Leonid |last3=Crichton |first3=Wilson |last4=Langenhorst |first4=Falko |last5=Richter |first5=Asta |title=Aggregated diamond nanorods, the densest and least compressible form of carbon |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=87 |issue=8 |pages=083106 |year=2005 |doi=10.1063/1.2034101 |bibcode=2005ApPhL..87h3106D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same group later described ADNRs as "having a hardness and [[Young's modulus]] comparable to that of natural diamond, but with 'superior wear resistance'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dubrovinskaia |first1=Natalia |last2=Dub |first2=Sergey |last3=Dubrovinsky |first3=Leonid |title=Superior Wear Resistance of Aggregated Diamond Nanorods |journal=Nano Letters |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=824 |year=2006 |doi=10.1021/nl0602084|pmid=16608291 |bibcode = 2006NanoL...6..824D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardness ==
A [[Miller index|&amp;lt;111&amp;gt;]] surface (normal to the largest diagonal of a cube) of pure diamond has a hardness value of 167±6 GPa when scratched with a nanodiamond tip, while the nanodiamond sample itself has a value of 310 GPa when tested with a nanodiamond tip.&lt;ref name=blank&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blank |first1=V |title=Ultrahard and superhard phases of fullerite C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;: Comparison with diamond on hardness and wear |url=http://nanoscan.info/wp-content/publications/article_03.pdf |journal=Diamond and Related Materials |volume=7 |issue=2–5 |pages=427 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(97)00232-X |bibcode=1998DRM.....7..427B |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225258/http://nanoscan.info/wp-content/publications/article_03.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the test only works properly with a tip made of harder material than the sample being tested. This means that the true value for nanodiamond is likely somewhat lower than 310 GPa.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== Synthesis ==
ADNRs (hyper diamonds / nano diamonds) are produced by compressing fullerite powder—a solid form of [[allotropy|allotropic]] carbon fullerene—by any of two somewhat similar methods. One uses a [[diamond anvil cell]] and applied pressure ~37 GPa without heating the cell.&lt;ref name=blank2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blank |first1=V |last2=Popov |first2=M |last3=Buga |first3=S |last4=Davydov |first4=V |last5=Denisov |first5=V |last6=Ivlev |first6=A |last7=Marvin |first7=B |last8=Agafonov |first8=V |last9=Ceolin |first9=R |displayauthors=8|title=Is C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerite harder than diamond? |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=188 |issue=3 |pages=281 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0375-9601(94)90451-0|bibcode = 1994PhLA..188..281B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another method, fullerite is compressed to lower pressures (2–20 GPa) and then heated to a temperature in the range of {{convert|300|to|2500|K|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kozlov |first1=M |title=Superhard form of carbon obtained from C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; at moderate pressure |journal=Synthetic Metals |volume=70 |pages=1411 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/0379-6779(94)02900-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blank |first1=V |title=Ultrahard and superhard carbon phases produced from C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; by heating at high pressure: structural and Raman studies |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=205 |issue=2–3 |pages=208 |year=1995|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(95)00564-J|bibcode = 1995PhLA..205..208B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szwarc |first1=H |last2=Davydov |first2=V |last3=Plotianskaya |first3=S |last4=Kashevarova |first4=L |last5=Agafonov |first5=V |last6=Ceolin |first6=R |title=Chemical modifications of C under the influence of pressure and temperature: from cubic C to diamond |journal=Synthetic Metals |volume=77 |pages=265 |year=1996 |doi=10.1016/0379-6779(96)80100-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blank |first1=V |title=Phase transformations in solid C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; at high-pressure-high-temperature treatment and the structure of 3D polymerized fullerites |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=220 |pages=149 |year=1996 |doi=10.1016/0375-9601(96)00483-5|bibcode = 1996PhLA..220..149B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme hardness of what now appears likely to have been nanodiamonds was reported by researchers in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=blank/&gt;&lt;ref name=blank2/&gt; The material is a series of interconnected diamond nanorods, with diameters of between 5 and 20 [[nanometre]]s and lengths of around 1 [[micrometre]] each.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

[[Image:flow bench schematic.GIF|frame|right|Typical Flow Bench schematic]]
An '''air flow bench''' is a device used for testing the internal [[aerodynamic]] qualities of an [[engine]] component and is related to the more familiar [[wind tunnel]].

It is used primarily for testing the intake and exhaust ports of [[cylinder head]]s of [[internal combustion engine]]s. It is also used to test the flow capabilities of any component such as air filters, carburetors, manifolds or any other part that is required to flow gas. A flow bench is one of the primary tools of high performance engine builders, and [[cylinder head porting|porting]] cylinder heads would be strictly hit or miss without it.

A flow bench consists of an air pump of some sort, a [[Flow measurement|metering element]], pressure and temperature measuring instruments such as [[manometer]]s, and various controls. The test piece is attached in series with the pump and measuring element and air is pumped through the whole system. Therefore, all the air passing through the metering element also passes through the test piece. Because the volume flow rate through the metering element is known and the flow through the test piece is the same, it is also known. The mass flow rate can be calculated using the known pressure and temperature data to calculate air densities, and multiplying by the volume flow rate.

==Air pump==
The [[air pump]] used must be able to deliver the volume required at the pressure required. Most flow testing is done at 10 and 28&amp;nbsp;inches of water pressure (2.5 to 7 [[kilopascal]]s). Although other test pressures will work, the results would have to be converted for comparison to the work of others. The pressure developed must account for the test pressure plus the loss across the metering element plus all other system losses. The greater the accuracy of the metering element the greater is the loss. Flow volume of between 100 and 600 [[cubic feet per minute]] (0.05 to 0.28 [[m³/s]]) would serve almost all applications depending on the size of the engine under test.

Any type of pump that can deliver the required pressure difference and flow volume can be used. Most often used is the dynamic-compression [[Centrifugal compressor|centrifugal]] type compressor, which is familiar to most as being used in vacuum cleaners and [[turbocharger]]s, but multistaged [[Axial compressor|axial-flow compressor]] types, similar to those used in most [[jet engines]], could work as well, although there would be little need for the added cost and complexities involved, as they typically don't require such a high flow rate as a jet engine, nor are they limited by the aerodynamic drag considerations which makes a narrow-diameter axial compressor more effective in jet engines than a centrifugal compressor of equal air flow. Positive displacement types such as [[Reciprocating compressor|piston compressors]], or rotary types such as a [[Roots-type supercharger|Roots blower]] could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as [[Rotary screw compressor|twin screw]] compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single fan blade is too low and cannot be used.

==Metering element==
There are several possible types of metering element in use. Flow benches ordinarily use one of three types: [[orifice plate]], [[Venturi effect|venturi meter]] and [[Pitot tube|pitot/static]] tube, all of which deliver similar accuracy. Most commercial machines use orifice plates due to their simple construction and the ease of providing multiple flow ranges. Although the venturi offers substantial improvements in efficiency, its cost is higher.

==Instrumentation==
Air flow conditions must be measured at two locations, across the test piece and across the metering element. The pressure difference across the test piece allows the standardization of tests from one to another. The pressure across the metering element allows calculation of the actual flow through the whole system.

The pressure across the test piece is typically measured with a [[Oscillating U-tube|U tube]] [[manometer]] while, for increased sensitivity and accuracy, the pressure difference across the metering element is measured with an inclined manometer. One end of each manometer is connected to its respective plenum chamber while the other is open to the atmosphere.

Ordinarily all flow bench manometers measure in inches of water although the inclined manometer's scale is usually replaced with a [[logarithmic scale]] reading in percentage of total flow of the selected metering element which makes flow calculation simpler.

Temperature must also be accounted for because the air pump will heat the air passing through it making the air down stream of it less dense and more viscous. This difference must be corrected for. Temperature is measured at the test piece plenum and at the metering element plenum. Correction factors are then applied during flow calculations. Some flow bench designs place the air pump after the metering element so that heating by the air pump is not as large a concern.

Additional manometers can be installed for use with hand held probes, which are used to explore local flow conditions in the port.

==Flow bench data==
The air flow bench can give a wealth of data about the characteristics of a [[cylinder head]] or whatever part is tested. The result of main interest is bulk flow. It is the volume of air that flows through the port in a given time. Expressed in cubic feet per minute or cubic meters per second/minute.

[[Poppet valve|Valve lift]] can be expressed as an actual dimension in decimal inches or mm. It can also be specified as a ratio between a characteristic diameter and the lift ''L''/''D''. Most often used is the valve head diameter. Normally engines have an ''L''/''D'' ratio from 0 up to a maximum of .35. For example, a {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} valve would be lifted a maximum of 0.350&amp;nbsp;inch. During flow testing the valve would be set at ''L''/''D'' .05 .1 .15 .2 .25 .3 and readings taken successively. This allows the comparison of efficiencies of ports with other valve sizes, as the valve lift is proportional rather than absolute. For comparison with tests by others the characteristic diameter used to determine lift must be the same.

Flow coefficients are determined by comparing the actual flow of a test piece to the theoretical flow of a perfect [[:wikt:orifice|orifice]] of equal area. Thus the flow coefficient should be a close measure of efficiency. It cannot be exact because the ''L''/''D'' does not indicate the actual minimum size of the duct.

[[Image:Orfice plate.GIF|frame|left|A real orifice plate showing how the fluid would actually flow]]
[[Image:Perfect orifice.JPG|frame|rightxx|A theoretical orifice plate showing perfect flow which is used as a standard for comparing the efficiencies of real flows]]

An orifice with a flow coefficient of .59 would flow the same amount of fluid as a perfect orifice with 59% of its area or 59% of the flow of a perfect orifice with the same area (orifice plates of the type shown would have a coefficient of between .58 and .62 depending on the precise details of construction and the surrounding installation).&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics 4th Ed Munson Young -Wiley P514-515&lt;/ref&gt;

Valve/port coefficient is non dimensional and is derived by multiplying a characteristic physical area of the port and by the bulk flow figures and comparing the result to an ideal orifice of the same area. It is here that air flow bench norms differ from fluid dynamics or aerodynamics at large. The coefficient may be based on the inner valve seat diameter, the outer valve head diameter, the port throat area or the valve open curtain area. Each of these methods are valid for some purpose but none of them represents the true minimum area for the valve/port in question and each results in a different flow coefficient. The great difficulty of measuring the actual minimum area at all the various valve lifts precludes using this as a characteristic measurement. This is due to the minimum area changing shape and location throughout the lift cycle. Because of this non standardization, port flow coefficients are not "true" flow coefficients, which would be based on the actual minimum area in the flow path. Which method to choose depends on what use is intended for the data. Engine simulation applications each require their own specification. If the result is to be compared to the work of others then the same method would have to be selected.

[[Image:Valve flow coefficient .GIF|frame|left|Various characteristic measurements used to determine flow coefficients]]
Using extra instrumentation (manometers and probes) the detailed flow through the port can be mapped by measuring multiple points within the port with probes. Using these tools, the velocity profile throughout the port can be mapped which gives insight into what the port is doing and what might be done to improve it.

Of less interest is mass flow per minute or second since the test is not of a running engine which would be affected by it. It is the weight of air that flows through the port in a given time. Expressed in pounds per minute/hour or kilograms per second/minute. Mass flow is derived from the volume flow result to which a density correction is applied.

With the information gathered on the flow bench, engine power curve and system dynamics can be roughly estimated by applying various formulae. With the advent of accurate engine simulation software, however, it is much more useful to use flow data to create an engine model for a simulator.

Determining air velocity is a useful part of flow testing. It is calculated as follows:

'''For one set of English units'''
:&lt;math&gt;V=1096.7 \sqrt{H/d}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:''V'' = Velocity in feet per minute
:''H'' = Pressure drop across test piece in inches of water measured by the test pressure manometer
:''d'' = density of air in pounds per cubic foot (''0.075 pound per cubic foot at standard conditions'')&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer Air Velocity Instruments manual&lt;/ref&gt;

'''For [[SI]] units'''
:&lt;math&gt;V= \sqrt{[2*H]/d}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:''V'' = Velocity in meters per second
:''H'' = Pressure drop across test piece in pascals measured by the test pressure manometer
:''d'' = density of air in kilograms per cubic meter (''1.20 kilograms per cubic meter at standard conditions'')

This represents the highest speed of the air in the flow path, at or near the section of minimum area (''through the valve seat at low values of L/D for instance'').

Once velocity has been calculated, the volume can be calculated by multiplying the velocity by the orifice area times its flow coefficient.

==Limitations==
A flow bench is capable of giving flow data which is closely but not perfectly related to actual engine performance. There are a number of limiting factors which contribute to the discrepancy.

===Steady state flow vs dynamic flow===
A flow bench tests ports under a steady pressure difference while in the actual engine the pressure difference varies widely during the whole cycle. The exact flow conditions existing in the flow bench test exist only fleetingly if at all in an actual running engine. Running engines cause the air to flow in strong waves rather than the steady stream of the flow bench. This acceleration/deceleration of the fuel/air column causes effects not accounted for in flow bench tests.

[[Image:Test pressure graph.GIF|frame|100px|left|Comparison of flow bench test pressure to actual engine pressures predicted by an engine simulation program]]
This graph, generated with an engine simulation program, shows how widely the pressures vary in a running engine vs. the steady test pressure of the flow bench.

('''Note''', on the graph, that, in this case, when the intake valve opens, the cylinder pressure is above atmospheric (nearly 50% above or 1.5 bar or 150 kPa). This will cause '''''reverse''''' flow into the intake port until pressure in the cylinder falls below the ports pressure).

===Pressure differential===
The coefficient of the port '''''may''''' change somewhat at different pressure differentials due to changes in [[Reynolds number]] regime leading to a possible loss of [[dynamic similitude]].
Flow bench test pressure are typically conducted at 10 to 28&amp;nbsp;inches of water (2.5 to 7 kPa) while a real engine may see 190&amp;nbsp;inches of water (47 kPa) pressure difference.

===Air only vs mixed gas/fuel mist flow===
The flow bench tests using only air while a real engine usually uses air mixed with fuel droplets and fuel vapor, which is significantly different. Evaporating fuel passing through the port-runner has the effect of adding gas to and lowering the temperature of the air stream along the runner and giving the outlet flow rate slightly higher than the flow rate entering the port-runner. A port which flows dry air well might cause fuel droplets to fall out of suspension causing a loss of power not indicated by flow figures alone.

===Bulk flow vs flow velocity===
Large ports and valves can show high flow rates on a flow bench but the velocity can be lowered to the point that the gas dynamics of a real engine are ruined. Overly large ports also contribute to fuel fall out.

===Even room temperature vs. uneven high temperature===
A running engine is much hotter than room temperature and the temperature in various parts of the system vary widely. This affects the actual flow, fuel effects as well as the dynamic wave effects in the engine which do not exist on the flow bench.

===Physical and mechanical differences===
The proximity, shape and movement of the piston as well as the movement of the valve itself significantly alters the flow conditions in a real engine that do not exist in flow bench tests.

===Exhaust port conditions===
The flow simulated on a flow bench bears almost no similarity to the flow in a real exhaust port. Here even the coefficients measured on flow benches are inaccurate. This is due to the very high and wide-ranging pressures and temperatures. From the graph above it can be seen that the pressure in the port reaches 2.5 [[bar (unit)|bar]] (250 [[kPa]]) and the cylinder pressure at opening is 6 bar (600 kPa) and more. This is many times more than the capabilities of a typical flow bench of 0.06 bar (6 kPa).

The flow in a real exhaust port can easily be sonic with choked flow occurring and even supersonic flow in areas. The very high temperature causes the viscosity of the gas to increase, all of which alters the Reynolds number drastically.

Added to the above is the profound effect that downstream elements have on the flow of the exhaust port. Far more than upstream elements found on the intake side.

Exhaust port size and flow information might be considered as vague, but there are certain guidelines which are used when creating a base-line to optimum performance. This base line, of course, is further tuned and qualified through a [[dynamometer]].

The '''Athabasca oil sands''' (or '''tar sands''') are large deposits of [[bitumen]] or extremely [[heavy crude oil]], located in northeastern [[Alberta]], Canada – roughly centred on the [[boomtown]] of [[Fort McMurray]]. These [[oil sands]], hosted primarily in the [[McMurray Formation]], consist of a mixture of crude bitumen (a semi-solid rock-like form of crude oil), silica sand, clay minerals, and water. The Athabasca deposit is the largest known reservoir of crude bitumen in the world and the largest of three major oil sands deposits in Alberta, along with the nearby [[Peace River oil sands|Peace River]] and [[Cold Lake oil sands|Cold Lake deposits]] (the latter stretching into [[Saskatchewan]]).&lt;ref name="The Oil Sands of Alberta"&gt;Mather, Clive {{YouTube|86NG0j0wi1s|"The Oil Sands of Alberta"}}, ''Canada Broadcasting Corporation''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, these oil sand deposits lie under {{convert|141000|km2|sqmi}} of [[boreal forest]] and [[muskeg]] (peat [[bogs]]) and contain about {{convert|1.7|Toilbbl|e9m3}} of bitumen in-place, comparable in magnitude to the world's total proven reserves of conventional [[petroleum]]. The [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) lists the economically recoverable reserves, at 2007 prices and modern unconventional oil production technology, to be {{convert|178|Goilbbl|e9m3}}, or about 10% of these deposits.&lt;ref name="The Oil Sands of Alberta" /&gt;  These contribute to Canada's total [[proven reserves]] being the third largest in the world, after [[Saudi Arabia]] and Venezuela's [[Orinoco Belt]].&lt;ref name="albertasoilsands2006"&gt;{{cite web | title = Alberta's Oil Sands 2006 | publisher = Government of Alberta | year = 2007

By 2009, the two extraction methods used were ''[[in situ]]'' extraction, when the bitumen occurs deeper within the ground, (which will account for 80 percent of oil sands development) and surface or open-pit mining, when the bitumen is closer to the surface. Only 20 percent of bitumen can be extracted using open pit mining methods,&lt;ref name="cenovus_SAGD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cenovus.com/technology/sagd.html|title=Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD)|publisher=Cenovus}}On this site is a Cenovus animation on how SAGD works.&lt;/ref&gt; which involves large scale excavation of the land with huge hydraulic power shovels and [[Caterpillar 797F|400-ton heavy hauler trucks]]. Surface mining leaves toxic tailings ponds. In contrast, ''in situ'' uses more specialized techniques such as [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD). "Eighty percent of the oil sands will be developed ''in situ'' which accounts for 97.5 percent of the total surface area of the oil sands region in Alberta."&lt;ref name=CAPP2009What&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capp.ca/CANADAINDUSTRY/OILSANDS/ENERGY-ECONOMY/Pages/what-are-oilsands.aspx|publisher=CAPP|year=2009|title=What are Oil Sands?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the Athabasca deposit was the only large oil sands [[petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] in the world which was suitable for large-scale [[surface mining]], although most of this reservoir can only be produced using more recently developed [[in-situ#Petroleum production|in-situ]] technology.&lt;ref name="albertasoilsands2006" /&gt;

Critics contend that government and industry measures taken to reduce environmental and health risks posed by large-scale mining operations are inadequate, causing unacceptable damage to the natural environment and human welfare.&lt;ref name="oilsandswatch.org"&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
{{See also|History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)}}
The Athabasca oil sands are named after the [[Athabasca River]] which cuts through the heart of the deposit, and traces of the heavy oil are readily observed on the river banks. [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada, part two|Historically]], the bitumen was used by the indigenous [[Cree]] and [[Dene]] [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]] to waterproof their canoes.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Sir Alexander (1970). "The Journals and Letters of Alexander Mackenzie". Edited by W. Kaye Lamb. Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, p. 129, {{ISBN|0-521-01034-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The oil deposits are located within the boundaries of [[Treaty 8]], and several [[First Nations]] of the area are involved with the sands.

===Early history===
[[File:Alberta tar sands.jpg|thumb|Athabasca oil sands on the banks of the river, around 1900]]

The Athabasca oil sands first came to the attention of European [[fur trade]]rs in 1719 when Wa-pa-su, a Cree trader, brought a sample of bituminous sands to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] post at [[York Factory]] on [[Hudson Bay]] where [[Henry Kelsey]] was the manager. In 1778, [[Peter Pond]], another fur trader and a founder of the rival [[North West Company]], became the first European to see the Athabasca deposits after exploring the [[Methye Portage]] which allowed access to the rich fur resources of the Athabasca River system from the Hudson Bay watershed.&lt;ref name="Hein"&gt;{{cite web

In 1788, fur trader [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], after whom the [[Mackenzie River]] was later named, traveled along routes to both the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]] wrote: "At about {{convert|24|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of {{convert|20|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} long may be inserted without the least resistance. The bitumen is in a fluid state and when mixed with gum, the resinous substance collected from the [[spruce]] fir, it serves to gum the Indians' canoes." He was followed in 1799 by mapmaker [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] and in 1819 by British Naval officer [[John Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[John Richardson (naturalist)|John Richardson]] did the first serious scientific assessment of the oil sands in 1848 on his way north to search for [[Franklin's lost expedition]]. The first government-sponsored survey of the oil sands was initiated in 1875 by [[John Macoun]], and in 1883, G.&amp;nbsp;C. Hoffman of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] tried separating the bitumen from oil sand with the use of water and reported that it separated readily. In 1888, [[Robert Bell (geologist)|Robert Bell]], the director of the Geological Survey of Canada, reported to a Senate Committee that "The evidence … points to the existence in the Athabasca and Mackenzie valleys of the most extensive petroleum field in America, if not the world."&lt;ref name="Hein" /&gt;[[File:Oilsand Drill Cores.jpg|thumb|Athabasca oil sand of the [[McMurray Formation]] as seen in drill cores.]]

Count Alfred von Hammerstein (1870–1941), who arrived in the region in 1897, promoted the Athabaska oil sands for over forty years, taking photos with descriptive titles such as "Tar Sands and Flowing Asphaltum in the Athabasca District," that are now in the National Library and National Archives Canada. Photos of the Athabasca oil sands were also featured in Canadian writer and adventurer, [[Agnes Deans Cameron]]'s, best-selling book {{harv|Cameron|1908|71}}&lt;ref name="Cameron1909"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cameron, Agnes Deans|title=The New North: Being Some Account of a Woman’s Journey through Canada to the Arctic|location=New York|publisher=Appleton|year=1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''The New North: Being Some Account of a Woman’s Journey through Canada to the Arctic'' which recounted her {{convert|10000|mi|km|-3|abbr=on}} roundtrip to the Arctic Ocean. Following this journey and the publication of her book, she travelled extensively as lecturer, with magic lantern slides of her Kodak images, promoting immigration to western Canada at Oxford, Cambridge, St. Andrew’s University and the Royal Geographical Society.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cameron, Agnes Deans (1863–1912)|publisher=ABC Book World|url=http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=2625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her photographs were reproduced in 2011-2012 in an exhibit at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. {{harv|Gismondi|2012|71}}&lt;ref name="GismondiDavidson2012" /&gt; Cameron was particularly enthusiastic about the Athabaska region and the [[Athabaska oil sands]] which included photos of Count Alfred Von Hammerstein's oil drill works along the Athabasca River.

In 1926, [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Karl Clark]] of the University of Alberta received a patent for a hot water separation process which was the forerunner of today's thermal extraction processes. Several attempts to implement it had varying degrees of success.

A pioneer in the discovery and use of natural gas was [[Georg Naumann]]. He used natural gas as early as about 1940.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Project Oilsand===
{{main|Project Oilsand}}
Project Oilsand, also known as Project Oilsands, was a 1958 proposal to exploit the Athabasca oil sands using the underground detonation of [[nuclear explosive]]s;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petroleumhistory.ca/archivesnews/2005/06-jun/phs05-06.pdf Petroleum History Society Archives Newsletter, June 2005], retrieved 2012-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; hypothetically, the heat and pressure created by an underground detonation would boil the [[bitumen]] deposits, reducing their [[viscosity]] to the point that standard [[oilfield]] techniques could be used. The general means by which the plan was to work was discussed in the October 1976 ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4QsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=The+Process+for+Stimulating+Petroliferous+Subterranean+Formations+with+Contained+Nuclear+Explosions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K20shRs4yh&amp;sig=QbaoUXBRIPwawEGJNPWKS7FfKEo&amp;hl=ga&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UFU2VL-FBcbY7Aakk4GgAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Process%20for%20Stimulating%20Petroliferous%20Subterranean%20Formations%20with%20Contained%20Nuclear%20Explosions&amp;f=false October Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists October 1976, p. 23].&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was granted for the process that was intended: ''The Process for Stimulating Petroliferous Subterranean Formations with Contained Nuclear Explosions'' by Bray, Knutson, and Coffer, which was first submitted in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/5467737|title=Process for Stimulating Petroliferous Subterranean Formations with Contained Nuclear Explosions|first1=B.&amp;nbsp;G.|last1=Bray|first2=C.&amp;nbsp;F.|last2=Knutson|first3=H.&amp;nbsp;F.|last3=Coffer|date=5 November 1968|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2016|via=www.osti.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3409082.html Process for stimulating petroliferous subterranean formations with contained nuclear explosions]" (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; With the nuclear heating option considered a forerunner to some of the nascent conventional heating ideas that are presently suggested and in use extracting oil from the Alberta regions Athabasca oil sands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.opednews.com/articles/America-s-Tar-Baby-by-Les-Adler-A-bomb_American-Clean-Energy-And-Security-Act_Antarctic-Ice-Melt_Canada-Ontario-131029-161.html |title= America's Tar Baby |author=Les Adler |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal, originally known as "Project Cauldron", was devised by geologist Manley L. Natland at Los Angeles-based [[Richfield Oil Corporation]]. Natland believed that an underground blast was the most efficient way to generate the heat needed to liquefy the viscous bitumen so that it could be pumped to the surface by conventional wells. The project was conceived of as part of [[Operation Plowshare]], a United States project to harness the nuclear explosions for peaceful applications. However, some experts had doubts. In 1959, oil sands pioneer Robert Fitzsimmons of the International Bitumen Company wrote a letter to the [[Edmonton Journal]], saying ''"While the writer does not know anything about nuclear energy and is therefore not qualified to make any definite statement as to it’s [sic] results he does know something about the effect dry heat has on those sands and ventures a guess that if it does not turn the whole deposit into a burning inferno it is almost sure to fuse it into a solid mass of semi [[glass]] or [[coke (coal)|coke]]."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://history.alberta.ca/energyheritage/sands/mega-projects/setting-the-stage/the-second-athabasca-oil-sands-conference/project-oil-sand.aspx |title= Project Oilsand |publisher= Government of Alberta |access-date= 2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1959, the [[Natural Resources Canada|Federal Mines Department]] approved Project Oilsand.&lt;ref name="petroleumhistory2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petroleumhistory.ca/archivesnews/2005/06-jun/phs05-06.pdf |title=Petroleum History Society Archives Newsletter June 2005 |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, before the project could continue beyond preliminary steps, the Canadian government's stance on the use of nuclear devices changed. In April 1962, the Canadian [[Secretary of State for External Affairs (Canada)|Secretary of State for External Affairs]] said "Canada is opposed to nuclear tests, period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthfuture.com/econews/back_issues/05-12.asp |title=EcoNews, Serving the Vision of a Sustainable Vancouver Island |publisher=Earthfuture.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These 1962 changes in Canadian public opinion is regarded by historian Michael Payne to be due to the shift in public perception of nuclear explosives following the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]],&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070824172227/http://www.innovationalberta.com/article.php?articleid=92 #32 Project Oil Sands, Alberta's Experience with the Atomic Bomb, Dr. Michael Payne]&lt;/ref&gt; Project Oilsand was subsequently cancelled. Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] told Parliament that the decision to detonate an atomic bomb on or under Canadian soil would be made by Canada, not the United States, and ordered Project Cauldron/Oilsand placed on permanent hold, citing the risk of upsetting the Soviet Union during nuclear disarmament negotiations being conducted in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.calgarysun.com/2015/10/03/albertas-oilsands-almost-saw-nuclear-detonation-to-free-up-trapped-bitumen-as-part-of-operation-cauldron-in-the-1950s |title= Alberta's oilsands almost saw nuclear detonation to free up trapped bitumen as part of Operation Cauldron in the 1950s |last1= Pratt |first1= Michael |date= October 3, 2015 |website= [[Calgary Sun]] |access-date= 2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government continued with exploring the peaceful uses of nuclear detonations with [[Operation Plowshare]], but was likewise eventually terminated in 1977. While [[social scientist]], [[Benjamin Sovacool]] contends that the main problem was that the produced oil and gas was radioactive, which caused consumers to reject it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Benjamin K. | last = Sovacool | author-link = Benjamin K.

Furthermore, as the years went by without further development and the closing/curtailment in US nuclear weapons factories, this began to evaporate the [[economies of scale]] advantage that had earlier existed, with this, it was increasingly found that most US fields could instead be stimulated by non-nuclear techniques which were found to be likely cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osti.gov/opennet/reports/plowshar.pdf Plowshare Program Executive Summary, pg 4–5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040706025511/http://www.elmada.com/wagon/WWS005Projects.htm Nuclear Stimulation Projects]&lt;/ref&gt;  The most [[Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy|successful and profitable nuclear stimulation effort]] that did not result in customer product contamination issues was the 1976 [[Project Neva]] on the Sredne-Botuobinsk gas field in the [[Soviet Union]], made possible by multiple cleaner stimulation explosives, favourable rock strata and the possible creation of an underground contaminant storage cavity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_uranium27.htm Milo D.

===Great Canadian Oil Sands===
{{main|Suncor}}
The oil sands, which are typically {{convert|40|to|60|m}} thick and sit on top of relatively flat [[limestone]], are relatively easy to access. They lie under {{cvt|1|to|3|m}} of waterlogged [[muskeg]], {{convert|0|to|75|m}} of clay and barren sand. As a result of the easy accessibility, the world's first oil-sands mine was in the Athabasca oil sands.

Commercial production of oil from the Athabasca oil sands began in 1967, with the opening of the Great Canadian Oil Sands (GCOS) plant in [[Fort McMurray]]. It was the first operational oil sands project in the world, owned and operated by the American parent company, [[Sun Oil|Sun Oil Company]]. When the [[US$]]240&amp;nbsp;million plant officially opened with a capacity of {{convert|45,000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, it marked the beginning of commercial development of the Athabasca oil sands. In 2013 McKenzie-Brown listed industrialist [[J. Howard Pew]] as one of the six visionaries who built the Athabasca oil sands.&lt;ref name="McKenzie-Brown_2013"&gt;{{citation |title=Six visionaries who built the modern oil sands |first=Peter |last=McKenzie-Brown |series=Canadian Association of Lifelong Learners and |work=The Petroleum History Society |url=http://www.capp.ca/getdoc.aspx?NTB=PDF&amp;docID=224681 |date=22 January 2013 |location=Calgary, Alberta |accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death in 1971, the Pew family were ranked by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as one of the half-dozen wealthiest families in America.&lt;ref name="Philly_1992"&gt;{{citation |url=http://articles.philly.com/1992-04-27/news/26001700_1_pew-grants-pew-officials-foundation |title=How A Foundation Reinvented Itself |first=Lucinda |last=Fleeson, |date=27 April 1992 |work=Philly.com |accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited (then a subsidiary of [[Sun Oil Company]] but now incorporated into an independent company known as [[Suncor Energy Inc.]]) produced {{convert|30,000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of synthetic crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The man who saw gold in Alberta's oil sands |first=Gordon |last=Pitts |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/the-man-who-saw-gold-in-albertas-oil-sands/article4498369/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=25 August 2012 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=27 August 2012 |quote=Sixty-one years ago, a lowly Calgary employee of U.S. multinational Sun Oil Co. wrote a subversive letter to the company brass in Philadelphia. The message spit in the eye of his local managers in Alberta: "I have long felt that our company should take a permit to explore for oil from the Tar Sands of Alberta," 30-year-old Ned Gilbert wrote in September, 1951, in defiance of his immediate superiors, who opposed the idea of going any further than their first tentative steps in the area.  Suncor has emerged as the elite player among Canadian-controlled oil companies, valued at almost $50-billion. (Sun Oil divested its stake in the company in the early 1990s.) Suncor's pre-eminence stems directly from Great Canadian Oil Sands, the first commercial oil sands project, which was launched by Sun Oil in 1967.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Sun formed Suncor by merging its Canadian refining and retailing interests with [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)|Great Canadian Oil Sands]] and its conventional oil and gas interests. In 1981, the Government of Ontario purchased a 25% stake in the company but divested it in 1993. In 1995 Sun Oil also divested its interest in the company, although Suncor maintained the Sunoco retail brand in Canada. Suncor took advantage of these two divestitures to become an independent, widely held [[public company]].

Suncor continued to grow and continued to produce more and more oil from its oil sands operations regardless of fluctuating market prices, and eventually became bigger than its former parent company. In 2009, Suncor acquired the formerly Canadian government owned oil company, [[Petro-Canada]],&lt;ref name=CBC2009&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2009/03/23/suncor-petro-canada-merge.html |title=Suncor, Petro-Canada announce merger |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2009/08/03/daily65.html|title=Suncor, Petro Canada complete merger|accessdate=2009-08-11 |date=2009-08-06 |work=bizjournals}}&lt;/ref&gt; which turned Suncor into the largest [[Canadian petroleum companies|petroleum company in Canada]] and one of the biggest Canadian companies. Suncor Energy is now a Canadian company completely unaffiliated with its former American parent company. [[Sun Oil]] Company became known as [[Sunoco]], but later left the oil production and refining business, and has since become a retail gasoline distributor owned by [[Energy Transfer Partners]] of [[Dallas]], Texas. In Canada, [[Suncor Energy]] converted all of its Sunoco stations (which were all in Ontario) to Petro-Canada sites in order to unify all of its downstream retail operations under the Petro-Canada banner and discontinue paying licensing fees for the Sunoco brand. Nationwide, Petro-Canada's upstream product supplier and parent company is Suncor Energy. Suncor Energy continues to operate just one Sunoco retail site in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://retail.petro-canada.ca/en/independent/616.aspx |title= Petro Canada: Legal &amp; Privacy |publisher= [[Petro Canada]] |access-date= 2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syncrude==
{{main|Syncrude}}

The true size of the Canadian oil sands deposits became known in the 1970s. The [[Syncrude]] mine opened in 1978 and is now the largest mine (by area) in the world, with mines potentially covering {{cvt|140,000|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = James | last = Bjorkman |url= http://animatedfilmreviews.filminspector.com/2014/05/alberta-tar-sands-explained-informative.html |title= Alberta Tar Sands Explained - An Informative Animation |accessdate=2014-05-17 |publisher= Animated Film Reviews }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although there is oil underlying {{cvt|142,200|km2}}, which may be disturbed by drilling and in situ extraction, only {{cvt|4,800|km2}} may potentially be surface mined, and {{cvt|904|km2}} has to date been mined.)

==1973 oil crisis==
{{main|1973 oil crisis}}
Development was inhibited by declining world oil prices, and the second mine, operated by the [[Syncrude]] consortium, did not begin operating until 1978, after the [[1973 oil crisis]] sparked investor interest.

==1979 energy crisis==
{{main|1979 energy crisis}}
However the [[price of oil]] subsided afterwards and although the [[1979 energy crisis]] caused oil prices to peak again, during the 1980s, [[1980s oil glut|oil prices declined to very low levels]] causing considerable retrenchment in the oil industry.

==Oil sands production in the 21st century==
At the turn of the 21st century, oil sands development in Canada started to take off, with an expansion at the Suncor mine, a new mine and expansion at Syncrude, and a new mine by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] associated with their new [[Scotford Upgrader]] near [[Edmonton]]. Three new large steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects were added – Foster Creek, Surmont, and MacKay River – by different companies, all of which have since been bought by larger companies.&lt;ref name="Dusseault_2001"&gt;

[[Shell Canada]]'s third mine began operating in 2003. However, as a result of oil price increases since 2003, the existing mines have been greatly expanded and new ones are being planned.

According to the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, 2005 production of crude bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands was as follows:

As of 2006, oil sands production had increased to {{convert|1126000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. Oil sands were the source of 62% of Alberta's total oil production and 47% of all oil produced in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, oil sands production had increased to over {{convert|1.6|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}, where 53% of this was produced by surface mining and 47% by in-situ. The Alberta government believes this level of production could reach {{convert|3.5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} by 2020 and possibly {{convert|5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Future production ==

As of December 2008, the [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] revised its 2008–2020 crude oil forecasts to account for project cancellations and cutbacks as a result of the price declines in the second half of 2008. The revised forecast predicted that Canadian oil sands production would continue to grow, but at a slower rate than previously predicted. There would be minimal changes to 2008–2012 production, but by 2020 production could be {{convert|300000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} less than its prior predictions. This would mean that Canadian oil sands production would grow from {{convert|1.2|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2008 to {{convert|3.3|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2020, and that total Canadian oil production would grow from {{convert|2.7|to|4.1|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;

In early December 2007, London-based [[BP]] and Calgary-based [[Husky Energy]] announced a 50–50 [[joint venture]] to produce and refine bitumen from the Athabasca oil sands. BP would contribute its [[Toledo, Ohio]] refinery to the joint venture, while Husky would contribute its Sunrise oil sands project. Sunrise was planned to start producing {{convert|60000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of bitumen in 2012 and may reach {{convert|200000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} by 2015–2020. BP would modify its Toledo refinery to process {{convert|170000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen directly to refined products. The joint venture would solve problems for both companies, since Husky was short of refining capacity, and BP had no presence in the oil sands. It was a change of strategy for BP, since the company historically has downplayed the importance of oil sands.&lt;ref&gt;

In mid December 2007, [[ConocoPhillips]] announced its intention to increase its oil sands production from {{convert|60000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} to {{convert|1|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} over the next 20 years, which would make it the largest private sector oil sands producer in the world. ConocoPhillips currently holds the largest position in the Canadian oil sands with over {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}} under lease. Other major oil sands producers planning to increase their production include [[Royal Dutch Shell]] (to {{convert|770000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}); [[Syncrude|Syncrude Canada]] (to {{convert|550000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}); [[Suncor Energy]] (to {{convert|500000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}) and [[Canadian Natural Resources]] (to {{convert|500000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;

== Governance ==

The governance of the [[Alberta]] oil sands is focused on economic development, and has historically been dominated by the interests of two primary actors; government (federal and provincial) and industry. [[Canadian federalism]] forms the functions and roles of each level of government, in that constitutional power is split so that neither is superior to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Livingston |first=W.&amp;nbsp;S. |title=A Note on the Nature of Federalism |journal=Political Science Quarterly |date=March 1952 |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=81–95 |doi=10.2307/2145299|jstor=2145299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution Act, 1867]], Section 109 ensures the province full ownership of the lands and resources within its borders. The province acts as the landowner and the federal government oversees jurisdiction over trade, commerce and taxation.  There is a clear overlap, as resource management influences trade, and trade management influences resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cairns |first=R.&amp;nbsp;D. |title=Natural Resources and Canadian Federalism: Decentralization, Recurring Conflict, and Resolution |journal=The Journal of Federalism|year=1992|volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=55–70 |doi=10.2307/3330233|jstor=3330233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 1990s, both the federal and provincial government have been aligned, focusing on regulation, technology and the development of new export markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chastko |first=P. |title=Developing Alberta’s Oil Sands: From Karl Clark to Kyoto |year=2004 |publisher=University of Calgary Press |location=Calgary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of "ground-level" governance is carried out by a number of provincial institutions.

Ottawa has avoided direct investment, preferring to improve the investment climate.  A prime example of this occurred in 1994, when the federal government rolled out tax breaks allowing 100% of oil sands capital investments to be written off as accelerated capital cost allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=A |title=Thinking Like an Owner: Fact Sheet – Overhauling the royalty and tax treatment of Alberta’s oil sands |year=2006 |publisher=The Pembina Institute |location=Drayton Valley, Alta}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial government had a much more direct role in development; investing directly in numerous pilot projects, undertaking joint ventures with the industry and consistently making massive investments in research and development. Some people have claimed that Alberta features one of the lowest royalty rates in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Council of Canadians |title=Submission to the Alberta Royalty Review Panel presented by Lyn Gorman on behalf of the Council of Canadians |year=2007 |publisher=Council of Canadians |location=Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Alberta, unlike US states, owns the vast majority of oil under its surface it can exercise more control over it, whereas US states are limited to severance taxes. This industry-centric royalty system has been criticised for "promoting a runaway pace of development".&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Jeffrey P.&amp;nbsp;T. |title=Multistakeholderism in Oil Sands Governance |ssrn=1140304 |publisher=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alberta Royalty Review Panel |title=Our Fair Share |journal=Alberta Royalty Review Panel |date=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry is the core force of oil sands development. The first major players, [[Suncor Energy]] and [[Syncrude]], dominated the market until the 1990s. Currently there are 64 companies operating several hundred projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oil Sands InfoMine|title=Oil Sands Company/Property Mine|url=http://oilsands.infomine.com/companiesproperties/|accessdate=1 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430171043/http://oilsands.infomine.com/companiesproperties/|archive-date=2011-04-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of production now comes from foreign-owned corporations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crane |first=D |title=Controlling Interest: The Canadian Gas and Oil Stakes|year=1982|publisher=McClelland and Stewart Limited |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the maintenance of a favourable climate for these corporations grants them strong influence; much stronger than that of non-productive stakeholders, such as citizens and environmental groups.&lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt;

Governance (policy, administration, regulation) over the oil sands is held almost entirely by the [[Ministry of Energy (Alberta)]] and its various departments. Critics noted a clear and systemic lack of public involvement at all key stages of the governance process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vlavianos |first=N. |title=The Legislative and Regulatory Framework for Oil Sands Development in Alberta: A Detailed Review and Analysis |journal=Canadian Institute of Resources Law |date=August 2007 |volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In answer to this, the province initiated the Oil Sands Consultations Multistakeholder Committee (MSC) in 2006.  The MSC represents four organisations: the Cumulative Environmental Management Association (CEMA), the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association (WBEA), the Canadian Oil Sands Network for Research and Development (CONRAD) and the Athabasca Regional Issues Working Group (RIWG).&lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt; The role of the MSC is to consult and make recommendations on management principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Government of Alberta|title=Terms of Reference – Oil Sands Consultation Group – Background |journal=Government of Alberta |date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations contained in the MSC’s first 2007 Final Report were lauded by several ministers and government representatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Government of Alberta |title=News Release.

On October 17, 2012, the Alberta government announced it would follow the recommendations of a working group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://environment.gov.ab.ca/info/library/8699.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325201851/http://environment.gov.ab.ca/info/library/8699.pdf |archive-date=2013-03-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop an agency that would monitor the environmental impact of the oil sands. "The new science-based agency will begin work in the oil sands region and will focus on what is monitored, how it’s monitored and where it’s monitored. This will include integrated and coordinated monitoring of land, air, water and biodiversity," said a press release from Diana McQueen's office, the Minister of Energy and Sustainable Development.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Alberta [http://alberta.ca/acn/201210/33115701C6E68-EBBC-DF50-F7CCA9C17B88AC98.html Alberta to establish arm's-length environmental monitoring agency] Retrieved (2012-10-21).&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial government moved to develop the agency after widespread public criticism by environmentalists, aboriginal groups and scientists, who claimed the oil sands would have a devastating, long-term effect on the environment if left unchecked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com Financial Post.] [http://business.financialpost.com/2012/02/03/stung-by-critics-canada-launches-new-oil-sands-monitoring-policy/ Canada launches new oil sands monitoring policy] Retrieved 21 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

The key characteristic of the Athabasca deposit is that it is the only one shallow enough to be suitable for [[surface mining]]. About 10% of the Athabasca oil sands are covered by less than {{convert|75|m|ft|0}} of [[overburden]]. Until 2009, the surface mineable area (SMA) was defined by the ERCB, an agency of the Alberta government, to cover 37 contiguous townships (about {{convert|3400|km2|sqmi|-2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) north of [[Fort McMurray]]. In June 2009, the SMA was expanded to {{frac|51|1|2}} townships, or about {{convert|4700|km2|sqmi|-2|disp=or|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;ERCB ST-98 (June 2009) pp. 2-2 to 2-7&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion pushes the northern limit of the SMA to within {{convert|12|mi|km}} of [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

The Albian Sands mine (operated by [[Shell Canada]]) opened in 2003. All three of these mines are associated with bitumen [[upgrader]]s that convert the unusable bitumen into [[synthetic crude]] oil for shipment to [[refineries]] in Canada and the [[United States]]. For Albian, the upgrader is located at Scotford, 439&amp;nbsp;km south. The bitumen, diluted with a solvent, is transferred there in a {{convert|610|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} corridor pipeline.

The Energy Resource Conservation Board has approved over 100 mining and in-situ projects despite the negative environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Nikiforuk, A.  | year = 2008 | title = Tar Sands: Dirty Oil and the Future of a Continent | location = Vancouver | publisher = Greystone Books | isbn = 978-1-55365-407-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, there was 9 active open mining projects, more than 50 approved in-situ projects as well as 190 primary recovery projects extracting bitumen that is free flowing. The ERCB has also approved 20 projects that are testing unproven technology as well as new versions of existing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ercb.ca/learn-about-energy/oilsands |title=Oil Sands |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bitumen extraction ==
{{Main|Oil sands#Extraction process}}

===Surface mining===
Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor) started operation of its mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale from the Athabasca Oil Sands by [[surface mining]]. In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of bitumen covered by little overburden, making surface mining the most efficient method of extracting it. The overburden consists of water-laden [[muskeg]] (peat bog) over top of clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically {{convert|40|to|60|m}} deep, sitting on top of flat [[limestone]] rock. Originally, the sands were mined with [[dragline]]s and [[bucket-wheel excavator]]s and moved to the processing plants by [[conveyor belt]]s.

These early mines had a steep learning curve to deal with before their bitumen mining techniques became efficient. In the intervening years, more effective [[in-situ]] production techniques were developed, particularly [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD). In-situ methods became increasingly important because only about 20% of the Athabasca oil sands were shallow enough to recover by surface mining, and the SAGD method in particular was very efficient at recovering large amounts of bitumen at a reasonable cost.

In recent years, companies such as Syncrude and Suncor have switched to much cheaper shovel-and-truck operations using the biggest [[power shovel]]s (at least {{convert|100|ST|t|disp=comma}}) and [[dump truck]]s ({{convert|400|ST|t|disp=comma}}) in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After excavation, hot water and [[caustic soda]] ([[sodium hydroxide]]) is added to the sand, and the resulting [[slurry]] is piped to the extraction plant where it is agitated and the oil skimmed from the top.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provided that the water chemistry is appropriate to allow bitumen to separate from sand and clay, the combination of hot water and agitation releases bitumen from the oil sand, and allows small air bubbles to attach to the bitumen droplets. The bitumen froth floats to the top of separation vessels, and is further treated to remove residual water and fine solids.

About {{convert|2|ST|t|spell=in}} of oil sands are required to produce one barrel ({{convert|1/8|ST|kg|disp=comma}}) of oil. Originally, roughly 75% of the bitumen was recovered from the sand. However, recent enhancements to this method include [[Tailings]] Oil Recovery (TOR) units which recover oil from the [[tailings]], [[Diluent]] Recovery Units to recover [[naphtha]] from the froth, [[Lamella clarifier|inclined plate settlers]] (IPS) and disc [[centrifuge]]s. These allow the extraction plants to recover well over 90% of the bitumen in the sand. After oil extraction, the spent sand and other materials are then returned to the mine, which is eventually [[land reclamation|reclaimed]].

[[Alberta Taciuk Process]] technology extracts bitumen from oil sands through a dry retorting. During this process, oil sand is moved through a rotating drum, [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] the bitumen with heat and producing lighter hydrocarbons. Although tested, this technology is not in commercial use yet.&lt;ref name=atp&gt;

In this process, the ores are mined using open-pit mining technology. The mined ore is then crushed for size reduction.  Hot water at {{cvt|50|-|80|°C}} is added to the ore and the formed slurry is transported using hydrotransport line to a primary separation vessel (PSV) where bitumen is recovered by flotation as bitumen froth. The recovered bitumen froth consists of 60% bitumen, 30% water and 10% solids by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gu |first1=G. |last2=Xu |first2=Z. |last3=Nandakumar |first3=K. |last4=Masliyah |first4=J.&amp;nbsp;H. | year = 2002 | title = Influence of water-soluble and water-insoluble natural surface active components on the stability of water-in-toluene-diluted bitumen emulsion | url = | journal = Fuel | volume = 81 | issue = 14| pages = 1859–1869 | doi=10.1016/s0016-2361(02)00113-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recovered bitumen froth needs to be cleaned to reject the contained solids and water to meet the requirement of downstream upgrading processes. Depending on the bitumen content in the ore, between 90 and 100% of the bitumen can be recovered using modern hot water extraction techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R.&amp;nbsp;J. |last1=Mikula |first2=O. |last2=Omotoso |first3=W.&amp;nbsp;I. |last3=Friesen |year=2007 |title=Interpretation of Bitumen Recovery Data from Batch Extraction Tests |journal=Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=765–772 |doi=10.1002/cjce.5450850522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After oil extraction, the spent sand and other materials are then returned to the mine, which is eventually reclaimed.

=== Steam-assisted gravity drainage ===
{{Main|Steam-assisted gravity drainage}}
Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is an [[enhanced oil recovery]] technology for producing [[heavy crude oil]] and [[bitumen]]. It is an advanced form of [[steam injection (oil industry)|steam stimulation]] in which a pair of [[directional drilling|horizontal well]]s are drilled into the [[Petroleum reservoir|oil reservoir]], one a few metres above the other. High pressure steam is continuously injected into the upper [[wellbore]] to heat the oil and reduce its [[viscosity]], causing the heated oil to drain into the lower wellbore, where it is pumped out to a bitumen recovery facility. Dr. Roger Butler, engineer at [[Imperial Oil]] from 1955 to 1982, invented steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) in the 1970s. Butler "developed the concept of using horizontal pairs of wells and injected steam to develop certain deposits of bitumen considered too deep for mining."&lt;ref name="butlerhalloffame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/roger-butler.html|title=Dr. Roger M. Butler|year=2012|publisher=Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guidebook"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/ccg/pdfs/Vol3-IntroSAGD.pdf |title=Guide to SAGD (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage) Reservoir Characterization Using Geostatistics |publisher=Centre for Computational Geostatistics |author1=C.V.

More recently, ''in situ'' methods like [[steam assisted gravity drainage|steam-assisted gravity-drainage]] (SAGD) and [[steam injection (oil industry)|cyclic steam stimulation]] (CSS) have been developed to extract bitumen from deep deposits by injecting steam to heat the sands and reduce the bitumen viscosity so that it can be pumped out like conventional crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;

The standard extraction process requires huge amounts of natural gas. As of 2007, the oil sands industry used about 4% of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin natural gas production. By 2015, this may increase two-and-a-half-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.neb-one.gc.ca/clf-nsi/rnrgynfmtn/nrgyrprt/nrgyftr/2007/nrgyftr2007-eng.pdf |title=Canada’s Energy Future: Reference Case and Scenarios to 2030 |pages=45–48 |isbn=978-0-662-46855-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Energy Board]], it requires about {{convert|1200|cuft|m3}} of natural gas to produce one barrel of bitumen from ''in situ'' projects and about {{convert|700|cuft|m3}} for integrated projects.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a [[barrel of oil equivalent]] is about {{convert|6000|cuft|m3}} of gas, this represents a large gain in energy. That being the case, it is likely that Alberta regulators will reduce exports of natural gas to the United States in order to provide fuel to the oil sands plants. As gas reserves are exhausted, however, oil upgraders will probably turn to bitumen [[gasification]] to generate their own fuel. In much the same way as bitumen can be converted into synthetic crude oil, it can also be converted into synthetic natural gas.

=== Land ===

Approximately 20% of Alberta's oil sands are recoverable through [[open-pit mining]], while 80% require ''in situ'' extraction technologies (largely because of their depth).  Open pit mining destroys the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] and [[muskeg]], while ''in situ'' extraction technologies cause less significant damage. Approximately 0.19% of the Alberta boreal forest has been disturbed by open pit mining.&lt;ref name="Alberta Energy"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/oilsands/791.asp#Environment
 |title=Alberta Energy: Facts and Statistics
 |publisher=Alberta Energy
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alberta government requires companies to restore the land to "equivalent land capability". This means that the ability of the land to support various land uses after reclamation is similar to what existed, but that the individual land uses may not necessarily be identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In some particular circumstances the government considers agricultural land to be equivalent to forest land. Oil sands companies have reclaimed mined land to use as pasture for [[wood bison]] instead of restoring it to the original boreal forest and muskeg. Syncrude asserts they have reclaimed 22% of their disturbed land,&lt;ref&gt;

=== Water ===

A [[Pembina Institute]] report stated "To produce one cubic metre (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) [{{cvt|1|m3|cuft|disp=out}}] of synthetic crude oil (SCO) (upgraded bitumen) in a mining operation requires about {{cvt|2|-|4.5|m3|disp=sqbr}} of water (net figures). Approved oil sands mining operations are currently licensed to divert 359 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; from the Athabasca River, or more than twice the volume of water required to meet the annual municipal needs of the City of Calgary."&lt;ref&gt;

}} (advocacy)&lt;/ref&gt;  It went on to say "...the net water requirement to produce a cubic metre of oil with ''in situ'' production may be as little as {{cvt|0.2|m3|disp=sqbr}}, depending on how much is recycled".

The Athabasca River runs {{convert|1231|km}} from the [[Athabasca Glacier]] in west-central Alberta to [[Lake Athabasca]] in northeastern Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since the beginning of the oil sands development, there have been several leaks into the Athabasca River polluting it with oil and tailing pond water. The close proximity of the tailing ponds to the river drastically increases the likelihood of contamination due to ground water leakages. In 1997, Suncor admitted that their tailing ponds had been leaking {{convert|1600|m3}} of toxic water into the river a day. This water contains naphthenic acid, [[trace metal]]s such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and other pollutants. The Athabasca River is the largest freshwater delta in the world but with Suncor and Syncrude leaking tail ponds the amount of polluted water will exceed 1 billion cubic meters by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=We can no longer be sacrificed |author= L.T Waller |journal= Political Science |year= 2008 |accessdate= |publisher=Briarpatch Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural toxicants derived from bitumen in Northern Alberta pose potential ecological and human health risks to northerners living in the area. Oil sands development contributes [[arsenic]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[nickel]] and other metal elements toxic at low concentrations to the tributaries and rivers of the Athabasca.&lt;ref name="doi: 10.1073/pnas.1008754107"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Erin N.

=== Natural gas use and greenhouse gases ===

The processing of bitumen into synthetic crude requires energy, which is currently being generated by burning natural gas.  In 2007, the oil sands used around {{convert|1|e9cuft|m3}} of natural gas per day, around 40% of Alberta's total usage.  Based on gas purchases, natural gas requirements are given by the Canadian Energy Resource Institute as 2.14 GJ (2.04 thousand cu ft) per barrel for [[Steam injection (oil industry)|cyclic steam stimulation]] projects, 1.08 GJ (1.03 thousand cu ft) per barrel for [[SAGD]] projects, 0.55 GJ (0.52 thousand cu ft) per barrel for bitumen extraction in mining operations not including upgrading or 1.54 GJ (1.47 thousand cu ft) per barrel for extraction and upgrading in mining operations.&lt;ref name="CERI 118"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=David |last1=McColl |author-link= |first2=Martin |last2=Slagorsky |title=Canadian Oil Sands Supply Costs and Development Projects |date=November 2008 |publisher=Canadian Energy Research Institute |isbn=1-896091-83-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study by CERA estimated that production from Canada's oil sands
emits "about 5 percent to 15 percent more carbon dioxide, over the
"well-to-wheels" lifetime analysis of the fuel, than average crude
oil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| publisher=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and investigative journalist David Strahan that same year stated that IEA figures show that carbon dioxide emissions from the oil sands are 20% higher than average emissions from oil, explaining the discrepancy as the difference between upstream emissions and life cycle emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Alberta energy suggests lower releases of carbon with improving technology, giving a value of 39% drop in emissions per barrel between 1990 and 2008,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.alberta.ca/OilSands/791.asp&lt;/ref&gt; however only a 29% reduction between 1990 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://oilsands.alberta.ca/FactSheets/GHG_and_the_oil_sands_July_20_2011(1).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The forecast growth in synthetic oil production in Alberta also threatens Canada's international commitments. In ratifying the [[Kyoto Protocol]], Canada agreed to reduce, by 2012, its greenhouse gas emissions by 6% with respect to 1990. In 2002, Canada's total greenhouse gas emissions had increased by 24% since 1990. 

Ranked as the world's eighth largest emitter of greenhouse gases, Canada is a relatively large emitter given its population and is missing its Kyoto targets. A major Canadian initiative called the Integrated CO2 Network (ICO2N) promotes the development of large scale capture, transport and storage of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a means of helping Canada to help meet climate change objectives while supporting economic growth. ICO2N members represent a group of industry participants, many oil sands producers, providing a framework for [[carbon capture and storage]] development in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico2n.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ICO2N_Report_09_final1.pdf "Carbon Capture and Storage"] October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animals ===

In Northern Alberta, oil development activities bring an enormous number of people into a fragile ecosystem. Historically, population figures have been very low for this region. Water is easily polluted because the water table reaches the surface in most areas of [[muskeg]]. With the ever-increasing development and extraction of resources, wildlife are recipient to both direct and indirect effects of pollution. Woodland [[Caribou]] are particularly sensitive to human activities, and as such are pushed away from their preferred habitat during the time of year when their caloric needs are greatest and food is the most scarce. Humans' effect on the Caribou is compounded by road construction and habitat fragmentation that open the area up to deer and wolves.&lt;ref&gt;SK Wasser, JL Keim, ML Taper, SR Lele. 2011. The influences of wolf predation, habitat loss, and human activity on caribou and moose in the Alberta oil sands. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildlife living near the Athabasca River have been greatly impacted due to pollutants entering the water system. An unknown number of birds die each year. Particularly visible and hard hit are migrating birds that stop to rest at tailing ponds. There have been numerous reports of large flocks of ducks landing in tailing ponds and perishing soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/oil-sands-death-of-hundreds-of-ducks-in-2010-blamed-on-weather-no-charges-laid|title=Oil sands death of hundreds of ducks in 2010 blamed on weather, no charges laid|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data has been recorded since the 1970s on the number of birds found on tailing ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Annual Bird Mortality in the Bitumen Tailing Ponds in northeastern Alberta, Canada

There has also been a large impact on the fish that live and spawn in the area. As toxins accumulate in the river due to the oil sands, bizarre mutations, tumors, and deformed fish species have begun to appear. A study commissioned by the region's health authority found that several known toxins and carcinogens were elevated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= We can no longer be sacrificed |author= L.T. Waller |journal= Political Science |year= 2008 |accessdate= |publisher=Briarpatch Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal communities that live around the river are becoming increasingly worried about how the animals they eat and their drinking water are being affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

While there has been no link yet made between the oil sands and health issues, Matt Price of Environmental Defense says the connection makes common sense. Deformities in fish and high concentrations of toxic substances in animals have also been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |title=Health concerns rise over oil sands pollution: Aboriginal Multi-Media Society of Alberta |author= J.

=== Tailings ponds ===
{{see also|Oil sands tailings ponds}}
Large volumes of tailings are a byproduct of bitumen extraction from the oil sands and managing these tailings is one of the most difficult environmental challenges facing the oil sands industry.&lt;ref name="AB_FactSheet2013" /&gt; Tailings ponds are engineered dam and dyke systems that contain solvents used in the separation process as well as residual bitumen, salts and soluble organic compounds, fine silts and water.&lt;ref name="AB_FactSheet2013" /&gt; The concentrations of chemicals may be harmful to fish and oil on the surface harmful to birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://osqar.suncor.com/2014/03/tailings-ponds-what-theyre-made-of.html#sthash.al9AX44Y.dpuf|title=Tailings Ponds: What they;re made of|publisher=Suncor}}&lt;/ref&gt; These settling basins were meant to be temporary. A major hindrance to the monitoring of oil sands produced waters has been the lack of identification of individual compounds present. By better understanding the nature of the highly [[Unresolved complex mixture|complex mixture]] of compounds, including [[naphthenic acid]]s, it may be possible to monitor rivers for [[leachate]] and also to remove toxic components. Such identification of individual acids has for many years proved to be impossible but a breakthrough in 2011 in analysis began to reveal what is in the oil sands tailings ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors=Rowland SJ, Scarlett AG, Jones D, West CE, Frank RA. |title=Diamonds in the Rough: Identification of Individual Naphthenic Acids in Oil Sands Process Water |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume=45|issue=7 |pages= 3154–3159|year=2011|doi=10.1021/es103721b|bibcode=2011EnST...45.3154R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety percent of the tailings water can be reused for oil extraction.&lt;ref name="AB_FactSheet2013" /&gt; By 2009 as tailing ponds continued to proliferate and volumes of fluid tailings increased, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board issued Directive 074 to force oil companies to manage tailings based on new aggressive criteria.&lt;ref name="ERCB2013" /&gt;  The Government of Alberta reported in 2013 that tailings ponds in the Alberta oil sands covered an area of about {{convert|77|km2}}.&lt;ref name="AB_FactSheet2013"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.oilsands.alberta.ca/FactSheets/Tailings_FSht_Sep_2013_Online.pdf |format=PDF |date=September 2013 |title=Fact Sheet Tailings |work=Government of Alberta |accessdate=12 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325201452/http://oilsands.alberta.ca/FactSheets/Tailings_FSht_Sep_2013_Online.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tailings Management Framework for Mineable Oil Sands is part of Alberta’s Progressive Reclamation Strategy for the oil sands to ensure that tailings are reclaimed as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="ERCB2013"&gt;{{citation|title=2012 Tailings Management Assessment Report: Oil Sands Mining Industry|date=June 2013|accessdate=12 April 2014|url=http://www.aer.ca/documents/oilsands/tailings-plans/TailingsManagementAssessmentReport2011-2012.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB)|location=Calgary, Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225233211/http://www.aer.ca/documents/oilsands/tailings-plans/TailingsManagementAssessmentReport2011-2012.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mature tailings dredged from a pond bottom in [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] were mixed with a polymer [[flocculation|flocculant]] and spread over a "beach" with a shallow grade where the tailings would dewater and dry under ambient conditions. The dried MFT can then be reclaimed in place or moved to another location for final reclamation. Suncor hoped this would reduce the time for [[water reclamation]] from tailings to weeks rather than years, with the recovered water being [[water conservation|recycled]] into the oil sands plant. Suncor claimed the mature fines tailings process would reduce the number of tailing ponds and shorten the time to reclaim a tailing pond from 40 years at present to 7–10 years, with [[land rehabilitation]] continuously following 7 to 10 years behind the mining operations.&lt;ref&gt;

By 2010 Suncor had transformed their first tailings pond, Pond One, into Wapisiw Lookout, the first reclaimed settling basin in the oil sands. In 2007 the area was a 220-hectare pond of toxic effluent but several years later there was firm land planted with black spruce and trembling aspen. Wapisiw Lookout represents only one percent of tailings ponds in 2011 but Pond One was the first effluent pond in the oil sands industry in 1967 and was used until 1997. By 2011 only 65 square kilometres were cleaned up and about one square kilometre was certified by Alberta as a self-sustaining natural environment. Wapisiw Lookout has not yet been certified. Closure operations of Pond One began in 2007. The jello-like mature fine tails (MFT) were pumped and dredged out of the pond and relocated to another tailings pond for long-term storage and treatment. The MFT was then replaced with 30 million tonnes clean sand and then topsoil that had been removed from the site in the 1960s. The {{convert|1.2|e6m3|e6cuft|sp=us}} of topsoil over the surface, to a depth of {{convert|abbr=on|50|cm|ftin}}, was placed on top of the sand in the form of hummocks and swales.

In March 2012 an alliance of oil companies called Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) was launched with a mandate to share research and technology to decrease the negative environmental impact of oil sands production focusing on tailings ponds, greenhouse gases, water and land. Almost all the water used to produce crude oil using steam methods of production ends up in tailings ponds.  Recent enhancements to this method include [[Tailings]] Oil Recovery (TOR) units which recover oil from the [[tailings]], [[Diluent]] Recovery Units to recover [[naphtha]] from the froth, Inclined Plate [[Settling|Settlers]] (IPS) and disc [[centrifuge]]s. These allow the extraction plants to recover well over 90% of the bitumen in the sand.

In January 2013, scientists from [[Queen's University]] published a report analyzing lake sediments in the Athabasca region over the past fifty years.&lt;ref name="Kurek"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurek|first=J. |author2=Kirk J.L. |author3=Muir D.C.G. |author4=Wang X. |author5=Evans M.S.  |author6=Smol J.P.|year=2013|title=Legacy of a half century of Athabasca oil sands development recorded by lake ecosystems|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|publisher= National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|pages=1–6|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/01/02/1217675110.full.pdf|accessdate=9 January 2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1217675110 |volume=110 |issue=5 |pmid=23297215 |pmc=3562817|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.1761K}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that levels of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) had increased as much as 23-fold since bitumen extraction began in the 1960s. Levels of carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic PAHs were substantially higher than guidelines for lake sedimentation set by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment in 1999. The team discovered that the contamination spread farther than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/world/americas/oil-sand-industry-in-canada-tied-to-higher-carcinogen-level.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Ian | last=Austen | title=Oil Sand Industry in Canada Tied to Higher Carcinogen Level | date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pembina Institute]] suggested that the huge investments by many companies in Canadian oil sands leading to increased production results in excess bitumen with no place to store it. It added that by 2022 a month’s output of waste-water could result in a {{convert|11|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep|0}} toxic reservoir the size of New York City's [[Central Park]] [840.01 acres (339.94 ha) (3.399&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-22/oil-sands-miners-play-russian-roulette-with-toxic-water.html|title=Toxic Lakes From Tar-Sand Projects Planned for Alberta|first=Jeremy |last=van Loon|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=12 April 2014|publisher=Bloomberg Markets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil sands industry may build a series of up to thirty lakes by pumping water into old mine pits when they have finished excavation leaving toxic effluent at their bottoms and letting biological processes restore it to health. It is less expensive to fill abandoned open pit mines with water instead of dirt.&lt;ref name="Vanderklippe_lakes" /&gt; In 2012 the Cumulative Environmental Management Association (CEMA) described End Pit Lakes (EPL)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://cemaonline.ca/index.php/component/content/article/89-cema-news/press-releases/press-release-articles/196-press-release-cema-delivers-oilsands-mine-end-pit-lake-guidance-document-october-4-2012|date=4 October 2012|publisher=Cumulative Environmental Management Association (CEMA)|title=CEMA Delivers Oilsands Mine End Pit Lake Guidance Document|location=Fort McMurray, Alberta|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as

CEMA acknowledged that the "main concern is the potential for EPLs to develop a legacy of toxicity and thus reduce the land use value of the oil sands region in the future." Syncrude Canada was planning the first end pit lake in 2013 with the intention of "pumping fresh water over 40 vertical metres of mine effluent that it has deposited in what it calls 'base mine lake.'" [[David Schindler]] argued that no further end pit lakes should be approved until we "have some assurance that they will eventually support a healthy ecosystem."

== Population ==

The Athabasca oil sands are located in the northeastern portion of the Canadian province of Alberta, near the city of Fort McMurray. The area is only sparsely populated, and in the late 1950s, it was primarily a wilderness outpost of a few hundred people whose main economic activities included fur trapping and salt mining. From a population of 37,222 in 1996, the [[boomtown]] of Fort McMurray and the surrounding region (known as the [[Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo]]) grew to 79,810 people as of 2006, including a "shadow population" of 10,442 living in work camps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Estimated oil reserves ==
{{update|section|date=January 2013}}
The Alberta government's Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) estimated in 2007 that about {{convert|173|Goilbbl}} of crude bitumen were economically recoverable from the three Alberta oil sands areas based on then-current technology and price projections from the 2006 market prices of $62 per barrel for benchmark [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI), rising to a projected $69 per barrel.  This was equivalent to about 10% of the estimated {{convert|1700|Goilbbl}} of bitumen-in-place.&lt;ref name="reserve"&gt;

These estimates of Canada's [[oil reserves|reserves]] were doubted when they were first published but are now largely accepted by the international oil industry.  This volume placed Canadian proven reserves second in the world behind those of Saudi Arabia.

Only 3% of the initial established crude bitumen reserves have been produced since commercial production started in 1967. At rate of production projected for 2015, about {{convert|3|Moilbbl/d}}, the Athabasca oil sands reserves would last over 170 years.&lt;ref&gt;

By 2007 this need in northern Alberta drove unemployment rates in Alberta and adjacent British Columbia to the lowest levels in history.  As far away as the Atlantic Provinces, where workers were leaving to work in Alberta, unemployment rates fell to levels not seen for over one hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Venezuela]]n [[Orinoco Belt#Orinoco Oil Sands|Orinoco Oil Sands]] site may contain more oil sands than Athabasca. However, while the Orinoco deposits are less viscous and more easily produced using conventional techniques (the Venezuelan government prefers to call them "extra-heavy oil"), they are too deep to access by surface mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/news/2016/2/15/why-venezuela-is-albertas-biggest-competitor|title=Why Venezuela is Alberta's biggest competitor|work=Oil Sands Magazine|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==

Despite the large reserves, the cost of extracting the oil from bituminous sands has historically made production of the oil sands unprofitable—the cost of selling the extracted crude would not cover the direct costs of recovery; labour to mine the sands and fuel to extract the crude.
[[File:Oil Prices Medium Term.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Oil prices 1996–2008 (not adjusted for inflation)]]

In mid-2006, the National Energy Board of Canada estimated the operating cost of a new mining operation in the Athabasca oil sands to be &lt;!-- CAD(2005) for production costs --&gt;C$9 to C$12 per barrel, while the cost of an in-situ [[SAGD]] operation (using dual horizontal wells) would be C$10 to C$14 per barrel.&lt;ref name="NEB2006"/&gt;
This compares to operating costs for conventional oil wells which can range from less than one dollar per barrel in Iraq and Saudi Arabia to over six in the United States and Canada's conventional oil reserves.

The capital cost of the equipment required to mine the sands and haul it to processing is a major consideration in starting production.  The NEB estimates that capital costs raise the total cost of production to C$18 to C$20 per barrel for a new mining operation and C$18 to C$22 per barrel for a SAGD operation.  This does not include the cost of upgrading the crude bitumen to synthetic crude oil, which makes the final costs C$36 to C$40 per barrel for a new mining operation.

Therefore, although high crude prices make the cost of production very attractive, sudden drops in price leaves producers unable to recover their capital costs—although the companies are well financed and can tolerate long periods of low prices since the capital has already been spent and they can typically cover incremental operating costs.

However, the development of commercial production is made easier by the fact that exploration costs are very low. Such costs are a major factor when assessing the economics of drilling in a traditional oil field. The location of the oil deposits in the oil sands are well known, and an estimate of recovery costs can usually be made easily.  There is not another region in the world with energy deposits of comparable magnitude where it would be less likely that the installations would be [[Confiscation|confiscated]] by a hostile national government, or be endangered by a [[war]] or [[revolution]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

As a result of the [[oil price increases since 2003]], the economics of oil sands have improved dramatically.  At a world price of US$50 per barrel, the NEB estimated an integrated mining operation would make a rate return of 16 to 23%, while a SAGD operation would return 16 to 27%.  Prices since 2006 have risen, exceeding US$145 in mid-2008 but falling back to less than 40 US$ as a result of the worldwide financial crisis, the oil price recovered slowly and many of the planned projects (expected to exceed C$100 billion between 2006 and 2015) were stopped or scheduled. In 2012 and 2013 the oil price was high again, but the US production is increasing due to new technologies, while the gasoline demand is falling, so there is an overproduction of oil. But recovering economy can change this in a few years.

At present the area around Fort McMurray has seen the most effect from the increased activity in the oil sands. Although jobs are plentiful, housing is in short supply and expensive.  People seeking work often arrive in the area without arranging accommodation, driving up the price of temporary accommodation.  The area is isolated, with only a two-lane road, [[Alberta Highway 63]], connecting it to the rest of the province, and there is pressure on the government of Alberta to improve road links as well as hospitals and other infrastructure.&lt;ref name="NEB2006"&gt;

== Geopolitical importance ==

The Athabasca oil sands are often a topic in international trade talks, with energy rivals [[China]] and the United States negotiating with Canada for a bigger share of the rapidly increasing output. Production is expected to quadruple between 2005 and 2015, reaching {{convert|4|Moilbbl|m3}} a day, with increasing political and economic importance. Currently, most of the oil sands production is exported to the United States.

An agreement has been signed between [[PetroChina]] and [[Enbridge]] to build a {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} pipeline from [[Edmonton]], Alberta, to the west coast port of [[Kitimat, British Columbia]]. If it is built, the pipeline will help export synthetic crude oil from the oil sands to China and elsewhere in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_April_14/ai_n13609601 |title=Enbridge and PetroChina Sign Gateway Pipeline Cooperation Agreement &amp;#124; Business Wire &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=2005-04-14 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2011, First Nations and environmental groups protested the proposed pipeline, stating that its construction and operation would be destructive to the environment. First Nations groups also claim that the development of the proposed pipeline is in violation of commitments that the Government of Canada has made through various Treaties and the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2011/05/11/calgary-protest-northern-gateway-aboriginal.html|title=First Nations group protests pipeline proposal |accessdate=6 June 2011 |date=2011-05-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720035745/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2011/05/11/calgary-protest-northern-gateway-aboriginal.html| archivedate= 20 July 2011 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller pipeline will also be built alongside to import condensate to dilute the bitumen. [[Sinopec]], the largest refining and chemical company in China, and [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] have bought or are planning to buy shares in major oil sands development.

On August 20, 2009, the U.S. State Department issued a presidential permit for an [[Alberta Clipper Pipeline]] that will run from [[Hardisty, Alberta|Hardisty]], [[Alberta]] to [[Superior, Wisconsin]].

== Indigenous peoples of the area ==

[[Indigenous peoples of North America|Indigenous peoples]] of the area include the [[Fort McKay First Nation]].  The oil sands themselves are located within the boundaries of [[Treaty 8]], signed in 1899, which states:
{{quote|It does not appear likely that the conditions of the country on either side of the Athabasca and Slave Rivers or about Athabasca Lake will be so changed as to affect hunting or trapping, and it is safe to say that so long as the fur-bearing animals remain, the great bulk of the Indians will continue to hunt and to trap.|Treaty 8}}

{{quote|We had to solemnly assure them that only such laws as to hunting and fishing as were in the interest of the Indians and were found necessary in order to protect the fish and fur-bearing animals would be made, and that they would be as free to hunt and fish after the treaty as they would be if they never entered into it. (…) It does not appear likely that the conditions of the country on either side of the Athabasca and Slave Rivers or about Athabasca Lake will be so changed as to affect hunting or trapping, and it is safe to say that so long as the fur-bearing animals remain, the great bulk of the Indians will continue to hunt and to trap.|The Honourable Clifford Sifton, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs|Report of Commissioners for Treaty No. 8, Winnipeg, Manitoba, September 22, 1899}}

The Fort McKay First Nation has formed several companies to service the oil sands industry and will be developing a mine on their territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=b4d4fc1c-49cf-4980-9864-c994de05e53a&amp;k=3443 Financial Post Article]— Aboriginal implication in the project&lt;/ref&gt;
Opposition remaining within the First Nation focuses on environmental stewardship, land rights, and health issues, like [http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2009/02/06/edm-fort-chip-cancer.html elevated cancer rates in Fort Chipewyan] and [http://www.edmontonsun.com/news/alberta/2010/09/16/15374696.html deformed fish being found by commercial fishermen in Lake Athabasca.]

The Alberta Cancer Board published research of the cancer rates of those living in Fort Chipewyan, Alberta in 2009. While many companies argue that there are not enough chemicals and toxic material in the water due to the development of the oil sands, this report indicates that there is coincidentally a significantly higher rate of cancer within this community. There have been many speculations as to why there is a higher rate of cancer in this community; some of those speculations are contamination with the river and the oil sands as well as uranium mining that is currently in progress. The world’s largest production of uranium is produced in this area as well as along the Athabasca River, allowing for easy contamination of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cancer incidence in Fort Chipewyan, Alberta 1995-2006 |author= Chen, Yiqun |publisher= Alberta Cancer Board, Division of Population Health and Information Surveillance |place= Edmonton, AB |url= http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/files/rls-2009-02-06-fort-chipewyan-study.pdf }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of oil sands and pipeline development on Indigenous groups ==
Pipeline development poses significant risks to the cultural, social, and economic way of life of Canada’s Indigenous populations. Historically, many Indigenous groups have opposed pipeline development for two primary reasons: 1) the inherent environmental risks associated with transporting harmful oil and gas products, and 2) failure by the federal government to properly consider and mitigate Indigenous groups’ concerns regarding resource development on their lands. For instance, many Indigenous groups rely heavily on local wildlife and vegetation for their survival.  Increased oil production in Canada requires greater oil transport through their traditional lands, which poses serious threats to the survival and traditional way of life of Indigenous groups, as well as the safety and preservation of the surrounding ecosystems. As well, First Nation's in Alberta have called particular attention to adverse health impacts related to oil sands emissions, asserting that the water quality testing for specific chemicals (heavy metals) has been insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Droitsch|first=Danielle|last2=Simieritsch|first2=Terra|date=2010|title=Canadian Aboriginal Concerns with Oil Sands|url=https://www.pembina.org/reports/briefingnoteosfntoursep10.pdf|journal=Pembina Institute|publisher=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from environmental concerns, many Indigenous groups have pushed back against pipeline development due to inadequate consultation processes by the federal government. As per Section 35 of the Canadian Constitution Act&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution Act, 1982, Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous peoples in Canada are guaranteed the right to be meaningfully consulted with and accommodated when the Crown is contemplating resource development on their lands - see [[Duty to consult and accommodate|Duty to Consult]]. Through a series of Supreme Court of Canada rulings and political protests from Indigenous peoples (see [[Haida Nation v British Columbia (Minister of Forests)|Haida Nation v. British Columbia [Minister of Forests]]], Taku River Tlingit First Nation v British Columbia, and [[Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia|Tsilhqot’in Nation v British Columbia)]], among others, the courts have attempted to further define the Crown’s consultation responsibilities and give legal recognition to Indigenous traditional territory and rights regarding resource development.

Contrarily, oil sands development also presents many positive impacts and opportunities for Indigenous groups, particularly in Western Canada.  In fact, over the past two decades, First Nations participation in the energy sector has increased dramatically, from employment and business opportunities to project approval processes and environmental evaluation. Increased Indigenous participation has been encouraged by numerous collaboration agreements with industry, typically in the form of impact benefit agreements (IBAs), which provide not only employment and business ventures, but also job training and community benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Coates, K. (2016). First Nations Engagement in the Energy Sector in Western Canada. ''Prepared for the Indian Resource Council. h''http://www.irccanada.ca/sites/default/files/First%20Nations%20Engagement%20in%20the%20Energy%20Sector%20in%20Western%20Canada.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Enhanced participation in the energy sector has empowered many Indigenous groups to push for wider involvement by negotiating ownership stakes in proposed pipelines and bitumen storage projects. Perhaps the best example of such partnering in Alberta is the agreement between [[Suncor Energy|Suncor]] and [[Fort McKay]] and [[Mikisew Cree First Nation]]s. The two First Nations acquired a 49% ownership in Suncor’s East Tank Farm Development with shares valued at about $500 million making it the largest business investment to date by a First Nation entity in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Suncor (2017, November 22). Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree First Nations complete purchase of 49 per cent interest in Suncor’s East Tank Farm Development. ''Suncor News Releases.'' &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.suncor.com/newsroom/news-releases/2170192&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for resource development and desire for direct involvement is further illustrated by the First Nations’ led $17-billion Eagle Spirit Energy Holding Ltd. pipeline and energy corridor between Alberta and the northern B.C. coast (with a back-up plan to site its terminal in Alaska to get around the tanker ban in B.C.). The project has secured support from 35 First Nations along the proposed route; the bands are entitled to at least 35% ownership in exchange for the land use.&lt;ref&gt;Nickel, R. and Williams, N.

== Oil sand companies ==

[[File:Athabasca Oil Sands Planned Production.png|thumb|right|480px|Planned mining operation oil production by various companies. Data from table below.]]
There are currently three large oil sands mining operations in the area run by [[Syncrude]] Canada Limited, [[Suncor Energy]] and [[Albian Sands]] owned by Shell Canada, Chevron, and Marathon Oil Corp.

Major producing or planned developments in the Athabasca Oil Sands include the following projects:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oilsandsdiscovery.com/oil_sands_story/pdfs/projects.pdf Oil Sands Projects ''Oilsands Discovery''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328175332/http://www.oilsandsdiscovery.com/oil_sands_story/pdfs/projects.pdf |date=2006-03-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Suncor Energy]]'s Steepbank and Millennium mines currently produce {{convert|263000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} and its Firebag in-situ project produces {{convert|35000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}. It intends to spend 3.2 billion to expand its mining operations to {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} and its in-situ production to {{convert|140000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} by 2008.
* [[Syncrude]]'s Mildred Lake and Aurora mines currently can produce {{convert|360000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}.
* [[Shell Canada]] currently operates its [[Albian Sands|Muskeg River Mine]] producing {{convert|155000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} and the [[Scotford Upgrader]] at [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]]. Shell intends to open its new Jackpine mine and expand total production to {{convert|500000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} over the next few years.
* [[Nexen]]'s in-situ Long Lake SAGD project is now producing {{convert|70000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}.  Plans to expand it to {{convert|240000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} have been made.  Expansion plans were delayed in early 2009.
* [[CNRL]]'s $8 billion Horizon mine is planned to produce {{convert|110000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} on startup in mid-2009 and grow to {{convert|300000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} by 2010.
* [[Total S.A.]]'s subsidiary Deer Creek Energy was operating a SAGD project on its Joslyn lease, producing {{convert|10000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}. It intended on constructing its mine by 2010 to expand its production by {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}, however this had not occurred by May 2014 when the company shelved the project while it reviewed the economic viability of the project.&lt;ref name="TotalJoslyn"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cost escalation leads Total to put Joslyn oil sands project on hold|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/business/layoff+talk+swirls+Total+update+Joslyn+oilsands+status/9888984/story.html|accessdate=14 June 2014|publisher=[[Edmonton Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Imperial Oil]]'s 4.6 billion barrel [[Kearl Oil Sands Project]] is projected to start construction in 2008 and produce {{convert|110000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} by the end of 2012. Imperial also operates a {{convert|160000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in-situ operation in the [[Cold Lake (Alberta)|Cold Lake]] oil sands region.
* Synenco Energy and SinoCanada Petroleum Corp., a subsidiary of [[Sinopec]], China's largest oil refiner, had agreed to create the 3.5 billion Northern Lights mine, projected to produce {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} by 2009.  This project has since been indefinitely deferred (as of 2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synenco.com/pdf/Q3_2007_Conf_Transcript.pdf Synenco conference transcript].&lt;/ref&gt;
* North American Oil Sands Corporation (NAOSC), a subsidiary of [[Statoil]], is expected to produce in the Kai Kos Dehseh project around {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} by 2015. It is expected to ramp up production to around {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} by around 2015.&lt;ref name="fp"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4612">'''Calendering''' of [[textiles]] is a [[finishing (textiles)|finishing]] process used to smooth, coat, or thin a material.  With textiles, fabric is passed between [[calender]] rollers at high temperatures and pressures. Calendering is used on fabrics such as [[moire (fabric)|moire]] to produce its watered effect and also on [[cambric]] and some types of [[sateen]]s.

In preparation for calendering, the fabric is folded lengthwise with the front side, or face, inside, and stitched together along the edges.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Textiles |last= Harmuth|first= Louis|year= 1915|publisher= Fairchild publishing company|page= 106|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LVEhAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="record"/&gt; The fabric can be folded together at full width, however this is not done as often as it is more difficult.&lt;ref name="record"/&gt; The fabric is then run through rollers that polish the surface and make the fabric smoother and more lustrous.&lt;ref name="term"&gt;{{cite book |title= Textiles Technology|last= Cresswell|first= Lesley|author2=Barbara Lawler |author3=Helen Wilson |author4=Susanna Watkins |year= 2002|publisher= Heinemann|isbn= 0-435-41786-X|page= 36|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mjbp-RcxI1gC&amp;dq|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; High temperatures and pressure are used as well.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite book |title= Textile World Record|year= 1907|publisher= Lord &amp; Nagle Co.|page= 118|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfbNAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fabric"&gt;{{cite book |title= Fabric Magic|last= Paine|first= Melanie|year= 1999|publisher= Frances Lincoln ltd|isbn=0-7112-0995-2 |page= 24 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AkWAMNeLI6MC&amp;dq|accessdate= July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabrics that go through the calendering process feel thin, glossy and papery.&lt;ref name="record"/&gt;

The wash durability of a calendared finish on thermoplastic fibers like polyester is higher than on cellulose fibers such as cotton. On blended fabrics such as Polyester/Cotton the durability depends largely on the proportion of synthetic fiber component present as well as the amount and type of finishing additives used and the machinery and process conditions employed.

==Variations==
Several different finishes can be achieved through the calendering process by varying different parts. The main different types of finishes are ''beetling'', ''watered'', ''embossing'' and ''Schreiner''.&lt;ref name="textiles"/&gt;

===Beetled===
Beetling is a finish given to [[cotton]] and [[linen]] cloth, and makes it look like [[satin]]. In the beetling process the fabric goes over wooden rollers and is beaten with wooden hammers.&lt;ref name="textiles"&gt;{{cite book |title= Textiles|last= Nystrom|first= Paul Henry|year= 1916|publisher= D. Appleton|pages= 274–275|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=z5YUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watered===
The watered finish, also known as [[moire (fabric)|moire]], is produced by using ribbed rollers. These rollers compress the cloth and the ribs produce the characteristic watermark effect by moving aside threads as well as compressing them.&lt;ref name="record"/&gt;&lt;ref name="term"/&gt; This leaves some of the threads round while others get compressed and become flat.&lt;ref name="textiles"/&gt;

===Embossed===
In the [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]] process the rollers have engraved patterns on them, and the patterns become stamped onto the fabric.&lt;ref name="textiles"/&gt; The end result is a raised or sunken pattern, depending on the roller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Home Economics in Action|author=Caribbean Association Staff, Theadora Alexander, Caribbean Association of Home Economists|year= 2002|publisher= Heinemann|isbn= 0-435-98048-3|page= 129|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W_h3CZlJnlcC&amp;pg=RA1-PA129&amp;dq|accessdate= July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This works best with soft fabrics.&lt;ref name="textiles"/&gt;

===Schreiner===
Similar to the watered process, in the Schreiner process the rollers are ribbed, only in the Schreiner process the ribs are very fine, with as many as six hundred ribs per inch under extremely high pressure. The threads are pressed flat with little lines in them, which causes the fabric to reflect the light better than a flat surface would. Cloth finished with the Schreiner method has a very high lustre, which is made more lasting by heating the rollers.&lt;ref name="textiles"/&gt;

'''''Carbon Nation''''' is a 2010 documentary film by [[Peter Byck]] about technological- and community-based energy solutions to the growing worldwide [[carbon footprint]].  The film is narrated by [[Bill Kurtis]].  ASIN: B0055T46LA (Rental) and B0055T46G0 (Purchase).

Rather than highlighting the problems with use of fossil fuels, ''Carbon Nation'' presents a series of ways in which the [[energy use|16 terawatts of energy]] the world consumes can be met while reducing or eliminating carbon-based sources.  It contains optimistic interviews with experts in various fields, business CEOs, and [[sustainable energy]] supporters to present a compelling case for change while having a neutral, matter-of-fact explanation.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/kentucky/press/press4509.html|title=Carbon Nation|date=May 6, 2010|publisher=[[The Nature Conservancy]] |accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those interviewed are [[Richard Branson]], former [[CIA]] Director [[R. James Woolsey]], Earth Day founder [[Denis Hayes]] and environmental advocate [[Van Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-carbon-nation-review-story,0,6885208.story |title=Movie review: 'Carbon Nation' |author=Gary Goldstein |date=February 17, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1451">'''Chappell Hayes''' (1949–1994) was a political activist in West [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].

Hayes campaigned against polluting industries in West Oakland. Hayes fought against reconstruction of the [[Cypress Street Viaduct]] through the center of West Oakland, forced the port to spend millions on environmental initiatives and helped get like-minded residents elected to organizations throughout the Bay Area.

West Oakland's [[McClymonds High School]]'s on-campus health clinic is named in his honor.

Hayes was married to Oakland City Council member and 2006 mayoral candidate [[Nancy Nadel]].

Commonly of [[Bronze Age]] origins, these cairns may be part of a cairnfield (a collection of closely spaced cairns) where some cairns might be funerary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durham-pa.gov.uk/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PGlossary?readform&amp;GLOSSARY=clearance+cairns Keys to the Past Glossary.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68614 English Heritage Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912124019/http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68614 |date=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearance cairns are a worldwide phenomenon wherever organised agriculture has been practised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PtUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=clearance+cairns&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QVXw2Um-V9&amp;sig=XnLom3YjVvZ4GYAOFhlh0JiwEeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Clearance cairns in Palestine.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of clearance ==
[[File:AncientPlough.jpg|thumb|left|Single-handled [[ard_(plough)|ard]]]]
[[File:Mouldboard plough.JPG|thumb|A reconstructed mould board plough.]]
By removing large and moderate size stones from the surface and sub-surface, ploughing can take place with much less potential damage taking place to the plough blade. Stones also prevent the growth of plants where they physically block access to the soil and their removal allows for a greater surface area for crops to grow and to allow for plants to grow to their full potential; Stones also increase drainage and may therefore deprive plants of moisture. Stones were removed from fields to allow for the efficient use of hand tools, animal powered machines on such fields in the past and for tractors, etc. in more recent times. Some prehistoric clearance cairns may also contain burials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timetrail.warwickshire.gov.uk/searchglossary.aspx?term=clearance%20cairn Warwickshire Time Trail]&lt;/ref&gt; A few clearance cairns may have been additionally created as boundary markers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/cairns_moor.htm The Cairns of Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; As ploughing developed and specialised the greater depth tilled and the increased power of mechanised [[ploughing]] resulted in more and larger stones being brought to the surface and these too had to be removed.
[[File:Bellfield walled garden.JPG|thumb|A typical [[walled garden]] where the stone acts as a slow release radiator]]
Field clearance cairns sometimes survive long after cleared fields have fallen out of use and are often the only surviving evidence of past agricultural activity in areas of woodland, upland areas, etc.  The existence of these cairns was once regarded as suggesting pastoral farming.  Many now consider them the result of arable or mixed agricultural exploitation enabling ploughing or hand tillage to work more efficiently.

=== Heat radiation ===
The possibility exists that the stone piles were built in the middle of the enclosures, with an additional purpose of maximising the effects of daytime radiance; the holding in of heat caught during the day, and its release at night would increase the temperature of the field very slightly. This effect would encourage crop growth and reduce the risk of frost.&lt;ref name="Archaeology of Pembrokeshire"&gt;[http://www.envf.port.ac.uk/geo/research/carningli/archaeology.htm Archaeology of Pembrokeshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508151602/http://www.envf.port.ac.uk/geo/research/carningli/archaeology.htm |date=2009-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walled gardens produce the same effect.

== Creation ==
[[File:Eglinton mound feature.JPG|thumb|A mound associated with a bog-wood and a clearance cairn at [[Eglinton Country Park]].]]
[[File:Bog-wood Eglinton.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bog-wood]] associated with a clearance cairn.]]
Many clearance stones were used in the construction of defensive structures, houses, farm buildings, walls, drainage ditches, road metalling, etc. Where permanent clearance cairns were formed it was predominately on waste land, such as steep slopes, edges of woodland, field corners, and around earth-fast boulders.

The amount of stone which needed to be cleared from fields depended upon the local geology, glacial deposits, glacial erratics, etc. Many cairns are mainly composed of stones which could have been carried by a single person who would have followed the plough as it turned up small boulders, etc.
Some surviving cairns are of considerable antiquity as field clearance has been practised since the beginnings of agriculture in the Stone Age, such as at the [[Gardberg site]] in [[Vestre Slidre]], [[Oppland]], [[Norway]]. A [[Bronze Age]] origin for clearance cairns is more common.&lt;ref name="Archaeology of Pembrokeshire"/&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Plough marks 2.JPG|thumb|Ard or plough-marks on a boulder in a clearance cairn]]
[[File:Plough marks.JPG|left|thumb|Ard-marks on a boulder in a clearance cairn at [[Eglinton Country Park]]]]
[[File:Mechanised clearance cairn.JPG|thumb|A clearance cairn formed using mechanised extraction]]
[[File:Recent Clearance Cairn.JPG|left|thumb|A recent clearance cairn devoid of lichen and moss growth]]
Cairns may be discrete, in large groups (cairnfields) or as linear formations—linear cairns. Many stones in clearance cairns show plough-marks or [[Ard (plough)|ard-marks]] at various angles to each other, typical of the Bronze Age ploughing methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/archaeology/research/cladh-hallan/cladh-hallan02.html Ard-marks at Cladh Hallan]&lt;/ref&gt; These ard-marks indicate that the boulders were obstructing the ploughing process and were in situ for some time before removal.

Other items such as  [[bog-wood]] and grubbed out tree stumps were sometimes added to the cairns as a result of tree felling and the process of creation of pasture from woodland. Bog-wood stumps and trunks can be thousands of years old, are darker in colour due to the [[tannin]]s from the peat and do not show typical wood decomposition characteristics due to their preservation within peat bogs. The absence of saw marks indicates felling using axes, providing further information about the age of the wood involved.

Some clearance cairns are linear in form. Many of the smaller cairns were probably created by family groups, whilst larger ones would have required organised labour.&lt;ref name="Cairns1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PtUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=clearance+cairns&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QVXw2Um-V9&amp;sig=XnLom3YjVvZ4GYAOFhlh0JiwEeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Construction of cairns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairnfields have on occasions been confused with various other classes of monuments, such as round barrow cemeteries and groups of [[round barrow]]s, stone [[hut circle]]s, [[ring cairn]]s, or [[burnt mound]]s. In general round barrows are larger, more regular, and may contain visible traces of a cist or kerb; stone hut circles have distinct entrances; ring cairns have a hollow centre; and burnt mounds contain a high proportion of fire-crazed stones of rather smaller size than appear in the average clearance cairns within cairnfields.

Natural deposits such as so called 'clitter agglomerates',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm Clitter cairns.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605235806/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; moraines can also on occasion look rather similar to groups of clearance cairns, but their context, position and regular form usually betrays their true origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm Monument Class descriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605235806/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearance cairn material is often heterogeneous, typically consisting of both edged and rounded small stones, sometimes mixed with sand, clay or silt, lifted from the field nearby. Agricultural and clearance cairns are sometimes located on slopes, whilst burial cairns rarely are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514268024/html/c589.html Burial Cairns in Finland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearance cairns constructed using mechanised methods with horse or motor powered assistance may appear superficially similar, however the stones are generally much larger and they are more randomly tipped rather than hand placed.

== Natural history ==
Due to the age and 'abandoned' state of many clearance cairns they are often good sites for the growth and survival of lichens, mosses, ferns and other plants; the actual species being dependent on the rock type. Cairns are relatively undisturbed and emulate old walls for the micro-habitats they produce.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723055822/http://www.brrhoen.de/en/23-plants Plants on cairns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landscape history ==
In some areas which are now unproductive moorland, aerial photographs show the presence of numerous prehistoric clearance cairns and associated dwellings such as hut-circles. This clear evidence of previous ancient habitation and cultivation shows that the climate worsened until the farmers were forced to move to lower ground.&lt;ref name="Wickham-Jones"&gt;Wickham-Jones, C. R. (2009), ''The Landscape of Scotland''. Stroud : The History Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-1484-3}}. pp. 48 – 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stone carrying ==
[[Lifting stone|Stone carry]] or the stone walk is a traditional Scottish athletic event involving the carrying of large stones down the field of competition; the competitors pick up two heavy stones with iron handles, and carry the pair as far as they can. The sport may have grown out of the act of clearing stones from fields to create pastures and arable land.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2903">'''Climax Uranium Mill''' is a decommissioned [[uranium]] mill near [[Grand Junction, CO]].

The mill, that processed vanadium as well as uranium, was incorporated May 11, 1950. It was constructed on city-owned property next to the Colorado River which was once the Grand Junction sugar beet mill. Climax Uranium Company gutted the former sugar beet mill, removing any remaining equipment and stabilizing weak walls, and began uranium and [[vanadium]] milling operations. The mill soon grew to be 12 buildings large and processed 2 million tons of ore, mostly for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]].&lt;ref name="rmoa"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://ahc.uwyo.edu/usearchives/inventories/html/wyu-ah09832.html#d0e73| title = Inventory of the Climax Uranium Mill records, 1942-1976| accessdate = 2011-01-26| year = 2006| work = Rocky Mountain Online Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decommissioning==
From the early 1950s to 1966, Climax donated approximately 300,000 tons of radioactive [[uranium tailings]] to the city of Grand Junction for use as a construction material.&lt;ref name=Grammer&gt;{{Citation|last1 =Grammer|first1=Elisa J.|title = The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 and NRC's Agreement State Program|journal = ''Natural Resources Lawyer''|volume = 13|issue = 3|pages = 469–522 [481]|year = 1981|jstor =40922651|ref=Grammer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tailings were used in sewer and road construction. In 1972, Congress gave the Atomic Energy Commission authority to cooperate with Grand Junction in a cleanup operation, with the federal government covering 75% of the project's cost.{{sfn|Grammer|1981|479}}

The mill was decommissioned in 1970 under the [[US Department of Energy|US Department of Energy's]] [[Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action]] project.&lt;ref name="doe"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.em.doe.gov/bemr/BEMRSites/gjus.aspx|title= Grand Junction, Colorado (Umtra Site)| accessdate = 2012-12-17|publisher=Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clui.org/ludb/site/grand-junction-climax-uranium-mill-site|accessdate=December 17, 2012|publisher=The Center for Land Use Interpretation|title=GRAND JUNCTION CLIMAX URANIUM MILL SITE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mill site was designated for [[environmental remediation]] by the [[Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act]] in 1978.{{sfn|Grammer|1981|479}}

==Restoration==
The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] published a Remedial Action Plan for the site in 1994, and the removal of 4.5 million cubic yards of contaminated materials from the site to a disposal cell was completed that spring.&lt;ref name=doe/&gt; Reseeding and wetlands establishment was completed in August 1994.

'''Come By Chance Refinery''' (also known as '''North Atlantic Refinery''') is a crude oil refinery located in [[Come By Chance, Newfoundland and Labrador|Come By Chance]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]].  It has a refinery capacity of {{convert|130000|oilbbl/d}}.  It is operated by [[North Atlantic Refining]] and was owned by [[Korea National Oil Corporation]] until 2014, when SilverRange Capital Partners, a New-York Based commodity merchant bank, bought the refinery.  SilverRange is now Silverpeak Strategic Partners.

==History==
The refinery was built by [[John Shaheen]]'s Shaheen Resources in 1971–1973. It was operated in 1973–1976 until the bankruptcy of Shaheen Resources. The refinery was restarted in 1986 by Newfoundland Processing Ltd. In August 1994, the [[Vitol|Vitol Group]] purchased the refinery and the operating company North Atlantic Refining was founded. In October 2006, [[Calgary]]-based [[Harvest Energy Trust]] purchased North Atlantic Refining for $1.6&amp;nbsp;billion, and in October 2009, the company was purchased by [[Korea National Oil Corporation]]. The refinery was expanded to a capacity of 130,000 bbl after a revamp by Silverpeak in 2016. &lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26083">'''Custody Transfer''' in the [[oil and gas industry]] refers to the transactions involving transporting physical substance from one operator to another. This includes the transferring of raw and refined [[petroleum]] between tanks and tankers; tankers and ships and other transactions. Custody transfer in [[flow measurement|fluid measurement]] is defined as a metering point (location) where the fluid is being measured for sale from one party to another. During custody transfer, [[accurate|accuracy]] is of great importance to both the company delivering the material and the eventual recipient, when transferring a material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/custody-transfer-value-good-measurement-and-search-truth |title=Custody Transfer: The Value Of Good Measurement And The Search For The Truth |accessdate=10 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106141744/http://pipelineandgasjournal.com/custody-transfer-value-good-measurement-and-search-truth |archive-date=2011-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "fiscal metering" is often interchanged with custody transfer, and refers to metering that is a point of a commercial transaction such as when a change in ownership takes place. Custody transfer takes place any time fluids are passed from the possession of one party to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controleng.com/index.php?id=483&amp;cHash=081010&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=39535 |title=Custody Transfer: Flowmeter As Cash Register |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Custody transfer generally involves:
* Industry standards;
* National metrology standards;
* Contractual agreements between custody transfer parties; and
* Government regulation and taxation.

Due to the high level of accuracy required during custody transfer applications, the [[flowmeters]] which are used to perform this are subject to approval by an organization such as the [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API).
Custody transfer operations can occur at a number of points along the way; these may include operations, transactions or transferring of [[oil]] from an [[oil production]] platform to a ship, barge, railcar, truck and also to the final destination point, such as a [[Oil refinery|refinery]].

==Metering methods==
Custody transfer is one of the most important applications for [[flow measurement]]. Many flow measurement technologies are used for custody transfer applications; these include [[Pressure sensor|differential pressure (DP) flowmeters]], [[Flow measurement|turbine flowmeters]], [[Positive displacement meter|positive displacement flowmeters]], [[Coriolis flow meter|Coriolis flowmeters]] and [[ultrasonic flow meter|ultrasonic flowmeters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emersonprocessxperts.com/archives/applications/custody_transfe/ |title=Custody Transfer Flow Measurement |accessdate=10 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709131303/http://www.emersonprocessxperts.com/archives/applications/custody_transfe/ |archivedate=9 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential pressure flowmeters===
[[Pressure sensor|Differential pressure (DP) flowmeters]] are used for the ''custody transfer'' of liquid and gas to measure the flow of liquid, gas, and steam. The DP flowmeter consist of a differential [[pressure transmitter]] and a primary element. The primary element places a constriction in a flow stream, while the DP transmitter measures the difference in pressure [[Upstream (petroleum industry)|upstream]] and [[Downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] of the constriction.

In many cases, pressure transmitters and primary elements are bought by the end-users from different suppliers.  However, several vendors have integrated the pressure transmitter with the primary element to form a complete flowmeter.  The advantage of this is that they can be calibrated with the primary element and DP transmitter already in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/energy-demand-propels-custody-transfer-flow-measurement|title=Energy Demand Propels Custody Transfer Flow Measurement|accessdate=10 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106091214/http://pipelineandgasjournal.com/energy-demand-propels-custody-transfer-flow-measurement|archive-date=2011-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standards and criteria for the use of DP flowmeters for custody transfer applications are specified by the [[American Gas Association]] (AGA) and the [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API).

An advantage of using a DP flowmeters is that they are the most studied and best understood type of flowmeter. A disadvantage of using a DP flowmeters is that they introduce a pressure drop into the flowmeter line. This is a necessary result of the constriction in the line that is required to make the DP flow measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omega.co.uk/literature/transactions/volume4/T9904-07-DIFF.html|title=Flow and Level Measurement |accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important development in the use of DP flowmeters for custody transfer applications has been the development of single and dual chamber [[Orifice plate|orifice]] fittings.

===Turbine flowmeters===
The first [[Flow measurement|turbine flowmeter]] was invented by Reinhard Woltman, a German engineer in 1790. Turbine flowmeters consist of a rotor with propeller-like blades that spins as water or some other fluid passes over it. The rotor spins in proportion to flow rate (see [[Gas meter|turbine meters]]) . There are many types of turbine meters, but many of those used for gas flow are called '''axial meters'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.custodytransfer.com/|title=The World Market for Custody Transfer of Natural Gas |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The turbine flowmeter is most useful when measuring clean, steady, high-speed flow of [[Viscosity|low-viscosity fluids]]. In comparison to other flowmeters, the turbine flowmeter has a significant cost advantage over [[ultrasonic flow meter|ultrasonic flowmeters]], especially in the larger line sizes, and it also has a favourable price compared to the prices of DP flowmeters, especially in cases where one turbine meter can replace several DP meters.

The disadvantage of turbine flowmeters is that they have moving parts that are subject to wear. To prevent wear and inaccuracy, durable materials are used, including ceramic [[ball bearing]]s.

===Positive displacement flowmeters===
[[Positive displacement meter|Positive displacement (PD) flowmeters]] are highly accurate meters that are widely used for custody transfer of [[commerce|commercial]] and [[industry|industrial]] water, as well as for custody transfer of many other liquids. PD flowmeters have the advantage that they have been approved by a number of regulatory bodies for this purpose, and they have not yet been displaced by other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowcontrolnetwork.com/measurement/flowmeters/article/considering-traditional-technology-flowmeters |title=Considering Traditional Technology Flowmeters |author=Jesse Yoder Phd |accessdate=10 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728132929/http://www.flowcontrolnetwork.com/measurement/flowmeters/article/considering-traditional-technology-flowmeters |archivedate=28 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PD meters excel at measuring low flows, and also at measuring highly [[Viscosity|viscous flows]], because PD meters captures the flow in a container of known volume. [[Speed]] of flow doesn’t matter when using a PD meter.

===Coriolis flowmeters===

[[Coriolis flow meter|Coriolis flowmeters]] have been around for more than 30 years and are preferred in process industries such as [[chemical]] and [[food]] and [[beverage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.instrumentation.co.za/article.aspx?pklArticleId=4551&amp;pklCategoryId=59|title=Custody transfer of oil products with Coriolis mass flowmeters |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coriolis technology offers accuracy and reliability in measuring material flow, and is often hailed as among the best flow measurement technologies due to direct mass flow, fluid density, temperature, and precise calculated volume flow rates.  Coriolis meters do not have any moving parts and provide long term stability, repeatability, and reliability.  Because they are direct mass flow measurement devices, Coriolis meters can handle the widest range of fluids from gases to heavy liquids and are not impacted by viscosity or density changes that often effect velocity based technologies (PD, Turbine, Ultrasonic).  With the widest flow range capability of any flow technology, Coriolis can be sized for low pressure drop.  This combined with the fact that they are not flow profile dependent helps eliminate the need for straight runs and flow conditioning which enables custody transfer systems to be designed with minimal pressure drop. 

It has to be mentioned that any measurement instrument that relies on one measurement principle only will show a higher [[measurement uncertainty]] under two-phase flow conditions. Conventional measurement principles, like [[positive displacement meter|positive displacement]], [[turbine meters]], [[orifice plates]] will seemingly continue to measure, but will not be able to inform the user about the occurrence of two-phase flow. Yet modern principles based on the [[Coriolis effect]] or [[ultrasonic flow]] measurement will inform the user by means of diagnostic functions.

Flow is measured using Coriolis meters by analyzing the changes in the Coriolis force of a flowing substance. The force is generated in a mass moving within a rotating frame of reference. An angular, outward [[acceleration]], which is factored with linear [[velocity]] is produced due to the rotation. With a fluid mass, the Coriolis force is proportional to the mass flow rate of that fluid.

A Coriolis meter has two main components: an oscillating flow tube equipped with [[sensors]] and drivers, and an electronic [[transmitter]] that controls the oscillations, analyzes the results, and transmits the information. The Coriolis principle for [[flow measurement]] requires the [[oscillating]] section of a rotating pipe to be exploited. Oscillation produces the Coriolis force, which traditionally is sensed and analyzed to determine the rate of flow. Modern coriolis meters utilize the phase difference measured at each end of the oscillating pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pump-zone.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;task=emailform&amp;id=732|title=Digital Coriolis Flowmeters in Oil and Gas Custody Transfer |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultrasonic flowmeters===
[[ultrasonic flow meter|Ultrasonic flowmeters]] were first introduced into industrial markets in 1963 by '''''Tokyo Keiki''''' (now Tokimec) in Japan. Custody transfer measurements have been around for a long time, and over the past ten years, Coriolis and ultrasonic meters have become the flowmeters of choice for custody transfer in the [[oil and gas industry]].

Ultrasonic meters provide volumetric flow rate. They typically use the transit-time method, where sounds waves transmitted in the direction of fluid flow travel faster than those travelling upstream. The transit time difference is proportional to fluid velocity. Ultrasonic flow meters have negligible pressure drop if recommended installation is followed, have high turndown capability, and can handle a wide range of applications. Crude oil production, transportation, and processing are typical applications for this technology.

The use of ultrasonic flowmeters is continuing to grow for custody transfer. Unlike PD and turbine meters, ultrasonic flowmeters do not have moving parts.  Pressure drop is much reduced with an ultrasonic meter when compared to PD, turbine, and DP meters.  Installation of ultrasonic meters is relatively straightforward, and maintenance requirements are low.

In June 1998, The [[American Gas Association]] published a standard called AGA-9. This standard lays out the criteria for the use of [[ultrasonic flow meter|Ultrasonic flowmeters]] for Custody Transfer of [[Natural Gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowresearch.com/articles/PDF_Files/FC-0108-FA.pdf|title=Ultrasonic Flowmeters for Custody Transfer |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

Custody transfer requires an entire metering system that is designed and engineered for the application, not just flowmeters. Components of a custody transfer system typically include: 
* Multiple meters/meter runs;
* [[Flow computer]]s;
* [[Quality system]]s (gas chromatographs to measure energy content of natural gas and sampling systems for liquid);
* [[Calibration]] using in-place or mobile provers for liquid, or master-meter for liquid or gas; and
* Supporting automation.
A typical liquid custody transfer skid includes multiple [[flowmeters]] and meter provers. Provers are used to calibrate meters in-situ and are performed frequently; typically before, during, and after a batch transfer for metering assurance. A good example of this is a [[Lease_automatic_custody_transfer_unit|Lease Automatic Custody Transfer(LACT) unit]] in a crude oil production facility.

==Accuracy==

In the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 5725-1 standard accuracy for measuring instruments is defined as “the closeness of agreement between a test result and the accepted reference value”. This term “accuracy” includes both the systematic [[error]] and the bias component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giignl.org/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/A_PUBLIC_INFORMATION/Publications/GIIGNL-LNG_CUSTODY_TRANSFER_HANDBOOK_-_3rd_edtion_-_final_2010-03-26.pdf |title=LNG CUSTODY TRANSFER HANDBOOK |accessdate=10 April 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each device has its manufacturer stated accuracy [[specification]] and its tested accuracy. [[Uncertainty]] takes all the metering system factors that impact measurement accuracy into account. The accuracy of flowmeters could be used in two different metering systems that ultimately have different calculated uncertainties due to other factors in the system that affect flow calculations. Uncertainty even includes such factors as the flow computer's [[A/D]] converter accuracy. The quest for accuracy in a custody transfer system requires meticulous attention to detail.

==Custody transfer requirements==

Custody transfer metering systems must meet requirements set by industry bodies such as [[American Gas Association|AGA]], [[American Petroleum Institute|API]], or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], and national metrology standards such as [[OIML]] (International), [[NIST]] (U.S.), [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|PTB]] (Germany), CMC (China), and [[GOST]] (Russia), among others. These requirements can be of two types: [[Legal]] and [[Contract]].

===Legal===

The national Weights &amp; Measures codes and regulations control the wholesale and retail trade requirements to facilitate fair trade. The regulations and accuracy requirements vary widely between countries and commodities, but they all have one common characteristic - “[[traceability]]”. There is always a procedure that defines the validation process where the duty meter is compared to a standard that is traceable to the [[Metrology|legal metrology]] agency of the respective region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.smithmeter.com/literature/docs/tpls002.pdf|title=Proving Liquid Ultrasonic Flow Meters for Custody Transfer Measurement |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract===

A [[contract]] is a written agreement between buyers and sellers that defines the measurement requirements. These are large-volume sales between operating companies where refined products and [[Petroleum|crude oils]] are transported by [[Marine (ocean)|marine]], [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] or [[Rail transport|rail]]. Custody transfer measurement must be at the highest level of accuracy possible because a small error in measurement can amount to a large financial difference. Due to these critical natures of measurements, [[Petroleum industry|petroleum companies]] around the world have developed and adopted standards to meet the industry's needs.

In Canada, for instance, all measurement of a custody transfer nature falls under the purview of [[Measurement Canada]].  In the USA, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) controls the standards which must be met for interstate trade.

==Liquid custody transfer==

Custody transfer of liquid flow measurement follow guidelines set by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. By industrial consensus, liquid flow measurement is defined as having an overall [[uncertainty]] of ±0.25% or better.  The overall uncertainty is derived from an appropriate statistical combination of the component uncertainties in the measurement system.

===Mode of measurement===

====Volume or mass measurement====

Liquid flow measurements are usually in volumetric or mass unit. Volume is normally used for stand-alone field tanker loading operations, while mass is used for multi-field pipeline or offshore pipeline with an allocation requirement.

Mass measurement and reporting are achieved by
* Measurement of volume flow rate (for example, by turbine or ultrasonic meter) and fluid density
* Direct mass measurement by Coriolis meter

====Sampling system====

An automatic flow-proportional sampling system is used in flow measurement to determine the average water content, average density and for analysis purposes. Sampling systems should be broadly in accordance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 3171.
The sampling system is a critical section during flow measurement. Any errors introduced through sampling error will generally have a direct, linear effect on the overall measurement.

====Temperature and pressure measurement====

Temperature and pressure measurement are important factors to consider when taking flow measurements of liquids. Temperature and pressure measurement points should be situated as close to the meter as possible, in reference to their conditions at the meter inlet. Temperature measurements that affect the accuracy of the metering system should have an overall loop accuracy of 0.5°C or better, and the corresponding readout should have a resolution of 0.2°C or better.

Temperature checks are performed by certified [[thermometers]] with the aid of [[Thermowell]]s

Pressure measurements that affect the accuracy of the metering system should have an overall loop accuracy of 0.5 bar or better and the corresponding readout should have a resolution of 0.1 bar or better.

==Gaseous custody transfer==
Custody transfer of gaseous flow measurement follow guidelines set by the [[International Organization for Standardization|international bodies]]. By industrial consensus, gaseous flow measurement is defined as mass flow measurement with an overall uncertainty of ±1.0% or better.  The overall uncertainty is derived from an appropriate statistical combination of the component uncertainties in the measurement system.

===Mode of measurement===

====Volume or mass unit====

All gaseous flow measurement must be made on single-phase gas streams, having measurements in either volumetric or mass units.

====Sampling====

Sampling is an important aspect, as they help to ascertain accuracy. Apt facilities should be provided for the purpose of obtaining representative samples. The type of instrumentation and the measuring system may influence this requirement.

====Gas density====
Gas [[density]] at the meter may be determined either by:
* Continuous direct measurement, by on-line [[densitometer]]
* Calculation, using a recognised equation of state together with measurements of the gas temperature, pressure and composition.
Most industries prefer to use the continuous measurement of gas density. However, both methods may be used simultaneously, and the comparison of their respective results may provide additional confidence in the accuracy of each method.

==Best practices==

In any custody transfer application, a true random [[uncertainty]] has an equal chance of favouring either party, the net impact should be zero to both parties, and measurement accuracy and repeatability should not be valued. Measurement accuracy and repeatability are of high value to most seller because many users install check meters.
The first step in designing any custody transfer system is to determine the mutual measurement performance expectations of the supplier and the user over the range of flow rates. This determination of mutual performance expectations should be made by individuals who have a clear understanding of all of the costs of measurement disputes caused by poor repeatability.
The second step is to quantify the operating conditions which are not controllable. For a flow measurement, these can include:
* Expected ambient [[temperature]] variation;
* Maximum static line [[pressure]];
* Static line pressure and temperature variation;
* Maximum allowable permanent pressure loss;
* Flow turndown; and
* Expected [[frequency]] of flow variation and/or pulsation.
The third and final step is to select hardware, installation and maintenance procedures which will ensure that the measurement provides the required installed performance under the expected (uncontrollable) operating conditions. For example, the user can:
* Select a static and/or differential pressure transmitter which has better or worse performance under the given real-world operating conditions.
* Calibrate the transmitter(s) frequently or infrequently.
* In the case of a DP flowmeter, size the primary element for a higher or lower differential pressure (higher DP's provide higher accuracy, at the expense of higher pressure loss).
* Select a flowmeter and pressure transmitter with faster or slower response.
* Use long or short interconnection (impulse) lines, or direct connect for fastest response.
While the first and second steps involve gathering data, the third step may require calculations and/or testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3251/is_7_228/ai_n25035483/pg_3/?tag=content;col1|title=Calculating Natural Gas Custody Transfer Flow Measurements |accessdate=10 April 2011 | work=Pipeline &amp; Gas Journal | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General formula for calculating energy transferred (LNG)==
The formula for calculating the [[LNG]] transferred depends on the contractual sales conditions. These can relate to three types of sale contract as defined by [[Incoterms]] 2000: an [[FOB (shipping)|FOB sale]], a [[Incoterm|CIF]] sale or a [[Incoterm|DES]] sale. 

In the case of an '''[[FOB (shipping)|FOB]]''' (Free On Board) sale, the determination of the energy transferred and invoiced for will be made in the loading port. 

In the case of a '''[[Incoterm|CIF]]''' (Cost Insurance &amp; Freight) or a '''[[Incoterm|DES]]''' (Delivered Ex Ship) sale, the [[energy]] transferred and invoiced for will be determined in the unloading port. 

In [[FOB (shipping)|FOB]] contracts, the buyer is responsible to provide and maintain the custody transfer measurement systems on board the vessel for volume, temperature and pressure determination and the seller is responsible to provide and maintain the custody transfer measurement systems at the loading terminal such as the sampling and gas analysis. For [[Incoterm|CIF]] and [[Incoterm|DES]] contracts the responsibility is reversed. 

Both buyer and seller have the right to verify the accuracy of each system that is provided, maintained and operated by the other party. 
The determination of the transferred energy usually happens in the presence of one or more surveyors, the ship’s cargo officer and a representative of the [[LNG]] terminal operator. A representative of the buyer can also be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giignl.org/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/A_PUBLIC_INFORMATION/Publications/GIIGNL-LNG_CUSTODY_TRANSFER_HANDBOOK_-_3rd_edtion_-_final_2010-03-26.pdf |title=LNG CUSTODY TRANSFER HANDBOOK |accessdate=10 April 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all cases, the transferred energy can be calculated with the following formula: 

'''''E =(VLNG × DLNG × GVCLNG) - Egas  displaced ± Egas to ER (if applicable)'''''

Where: 

'''''E''''' = the total net energy transferred from the loading facilities to the [[LNG]] carrier, or from the LNG carrier to the unloading facilities.
 
'''''VLNG'''''= the volume of [[LNG]] loaded or unloaded in m3.
 
'''''DLNG''''' = the density of [[LNG]] loaded or unloaded in kg/m3.
 
'''''GCVLNG''''' = the gross calorific value of the LNG loaded or unloaded in [[British thermal unit|MMBTU/kg]]

'''''E gas  displaced''''' = The net energy of the displaced gas, also in [[British thermal unit|MMBTU]], which is either: 
	sent back onshore by the [[LNG]] carrier when loading (volume of gas in cargo tanks displaced by same volume of loaded [[LNG]]),
	Or, [[gas]] received by the [[LNG]] carrier in its cargo tanks when unloading in replacement of the volume of discharged [[LNG]]. 

'''''E(gas to ER)''''' = If applicable, the [[energy]] of the gas consumed in the [[LNG]] carrier’s engine room during the time between opening and closing custody transfer surveys, i.e. used by the vessel at the port, which is:

''+ For an [[LNG]] loading transfer'' or 

''- For an [[LNG]] unloading transfer''

'''Death Valley''' is a desert valley located in [[Eastern California]], in the northern [[Mojave Desert]] bordering the [[Great Basin Desert]]. It is one of the [[Highest temperature recorded on Earth|hottest places in the world]] at the height of summertime along with deserts in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/world-heat-record-overturneda-personal-account.html|title=World Heat Record Overturned – A Personal Account|publisher=WunderBlog|accessdate=24 October 2016|quote=Consequently, the WMO assessment is that the official highest recorded surface temperature of 56.7°C (134°F) was measured on 10 July 1913 at Greenland Ranch (Death Valley) CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located near the border of California and Nevada, in the [[Great Basin]], east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains, Death Valley constitutes much of [[Death Valley National Park]] and is the principal feature of the [[Mojave and Colorado Deserts Biosphere Reserve]]. It is located mostly in [[Inyo County, California]]. It runs from north to south between the [[Amargosa Range]] on the east and the [[Panamint Range]] on the west; the [[Grapevine Mountains]] and the [[Owlshead Mountains]] form its northern and southern boundaries, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Death Valley National Monument: Proposed Natural and Cultural Resources Management Plan and Draft Environmental Impact Statement|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior|year=1981|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUM3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has an area of about {{convert|3,000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=JW|editor-last=Wright|year=2006|title=The New York Times Almanac|edition=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-14-303820-6|page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point in Death Valley itself is [[Telescope Peak]] in the Panamint Range, which has an elevation of {{Convert|11043|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hiking Death Valley National Park|first1=Bill|last1=Cunningham|first2=Polly|last2=Cunningham|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2016|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death Valley is an excellent example of a [[graben]], or a downdropped block of land between two mountain ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geology Underfoot in Death Valley and Owens Valley|first1=RP|last1=Sharp|first2=AF|last2=Glazner|publisher=Mountain Press Publishing|year=1997|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It lies at the southern end of a geological [[trough (geology)|trough]] known as [[Walker Lane]], which runs north to Oregon. The valley is bisected by a right lateral strike slip [[fault (geology)|fault]] system, represented by the [[Death Valley Fault]] and the [[Furnace Creek Fault]]. The eastern end of the left lateral [[Garlock Fault]] intersects the Death Valley Fault. Furnace Creek and the [[Amargosa River]] flow through the valley but eventually disappear into the sands of the valley floor.

Death Valley also contains [[salt pan (geology)|salt pans]]. According to current geological consensus, at various times during the middle of the [[Pleistocene]] era, which ended roughly 10,000–12,000 years ago, an inland lake referred to as [[Lake Manly]] formed in Death Valley. Lake Manly was nearly {{convert|100|mi|km}} long and {{convert|600|ft|m}} deep, the end-basin in a chain of lakes that began with Mono Lake in the north and continued through multiple basins down the Owens River Valley through Searles and China Lakes and the Panamint Valley to the immediate west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Image of the Day: Lake Badwater, Death Valley|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=37536&amp;src=eoa|publisher=NASA|work=Earth Observing System|date=18 March 2009|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the area turned to desert, the water evaporated, leaving the abundance of evaporitic salts such as common sodium salts and [[borax]], which were later exploited during the modern history of the region, primarily 1883 to 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Celeste Cosby |author2=Jeanette Hawkins |author3=Jani Kushla |author4=Molly Robinson |title=Boron Minerals of Death Valley |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317215452/http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Geology/dv/Boron/home.html |archivedate=17 March 2008 |publisher=Clark Science Center, Smith College |year=2009 |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Geology/dv/Boron/home.html#History |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Death Valley has a [[subtropical]], [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BWh''), with long, extremely hot summers and  short, mild winters, as well as little rainfall. As a general rule, lower altitudes tend to have higher temperatures. When the sun heats the ground, that heat is then radiated upward, but the dense below-sea-level air [[greenhouse effect|absorbs some of this radiation]] and radiates some of it back towards the ground. In addition, the high valley walls trap rising hot air and recycle it back down to the valley floor, where it is heated by compression.&lt;ref name="visit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Weather and Climate Death Valley National Park|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/planyourvisit/upload/Weather%20and%20Climate.pdf|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|date=July 2007|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process is especially important in Death Valley, as it provides its specific climate and geography. The valley is surrounded by mountains, while its surface is mostly flat and devoid of plants, so much of the sun's heat can reach the ground, absorbed by soil and rock. When air at ground level is heated, it begins to rise, moving up past steep, high mountain ranges, which then cools slightly, sinking back down towards the valley more compressed. This air is then reheated by the sun to a higher temperature, moving up the mountain again, whereby the air moves up and down in a circular motion in cycles, similar to how a [[convection oven]] works. This heated air increases ground temperature markedly, forming the hot wind currents that are trapped by atmospheric pressure and mountains, thus stays mostly within the valley. Such hot wind currents contribute to perpetual drought-like conditions in Death Valley and prevent much cloud formation from passing through the confines of the valley, where precipitation is often in the form of a [[virga]].&lt;ref name="weather"&gt;{{cite web|work=Death Valley National Park|title=Weather and Climate|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/naturescience/weather-and-climate.htm|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|date=23 May 2008|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death Valley holds temperature records because it has an unusually high number of factors that lead to high atmospheric temperatures.

The depth and shape of Death Valley influence its summer temperatures. The valley is a long, narrow basin {{convert|282|ft|m}} below sea level, yet is walled by high, steep mountain ranges. The clear, dry air and sparse plant cover allow sunlight to heat the desert surface. Summer nights provide little relief, as overnight lows may only dip into the {{convert|82|to|98|F|C}} range. Moving masses of super-heated air blow through the valley creating extremely high temperatures.&lt;ref name="National Park Service"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Park Service|work=Death Valley|title=Weather and Climate|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/planyourvisit/upload/Weather%20and%20Climate.pdf|publisher=NPS.gov|accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Death Valley received four times its average annual rainfall of {{convert|1.5|in|mm}}. As it has done before for hundreds of years, the lowest spot in the valley filled with a wide, shallow lake, but the extreme heat and aridity immediately began evaporating the [[ephemeral lake]].

The pair of images (seen at right) from NASA's [[Landsat 5]] satellite documents the short history of Death Valley's [[Lake Badwater]]: formed in February 2005 (top) and evaporated by February 2007 (bottom). In 2005, a big pool of greenish water stretched most of the way across the valley floor. By May 2005 the valley floor had resumed its more familiar role as [[Badwater Basin]], a salt-coated [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]]. In time, this freshly dissolved and recrystallized salt will darken.

The western margin of Death Valley is traced by [[alluvial fan]]s. During [[flash flood]]s, rainfall from the steep mountains to the west pours through narrow canyons, picking up everything from fine clay to large rocks. When these torrents reach the mouths of the canyons, they widen and slow, branching out into distributary channels. The paler the fans, the younger they are.

==Ecology==
[[File:Death Valley Gerea canescens.jpg|thumb|Death Valley in 2005 springtime bloom]]
In spite of the overwhelming heat and sparse rainfall, Death Valley exhibits considerable biodiversity. Wildflowers, watered by snowmelt, carpet the desert floor each spring, continuing into June.&lt;ref name="NPR.org"/&gt; Bighorn sheep, red-tailed hawks, and wild burros may be seen. Death Valley has over 600 springs and ponds. Salt Creek, a mile-long shallow depression in the center of the valley, supports pupfish.&lt;ref name="Sean Lema 2008"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/the-phenotypic-plasticity-of-death-valleys-pupfish/1|title=Phenotypic Plasticity of Death Valley's Pupfish|first=Sean|last=Lema|magazine=American Scientist|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These isolated pupfish populations are remnants of the wetter Pleistocene climate.&lt;ref name="Sean Lema 2008"/&gt;

[[Darwin Falls]], on the western edge of Death Valley Monument, falls {{convert|100|ft|m}} into a large pond surrounded by willows and cottonwood trees. Over 80 species of birds have been spotted around the pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Not So Dead|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|date=May 2008|page=30|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/points-of-interest-37244965/|first1=Matt|last1=Kettmann|first2=Paul|last2=Grondahl|first3=Monica|last3=Watrous|first4=Nan|last4=Chase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Death Valley is home to the [[Timbisha]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], formerly known as the Panamint Shoshone, who have inhabited the valley for at least the past millennium. The Timbisha name for the valley, ''tümpisa'', means "rock paint" and refers to the [[red ochre]] paint that can be made from a type of [[clay]] found in the valley. Some families still live in the valley at Furnace Creek. Another village was in Grapevine Canyon near the present site of [[Scotty's Castle]]. It was called in the [[Timbisha language]] ''maahunu'', whose meaning is uncertain, although it is known that ''hunu'' means "canyon".
{{wide image|Zbriskie Point South Panorama 2012.jpg|680px|[[Badlands]] at [[Zabriskie Point]] in Death Valley}}

The valley received its English name in 1849 during the [[California Gold Rush]].

Death Valley National Monument was proclaimed on February 11, 1933, by President [[Herbert Hoover]], placing the area under federal protection. In 1994, the monument was redesignated as [[Death Valley National Park]], as well as being substantially expanded to include Saline and Eureka Valleys.

'''Dielectric heating''', also known as '''electronic heating''', '''RF (radio frequency) heating''', and '''high-frequency heating''', is the process in which a [[radio frequency]] alternating electric field, or [[radio wave]] or [[microwave]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] heats a [[dielectric]] material. At higher frequencies, this heating is caused by [[molecular dipole]] rotation within the dielectric.

RF dielectric heating at intermediate{{Clarify |Intermediate frequency |reason=Can be confused with [[Intermediate frequency]]. |date=January 2016}} frequencies, due to its greater penetration over microwave heating, shows greater promise than microwave systems as a method of very rapidly heating and uniformly preparing certain food items, and also killing parasites and pests in certain harvested crops.&lt;ref name="Piyasena-2003-pmid-14669879"&gt;{{citation |author=Piyasena P |title=Radio frequency heating of foods: principles, applications and related properties—a review |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. |year=2003 |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=587–606 |pmid=14669879 |doi=10.1080/10408690390251129|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}

[[Molecular]] rotation occurs in materials containing [[polar molecule]]s having an [[electrical dipole moment]], with the consequence that they will align themselves in an [[electromagnetic field]]. If the field is oscillating, as it is in an electromagnetic wave or in a rapidly oscillating electric field, these [[molecule]]s rotate continuously by aligning with it. This is called dipole rotation, or dipolar polarisation.  As the field [[alternating current|alternates]], the molecules reverse direction.  Rotating molecules push, pull, and collide with other molecules (through electrical forces), distributing the energy to adjacent molecules and [[atom]]s in the material. The process of energy transfer from the source to the sample is a form of radiative [[heat]]ing.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="homepages.ed.ac.uk"&gt;[http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/ah05/basicintro.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706231044/http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/ah05/basicintro.html |date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

[[Temperature]] is related to the average [[kinetic energy]] (energy of motion) of the atoms or molecules in a material, so agitating the molecules in this way increases the temperature of the material. Thus, dipole rotation is a mechanism by which energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation can raise the temperature of an object.  There are also many other mechanisms by which this conversion occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Yadish|title=Thermal Energy: Sources, Recovery, and Applications|publisher=CRC Press|location=Baton Rouge, FL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdArDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT902&amp;lpg=PT902&amp;dq=Temperature+is+related+to+the+average+kinetic+energy+(energy+of+motion)+of+the+atoms+or+molecules+in+a+material,+so+agitating+the+molecules+in+this+way+increases+the+temperature+of+the+material.+Thus,+dipole+rotation+is+a+mechanism+by+which+energy+in+the+form+of+electromagnetic+radiation+can+raise+the+temperature+of+an+object.+There+are+also+many+other+mechanisms+by+which+this+conversion+occurs.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fu3OOfjbBt&amp;sig=t_CU4MTL1hYKgjESzZ08y07uM7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3t5SAsYvaAhUW92MKHQUYAWQQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dipole rotation is the mechanism normally referred to as dielectric heating, and is most widely observable in the [[microwave oven]] where it operates most efficaciously on liquid [[water]], and also, but much less so, on [[fat]]s and [[sugar]]s. This is because fats and sugar molecules are far less [[chemical polarity|polar]] than water molecules, and thus less affected by the forces generated by the alternating electromagnetic fields. Outside of cooking, the effect can be used generally to heat [[states of matter|solids, liquids, or gases]], provided they contain some electric dipoles.

Dielectric heating involves the heating of electrically insulating materials by [[dielectric loss]]. A changing electric field across the material causes energy to be dissipated as the molecules attempt to line up with the continuously changing electric field. This changing electric field may be caused by an electromagnetic wave propagating in free space (as in a microwave oven), or it may be caused by a rapidly alternating electric field inside a capacitor. In the latter case, there is no freely-propagating electromagnetic wave, and the changing electric field may be seen as analogous to the electric component of an antenna [[near and far field|near field]]. In this case, although the heating is accomplished by changing the electric field inside the capacitive cavity at radio-frequency (RF) frequencies, no actual [[radio wave]]s are either generated or absorbed. In this sense, the effect is the direct electrical analog of [[electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] heating, which is also near-field effect (thus not involving radio waves).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Frequencies]] in the range of 10–100&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] are necessary to cause  dielectric heating, although higher frequencies work equally well or better, and in some materials (especially liquids) lower frequencies also have significant heating effects, often due to more unusual mechanisms. For example, in conductive liquids such as salt water, ''ion-drag'' causes heating, as charged ions are "dragged" more slowly back and forth in the liquid under influence of the electric field, striking liquid molecules in the process and transferring kinetic energy to them, which is eventually translated into molecular vibrations and thus into thermal energy.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Dielectric heating at low frequencies, as a near-field effect, requires a distance from electromagnetic radiator to absorber of less than {{sfrac|2{{pi}}}} ≈ {{sfrac|6}} of a wavelength. It is thus a contact process or near-contact process, since it usually sandwiches the material to be heated (usually a non-metal) between metal plates taking the place of the dielectric in what is effectively a very large [[capacitor]]. However, actual electrical contact is not necessary for heating a dielectric inside a capacitor, as the electric fields that form inside a capacitor subjected to a voltage do not require electrical contact of the capacitor plates with the (non-conducting) dielectric material between the plates. Because lower frequency electrical fields penetrate non-conductive materials far more deeply than do microwaves, heating pockets of water and organisms deep inside dry materials like wood, it can be used to rapidly heat and prepare many non-electrically conducting food and agricultural items, so long as they fit between the capacitor plates.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

At very high frequencies, the wavelength of the electromagnetic field becomes shorter than the distance between the metal walls of the heating cavity, or than the dimensions of the walls themselves. This is the case inside a [[microwave oven]]. In such cases, conventional far-field electromagnetic waves form (the cavity no longer acts as a pure capacitor, but rather as an antenna), and are absorbed to cause heating, but the dipole-rotation mechanism of heat deposition remains the same. However, microwaves are not efficient at causing the heating effects of low frequency fields that depend on slower molecular motion, such as those caused by ion-drag.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Power ==
Dielectric heating must be distinguished from [[Joule heating]] of conductive media, which is caused by induced electric currents in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pryor|first1=Roger|title=Modeling Dielectric Heating: A First Principles Approach|url=https://www.comsol.com/paper/download/259871/pryor_paper.pdf|publisher=Pryor Knowledge Systems, Inc.|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For dielectric heating, the generated power density per volume is given by:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \omega \cdot \varepsilon_\mathrm{r}'' \cdot \varepsilon_0 \cdot E^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is the [[angular frequency]] of the exciting radiation, ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;″ is the [[imaginary part]] of the complex relative [[permittivity]] of the absorbing material, ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the permittivity of free space and ''E'' the [[electric field strength]].  The imaginary part of the (frequency-dependent) relative permittivity is a measure for the ability of a dielectric material to convert electromagnetic field energy into heat.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

If the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] ''σ'' of the material is small, or the frequency is high, such that {{nowrap|''σ'' ≪ ''ωε''}} (with {{nowrap|''ε'' {{=}} ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;″ · ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}), then dielectric heating is the dominant mechanism of loss of energy from the electromagnetic field into the medium.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Penetration ==
Microwave frequencies penetrate conductive materials, including semi-solid substances like [[meat]] and living tissue, to a distance defined by the [[skin effect]]. The penetration essentially stops where all the penetrating microwave energy has been converted to heat in the tissue. Microwave ovens used to heat food are not set to the frequency for optimal absorption by water. If that were so, then the piece of food or liquid in question would absorb all microwave radiation in its outer layer, leading to a cool, unheated centre and a superheated surface. Instead, the frequency selected allows energy to penetrate deeper into the heated food. The frequency of a household microwave oven is 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz, while the frequency for optimal absorbency by water is around 10&amp;nbsp;GHz.

== Radio-frequency (RF) heating ==

The use of high-frequency electric fields for heating dielectric materials had been proposed in the 1930s. For example, {{US patent|2147689}} (application by Bell Telephone Laboratories, dated 1937) states "''This invention relates to heating systems for dielectric materials and the object of the invention is to heat such materials uniformly and substantially simultaneously throughout their mass. It has been proposed therefore to heat such materials simultaneously throughout their mass by means of the dielectric loss produced in them when they are subjected to a high voltage, high frequency field.''"  This patent proposed radio frequency (RF) heating at 10 to 20 [[megahertz]] (wavelength 15 to 30 meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2147689}}. [http://ip.com/pat/US2147689 Method and apparatus for heating dielectric materials - J.G. Chafee]&lt;/ref&gt; Such wavelengths were far longer than the cavity used, and thus made use of near-field effects and not electromagnetic waves. (Commercial microwave ovens use wavelengths only 1% as long.)

In agriculture, RF dielectric heating has been widely tested and is increasingly used as a way to kill pests in certain food crops after harvest, such as walnuts still in the shell. Because RF heating can heat foods more uniformly than is the case with microwave heating, RF heating holds promise as a way to process foods quickly.&lt;ref name="Piyasena-2003-pmid-14669879"/&gt;

In [[medicine]], the RF heating of body tissues, called [[diathermy]], is used for muscle therapy&lt;ref&gt;"Diathermy", [[Collins English Dictionary]] - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition. Retrieved August 29, 2013, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/diathermy Dictionary.com website]&lt;/ref&gt;  Heating to higher temperatures, called [[hyperthermia therapy]], is used to kill cancer and tumor tissue.

==Microwave heating==
[[Image:Microwave tunnel closeup.jpg|thumb|In addition to heating food, microwaves are widely used for heating in many industrial processes.  An industrial microwave tunnel oven for heating plastic parts prior to extrusion.]]

Microwave heating, as distinct from RF heating, is a sub-category of dielectric heating at frequencies above 100&amp;nbsp;MHz, where an electromagnetic wave can be launched from a small dimension emitter and guided through space to the target. Modern [[microwave oven]]s make use of electromagnetic waves with electric fields of much higher frequency and shorter wavelength than RF heaters. Typical domestic microwave ovens operate at [[ISM band|2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz]], but [[ISM band|915&amp;nbsp;MHz]] ovens also exist. This means that the wavelengths employed in microwave heating are 0.1&amp;nbsp;cm to 10&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Electromagnetic Spectrum|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum2.html|website=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Astronaut's Toolbox|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides for highly efficient, but less penetrative, dielectric heating.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Although a capacitor-like set of plates can be used at microwave frequencies, they are not necessary, since the microwaves are already present as [[near and far field|far field]] type [[electromagnetism|EM]] radiation, and their absorption does not require the same proximity to a small antenna as does RF heating. The material to be heated (a non-metal) can therefore simply be placed in the path of the waves, and heating takes place in a non-contact process which does not require capacitative conductive plates.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Microwave volumetric heating===

[[Microwave volumetric heating]] is a commercially available method of heating liquids, suspensions, or solids in a continuous flow on an industrial scale. Microwave volumetric heating has a greater penetration depth, of up to {{convert|42|mm}}, which is an even penetration through the entire volume of the flowing product. This is advantageous in commercial applications where increased shelf-life can be achieved, with increased microbial kill at temperatures {{cvt|10|-|15 |C-change}} lower than when using conventional heating systems.

Application for microwave volumetic heating:
* [[Pasteurization]]
* [[Flash pasteurization]]
* [[Microwave chemistry]]
* [[sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]]
* [[Food preservation]]
* [[Biofuel]] production

==Food Application==
In drying of foods, dielectric heating is usually combined with conventional heating. It may be used to preheat the feed to a hot-air drier. By raising the temperature of the feed quickly and causing moisture to move to the surface, it can decrease the overall drying time. Dielectric heating may be applied part-way through the drying cycle, when the food enters the falling rate period. This can boost the rate of drying. If dielectric heating is applied near the end of hot-air drying it can also shorten the drying time significantly and hence increase the throughput of the drier. It is more usual to use dielectric heating in the later stages of drying. One of the major applications of RF heating is in the postbaking of biscuits. The objectives in baking biscuits are to produce a product of the right size, shape, color, and moisture content. In a conventional oven, reducing the moisture content to the desired level can take up a large part of the total baking time. The application of RF heating can shorten the baking time. The oven is set to produce biscuits of the right size, shape, and color, but the RF heating is used to remove the remaining moisture, without excessive heating of the already dry sections of the biscuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food Processing Technology: Principles and Practice|last=Fellows|first=P.J.|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-0-08-101907-8|location=United Kingdom|pages=826–827}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity of an oven can be increased by more than 50% by the use of RF heating. Postbaking by RF heating has also been applied to breakfast cereals and cereal-based baby foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brennan |first1=J.G. |title= DRYING {{!}} Dielectric and Osmotic Drying |journal= Encyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition (Second Edition) |date=2003 |pages=1938–1942 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food quality is maximized and better retained using electromagnetic energy than conventional heating. Conventional heating results in large disparity in temperature and longer processing times which can cause overprocessing on the food surface and impairment of the overall quality of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DATTA|first=ASHIM K.|last2=DAVIDSON|first2=P. MICHAEL|date=2000-11-01|title=Microwave and Radio Frequency Processing|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2000.tb00616.x|journal=Journal of Food Science|language=en|volume=65|pages=32–41|doi=10.1111/j.1750-3841.2000.tb00616.x|issn=1750-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electromagnetic energy can achieve higher processing temperatures in shorter times, therefore, more nutritional and sensory properties are conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food processing technology|last=Fellows|first=Peter|publisher=Woodheat publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-0-08-101907-8|location=|pages=813–840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doi Pha Hom Pok National Park''' ({{lang-th|อุทยานแห่งชาติดอยผ้าห่มปก}}), formerly known as '''Mae Fang National Park'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildbirdeco.net/topbird/birdsite_013.php Doi Pha Hom Pok National Park] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615025032/http://www.wildbirdeco.net/topbird/birdsite_013.php |date=June 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Doi Fa Hom Pok National Park''', is the northernmost [[List of national parks of Thailand|national park]] in [[Thailand]]. It straddles [[Fang District|Fang]], [[Mae Ai District|Mae Ai]], and [[Chai Prakan District]]s of [[Chiang Mai Province]]. The park covers 524&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the mountain area of the [[Daen Lao Range]], at the border with [[Myanmar]]. The tallest peak is [[Doi Pha Hom Pok]] at {{convert|2285|m}}, the second highest in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doi Phahompok National Park |url=http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style2/default.asp?npid=160&amp;lg=2 |website=National Parks of Thailand |accessdate=2016-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202952/http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style2/default.asp?npid=160&amp;lg=2 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doi Pha Hom Pok National Park is mostly covered with forest, where tree species such as ''[[Hopea odorata]]'' predominate with rare plant species such as ''[[Impatiens jurpioides]]'' and butterflies such as ''[[Meandrusa sciron]]''. Doi Lang, located within the park, is an excellent area for [[birdwatching]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707165650/http://birdlifetour.com/bwt_1_days_doilang.html Birdwatching in Thailand, Doi Lang]&lt;/ref&gt; At Fang Hot Springs, park HQ, are many hot mineral springs in a 10 rai area (16,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6838">An '''exotic atom''' is an otherwise normal [[atom]] in which one or more sub-atomic particles have been replaced by other particles of the same charge. For example, [[electron]]s may be replaced by other negatively charged particles such as [[muon]]s (muonic atoms) or [[pion]]s (pionic atoms).&lt;ref&gt;&amp;sect;1.8, ''Constituents of Matter: Atoms, Molecules, Nuclei and Particles'', Ludwig Bergmann, Clemens Schaefer, and Wilhelm Raith, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1997, {{ISBN|3-11-013990-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="as"&gt;[http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=YB000560 Exotic atoms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222044613/http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=YB000560 |date=2007-12-22 }}, AccessScience, McGraw-Hill.  Accessed on line September 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because these substitute particles are usually unstable, exotic atoms typically have very short lifetimes.

== Muonic atoms ==
In a ''muonic atom'' (previously called a ''mu-mesic'' atom, now known to be a misnomer as [[muon]]s are not [[meson]]s),&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8 Dr. Richard Feynman's Douglas Robb Memorial Lectures]&lt;/ref&gt; an electron is replaced by a [[muon]], which, like the electron, is a [[lepton]].  Since [[lepton]]s are only sensitive to [[weak interaction|weak]], [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] and [[gravity|gravitational]] forces, muonic atoms are governed to very high precision by the electromagnetic interaction.  

Since a muon is more massive than an electron, the [[Bohr model|Bohr orbits]] are closer to the nucleus in a muonic atom than in an ordinary atom, and corrections due to [[quantum electrodynamics]] are more important. Study of muonic atoms' [[energy level]]s as well as [[transition rate]]s from [[excited state]]s to the [[ground state]] therefore provide experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics.

[[Muon-catalyzed fusion]] is a technical application of muonic atoms.

== Hadronic atoms ==
A ''hadronic atom'' is an atom in which one or more of the [[atomic orbital|orbital electrons]] is replaced by a negatively charged [[hadron]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 3, ''Fundamentals in Hadronic Atom Theory'', A. Deloff, River Edge, New Jersey: World Scientific, 2003.  {{ISBN|981-238-371-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Possible hadrons include [[meson]]s such as the [[pion]] or [[kaon]], yielding a ''pionic atom'' or a ''kaonic atom'' (see [[Kaonic hydrogen]]), collectively called ''mesonic atoms''; [[antiproton]]s, yielding an ''antiprotonic atom''; and the {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Sigma-}} particle, yielding a {{Subatomic particle|Sigma-}} or ''sigmaonic atom''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 8, &amp;sect;16.4, &amp;sect;16.5, Deloff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12717284-600/ The strange world of the exotic atom], Roger Barrett, Daphne Jackson and Habatwa Mweene, ''New Scientist'', August 4, 1990.  Accessed on line September 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 180, ''Quantum Mechanics'', B. K. Agarwal and Hari Prakash, New Delhi: Prentice-Hall of India Private Ltd., 1997.  {{ISBN|81-203-1007-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike leptons, hadrons can interact via the [[strong force]], so the orbitals of hadronic atoms are influenced by [[nuclear force]]s between the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and the hadron.  Since the strong force is a short-range interaction, these effects are strongest if the atomic orbital involved is close to the nucleus, when the energy levels involved may broaden or disappear because of the absorption of the hadron by the nucleus.&lt;ref name="as" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ns" /&gt;  Hadronic atoms, such as pionic hydrogen and [[kaonic hydrogen]], thus provide experimental probes of the theory of strong interactions, [[quantum chromodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29759 Exotic atoms cast light on fundamental questions], ''CERN Courier'', November 1, 2006.  Accessed on line September 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Onium==
{{main|Onium}}

An ''onium'' (plural: ''onia'' {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}) is the bound state of a particle and its antiparticle. The classic onium is [[positronium]], which consists of an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] bound together as a long-lived [[metastable]] state. Positronium has been studied since the 1950s to understand bound states in [[quantum field theory]]. A recent development called [[non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics]] (NRQED) used this system as a proving ground.

[[Pionium]], a bound state of two oppositely-charged [[pion]]s, is useful for exploring the [[strong interaction]]. This should also be true of [[protonium]], which is a proton-antiproton bound state. Understanding bound states of pionium and protonium is important in order to clarify notions related to [[exotic hadron]]s such as [[mesonic molecules]] and [[pentaquark]] states. [[Kaonium]], which is a bound state of two oppositely charged kaons, has not been observed experimentally yet.

The true analogs of positronium in the theory of strong interactions, however, are not exotic atoms but certain [[meson]]s, the ''[[quarkonium]] states'', which are made of a heavy quark such as the [[charm quark|charm]] or [[bottom quark]] and its antiquark. ([[Top quark]]s are so heavy that they decay through the [[weak force]] before they can form bound states.) Exploration of these states through non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) and [[lattice QCD]] are increasingly important tests of [[quantum chromodynamics]].

[[Muonium]], despite its name, is ''not'' an onium containing a muon and an antimuon, because IUPAC assigned that name to the system of an antimuon bound with an electron. However, the production of a muon/antimuon bound state, which is an onium, has been theorized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090529112609.htm] DOE/SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (2009, June 4). ''Theorists Reveal Path To True Muonium – Never-seen Atom.'' ScienceDaily. Retrieved June 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypernuclear atoms==
{{Main|Hypernucleus}}
Atoms may be composed of electrons orbiting a [[hypernucleus]] that includes [[strange quark|strange]] particles called [[hyperon]]s. Such [[hypernucleus|hypernuclear atoms]] are generally studied for their nuclear behaviour, falling into the realm of [[nuclear physics]] rather than [[atomic physics]].

==Quasiparticle atoms==
In [[condensed matter]] systems, specifically in some [[semiconductor]]s, there are states called [[exciton]]s which are bound states of an electron and an [[electron hole]].

'''Finngulf LNG''' was a [[liquefied natural gas]]terminal project in [[Ingå]], Finland. It was an initiative by Finnish natural gas company [[Gasum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gasum.com/gasnetwork/Pages/FinngulfLNG.aspx |title=Finngulf LNG |publisher=Gasum.com |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130723080328/http://www.gasum.com/gasnetwork/Pages/FinngulfLNG.aspx |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was on the list of projects submitted to be considered as potential EU projects of common interest in energy infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/infrastructure/consultations/doc/20120727_gas_with_marked_changes.pdf |accessdate=October 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221504/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/infrastructure/consultations/doc/20120727_gas_with_marked_changes.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the criteria for the EU aid is that the terminal must service more than one [[EU Member State]].&lt;ref name="europa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52011PC0658:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 52011PC0658 - EN|publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that another prerequisite was the proposed [[Balticconnector]] pipeline, which would connect Estonian and Finnish gas grids.

From the terminal, gas would be injected into the Finnish natural gas network or transported in the form of LNG for use as vessel fuel or for industrial uses. The terminal area would also include a large LNG storage tank.

An [[environmental impact assessment]] report for the terminal was completed in spring 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gasum.com/gasnetwork/Documents/Gasum_Finngulf_EIA_Summary.pdf |title=Finngulf LNG: Construction of liquefied natural gas terminal in Finland |publisher=Gasum |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109215743/http://www.gasum.com/gasnetwork/Documents/Gasum_Finngulf_EIA_Summary.pdf |archivedate=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full-scale terminal could be completed in 2018. In December 2013, the project management services contract was awarded to [[Neste Jacobs]].&lt;ref name=ct131213&gt;

[[File:The Green Dot.svg|thumb|200px|The Green Dot symbol]]

The '''Green Dot''' ({{lang-de|'''Der Grüne Punkt'''}}) is the license symbol of a European network of industry-funded systems for [[recycling]] the [[packaging material]]s of [[consumer good]]s. The [[logo]] is [[trademark]] protected worldwide.

==Concept==
The Green Dot was a system thought up by [[Klaus Töpfer]], Germany's environment minister in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/german-green-dot-recycling-system-under-threat/a-16939098 German Green Dot recycling system] Deutsche Welle 15.07.2013&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea of the Green Dot is that consumers who see the logo know that the manufacturer of the product contributes to the cost of recovery and recycling. This can be with household waste collected by the authorities (e.g. in special bags - in Germany these are yellow), or in containers in public places such as car parks and outside supermarkets.

The system is financed by the green dot licence fee paid by the producers of the products. Fees vary by country and are based on the material used in packaging (e.g. [[paper waste|paper]], [[plastic waste|plastic]], metal, wood, cardboard). Each country also has different fees for joining the scheme and ongoing fixed and variable fees. Fees also take into account the cost of collection, sorting and recycling methods.

In simple terms, the system encourages manufacturers to cut down on packaging as this saves them the cost of licence fees.

[[Image:4 PAO 12M 2007-07-12.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Black-and-white version of the "Der Grüne Punkt" DSD logo on a bottle of lotion, located between the [[PAO symbol]] and the [[resin identification code]] for [[LDPE]], next to an [[EAN-13]] barcode.]]

==German dual system of waste collection==
In 1991, the German government passed a packaging law (Verpackungsverordnung) that requires manufacturers to take care of the recycling or disposal of any packaging material they sell. As a result of this law, German industry set up a "[[public-private partnership|dual]] system" of [[waste collection]], which picks up household packaging in parallel to the existing [[municipal waste]]-collection systems. This industry-funded system is operated in Germany by the '''Duales System Deutschland''' GmbH (German for "Dual System Germany Ltd") corporation, or short DSD.

DSD only collects packaging material from manufacturers who pay a [[license fee]] to DSD. DSD license fee payers can then add the Green Dot logo to their package labeling to indicate that this package should be placed into the separate yellow bags or yellow [[wheelie bin]]s that will then be collected and emptied by DSD-operated [[waste collection vehicles]] and sorted (and where possible recycled) in DSD facilities.

German licence fees are calculated using the weight of packs, each material type used and the volumes of product produced per.

==Management==
Worldwide stewardship of the Green Dot logo is managed by PRO Europe (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pro-e.org/&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the various national Green dot organizations across Europe.

==Symbol design and confusion==
The design of the Green Dot symbol has obvious links with the Chinese [[Taijitu]] ([[yin and yang]]) symbol and [[Gary Anderson (Recycling)|Gary Anderson]]'s [[recycling symbol]]. Where full-color printing is available, its official form is printed in a light and a dark shade of green ([[Pantone]] 366C and 343C). For cost reasons or to avoid a visual clash with other symbols, many manufacturers chose a black-and-white or other color combination on their packages.

The Green Dot logo merely indicates that a company has joined the Green Dot scheme, and ''not'' necessarily that the package is fully [[recyclable]]. The logo is often confused with the [[recycling]] logo.

==Lawsuits==
In [[Malta]], Green Dot Malta Limited, a waste recovery company that is licensed from Der Grune Punkt Duales System Deutschland GmbH to use the Green Dot trademark in Malta, has successfully petitioned the Maltese courts on a number of occasions to protect the mark from free-riders and from competitors seeking to obtain unfair advantage from the international reputation and goodwill that it enjoys.

In February 2009, Smart Supermarket, a well established local supermarket based in [[Birkirkara]], [[Malta]], was ordered by a judge not to sell, manufacture or pack products bearing the trademark Green Dot without the necessary licenses. Green Dot Malta Limited had argued in court that the supermarket was not only blatantly infringing the trademark and contravening the Trademarks Act but was also taking unfair advantage of Green Dot's reputation and goodwill without having its authorisation. The First Hall of the Civil Court, presided over by Madam Justice Abigail Lofaro, upheld Green Dot Malta Limited's request and issued a warrant of prohibitory injunction. Lawyers Antoine Naudi and Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Following this injunction, the two parties reached an agreement whereby Smart Supermarket entered into a royalty license agreement with Green Dot Malta Limited and registered all its own branded food items such as confectionery and freshly packed products. they agreed to cooperate. The two companies also agreed to cooperate in ensuring that the intellectual property rights relating to the Green Dot mark in Malta will be further protected from any unlawful use by third parties including suppliers of the various goods to the supermarket.

In April 2009, following a similar request for an injunction filed by Green Dot Malta Limited, the company Zamco Caterware Limited declared in open court that it was binding itself not to circulate any products in the market with the Green Dot symbol on their packaging without the required license. The company also declared that it would not be importing any product bearing the Green Dot mark unless the relative royalty contributions have been paid and unless they prove that the imported product will be recycled in terms of applicable environmental legislation.

In September 2009, Karta Converters Limited, a company which produces and distributes articles made of paper, cardboard and plastic, was ordered by the First Hall of the Civil Court not to manufacture, pack, sell or otherwise continue circulating in the local market products bearing the trademark “Green Dot” without the necessary licenses. Presiding Judge Dr. Geoffrey Valencia accepted Green Dot Malta Limited’s assertion that the company was conducting itself as a “free-rider” in the local market and that it was taking an unjust and unfair advantage of Green Dot’s reputation without having its consent. Following this injunction, Karta Converters Limited issued a press release whereby it declared that it would be adopting the internationally recognised Green Dot symbol on its paper, carton and plastic products in accordance with the law. Karta Converters also declared that it would be joining some three hundred other companies participating in GreenPak, a waste recovery scheme operated by Green Dot Malta Limited, for the recycling of its packaging.

Out of court settlements have been reached on a number of occasions with various other Maltese companies to ensure that the international reputation of the mark is safeguarded.

In May 2010, Green Dot Malta Limited won a court case against Green.Mt Ltd, a local competitor which operates another waste recovery scheme in Malta. The latter was incorporated in 2007, a few years after Green Dot Malta Limited’s registration. Green Dot Malta Limited petitioned the Court to declare that the name Green.Mt Ltd amounted to unfair competition in terms of law since the use of the “.” coupled with the words “Green Mt” was intended to cause confusion in the market.

In delivering judgment, Mr. Justice Raymond Pace stated that the two schemes were obviously direct competitors operating in the same field of activity and that the name Green.Mt Ltd was creating confusion in terms of article 32 of Chapter 13 of the Laws of Malta. The court held that the law laid down that businesses could not use any name, mark or symbol which could create confusion with another name, mark or symbol used legally by others. The imitation did not need to be perfect. It was enough that in its entirety it could deceive a consumer. The Judge said that an examination of the words used left him in no doubt that the names could and indeed were creating confusion amongst consumers. The Court thus ordered Green.Mt Ltd to pay Green Dot Malta Limited a nominal sum by way of penalty and to destroy any offending material in its possession bearing the name Green.Mt Ltd within 30 days from date of judgment. Dr. Antoine Naudi and Dr. Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Before final judgment was delivered, Green.Mt Ltd changed its name to Green MT Ltd.

[[File:Axes-like grzywnas (commodity money) from Kostkowice, Poland, 9-mid X Century AD.jpg|thumb|Ax-like grzywnas from Kostkowice, Poland, 9th to mid-10th century AD]]
The '''grzywna''' (from [[Polish language|Polish]]) was a measure of weight, mainly for silver, commonly used throughout medieval central and eastern Europe, particularly in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] ({{lang-cz|hřivna}}).

Grzywna was also a unit of measure of a unit of exchange, and as such used as money in the 10th–15th centuries. Silver [[ingot]]s acted as [[commodity money]] before the widespread use of [[minted coin]]s. Several different grzywnas developed with their own system of weight and exchange, such as the Kulm grzywna and the [[Kraków]] grzywna.

==Etymology==

The name is derived from {{proto|slavic|grivĭna|necklace}} from {{proto|slavic|griva|neck, nape, mane}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brückner|first1=Aleksander|author-link=Aleksander Brückner|title=Słownik etymologiczny języka polskiego|date=1985|orig-year=1927|publisher=Wiedza Powszechna|location=Warszawa|page=163|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kraków grzywna==
The Kraków grzywna, used in Poland, weighed anywhere from 196.26&amp;nbsp;g to 201.86&amp;nbsp;g, depending on the timeframe. In the 14th century, it was equal to 196.26&amp;nbsp;g, while in the beginning of the 16th century in weighed 197.684&amp;nbsp;g, but after 1558 it was equivalent to 201.802&amp;nbsp;g and after 1650 it was 201.86&amp;nbsp;g.

The Kraków grzywna was subdivided thus: 4 [[wiardunek]]s or quarters = 8 [[ounces]] = 16 [[dram (unit)|dram]]s = 24 [[skojec]]s = 96 [[grain (unit)|grain]]s = 240 [[denarii]] = 480 [[Obolus|obols]]

As a measure of unit of exchange, the Kraków grzywna was equal to 48 [[Prague groschen]]. During the rule of [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]] 576 denarii were struck from one Kraków grzywna of [[silver]]. During the rule of his son [[Casimir the Great]], 768 denarii were struck from it and during the reign of [[Władysław II Jagiełło]], it was 864 denarii.

'''High-leg delta''' (also known as wild-leg, stinger leg, bastard leg, high-leg, orange-leg, or red-leg delta) is a type of electrical service connection for [[three-phase electric power]] installations. It is used when both single and three-phase power is desired to be supplied from a three phase transformer (or transformer bank).  The three-phase power is connected in the delta configuration, and the center point of one phase is grounded.  This creates both a split-phase single phase supply (L1 or L2 to neutral on diagram at right) and three-phase (L1-L2-L3 at right). It is called "orange leg" because the wire is color-coded orange.&lt;ref&gt;National Electrical Code (NEC), ANSI/NFPA 70, 2017 edition, Section 110.15&lt;/ref&gt;  By convention, the high leg is usually set in the center (B phase) lug in the involved panel, regardless of the L1-L2-L3 designation at the transformer.  

== Supply ==
[[File:CenterTappedTransformer.svg|thumb|250px|Center-tapped delta transformer]]
[[File:CenterTappedTransformer Voltages.svg|thumb|Center-tapped delta transformer voltages]]
High-leg delta service is supplied in one of two ways. One is by a transformer having four wires coming out of the secondary, the three phases, plus a neutral connected as a center-tap on one of the windings. Another method requires two transformers. One transformer is connected to one phase of the overhead primary distribution circuit to provide the 'lighting' side of the circuit (this will be the larger of the two transformers), and a second transformer is connected to another phase on the circuit and its secondary is connected to one side of the 'lighting' transformer secondary, and the other side of this transformer is brought out as the 'high leg'. The voltages between the three phases are the same in magnitude, however the voltage magnitudes between a particular phase and the neutral vary. The phase-to-neutral voltage of two of the phases will be half of the phase-to-phase voltage. The remaining phase-to-neutral voltage will be {{radic|3}}/2 the phase-to-phase voltage. So if A-B, B-C and C-A are all 240 volts, then A-N and C-N will both be 120 volts, but B-N will be 208 volts.

Other types of three-phase supplies are wye connections, ungrounded delta connections, "ghost" leg configuration delta connections (two transformers supplying three phase power), or corner-grounded delta&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.schneider-electric.us/docs/Circuit%20Protection/Molded%20Case%20Circuit%20Breakers/2700DB0202.pdf |title=Corner-Grounded Delta (Grounded B Phase) Systems |publisher=Schneider Electric |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; connections.  These connections do not supply split single-phase power, and do not have a high leg.

== Explanation ==
[[File:High leg delta.svg|thumb|[[Phasor]] diagram showing 240 V delta and center-tapped phase (a-c) creating 120 V voltages.]]

Consider the low-voltage side of a 120/240&amp;nbsp;V high leg delta connected transformer, where the 'b' phase is the 'high' leg. The line-to-line voltage magnitudes are all the same:

:&lt;math&gt;
  V_{ab} = V_{bc} = V_{ca} =
    240\, \text {V}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Because the winding between the 'a' and 'c' phases is center-tapped, the line-to-neutral voltages for these phases are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
  V_{an} = V_{cn} = \frac{V_{ac}}{2} =
    120\, \text{V}.
&lt;/math&gt;

But the phase-neutral voltage for the 'b' phase is different:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{bn} = \sqrt{{V_{ab}}^2 - {V_{an}}^2} \approx 208\, \text{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be proven by writing a [[KVL]] equation, using [[angle notation]], starting from the grounded neutral:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;0 + 120 \angle 0^\circ + 240 \angle 120^\circ \\
  = {} &amp;0 + 120 \angle 0^\circ + 240(-0.5)\angle 0^\circ + 240\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \angle 90^\circ \\
  = {} &amp;0 + 120 \angle 0^\circ - 120 \angle 0^\circ + 240\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \angle 90^\circ \\
  = {} &amp;240\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \angle 90^\circ = 120\sqrt{3} \angle 90^\circ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt;0 + 120 \sin(0^\circ) + 240 \sin(120^\circ) = 0 + 0 + 240 \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 207.8.&lt;/math&gt;

== Advantages ==
If the "high leg" is not used, the system acts like a split single-phase system, which is familiar.

Both three-phase and single split-phase power can be supplied from a single transformer bank.

Where the three-phase load is small relative to the total load, two individual transformers may be used instead of the three for a "full delta" or a three-phase transformer, thus providing a variety of voltages at reduced cost. This is called "open-delta high-leg", and has a reduced capacity relative to a full delta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalpacific.com/university/transbasics/chapter3.html |title=Transformer Basics Chapter 3 |publisher=Federalpacific.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530122049/http://www.federalpacific.com/university/transbasics/chapter3.html |archivedate=2012-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBSTWOl4V8IC&amp;pg=PA58 |title=Electrician's Calculations Manual |author=Nick Fowler|date= 2005-01-01|accessdate=2012-07-30|isbn=978-0-07-143654-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cT8D9_WP7MC&amp;pg=PA252 |title=Illustrated Guide to the 1999 National Electrical Code  |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30|isbn=978-1-57218-075-8 |author1=Traister |first1=John E |last2=Maher |first2=Bradford |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
In cases where the single-phase load is much greater than the three-phase load, load balancing will be poor.  Generally, these cases are identified by three transformers supplying the service, two of which are sized significantly smaller than the third, and the third larger transformer will be center tap grounded.

One of the phase-to-neutral voltage (usually phase "B") is higher than the other two.   The hazard of this is that if single phase loads are connected to the high leg (with the connecting person unaware that that leg is higher voltage), excess voltage is supplied to that load.  This can easily cause failure of the load.

Commonly there is a high-leg to neutral load limit when only two transformers are used.&lt;ref name=Fowler&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Nick|title=Electrician's Calculations Manual 2nd Edition|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-177017-0|pages=3–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9QBWHJdPGM0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; One transformer manufacturer's page suggests that High-leg to neutral loading to not exceed 5% of transformer capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalpacific.com/university/transbasics/chapter3.html Federal pacific] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530122049/http://www.federalpacific.com/university/transbasics/chapter3.html |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
It is often found in older and rural installations. This type of service is usually supplied using 240&amp;nbsp;V line-to-line and 120&amp;nbsp;V line-to-neutral. In some ways, the high leg delta service provides the best of both worlds: a line-to-line voltage that is higher than the usual 208&amp;nbsp;V that most three-phase services have, and a line-to-neutral voltage (on two of the phases) sufficient for connecting appliances and lighting. Thus, large pieces of equipment will draw less current than with 208&amp;nbsp;V, requiring smaller wire and breaker sizes. Lights and appliances requiring 120&amp;nbsp;V can be connected to phases 'A' and 'C' without requiring an additional step-down transformer.

Even when unmarked, it is generally easy to identify this type of system, because the "B" phase (circuits #3 and #4) and every third circuit afterwards will be either a three-pole breaker or a blank.  

Current practice is to give separate services for single-phase and three-phase loads, e.g., 120&amp;nbsp;V [[split-phase electric power|split-phase]] (lighting etc.) and 240&amp;nbsp;V to 600&amp;nbsp;V [[three-phase electric power|three-phase]] (for large motors). However, many jurisdictions forbid more than one class for a premises' service, and the choice may come down to 120/240 split-phase, 208 single-phase or three-phase (delta), 120/208 three-phase (wye), or 277/480 three-phase (wye) (or 347/600 three-phase (wye) in Canada).

'''Interface and colloid science''' is an interdisciplinary intersection of branches of [[chemistry]], [[physics]], nanoscience and other fields dealing with [[colloid]]s, [[heterogeneous]] systems consisting of a mechanical mixture of particles between 1&amp;nbsp;nm and 1000&amp;nbsp;nm dispersed in a continuous medium. A colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture in which the particle size of the substance is intermediate between a [[solution|true solution]] and a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], i.e. between 1–1000 nm. Smoke from a fire is an example of a colloidal system in which tiny particles of solid float in air. Just like true solutions, colloidal particles are small and cannot be seen by the naked eye. They easily pass through filter paper. But colloidal particles are big enough to be blocked by parchment paper or animal membrane.

Interface and colloid science has applications and ramifications in the chemical industry, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, ceramics, minerals, [[nanotechnology]], and microfluidics, among others.

'''Lanthanum hexaboride''' ('''[[Lanthanum|La]][[Boron|B]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;''', also called '''lanthanum boride''' and '''LaB''') is an inorganic chemical, a [[boride]] of [[lanthanum]]. It is a [[refractory]] [[ceramic]] material that has a melting point of 2210&amp;nbsp;°C, and is insoluble in water and [[hydrochloric acid]]. It has a low [[work function]] and one of the highest [[electron]] emissivities known, and is stable in [[vacuum]]. [[Stoichiometric]] samples are colored intense purple-violet, while boron-rich ones (above LaB&lt;sub&gt;6.07&lt;/sub&gt;) are blue. Ion bombardment changes its color from purple to emerald green.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = T. Lundström | title = Structure, defects and properties of some refractory borides | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | year = 1985 | volume = 57 | issue = 10 | pages = 1383–1390 | doi = 10.1351/pac198557101383 | url = http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1985/pdf/5710x1383.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal use of lanthanum hexaboride is in [[hot cathode]]s, either as a single crystal or as a coating deposited by [[physical vapor deposition]]. Hexaborides, such as lanthanum hexaboride (LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[cerium hexaboride]] (CeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), have low [[work function]]s, around 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]]. They are also somewhat resistant to cathode poisoning. Cerium hexaboride cathodes have a lower evaporation rate at 1700&amp;nbsp;K than lanthanum hexaboride, but they become equal at temperatures above 1850&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Comparing Lanthanum Hexaboride (LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and Cerium Hexaboride (CeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) Cathodes | url = http://www.emsdiasum.com/microscopy/technical/datasheet/80920.aspx| accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerium hexaboride cathodes have one and half the lifetime of lanthanum hexaboride, due to the former's higher resistance to carbon contamination. Hexaboride cathodes are about ten times "brighter" than [[tungsten]] cathodes, and have 10–15 times longer lifetime. Devices and techniques in which hexaboride cathodes are used include [[electron microscope]]s, [[microwave tube]]s, [[electron lithography]], [[electron beam welding]], [[X-ray tube]]s, and [[free electron laser]]s. Lanthanum hexaboride slowly evaporates from the heated cathodes and forms deposits on the [[Wehnelt cylinder]]s and apertures. LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is also used as a size/strain standard in [[X-ray powder diffraction]] to calibrate instrumental broadening of diffraction peaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C. T.

[sequences published on [[GenBank]]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Upper pitcher of ''N.&amp;nbsp;mirabilis'' from [[Kelantan]] pictured.)]]
This '''list of ''Nepenthes'' endophytes''' is a listing of [[endophyte]]s recorded from the internal tissues of ''[[Nepenthes]]'' [[pitcher plant]]s; that is, organisms that live within the plants for at least part of their life cycles without causing apparent disease.

The endophyte species are listed alphabetically and grouped by [[genus]], [[family (biology)|family]], and [[phylum]]. Additional information is included in brackets after the [[Strain (biology)|strain]] designation, namely: the host ''Nepenthes'' species from which the endophyte has been recorded; the geographical source of the record; and the type of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] sampled.

This article provides a '''list of the largest [[hydroelectric]] power stations''' by generating capacity. Only plants with capacity larger than 2,000 MW are listed.

The [[Three Gorges Dam]] in [[Hubei]], China, has the world's largest instantaneous generating capacity (22,500 MW), with the [[Itaipu Dam]] in [[Brazil]]/[[Paraguay]] in second place (14,000 MW). Despite the large difference in installed capacity these two power stations generate nearly equal amounts of electrical energy during the course of an entire year - Itaipu 103.1 TWh in 2016&lt;ref name=ita2016&gt;{{cite news |title=Brasil retiró casi 92 millones MWh de la producción récord de Itaipú|url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/economia/brasil-retiro-casi-92-millones-mwh-de-la-produccion-record-de-itaipu-1552332.html|website=Abc.com|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Three Gorges 98.8 TWh in 2014,&lt;ref name=3g&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2894386/Chinas-Three-Gorges-dam-breaks-world-hydropower-record.html |title=China's Three Gorges dam 'breaks world hydropower record' |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2015-01-02 |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the Three Gorges experiences six months per year when there is very little water available to generate power, while the [[Paraná River]] that feeds the Itaipu has a much lower seasonal variance in flow. Power output of the Three Gorges reaches 125 TWh in years of high feed availability.

The Three Gorges (22,500 MW - 32 × 700 MW and 2 × 50 MW) is operated jointly with the much smaller [[Gezhouba Dam]] (2,715 MW), the total generating capacity of this two-dam complex is 25,215 MW. The Itaipu on the [[Brazil–Paraguay border]] has 20 generator units with overall 14,000 MW of installed capacity, however the maximum number of generating units allowed to operate simultaneously cannot exceed 18 (12,600 MW).

The [[Jinsha River]] (the upper stream of [[Yangtze River]]) complex is the largest hydroelectric generating system currently under construction. It has three phases. Phase one includes four dams on the downstream of the Jinsha River. They are [[Wudongde Dam]], [[Baihetan Dam]], [[Xiluodu Dam]], and [[Xiangjiaba Dam]], with generating capacity of 10,200 MW, 16,000 MW, 13,860 MW, and 6,448 MW respectively. Phase two includes eight dams on the middle stream of the Jinsha River. The total generating capacity is 21,150 MW. Phase three includes eight dams on the upper stream of the Jinsha River. The total generating capacity is 8,980 MW. The total combined capacity of the Jinsha complex with the Three Gorges complex will be 101,853 MW.

Preliminary plans exist for the construction of the next largest hydroelectric power station with an installed capacity of 39,000 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Development of the Grand Inga|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/africa/grand-inga-grand-illusions|accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Project is called [[Grand Inga]] and is planned to be realised on the lower [[Congo River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Africa plans biggest dam project, the Grand Inga|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7358542.stm|work=BBC News|date=2008-04-21|accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is said to have been working on a 50,000 MW&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/6781-World-s-largest-hydropower-project-planned-for-Tibetan-Plateau|title=World's largest hydropower project planned for Tibetan Plateau|website=www.chinadialogue.net|language=en|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; dam as part of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon#Yarlung Tsangpo Hydroelectric and Water Diversion Project|Yarlung Tsangpo Hydroelectric and Water Diversion Project]]

Another proposal, [[Penzhin Tidal Power Plant Project|Penzhin Tidal Power Plant]], presumes an installed capacity up to {{nowrap|87,100 MW}}.

The largest hydroelectric power stations top the [[List of largest power stations in the world|list of the largest power stations of any kind]], are among the largest [[hydraulic structure]]s and are some of the [[:Category:Lists of largest buildings and structures|largest artificial structures]] in the world.

== List ==

=== Completed ===
Only operational power stations with an installed capacity of at least 2,000 MW. Some of these may have additional units under construction, but only current installed capacity is listed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20492">In its most general form, the '''magnetoelectric effect''' (ME) denotes any coupling between the magnetic and the electric properties of a material.&lt;ref name="Fiebig2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZurichLab"/&gt; The first example of such an effect was described by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] in 1888, who found that a dielectric material moving through an electric field would become magnetized.&lt;ref name="Roentgen1888"/&gt; A material where such a coupling is intrinsically present is called a '''magnetoelectric'''.

Historically, the first and most studied example of this effect is the '''linear magnetoelectric effect'''. Mathematically, while the [[electric susceptibility]] &lt;math&gt;\chi^e&lt;/math&gt; and [[magnetic susceptibility]] &lt;math&gt;\chi^v&lt;/math&gt; describe the electric and magnetic polarization responses to an electric, resp. a magnetic field, there is also the possibility of a magnetoelectric susceptibility &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; which describes a linear response of the electric polarization to a magnetic field, and vice versa:&lt;ref name="LandauLifschitz"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_i= \sum_j \epsilon_0\chi^e_{ij} E_{j} + \sum_j \alpha_{ij}H_j&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_0 M_i= \sum_j \mu_0\chi^v_{ij}H_{j} + \sum_j \alpha_{ij}E_j,&lt;/math&gt;
The tensor &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; must be the same in both equations. Here, P is the electric polarization, M the magnetization, E and H the electric and magnetic fields. The SI Unit of α is [s/m] which can be converted to the practical unit [V/(cm Oe)] by [s/m]=1.1 x10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; [V/(cm Oe)]. For the CGS unit, [unitless] = 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [s/m]/(4 x π)

The first material where an intrinsic linear magnetoelectric effect was predicted theoretically and confirmed experimentally is Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Dzyaloshinskii1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Astrov1960"/&gt; This is a single-phase material. [[Multiferroics]] are another example of single-phase materials that can exhibit a general magnetoelectric effect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spaldin|first=Nicola A.|last2=Fiebig|first2=Manfred|date=2005-07-15|title=The Renaissance of Magnetoelectric Multiferroics|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/309/5733/391|journal=Science|language=en|volume=309|issue=5733|pages=391–392|doi=10.1126/science.1113357|issn=0036-8075|pmid=16020720}}&lt;/ref&gt; if their magnetic and electric orders are coupled. Composite materials are another way to realize magnetoelectrics. There, the idea is to combine, say a magnetostrictive and a [[piezoelectric]] material. These two materials interact by strain, leading to a coupling between magnetic and electric properties of the compound material.

Some promising applications of the ME effect are sensitive detection of magnetic fields, advanced logic devices and tunable microwave filters.&lt;ref name="Nan2008"/&gt;

== History ==
The first example of a magnetoelectric effect was discussed in 1888 by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]], who showed that a dielectric material moving through an electric field would become magnetized.&lt;ref name="Roentgen1888"/&gt; The possibility of an intrinsic magnetoelectric effect in a (non-moving) material was conjectured by P. Curie&lt;ref&gt;P. Curie J. Physique, 3ième série III (1894)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1894, while the term "magnetoelectric" was coined by P. Debye&lt;ref&gt;P. Debye, Z. Phys. 36, 300 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1926.
A mathematical formulation of the linear magnetoelectric effect was included in L. D. Landau and E. Lifshitz famous book series on theoretical physics.&lt;ref name="LandauLifschitz"/&gt; Only in 1959, I. Dzyaloshinskii,&lt;ref name="Dzyaloshinskii1960"/&gt; using an elegant symmetry argument, derived the form of a linear magnetoelectric coupling in Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
The experimental confirmation came just few months later when the effect was observed for the first time by D. Astrov.&lt;ref name="Astrov1960"/&gt; The general excitement which followed the measurement of the linear magnetoelectric effect lead to the organization of the series of MEIPIC (Magnetoelectric Interaction Phenomena in Crystals) conferences. Between the prediction of I. Dzialoshinskii and the MEIPIC first edition (1973), more than 80 linear magnetoelectric compounds were found. Recently, technological and theoretical progress, driven in large part by the advent of multiferroic materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spaldin|first=Nicola A.|last2=Cheong|first2=Sang-Wook|last3=Ramesh|first3=Ramamoorthy|date=2010|title=Multiferroics: Past, present, and future|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=10|pages=38|doi=10.1063/1.3502547|bibcode=2010PhT....63j..38S}}&lt;/ref&gt; triggered a renaissance of these studies and magnetoelectric effect is still heavily investigated.&lt;ref name="Fiebig2005"/&gt;

== Phenomenology ==

If the coupling between magnetic and electric properties is analytic, then the magnetoelectric effect can be described by an expansion of the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] as a power series in the electric and magnetic fields &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="Fiebig2005"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F(E,H) &amp;= F_0 - P^{s}_i E_i - M^{s}_i H_i
    - \frac12 \epsilon_0 \chi^e_{ij} E_i E_j - \frac12 \mu_0 \chi^v_{ij} H_i H_j
\\ &amp;\qquad
- \alpha_{ij} E_i H_j
    -\frac12 \beta_{ijk} E_i H_j H_k -\frac12 \gamma_{ijk}H_i E_j E_k + \ldots
    \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiating the free energy will then give the [[electric polarization]] &lt;math&gt;P_i = -\frac{\partial F}{\partial E_i}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[magnetization]] &lt;math&gt;M_i = -\frac{\partial F}{\partial H_i}&lt;/math&gt;.
Here, &lt;math&gt;P^{s}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M^{s}&lt;/math&gt; are the static polarization, resp. magnetization of the material, whereas &lt;math&gt;\chi^e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\chi^v&lt;/math&gt; are the electric, resp. magnetic susceptibilities. The tensor &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; describes the linear magnetoelectric effect, which corresponds to a polarization induced linearly by a magnetic field, and vice versa. The higher terms with coefficients &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; describe quadratic effects. For instance, the tensor &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; describes a linear magnetoelectric effect which is, in turn, induced by an electric field.&lt;ref name="Cardwell1969"/&gt;

The possible terms appearing in the expansion above are constrained by symmetries of the material. Most notably, the tensor &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; must be antisymmetric under [[time-reversal symmetry]].&lt;ref name="LandauLifschitz"/&gt; Therefore, the linear magnetoelectric effect may only occur if time-reversal symmetry is explicitly broken, for instance by the explicit motion in Röntgens' example, or by an intrinsic magnetic ordering in the material. In contrast, the tensor &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; may be non-vanishing in time-reversal symmetric materials.

==Microscopic Origin==

There are several ways in which a magnetoelectric effect can arise microscopically in a material.

===Single-ion anisotropy===
In crystals, [[spin-orbit coupling]] is responsible for single-ion [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]]  which determines preferential axes for the orientation of the spins (such as easy axes). An external electric field may change the local symmetry seen by magnetic ions and affect both the strength of the anisotropy and the direction of the easy axes. Thus, single-ion anisotropy can couple an external electric field to spins of magnetically ordered compounds.

===Symmetric Exchange striction===
The main interaction between spins of transition metal ions in solids is usually provided by [[superexchange]]. This interaction depends on details of the crystal structure such as the bond length between magnetic ions and the angle formed by the bonds between magnetic and ligand ions. Symmetric exchange can be both positive and negative and is the main responsible of magnetic ordering.
As the strength of symmetric exchange depends on the relative position of the ions, it couples spins to collective lattice distortions, called [[phonons]].
Coupling of spins to collective distortion with a net electric dipole can happen if the magnetic order breaks inversion symmetry. Thus, symmetric exchange can provide a handle to control magnetic properties through an external electric field.

===Strain driven magnetoelectric heterostructured effect===
Because materials exist that couple strain to electrical polarization (piezoelectrics, electrostrictives, and ferroelectrics) and that couple strain to magnetization (magnetostrictive/[[magnetoelastic effect|magnetoelastic]]/ferromagnetic materials), it is possible to couple magnetic and electric properties indirectly by creating composites of these materials that are tightly bonded so that strains transfer from one to the other.

Thin film strategy enables achievement of interfacial multiferroic coupling through a mechanical channel in heterostructures consisting of a [[magnetoelastic effect|magnetoelastic]] and a piezoelectric component.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan2002"/&gt; This type of heterostructure is composed of an epitaxial magnetoelastic thin film grown on a piezoelectric substrate. For this system, application of a magnetic field will induce a change in the dimension of the [[magnetoelastic effect|magnetoelastic]] film. This process, called magnetostriction, will alter residual strain conditions in the magnetoelastic film, which can be transferred through the interface to the piezoelectric substrate. Consequently, a polarization is introduced in the substrate through the piezoelectric process. The overall effect is that the polarization of the ferroelectric substrate is manipulated by an application of a magnetic field, which is the desired magnetoelectric effect (the reverse is also possible). In this case, the interface plays an important role in mediating the responses from one component to another, realizing the magnetoelectric coupling.&lt;ref name="Scott2007"/&gt; For an efficient coupling, a high-quality interface with optimal strain state is desired. In light of this interest, advanced deposition techniques have been applied to synthesize these types of thin film heterostructures. Molecular beam epitaxy has been demonstrated to be capable of depositing structures consisting of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive components. Materials systems studied included cobalt ferrite, magnetite, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, PMNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xie | first1 = S. | last2 = Cheng | first2 = J. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title =  Interfacial structure and chemistry of epitaxial CoFe[sub 2]O[sub 4] thin films on SrTiO[sub 3] and MgO substrates| doi = 10.1063/1.3006060 | journal = Appl.

===Flexomagnetoelectric effect===

Magnetically driven ferroelectricity is also caused by inhomogeneous&lt;ref name="Baryakhtar1983"/&gt; magnetoelectric interaction. This effect appears due to the coupling between inhomogeneous order parameters. It was also called as flexomagnetoelectric effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyatakov | first1 = A.P. | last2 = Zvezdin | first2 = A.K. | year = 2009 | title = Flexomagnetoelectric interaction in multiferroics| url = | journal = Eur.

The '''maximum landing weight (MLW)''' is the maximum [[Aircraft Gross Weight|aircraft gross weight]] due to design or operational limitations at which an aircraft is permitted to land.

The operation landing weight may be limited to a weight lower than the maximum landing weight by the most restrictive of the following requirements:

* Aircraft performance requirements for a given altitude and temperature:
:*landing field length requirements,
:*approach and landing climb requirements
* Noise requirements

If the flight has been of short duration (for example an emergency just after takeoff), it may be necessary to [[Fuel dumping|dump fuel]] to reduce the landing weight.

Where aircraft overweight landing is permitted, a structural inspection or evaluation of the touch-down loads before the next aircraft operation will be required in case damage has occurred.

The '''Novovoronezh nuclear power station''' ({{lang-ru|Нововоронежская АЭС}} [{{Audio|Ru-Нововоронежская атомная электростанция.ogg|pronunciation}}]) is a [[nuclear power]] station close to [[Novovoronezh]] in [[Voronezh Oblast]], central Russia.  The site was vital to the development of the [[VVER]] design; every unit built was essentially a prototype of its design. On this site is built the [[Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant II]].

In 2002 Novovoronezh-3 was modernised and life extended, including new safety systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2015522 |title=New life of Novovoronezh 3 |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=9 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714162729/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2015522 |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Novovoronezh-5 was shut down for modernization to extend its operating life for an additional 25 years, the first [[VVER-1000]] to undergo such an operating life extension. The works include the modernization of management, protection and emergency systems, and improvement of security and radiation safety systems.&lt;ref name=nei-20100930&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2057673 |title=Modernization works begin at Russia’s oldest VVER-1000 |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=30 September 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613091943/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2057673 |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nuclear Regulatory Commission''' ('''NRC''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the United States government]] tasked with protecting public health and safety related to nuclear energy. Established by the [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974]], the NRC began operations on January 19, 1975 as one of two successor agencies to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]. Its functions  include overseeing [[Nuclear reactor safety system|reactor safety]] and security, administering reactor licensing and renewal, licensing [[radioactive materials]], [[radionuclide]] safety, and managing the storage, security, recycling, and disposal of [[spent fuel]].

==History==
Prior to 1975 the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] was in charge of matters regarding radionuclides. The AEC was dissolved, because it was perceived as unduly favoring the industry it was charged with regulating.&lt;ref name=atom19&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC was formed as an independent commission to oversee [[Nuclear power in the United States|nuclear energy]] matters, oversight of [[nuclear medicine]], and [[nuclear safety and security]].

The U.S. AEC became the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] (ERDA) in 1975, responsible for development and oversight of [[nuclear weapon]]s. Research and promotion of civil uses of radioactive materials, such as for nuclear [[non-destructive testing]], nuclear medicine, and [[nuclear power]], was split into the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science &amp; Technology within ERDA by the same act. In 1977, ERDA became the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). In 2000, the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] was created as a subcomponent of DOE, responsible for nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=wellc/&gt;

Twelve years into NRC operations, a 1987 Congressional report entitled "NRC Coziness with Industry"&lt;ref name=congress&gt;{{cite web|title=NRC' COZINESS- WITH" INDUSTRY" Nuclear Regulatory Commission Fails to Maintain Arms Length Relationship with the Nuclear Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/NRC_coziness_with_industry.html?id=yaDs5KO2hncC|work=An Investigative Report 100th" Congress First Session|accessdate=21 May 2014|author=U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Subcommittee on General, Oversight and Investigations|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded, that the NRC "has not maintained an arms length regulatory posture with the commercial nuclear power industry... [and] has, in some critical areas, abdicated its role as a regulator altogether".&lt;ref name=atom19/&gt; To cite three examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

A 1986 Congressional report found that NRC staff had provided valuable technical assistance to the utility seeking an operating license for the controversial [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant|Seabrook plant]]. In the late 1980s, the NRC 'created a policy' of non-enforcement by asserting its discretion not to enforce license conditions; between September 1989 and 1994, the 'NRC has either waived or chosen not to enforce regulations at nuclear power reactors over 340 times'. Finally, critics charge that the NRC has ceded important aspects of regulatory authority to the industry's own Institute for Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), an organization formed by utilities in response to the Three Mile Island Accident.&lt;ref name=atom19/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The origins and development of NRC regulatory processes and policies are explained in five volumes of history published by the [[University of California Press]]. These are:&lt;ref name=wellc/&gt;
* ''Controlling the Atom: The Beginnings of Nuclear Regulation 1946–1962'' (1984).
* ''Containing the Atom: Nuclear Regulation in a Changing Environment, 1963–1971'' (1992).
* ''Permissible Dose: A History of Radiation Protection in the Twentieth Century'' (2000)
* ''[[Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective]]'' (2004)
* ''The Road to Yucca Mountain:  The Development of Radioactive Waste Policy in the United States'' (2009).

The NRC has produced a booklet, ''A Short History of Nuclear Regulation 1946–2009'', which outlines key issues in NRC history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/brochures/br0175/|title=NRC: A Short History of Nuclear Regulation, 1946–2009 (NUREG/BR-0175, Revision 2)|website=www.nrc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Wellock]], a former academic, is the NRC historian. Before joining the NRC, Wellock wrote ''[[Critical Masses: Opposition to Nuclear Power in California, 1958–1978]]''.&lt;ref name=wellc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/history.html#nrctoday |title=NRC history |author=NRC |year=2013 |work= NRC website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and commissioners==
The NRC's mission is to regulate the nation's civilian use of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials to ensure adequate protection of public health and safety, to promote the common defense and security, and to protect the environment.
The NRC's regulatory mission covers three main areas{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}:
* ''Reactors'' – Commercial reactors for generating electric power and research and test reactors used for research, testing, and training
* ''Materials'' – Uses of nuclear materials in medical, industrial, and academic settings and facilities that produce nuclear fuel
* ''Waste'' – Transportation, storage, and disposal of nuclear materials and waste, and decommissioning of nuclear facilities from service.

The NRC is headed by five Commissioners appointed by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] for five-year terms. One of them is designated by the President to be the Chairman and official spokesperson of the Commission.

The current chairman is [[Kristine Svinicki]]. President [[Donald Trump]] designated Svinicki as Chairman of the NRC effective January 23, 2017.&lt;ref name="svnicki"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/organization/commission/svinicki.html|title=Chairman Kristine L.

==Organization==
The NRC consists of the Commission on the one hand and offices of the Executive Director for Operations on the other.&lt;ref name=org&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization &amp; Functions|url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/organization.html|work=website|publisher=NRC|accessdate=21 May 2014|date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Commission is divided into two committees (Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards and Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes) and one Board, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, as well as eight commission staff offices (Office of Commission Appellate Adjudication, Office of Congressional Affairs, Office of the General Counsel, Office of International Programs, Office of Public Affairs, Office of the Secretary, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Executive Director for Operations).

Kristine Svinicki is the chairman of the NRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/organization/commfuncdesc.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are altogether 17 Executive Director for Operations offices: Office of Federal and State Materials and Environmental Management Programs,
Office of New Reactors, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, [[Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation]], Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, Office of Enforcement, which investigates reports by [[nuclear power whistleblowers]], specifically the Allegations Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/allegations-resp.html |title= Allegations |date=28 June 2013|publisher=NRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Office of Investigations, Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response, Region I, Region II, Region III, Region IV, Office of Information Services, Computer Security Office, Office of Administration, Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer, and Office of Small Business and Civil Rights.&lt;ref name=org /&gt;

Of these operations offices, NRC's major program components are the first five offices mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Register NRC |url=https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/nuclear-regulatory-commission|work=Federal Register|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NRC's proposed FY 2015 budget is $1,059.5&amp;nbsp;million, with 3,895.9 full-time equivalents (FTE), 90 percent of which is recovered by fees. This is an increase of $3.6&amp;nbsp;million, including 65.1 FTE, compared to FY 2014.&lt;ref name=budget&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Budget Justification: Fiscal Year 2015 (NUREG-1100, Volume 30)|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1100/v30/|work=NUREG-1100, Volume 30|publisher=NRC|accessdate=21 May 2014|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NRC headquarters offices are located in unincorporated [[North Bethesda, Maryland]] (although the mailing address for two of the three main buildings in the complex list the city as [[Rockville, MD]]), and there are four regional offices.

===Regions===
{{main|Regions of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission}}
[[File:Figure 2- Map of Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Regions and 37 Agreement States (14450812744) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of the NRC regions]]

The NRC territory is broken down into four geographical regions; until the late 1990s, there was a Region V office in [[Walnut Creek, California]] which was absorbed into Region IV, and Region V was dissolved.

* [[:Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region I|Region I]], located in [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania]], oversees the [[northeastern United States|northeastern states]].
* [[:Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region II|Region II]], located in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], oversees most of the [[southeastern United States|southeastern states]].
* [[:Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region III|Region III]], located in [[Lisle, Illinois]], oversees the [[midwestern United States|Midwest]].
* [[:Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region IV|Region IV]], located in [[Arlington, Texas]], oversees the  [[western United States|western]] and [[South Central United States|south central states]].

In these four regions NRC oversees the operation of [[List of nuclear reactors#United States|US nuclear reactors]], namely 104 power-producing reactors, and 36 non-power-producing reactors. Oversight is done on several levels. For example:

* Each power-producing reactor site has resident inspectors, who monitor day-to-day operations.
* Numerous special inspection teams, with many different specialties, routinely conduct inspections at each site.

==Recordkeeping system==
NRC has a library, which also contains online document collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRC Document Collections|url=https://forms.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/|work=website|publisher=NRC|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 it started an electronic repository called ADAMS, the Agencywide Documents Access and Management System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ About the Agencywide Documents Access and Management System|url=https://forms.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams/faq.html#1|work=website|publisher=NRC|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its public inspection reports, correspondence, and other technical documents written by NRC staff, contractors, and licensees. It has been upgraded in October 2010 and is now webbased. Of documents from 1980 to 1999 only some have abstracts and/or full text, most are citations. Documents from before 1980 are available in paper or microfiche formats. Copies of these older documents or classified documents can be applied for with a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request.

==Training and accreditation==
[[Image:Agency headquarters Graphic.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Commission headquarters]]
NRC conducts audits and training inspections, observes the National Nuclear Accrediting Board meetings, and nominates some members.

The industry through INPO created the 'National Academy for Nuclear Training Program' either as early as 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Academy for Nuclear Training Program|url=http://www.nei.org/Careers-Education/Education-Resources/Resources-for-Teachers-and-Students/Scholarships-Internships-and-Fellowships/Industry-Scholarships-and-Fellowships-in-Nuclear-E/National-Academy-for-Nuclear-Training-Program|work=websute|publisher=Nuclear Energy Institute nei.org|accessdate=21 May 2014|author=NEI|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in September 1985 per the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref name=IAEA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pate|first=Zack T.|title=INPO's impact in the USA|journal=International Atomic Energy Agency Bulletin|date=Autumn 1986|pages=60–62|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; INPO refers to NANT as "our National Academy for Nuclear Training" on its website.&lt;ref name=inpo&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|work=website|publisher=Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO)|author=Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO)|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NANT integrates and standardizes the training programs of INPO and US nuclear energy companies, offers training scholarships and interacts with the 'National Nuclear Accrediting Board'. This Board is closely related to the 'National Academy for Nuclear Training', not a government body, and referred to as independent by INPO,&lt;ref name=inpo /&gt; the Nuclear Energy Institute, and nuclear utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PG&amp;E Senior Vice President Appointed to National Nuclear Accrediting Board|url=http://www.pge.com/myhome/edusafety/systemworks/dcpp/newsmedia/pressrelease/archive/pge_senior_vice_president_appointed_to_national_nuclear_accrediting_board.shtml|work=website|publisher=Pacific Gas and Electric Corporation|accessdate=21 May 2014|date=11 February 2013|quote=The independent National Nuclear Accrediting Board evaluates operator and technical training programs for nuclear plants throughout the industry, ensuring that accredited training programs meet the highest standards for excellence and incorporate best practices.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not by the NRC, all of whom are represented on the Board

The 1982 [[Nuclear Waste Policy Act]] directed NRC in Section 306 to issue regulations or "other appropriate regulatory guidance" on training of nuclear plant personnel. Since the nuclear industry already had developed training and accreditation, NRC issued a policy statement in 1985, endorsing the INPO program. NRC has a memorandum of agreement with INPO and "monitors INPO activities by observing accreditation team visits and the monthly NNAB meetings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The United States of America National Report for the Convention on Nuclear Safety|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1650/initial/|work=NUREG-1650|publisher=NRC|accessdate=21 May 2014|author=NRC|pages=11–15|date=September 2001|quote=In accordance with its memorandum of agreement with the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), the NRC monitors INPO accreditation activities as part of its assessment of the effectiveness of the industry's training programs. (The NRC also monitors the selected performance areas of its licensees as part of its assessment.) The NRC monitors INPO activities by observing accreditation team visits and the monthly National Nuclear Accrediting Board meetings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, NRC endorsed the industry's approach to training that had been used for nearly a decade through its 'Training Rule'.&lt;ref name=nrc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operator-licensing/related-documents.html|author= NRc|work=website|title= Related Documents and Other Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1994, NRC passed the 'Operator Requalification Rule' 59 FR 5938, Feb. 9, 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewal of Licenses and Requalification Requirements for Licensed  Operators|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1994-02-09/html/94-2927.htm|work=Federal Register Volume 59, Number 27|publisher=Government Printing Office|accessdate=21 May 2014|author=NRC|date=February 9, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing each nuclear power plant company -rather than the agency- to conduct the operator licensing renewal examination every six years, eliminating the requirement of NRC-administered written requalification examination.

In 1999, NRC issued a final rule on operator initial licensing examination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Initial Licensed Operator Examination Requirements|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operator-licensing/op-licensing-files/v64n78p19868.txt|publisher=Government Printing Office|accessdate=21 May 2014|author=NRC|date=23 April 1999|work=Federal Register Volume 64, Number 78}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows, but does not require, companies to "prepare, proctor, and grade" their own operator initial licensing examinations. Facilities can "upon written request" continue to have the examinations prepared and administered by NRC staff, but if a company volunteers to prepare the examination, NRC continues to approve and administer it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subpart E—Written Examinations and Operating Tests|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part055/part055-0040.html|work=NRC Regulations (10 CFR)  PART 55—Operators licenses, § 55.40 Implementation.|publisher=NRC|accessdate=21 May 2014|author=NRC|date=23 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000 meetings between NRC and applicants or licensees have been open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff Meetings Open to the Public: Final Policy Statement|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2000-09-20/html/00-24161.htm|work=Federal Register Volume 65 Number 183|publisher=Government Printing Office|accessdate=21 May 2014|author=NRC|date=20 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrorism concerns and threats==
[[Image:NRC building.JPG|thumb|right|NRC headquarters outside [[Rockville, Maryland]]]]
Terrorist attacks such as those executed by [[al-Qaeda]] on [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] on [[September 11 attacks|September&amp;nbsp;11, 2001]] and in [[London]] on [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July&amp;nbsp;7, 2005]] have prompted fears that extremist groups might use radioactive [[dirty bomb]]s in further attacks in the United States and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=wash&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402291_pf.html|title= After A Nuclear 9/11|publisher=Washington Post|date=25 March 2008|author=Jay Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kittrie&gt;[http://students.law.umich.edu/mjil/article-pdfs/v28n2-kittrie.pdf Averting Catastrophe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607150719/http://students.law.umich.edu/mjil/article-pdfs/v28n2-kittrie.pdf |date=2010-06-07 }} p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE0D7143EF933A25750C0A9629C8B63|title= A Nuclear 9/11|date=10 March 2004|author=Nicholas Kristof|newspaper=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2007, undercover investigators from the [[Government Accountability Office]] set up a false company and obtained a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that would have allowed them to buy the radioactive materials needed for a dirty bomb. According to the GAO report, NRC officials did not visit the company or attempt to personally interview its executives. Instead, within 28 days, the NRC mailed the license to the West Virginia postal box. Upon receipt of the license, GAO officials were able to easily modify its stipulations, and remove a limit on the amount of radioactive material they could buy. A spokesman for the NRC said that the agency considered the radioactive devices a "lower-level threat"; a bomb built with the materials could have contaminated an area about the length of a city block, but would not have presented an immediate health hazard.&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/us/12nuke.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin|title= A Nuclear Ruse Uncovers Holes in U.S. Security|date=12 July 2012|newspaper= NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Nuclear renaissance in the United States}}
Between 2007 and 2009, 13 companies applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for construction and operating licenses to build 25 new [[nuclear power]] reactors in the [[United States]].
However, the case for widespread nuclear plant construction was eroded due to abundant natural gas supplies, slow electricity demand growth in a weak U.S. economy, lack of financing, and uncertainty following the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref name=us12/&gt; Many license applications for proposed new reactors were suspended or cancelled.&lt;ref name=eo&gt;Eileen O'Grady.

== Controversy, concerns, and criticisms before 2011==
Byrne and Hoffman wrote in 1996, that since the 1980s the NRC has generally favored the interests of nuclear industry, and been unduly responsive to industry concerns, while failing to pursue tough regulation. The NRC has often sought to hamper or deny public access to the regulatory process, and created new barriers to public participation.&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996).

[[Barack Obama]], when running for [[President of the United States of America|president]] in 2007, said that the five-member NRC had become "captive of the industries that it regulates"&lt;ref name="salon-elliot"/&gt;

Numerous different observers have criticized the NRC as an example of [[regulatory capture]]&lt;ref name="salon-elliot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/japan_earthquake/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2011/03/17/jeff_merrifield_nuclear_energy_institute|author=Justin Elliott|title=Ex-regulator flacking for pro-nuke lobby|publisher= Salon.com|date=17 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2011/0401_nuclear_meltdown_kaufmann.aspx |title=Preventing Nuclear Meltdown: Assessing Regulatory Failure in Japan and the United States |author=Daniel Kaufmann |date=April 1, 2011 |work=Brookings |page= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406062959/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2011/0401_nuclear_meltdown_kaufmann.aspx |archivedate=April 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC has been accused of having conflicting roles as regulator and "salesman" in a 2011 Reuters article,&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/18/us-nuclear-industry-nrc-idUSTRE73H0PL20110418 |title=Exclusive: U.S. nuclear regulator a policeman or salesman? |author1=Ben Berkowitz  |author2=Roberta Rampton  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=April 18, 2011 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; doing an inadequate job by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/03/28/28greenwire-japanese-nuclear-reactors-us-safety-to-take-ce-30444.html |title=Japanese Nuclear Reactors, U.S. Safety to Take Center Stage on Capitol Hill This Week|author=Hannah Northey |date=28 March 2011|work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has the agency approval process has been called a "rubber stamp".&lt;ref name="motherjones"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kate Sheppard|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/japan-nuclear-regulatory-commission|title=Is the Government's Nuclear Regulator Up to the Job?|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=17 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank N. von Hippel]] wrote in March 2011, that despite the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in Pennsylvania, the NRC has often been too timid in ensuring that America's 104 commercial reactors are operated safely:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nuclear power regulation is a textbook example of the problem of "regulatory capture" — in which an industry gains control of an agency meant to regulate it. Regulatory capture can be countered only by vigorous public scrutiny and Congressional oversight, but in the 32 years since Three Mile Island, interest in nuclear regulation has declined precipitously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/opinion/24Von-Hippel.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=frank%20von%20hippel&amp;st=cse |title=It Could Happen Here |author=Frank Von Hippel |date=23 March 2011|work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An article in the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] stated that many forms of NRC regulatory failure exist, including regulations ignored by the common consent of NRC and industry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A worker (named [[George Galatis]]) at the [[Millstone Nuclear Power Plant]] in Connecticut kept warning management, that the spent fuel rods were being put too quickly into the spent storage pool and that the number of rods in the pool exceeded specifications. Management ignored him, so he went directly to the NRC, which eventually admitted that it knew of both of the forbidden practices, which happened at many plants, but chose to ignore them. The whistleblower was fired and blacklisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/6/44.full |title=Fukushima and the inevitability of accidents |author=Charles Perrow |date=November–December 2011 |volume=vol. 67 no. 6 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages= 44–52  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Vermont, the day before the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] that [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|damaged Japan's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]], the NRC approved a 20-year extension for the license of [[Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]], although the [[Vermont state legislature]] voted overwhelmingly to deny an extension.&lt;ref name="motherjones" /&gt; The plant had been found to be leaking [[Radionuclide|radioactive materials]] through a network of underground pipes, which [[Entergy]] had denied under oath even existed. At a hearing in 2009  Tony Klein, chairman of the [[Vermont House of Representatives|Vermont House]] Natural Resources and Energy Committee had asked the NRC about the pipes and the NRC also did not know they existed.&lt;ref name="motherjones" /&gt;

In March 2011, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] released a study critical of the NRC's 2010 performance as a regulator. The UCS said that over the years, it had found the NRC's enforcement of safety rules has not been "timely, consistent, or effective" and it cited 14 "near-misses" at U.S. plants in 2010 alone.&lt;ref name="wapo-yang"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jia Lynn Yang| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/democrats-step-up-pressure-on-nuclear-regulators-over-disaster-preparedness/2011/03/17/ABLd66n_story.html|title=Democrats step up pressure on nuclear regulators over disaster preparedness|work=The Washington Post|date=March 18, 2011|accessdate= 19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Reuters reported that diplomatic cables showed NRC sometimes being used as a sales tool to help push American technology to foreign governments, when "lobbying for the purchase of equipment made by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] and other domestic manufacturers". This gives the appearance of a regulator which is acting in a commercial capacity, "raising concerns about a potential [[conflict of interest]]".&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt;

San Clemente Green, an environmental group opposed to the continued operation of the [[San Onofre Nuclear Plant]], said in 2011 that instead of being a watchdog, the NRC too often rules in favor nuclear plant operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/apr/28/anti-nuclear-protest-planned-at-nrc-meeting/ |title=Anti-nuclear protest planned at NRC meeting |author=Onell R.

=== Nuclear Reactor License Renewal Program ===
Critics have long charged that NRC has intentionally mislead the public by dismissing critical nuclear safety and environmental issues. One example involves the   license renewal program that NRC initiated to extend the operating licenses for the nation's fleet of aging commercial nuclear reactors. [[Environmental impact statement]]s (EIS) were prepared for each reactor to extend the operational period from 40 to 60 years. One study examined the EISs and found significant flaws, included failure to consider significant issues of concern.&lt;ref name="The EIS Book 2014"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The EIS Book: Managing and Preparing Environmental Impact Statements. Chapter 1. 2014. CRC Press. ISBN 1466583630.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the NRC management had significantly underestimated risk of dismissal of significant issues and failure to significantly underestimated the risk and consequences posed by a severe reactor accident such as a full-scale nuclear meltdown. NRC management asserted, without scientific evidence, that the risk of such accidents were so "Small" that the impacts could be dismissed and therefore no analysis of human and environmental was even performed. Such a conclusion is scientifically indefensible given the experience of the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]], [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] accidents. Another finding was that NRC had concealed the risk posed to the public at large by disregarding one of the most important EIS requirements, mandating that [[cumulative impacts]] be assessed (40 Code of Federal Regulations §1508.7). By disregarding this basic requirement, NRC effectively misrepresented the risk posed to the nation by approximately two orders of magnitude (i.e., the true risk is about 100 greater than NRC represented). These findings were collaborated in a final report prepared by a special Washington State Legislature Nuclear Power Task Force, titled, "Doesnt NRC Address Consequences of Severe Accidents in EISs for re-licensing?"[http://leg.wa.gov/JointCommittees/NEJSTF/Documents/14%2009%2025/Nuclear_Power.pdf] &lt;ref name="The EIS Book 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The EIS Book: Managing and Preparing Environmental Impact Statements.

==  Controversy, concerns, and criticisms since 2011 ==
[[Gregory Jaczko]] was Chairman of the NRC when the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] occurred in Japan. Jaczko looked for lessons for the US, and strengthened security regulations for [[nuclear power plant]]s. For example, he supported the requirement that new plants to be able to withstand an aircraft crash.&lt;ref name=nrc /&gt; On February 9, 2012 Jaczko cast the lone dissenting vote on plans to build the first new nuclear power plant in more than 30 years when the NRC voted 4–1 to allow Atlanta-based Southern Co to build and operate two new nuclear power reactors at its existing [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant]] in Georgia. He cited safety concerns stemming from Japan's 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], saying "I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-usa-nuclear-nrc-idUSTRE8182J720120209  |title=U.S. approves first new nuclear plant in a generation  |author=Ayesha Rascoe | date=Feb 9, 2012  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, Mark Cooper said that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is "on the defensive to prove it is doing its job of ensuring safety".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/8.abstract |title=The implications of Fukushima: The US perspective |author=Mark Cooper |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Jaczko described "a tension between wanting to move in a timely manner on regulatory questions, and not wanting to go too fast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/the-n-r-c-goes-social/ |title=The N.R.C.

In 2011 [[Edward J.

In 2011, a total of 45 groups and individuals from across the nation formally asked the NRC to suspend all licensing and other activities at 21 proposed nuclear reactor projects in 15 states until the NRC completed a thorough post-[[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] examination:&lt;ref name=groups45&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fukushima-fallout--45-groups-and-individuals-petition-nrc-to-suspend-all-nuclear-reactor-licensing-and-conduct-a-credible-three-mile-island-style-review-119844504.html|title=Fukushima Fallout: 45 Groups and Individuals Petition NRC to Suspend All Nuclear Reactor Licensing and Conduct a "Credible" Three Mile Island-Style Review |date=April 14, 2011 |work=PRNewswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2011/04/14/anti-nuclear-movement-gears  |title=Anti nuclear movement gears up |author=Carly Nairn |date=14 April 2011|work=San Francisco Bay Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; The petition seeks suspension of six existing reactor license renewal decisions ([[Columbia Generating Station]], WA [[Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station]], OH, [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]], CA, [[Indian Point Energy Center]], NY, [[Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station]], MA, and [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]], NH); 13 new reactor combined construction permit and operating license decisions ([[Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station]] Units 3 and 4, AL, Bell Bend, [[Callaway Nuclear Generating Station]], MO, [[Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Generating Station]], MD, [[Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant]], TX, [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station]], MI, [[Levy County Nuclear Power Plant]], FL [[North Anna Nuclear Generating Station]], VA, [[Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant]], NC, [[South Texas Nuclear Generating Station]], TX, [[Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station]], FL, [[Alvin W.

In addition, the petition asks the NRC to halt proceedings to approve the standardized [[AP1000]] and [[Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor]] designs.&lt;ref name=groups45/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The petitioners asked the NRC to supplement its own investigation by establishing an independent commission comparable to that set up in the wake of the less severe 1979  [[Three Mile Island accident]]. The petitioners included [[Public Citizen]], [[Southern Alliance for Clean Energy]], and San Luis Obispo [[Anti-nuclear groups in the United States#Mothers for Peace|Mothers for Peace]].&lt;ref name=groups45/&gt;

=== Intentionally concealing reports concerning the risks of flooding ===
The flooding of [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] led to the meltdown of three reactor cores and release of radiation so high that 100,000 citizens were forced to evacuate. Following the Fukushima disaster, the NRC prepared a report in 2011 to examine the risk that dam failures posed on the nation's fleet of nuclear reactors. A redacted version of NRC's report on dam failures was posted on the NRC website on March 6. The original, un-redacted version was leaked to the public.

The un-redacted version which was leaked to the public highlights the threat that flooding poses to nuclear power plants located near large dams and substantiates claims that NRC management has intentionally misled the public for years about the severity of the flooding.

The leaked version of the report concluded that one-third of the U.S. nuclear fleet (34 plants) may face flooding hazards greater than they were designed to withstand. It also shows that NRC management was aware of some aspects of this risk for 15 years and yet it had done nothing to effectively address the problem. Some flooding events are so serious that they could result in a "severe" nuclear accident, up to, and including, a nuclear meltdown.

This criticism is collaborated by two NRC whistleblowers who accused their management of deliberately covering up information concerning the vulnerability of flooding, and of failing to take corrective actions despite being aware of these risks for years. Mr. Richard Perkins, a second risk engineer with the NRC and the lead author of the leaked report, filed a complaint with the agency's Inspector General, asserting that NRC staff had improperly redacted information from the public version of his report "to prevent the disclosure of this safety information to the public because it will embarrass the agency." Perkins wrote. "Concurrently, the NRC concealed the information from the public."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zeller Tom, Huffpost, Leaked Report Suggests Long-Known Flood Threat To Nuclear Plants, Safety Advocates Say, October 19, 2012|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/19/nuclear-plant-flood-threat-leak_n_1983005.html]

Mr. Larry Criscione, a second NRC risk engineer also raised concerns about the NRC withholding information concerning the risk of flooding. He stated that assertions by NRC's management that plants are "currently able to mitigate flooding events," was false.

David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and safety advocate with the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]]: "The redacted information shows that the NRC is lying to the American public about the safety of U.S. reactors," &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/19/nuclear-plant-flood-threat-leak_n_1983005.htm]

The [[Oconee Nuclear Station]] has been shown to be at particular risk from flooding. An NRC letter dated 2009 states that "a [[Jocassee Dam|Jocassee Dam failure]] is a credible event" It goes on to state that "NRC staff expressed concerns that Duke has not demonstrated that the [null Oconee Nuclear Station] units will be adequately protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=NRC’s July 2011 report on dam failures say that the 2009 letter is not publicly available; this quote ere is taken from the unredacted version of the NRC’s July 2011 report.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NRC's 2011 leaked report notes that "dam failure incidents are common". NRC estimated the odds that dams constructed like Jocassee will fail is about 1 in 3,600 failures per year. Oconee is licensed to operate for another 20 years. The odds of the Jocassee Dam failing over that period are 1 in 180. NRC requires risks to be investigated if they have a frequency of more than 1 in 10,000 years. For a reactor operating over a period of 40 years, these risks must be evaluated if they have a chance greater than a 1 in 250 of occurring.

NRC identified 34 reactors that lie downstream from a total of more than 50 dams. More than half of these dams are roughly the size of the Jocassee dam. Assuming the NRC's failure rate applies to all of these dams, the chance that one will fail over the next 40 years is about 1 in 4 or 25 percent chance. This dam failure rate does not include risks posed by earthquakes or terrorism. Thus, the true probability may be much higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Union of Concerned Scientists, Dam Failures and Flooding at U.S. Nuclear Plant|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/nuclear_power/floods-from-dam-failure-10-19-12.pdf]

This raised a second and potentially larger issue. NRC recently completed its license renewal program which extended the operating licenses of the nation's fleet of nuclear reactors for an additional 20 years. NRC stated that the probability of a severe accident is so incredible that the consequences can be dismissed from the analysis of impacts in its relicensing environmental impact statements (EIS).[[Environmental impact statement]] Yet this conflicts with NRC's internal analyses which concluded that flooding presented a serious human and environmental risk. Critics charge that if these relicensing EISs failed to evaluate the risks of flooding, then how can the public be confident that NRC did not mislead stakeholders concerning other risks such as the potential for a nuclear meltdown.

NRC officials stated in June 2011 that US nuclear safety rules do not adequately weigh the risk of a single event that would knock out electricity from the grid and from emergency generators, as a quake and tsunami did in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/u-s-reactors-unprepared-for-total-power-loss-report-suggests/ |title=U.S. Reactors Unprepared for Total Power Loss, Report Suggests |author=Matthew Wald |date=June 15, 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|10|alt = In October 2011}}, and NRC instructed agency staff to move forward with seven of the 12 safety recommendations put forward by a federal task force in July 2011. The recommendations include "new standards aimed at strengthening operators' ability to deal with a complete loss of power, ensuring plants can withstand floods and earthquakes and improving emergency response capabilities". The new safety standards will take up to five years to fully implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/188767-federal-regulators-agree-to-implement-tighter-nuclear-standards |title=Nuke regulators toughen safety rules |author=Andrew Restuccia |date=2011-10-20 |work=The Hill |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114112850/http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/188767-federal-regulators-agree-to-implement-tighter-nuclear-standards |archivedate=2012-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2011|11|alt = In November 2011}}, Jaczko warned power companies against complacency and said the agency must "push ahead with new rules prompted by the nuclear crisis in Japan, while also resolving long-running issues involving fire protection and a new analysis of earthquake risks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/industries/nrc-chair-warns-nuclear-industry-against-complacency-says-it-must-resolve-long-running-issues/2011/11/10/gIQAq32l9M_story.html |title=NRC chair warns nuclear industry against complacency, says it must resolve long-running issues |date=11 November 2011 |work=Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuclear technology''' is technology that involves the [[nuclear reaction]]s of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. Among the notable nuclear technologies are [[nuclear reactors]], [[nuclear medicine]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s. It is also used, among other things, in [[smoke detector]]s and [[gun sight]]s.

==History and scientific background==

=== Discovery ===
{{main|Nuclear physics}}
The vast majority of common, natural phenomena on Earth only involve [[gravity]] and [[electromagnetism]], and not nuclear reactions. This is because atomic nuclei are generally kept apart because they contain positive electrical charges and therefore repel each other.

In 1896, [[Henri Becquerel]] was investigating [[phosphorescence]] in [[uranium]] salts when he discovered a new phenomenon which came to be called [[radioactivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/becquerel-bio.html|title=Henri Becquerel - Biographical|author=|date=|website=nobelprize.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904065620/https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/becquerel-bio.html|archivedate=4 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, [[Pierre Curie]] and [[Marie Curie]] began investigating the phenomenon. In the process, they isolated the element [[radium]], which is highly radioactive. They discovered that radioactive materials produce intense, penetrating rays of three distinct sorts, which they labeled alpha, beta, and gamma after the first three [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]]. Some of these kinds of radiation could pass through ordinary matter, and all of them could be harmful in large amounts. All of the early researchers received various [[radiation burn]]s, much like [[sunburn]], and thought little of it.

The new phenomenon of radioactivity was seized upon by the manufacturers of [[quack medicine]] (as had the discoveries of [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], earlier), and a number of [[patent medicine]]s and treatments involving radioactivity were put forward.

Gradually it was realized that the radiation produced by radioactive decay was [[ionizing radiation]], and that even quantities too small to burn could pose a [[nuclear safety|severe long-term hazard]]. Many of the scientists working on radioactivity died of [[cancer]] as a result of their exposure. Radioactive patent medicines mostly disappeared, but other applications of radioactive materials persisted, such as the use of radium salts to produce [[Radium Girls|glowing dials on meters]].

As the atom came to be better understood, the nature of radioactivity became clearer. Some larger atomic nuclei are unstable, and so [[radioactive decay|decay]] (release matter or energy) after a random interval. The three forms of [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]] that Becquerel and the Curies discovered are also more fully understood. [[Alpha decay]] is when a nucleus releases an [[alpha particle]], which is two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s, equivalent to a [[helium]] nucleus. [[Beta decay]] is the release of a [[beta particle]], a high-energy [[electron]]. [[Gamma decay]] releases [[gamma rays]], which unlike alpha and beta radiation are not matter but [[electromagnetic radiation]] of very high [[frequency]], and therefore [[energy]]. This type of radiation is the most dangerous and most difficult to block. All three types of radiation occur naturally in [[List of elements by stability of isotopes|certain elements]].

It has also become clear that the ultimate source of most terrestrial energy is nuclear, either through radiation from the [[Sun]] caused by [[Stellar surface fusion|stellar thermonuclear reactions]] or by radioactive decay of uranium within the Earth, the principal source of [[geothermal energy]].

=== Nuclear fission ===
{{main|Nuclear fission}}
In natural nuclear radiation, the byproducts are very small compared to the nuclei from which they originate. Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a nucleus into roughly equal parts, and releasing energy and neutrons in the process. If these neutrons are captured by another unstable nucleus, they can fission as well, leading to a [[chain reaction]]. The average number of neutrons released per nucleus that go on to fission another nucleus is referred to as ''k''. Values of ''k'' larger than 1 mean that the fission reaction is releasing more neutrons than it absorbs, and therefore is referred to as a self-sustaining chain reaction. A mass of fissile material large enough (and in a suitable configuration) to induce a self-sustaining chain reaction is called a [[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]].

When a neutron is captured by a suitable nucleus, fission may occur immediately, or the nucleus may persist in an unstable state for a short time. If there are enough immediate decays to carry on the chain reaction, the mass is said to be [[Prompt criticality|prompt critical]], and the energy release will grow rapidly and uncontrollably, usually leading to an explosion.

When discovered on the eve of [[World War II]], this insight led multiple countries to begin programs investigating the possibility of constructing an [[atomic bomb]] — a weapon which utilized fission reactions to generate far more energy than could be created with chemical explosives. The [[Manhattan Project]], run by the [[United States]] with the help of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]], developed multiple fission weapons which were used against [[Japan]] in 1945 at [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. During the project, the first [[nuclear reactor|fission reactors]] were developed as well, though they were primarily for weapons manufacture and did not generate electricity.

In 1951, the first nuclear fission power plant was the first to produce electricity at the Experimental Breeder Reactor No. 1 (EBR-1), in Arco, Idaho, ushering in the "Atomic Age" of more intensive human energy use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://futurism.com/images/a-brief-history-of-technology/|title=A Brief History of Technology|author=|date=|website=futurism.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423093858/https://futurism.com/images/a-brief-history-of-technology/|archivedate=23 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if the mass is critical only when the delayed neutrons are included, then the reaction can be controlled, for example by the introduction or removal of [[neutron absorber]]s. This is what allows [[nuclear reactor]]s to be built. Fast neutrons are not easily captured by nuclei; they must be slowed (slow neutrons), generally by collision with the nuclei of a [[neutron moderator]], before they can be easily captured. Today, this type of fission is commonly used to generate electricity.

=== Nuclear fusion ===
{{main article|Nuclear fusion}}
{{see also|Timeline of nuclear fusion}}
If nuclei are forced to collide, they can undergo [[nuclear fusion]]. This process may release or absorb energy. When the resulting nucleus is lighter than that of [[iron]], energy is normally released; when the nucleus is heavier than that of iron, energy is generally absorbed. This process of fusion occurs in [[star]]s, which derive their energy from [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]. They form, through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], the light elements ([[lithium]] to [[calcium]]) as well as some of the heavy elements (beyond iron and [[nickel]], via the [[S-process]]). The remaining abundance of heavy elements, from nickel to uranium and beyond, is due to [[supernova nucleosynthesis]], the [[R-process]].

Of course, these natural processes of astrophysics are not examples of nuclear "technology". Because of the very strong repulsion of nuclei, fusion is difficult to achieve in a controlled fashion. [[Hydrogen bomb]]s obtain their enormous destructive power from fusion, but their energy cannot be controlled. Controlled fusion is achieved in [[particle accelerator]]s; this is how many [[synthetic element]]s are produced. A [[fusor]] can also produce controlled fusion and is a useful [[neutron source]]. However, both of these devices operate at a net energy loss. Controlled, viable [[fusion power]] has proven elusive, despite the occasional [[cold fusion|hoax]]. Technical and theoretical difficulties have hindered the development of working civilian fusion technology, though research continues to this day around the world.

Nuclear fusion was initially pursued only in theoretical stages during World War II, when scientists on the Manhattan Project (led by [[Edward Teller]]) investigated it as a method to build a bomb. The project abandoned fusion after concluding that it would require a fission reaction to detonate. It took until 1952 for the first full [[hydrogen]] bomb to be detonated, so-called because it used reactions between [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]. Fusion reactions are much more energetic per unit mass of [[Nuclear fuel|fuel]] than fission reactions, but starting the fusion chain reaction is much more difficult.

== Nuclear weapons ==
{{main|Nuclear weapon}}
A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from [[nuclear reaction]]s, either [[nuclear fission|fission]] or a combination of fission and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]]. Both reactions release vast quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. Even small nuclear devices can devastate a city by blast, fire and radiation. Nuclear weapons are considered [[weapons of mass destruction]], and their use and control has been a major aspect of international policy since their debut.

The [[nuclear weapon design|design of a nuclear weapon]] is more complicated than it might seem. Such a weapon must hold one or more subcritical fissile masses stable for deployment, then induce criticality (create a critical mass) for detonation. It also is quite difficult to ensure that such a chain reaction consumes a significant fraction of the fuel before the device flies apart. The procurement of a [[nuclear fuel]] is also more difficult than it might seem, since sufficiently unstable substances for this process do not currently occur naturally on Earth in suitable amounts.

One [[isotope]] of [[uranium]], namely uranium-235, is naturally occurring and sufficiently unstable, but it is always found mixed with the more stable isotope uranium-238. The latter accounts for more than 99% of the weight of natural uranium. Therefore, some method of [[isotope separation]] based on the weight of three [[neutrons]] must be performed to [[Enriched uranium|enrich]] (isolate) uranium-235.

Alternatively, the element [[plutonium]] possesses an isotope that is sufficiently unstable for this process to be usable. Terrestrial plutonium does not currently occur naturally in sufficient quantities for such use,&lt;ref&gt;"Oklo Fossil Reactors". {{cite web |url=http://www.oklo.curtin.edu.au/index.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218194159/http://www.oklo.curtin.edu.au/index.cfm |archivedate=2007-12-18 |df= }} Curtin University of Technology. Archived from the original on 18 December 2007. Retrieved 15 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; so it must be manufactured in a [[nuclear reactor]].

Ultimately, the [[Manhattan Project]] manufactured nuclear weapons based on each of these elements. They detonated the first nuclear weapon in a [[Nuclear weapons testing|test]] code-named "[[Trinity test|Trinity]]", near [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]], on July 16, 1945. The test was conducted to ensure that the [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion type weapon|implosion method]] of detonation would work, which it did. A uranium bomb, [[Little Boy]], was dropped on the [[Japan]]ese city [[Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945, followed three days later by the plutonium-based [[Fat Man]] on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. In the wake of unprecedented devastation and casualties from a single weapon, the Japanese government soon surrendered, ending [[World War II]].

Since [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|these bombings]], no nuclear weapons have been deployed offensively. Nevertheless, they prompted an [[arms race]] to develop increasingly destructive bombs to provide a [[nuclear deterrent]]. Just over four years later, on August 29, 1949, the [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|Soviet Union]] detonated its [[RDS-1|first fission weapon]]. The [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] followed on October 2, 1952; [[France and weapons of mass destruction|France]], on February 13, 1960; and [[People's Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction|China]] component to a nuclear weapon. Approximately half of the deaths from [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] died two to five years afterward from radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="rerf-deaths"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rerf.or.jp/general/qa_e/qa1.html|title = Frequently Asked Questions #1|publisher = [[Radiation Effects Research Foundation]]|accessdate = 2007-09-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070919143939/http://www.rerf.or.jp/general/qa_e/qa1.html|archivedate = 2007-09-19|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pubmedcentral.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=33859|title=The somatic effects of exposure to atomic radiation: The Japanese experience, 1947–1997|first=William J.|last=Schull|date=12 May 1998|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=95|issue=10|pages=5437–5441|pmid=9576900}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[radiological weapons]] is a type of nuclear weapon designed to distribute hazardous nuclear material in enemy areas. Such a weapon would not have the explosive capability of a fission or fusion bomb, but would kill many people and contaminate a large area. A radiological weapon has never been deployed. While considered useless by a conventional military, such a weapon raises concerns over [[nuclear terrorism]].

There have been [[List of nuclear tests|over 2,000 nuclear tests]] conducted since 1945. In 1963, all nuclear and many non-nuclear states signed the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]], pledging to refrain from [[Nuclear weapons testing|testing nuclear weapons]] in the atmosphere, underwater, or in [[outer space]]. The treaty permitted [[underground nuclear testing]]. France continued atmospheric testing until 1974, while China continued up until 1980. The last underground test by the United States was in 1992, the Soviet Union in 1990, the United Kingdom in 1991, and both France and China continued testing until 1996. After signing the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996 (which had as of 2011 not entered into force), all of these states have pledged to discontinue all nuclear testing. Non-signatories [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]] and [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]] last tested nuclear weapons in 1998.

Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons known - the archetypal [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Throughout the [[Cold War]], the opposing powers had huge nuclear arsenals, sufficient to kill hundreds of millions of people. Generations of people grew up under the shadow of nuclear devastation, portrayed in films such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and ''[[The Atomic Cafe]]''.

However, the tremendous energy release in the detonation of a nuclear weapon also suggested the possibility of a new energy source.

== Civilian uses ==

===Nuclear power===
{{Further|Nuclear power|Nuclear reactor technology}}
Nuclear power is a type of nuclear technology involving the controlled use of nuclear fission to release energy for work including propulsion, heat, and the generation of electricity. Nuclear energy is produced by a controlled nuclear chain reaction which creates heat—and which is used to boil water, produce steam, and drive a steam turbine. The turbine is used to generate electricity and/or to do mechanical work.

Currently nuclear power provides approximately 15.7% of the world's electricity (in 2004) and is used to propel [[aircraft carrier]]s, [[icebreaker]]s and [[submarine]]s (so far economics and fears in some ports have prevented the use of nuclear power in transport ships).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf34.html|title=Nuclear-Powered Ships - Nuclear Submarines - World Nuclear Association|author=|date=|website=world-nuclear.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214062612/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf34.html|archivedate=14 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[nuclear power plant]]s use fission. No man-made fusion reaction has resulted in a viable source of electricity.

===Medical applications===
{{Further|Nuclear medicine}}
The medical applications of nuclear technology are divided into diagnostics and radiation treatment.

Imaging - The largest use of ionizing radiation in [[medicine]] is in [[medical radiography]] to make images of the inside of the human body using x-rays. This is the largest artificial source of radiation exposure for humans. Medical and dental x-ray imagers use of cobalt-60 or other x-ray sources. A number of [[radiopharmaceutical]]s are used, sometimes attached to organic molecules, to act as radioactive tracers or contrast agents in the human body. Positron emitting nucleotides are used for high resolution, short time span imaging in applications known as [[Positron emission tomography]].

Radiation is also used to treat diseases in [[radiation therapy]].

===Industrial applications===

Since some ionizing radiation can penetrate matter, they are used for a variety of measuring methods. X-rays and gamma rays are used in [[industrial radiography]] to make images of the inside of solid products, as a means of [[nondestructive testing]] and inspection. The piece to be radiographed is placed between the source and a photographic film in a cassette. After a certain exposure time, the film is developed and it shows any internal defects of the material.

'''Gauges''' - Gauges use the exponential absorption law of gamma rays
*Level indicators: Source and detector are placed at opposite sides of a container, indicating the presence or absence of material in the horizontal radiation path. Beta or gamma sources are used, depending on the thickness and the density of the material to be measured. The method is used for containers of liquids or of grainy substances
*Thickness gauges: if the material is of constant density, the signal measured by the radiation detector depends on the thickness of the material. This is useful for continuous production, like of paper, rubber, etc.

'''Electrostatic control''' - To avoid the build-up of static electricity in production of paper, plastics, synthetic textiles, etc., a ribbon-shaped source of the alpha emitter &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;[[Americium|Am]] can be placed close to the material at the end of the production line. The source ionizes the air to remove electric charges on the material.

'''[[Radioactive tracer]]s''' - Since radioactive isotopes behave, chemically, mostly like the inactive element, the behavior of a certain chemical substance can be followed by ''tracing'' the radioactivity. Examples:
*Adding a gamma tracer to a gas or liquid in a closed system makes it possible to find a hole in a tube.
*Adding a tracer to the surface of the component of a motor makes it possible to measure wear by measuring the activity of the lubricating oil.

'''Oil and Gas Exploration'''- Nuclear [[well logging]] is used to help predict the commercial viability of new or existing wells. The technology involves the use of a neutron or gamma-ray source and a radiation detector which are lowered into boreholes to determine the properties of the surrounding rock such as porosity and lithography.[http://hps.org/publicinformation/radterms/radfact154.html]

'''Road Construction''' - Nuclear moisture/density gauges are used to determine the density of soils, asphalt, and concrete. Typically a cesium-137 source is used.

===Commercial applications===
*[[radioluminescence]]
*[[tritium illumination]]: [[Tritium]] is used with [[phosphor]] in rifle sights to increase nighttime firing accuracy. Some runway markers and building exit signs use the same technology, to remain illuminated during blackouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/tritium.htm|title=ISU Health Physics Radinf|author=|date=|website=www.physics.isu.edu|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921123842/http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/tritium.htm|archivedate=21 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Betavoltaics]].
*Smoke detector: An ionization [[smoke detector]] includes a tiny mass of radioactive [[americium]]-241, which is a source of [[alpha radiation]]. Two ionisation chambers are placed next to each other. Both contain a small source of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;[[Americium|Am]] that gives rise to a small constant current. One is closed and serves for comparison, the other is open to ambient air; it has a gridded electrode. When smoke enters the open chamber, the current is disrupted as the smoke particles attach to the charged ions and restore them to a neutral electrical state. This reduces the current in the open chamber. When the current drops below a certain threshold, the alarm is triggered.

===Food processing and agriculture===

In [[biology]] and [[agriculture]], radiation is used to induce [[mutation]]s to produce new or improved species. Another use in [[insect control]] is the [[sterile insect technique]], where male insects are sterilized by radiation and released, so they have no offspring, to reduce the population.

In industrial and food applications, radiation is used for [[Radiation sterilization|sterilization]] of tools and equipment. An advantage is that the object may be sealed in plastic before sterilization. An emerging use in [[food production]] is the sterilization of food using [[food irradiation]].

[[File:Radura-Symbol.svg|thumb|150px|right|The [[Radura]] logo, used to show a food has been treated with ionizing radiation.]] 
Food irradiation&lt;ref name="FI"&gt;anon., Food Irradiation - A technique for preserving and improving the safety of food, WHO, Geneva, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of exposing food to [[ionizing radiation]] in order to destroy [[microorganism]]s, [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, or [[insect]]s that might be present in the food. The radiation sources used include radioisotope gamma ray sources, X-ray generators and electron accelerators. Further applications include sprout inhibition, delay of ripening, increase of juice yield, and improvement of re-hydration. [[Irradiation]] is a more general term of deliberate exposure of materials to radiation to achieve a technical goal (in this context 'ionizing radiation' is implied). As such it is also used on non-food items, such as medical hardware, plastics, tubes for gas-pipelines, hoses for floor-heating, shrink-foils for food packaging, automobile parts, wires and cables (isolation), tires, and even gemstones. Compared to the amount of food irradiated, the volume of those every-day applications is huge but not noticed by the consumer.

The genuine effect of processing food by ionizing radiation relates to damages to the [[DNA]], the basic [[DNA sequence|genetic information]] for life. Microorganisms can no longer proliferate and continue their malignant or pathogenic activities. Spoilage causing micro-organisms cannot continue their activities. Insects do not survive or become incapable of procreation. Plants cannot continue the natural ripening or aging process. All these effects are beneficial to the consumer and the food industry, likewise.&lt;ref name="FI"/&gt;

The amount of energy imparted for effective food irradiation is low compared to cooking the same; even at a typical dose of 10 kGy most food, which is (with regard to warming) physically equivalent to water, would warm by only about 2.5&amp;nbsp;°C (4.5&amp;nbsp;°F).

The specialty of processing food by ionizing radiation is the fact, that the energy density per atomic transition is very high, it can cleave molecules and induce ionization (hence the name) which cannot be achieved by mere heating. This is the reason for new beneficial effects, however at the same time, for new concerns. The treatment of solid food by ionizing radiation can provide an effect similar to heat pasteurization of liquids, such as milk. However, the use of the term, cold pasteurization, to describe irradiated foods is controversial, because pasteurization and irradiation are fundamentally different processes, although the intended end results can in some cases be similar.

Detractors of food irradiation have concerns about the health hazards of [[induced radioactivity]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Also, a report for the [[American Council on Science and Health]] entitled "Irradiated Foods" states: "The types of radiation sources approved for the treatment of foods have specific energy levels well below that which would cause any element in food to become radioactive. Food undergoing irradiation does not become any more radioactive than luggage passing through an airport X-ray scanner or teeth that have been X-rayed." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acsh.org/docLib/20040331_irradiated2003.pdf |title=IRRADIATED FOODS Fifth Edition Revised and updated by Paisan Loaharanu May 2003 AMERICAN COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND HEALTH |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926205822/http://www.acsh.org/docLib/20040331_irradiated2003.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food irradiation is currently permitted by over 40 countries and volumes are estimated to exceed {{convert|500000|MT}} annually worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nucleus.iaea.org/NUCLEUS/nucleus/Content/Applications/FICdb/FoodIrradiationClearances.jsp?module=cif NUCLEUS - Food Irradiation Clearances] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526025627/http://nucleus.iaea.org/NUCLEUS/nucleus/Content/Applications/FICdb/FoodIrradiationClearances.jsp?module=cif |date=2008-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Food/Irradiation-Position-ADA.htm Food irradiation, Position of ADA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216174601/http://www.mindfully.org/Food/Irradiation-Position-ADA.htm |date=2016-02-16 }}.

Food irradiation is essentially a non-nuclear technology; it relies on the use of ionizing radiation which may be generated by accelerators for electrons and conversion into bremsstrahlung, but which may use also gamma-rays from nuclear decay. There is a worldwide industry for processing by ionizing radiation, the majority by number and by processing power using accelerators. Food irradiation is only a niche application compared to medical supplies, plastic materials, raw materials, gemstones, cables and wires, etc.

== Accidents ==
{{Main|Nuclear and radiation accidents|Nuclear safety}}

Nuclear accidents, because of the powerful forces involved, are often very dangerous. Historically, the first incidents involved fatal [[Radiation poisoning|radiation exposure]]. [[Marie Curie]] died from [[aplastic anemia]] which resulted from her high levels of exposure. Two scientists, an American and Canadian respectively, [[Harry Daghlian]] and [[Louis Slotin]], died after mishandling the [[Demon core|same plutonium mass]]. Unlike conventional weapons, the intense light, heat, and explosive force is not the only deadly component to a nuclear weapon. Approximately half of the deaths from [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] died two to five years afterward from radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="rerf-deaths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pubmedcentral.nih.gov"/&gt;

Civilian [[List of civilian nuclear accidents|nuclear]] and [[List of civilian radiation accidents|radiological]] accidents primarily involve nuclear power plants. Most common are nuclear leaks that expose workers to hazardous material. A [[nuclear meltdown]] refers to the more serious hazard of releasing nuclear material into the surrounding environment. The most significant meltdowns occurred at [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Ukraine]]. The earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 caused serious damage to three nuclear reactors and a spent fuel storage pond at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. Military reactors that experienced similar accidents were [[Windscale fire|Windscale]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[SL-1]] in the United States.

[[List of military nuclear accidents|Military accidents]] usually involve the loss or unexpected detonation of nuclear weapons. The [[Castle Bravo]] test in 1954 produced a larger yield than expected, which contaminated nearby islands, a Japanese fishing boat (with one fatality), and raised concerns about contaminated [[fish]] in Japan. In the 1950s through 1970s, several nuclear bombs were lost from submarines and aircraft, some of which have never been recovered. The last twenty years{{as of?|date=May 2012}} have seen a marked decline in such accidents.

A '''plug-in electric vehicle''' ('''PEV''') is any [[motor vehicle]] that can be recharged from an external source of electricity, such as [[wall socket]]s, and the electricity stored in the [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable battery packs]] drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of [[electric vehicle]]s that includes [[all-electric vehicle|all-electric or battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs), [[plug-in hybrid vehicle]]s (PHEVs), and [[electric vehicle conversion]]s of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s and conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles.&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book |title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington? |editor=[[David B.

Plug-in cars have several benefits compared to conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles. They have lower operating and maintenance costs, and produce little or no local [[air pollution]]. They reduce dependence on [[petroleum]] and may severally reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, depending on the electricity source, as motors are typically much more efficient than their engine equivalents. [[Plug-in hybrid]]s capture most of these benefits when they are operating in [[all-electric mode]]. Sales of first mass-production plug-in cars by major carmakers began in late December 2010, with the introduction of the all-electric [[Nissan Leaf]] and the plug-in hybrid [[Chevrolet Volt]].

Cumulative global sales of highway legal plug-in electric passenger cars and light utility vehicles achieved the 1&amp;nbsp;million unit milestone in September 2015,&lt;ref name=Global1mi/&gt; 2&amp;nbsp;million in December 2016,&lt;ref name=Global2mi/&gt; the 3&amp;nbsp;million mark in November 2017,&lt;ref name=Global3mi/&gt; and 4&amp;nbsp;million in September 2018.&lt;ref name=Global4mi_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Global4mi_2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Global4mi_3/&gt; Despite the rapid growth experienced, the stock of plug-in electric cars represented just about 1 out of every 300 vehicles on the world's roads by September 2018.&lt;ref name=Global4mi_1/&gt; The global plug-in stock is dominated by all-electrics (BEVs), with about 2.6&amp;nbsp;million (65%) units by November 2018.&lt;ref name=Tesla500K/&gt;  {{As of|2018|10}}, the [[Nissan Leaf]] is the world's top selling highway-capable all-electric car in history, with global sales of 370,000 units.&lt;ref name=Leaf370k/&gt; The [[Tesla Model S]] ranks second with 250,000 units sold worldwide {{as of|2018|09|lc=yes}}.&lt;ref name=ModelS200k/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tesla1Q2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tesla2Q2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tesla3Q2018/&gt;

===Plug-in electric vehicle===
A plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is any [[motor vehicle]] with [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable battery packs]] that can be charged from the [[electric grid]], and the electricity stored on board drives or contributes to drive the wheels for propulsion.&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSE/&gt; Plug-in electric vehicles are also sometimes referred to as grid-enabled vehicles (GEV)&lt;ref name=CSE/&gt; and also as electrically chargeable vehicles.&lt;ref name=ACEA1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acea.be/index.php/news/news_detail/electric_vehicles_turning_buzz_into_reality/ |title=Electric Vehicles: Turning Buzz into Reality |publisher=[[European Automobile Manufacturers Association]] |date=2010-02-09 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PEV is a subcategory of [[electric vehicle]]s that includes [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs), [[plug-in hybrid vehicle]]s, (PHEVs), and [[electric vehicle conversion]]s of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s and conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles.&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energycenter.org/index.php/technical-assistance/transportation/electric-vehicles |title=Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) |publisher=Center for Sustainable Energy, California |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though conventional [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[regenerative braking]], they can not be recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSE/&gt;

===Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles===
{{Main|Plug-in hybrid}}
A [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]] (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a [[hybrid electric vehicle]] with [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]] that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external [[electric power]] source.&lt;ref name=CSE/&gt;&lt;ref name=EERE_PHEV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/electric_basics_phev.html |title=Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Basics |publisher=Alternative Fuels &amp; Advanced Vehicles Data Center, US DoE |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional hybrid electric vehicle and an [[all-electric vehicle]]: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in [[all-electric mode]] until the battery is depleted.&lt;ref name=EERE_PHEV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceage.vt.edu/phev |title=Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) |publisher=Center for Energy and the Global Environment, [[Virginia Tech]] |accessdate=2010-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720110541/http://www.ceage.vt.edu/phev |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/plug-in-hybrid-cars |title=What Is A Plug-in Hybrid Car? |publisher=HybridCars.com |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermarket conversions===
{{See also|Plug-in hybrid#Conversions of production vehicles|l1=Plug-in hybrid conversions|electric vehicle conversion}}
An [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] [[electric vehicle conversion]] is the modification of a conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicle (ICEV) or hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) to [[electricity|electric]] propulsion, creating an [[all-electric]] or [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]].&lt;ref name=PriusPlus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calcars.org/howtoget.html |title=How to Get a Plug-In Hybrid |publisher=[[CalCars]] |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/plug-in-hybrid-cars#conversion |title=Plug-in Hybrid Conversions |publisher=HybridCars.com |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/decision-process/top-7-issues-electric-car-conversion-25839.html |title=Top 7 Issues for an Electric Car Conversion |publisher=HybridCars.com |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2010-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527093732/http://www.hybridcars.com/decision-process/top-7-issues-electric-car-conversion-25839.html |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several companies in the U.S. offering conversions. The most common conversions have been from hybrid electric cars to plug-in hybrid, but due to the different technology used in hybrids by each carmaker, the easiest conversions are for 2004–2009 [[Toyota Prius]] and for the [[Ford Escape Hybrid|Ford Escape/Mercury Mariner Hybrid]].&lt;ref name=PriusPlus/&gt;

===New energy vehicles===
In [[China]] the term new energy vehicles (NEVs) refers to vehicles that are partially or fully powered by electricity, such as [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs) and [[plug-in hybrid]]s (PHEVs). The Chinese government began implementation of its NEV program in 2009 to foster the development and introduction of new energy vehicles.&lt;ref name=NEVs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTNEWSCHINESE/Resources/3196537-1202098669693/EV_Report_en.pdf |title=The China New Energy Vehicles Program – Challenges and Opportunities |author=PRTM Management Consultants, Inc. |publisher=[[World Bank]] |date=April 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-22}} ''See Acronyms and Key Terms, pp. v''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

&lt;!--Please keep the content of these sub-sections brief, as most of the content is treated in more detail in the respective BEV, electric car and PHEV article, or in the articles linked in the "See also" pointers--&gt;


PEVs have several advantages. These include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, noise reduction and national security benefits. According to the [[Center for American Progress]], PEVs are an important part of the group of technologies that will help the U.S. meet its goal under the [[Paris Agreement]], which is a 26-28 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/reports/2018/07/30/454084/investing-charging-infrastructure-plug-electric-vehicles/|title=Investing in Charging Infrastructure for Plug-In Electric Vehicles - Center for American Progress|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lower operating and maintenance costs ===
[[Internal combustion engine]]s are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion as most of the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. [[Electric motor]]s, on the other hand, are more [[thermal efficiency|efficient]] at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. [[Electric drive vehicle]]s do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through [[regenerative braking]].&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{Cite book |last=[[Daniel Sperling|Sperling, Daniel]] and Deborah Gordon |title=Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year=2009 |pages=22–26 and 114–139 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], New York |isbn=978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, conventional [[gasoline engine]]s effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and [[diesel engine]]s can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.&lt;ref name=PEVs2&gt;{{cite book |author=Saurin D.

[[File:11-09-04-iaa-by-RalfR-111.jpg|thumb|left|The operating cost of the [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]] in the U.S. is estimated at {{USD|0.03}} per mile while operating in [[all-electric mode]].&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt;&lt;ref name=PopularM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/4215681 |title=How Much Is That Hybrid Electric Really Saving You? |author=Emily Masamitsu |publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the United States, as of early 2010 with a national average electricity rate of {{USD|0.10}} per [[kWh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/epm_sum.html |title=Electric Power Monthly: June 2010 Edition |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |date=June 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}'' Prices correspond to average for March 2010 for the U.S. energy generation mix that month.''&lt;/ref&gt; the cost per mile for a plug-in electric vehicle operating in [[all-electric mode]] is estimated between $0.02 to $0.04, while the cost per mile of a standard automobile varies between $0.08 to $0.20, considering a gasoline price of $3.00 per gallon.&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt; As [[petroleum price]] is expected to increase in the future due to [[peak oil|oil production decline]] and increases in global demand, the cost difference in favor of PEVs is expected to become even more advantageous.&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt;

According to [[Consumer Reports]], as of December 2011 the [[Nissan Leaf]] has a cost of 3.5 cents per mile and the Chevrolet Volt has a cost in electric mode of 3.8 cents per mile. The Volt cost per mile is higher because it is heavier than the Leaf. These estimates are based on the fuel economy and energy consumption measured on their tests and using a U.S. national average rate of 11 cents per kWh of electricity. When the Volt runs in [[range-extended mode]] using its premium gasoline-powered engine, the plug-in hybrid has a cost of 12.5 cents per mile. The out-of-pocket cost per mile of the three most fuel efficient gasoline-powered cars as tested by the magazine are the [[Toyota Prius (XW30)|Toyota Prius]], with a cost of 8.6 cents per miles, the [[Honda Civic Hybrid]] with 9.5 cents per mile, the [[Toyota Corolla#Tenth generation (E140, E150)|Toyota Corolla]] with 11.9 cents per mile, and the [[Hyundai Elantra#Fifth generation (MD; 2010–present)|Hyundai Elantra]] 13.1 cents per mile. The analysis also found that on trips up to {{Convert|100|mi|abbr=on}}, the Volt is cheaper to drive than the Prius and the other three cars due to the Volt's {{Convert|35|mi|abbr=on}} driving range on electricity. The previous operating costs do not include maintenance, depreciation or other costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/12/leaf-volt-tests-show-electric-cars-cost-less-per-mile-to-operate.html |title=Leaf, Volt tests show electric cars cost less per mile to operate |author=Eric Evarts |work=[[Consumer Reports]] |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[All-electric vehicle|All-electric]] and plug-in hybrid vehicles also have lower maintenance costs as compared to internal combustion vehicles, since electronic systems break down much less often than the mechanical systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer mechanical systems on board last longer due to the better use of the electric engine. PEVs do not require oil changes and other routine maintenance checks.&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;

The [[Edison Electric Institute]] (EEI) conducted an analysis that demonstrated that between January 1976 and February 2012 the real price for gasoline has been much more volatile than the real price of electricity in the United States. The analysis is based on a plug-in electric vehicle with an efficiency of 3.4 miles per kW-hr (like the [[Mitsubishi i MiEV]]) and a gasoline-powered vehicle with a fuel economy rated at {{Convert|30|mpgUS|abbr=on}} (like the [[Fiat 500 (2007)|2012 Fiat 500]]). The EEI estimated that operating a plug-in would have had an equivalent cost of around {{USD|1.50}} a gallon in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and around {{USD|1.00}} a gallon since the late 1990s. In contrast, the price to operate an internal combustion engine vehicle has had much ample variations, costing more than {{USD|3.50}} per gallon during the [[1979 energy crisis]], then had a couple of lows with prices at less than {{USD|1.50}} during 1999 and 2001, only to climb and reach a maximum of more than {{USD|4.00}} before the beginning of the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis|2007–2009 financial crisis]], by early 2012 has fluctuated around {{USD|3.50}}. The analysis found that the cost of an equivalent electric-gallon of gasoline would have been not only cheaper to operate during the entire analysis period but also that equivalent electricity prices are more stable and have been declining in terms of equivalent dollars per gallon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eei.org/ourissues/EnergyEfficiency/Documents/PEV_domestic_fuel.pdf |title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: Fueled by Affordable, Diverse, Domestic Energy |author=[[Edison Electric Institute]] (EEI) |publisher=EEI |date=April 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eei.org/ourissues/EnergyEfficiency/Documents/Prices_graph_2012.pdf |title=National Average Monthly Gasoline Retail Price v.

===Air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions===
{{See also|Electric car#Air pollution and carbon emissions|l1=Air pollution and carbon emissions in electric cars|Plug-in hybrid#Greenhouse gas emissions|l2=Greenhouse gas emissions in plug-in hybrids}}
[[File:Prius RechargeIT 03 2008 at Google's campus.jpg|thumb|[[RechargeIT]] converted [[Toyota Prius]] [[plug-in hybrid]]s at [[Google]]'s [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] campus. The garage has [[Charging station|recharging facilities]] powered by [[solar panel]]s.]]
[[Electric car]]s, as well as [[plug-in hybrid]]s operating in [[all-electric mode]], emit no harmful [[motor vehicle emissions|tailpipe pollutants]] from the onboard source of power, such as [[particulate]]s ([[soot]]), [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], [[ozone]], [[lead]], and various [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]]. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt; In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles operating in all-electric mode do not emit [[greenhouse gases]] from the onboard source of power, but from the point of view of a [[Tank-to-wheel|well-to-wheel assessment]], the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for [[electricity generation]]. This fact has been referred to as [[the long tailpipe]] of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full [[life cycle analysis]], the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as [[wind power|wind]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[hydroelectric]], or [[nuclear power]] for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions.&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt;&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt; On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from [[coal]]-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles and higher than [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciMag&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=interactive-plug-in-hybrids |title=The Dirty Truth about Plug-in Hybrids, Made Interactive |publisher=Scientific American |date=July 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}} ''Click on the map to see the results for each region.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]].&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt;

The magnitude of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region. For example, [[France]] can obtain significant emission benefits from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by [[nuclear power plants]]; similarly, most regions of [[Canada]] are primarily powered with [[hydroelectricity]], nuclear, or [[natural gas]] which have no or very low emissions at point of generation; and the state of [[California]], where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear plants can also secure substantial emission benefits. The [[United Kingdom]] also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as [[natural gas]] plants dominate the generation mix. On the other hand, emission benefits in [[Germany]], [[China]], [[India]], and the central regions of the [[United States]] are limited or non-existent because most electricity is generated from [[coal]].&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Palm |first=Erik |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10231102-54.html |title=Study: Electric cars not as green as you think &amp;#124; Green Tech – CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these countries and regions might still obtain some air quality benefits by reducing local air pollution in urban areas. Cities with chronic [[air pollution]] problems, such as [[Los Angeles]], [[México City]], [[Santiago, Chile]], [[São Paulo]], [[Beijing]], [[Bangkok]] and [[Kathmandu]] may also gain local clean air benefits by shifting the harmful emission to electric generation plants located outside the cities. Nevertheless, the location of the plants is not relevant when considering greenhouse gas emission because their effect is global.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;

====Carbon footprint during production====
;Ricardo
A report published in June 2011, prepared by [[Ricardo plc|Ricardo]] in collaboration with experts from the UK's Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership, found that hybrid electric cars, plug-in hybrids and all-electric cars generate more carbon emissions during their production than current conventional vehicles, but still have a lower overall [[carbon footprint]] over the full life cycle. The higher carbon footprint during production of [[electric drive vehicle]]s is due mainly to the production of batteries. As an example, 43 percent of production emissions for a [[mid-size car|mid-size]] electric car are generated from the battery production, while for standard mid-sized gasoline[[internal combustion engine]] vehicle, around 75% of the embedded carbon emissions during production comes from the [[steel]] used in the [[vehicle glider]].&lt;ref name=Ricardo2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/lowcvp-20110608.html |title=Ricardo study finds electric and hybrid cars have a higher carbon footprint during production than conventional vehicles, but still offer a lower footprint over the full life cycle |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table summarizes key results of this study for four powertrain technologies:

The Ricardo study also found that the lifecycle carbon emissions for mid-sized gasoline and diesel vehicles are almost identical, and that the greater fuel efficiency of the diesel engine is offset by higher production emissions.&lt;ref name=Ricardo2011/&gt;

;Volkswagen
In 2014 [[Volkswagen]] published the results of [[life-cycle assessment]] of its electric vehicles certified by [[TÜV NORD]], and independent inspection agency. The study found that {{chem|CO|2}} emissions during the use phase of its all-electric [[VW e-Golf]] are 99% lower than those of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk7|Golf 1.2 TSI]] when powers comes from exclusively [[hydroelectricity]] generated in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Accounting for the full lifecycle, the e-Golf reduces emissions by 61%, offsetting higher production emissions. When the actual [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|EU-27]] electricity mix is considered, the e-Golf emissions are still 26% lower than those of the conventional Golf 1.2 TSI. Similar results were found when comparing the e-Golf with the Golf 1.6 TDI. The analysis considered [[recycling]] of the three vehicles at the end of their lifetime.&lt;ref name=VWemobility&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/03/20140313-golf.html |title=Volkswagen: e-mobility and sustainability; Part 1, the e-Golf and Golf GTE |author=Mike Millikin |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2014-03-13}} ''See the infograph [http://bioage.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4fbe53ef01a51183f250970c-popup CO2 emissions over the full life-cycle (t CO2e)].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Total emissions include the emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity used to charge the vehicle, and for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, it also includes emissions associated with tailpipe emissions produced from the [[internal combustion engine]]. These figures were published by the EPA in October 2014 in its annual report "''Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends: 1975 Through 2014''." All emissions are estimated considering average real world city and highway operation based on the EPA 5-cycle label methodology, using a weighted 55% city and 45% highway driving. For the first time, the ''2014 Trends ''report presents an analysis of the impact of [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s, with emphasis in plug-in electric vehicles because as their market share is approaching 1%, the EPA concluded that PEVs began to have a measurable impact on the U.S. overall new vehicle fuel economy and {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref name=EPAtrends2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCCtrends&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/10/20141011-trends.html |title=EPA Trends on EVs and PHEVs; beginning of a "measurable and meaningful impact" on new vehicle fuel economy and emissions |author=Mike Millikin |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2014-10-11 |accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For purposes of an accurate estimation of emissions, the analysis took into consideration the differences in operation between plug-in hybrids. Some, like the [[Chevrolet Volt]], can operate in [[all-electric mode]] without using gasoline, and others operate in a blended mode like the [[Toyota Prius PHV]], which uses both energy stored in the battery and energy from the gasoline tank to propel the vehicle, but that can deliver substantial all-electric driving in blended mode. In addition, since the [[all-electric range]] of plug-in hybrids depends on the size of the battery pack, the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection of the share of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver, for both, electric only and blended EV modes. Since all-electric cars do not produce tailpipe emissions, the utility factor applies only to plug-in hybrids. The following table shows the overall fuel economy expressed in terms of [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (mpg-e) and the utility factor for the ten MY2014 plug-in hybrids available in the U.S. market, and EPA's best estimate of the {{CO2}} [[tailpipe emissions]] produced by these PHEVs.&lt;ref name=EPAtrends2014/&gt;

In order to account for the upstream {{CO2}} emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity, and since electricity production in the United States varies significantly from region to region, the EPA considered three scenarios/ranges with the low end scenario corresponding to the California powerplant emissions factor, the middle of the range represented by the national average powerplant emissions factor, and the upper end of the range corresponding to the powerplant emissions factor for the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The EPA estimates that the electricity GHG emission factors for various regions of the country vary from 346 g {{CO2}}/[[kWh]] in California to 986 g {{CO2}}/kWh in the Rockies, with a national average of 648 g {{CO2}}/kWh.&lt;ref name=EPAtrends2014/&gt;

;Union of Concerned Scientists
The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) published a study in 2012 that assessed average greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. resulting from charging plug-in car batteries from the perspective of the full life-cycle ([[well-to-wheel]] analysis) and according to fuel and technology used to generate electric power by region. The study used the [[model year]] 2011 [[Nissan Leaf]] all-electric car to establish the analysis baseline, and electric-utility emissions are based on EPA's 2009 estimates. The UCS study expressed the results in terms of [[miles per gallon]] instead of the conventional unit of grams of greenhouse gases or [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] emissions per year in order to make the results more friendly for consumers. The study found that in areas where electricity is generated from natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric or renewable sources, the potential of plug-in electric cars to reduce greenhouse emissions is significant. On the other hand, in regions where a high proportion of power is generated from coal, [[hybrid electric car]]s produce less {{CO2}} equivalent emissions than plug-in electric cars, and the best fuel efficient gasoline-powered [[subcompact car]] produces slightly less emissions than a PEV. In the worst-case scenario, the study estimated that for a region where all energy is generated from coal, a plug-in electric car would emit greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to a gasoline car rated at a combined city/highway driving fuel economy of {{Convert|30|mpgUS|abbr=on}}. In contrast, in a region that is completely reliant on natural gas, the PEV would be equivalent to a gasoline-powered car rated at {{Convert|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=UCS2012EVs/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTCO201&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/automobiles/how-green-are-electric-cars-depends-on-where-you-plug-in.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1&amp;pagewanted=all |title=How Green Are Electric Cars? Depends on Where You Plug In |author=Paul Stenquist |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study concluded that for 45% of the U.S. population, a plug-in electric car will generate lower {{CO2}} equivalent emissions than a gasoline-powered car capable of combined {{Convert|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Toyota Prius (XW30)|Toyota Prius]] and the [[Prius c]]. The UCS also found that for 37% of the population, the electric car emissions will fall in the range of a gasoline-powered car rated at a combined fuel economy of {{Convert|41|to|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Honda Civic Hybrid#Third generation (2011- )|Honda Civic Hybrid]] and the [[Lexus CT200h]]. Only 18% of the population lives in areas where the power-supply is more dependent on burning carbon, and the greenhouse gas emissions will be equivalent to a car rated at a combined fuel economy of {{Convert|31|to|40|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Chevrolet Cruze#2008–present (J300)|Chevrolet Cruze]] and [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Ford Focus]].&lt;ref name=NYTCO201/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTCO202&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/13/automobiles/Sorting-Out-the-Power-Grid.html?emc=eta1 |title=Carbon In, Carbon Out: Sorting Out the Power Grid |author=Paul Stenquist |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2012-04-14}} ''See map for regional results''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTCO203&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2012/04/15/automobiles/15POWERemissions-ch.html?ref=automobiles |title=When it Comes to Carbon Dioxide, Lower is Better and Zero is Perfect |author=Paul Stenquist |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that there are no regions in the U.S. where plug-in electric cars will have higher greenhouse gas emissions than the average new compact gasoline engine automobile, and the area with the dirtiest power supply produces {{CO2}} emissions equivalent to a gasoline-powered car rated at {{Convert|33|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=UCS2012EVs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf |title=State of Charge: Electric Vehicles' Global Warming Emissions and Fuel-Cost Savings across the United States |author1=Don Anair |author2=Amine Mahmassani |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |date=April 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-16}} ''pp. 16–20''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 the UCS published an updated analysis of its 2012 report. The 2014 analysis found that 60% of Americans, up from 45% in 2009, live in regions where an all-electric car produce fewer {{CO2}} equivalent emissions per mile than the most efficient hybrid. The UCS study found several reasons for the improvement. First, electric utilities have adopted cleaner sources of electricity to their mix between the two analysis. The 2014 study used electric-utility emissions based on EPA's 2010 estimates, but since coal use nationwide is down by about 5% from 2010 to 2014, actual efficiency in 2014 is better than estimated in the UCS study. Second, electric vehicles have become more efficient, as the average 2013 all-electric vehicle used 0.33 kWh per mile, representing a 5% improvement over 2011 models. Also, some new models are cleaner than the average, such as the [[BMW i3]], which is rated at 0.27 kWh by the EPA. An i3 charged with power from the Midwest grid would be as clean as a gasoline-powered car with about {{Convert|50|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}}, up from {{Convert|39|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} for the average electric car in the 2012 study. In states with a cleaner mix generation, the gains were larger. The average all-electric car in California went up to {{Convert|95|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} equivalent from {{Convert|78|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} in the 2012 study. States with dirtier generation that rely heavily on coal still lag, such as Colorado, where the average BEV only achieves the same emissions as a {{Convert|34|mpgUS|abbr=on}} gasoline-powered car. The author of the 2014 analysis noted that the benefits are not distributed evenly across the U.S. because electric car adoptions is concentrated in the states with cleaner power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/automobiles/coal-fades-so-electrics-get-cleaner.html |title=Coal Fades, So Electrics Get Cleaner |author=Paul Stenquist |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2014-09-19 |accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/how-do-electric-cars-compare-with-gas-cars-656?_ga=1.204480851.2146914018.1410916275 |title=How do EVs Compare with Gas-Powered Vehicles?

[[File:UCS EV Global warming emissions US.png|thumb|300px|Change from 2009 to 2012 of the percentage of Americans that live in regions where powering an electric vehicle on the regional electricity grid produces lower global warming emissions than a gasoline car expressed in terms of combined cith/highway fuel economy rating.

In November 2015 the Union of Concerned Scientists published a new report comparing two [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs) with similar gasoline vehicles by examining their global warming emissions over their full life-cycle, [[Life-cycle assessment#Cradle-to-grave|cradle-to-grave]] analysis. The two BEVs modeled, midsize and full-size, are based on the two most popular BEV models sold in the United States in 2015, the Nissan Leaf and the [[Tesla Model S]]. The study found that all-electric cars representative of those sold today, on average produce less than half the global warming emissions of comparable gasoline-powered vehicles, despite taken into account the higher emissions associated with BEV manufacturing. Considering the regions where the two most popular electric cars are being sold, excess manufacturing emissions are offset within 6 to 16 months of average driving. The study also concluded that driving an average EV results in lower global warming emissions than driving a gasoline car that gets {{Convert|50|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} in regions covering two-thirds of the U.S. population, up from 45% in 2009. Based on where EVs are being sold in the United States in 2015, the average EV produces global warming emissions equal to a gasoline vehicle with a {{Convert|68|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} fuel economy rating. The authors identified two main reason for the fact that EV-related emissions have become even lower in many parts of the country since the first study was conducted in 2012. Electricity generation has been getting cleaner, as coal-fired generation has declined while lower-carbon alternatives have increased. In addition, electric cars are becoming more efficient. For example, the Nissan Leaf and the [[Chevrolet Volt]], have undergone improvements to increase their efficiencies compared to the original models launched in 2010, and other even more efficient BEV models, such as the most lightweight and efficient [[BMW i3]], have entered the market.&lt;ref name=UCS2015&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf |title=Cleaner Cars from Cradle to Grave: How Electric Cars Beat Gasoline Cars on Lifetime Global Warming Emissions |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) |last1=Nealer |first1=Rachael |last2=Reichmuth |first2=David |last3=Anair |first3=Don |date=November 2015 |accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/11/17/ucs-evs-cleaner-than-gas-cars/ |title=UCS: Well-to-wheel, EVs cleaner than pretty much all gas cars |author=Sebastian Blanco |work=Autoblog (website) |date=2015-11-17 |accessdate=2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One criticism to the UCS study is that the analysis was made using average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation at different times of the day. The former approach does not take into account the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21634544-are-zero-emission-vehicles-cleaner-petrol-cars-it-all-depends-zevs-invisible |title=The ZEV’s invisible tailpipe – Are zero-emission vehicles cleaner than petrol cars?

See pp. 251&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis by three economist affiliated with the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The marginal analysis, applied to plug-in electric vehicles, found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, {{CO2}} emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. The results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired units, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas units, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand.&lt;ref name=NBER2014/&gt;

====Well-to-wheel GHG emissions in several countries====
A study published in the UK in April 2013 assessed the carbon footprint of plug-in electric vehicles in 20 countries. As a baseline the analysis established that manufacturing emissions account for 70 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/km for an electric car and 40 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/km for a petrol car. The study found that in countries with coal-intensive generation, PEVs are no different from conventional petrol-powered vehicles. Among these countries are China, Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and India. A pure electric car in India generates emissions comparable to a {{convert|20|mpgUS|abbr=on}} petrol car.&lt;ref name=Guardian022013/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVEM032013/&gt;

The country ranking was led by [[Paraguay]], where all electricity is produced from [[hydropower]], and [[Iceland]], where electricity production relies on [[renewable power]], mainly hydro and [[geothermal power]]. Resulting carbon emissions from an electric car in both countries are 70 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/km, which is equivalent to a {{convert|220|mpgUS|abbr=on}} petrol car, and correspond to manufacturing emissions. Next in the ranking are other countries with low carbon electricity generation, including Sweden (mostly hydro and nuclear power ), Brazil (mainly hydropower) and France (predominantly [[nuclear power]]). Countries ranking in the middle include Japan, Germany, the UK and the United States.&lt;ref name=Guardian022013&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/feb/07/india-green-country-electric-cars |title=India named least green country for electric cars |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2013-02-07 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AVEM032013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avem.fr/news?id=3964 |title=Véhicules électriques et émissions de CO2 – de 70 à 370 g CO2/km selon les pays |language=French|trans-title=Electric Vehicles and CO2 emissions – 70 to 370 g CO2/km by country |author=Michaël Torregrossa |publisher=Association pour l'Avenir du Véhicule Electrique Méditerranéen (AVEM) |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ShadeOG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/electric-car-emissions#.UWMjH5xsYH4.email |title=Shades of Green: Electric Cars’ Carbon Emissions Around the Globe |author=Lindsay Wilson |publisher=Shrink That Footprint |date=February 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brent Spot monthly.svg|thumb|Evolution of oil prices since 1987 (average [[Brent crude|Brent]] [[spot price]]s – adjusted for U.S. inflation).]]

For many net oil importing countries the [[2000s energy crisis]] brought back concerns first raised during the [[1973 oil crisis]]. For the [[United States energy independence|United States]], the other [[developed countries]] and [[emerging countries]] their dependence on foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price [[Shock (economics)|shocks]] and [[supply (economics)|supply]] [[Energy security|disruption]]. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding [[peak oil|peak oil production]] and the higher cost of extracting [[unconventional oil]]. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to [[national security]] because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong [[resource nationalism]], unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinventing&gt;{{cite book |title=Reinventing the Automobile: Personal Urban Mobility for the 21st Century |last1=Mitchell |first1=William J. |last2=Borroni-Bird |first2=Christopher |last3=Burns |first3=Lawrence D. |year=2010 |publisher=[[The MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-01382-6 |edition=1st. |url=http://ilp.mit.edu/webpubdetail.jsp?id=40 |pages=85–95}} ''See Chapter 5: Clean Smart Energy Supply.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs1&gt;{{cite book |author=[[R.

=== Cost of batteries and cost of ownership ===
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}

;Cost of batteries
{{As of|2015}}, plug-in electric vehicles are significantly more expensive as compared to conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles and [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s due to the additional cost of their [[lithium-ion battery]] pack. According to a 2010 study by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], the cost of a lithium-ion battery pack was about {{USD|1,700}}/[[kWh]] of usable energy, and considering that a [[Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle|PHEV]]-10 requires about 2.0&amp;nbsp;kWh and a PHEV-40 about 8&amp;nbsp;kWh, the manufacturer cost of the battery pack for a PHEV-10 is around {{USD|3,000}} and it goes up to {{USD|14,000}} for a PHEV-40.&lt;ref name=NRC09_1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12826&amp;page=2 |title=Transitions to Alternative Transportation Technologies—Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles |publisher=The National Academies Press |author=[[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1209&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/business/15hybrid.html?_r=2&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=plug-in%20hybrid&amp;st=cse |title=Study Says Big Impact of the Plug-In Hybrid Will Be Decades Away |publisher=New York Times |date=2009-12-14 |accessdate=2010-03-04 |author1=Jad Mouawad |author2=Kate Galbraith |lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012|06}}, and based on the three battery size options offered for the [[Tesla Model S]], the [[New York Times]] estimated the cost of automotive battery packs between {{USD|400}} to {{USD|500}} per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/tesla-model-s-offers-a-lesson-in-electric-vehicle-economics/?ref=automobiles |title=Tesla Model S Offers a Lesson in Electric-Vehicle Economics |author=Paul Stenquist |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study by the [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] reported that battery costs came down from {{USD|1,300}} per kWh in 2007 to {{USD|500}} per kWh in 2012. The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] has set cost targets for its sponsored battery research of {{USD|300}} per kWh in 2015 and {{USD|125}} per kWh by 2022. Cost reductions through advances in battery technology and higher production volumes will allow plug-in electric vehicles to be more competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/publications/researchreports/t133.pdf |title=Plug-in Electric Vehicles: Challenges and Opportunities |author1=Siddiq Khan |author2=Martin Kushler |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] |date=June 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-09}} ''ACEEE Report Number T133''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study published in February 2016 by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), battery prices fell 65% since 2010, and 35% just in 2015, reaching {{USD|350}} per kWh. The study concludes that battery costs are on a trajectory to make electric vehicles without government subsidies as affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by 2022. BNEF projects that by 2040, long-range electric cars will cost less than {{USD|22,000}} expressed in 2016 dollars. BNEF expects electric car battery costs to be well below {{USD|120}} per kWh by 2030, and to fall further thereafter as new chemistries become available.&lt;ref name=BNEF2015/&gt;

;Cost of ownership
A study published in 2011 by the [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs|Belfer Center]], [[Harvard University]], found that the gasoline costs savings of plug-in electric cars do not offset their higher purchase prices when comparing their lifetime [[net present value]] of purchase and operating costs for the U.S. market at 2010 prices, and assuming no [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#United States|government subidies]]. According to the study estimates, a PHEV-40 is {{USD|5,377}} more expensive than a conventional internal combustion engine, while a battery electric vehicles is {{USD|4,819}} more expensive.&lt;ref name=KSG11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21216/will_electric_cars_transform_the_us_vehicle_market.html?hq_e=el&amp;hq_m=1303999&amp;hq_l=5&amp;hq_v=4613decb42 |title=Will Electric Cars Transform the U.S. Vehicle Market? |author1=Henry Lee |author2=Grant Lovellette |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]], [[Kennedy School of Government]] |date=July 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings assumed a battery cost of {{USD|600}} per [[kWh]], which means that the [[Chevrolet Volt]] battery pack cost around {{USD|10,000}} and the [[Nissan Leaf]] pack costs {{USD|14,400}}. The study also assumed a gasoline price of {{USD|3.75}} per gallon (as of mid June 2011), that vehicles are driven {{Convert|12,000|mi}} per year, an average price of electricity of {{USD|0.12}} per kWh, that the plug-in hybrid is driven in [[all-electric mode]] 85% of the time, and that the owner of PEVs pay {{USD|1,500}} to install a [[Level 1, 2, and 3 charging|Level II 220/240 volt charger]] at home.&lt;ref name=KSGpdf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/Lee%20Lovellette%20Electric%20Vehicles%20DP%202011%20web.pdf |title=WillElectric Cars Transform the U.S. Vehicle Market? |author1=Henry Lee |author2=Grant Lovellette |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]], [[Kennedy School of Government]] |date=July 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-07}} Discussion Paper #2011-08, pages 9–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study also include [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s in the comparison, and analyzed several scenarios to determine how the comparative net savings will change over the next 10 to 20 years, assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increase, and also assuming higher fuel efficiency of conventional cars, among other scenarios. Under the future scenarios considered, the study found that BEVs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars ({{USD|1,155}} to {{USD|7,181}} cheaper), while PHEVs, will be more expensive than BEVs in almost all comparison scenarios, and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very low battery costs and high gasoline prices. The reason for the different savings among PEVs is because BEVs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel, while PHEVs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines. The following table summarizes the results of four of the seven scenarios analyzed by the study.&lt;ref name=KSGpdf/&gt;

According to a study by the [[Electric Power Research Institute]] published in June 2013, the [[total cost of ownership]] of the 2013 Nissan Leaf SV is substantially lower than that of comparable conventional and hybrid vehicles. For comparison, the study constructed average hybrid and conventional vehicles and assumed an average US distance per trip distribution. The study took into account the manufacturer's suggested retail price, taxes, credits, destination charge, electric [[charging station]], fuel cost, maintenance cost, and additional cost due to the use of a gasoline vehicle for trips beyond the range of the Leaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.plugincars.com/total-cost-ownership-cheaper-electric-cars-study-proves-127503.html |title=Power Institute Study: Total Cost of Ownership Cheaper for Electric Cars |author=Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield |date=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance to build the infrastructure necessary to support electric vehicles is illustrated by the decision of [[Car2Go]] in [[San Diego]], California, that due to insufficient charging infrastructure decided to replace all of its all-electric car fleet with gasoline-powered cars starting on 1 May 2016. When the carsharing service started in 2011, Car2Go expected 1,000 charging stations to be deployed around the city, but only 400 were in place by early 2016. As a result, an average of 20% of the carsharing fleet is unavailable at any given time because the cars are either being charged or because they don’t have enough electricity in them to be driven. Also, many of the company’s 40,000 San Diego members say they often worry their Car2Go will run out of charge before they finish their trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/mar/16/car-share-car2go-fleet-gas-electric/ |title=Car2Go switching electric cars to gas |first=David |last=Garrick |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=2016-03-16 |accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battery swapping====

[[File:Better Place Charging Station IMG 6670.jpg|thumb|[[Better Place (company)|Better Place]]'s battery switching station in Israel]]
A different approach to resolve the problems of [[range anxiety]] and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by [[Better Place (company)|Better Place]]. Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack. As customers are not allowed to purchase battery packs, they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery swapping stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of [[sustainable energy|sustainable electricity]], and other costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/01/renault-nissan.html |title=Renault-Nissan and Project Better Place Sign MoU for Mass Marketed EVs in Israel; Implementing New Ownership Model |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXfqGL3C2uI |people=[[Shai Agassi]], [[David Pogue]], [[Gavin Newsom]] |date=2009-03-19 |title=Making The World A 'Better Place' |medium=[[YouTube]] |publisher=CBS News Sunday Morning; CBS Interactive, Inc. |location=San Francisco, CA |time=3:45 |quote=Shai Agassi: "We [Better Place] don't let you [the customer] buy a battery; we [Better Place] buy the battery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Better Place signed agreement for deployment in [[Australia]], [[Denmark]], [[Israel]], [[Canada]], [[California]], and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/better-place-unveils-electric-car-software/?scp=8&amp;sq=Better%20Place&amp;st=cse |title=Better Place Unveils Electric-Car Software |publisher=New York Times |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2010-05-16 |first=Todd |last=Woody}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Renault Fluence Z.E.]] was the electric car built with switchable battery technology sold for the Better Place network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betterplace.com/the-company-multimedia-photos/index/id/72157623854339020 |title=Better Place.

After implementing the first modern commercial deployment of the battery swapping model in Israel and Denmark, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about {{USD|850}} million in private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi. Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/business/global/israeli-electric-car-company-files-for-liquidation.html?_r=0 |title=Israeli Venture Meant to Serve Electric Cars Is Ending Its Run |author=Isabel Kershner |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2013-05-26 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JPost052613&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-News/Death-of-Better-Place-Electric-car-co-to-dissolve-314380 |title=Death of Better Place: Electric car co. to dissolve |author=Niv Elis |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=2013-05-26 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential overload of the electrical grid ===

The existing [[electrical grid]], and local [[transformer]]s in particular, may not have enough capacity to handle the additional [[electric power|power]] load that might be required in certain areas with high plug-in electric car concentrations. As recharging a single electric-drive car could consume three times as much electricity as a typical home, overloading problems may arise when several vehicles in the same neighborhood recharge at the same time, or during the normal summer peak loads. To avoid such problems, utility executives recommend owners to charge their vehicles overnight when the grid load is lower or to use smarter electric meters that help control demand. When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to recharging to avoid blackouts due to grid overload. Also, some experts have suggested that by implementing variable time-of-day rates, utilities can provide an incentive for plug-in owners to recharge mostly overnight, when rates are lower.&lt;ref name=NYT_SFO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/will-electric-cars-cause-more-summer-power-outages/?ref=automobiles |title=Will Electric Cars Cause More Summer Power Outages? |author=Jim Motavalli |publisher=New York Times |date=2010-07-08 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

[[General Motors]] is sponsoring the Pecan Street demonstration project in [[Austin, Texas]]. The project objective is to learn the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, which is what the preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and {{as of|2013|06|lc=y}}, the community has nearly 60 [[Chevrolet Volt]] owners alone. This cluster of Volts was achieved thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's $7,500 rebate incentive, which effectively halves the purchase price of the plug-hybrid electric cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=remote-control-of-electric-cars |title=Will You or the Grid Control Your Electric Car? |author=David Biello |work=[[Scientific America]] |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks associated with noise reduction===

[[File:Nissan Leaf warning sound switch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The 2011 [[Nissan Leaf]] had a switch to manually turn off its electric warning sound system.]]

[[Electric car]]s and [[plug-in hybrid]]s when operating in [[all-electric mode]] at low speeds produce less [[roadway noise]] as compared to vehicles propelled by an [[internal combustion engine]], thereby reducing harmful [[noise health effects]]. However, blind people or the [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]]s could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-10-03-2698183585_x.htm |title=Blind people: Hybrid cars pose hazard |publisher=[[USA Today]] |first=Ben |last=Nuckols |date=3 March 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist0509"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13606446 |title=Electric cars and noise: The sound of silence |publisher=Economist |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several tests conducted in the U.S. have shown that this is a valid concern, as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below {{convert|20|mph|-1|abbr=on}} for all types of road users and not only the visually impaired.&lt;ref name=NHTSA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811204.PDF |title=Incidence of Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crashes by Hybrid Electric Passenger Vehicles |publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-05}} Technical Report DOT HS 811 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCRNews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.ucr.edu/news_item.html?action=page&amp;id=1803 |title=Hybrid Cars Are Harder to Hear |publisher=[[University of California, Riverside]] |date=2008-04-28 |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SciAm0808&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=are-hybrid-cars-too-quiet |title=Are Hybrid Cars Too Quiet to Be Safe for Pedestrians? |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date=August 2009 |author=Sarah Simpson |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At higher speeds the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;

Several [[plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents]] have taken place since the introduction of mass-production plug-in electric vehicles in 2008. Most of them have been [[thermal runaway]] incidents related to the [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] and have involved the [[Zotye Auto|Zotye M300 EV]], [[Chevrolet Volt]], [[Fisker Karma]], [[BYD e6]], [[Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrid]], [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]], [[Mitsubishi i-MiEV]] and [[Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV|Outlander P-HEV]]. {{As of|2013|11}}, four fires after a crash have been reported associated with the batteries of all-electric cars involving a [[BYD e6]] and three [[Tesla Model S]] cars.

=== Rare-earth metals availability and supply security ===
Common technology for plug-ins and electric cars is based on the [[lithium-ion battery]] and an [[electric motor]] which uses [[rare-earth element]]s. The demand for [[lithium]], [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s, and other specific elements (such as [[neodymium]], [[boron]] and [[cobalt]]) required for the batteries and powertrain is expected to grow significantly due to the future sales increase of plug-in electric vehicles in the mid and long term.&lt;ref name=PEVs6/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT030910/&gt; {{As of|2011}}, the [[Toyota Prius]] battery contains more than {{Convert|20|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of the rare-earth element [[lanthanum]],&lt;ref name=NatGeo0611&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/rare-earth-elements/folger-text |title=Rare Earth Elements: The Secret Ingredients of Everything |author=Tim Folger |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=June 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its motor magnets use [[neodymium]] and [[dysprosium]].&lt;ref name=Bloom0111/&gt; While only {{Convert|7|g|abbr=on|order=flip}} of [[Lithium carbonate|lithium carbonate equivalent]] (LCE) are required in a [[smartphone]] and {{Convert|30|g|abbr=on|order=flip}} in a [[tablet computer]], [[electric vehicle]]s and stationary [[Grid energy storage#Batteries|energy storage system]]s for homes, businesses or industry use much more lithium in their batteries. {{As of|2016}} a [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric]] passenger car might use {{Convert|5|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} of LCE, while one of [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]]'s high performance [[electric car]]s could use as much as {{Convert|80|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Markets/Commodities/Electric-vehicles-storage-units-drive-prices-up?page=2 |title=Electric vehicles, storage units drive prices up |first=Geoff |last=Hiscock |work=[[The Nikkei]] |date=2015-11-18 |accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2011 study conducted at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and the [[University of California Berkeley]], the currently estimated reserve base of lithium should not be a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles, as the study estimated that on the order of 1 billion 40 [[kWh]] Li-based batteries (about 10&amp;nbsp;kg of lithium per car)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anl.gov/energy-systems/publication/lithium-ion-batteries-examining-material-demand-and-recycling-issues |title=Lithium-Ion Batteries: Examining Material Demand and Recycling Issues |author=Gaines, LL.

The study estimated global lithium reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/08/lithium-20110803.html |title=University of Michigan and Ford researchers see plentiful lithium resources for electric vehicles |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2011-08-03 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study by [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg New Energy Finance]] (BNEF) found that availability of lithium and other finite materials used in the battery packs will not be a limiting factor for the adoption of electric vehicles. BNEF estimated that battery packs will require less than 1% of the known reserves of lithium, nickel, manganese, and copper through 2030, and 4% of the world’s cobalt. After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making packs lighter, smaller, and cheaper.&lt;ref name=BNEF2015&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/ |title=Here’s How Electric Cars Will Cause the Next Oil Crisis |first=Tom |last=Randall |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=2016-02-25 |accessdate=2016-02-25}} ''[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-02-24/the-peak-oil-myth-and-the-rise-of-the-electric-car See embedded video].''&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rare-earth elements
China has 48% of the world's reserves of rare-earth elements, the United States has 13%, and Russia, Australia, and Canada have significant deposits. Until the 1980s, the U.S. led the world in rare-earth production, but since the mid-1990s China has controlled the world market for these elements. The mines in [[Bayan Obo]] near [[Baotou]], [[Inner Mongolia]], are currently the largest source of rare-earth metals and are 80% of China's production. In 2010 China accounted for 97% of the global production of 17 rare-earth elements.&lt;ref name=NatGeo0611/&gt; Since 2006 the Chinese government has been imposing export quotas reducing supply at a rate of 5% to 10% a year.&lt;ref name=NYT041710/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT083109&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/business/global/01minerals.html?emc=eta1 |title=China Tightens Grip on Rare Minerals |author=Keith Bradsher |publisher=New York Times |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist093010&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17155730 |work=[[The Economist]] |title=Rare earths and China – Dirty business |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prices of several rare-earth elements increased sharply by mid-2010 as China imposed a 40% export reduction, citing environmental concerns as the reason for the export restrictions. These quotas have been interpreted as an attempt to control the supply of rare earths. However, the high prices have provided an incentive to begin or reactivate several rare-earth mining projects around the world, including the United States, Australia, [[Vietnam]], and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name=NYT083109/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist093010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/16944034?story_id=16944034&amp;CFID=147328796&amp;CFTOKEN=27323383 |title=Rare earths – Digging in |publisher=The Economist |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/sustainability/worries-grow-over-china-rare-earth-export-ban-news-495040 |title=Worries mount over China's 'rare earth' export ban |publisher=EurActiv.com |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, China temporarily blocked all exports of rare earths to Japan in the midst of a diplomatic dispute between the two countries.

In order to avoid its dependence on rare-earth minerals, [[Toyota Motor Corporation]] announced in January 2011 that it is developing an alternative motor for future hybrid and electric cars that does not need rare-earth materials. Toyota engineers in Japan and the U.S. are developing an [[induction motor]] that is lighter and more efficient than the magnet-type motor used in the Prius, which uses two rare earths in its motor magnets. Other popular hybrids and plug-in electric cars in the market that use these rare-earth elements are the [[Nissan Leaf]], the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Honda Insight]]. For its second generation [[Toyota RAV4 EV#Second generation|RAV4 EV]] due in 2012, Toyota is using an induction motor supplied by [[Tesla Motors]] that does not require rare-earth materials. The [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]] and the [[Tesla Model S]] use a similar motor.&lt;ref name=Bloom0111&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-14/toyota-readying-electric-motors-that-don-t-use-rare-earths.html |title=Toyota Readying Motors That Don't Use Rare Earths |work=Bloomberg |author=Alan Ohnsman |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Car dealers reluctance to sell ===

With the exception of [[Tesla Motors]], almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships, so they play a crucial role in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=NYT11242015&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/science/electric-car-auto-dealers.html?hpw&amp;rref=science&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=well-region&amp;region=bottom-well&amp;WT.nav=bottom-well |title=A Car Dealers Won't Sell: It's Electric |author=Matt Ritchel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-11-24 |accessdate=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCDavis2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.its.ucdavis.edu/blog-post/the-future-of-electric-vehicles-part-1-car-dealers-hold-the-key/ |title=The Future Of Electric Vehicles Part 1: Car Dealers Hold The Key |author1=Eric Cahill |author2=Dan Sperling |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[Institute of Transportation Studies]] (ITS), at the [[University of California, Davis]] |date=2014-11-03 |accessdate=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a salesperson can have a big impact on how someone feels about a prospective purchase. Sales people have ample knowledge of internal combustion cars while they do not have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of overall sales.&lt;ref name=NYT11242015/&gt; As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new technology, have the information and support they need to gain the full benefits of adopting this new technology.&lt;ref name=UCDavis2014/&gt;

[[File:DCA 06 2012 Chevy Volt 4034.JPG|thumb|Car dealerships play a crucial role in the sales of plug-in electric vehicles. Shown a dealership exhibiting first generation [[Chevrolet Volt]]s.]]

There are several reasons for the reluctance of some dealers to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer car dealers the same profits as gasoline-powered car. Plug-in electric vehicles take more time to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and sales people commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in loss of service revenue, and thus undermining the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the [[National Automobile Dealers Association]] (NADS), dealers on average make three times as much profit from service as they do from new car sales. However, a NADS spokesman said there was not sufficient data to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance.&lt;ref name=NYT11242015/&gt; According to [[the New York Times]], [[BMW]] and [[Nissan]] are among the companies whose dealers tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, but only about 10% of dealers are knowledgeable on the new technology.&lt;ref name=NYT11242015/&gt;

A study conducted at the [[Institute of Transportation Studies]] (ITS), at the [[University of California, Davis]] (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many car dealers are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level [[J.D. Power]] 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and [[Tesla Motors#Business model and US automotive dealership disputes|Tesla retail stores]]. The researchers found that buyers of plug-in electric vehicles were significantly less satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from dealers than conventional buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.&lt;ref name=UCDavis2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.its.ucdavis.edu/research/publications/publication-detail/?pub_id=2353 |title=New Car Dealers and Retail Innovation in California’s Plug-In Electric Vehicle Market |first1=Eric |last1=Cahill |first2=Jamie |last2=Davies-Shawhyde |first3=Thomas S. |last3=Turrentine |publisher=[[Institute of Transportation Studies]] (ITS), at the [[University of California, Davis]] |date=October 2014 |accessdate=2015-11-29}} ''Working Paper – UCD-ITS-WP-14-04.

In 2014 [[Consumer Reports]] published results from a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who wanted to buy a plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at [[Chevrolet]], [[Ford]], and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at [[Honda]] and [[Toyota]]. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid|Prius Plug-in]] and suggested buying a standard [[Toyota Prius|Prius hybrid]] instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/04/dealers-not-always-plugged-in-about-electric-cars-secret-shopper-study-reveals/index.htm |title=Dealers not always plugged in about electric cars, Consumer Reports’ study reveals |author=Eric Evarts |work=[[Consumer Reports]] |date=2014-04-22 |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ITS-Davis study also found that a small but influential minority of dealers have introduced new approaches to better meet the needs of plug-in customers. Examples include marketing [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|carpool lane]] stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do much more to support dealers selling PEVs.&lt;ref name=UCDavis2014/&gt;

Several national and local governments around the world have established tax credits, grants and other financial and non-financial incentives for consumers to purchase a plug-in electric vehicle as a policy to promote the introduction and mass market adoption of this type of vehicles.

{{As of|2010}}, 17 of the 27 [[European Union member states]] provide tax incentives for electrically chargeable vehicles.

[[File:EV1A014 (1) cropped.jpg|thumb|The [[General Motors EV1]] was the first mass-produced and purpose-designed [[all-electric car]] of the modern era from a major automaker.]]

During the 1990s several highway-capable plug-in electric cars were produced in limited quantities, all were [[battery electric vehicle]]s. [[PSA Peugeot Citroën Group|PSA Peugeot Citroën]] launched several electric "Électrique" versions of its models starting in 1991, notably the [[Citroën C15]], [[Citroën C25|C25]] and [[Citroën Berlingo électrique|Berlingo]] and [[Peugeot J5]] and [[Citroën Berlingo électrique|Partner]] panel vans and the [[Citroën AX]] and [[Citroën Saxo|Saxo]] and [[Peugeot 106]] superminis. Other models were available through leasing mainly in [[California]]. Popular models included the [[General Motors EV1]] and the [[Toyota RAV4 EV]]. Some of the latter were sold to the public and were still in use by the early 2010s.&lt;ref name="Boschert06"&gt;{{Cite book |last=[[Sherry Boschert]] |title=Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America |year=2006 |pages= |publisher=New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada |isbn=978-0-86571-571-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 2000s began a new wave of [[mass production]] plug-in electric cars, motorcycles and light trucks.

({{As of|2016|12}}, only the world's top 10 PEV selling markets meet this criteria. Please add sections only countries with PEV sales above this limit to keep the article size reasonable. The section about Europe is longer than the other because this is the only article that presents detailed information about this region.

The countries are listed in descending order of PEV sales as of December 2016. China surpassed the U.S. so now is presented first). The article [[Electric car use by country]] includes all countries with registered PEVs. Please go to that article to add information about countries not listed here, or to provide more details about the countries listed here.

'''Potassium titanyl phosphate''' ('''KTP''') is an [[inorganic compound]] with the formula KTiOPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a white solid.  KTP is an important [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] material that is commonly used for [[second harmonic generation|frequency doubling]] [[DPSS laser|diode pumped solid-state lasers]] such as [[Nd-YAG laser|Nd:YAG]] and other [[neodymium]]-doped [[laser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Potassium Titanyl Phosphate: Properties and New Applications|authors=Bierlein, John D.; Vanherzeele, Herman|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America B: Optical Physics|year=1989|volume=6|pages=622–33|doi=10.1364/JOSAB.6.000622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis and structure==
The compound is prepared by the reaction of [[titanium dioxide]] with a mixture of KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; near 1300 K. The potassium salts serve both as reagents and flux.&lt;ref name=Xray/&gt;

The material has been characterized by [[X-ray crystallography]]. KTP has an [[orthorhombic]] [[crystal structure]]. It features octahedral Ti(IV) and tetrahedral phosphate sites.  Potassium has a high coordination number.  All heavy atoms (Ti, P, K) are linked exclusively by oxides, which interconnect these atoms.&lt;ref name=Xray&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Norberg, S.T.; Ishizawa, N.|title=K-Site Splitting in KTiOPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at Room Temperature|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section C|year=2005|volume=61|pages=99–102|doi=10.1107/S0108270105027010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational aspects==
Crystals of KTP are highly transparent for wavelengths between 350–2700&amp;nbsp;nm with a reduced transmission out to 4500&amp;nbsp;nm where the crystal is effectively opaque. Its [[second harmonic generation]] (SHG) coefficient is about three times higher than [[potassium dihydrogen phosphate|KDP]]. It has a [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] of about 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Crystal Growth Technology | first = Hans J. | last = Scheel |author2=Fukuda, Tsuguo | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 2004 | isbn =  978-0-471-49524-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjDelQ4HyE4C&amp;pg=PA451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KTP is also used as an [[optical parametric oscillator]] for [[infrared|near IR]] generation up to 4&amp;nbsp;µm. It is particularly suited to high power operation as an optical parametric oscillator due to its high damage threshold and large crystal aperture. The high degree of [[birefringence|birefringent]] walk-off between the pump signal and idler beams present in this material limit its use as an optical parametric oscillator for very low power applications.

The material has a relatively high threshold to optical damage (~15 J/cm²), a excellent optical nonlinearity and excellent thermal stability in theory. In practice, KTP crystals need to have stable temperature to operate if they are pumped with 1064&amp;nbsp;nm ([[infrared]], to output 532&amp;nbsp;nm green). However, it is prone to [[photochromic]] damage (called grey tracking) during high-power 1064&amp;nbsp;nm second-harmonic generation which tends to limit its use to low- and mid-power systems.

Other such materials include potassium titanyl arsenate (KTiOAsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Some applications==
It is used to produce "greenlight" to perform some [[Prostatectomy#Laser prostate surgery|laser prostate surgery]]. KTP crystals coupled with [[Nd:YAG laser|Nd:YAG]] or [[neodymium-doped yttrium orthovanadate|Nd:YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] crystals are commonly found in green [[laser pointer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Compact Blue-green Lasers| first =Arto V. | last = Nurmikko |author2=Gosnell, Timothy R.| publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-521-52103-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dDFklOqHEG4C&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KTP is also used as an [[electro-optic modulator]], optical [[waveguide]] material, and in [[directional coupler]]s.

==Periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP)==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
'''Periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate''' ('''PPKTP''') consists of KTP with switched domain regions within the crystal for various [[nonlinear optic]] applications and frequency conversion. It can be wavelength tailored for efficient [[second harmonic generation]], [[sum frequency generation]], and difference frequency generation.  The interactions in PPKTP are based upon [[quasi-phase-matching]], achieved by [[periodic poling]] of the crystal, whereby a structure of regularly spaced [[ferroelectric]] [[Magnetic domain|domain]]s with alternating orientations are created in the material.

PPKTP is commonly used for Type 1 &amp; 2 frequency conversions for pump wavelengths of 730-3500&amp;nbsp;nm.

Other materials used for periodic poling are [[band gap|wide band gap]] inorganic crystals like [[lithium niobate]] (resulting in periodically poled lithium niobate, PPLN), [[lithium tantalate]], and some organic materials.

* [[Beta barium borate]] (BBO), used for high output power DPSS [[blue laser]]s

'''''Reinventing Fire: Bold Business Solutions for the New Energy Era''''' is a 2011 book, by [[Amory B. Lovins]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], that explores converting the United States to almost total reliance on [[renewable energy]] sources, such as [[solar energy]] and [[wind power]]. Lovins says that renewable energy is already cheaper than [[fossil fuels]] and his analysis predicts further reductions in renewable energy prices.&lt;ref name=nytrf/&gt;

''Reinventing Fire'' was launched at the Washington [[National Geographic Society]], in October 2011. [[Bill Clinton]] says the book is a “wise, detailed and comprehensive blueprint.” The book has forewords by [[Marvin Odum]], from [[Shell Oil]], and [[John Rowe (CEO) Exelon|John W. Rowe]], CEO of [[Exelon]].&lt;ref name=nytrf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/fossil-fuels-as-the-whale-oil-of-the-future/ |title=Fossil Fuels as the Whale Oil of the Future |author=Matthew Wald |date=October 27, 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first paragraph of the preface says: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Imagine fuel without fear. No climate change. No oil spills, dead coal miners, dirty air, devastated lands, lost wildlife. No energy poverty. No oil-fed wars, tyrannies, or terrorists. Nothing to run out. Nothing to cut off. Nothing to worry about. Just energy abundance, benign and affordable, for all, for ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/reinventing-transforming-capitalism-barriers?newsfeed=true |title=Nine barriers to reinventing capitalism |author=John Elkington |date=21 March 2012 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fen Montaigne in ''[[The Guardian]]'' has said that the book is impressive in both its scope and detail:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lovins discusses everything from how to redesign heavy trucks to make them more fuel efficient to ways to change factory pipes to conserve energy — the book lays out a plan for the U.S. to achieve the following by 2050: cars completely powered by [[hydrogen fuel cells]], electricity, and biofuels; 84 percent of trucks and airplanes running on biomass fuels; 80 percent of the nation's electricity produced by renewable power; $5 trillion in savings; and an economy that has grown by 158 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/21/fossil-fuels-whale-oil |title='Fossil fuels are the new whale oil', says environmentalist Amory Lovins |author=Fen Montaigne |date=21 February 2012  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By combining reduced energy use with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] gains, Lovins says that there will be a $5 trillion saving over the next 40 years and a faster-growing economy. This can all be done, the book jacket says, without "new federal taxes, subsidies, mandates, or laws. The policy innovations needed to unlock and speed it need no act of Congress."  The profitable commercialization of existing energy-saving technologies, through market forces, can be led by business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2012/03/16/amory-lovins-reinventing-fire-convergence-and-innovation?page=full |title=Amory Lovins on 'Reinventing Fire' with convergence and innovation |author=Adam Aston |date=March 16, 2012  |work=Greenbiz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox sulfur}}
'''Sulfur''' or '''sulphur''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''S''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;16. It is [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]], [[Valence (chemistry)|multivalent]], and [[nonmetal]]lic. Under [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal conditions]], sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with a chemical formula [[Octasulfur|S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow [[crystal]]line solid at room temperature. Chemically, sulfur reacts with all elements except for [[gold]], [[platinum]], [[iridium]], [[tellurium]], and the [[noble gas]]es.

Sulfur is the tenth most common element by mass in the universe, and the fifth most common on Earth. Though sometimes found in pure, [[Native element minerals|native]] form, sulfur on Earth usually occurs as [[Sulfide minerals|sulfide]] and [[sulfate minerals]]. Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, being mentioned for its uses in [[ancient India]], [[ancient Greece]], [[History of China#Ancient China|China]], and [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. In the [[Bible]], sulfur is called '''brimstone'''.&lt;ref name=Greenwd/&gt; Today, almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]]. The greatest commercial use of the element is the production of [[sulfuric acid]] for sulfate and phosphate [[fertilizer]]s, and other chemical processes. The element sulfur is used in [[match]]es, [[insecticide]]s, and [[fungicide]]s. Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous, and the smells of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, grapefruit, and garlic are due to [[organosulfur]] compounds. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] gives the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other biological processes.

Sulfur is an [[Mineral (nutrient)|essential element]] for all life, but almost always in the form of [[Organosulfur compounds|organosulfur]] compounds or metal sulfides. Three [[amino acid]]s ([[cysteine]], [[cystine]], and [[methionine]]) and two vitamins ([[biotin]] and [[thiamine]]) are organosulfur compounds. Many [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] also contain sulfur including [[glutathione]] and [[thioredoxin]] and [[iron–sulfur protein]]s. [[Disulfide]]s, S–S bonds, confer mechanical strength and insolubility of the protein [[keratin]], found in outer skin, hair, and feathers. Sulfur is one of the core chemical elements needed for [[biochemical]] functioning and is an elemental [[macronutrient]] for all living organisms.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Burning-sulfur.png|thumb|left|When burned, sulfur melts to a blood-red liquid and emits a blue flame that is best observed in the dark.]]

===Physical properties===
Sulfur forms polyatomic molecules with different chemical formulas, the best-known allotrope being [[octasulfur]], cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[point group]] of cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is D&lt;sub&gt;4d&lt;/sub&gt; and its dipole moment is 0 D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rettig|first1=S. J.|last2=Trotter|first2=J.|title=Refinement of the structure of orthorhombic sulfur, α-S8|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section C|date=15 December 1987|volume=43|issue=12|pages=2260–2262|doi=10.1107/S0108270187088152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Octasulfur is a soft, bright-yellow solid that is odorless, but impure samples have an odor similar to that of [[match]]es.&lt;ref&gt;A strong odor called "smell of sulfur" actually is given off by several sulfur compounds, such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[organosulfur]] compounds.&lt;/ref&gt; It melts at {{convert|115.21|C}}, boils at {{convert|444.6|C}} and sublimes easily.&lt;ref name=Greenwd/&gt; At {{convert|95.2|C}}, below its melting temperature, cyclo-octasulfur changes from α-octasulfur to the β-[[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]].&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw|pages = 645–665}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of the S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ring is virtually unchanged by this phase change, which affects the intermolecular interactions. Between its melting and boiling temperatures, octasulfur changes its allotrope again, turning from β-octasulfur to γ-sulfur, again accompanied by a lower density but increased [[viscosity]] due to the formation of [[polymer]]s.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt; At higher temperatures, the viscosity decreases as depolymerization occurs. Molten sulfur assumes a dark red color above {{convert|200|C}}. The density of sulfur is about 2&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, depending on the allotrope; all of the stable allotropes are excellent electrical insulators.

===Chemical properties===
Sulfur burns with a blue flame with formation of [[sulfur dioxide]], which has a suffocating and irritating odor. Sulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in [[carbon disulfide]] and, to a lesser extent, in other nonpolar organic solvents, such as [[benzene]] and [[toluene]]. The first and second ionization energies of sulfur are 999.6 and 2252&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, respectively. Despite such figures, the +2 oxidation state is rare, with +4 and +6 being more common.

[[Amorphous]] or "plastic" sulfur is produced by rapid cooling of molten sulfur—for example, by pouring it into cold water. [[X-ray crystallography]] studies show that the amorphous form may have a [[helix|helical]] structure with eight atoms per turn. The long coiled polymeric molecules make the brownish substance [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], and in bulk this form has the feel of crude rubber. This form is [[Metastability in molecules|metastable]] at room temperature and gradually reverts to crystalline molecular allotrope, which is no longer elastic. This process happens within a matter of hours to days, but can be rapidly catalyzed.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of sulfur}}
Sulfur has 25 known [[isotope]]s, four of which are stable: &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S ({{val|94.99|0.26|u=%}}), &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;S ({{val|0.75|0.02|u=%}}), &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S ({{val|4.25|0.24|u=%}}), and &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;S ({{val|0.01|0.01|u=%}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciaaw.org/sulfur.htm Sulfur]. [[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b92&gt;{{RubberBible92nd|page=1.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S, with a [[half-life]] of 87 days and formed in [[cosmic ray spallation]] of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;[[Argon|Ar]], the [[radioactivity|radioactive]] isotopes of sulfur have half-lives less than 3&amp;nbsp;hours.

When [[sulfide mineral]]s are precipitated, isotopic equilibration among solids and liquid may cause small differences in the δS-34 values of co-genetic minerals. The differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration. The δ[[carbon|C]]-13 and δS-34 of coexisting [[carbonate minerals]] and sulfides can be used to determine the [[pH]] and oxygen [[fugacity]] of the ore-bearing fluid during ore formation.

In most [[forest]] ecosystems, sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere; weathering of ore minerals and evaporites contribute some sulfur. Sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources, and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in [[hydrology|hydrologic]] studies. Differences in the [[natural abundance]]s can be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S of ecosystem components. [[Rocky Mountain]] lakes thought to be dominated by atmospheric sources of sulfate have been found to have different [[Δ34S|δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S]] values from lakes believed to be dominated by watershed sources of sulfate.

Sulfur, usually as sulfide, is present in many types of [[meteorite]]s. Ordinary chondrites contain on average 2.1% sulfur, and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as 6.6%. It is normally present as [[troilite]] (FeS), but there are exceptions, with carbonaceous chondrites containing free sulfur, sulfates and other sulfur compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=B.|last = Mason|title=Meteorites |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=1962|page=160 |isbn=978-0-908678-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive colors of [[Jupiter]]'s [[volcano|volcanic]] moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] are attributed to various forms of molten, solid and gaseous sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Lopes|first1 = Rosaly M.

[[File:Fumarola Vulcano.jpg|thumb|left|Sulfur occurs in [[fumaroles]] such as this one in [[Vulcano]], Italy]]

It is the fifth most common element by mass in the Earth. Elemental sulfur can be found near [[hot spring]]s and [[volcanic]] regions in many parts of the world, especially along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]; such volcanic deposits are currently mined in Indonesia, Chile, and Japan. These deposits are polycrystalline, with the largest documented single crystal measuring 22×16×11&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| date= 1981| title= The largest crystals| last = Rickwood|first = P. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[Sicily]] was a major source of sulfur in the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kutney|first=Gerald|title=Sulfur: history, technology, applications &amp; industry|date=2007|publisher=ChemTec Publications|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-895198-37-9|oclc=79256100|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native sulfur is synthesised by [[anaerobic bacteria]] acting on [[sulfate minerals]] such as [[gypsum]] in [[salt domes]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Cornelis and Cornelius S. Hurlbut, Jr., ''Manual of Mineralogy,'' Wiley, 1985, 20th ed., p. 265-6 {{ISBN|0-471-80580-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-3826.html Sulphur on Mindat.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Significant deposits in salt domes occur along the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and in [[evaporite]]s in eastern Europe and western Asia. Native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone. Fossil-based sulfur deposits from salt domes were until recently the basis for commercial production in the United States, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.&lt;ref name=Nehb/&gt; Currently, commercial production is still carried out in the Osiek mine in Poland. Such sources are now of secondary commercial importance, and most are no longer worked.

Common naturally occurring sulfur compounds include the [[Mineral#Sulfide class|sulfide minerals]], such as [[pyrite]] (iron sulfide), [[cinnabar]] (mercury sulfide), [[galena]] (lead sulfide), [[sphalerite]] (zinc sulfide) and [[stibnite]] (antimony sulfide); and the sulfates, such as [[gypsum]] (calcium sulfate), [[alunite]] (potassium aluminium sulfate), and [[barite]] (barium sulfate). On Earth, just as upon Jupiter's moon Io, elemental sulfur occurs naturally in volcanic emissions, including emissions from [[hydrothermal vent]]s.

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Sulfur compounds}}

Common [[oxidation state]]s of sulfur range from −2 to +6. Sulfur forms stable compounds with all elements except the [[noble gas]]es.

===Sulfur polycations===
Sulfur [[polycation]]s, S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are produced when sulfur is reacted with mild oxidising agents in a strongly acidic solution.&lt;ref&gt;Shriver, Atkins. Inorganic Chemistry, Fifth Edition. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, 2010; pp 416&lt;/ref&gt; The colored solutions produced by dissolving sulfur in [[oleum]] were first reported as early as 1804 by C.F. Bucholz, but the cause of the color and the structure of the polycations involved was only determined in the late 1960s. S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is deep blue, S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is yellow and S&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is red.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt;

===Sulfides===
Treatment of sulfur with hydrogen gives [[hydrogen sulfide]]. When dissolved in water, hydrogen sulfide is mildly acidic:&lt;ref name=Greenwd&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd ed.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S {{eqm}} HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Hydrogen sulfide gas and the hydrosulfide anion are extremely toxic to mammals, due to their inhibition of the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and certain [[cytochrome]]s in a manner analogous to [[cyanide]] and [[azide]] (see below, under ''precautions'').

Reduction of elemental sulfur gives [[polysulfide]]s, which consist of chains of sulfur atoms terminated with S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; centers:
:2 Na + S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
This reaction highlights a distinctive property of sulfur: its ability to [[Catenation|catenate]] (bind to itself by formation of chains). [[Protonation]] of these polysulfide anions produces the [[polysulfane]]s, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; where x = 2, 3, and 4.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. Vol. 1. p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, reduction of sulfur produces sulfide salts:
:16 Na + S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; → 8 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S
The interconversion of these species is exploited in the [[sodium-sulfur battery]].

The [[Trisulfur|radical anion]] S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; gives the blue color of the mineral [[lapis lazuli]].
[[File:Lapis lazuli block.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lapis lazuli]] owes its blue color to a [[trisulfur]] radical anion ({{chem|S|3|-}})]]
[[File:S@CNT.jpg|thumb|Two parallel sulfur chains grown inside a single-wall [[carbon nanotube]] (CNT, a). Zig-zag (b) and straight (c) S chains inside double-wall CNTs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ncomms3162|pmid=23851903|pmc=3717502|title=Conducting linear chains of sulphur inside carbon nanotubes|journal=Nature Communications|volume=4|pages=2162|year=2013|last1=Fujimori|first1=Toshihiko|last2=Morelos-Gómez|first2=Aarón|last3=Zhu|first3=Zhen|last4=Muramatsu|first4=Hiroyuki|last5=Futamura|first5=Ryusuke|last6=Urita|first6=Koki|last7=Terrones|first7=Mauricio|last8=Hayashi|first8=Takuya|last9=Endo|first9=Morinobu|last10=Young Hong|first10=Sang|last11=Chul Choi|first11=Young|last12=Tománek|first12=David|last13=Kaneko|first13=Katsumi|bibcode=2013NatCo...4E2162F}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Oxides, oxoacids and oxoanions===
The principal sulfur oxides are obtained by burning sulfur:
:S + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[sulfur dioxide]])
:2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[sulfur trioxide]])
Multiple sulfur oxides are known; the [[lower sulfur oxides|sulfur-rich oxides]] include sulfur monoxide, disulfur monoxide, disulfur dioxides, and [[higher sulfur oxides|higher oxides]] containing peroxo groups.

Sulfur forms [[oxoacids|sulfur oxoacids]], some of which cannot be isolated and are only known through the salts. [[Sulfur dioxide]] and [[sulfite]]s ({{chem|SO|3|2−}}) are related to the unstable [[sulfurous acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Sulfur trioxide]] and [[sulfate]]s ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}) are related to [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Sulfuric acid and SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; combine to give oleum, a solution of [[pyrosulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) in sulfuric acid.
&lt;!--[[Peroxymonosulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[peroxydisulfuric acid]]s (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), made from the action of SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] on concentrated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.--&gt;

[[Thiosulfate]] salts ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2−}}), sometimes referred as "hyposulfites", used in [[Photographic fixer|photographic fixing]] (hypo) and as reducing agents, feature sulfur in two oxidation states. [[Sodium dithionite]] ({{chem|Na|2|S|2|O|4}}), contains the more highly reducing [[dithionite]] anion ({{chem|S|2|O|4|2−}}). &lt;!--[[Sodium dithionate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) contains the [[dithionate]] anion (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) and is the first member of the [[polythionic acid]]s (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''n'' can range from 3 to many. Thiosulfurous acid (HS-S(=O)-OH) is formed in trace amounts when hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide gases are mixed at room temperature, but its salts (thiosulfites) are unknown.--&gt;

===Halides and oxyhalides===
Several sulfur halides are important to modern industry. [[Sulfur hexafluoride]] is a dense gas used as an [[dielectric gas|insulator gas]] in high voltage [[transformer]]s; it is also a nonreactive and nontoxic propellant for pressurized containers. [[Sulfur tetrafluoride]] is a rarely used organic reagent that is highly toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|last=Hasek|first=W. R.|title=1,1,1-Trifluoroheptane|volume=41|page=104|year=1961|doi=10.1002/0471264180.os041.28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sulfur dichloride]] and [[disulfur dichloride]] are important industrial chemicals. [[Sulfuryl chloride]] and [[chlorosulfuric acid]] are derivatives of sulfuric acid; [[thionyl chloride]] (SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a common reagent in [[organic synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|last1=Rutenberg|first1=M.

===Pnictides===
An important S–N compound is the cage [[tetrasulfur tetranitride]] (S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Heating this compound gives [[Polythiazyl|polymeric sulfur nitride]] ((SN)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), which has metallic properties even though it does not contain any [[metal]] atoms. [[Thiocyanate]]s contain the SCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; group. Oxidation of thiocyanate gives [[thiocyanogen]], (SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the connectivity NCS-SCN. [[Phosphorus sulfide]]s are numerous, the most important commercially being the cages P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heal |first=H.

===Metal sulfides===
{{Main|Sulfide mineral}}
The principal ores of copper, zinc, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, and other metals are sulfides. These materials tend to be dark-colored [[semiconductor]]s that are not readily attacked by water or even many acids. They are formed, both [[Geochemical cycle|geochemically]] and in the laboratory, by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with metal salts. The mineral [[galena]] (PbS) was the first demonstrated semiconductor and was used as a signal [[rectifier]] in the [[Cat's-whisker detector|cat's whiskers]] of early [[crystal radio]]s. The iron sulfide called [[pyrite]], the so-called "fool's gold", has the formula FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, D. J.; Craig, J. R. "Mineral Chemistry of Metal Sulfides" Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (1978) {{ISBN|0-521-21489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processing these ores, usually by [[smelting|roasting]], is costly and environmentally hazardous. Sulfur corrodes many metals through [[tarnishing]].

Some of the main classes of sulfur-containing organic compounds include the following:&lt;ref name=Cremlyn&gt;Cremlyn R. J.; "An Introduction to Organosulfur Chemistry" John Wiley and Sons: Chichester (1996). {{ISBN|0-471-95512-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thiol]]s or mercaptans (so called because they capture mercury as [[Chelation|chelators]]) are the sulfur analogs of [[alcohol]]s; treatment of thiols with base gives [[thiolate]] ions.
* [[Thioether]]s are the sulfur analogs of [[ether]]s.
* [[Sulfonium]] ions have three groups attached to a cationic sulfur center. [[Dimethylsulfoniopropionate]] (DMSP) is one such compound, important in the marine organic [[sulfur cycle]].
* [[Sulfoxide]]s and [[sulfone]]s are thioethers with one and two oxygen atoms attached to the sulfur atom, respectively. The simplest sulfoxide, [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], is a common solvent; a common sulfone is [[sulfolane]].
* [[Sulfonic acid]]s are used in many detergents.

Compounds with carbon-sulfur multiple bonds are uncommon, an exception being [[carbon disulfide]], a volatile colorless liquid that is structurally similar to carbon dioxide. It is used as a reagent to make the polymer [[rayon]] and many organosulfur compounds. Unlike [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon monosulfide]] is stable only as an extremely dilute gas, found between solar systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=R. W.|last2=Penzias|first2=A.

Organosulfur compounds are responsible for some of the unpleasant odors of decaying organic matter. They are widely known as the [[Odorizer|odorant]] in domestic natural gas, garlic odor, and skunk spray. Not all organic sulfur compounds smell unpleasant at all concentrations: the sulfur-containing [[terpene|monoterpenoid]] ([[grapefruit mercaptan]]) in small concentrations is the characteristic scent of grapefruit, but has a generic thiol odor at larger concentrations. [[Sulfur mustard]], a potent [[blister agent|vesicant]], was [[Chemical weapons in World War I|used in World War I]] as a disabling agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Banoub|first=Joseph|title=Detection of Biological Agents for the Prevention of Bioterrorism|journal=Detection of Biological Agents for the Prevention of Bioterrorism|date=2011|isbn=978-90-481-9815-3|oclc=697506461|page=183|bibcode=2011dbap.book.....B|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-9815-3|series=NATO Science for Peace and Security Series A: Chemistry and Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur-sulfur bonds are a structural component used to stiffen rubber, similar to the disulfide bridges that rigidify proteins (see biological below). In the most common type of industrial "curing" or hardening and strengthening of natural [[rubber]], elemental sulfur is heated with the rubber to the point that chemical reactions form [[disulfide]] bridges between [[isoprene]] units of the polymer. This process, patented in 1843, made rubber a major industrial product, especially in automobile tires. Because of the heat and sulfur, the process was named [[sulfur vulcanization|vulcanization]], after the Roman god of the forge and [[volcanism]].

==History==

===Antiquity===

[[File:MODOAzufre.jpg|thumb|Pharmaceutical container for sulfur from the first half of the 20th century. From the [[Museo del Objeto del Objeto]] collection]]

Being abundantly available in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times and is referred to in the [[Torah]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]). [[English translations of the Bible]] commonly referred to burning sulfur as "brimstone", giving rise to the term "[[fire and brimstone|fire-and-brimstone]]" [[sermon]]s, in which listeners are reminded of the fate of [[Damnation|eternal damnation]] that await the unbelieving and unrepentant. It is from this part of the Bible that [[Hell]] is implied to "smell of sulfur" (likely due to its association with volcanic activity). According to the [[Ebers Papyrus]], a sulfur ointment was used in ancient [[Egypt]] to treat granular eyelids. Sulfur was used for fumigation in preclassical [[Greece]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ed0yC98aAKYC&amp;pg=PA242 | title = Archaeomineralogy | isbn = 978-3-540-78593-4 | page = 242 | author1 = Rapp | first1 = George Robert | date = 4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+22.480 ''Odyssey'', book 22, lines 480–495]. www.perseus.tufts.edu.

===Modern times===
[[File:Soufre extraction 1.jpg|thumb|Sicilian kiln used to obtain sulfur from volcanic rock]]
In 1777, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was an element, not a compound.

Sulfur deposits in [[Sicily]] were the dominant source for more than a century. By the late 18th century, about 2,000 tonnes per year of sulfur were imported into [[Marseilles]], France, for the production of [[sulfuric acid]] for use in the [[Leblanc process]]. In [[Industrial Revolution|industrializing]] Britain, with the repeal of [[tariff]]s on salt in 1824, demand for sulfur from Sicily surged upward. The increasing British control and exploitation of the mining, refining, and transportation of the sulfur, coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform Sicily's backward and impoverished economy, led to the 'Sulfur Crisis' of 1840, when [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand II]] gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a French firm, violating an earlier 1816 trade agreement with Britain. A peaceful solution was eventually negotiated by France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wZg4ecXXmNYC|title=Sicily and the Unification of Italy: Liberal Policy and Local Power, 1859–1866|author=Riall, Lucy|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 February 2013|isbn=9780191542619}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prelude to the Sulphur War of 1840: The Neapolitan Perspective|journal=European History Quarterly|date=April 1995|volume=25|pages=163–180|doi=10.1177/026569149502500201|last1=Thomson|first1=D. W.|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, elemental sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]]. The highly successful [[Frasch process]] was developed to extract this resource.&lt;ref name="Frasch"&gt;{{cite journal|first = Walter|last = Botsch|title = Chemiker, Techniker, Unternehmer: Zum 150.

In the late 18th century, [[furniture]] makers used molten sulfur to produce [[sulfur inlay|decorative inlays]] in their craft. Because of the [[sulfur dioxide]] produced during the process of melting sulfur, the craft of sulfur inlays was soon abandoned. Molten sulfur is sometimes still used for setting steel bolts into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floor-mounted equipment attachment points. Pure powdered sulfur was used as a medicinal tonic and laxative.&lt;ref name=Nehb/&gt; With the advent of the [[contact process]], the majority of sulfur today is used to make [[sulfuric acid]] for a wide range of uses, particularly fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kogel|first=Jessica|title=Industrial minerals &amp; rocks: commodities, markets, and uses|date=2006|publisher=Littleton|location=Colorado|isbn=978-0-87335-233-8|edition=7th|page=935|oclc=62805047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spelling and etymology===
''Sulfur'' is derived from the Latin word ''{{lang|la|sulpur}}'', which was [[Hellenized]] to ''{{lang|la|sulphur}}''. The spelling ''{{lang|la|sulfur}}'' appears toward the end of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]]. (The true Greek word for sulfur, {{lang|grc|θεῖον}}, is the source of the international chemical prefix ''[[thio-]]''.) In 12th-century [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]], it was ''{{lang|xno|sulfre}}''; in the 14th century the Latin ''{{lang|la|-ph-}}'' was restored, for ''{{lang|enm|sulphre}}''; and by the 15th century the full Latin spelling was restored, for ''sulfur, sulphur''. The parallel ''f~ph'' spellings continued in Britain until the 19th century, when the word was standardized as ''sulphur''.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{OED|sulphur}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sulfur'' was the form chosen in the United States, whereas Canada uses both. The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] adopted the spelling ''sulfur'' in 1990, as did the Nomenclature Committee of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] in 1992, restoring the spelling ''sulfur'' to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McNaught |first1=Alan |title=Journal style update |journal=The Analyst |volume=116 |issue=11 |page=1094 |date=1991 |doi=10.1039/AN9911601094 |bibcode=1991Ana...116.1094M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford Dictionaries note that "in chemistry and other technical uses ... the ''-f-'' spelling is now the standard form for this and related words in British as well as US contexts, and is increasingly used in general contexts as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sulphur |title=sulphur – definition of sulphur in English |website=Oxford Dictionaries |access-date=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Bergelut dengan asap nan beracun.jpg|thumb|Traditional sulfur mining at [[Ijen|Ijen Volcano]], East Java, Indonesia. This image shows the dangerous and rugged conditions the miners face, including toxic smoke and high drops, as well as their lack of protective equipment. The pipes over which they are standing are for condensing sulfur vapors.]]
Sulfur may be found by itself and historically was usually obtained in this form; pyrite has also been a source of sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Riegel|first1=Emil|last2=Kent|first2=James|title=Kent and Riegel's handbook of industrial chemistry and biotechnology|journal=Kent and Riegel's Handbook of Industrial Chemistry and Biotechnology|volume=1|date=2007|isbn=978-0-387-27842-1|oclc=74650396|page=1171|bibcode=2007karh.book......}}&lt;/ref&gt; In volcanic regions in [[Sicily]], in ancient times, it was found on the surface of the Earth, and the ''"Sicilian process"'' was used: sulfur deposits were piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides, with airspaces between them. Then, some sulfur was pulverized, spread over the stacked ore and ignited, causing the free sulfur to melt down the hills. Eventually the surface-borne deposits played out, and miners excavated veins that ultimately dotted the Sicilian landscape with labyrinthine mines. Mining was unmechanized and labor-intensive, with pickmen freeing the ore from the rock, and mine-boys or ''[[carusu|carusi]]'' carrying baskets of ore to the surface, often through a mile or more of tunnels. Once the ore was at the surface, it was reduced and extracted in smelting ovens. The conditions in Sicilian sulfur mines were horrific, prompting [[Booker T. Washington]] to write "I am not prepared just now to say to what extent I believe in a physical hell in the next world, but a sulphur mine in Sicily is about the nearest thing to hell that I expect to see in this life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Washington|first=Booker T.|title=The Man Farthest Down: A Record of Observation and Study in Europe| url =https://archive.org/stream/manfarthestdownr00wash#page/214 |year=1912|publisher=Doubleday, Page.|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elemental sulfur was extracted from [[salt dome]]s (in which it sometimes occurs in nearly pure form) until the late 20th century. Sulfur is now  produced as a side product of other industrial processes such as in oil refining, in which sulfur is undesired. As a mineral, native sulfur under salt domes is thought to be a fossil mineral resource, produced by the action of ancient bacteria on sulfate deposits. It was removed from such salt-dome mines mainly by the [[Frasch process]].&lt;ref name=Nehb/&gt; In this method, superheated water was pumped into a native sulfur deposit to melt the sulfur, and then compressed air returned the 99.5% pure melted product to the surface. Throughout the 20th century this procedure produced elemental sulfur that required no further purification. Due to a limited number of such sulfur deposits and the high cost of working them, this process for mining sulfur has not been employed in a major way anywhere in the world since 2002.&lt;ref name="desulf1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Eow|first1 = John S.|title = Recovery of sulfur from sour acid gas: A review of the technology|journal = Environmental Progress|volume = 21|issue = 3|pages = 143–162|date = 2002|doi = 10.1002/ep.670210312}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="desulf2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Schreiner|first1 = Bernhard|title = Der Claus-Prozess.

[[File:AlbertaSulfurAtVancouverBC.jpg|thumb|Sulfur recovered from hydrocarbons in [[Alberta]], stockpiled for shipment in North Vancouver, British Columbia]]
Today, sulfur is produced from petroleum, [[natural gas]], and related fossil resources, from which it is obtained mainly as [[hydrogen sulfide]]. [[Organosulfur compound]]s, undesirable impurities in petroleum, may be upgraded by subjecting them to [[hydrodesulfurization]], which cleaves the C–S bonds:&lt;ref name="desulf1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desulf2"/&gt;
:R-S-R + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 RH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S
The resulting hydrogen sulfide from this process, and also as it occurs in natural gas, is converted into elemental sulfur by the [[Claus process]]. This process entails oxidation of some hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide and then the [[comproportionation]] of the two:&lt;ref name="desulf1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desulf2"/&gt;
:3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → 3 S + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
[[File:Sulfur price world production.svg|thumb|Production and price (US market) of elemental sulfur]]

The world production of sulfur in 2011 amounted to 69 million tonnes (Mt), with more than 15 countries contributing more than 1 Mt each. Countries producing more than 5 Mt are China (9.6), US (8.8), Canada (7.1) and Russia (7.1).&lt;ref&gt;Apodaca, Lori E.

==Applications==
===Sulfuric acid===
Elemental sulfur is used mainly as a precursor to other chemicals. Approximately 85% (1989) is converted to [[sulfuric acid]] ([[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;):
:2 S + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[[File:2000sulphuric acid.PNG|thumb|Sulfuric acid production in 2000]]
In 2010, the United States produced more sulfuric acid than any other inorganic industrial chemical.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|title = Mineral Yearbook 2010: Sulfur|author=Apodaca, Lori E. |publisher = United States Geological Survey|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/sulfur/myb1-2010-sulfu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal use for the acid is the extraction of phosphate ores for the production of fertilizer manufacturing. Other applications of sulfuric acid include oil refining, wastewater processing, and mineral extraction.&lt;ref name=Nehb/&gt;

===Other important sulfur chemistry===
Sulfur reacts directly with methane to give [[carbon disulfide]], used to manufacture [[cellophane]] and [[rayon]].&lt;ref name=Nehb&gt;{{cite book |last=Nehb |first=Wolfgang|last2=Vydra|first2=Karel |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |date=2006|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag|doi=10.1002/14356007.a25_507.pub2 |chapter=Sulfur |isbn=978-3-527-30673-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the uses of elemental sulfur is in [[vulcanization]] of rubber, where [[polysulfide]] chains crosslink organic polymers.&lt;!--need something on pulping--&gt; Large quantities of [[sulfite]]s are used to [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]] [[paper]] and to preserve dried [[fruit]]. Many [[surfactant]]s and [[detergents]] (e.g. [[sodium lauryl sulfate]]) are sulfate derivatives. [[Calcium sulfate]], gypsum, (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is mined on the scale of 100 million [[tonne]]s each year for use in [[Portland cement]] and fertilizers.

When silver-based [[photography]] was widespread, sodium and ammonium [[sodium thiosulfate|thiosulfate]] were widely used as "fixing agents." Sulfur is a component of [[gunpowder]] ("black powder").

===Fertilizer===
Sulfur is increasingly used as a component of [[fertilizer]]s. The most important form of sulfur for fertilizer is the mineral [[calcium sulfate]]. Elemental sulfur is [[hydrophobic]] (not soluble in water) and cannot be used directly by plants. Over time, soil bacteria can convert it to soluble derivatives, which can then be used by plants. Sulfur improves the efficiency of other essential plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sulphurinstitute.org/learnmore/faq.cfm#plants Sulfur as a fertilizer]. Sulphurinstitute.org. Retrieved on 16 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Biologically produced sulfur particles are naturally hydrophilic due to a biopolymer coating and are easier to disperse over the land in a spray of diluted slurry, resulting in a faster uptake.

The botanical requirement for sulfur equals or exceeds the requirement for phosphorus. [[Plant nutrition|It is an essential nutrient for plant]] growth, root nodule formation of legumes, and immunity and defense systems. Sulfur deficiency has become widespread in many countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1006/jcrs.1998.0241|title = Sulphur Assimilation and Effects on Yield and Quality of Wheat|date = 1999|last1 = Zhao|first1 = F.|journal = Journal of Cereal Science|volume = 30|issue = 1|pages = 1–17|last2 = Hawkesford|first2 = M.

===Fine chemicals===
[[File:Malathion-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|A molecular model of the pesticide [[malathion]]]]
Organosulfur compounds are used in [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[dyestuff]]s, and agrochemicals. Many drugs contain sulfur, early examples being antibacterial [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]], known as ''sulfa drugs''. Sulfur is a part of many bacterial defense molecules. Most [[β-lactam]] antibiotics, including the [[penicillin]]s, [[cephalosporins]] and [[monolactam]]s contain sulfur.&lt;ref name=Cremlyn/&gt;

[[Magnesium sulfate]], known as Epsom salts when in hydrated crystal form, can be used as a [[laxative]], a bath additive, an [[exfoliant]], [[magnesium]] supplement for plants, or (when in dehydrated form) as a [[desiccant]].

===Fungicide and pesticide===&lt;!--[[Wettable Sulfur]] redirs here--&gt;
[[File:Sulphur Candle.jpg|thumb|upright|Sulfur candle originally sold for home fumigation]]
Elemental sulfur is one of the oldest fungicides and pesticides. "Dusting sulfur", elemental sulfur in powdered form, is a common fungicide for grapes, strawberry, many vegetables and several other crops. It has a good efficacy against a wide range of powdery mildew diseases as well as black spot. In organic production, sulfur is the most important fungicide. It is the only fungicide used in [[Organic agriculture|organically]] farmed apple production against the main disease [[apple scab]] under colder conditions. Biosulfur (biologically produced elemental sulfur with hydrophilic characteristics) can also be used for these applications.

Standard-formulation dusting sulfur is applied to crops with a sulfur duster or from a dusting plane. Wettable sulfur is the commercial name for dusting sulfur formulated with additional ingredients to make it water [[miscibility|miscible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OYecyRmnTEkC&amp;pg=PA104|pages = 104–105 |title = Sulfur Concrete for the Construction Industry: A Sustainable Development Approach |isbn = 978-1-60427-005-1 |author1 = Mohamed, Abdel-Mohsen Onsy |author2 = El Gamal, M.

Elemental sulfur powder is used as an "[[organic farming|organic]]" (i.e., "green") [[insecticide]] (actually an [[acaricide]]) against [[tick]]s and [[mites]]. A common method of application is dusting the clothing or limbs with sulfur powder.

A diluted solution of [[lime sulfur]] (made by combining [[calcium hydroxide]] with elemental sulfur in water) is used as a dip for pets to destroy [[ringworm|ringworm (fungus)]], [[mange]], and other [[cutaneous conditions|dermatoses]] and [[parasitism|parasites]].

Sulfur candles of almost pure sulfur were burned to [[fumigant|fumigate]] structures and wine barrels, but are now considered too toxic for residences.

===Bactericide in winemaking and food preservation===
Small amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] gas addition (or equivalent [[potassium metabisulfite]] addition) to fermented wine to produce traces of [[sulfurous acid]] (produced when SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with water) and its [[sulfite]] salts in the mixture, has been called "the most powerful tool in winemaking."&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Benjamin [http://www.intowine.com/sulfur-wine-demystified Sulfur in wine demystified]. intowine.com. Retrieved 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; After the yeast-fermentation stage in [[winemaking]], sulfites absorb oxygen and inhibit [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] bacterial growth that otherwise would turn ethanol into acetic acid, souring the wine. Without this preservative step, indefinite refrigeration of the product before consumption is usually required. Similar methods go back into antiquity but modern historical mentions of the practice go to the fifteenth century. The practice is used by large industrial wine producers and small organic wine producers alike.

Sulfur dioxide and various sulfites have been used for their antioxidant antibacterial preservative properties in many other parts of the food industry. The practice has declined since reports of an allergy-like reaction of some persons to sulfites in foods.

Sulfur (specifically [[octasulfur]], S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is used in pharmaceutical skin preparations for the treatment of [[acne]] and other conditions. It acts as a [[keratolytic]] agent and also kills bacteria, fungi, [[scabies]] mites and other parasites.&lt;ref name="Hager"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hagers Handbuch der Pharmazeutischen Praxis|edition=4th|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin–Heidelberg–New York|language=German|date=1978|volume=6B|pages=672–9|isbn=978-3-540-07738-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precipitated sulfur and colloidal sulfur are used, in form of [[lotion]]s, creams, powders, soaps, and bath additives, for the treatment of [[acne vulgaris]], [[acne rosacea]], and [[seborrhoeic dermatitis]].&lt;ref name="Arzneibuch-Kommentar"&gt;{{cite book|title=Arzneibuch-Kommentar.

Common adverse effects include irritation of the skin at the application site, such as dryness, stinging, itching and peeling.&lt;ref name="MTM"&gt;{{Drugs.com|MTM|sulfur-topical}}: Sulfur topical.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mechanism of action====
{{expand section|1=the keratolysis mechanism|date=March 2014}}
Sulfur is converted to hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) through [[Redox|reduction]], partly by bacteria. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S kills bacteria (possibly including ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]'' which plays a role in acne,&lt;ref name="Drugs.com"&gt;{{Drugs.com|pro|perrigo-sodium-sulfacetamide-and-sulfur}}: Perrigo Sodium Sulfacetamide and Sulfur.&lt;/ref&gt;) fungi, and parasites such as scabies mites.&lt;ref name="Hager" /&gt;

===Furniture===
{{main|Sulfur inlay}}
Sulfur can be used to create decorative [[inlay]]s in wooden furniture. After a design has been cut into the wood, molten sulfur is poured in and then scraped away so it is flush. Sulfur inlays were particularly popular in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, notably amongst [[Pennsylvania German]] cabinetmakers. The practice soon died out, as less toxic and flammable substances were substituted. However, some modern craftsmen have occasionally revived the technique in the creation of replica pieces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2005-01/worst-way-inlay The Worst Way To Inlay], ''[[Popular Science]]'', January 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0957-0233/14/9/311|title= Pennsylvania German sulfur-inlaid furniture: characterization, reproduction, and ageing phenomena of the inlays|journal= Measurement Science and Technology|volume= 14|issue= 9|pages= 1598|year= 2003|last1= Mass|first1= Jennifer L|last2= Anderson|first2= Mark J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological role==

===Protein and organic cofactors===
Sulfur is an essential component of all living [[cell (biology)|cells]]. It is either the seventh or eighth most abundant element in the human body by weight, about equal in abundance to [[potassium]], and slightly greater than sodium and chlorine. A {{convert|70|kg|abbr=on}} human body contains about 140&amp;nbsp;grams of sulfur.

In [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, the [[amino acid]]s [[cysteine]] and [[methionine]] contain most of the sulfur, and the element is present in all [[polypeptide]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[enzyme]]s that contain these amino acids. In humans, methionine is an essential amino acid that must be ingested. However, save for the vitamins [[biotin]] and [[thiamine]], cysteine and all sulfur-containing compounds in the human body can be synthesized from methionine. The enzyme [[sulfite oxidase]] is needed for the metabolism of methionine and cysteine in humans and animals.

[[Disulfide bond]]s (S-S bonds) between cysteine residues in peptide chains are very important in protein assembly and structure. These covalent bonds between peptide chains confer extra toughness and rigidity.&lt;ref name=Lehn/&gt; For example, the high strength of feathers and hair is due in part to the high content of S-S bonds with cysteine and sulfur. Eggs are high in sulfur to nourish feather formation in chicks, and the characteristic odor of rotting eggs is due to [[hydrogen sulfide]]. The high disulfide bond content of hair and feathers contributes to their indigestibility and to their characteristic disagreeable odor when burned.

[[Homocysteine]] and [[taurine]] are other sulfur-containing acids that are similar in structure, but not coded by [[DNA]], and are not part of the [[primary structure]] of proteins. Many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with -SH moieties to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals: two common examples from basic metabolism are [[coenzyme A]] and [[alpha-lipoic acid]].&lt;ref name=Lehn&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-1-57259-153-0|last1 = Nelson|first1 = D. L.|last2 = Cox|first2 = M. M.|title = Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry|edition= 3rd |publisher = Worth Publishing|place = New York|date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the 13 classical vitamins, [[biotin]] and [[thiamine]], contain sulfur, with the latter being named for its sulfur content.

In intracellular chemistry, sulfur operates as a carrier of reducing hydrogen and its electrons for cellular repair of oxidation. Reduced [[glutathione]], a sulfur-containing tripeptide, is a reducing agent through its sulfhydryl (-SH) moiety derived from [[cysteine]]. The [[thioredoxin]]s, a class of small proteins essential to all known life, use neighboring pairs of reduced cysteines to work as general protein reducing agents, with similar effect.

[[Methanogenesis]], the route to most of the world's methane, is a multistep biochemical transformation of [[carbon dioxide]]. This conversion requires several organosulfur cofactors. These include [[coenzyme M]], CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, the immediate precursor to [[methane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Thauer|first1 = R. K.|title = Biochemistry of methanogenesis: a tribute to Marjory Stephenson:1998 Marjory Stephenson Prize Lecture|journal = Microbiology|volume = 144|issue = 9|pages = 2377–2406|date = 1998|pmid = 9782487|doi = 10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metalloproteins and inorganic cofactors===
Inorganic sulfur forms a part of [[iron–sulfur cluster]]s as well as many copper, nickel, and iron proteins. Most pervasive are the [[ferrodoxin]]s, which serve as electron shuttles in cells. In bacteria, the important [[nitrogenase]] enzymes contains an Fe–Mo–S cluster and is a [[catalyst]] that performs the important function of [[nitrogen fixation]], converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia that can be used by microorganisms and plants to make proteins, DNA, RNA, alkaloids, and the other organic nitrogen compounds necessary for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn =978-0-935702-73-6| first1 = S.

===Sulfur metabolism and the sulfur cycle===
{{Main|Sulfur metabolism|Sulfur cycle}}
The sulfur cycle was the first of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s to be discovered. In the 1880s, while studying [[Beggiatoa]] (a bacterium living in a sulfur rich environment), [[Sergei Winogradsky]] found that it oxidized [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) as an energy source, forming intracellular sulfur droplets. Winogradsky referred to this form of metabolism as inorgoxidation (oxidation of inorganic compounds). He continued to study it together with [[Selman Waksman]] until the 1950s.

Sulfur oxidizers can use as energy sources reduced sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, [[sulfite]], [[thiosulfate]], and various polythionates (e.g., [[tetrathionate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pronk JT | author2 = Meulenberg R | author3 = Hazeu W | author4 = Bos P | author5 = Kuenen JG | date = 1990 | title = Oxidation of reduced inorganic sulphur compounds by acidophilic thiobacilli | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 75 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 293–306 | url = http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:9592868a-b999-4712-a233-191b615da6c6/864579.pdf | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6968.1990.tb04103.x | access-date = 1 June 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212657/http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:9592868a-b999-4712-a233-191b615da6c6/864579.pdf | archive-date = 4 October 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They depend on enzymes such as [[sulfur dioxygenase|sulfur oxygenase]] and [[sulfite oxidase]] to oxidize sulfur to sulfate. Some [[lithotroph]]s can even use the energy contained in sulfur compounds to produce sugars, a process known as [[chemosynthesis]]. Some [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] use hydrogen sulfide in place of water as the [[electron donor]] in chemosynthesis, a process similar to [[photosynthesis]] that produces sugars and utilizes oxygen as the [[electron acceptor]]. The [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[green sulfur bacteria]] and [[purple sulfur bacteria]] and some [[lithotroph]]s use elemental oxygen to carry out such oxidization of hydrogen sulfide to produce elemental sulfur (S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), oxidation state = 0. Primitive bacteria that live around deep ocean [[hydrothermal vent|volcanic vents]] oxidize hydrogen sulfide in this way with oxygen; the [[giant tube worm]] is an example of a large organism that uses hydrogen sulfide (via bacteria) as food to be oxidized.

The so-called [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]], by contrast, "breathe sulfate" instead of oxygen. They use organic compounds or molecular hydrogen as the energy source. They use sulfur as the electron acceptor, and reduce various oxidized sulfur compounds back into sulfide, often into hydrogen sulfide. They can grow on other partially oxidized sulfur compounds (e.g. thiosulfates, thionates, polysulfides, sulfites). The hydrogen sulfide produced by these bacteria is responsible for some of the smell of intestinal gases ([[flatus]]) and decomposition products.

Sulfur is absorbed by [[plant]]s [[root]]s from soil as [[sulfate]] and transported as a phosphate ester. Sulfate is reduced to sulfide via sulfite before it is incorporated into [[cysteine]] and other organosulfur compounds.&lt;ref name="Heldt"&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-3-8274-0103-8| pages = 321–333|first = Hans-Walter|last = Heldt|title = Pflanzenbiochemie|publisher = Spektrum Akademischer Verlag|place = Heidelberg|date =1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → cysteine → methionine

[[File:Acid rain woods1.JPG|Effect of acid rain on a forest, Jizera Mountains, Czech Republic|thumb]]
Elemental sulfur is non-toxic, as are most of the soluble [[sulfate]] salts, such as [[Epsom salt]]s. Soluble sulfate salts are poorly absorbed and laxative. When injected parenterally, they are freely filtered by the kidneys and eliminated with very little toxicity in multi-gram amounts.

When sulfur burns in air, it produces [[sulfur dioxide]]. In water, this gas produces sulfurous acid and sulfites; sulfites are antioxidants that inhibit growth of aerobic bacteria and a useful [[food additive]] in small amounts. At high concentrations these acids harm the [[Human lungs|lungs]], [[Human eyes|eyes]] or other [[Biological tissue|tissues]]. In organisms without lungs such as insects or plants, sulfite in high concentration prevents [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]].

[[Sulfur trioxide]] (made by catalysis from sulfur dioxide) and [[sulfuric acid]] are similarly highly acidic and corrosive in the presence of water. Sulfuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent that can strip available water molecules and water components from sugar and organic tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Baker |first=Colin |date=1 March 2007 |title=The dehydration of sucrose |url=https://eic.rsc.org/exhibition-chemistry/the-dehydration-of-sucrose/2020073.article   |magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]] |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |access-date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burning of [[coal]] and/or [[petroleum]] by industry and [[power plants]] generates sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfurous acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). These acids are components of [[acid rain]], lowering the [[pH]] of [[soil]] and freshwater bodies, sometimes resulting in substantial damage to the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[chemical weathering]] of statues and structures. Fuel standards increasingly require that fuel producers extract sulfur from [[fossil fuel]]s to prevent acid rain formation. This extracted and refined sulfur represents a large portion of sulfur production. In coal-fired power plants, [[flue gases]] are sometimes purified. More modern power plants that use [[synthesis gas]] extract the sulfur before they burn the gas.

[[Hydrogen sulfide]] is as [[toxic]] as [[hydrogen cyanide]], and kills by the same mechanism (inhibition of the respiratory enzyme [[cytochrome oxidase]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/815139-overview#a4 Gresham et al, Medscape: Hydrogen sulfide toxicity]&lt;/ref&gt; though hydrogen sulfide is less likely to cause surprise poisonings from small inhaled amounts because of its disagreeable odor. Hydrogen sulfide quickly deadens the sense of smell and a victim may breathe increasing quantities without noticing the increase until severe symptoms cause death. Dissolved [[sulfide]] and [[hydrosulfide]] salts are toxic by the same mechanism.

A '''tonga''' or '''tanga''' ([[IAST]] ṭā̃gā, [[Hindi]]: टाँगा, [[Urdu]]: تانگا , [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: টাঙ্গা) is a light carriage or [[curricle]] drawn by ONE horse (compare [[ekka (carriage)|ekka]]) used for transportation in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]]. They have a canopy over the carriage with a single pair of large wheels. The passengers reach the seats from the rear while the driver sits in front of the carriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gilbert, William H., Jr. |year=1944|title=Peoples of India|place=Washington|publisher= Smithsonian Institution|url=https://archive.org/stream/peoplesofindia18gilb#page/16/mode/2up/|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some space is available for baggage below the carriage, between the wheels. This space is often used to carry hay for the horses.

Tangas were popular before the advent of automobiles and are still in use in some parts of South Asia. They are a popular mode of transportation because they are fun to ride in, and are usually cheaper to hire than a [[Taxicab|taxi]] or [[Auto rickshaw|rickshaw]]. However, in many cities, tangas are not allowed to use highways because of their slow pace. In [[Pakistan]], tangas are mainly found in the older parts of cities and towns, and are becoming less popular for utilitarian travel and more popular for pleasure. Tangas have become a traditional feature of [[weddings]] and other social functions in Pakistan, as well as in other nations.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In India, tangas also prevail in rural areas of North India like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab. Apart from the modern modes of transport, tangas are still standing in line at bus stops, railway stations to transport luggage and passengers to their destinations in small towns of North India. The culture of the tanga is disappearing due to the speed of modern transportation and the earnings people make. However, there are still some that continue to support themselves and keep the tradition alive. Tourists who come to India still take rides in tangas to experience their Indian charm. They are still among the most appreciated experiences of North India

The high appeal of titanium foams is directly correlated to a multi-industry demand for advancement in this technology.

== Characterization ==

Banhart &lt;ref name="r12"&gt;J. Banhart, Manufacture, characterization and application of cellular metals and metal foams, Progress in materials science 46(6) (2001) 559-632.&lt;/ref&gt; describes two dominating perspectives in which cellular metals are characterized, referring to them as atomistic and macroscopic. The atomistic (or molecular) perspective holds that a cellular material is a construction of struts, membranes, and other elements which possess mechanical properties of their bulk metal counterpart. Indeed, the physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of titanium foams are commonly measured using the same methods as that of their solid counterparts. However, special precautions must be taken due to the cellular structure of metal foams.&lt;ref name="r13"&gt;M.F. Ashby, Metal foams: a design guide, Butterworth-Heinemann2000.&lt;/ref&gt; From a macroscopic perspective, the cellular structure is perceived as a homogenous structure and characterized by considering the effective (or averaged) material parameters.&lt;ref name = "r12" /&gt;

== Mechanical properties ==

As with other metal foams, the properties of titanium foams depend mostly on the properties of the starting material and the relative density of the resultant foam.&lt;ref name = "r20"&gt;M.F. Ashby, T. Evans, N.A. Fleck, J. Hutchinson, H. Wadley, L. Gibson, Metal Foams: A Design Guide: A Design Guide, Elsevier2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thermal properties in foams – such as melting point, specific heat and expansion coefficient – remain constant for both the foams and the metals from which they are composed. However, the mechanical properties of foams are greatly influenced by [[microstructure]], which include the aforementioned properties as well as anisotropy and defects within the foam's structure.&lt;ref name = "r21"&gt;P. Kelly, D. Nowell, Three-dimensional cracks with Dugdale-type plastic zones, International journal of fracture 106(4) (2000) 291-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensitivity to impurities ===
The [[mechanical properties]] of titanium foams are sensitive to the presence of interstitial solutes, which present limitations to processing routes and utilization. Titanium has a high affinity for [[atmospheric gases]]. In foams, this is evidenced by the metal's tendency to trap oxides within cell edges.&lt;ref name = "r22"&gt;M. Barrabés, A. Michiardi, C. Aparicio, P. Sevilla, J.A. Planell, F.J. Gil, Oxidized nickel–titanium foams for bone reconstructions: chemical and mechanical characterization, Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine 18(11) (2007) 2123-2129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "r23"&gt;D.C. Dunand, Processing of titanium foams, Advanced engineering materials 6(6) (2004) 369-376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "r24"&gt;L.-P. Lefebvre, E. Baril, Effect of oxygen concentration and distribution on the compression properties on titanium foams, Advanced Engineering Materials 10(9) (2008) 868-876.&lt;/ref&gt;
Micro-hardness of cell walls, [[elastic modulus]], and [[yield strength]] increase as a result of interstitial solutes; [[ductility]], which is a function of the quantity of interstitial impurities, is consequently reduced.&lt;ref name = "r25"&gt;N. Jha, D. Mondal, J. Dutta Majumdar, A. Badkul, A. Jha, A. Khare, Highly porous open cell Ti-foam using NaCl as temporary space holder through powder metallurgy route, Materials &amp; Design 47 (2013) 810-819.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "r26"&gt;N. Dukhan, Metal foams: fundamentals and applications, DEStech Publications, Inc2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the atmospheric gases, nitrogen has the most significant impact, followed by oxygen and carbon.&lt;ref name = "r27"&gt;J. Luyten, S. Mullens, I. Thijs, Designing with pores—synthesis and applications, KONA Powder Part J 28 (2010) 131-142.&lt;/ref&gt;
These impurities are often present in the precursor mixture and also introduced during processing.

=== Theoretical models for predicting mechanical properties ===
==== Gibson &amp; Ashby models ====

Gibson &amp; Ashby &lt;ref name = "r17"&gt;L.J. Gibson, Cellular solids, Mrs Bulletin 28(4) (2003) 270-271.&lt;/ref&gt; micromechanical models for [[porous materials]] provide mathematical equations for the prediction of mechanical parameters based on experimentally determined geometric constants. The constants of proportionality are determined by fitting experimental data to various mathematical models for structures consisting of cubes and solid struts and are dependent upon cell geometry. A limitation of the Gibson &amp; Ashby &lt;ref name="r17" /&gt; model is that it is most accurate for foams exhibiting porosities higher than 70%, although experimental comparisons for lower porosity foams have shown agreement with this model. 
Ye &amp; Dunand&lt;ref name="r15"&gt;B. Ye, D.C. Dunand, Titanium foams produced by solid-state replication of NaCl powders, Materials Science and Engineering a-Structural Materials Properties Microstructure and Processing 528(2) (2010) 691-697.&lt;/ref&gt; found reasonable agreement to the Gibson &amp; Ashby model for titanium foams exhibiting 42% porosity. Ultrasonic measurements provided an average Young's modulus value of 39 GPa, which is in relatively good agreement with the Gibson &amp; Ashby prediction of 35 GPa.

The Gibson &amp; Ashby&lt;ref name="r17" /&gt; models assume ideal structures; microstructural irregularities (e.g. inhomogeneous pore distribution; defects) are not considered. Additionally, experimental results from which the predetermined proportionality constants were based on experimental values that were obtained from simple compression tests. Consequently, they may not be applicable for multiaxial loads.&lt;ref name = "r28"&gt;S. Maiti, L. Gibson, M. Ashby, Deformation and energy absorption diagrams for cellular solids, Acta metallurgica 32(11) (1984) 1963-1975.&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, the models are an excellent tool for general estimations of mechanical parameters; yet, precise predictive values cannot be relied upon

==== Minimum solid area (MSA) models ====

Minimum solid area models assume that the load bearing area (cross-sectional area normal to the stress) is the logical basis for modeling mechanical behavior.&lt;ref name = "r29"&gt;R.W. Rice, Porosity of ceramics: Properties and applications, CRC Press1998.&lt;/ref&gt; MSA models assume pore interaction results in reduction of stress. Therefore, the minimum solid areas are the carriers of stress. As a result, predicted mechanical properties fluctuate based on the quantification of the solid area of the foam.&lt;ref name = "r30"&gt;M. Scheffler, P. Colombo, Cellular ceramics: Structure, manufacturing, properties and applications, John Wiley &amp; Sons2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
For titanium foams consisting of partially sintered powders, the minimum solid area consists of the neck area between powders through the cross-section of cell walls between macropores.&lt;ref name = "r31"&gt;Z. Esen, Ş. Bor, Processing of titanium foams using magnesium spacer particles, Scripta Materialia 56(5) (2007) 341-344.&lt;/ref&gt;
The mathematical relationships in MSA models&lt;ref name = "r32"&gt;R. Rice, Evaluation and extension of physical property-porosity models based on minimum solid area, Journal of materials science 31(1) (1996) 102-118.&lt;/ref&gt;
are relatively consistent with the Gibson &amp; Ashby&lt;ref name = "r17" /&gt; model.&lt;ref name = "r33"&gt;R. Rice, Comparison of stress concentration versus minimum solid area based mechanical property-porosity relations, Journal of materials science 28(8) (1993) 2187-2190.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the MSA models are designed to predict mechanical property parameters over a broader range of porosity levels. Like the Gibson &amp; Ashby models, MSA models were derived assuming idealized (defect-free) structures containing uniform pore shapes, size and distribution.

=== Compressive properties ===

The most frequently reported mechanical property of titanium foams is compressive strength.&lt;ref name = "r34" /&gt; It was generally accepted that the compressive properties of metal foams depended on the properties of the cell wall rather than on pore size. However, more recent research has indicated that smaller pore sizes equate to higher compressive strength. As pore sizes reach nano-dimensions, the relationship is even more clear due to changes in deformation mechanism.&lt;ref name = "r35" /&gt;
Tuncer &amp; Arslan&lt;ref name = "r36" /&gt; fabricated titanium foams via the space-holder method using various shaped space-holders to elucidate the effect of cell morphology on mechanical properties. They found that foams created with needle-like, carbamide space-holders exhibited a decrease in elastic modulus and yield strength when compared to spherical pores.&lt;ref name = "r36" /&gt;

Here all the credit goes to the Guruji of my Eklavya.

== Processing methods ==

Many metal foam manufacturing techniques are accomplished by the introduction of a gaseous phase into a precursor matrix, which can occur in either molten metal or a powdered metal form. Due to titanium's high melting point (1670&amp;nbsp;°C) and high chemical affinity with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen (which dissolve rapidly either in liquid or solid titanium at a temperature above 400&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name = "r23" /&gt;), solid-state processes based on powder densification are the preferred method of fabrication.&lt;ref name = "r15" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r23" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r31" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r34"&gt;M.M. Shbeh, R. Goodall, Open Celled Porous Titanium, Advanced Engineering Materials 19(11) (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "r40"&gt;N. Davis, J. Teisen, C. Schuh, D. Dunand, Solid-state foaming of titanium by superplastic expansion of argon-filled pores, Journal of Materials Research 16(5) (2001) 1508-1519.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "r41"&gt;D. Elzey, H. Wadley, The limits of solid state foaming, Acta materialia 49(5) (2001) 849-859.&lt;/ref&gt;
Processing methods must also be designed to avoid exposure to air or moisture; vacuum or inert gas sintering processes are usually sufficient for preventing contamination.&lt;ref name = "r23" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r42"&gt;L.P. Lefebvre, E. Baril, Effect of oxygen concentration and distribution on the compression properties on titanium foams, Advanced Engineering Materials 10(9) (2008) 868-876.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loose-powder (gravity) sintering ===
[[File: TitaniumUSGOV.jpg |thumb|Titanium powder]]

[[File:Tisponge.png|thumb|Titanium sponge cylinder produced via powder metallurgy, 120 grams. Original size in cm: 3 x 4. http://images-of-elements.com/titanium.php]]

Utilizing [[powder metallurgy]] routes&lt;ref name = "r43"&gt;W.D. Callister, D.G. Rethwisch, Materials science and engineering: an introduction, Wiley New York2007.&lt;/ref&gt; for titanium foam fabrication allows for production at lower temperatures than those required through a melt process and reduces overall risks for contamination. In loose-powder sintering (also known as gravity sintering), pores are created through diffusion bonding arising from the voids existing between packed powder particles. Axial compaction followed by sintering follows the same procedure as above, but pressures is applied for compaction of the precursor material.&lt;ref name = "r44"&gt;C. Leyens, M. Peters, Titanium and titanium alloys, Wiley Online Library2003.&lt;/ref&gt; For both compaction methods, the resulting pore morphology is dependent upon the morphology of the metallic powder, making it difficult to control the size, shape, and distribution of the pores.&lt;ref name = "r43" /&gt; Another disadvantage includes the relatively high probability of pore collapse and limited achievable porosity levels.&lt;ref name = "r45"&gt;V. Srivastava, K. Sahoo, Processing, stabilization and applications of metallic foams. Art of science, Materials Science-Poland 25(3) (2007) 733-753.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "r46"&gt;L. Zhang, Y. Zhao, Fabrication of high melting-point porous metals by lost carbonate sintering process via decomposition route, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture 222(2) (2008) 267-271.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion of pressurized bubbles ===
[[File:Tiargon.png|thumb|Titanium foamed with argon: https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/fuel-cells/pem_bipolar.php]]
To produce titanium foams via expansion of pressurized gas, the titanium precursor mixture is placed within a gas-tight metal can, which is evacuated after filling. The metal can is pressurized with inert gas—most commonly argon – and is pressed isostatically. The gas-filled pores are contained within the compacted matrix, and upon exposure to elevated temperatures, these bubbles expand through creep of the surrounding metal matrix.&lt;ref name = "r47"&gt;A. Kennedy, S. Asavavisitchai, Effects of TiB&lt;sub&gt; 2&lt;/sub&gt; particle addition on the expansion, structure and mechanical properties of PM Al foams, Scripta Materialia 50(1) (2004) 115-119.&lt;/ref&gt; Since processing titanium foams using [[hot isostatic pressing]] (HIP) eliminates the need for separate compaction  and sintering processes, a wider variety of custom shapes and sizes are possible than via loose powder sintering techniques.&lt;ref name = "r48"&gt;M. Sharma, G. Gupta, O. Modi, B. Prasad, PM processed titanium foam: influence of morphology and content of space holder on microstructure and mechanical properties, Powder Metallurgy 56(1) (2013) 55-60.&lt;/ref&gt;  Disadvantages of this process include reduced pore connectivity, limited achievable porosity, and a complicated experimental set-up.&lt;ref name = "r48" /&gt; However, a unique aspect of the HIP process with respect to titanium (and other polymorphic materials) is that transformation superplasticity can be enhanced through the HIP process by way of thermal cycling, or by cycling around the alpha/beta allotropic temperature boundaries of the metal.&lt;ref name = "r40" /&gt;

=== Superplastic expansion ===
Titanium undergoes allotropic transformation from its α-phase (hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure at temperatures less than 882.5&amp;nbsp;°C) to its β-phase (body centered cubic (BCC) structure at temperatures above 882.3&amp;nbsp;°C). Alpha-phase titanium products typically exhibit medium to high strength with excellent creep strength, whereas beta-phase titanium products typically exhibit very high strength and low ductility.&lt;ref name = "r40" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r44" /&gt; Foams created under thermal cycling conditions have been shown to exhibit increased porosity due to the density difference between allotropic phases. Davis, Teisen, Schuh &amp; Dunand&lt;ref name = "r40" /&gt; produced titanium foams with 41% porosity (as compared to 27% porosity through the normal HIP creep mechanism). Increases in overall ductility were also observed in foams created through thermal cycling. In a similar experiment, porosity of 44% was achieved and determined as the maximum achievable porosity under thermal cycling conditions.&lt;ref name = "r49"&gt;N. Murray, D. Dunand, Microstructure evolution during solid-state foaming of titanium, Composites science and technology 63(16) (2003) 2311-2316.&lt;/ref&gt; A later study also utilized exploitation of transformation superplasticity conditions through HIP, but in this case, the titanium powder in the precursor matrix was replaced with titanium wires to create anisotropic pores. The resulting anisotropic pores showed closer correlation with natural bone in that the foams exhibited higher elastic moduli, yield strength and deformation when subjected to longitudinally loaded forces than when loads were applied transversely.&lt;ref name = "r50"&gt;E.D.

The space-holder technique was first demonstrated by Zhao and Sun&lt;ref name = "r91"&gt;Y. Zhao, D.

The space-holder was mixed into the powder mixture and dissolved prior to sintering. The same method was used to create titanium foams for the first time when Wen et al. &lt;ref name="r87" /&gt; utilized ammonium hydrogen carbonate spacers.

==== Powder selection ====
The size and shape of the metal powder has a direct impact on the stability of the precursor as well as the resulting foam. For this purpose, powders that increase packing efficiency are most advantageous.&lt;ref name = "r36" /&gt; The use of spherical particles may result in less contact of particles which consequently leads to larger secondary pores and a higher probability of pore collapse prior to complete sintering.&lt;ref name = "r92"&gt;N.

Khare, Highly porous open cell Ti-foam using NaCl as temporary space holder through powder metallurgy route, Materials &amp; Design 47 (2013) 810-819&lt;/ref&gt; This factor can be limited through different compaction techniques that decrease the degree of interstitial sites around the titanium particles. However, this method also has limitations; for example, the powders cannot be compacted to such a degree that would promote deformation of the spacer (unless anisotropic pore shape is desired).&lt;ref name = "r15" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r61" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r93"&gt;Y.

[[File:Tisugar.png|thumb|CT cross section (a) and SEM picture (b) of the Ti foam made with saccharose as a space holder, showing two types of pores Titanium foam made with saccharose as a space holder]]
The selection of the space-holder is one of the most crucial steps because it defines many of the properties of the resulting foam, including cell shape, cell size and macroporosity. The space-holder should be inert and represent the size and shape of the desired pores. The porosity may be adjusted anywhere between 50 and 85% without the filler material becoming a part of the resultant foam.&lt;ref name = "r10" /&gt; It is also important to select a spacer that has limited or no solubility in titanium, as this incorporation will affect the mechanical properties of the resulting foam.&lt;ref name = "r94"&gt;A. Mansourighasri, N. Muhamad, A.B. Sulong, Processing titanium foams using tapioca starch as a space holder, Journal of Materials Processing Technology 212(1) (2012) 83-89.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to produce gradient structures in which the porosities differ within the foam based on the differences in spacer size in the preform.&lt;ref name = "r93" /&gt;

==== Space-holder size and shape ====
The degree of homogeneity in pore distribution of the final product is primarily dependent on the adequacy of mixing of the precursor. The difference in particle size between the titanium powders and the spacers directly impacts the ability to adequately mix the preform. The greater the size difference, the more difficult it is to control this process.&lt;ref name = "r94" /&gt; Nonhomogeneous mixing resulting from the use of spacers considerably larger than the titanium particles employed and has shown adverse effects in the stability of the precursor after removal of spacer and in the distribution of porosity.&lt;ref name = "r36" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r45" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r95"&gt;G. Ryan, A. Pandit, D.P. Apatsidis, Fabrication methods of porous metals for use in orthopaedic applications, Biomaterials 27(13) (2006) 2651-2670.&lt;/ref&gt;
Spacer size has been investigated by Tuncer &amp; Sharma in three different studies.&lt;ref name = "r36" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r48" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r85" /&gt; It was shown that the use of a coarse spacer results in thicker pore walls while the use of finer spacers results in enhanced compaction, leading to increased densification. Increased densification is evidenced by a monomodal pore distribution with the employment of fine spacers and a bimodal distribution using coarse spacers. Further, finer spacers result in a more homogenous pore distribution. Sharma et al. &lt;ref name = "r77" /&gt; utilized acicular spacers and achieved porosities up to 60% where pores were undistorted. In samples employing fine particles, porosities up to 70% were achievable before noting distortion in the pores.&lt;ref name = "r85" /&gt; However, the bimodal pore distribution observed in coarse-spacer samples showed to be beneficial in terms of mechanical properties in that higher compressive strengths were observed, beyond those that might exist due to the inverse relationship of porosity and compressive strength alone.&lt;ref name = "r85" /&gt;

==== Compaction ====
The precursor mixture of powders and space-holders are compacted into a mold under a specified pressure. This can be achieved through uniaxial or isostatic processes. The pores resulting from this method are open and interconnected via windows between neighboring pores with the size of the pores partially dependent upon the coordination number and contact area of the resulting compact. Compaction pressure must be high enough to ensure sufficient mechanical strength for retention of pore geometry specified by the space-holder, but not too high enough as to cause deformation of the space-holder.&lt;ref name = "r94" /&gt;

==== Sintering and space-holder removal ====
Spacers can be categorized by their mode of removal: those which are removed thermally when temperature is raised during sintering and those which are dissolved with a solvent, either prior to or after foam formation.&lt;ref name = "r93" /&gt; For spacers removed via thermal mechanisms, the sintering temperature should be high enough to decompose the spacer, but not high enough to induce diffusional bonding between the metal particles. This results in a very fragile compact prior to higher temperature sintering and increases risk of collapse.&lt;ref name = "r93" /&gt;  When employing dissolvable spacers, it is possible to remove the spacer after sintering, which reduces the risk of pore collapse. 
In most cases, foams created using space-holders contain bimodal pore distributions with macro-sized pores resulting from the space-holder particles and micro-sized pores located on the pore walls and resulting from incomplete sintering of the powder matrix. As a result, the macropores typically exhibit rough internal surfaces.&lt;ref name = "r96"&gt;A. Bansiddhi, T. Sargeant, S. Stupp, D. Dunand, Porous NiTi for bone implants: a review, Acta biomaterialia 4(4) (2008) 773-782.&lt;/ref&gt; In some applications, such as for the use of bio-medical implants, this is an advantageous property. Inner porosity (or micro-porosity) has been shown to reduce stiffness; thus, reduce the risk of stress-shielding effects, while also offering improved osseointegration.&lt;ref name="r14"&gt;J.C. Li, D.C. Dunand, Mechanical properties of directionally freeze-cast titanium foams, Acta Materialia 59(1) (2011) 146-158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "r77" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r96" /&gt;

==== Space-holder materials ====

===== Sodium chloride (NaCl) =====
Sodium chloride is the most commonly chosen space-holder for titanium foams&lt;ref name = "r25" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r73" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r75" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r86" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r88" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r89" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r97"&gt;A. Bansiddhi, D. Dunand, Shape-memory NiTi foams produced by replication of NaCl space-holders, Acta biomaterialia 4(6) (2008) 1996-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name = "r99"&gt;L.-J. Chen, T. Li, Y.-M. Li, H. He, Y.-H. Hu, Porous titanium implants fabricated by metal injection molding, Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China 19(5) (2009) 1174-1179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Torres, J. Pavón, J. Rodríguez, Processing and characterization of porous titanium for implants by using NaCl as space holder, Journal of Materials Processing Technology 212(5) (2012) 1061-1069.&lt;/ref&gt; because it is highly soluble in water and inert with respect to titanium. This inertness prevents contamination and degradation of the mechanical properties of the resulting foam. Moreover, NaCl is non-toxic; any residuals are bioinert.&lt;ref name = "r77" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r80" /&gt;

Bansiddhi &amp; Dunand &lt;ref name = "r102"&gt;A. Bansiddhi, D.C. Dunand, Shape-memory NiTi foams produced by replication of NaCl space-holders, Acta Biomaterialia 4(6) (2008) 1996-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; first demonstrated NaCl as a permanent space-holder for the fabrication of NiTi foams. The resulting foams consisted of 32-36% porosity with more complete densification than they observed when producing NiTi foams using a sodium fluoride (NaF) space-holder.&lt;ref name = "r103"&gt;A. Bansiddhi, D.C. Dunand, Shape-memory NiTi foams produced by solid-state replication with NaF, Intermetallics 15(12) (2007) 1612-1622.&lt;/ref&gt; However, processing parameters resulted in molten NaCl and a metal/salt blend in the cavities of the foam. Certain risks are associated with using a molten space-holder including reaction with the metal, dissolving of the space-holder in the metal and prevention of densification through the creation of a thin layer of liquid between the metal and particles.&lt;ref name = "r96" /&gt; Near complete densification was achieved when NaCl was used as a permanent space-holder in pure titanium foam.&lt;ref name = "r15" /&gt; In this case, a temperature below the melting point of NaCl was used; titanium is less creep resistant than NiTi, which allows for densification at lower temperatures. The resulting foams achieved porosity of 50-67% with minimal observable microporosity. Anisotropic pore shape in some areas alluded to NaCl's deformation during HIP, which is desirable for some applications.&lt;ref name = "r88" /&gt; Additionally, an observed, rough inner surface of the pores holds advantages for biomedical implant applications. 
Jha et al.&lt;ref name = "r92" /&gt; achieved 65-80% porosity through the use of NaCl as a space-holder and a cold compaction process at various pressures with two-stage sintering. In this case, NaCl was removed through dissolution after the second stage of sintering. Resulting Young's moduli (8-15 GPa) were considerably lower than the Young's modulus of 29 GPa achieved by Ye &amp; Dunand for 50% porosity foams.&lt;ref name = "r25" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r88" /&gt; This illustrates the known relationship between porosity and Young's modulus wherein Young's modulus decreases linearly with increasing porosity. Achievable porosity through the space-holder method is directly related to the type and amount of space-holder utilized (up to a threshold maximum achievable porosity level).

===== Magnesium =====

Magnesium can be removed either thermally or by reactive measures through the dissolution in acid.&lt;ref name = "r31" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r104"&gt;T. Aydoğmuş, Ş. Bor, Processing of porous TiNi alloys using magnesium as space holder, Journal of alloys and compounds 478(1) (2009) 705-710.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name = "r105"&gt;S.W. Kim, H.-D. Jung, M.-H. Kang, H.-E. Kim, Y.-H. Koh, Y. Estrin, Fabrication of porous titanium scaffold with controlled porous structure and net-shape using magnesium as spacer, Materials Science and Engineering: C 33(5) (2013) 2808-2815.&lt;/ref&gt; Esen &amp; Bor &lt;ref name = "r31" /&gt; found a critical content of magnesium as a space holder to be 55-60%, above which compacts shrink excessively during sintering. Foams ranging in porosity from 45 to 70% with a bimodal pore distribution and compressive strength of 15 MPa (for 70% porosity) were demonstrated. Kim et al.,&lt;ref name = "r105" /&gt;  fabricated foams with anisotropic pores through the intentional deformation of Mg particles during compaction in an effort to enhance mechanical properties. A final porosity of 70% equated to a yield strength of 38 MPa for normal orientation of pores and 59 MPa when pores were aligned with the direction of compression.

===== Carbamide (urea) =====

Another commonly employed space-holder for titanium foams is carbamide; demonstrated porosities range from 20-75%.&lt;ref name = "r36" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r75" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r77" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r84" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r85" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r87" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r106"&gt;G. Kotan, A.Ş. Bor, Production and characterization of high porosity Ti-6Al-4V foam by space holder technique in powder metallurgy, Turkish Journal of Engineering and Environmental Sciences 31(3) (2007) 149-156.&lt;/ref&gt; Wen et al. &lt;ref name = "r87" /&gt; produced foams exhibiting a bimodal pore distribution with porosities ranging from 55-75%, Young's moduli between 3-6.4 GPa, and a plateau stress of 10-35 MPa. An inverse relationship between plateau stress and porosity was observed with increased porosity resulting in decreased plateau stress.&lt;ref name = "r87" /&gt; Tuncer et al. &lt;ref name = "r84" /&gt; utilized carbamide in combination with irregular shaped titanium powders in an effort to increase green strength through increased packing efficiency (of particles). This also eliminated the need for the incorporation of a binder.

===== Tapioca starch =====
Tapioca starch can be burnt off easily through the sintering process and is insoluble in titanium. Titanium foams consisting of a bimodal pore distribution (macropores ranging from 100-300 μm) and 64-79% porosity, exhibited yield strengths of 23-41 MPa and Young's moduli of 1.6-3.7 GPa.&lt;ref name = "r72" /&gt;

===== Ammonium bicarbonate =====
Although ammonium bicarbonate has been utilized in the manufacturing of titanium foams,&lt;ref name = "r63" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r79" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r87" /&gt; it is not an ideal spacer in that it has a low melting/dissociation point and some solubility in titanium.&lt;ref name = "r67" /&gt; This results in considerable shrinkage which makes control of pore shape difficult. Furthermore, the decomposition releases environmentally harmful gases.&lt;ref name = "r51" /&gt;

=== Freeze-casting ===

pore structures have been produced, through the use of non-aqueous and aqueous processing respectively. These materials exhibit anisotropic mechanical properties as a result of their anisotropic pore structures. Compressive strength for loads applied parallel to the wall direction of titanium foams are found to be, on average, 2.5 times greater than for those applied perpendicular to the wall direction.&lt;ref name = "r108" /&gt;

== Applications ==

Potential structural applications for titanium foams include their general incorporation into light-weight structures and as components for mechanical energy absorption. The most important considerations for the use of titanium foams in structural applications includes their porosity, specific strength, ductility in compression and cost. Because of low manufacturing costs, most metal foams marketed for structural applications are of a close-celled aluminum variety.&lt;ref name = "r117"&gt;Y. Zhao, T. Fung, L. Zhang, F. Zhang, Lost carbonate sintering process for manufacturing metal foams, Scripta Materialia 52(4) (2005) 295-298.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, titanium foam manufacturing incurs a higher cost, but this cost is defensible in space applications where the material offers an otherwise incomparable reduction in overall weight. The lower thermal conductivity of titanium may also be appreciated in rocket construction.&lt;ref name = "r1" /&gt; The specific strength, overall energy absorbing capability and high melting point all reinforce titanium's superiority to aluminum in aerospace and military applications.&lt;ref name = "r3" /&gt; When used for aerospace applications, levels of porosity close to 90% are desired.&lt;ref name = "r80" /&gt;
Titanium foams are capable of retaining their high tensile strength at temperatures up to 400&amp;nbsp;°C; a limit imposed by the metal's low resistance to oxidation.&lt;ref name = "r44" /&gt;

=== Aerospace applications ===
The driving force for titanium foam's replacement of existing materials in the aerospace sector results from the following five factors:&lt;ref name = "r44" /&gt;

•	Weight reduction: as a substitute for steels and nickel-based superalloys;

•	Application temperature: as a substitute for aluminum and nickel-based alloys and steels

•	Corrosion resistance: as a substitute for aluminum alloys and low-alloyed steels

•	Galvanic compatibility: with polymer matrix composites as substitutes for aluminum alloys

•	Space constraints: as substitutes for aluminum alloys and steels

The most urgent problem of engineering and its advanced branch of aerospace engineering is
the efficient use of materials as well as increased service life.&lt;ref name = "r1" /&gt;

==== Sandwich panel cores ====
[[File: Aluminium composite material.png|thumb|Model of a sandwich panel assembly]]

Sandwich panel cores are used throughout the aerospace industry; they are integrated within aircraft bodies, floors and internal panels. Sandwich constructions consist of two faces separated by a thick, light-weight core and are most commonly composed of balsa-wood, foamed polymers, glue-bonded aluminum or Nomex (paper) honeycombs. Typically, the cores are combined with reinforcing fibers to increase their shear modulus.&lt;ref name = "r118"&gt;S. Yang, C. Qi, D. Wang, R. Gao, H. Hu, J. Shu, A Comparative Study of Ballistic Resistance of Sandwich Panels with Aluminum Foam and Auxetic Honeycomb Cores, Advances in Mechanical Engineering 2013 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, carbon fiber-reinforced polymers exhibit the highest specific stiffness and strength of these materials.&lt;ref name = "r119"&gt;K. Finnegan, G. Kooistra, H.N. Wadley, V. Deshpande, The compressive response of carbon fiber composite pyramidal truss sandwich cores, International Journal of Materials Research 98(12) (2007) 1264-1272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "r120"&gt;S. Park, B. Russell, V. Deshpande, N. Fleck, Dynamic compressive response of composite square honeycombs, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 43(3) (2012) 527-536.&lt;/ref&gt; However, polymers decompose at low temperatures; thus employment of the aforementioned materials pose inherent challenges due to the limited range of temperature they may be utilized within as well as their moisture-dependent properties.&lt;ref name = "r13" /&gt;
The largest and most inadequately predicted failure within the core results from strain localization. Strain localization refers to the development of bands exhibiting intensive straining as a result of the localization of deformations in the solid.&lt;ref name = "r121"&gt;F. Zok*, H. Rathbun, M. He, E. Ferri, C. Mercer, R. McMeeking, A. Evans, Structural performance of metallic sandwich panels with square honeycomb cores, Philosophical Magazine 85(26-27) (2005) 3207-3234.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luyten, S. Mullens, I. Thijs, Designing with pores-synthesis and applications, KONA Powder and Particle Journal 28 (2010) 131-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Titanium foams are lightweight, stiff, and possess the capability to resist blast. Furthermore, the use of titanium-based foams exhibiting homogenous porosity distribution would significantly decrease the risks associated with strain localization. The high strength-to-weight ratio of titanium foams offers an opportunity to provide increased bending and shearing stiffness as well as energy absorption capabilities during periods of bending.&lt;ref name = "r118" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r122" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r123"&gt;P.

Composite structures may also be produced; the incorporation of silicon carbide monofilaments into Ti-6-Al-4V foams was shown to exhibit an elastic modulus of 195 GPa and tensile strength of 800 MPa.&lt;ref name = "r124"&gt;P.

==== Bioimplants: Microstructure ====
Biomedical implants should have low density for patient comfort and high porosity and surface area to facilitate vascularization and the ingrowth of new bone.&lt;ref name = "r140"&gt;J. Jakubowicz, G. Adamek, M. Dewidar, Titanium foam made with saccharose as a space holder, Journal of Porous Materials 20(5) (2013) 1137-1141.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, the implant will allow sufficiently easy fluid flow for cell nutrition and osteoblast multiplication as well as migration for cellular colonization of the implant to become uniform. The pores contained within the foam's cellular matrix mimic the extracellular matrix of bone, allowing the body to fixate with the implant. The porosity of the implant also promotes apposition and facilitates vascularization−as cells are able to attach, reproduce and form basic functions.&lt;ref name = "r86" /&gt; It has been shown that a macropore size of 200-500&amp;nbsp;µm is preferred for ingrowths of new bone tissues and transportation of body fluids. The lower bound is controlled by the size of cells (~20&amp;nbsp;µm), and the upper bound is related to the specific surface area through the availability of binding sites.&lt;ref name = "r86"/&gt; Finer pores further help in tissue growth and biofluid movement.&lt;ref name = "r141"&gt;K. Abshagen, I. Schrodi, T. Gerber, B. Vollmar, In vivo analysis of biocompatibility and vascularization of the synthetic bone grafting substitute NanoBone®, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A 91(2) (2009) 557-566.&lt;/ref&gt; Anisotropic, elongated pores (such as those attainable via the freeze-casting technique) may be beneficial in bone implants in that they can further mimic the structure of bone.

The porous surface geometry of the foam promotes bone in-growth, provides anchorage for fixation, and ensures stresses are transferred from the implant to the bone.&lt;ref name = "r37"&gt;I.-H. Oh, N. Nomura, N. Masahashi, S. Hanada, Mechanical properties of porous titanium compacts prepared by powder sintering, Scripta Materialia 49(12) (2003) 1197-1202.&lt;/ref&gt; Surface roughness in the pore can enhance bone in-growth, and coarser cell size facilitates faster tissue growth.&lt;ref name = "r88" /&gt;
To optimize the implant's functionality and ability to successfully fuse with bone, it may be necessary to manipulate the material's manufacturing methods in order to modify the foam's pore structure. Changes in pore structure can directly influence implant strength as well as other key properties.

==== Bioimplants: Mechanical properties ====

Human cancellous bone possesses a stiffness ranging from 12-23 GPa;&lt;ref name = "r142"&gt;C. Greiner, S.M. Oppenheimer, D.C. Dunand, High strength, low stiffness, porous NiTi with superelastic properties, Acta Biomaterialia 1(6) (2005) 705-716.&lt;/ref&gt; careful control and modification of manufacturing parameters to achieve similar strengths is imperative for practicality of integration.&lt;ref name = "r143"&gt;M.S. Aly, Effect of pore size on the tensile behavior of open-cell Ti foams: Experimental results, Materials letters 64(8) (2010) 935-937.&lt;/ref&gt;  Correctly predicting the Young's modulus for foams is imperative for actual biomedical integration; a mismatch of Young's moduli between the implant and the bone  can result in stress-shielding effects from a disproportional handling of stress.&lt;ref name = "r144"&gt;L.E. Murr, S.M. Gaytan, E. Martinez, F. Medina, R.B. Wicker, Next generation orthopaedic implants by additive manufacturing using electron beam melting, International journal of biomaterials 2012 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The implant which typically exhibits a higher Young's modulus than the bone will absorb most of the load. As a result of this imbalance, the starting bone density will be reduced, there will be tissue death and, eventually, implant failure.&lt;ref name = "r145"&gt;H. Li, S.M. Oppenheimer, S.I. Stupp, D.C. Dunand, L.C. Brinson, Effects of pore morphology and bone ingrowth on mechanical properties of microporous titanium as an orthopaedic implant material, Materials Transactions 45(4) (2004) 1124-1131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural bone exhibits the ability to adjust local fiber away from the low-stress regions toward high stress regions through the distribution of porosity, thus maximizing overall comfort.&lt;ref name = "r146"&gt;Y. Conde, A. Pollien, A. Mortensen, Functional grading of metal foam cores for yield-limited lightweight sandwich beams, Scripta Materialia 54(4) (2006) 539-543.&lt;/ref&gt; Using finite element analysis, researchers examined the effect of filling pores with bone on mechanical properties.&lt;ref name = "r145" /&gt; They concluded that bone ingrowth significantly improved the mechanical properties, evidenced by decreased localized plasticity and stress concentrations. In effect, the titanium foam in the study allowed the bone to exhibit its natural ability to adjust local fiber away from the low-stress regions toward high stress regions.

Previous experimentation and analysis has demonstrated that random combinations of pore size and shape result in lower Young's moduli. Theoretical models for the quantification of Young's moduli do not account for random pore size and shape distribution, so experimental measurements must be conducted in the presence of heterogeneous pore size and distribution. This is a limitation of the micro-mechanical models discussed above.

==== Osseointegration ====
Currently utilized implants take a great deal of time to integrate with the body after the initial surgical procedure occurs. True adhesion between the implant and the bone has been difficult to achieve and, unfortunately, success rates of implant fixation are low due to the implant's failure to achieve long-term osseointegration into the bone.&lt;ref name = "r95" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r96" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r147"&gt;H.-W. Kim, Y.-H. Koh, L.-H. Li, S. Lee, H.-E. Kim, Hydroxyapatite coating on titanium substrate with titania buffer layer processed by sol–gel method, Biomaterials 25(13) (2004) 2533-2538.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanci, Initial evaluation of bone ingrowth into a novel porous titanium coating, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials 94(1) (2010) 64-71.&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasing number of individuals requiring orthopedic implants,&lt;ref name = "r11" /&gt; the development of materials with structural and biological potential to improve osseointegration is crucial. Utilization of titanium-based foams present one way to potentially improve the bioactivity &lt;ref name = "r6" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r149"&gt;V.D. Rani, K. Manzoor, D. Menon, N. Selvamurugan, S.V.

Nguyen, Corrosion behavior and biocompatibility of nanostructured TiO2 film on Ti6Al4V, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A 83(4) (2007) 1087-1095&lt;/ref&gt; and reduce stress-shielding effects of currently employed bioimplant materials.

The problem of osseointegration is best understood by examining the process of natural bone growth. In the body, bone and tissues experience self-regeneration, and structural modifications occur normally in response to environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name = "r152"&gt;D.W. Hutmacher, Scaffolds in tissue engineering bone and cartilage, Biomaterials 21(24) (2000) 2529-2543&lt;/ref&gt; Successful osseointegration occurs in three main stages that follow a natural biologically determined procedure: (1) incorporation of the implant into the bone's formation, (2) adaption of the new bone mass to carry weight and (3) remodeling of the new bone structure. The first stage in this process is the most crucial for overall success;&lt;ref name = "r153" /&gt; the implant and the bone must form a rapid connection, and this bond must be strong and enduring. Due to its porous structure, a titanium metal foam implant may be able to achieve close fixation with the bone and will decrease patient recovery time considerably. Essentially, the foam becomes an extracellular matrix in the body as tissue is integrated into it.&lt;ref name = "r86" /&gt; Today, the implants most commonly used for bone replacement lack the ability to promote these characteristics, which are found in natural bone and, as a result, the implants have limited lifetimes.&lt;ref name = "r86" /&gt; This phenomenon of osseointegration works similarly to direct fracture healing. However, instead of a bone fragment-end reconnecting to bone, the fragment-end connects to an implant surface.&lt;ref name = "r153"&gt;S.N. Khan, M. Ramachandran, S.S. Kumar, V. Krishnan, R. Sundaram, Osseointegration and more–A review of literature, Indian Journal of Dentistry 3(2) (2012) 72-76.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study on fibroblastic interactions with high porosity Ti6Al4V, the metal foam was supportive of cell attachment and proliferation, migration through the porous network, and proved capable of sustaining a large cell population.&lt;ref name = "r7" /&gt;

==== Increasing bioactivity via coatings ====
Titanium's propensity to form an oxide layer on its surface prevents corrosion of surfaces that are in contact with human tissues because the surface oxides minimize diffusion of metal ions from the bulk material to the surface.&lt;ref name = "r144" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "r154"&gt;C. Leyens, M. Peters, Titanium and titanium alloys: fundamentals and applications, John Wiley &amp; Sons2003.&lt;/ref&gt; When titanium gains a coating to make it more bioactive, it can turn the already biocompatible titanium surface into an interface able to enhance osteoblast adhesion and able to promote osseointegration.&lt;ref name = "r145" /&gt; Today, research is heavily focused on improving the success rate of integration and uses an understanding of the natural process of bone growth and repair to create coatings that will enhance the surface finish and surface properties of the implant. These adjustments allow the artificial structure to mimic biological materials and to gain acceptance into the body with fewer negative side effects.&lt;ref name = "r155"&gt;M. Lutolf, J. Hubbell, Synthetic biomaterials as instructive extracellular microenvironments for morphogenesis in tissue engineering, Nature biotechnology 23(1) (2005) 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name = "r156"&gt;Z. Tang, N.A. Kotov, S. Magonov, B. Ozturk, Nanostructured artificial nacre, Nature materials 2(6) (2003) 413&lt;/ref&gt;
A 3-year clinical and radiographic study found implants in humans coated by nanocrystalline HA to support osseointegration. The nanocrystalline HA was developed with a large rough surface of interconnecting pores between 10 and 20&amp;nbsp;nm of the silica matrix gel, resulting in a porous bone structure. Mean rates of marginal bone loss were insignificant and the periotest values were indicative of a solid osseointegration.&lt;ref name = "r157"&gt;F. Heinemann, T. Mundt, R. Biffar, T. Gedrange, W. Goetz, A 3-year clinical and radiographic study of implants placed simultaneously with maxillary sinus floor augmentations using a new nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite, Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 60(supplement 8) (2009) 91-97.&lt;/ref&gt;
In effect, the pores are structured in such a way that they are able hold onto the proteins on the biomaterial's surface. Ideally, this allows the body to engage in self-repair in that the synthetic HA is recognized as a like-nanomaterial in which live tissues may develop&lt;ref name = "r10" /&gt;
[[File:Ticoating.png|thumb|https://www.intechopen.com/books/biomaterials-science-and-engineering/porous-apatite-coating-on-various-titanium-metallic-materials-via-low-temperature-processing]]

Titanium foams can be coated with HA through various methods including plasma spraying, sol-gel and electrophoretic deposition. It has been shown that HA-coated titanium exhibits increased interfacial strength in comparison to titanium foams without the coating. In an effort to enhance bone in-growth, Spoerke et al. developed a method for growing organoapatites on titanium implants. Organoapatites may assist in-bone in-growth at the implant interface. The foams were manufactured using a modified HIP process, which exploits the allotropic nature of titanium to create higher porosity foams. Previous in vitro experimentation with the organoapatite-titanium foam held promising results including the possibility that ingrown tissue within these coated pores will improve the lifetime use of the foam through reduction of stress-shielding effects.&lt;ref name = "r50" /&gt;

==== Animal studies ====
In the lab, synthetic nanocrystalline bone grafting material in mice has shown in-growth of vascularized fibrous tissue which resulted in improved healing. Furthermore, new blood vessels were observed at day 5 after implantation, and the implant showed a high functional vessel density.&lt;ref name = "r141" /&gt; In a study examining the femoral epiphyses of rabbits in two to eight weeks of healing, bone-to-implant contact was compared to bone growth inside the chambers for four different implant surfaces. The researchers found that bone substitute materials may improve the bone apposition onto titanium.&lt;ref name = "r158"&gt;B.M. Willie, X. Yang, N.H. Kelly, J. Merkow, S. Gagne, R. Ware, T.M. Wright, M.P. Bostrom, Osseointegration into a novel titanium foam implant in the distal femur of a rabbit, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials 92(2) (2010) 479-488&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Stanene}}
[[Stanene]] is a predicted [[topological insulator]] that may display dissipationless currents at its edges near [[Room-temperature superconductor|room temperature]].

=== Phosphorene ===

[[Phosphorene]] is a 2-dimensional, [[crystal]]line [[allotrope]] of [[phosphorus]]. Its mono-atomic hexagonal structure makes it conceptually similar to graphene.

The synthesis of phosphorene mainly consists of micromechanical cleavage or liquid phase exfoliation methods. The former has a low yield while the latter produce free standing nanosheets in solvent and not on the solid support. The bottom up approaches like chemical vapor deposition are still blank because of its high reactivity. Therefore, in the current scenario, the most effective method for large area fabrication of thin films of phosphorene consists of wet assembly techniques like Langmuir-Blodgett involving the assembly followed by deposition of nanosheets on solid supports&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep34095 | pmid = 27671093| pmc = 5037434| title = Large Area Fabrication of Semiconducting Phosphorene by Langmuir-Blodgett Assembly| journal = Sci.

=== Bismuthene ===

Bismuthene, the two-dimensional allotrope of [[bismuth]], was synthesized on [[silicon carbide]] in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6348/287|title = Bismuthene on a SiC substrate: A candidate for a high-temperature quantum spin Hall material|date = July 21, 2017|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.aai8142 |pmid =28663438|access-date =|volume=357|issue = 6348|pages=287–290|bibcode =2017Sci...357..287R |pmc=| last1 = Reis | first1 = Felix | last2 = Li| first2 = Gang | last3 = Dudy | first3 = Lenart | last4 = Bauernfiend | first4 = Maximilian | last5 = Glass | first5 = Stefan | last6 = Hanke | first6 = Werner | last7 = Thomale | first7 = Ronny | last8 = Schaefer | first8 = Joerg | last9 = Claessen | first9 = Ralph|arxiv = 1608.00812}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is predicted to be a [[topological insulator]]. At first glance the system is similar to graphene, as the Bi atoms arrange in a honeycomb lattice. However the [[bandgap]] is as large as 800mV due to the large [[spin-orbit-coupling]] of the Bi atoms and their interaction with the substrate. Thus, room-temperature applications of the [[quantum spin Hall effect]] come into reach.

[[File:graphane.png|thumb|Graphane]]

[[Graphane]] is a [[polymer]] of carbon and [[hydrogen]] with the [[formula unit]] {{chem|(CH)|n}} where ''n'' is large. Graphane is a form of fully [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] (on both sides) graphene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Sofo, Jorge O.|title = Graphane: A two-dimensional hydrocarbon| journal = Physical Review B| year = 2007| volume =  75 | issue = 15 |pages = 153401–4 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.75.153401|arxiv = cond-mat/0606704 |bibcode = 2007PhRvB..75o3401S |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial hydrogenation is then hydrogenated graphene.&lt;ref name="Graphane"&gt;{{cite journal| author= D.

Graphane's carbon bonds are in [[Sp3 bond|''sp''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; configuration]], as opposed to graphene's ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bond configuration. Thus graphane is a two-dimensional analog of cubic [[diamond]].

The first theoretical description of graphane was reported in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sluiter | first1 = Marcel | last2 = Kawazoe | first2 = Yoshiyuki | title = Cluster expansion method for adsorption: Application to hydrogen chemisorption on graphene | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 68 | page = 085410 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.68.085410|bibcode = 2003PhRvB..68h5410S | issue = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its preparation was reported in 2009.

Graphane can be formed by electrolytic hydrogenation of graphene, few-layer graphene or high-oriented [[pyrolytic graphite]]. In the last case mechanical exfoliation of hydrogenated top layers can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= A. M. Ilyin|title =Computer simulation and experimental study of graphane-like structures formed by electrolytic hydrogenation| journal = Physica E|year =2011|volume =43 | doi = 10.1016/j.physe.2011.02.012|issue= 6|pages= 1262–65|bibcode = 2011PhyE...43.1262I |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

p-doped graphane is postulated to be a [[high-temperature superconductor|high-temperature]] [[BCS theory]] [[superconductor]] with a T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; above 90 [[kelvin|K]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= G.

2D boron nitride structures are excellent [[thermal conductor]]s,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; with a [[thermal conductivity]] range of 100-270 W/mK.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; It has been suggested that single layer boron nitride nanosheets have a greater thermal conductivity&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; than other forms of boron nitride nanosheets due to decreased [[phonon scattering]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; from subsequent layers.

The thermal stability of boron nitride nanosheets is very high due to the high thermal stability properties of hexagonal boron nitride.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Lu Hua|last2=Cervenka|first2=Jiri|last3=Watanabe|first3=Kenji|last4=Taniguchi|first4=Takashi|last5=Chen|first5=Ying|date=2014-02-25|title=Strong Oxidation Resistance of Atomically Thin Boron Nitride Nanosheets|journal=ACS Nano|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1457–1462|doi=10.1021/nn500059s|pmid=24400990|issn=1936-0851}}&lt;/ref&gt; As single layer and few-layer boron nitride nanosheets begin to oxidize and lose their electrical properties at 800&amp;nbsp;°C, they are excelle

===== ''CVD'' =====
{{Main|Chemical vapor deposition}}

[[Chemical vapor deposition]] is a popular synthesis method to produce boron nitride because it is a highly controllable process that produces high quality and defect free monolayer and few-layer boron nitride nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":54"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Zifeng|last2=Tang|first2=Zijie|last3=Xue|first3=Qi|last4=Huang|first4=Yan|last5=Huang|first5=Yang|last6=Zhu|first6=Minshen|last7=Pei|first7=Zengxia|last8=Li|first8=Hongfei|last9=Jiang|first9=Hongbo|date=2016-06-01|title=Fabrication of Boron Nitride Nanosheets by Exfoliation|journal=The Chemical Record|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=1204–1215|doi=10.1002/tcr.201500302|pmid=27062213|issn=1528-0691}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of CVD methods, boron and nitride precursors react with a metal substrate at high temperature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This allows for nanosheets of a large area as the layers grow uniformly on the substrate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There is a wide range of boron and nitride precursors such as [[borazine]] and selection of these precursors depend on factors such as toxicity,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; stability,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; reactivity,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the nature of the CVD method.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":54"/&gt; However, despite the high quality of the nanosheets synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, it is not a good method for the large scale production of boron nitride nanosheets for applications.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

===== ''Mechanical'' ''cleavage'' =====
While there are several mechanical cleaving methods to produce boron nitride nanosheets, they employ the same principle: using shear forces to break the Van der Waals interactions between the layers of boron nitride.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The advantage of mechanical cleavage is that the nanosheets isolated from these techniques have few defects and retain the lateral size of the original substrate.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Inspired by its use in the isolation of graphene, micromechanical cleavage, also known as the Scotch-tape method, has been used to consistently isolate few-layer and monolayer boron nitride nanosheets by subsequent exfoliation of the beginning material with adhesive tape.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; However, the disadvantage of this technique is that it is not scalable for large scale production.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Ball milling]] is another technique used to mechanically exfoliate boron nitride sheets from the parent substrate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Lu Hua|last2=Chen|first2=Ying|last3=Behan|first3=Gavin|last4=Zhang|first4=Hongzhou|last5=Petravic|first5=Mladen|last6=Glushenkov|first6=Alexey M.|date=2011-08-03|title=Large-scale mechanical peeling of boron nitride nanosheets by low-energy ball milling|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c1jm11192b|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry|language=en|volume=21|issue=32|doi=10.1039/c1jm11192b|issn=1364-5501|page=11862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; In this process, shear forces are applied on the face of bulk boron nitride by rolling balls, which break the Van der Waal interactions between each layer.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":54"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While the ball milling technique may allow for large quantities of boron nitride nanosheets, it does not allow for control the size or the number of layers of the resulting nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, these nanosheets have more defects due to the aggressive nature of this technique.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, improvements such as the addition of a milling agent such as benzyl benzoate&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; or the use of smaller balls&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; has allowed for a greater yield of higher quality nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Boron nitride nanosheets have also been isolated by using a vortex fluidic device, which uses centripetal force to shear off layers of boron nitride.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===== ''Unzipping of boron nitride nanotubes'' =====
Boron nitride nanosheets may also be synthesized by the unzipping of boron nitride [[nanotube]]s (BNNT).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These nanotubes can be made into sheets by breaking the bonds connecting the N and B atoms by potassium [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]]&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; or by etching by plasma or an inert gas.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The unzipping of boron nitride nanotubes by plasma can be used to control the size of the nanosheets, but it produces [[Semiconducting material|semiconducting]] boron nitride nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The potassium intercalation method produces a low yield of nanosheets as boron nitride is resistive to the effects of intercalants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== ''Solvent exfoliation and sonication'' =====
Solvent exfoliation is often used in tandem with [[sonication]] to break the weak Van der Waals interactions present in bulk boron nitride to isolate large quantities of boron nitride nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; Polar solvents such as [[isopropyl alcohol]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and [[2,5-Dimethylfuran|DMF]]&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhi|first=Chunyi|last2=Bando|first2=Yoshio|last3=Tang|first3=Chengchun|last4=Kuwahara|first4=Hiroaki|last5=Golberg|first5=Dimitri|date=2009-07-27|title=Large-Scale Fabrication of Boron Nitride Nanosheets and Their Utilization in Polymeric Composites with Improved Thermal and Mechanical Properties|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=21|issue=28|pages=2889–2893|doi=10.1002/adma.200900323|issn=1521-4095}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been found to be more effective in exfoliating boron nitride layers than nonpolar solvents because these solvents possess a similar [[surface energy]] to the surface energy of boron nitride nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Combinations of different solvents also exfoliate boron nitride better than when the solvents were used individually.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; However, many solvents that can be used to exfoliate boron nitride are fairly toxic and expensive.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Common solvents such as water and isopropyl alcohol have been determined to be comparable to these toxic polar solvents in exfoliating boron nitride sheets.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===== ''Chemical functionalization and sonication'' =====
Chemical functionalization of boron nitride involves attaching molecules onto the outer and inner layers of bulk boron nitride.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are three types of functionalization that can be done to boron nitride: covalent functionalization, ionic functionalization, or non covalent functionalization.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Layers are then exfoliated by placing the functionalized boron nitride into a solvent and allow the solvation force between the attached groups and the solvent to overcome the Van der Waal forces present in each layer.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This method is slightly different than solvent exfoliation as solvent exfoliation relies on the similarities between the surface energies of the solvent and boron nitride layers to overcome the Van der Waals interactions.

===== ''Solid State Reactions'' =====
The reaction of a mixture of boron and nitrogen precursors at high temperature can produce boron nitride nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In one method, boric acid and urea were reacted together at 900˚C.&lt;ref name=":54"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The numbers of layers of these nanosheets were controlled by the urea content as well as the temperature&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Solution phase lithium intercalation and exfolation of bulk molybdenum sulfide produces molybdenum sulfide layers with metallic and semiconducting character due to the distribution of 1T and 2H geometries within the material.&lt;ref name=":54"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":133"/&gt; This is due to the two forms of molybdenum sulfide monolayers having different electrical properties.

Exfoliation techniques for the isolating of molybdenum disulfide monolayers include mechanical exfoliation,&lt;ref name=":133"/&gt; solvent assisted exfoliation,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; and chemical exfolation.&lt;ref name=":54"/&gt;

Solvent assisted exfoliation is done by sonicating bulk molybdenum disulfide in an organic solvent such as isopropanol and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, which disperses the bulk material into nanosheets as the Van der Waals interactions between the layers in the bulk materaial are broken.&lt;ref name=":133"/&gt; The amount of nanosheets produced is controlled by the sonication time,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; the solvent-molybdenum disulfide interactions,&lt;ref name=":133"/&gt; and the centrifuge speed.&lt;ref name=":133"/&gt; Compared to other exfoliation techniques, solvent assisted exfoliation is the simplest method for large scale production of molybdenum disulfide nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kannan|first=Padmanathan Karthick|last2=Late|first2=Dattatray J.|last3=Morgan|first3=Hywel|last4=Rout|first4=Chandra Sekhar|date=2015-08-06|title=Recent developments in 2D layered inorganic nanomaterials for sensing|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C5NR03633J|journal=Nanoscale|language=en|volume=7|issue=32|pages=13293–13312|doi=10.1039/c5nr03633j|pmid=26204797|issn=2040-3372|bibcode=2015Nanos...713293K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The micromechanical exfoliation of molybdenum disulfide was inspired by the same technique used in the isolation of graphene nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Micromechanical exfoliation allows for low defect molybdenum disulfide nanosheets but is not suitable for large scale production due to low yield.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Chemical exfoliation involves functionalizing molybdenum difsulfide and then sonicating to disperse the nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The most notable chemical exfoliation technique is lithium intercalation in which lithium is intercalated into bulk molybdenum disulfide and then dispersed into nanosheets by the addition of water.&lt;ref name=":54"/&gt;

====== ''Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)'' ======
Chemical vapor deposition of molybdenum disulfide nanosheets involves reacting molybdenum and sulfur precursors on a substrate at high temperatures.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; This technique is often used in the preparing electrical devices with molybdenum disulfide components because the nanosheets are applied directly on the substrate; unfavorable interactions between the substrate and the nanosheets that would have occurred had they been separately synthesized are decreased.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In addition, since the thickness and area of the molybdenum disulfide nanosheets can be controlled by the selection of specific precursors, the electrical properties of the nanosheets can be tuned.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

====== ''Laser ablation'' ======
Pulsed laser deposition involves the thinning of bulk molybdenum disulfide by laser  to produce single or multi-layer molybdenum disulfide nanosheets.&lt;ref name=":133"/&gt; This allows for synthesis of molybdenum disulfide nanosheets with a defined shape and size.&lt;ref name=":54"/&gt; The quality of the nanosheets are determined by the energy of the laser and the irradation angle.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Lasers can also be used to form molybdenum disulfide nanosheets from molybdenum disulfide [[fullerene]]-like molecules.&lt;ref name="Wu 1276–1281"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Haihua|last2=Yang|first2=Rong|last3=Song|first3=Baomin|last4=Han|first4=Qiusen|last5=Li|first5=Jingying|last6=Zhang|first6=Ying|last7=Fang|first7=Yan|last8=Tenne|first8=Reshef|last9=Wang|first9=Chen|title=Biocompatible Inorganic Fullerene-Like Molybdenum Disulfide Nanoparticles Produced by Pulsed Laser Ablation in Water|journal=ACS Nano|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=1276–1281|doi=10.1021/nn102941b|pmid=21230008|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tungsten diselenide ====

Tungsten diselenide is an [[inorganic compound]] with the formula {{chem|WSe|2}}. The compound adopts a hexagonal crystalline structure similar to [[molybdenum disulfide]]. Every [[tungsten]] atom is covalently bonded to six [[selenium]] ligands in a trigonal prismatic coordination sphere, while each selenium is bonded to three tungsten atoms in a pyramidal geometry. The tungsten – selenium bond has a bond distance of 2.526 Å and the distance between selenium atoms is 3.34 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schutte | first1 = W.J. | last2 = De Boer | first2 =  J.L. | last3 = Jellinek | first3 = F. | title = Crystal Structures of Tungsten Disulfide and Diselenide | journal = Journal of Solid State Chemistry | year = 1986 | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–209 | doi = 10.1016/0022-4596(87)90057-0|bibcode = 1987JSSCh..70..207S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Layers stack together via [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals interactions]]. {{chem|WSe|2}} is a stable [[semiconductor]] in the group-VI [[transition metal dichalcogenide]]s.

==== Hafnium Disulphide ====
Hafnium Disulphide is a group IVB TMD with formula {{chem|HfS|2}}. Like other TMDs, it possess a layered structure with strong covalent bonding between the Hf and S atoms in a layer and weak Van der Wall forces between layers. The compound has {{chem|CdI|2}} type structure and is an indirect band gap semiconducting material. The interlayer spacing between the layers is 0.56&amp;nbsp;nm, which is small compared to group VIB TMDs like {{chem|MoS|2}}, making it difficult to cleave its atomic layers. However, recently its crystals with large interlayer spacing has grown using a chemical vapor transport route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kaur|first1=Harneet|title=High Yield Synthesis and Chemical Exfoliation of Two-Dimensional Layered Hafnium Disulphide|journal=Nano Research|volume=11|pages=343–353|arxiv=1611.00895|year=2016|doi=10.1007/s12274-017-1636-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crystals exfoliate in solvents like N-Cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) in a time of just some minutes resulting in a high-yield production of its few-layers resulting in increase of its indirect bandgap from 0.9 eV to 1.3 eV. As an application in electronics, its field-effect transistors has been realised using its few layers as a conducting channel material offering a high current modulation ratio larger than 10000 at room temperature. Therefore, group IVB TMDs also holds potential applications in the field of opto-electronics.

===MXenes===

[[MXenes]] are layered transition metal carbides and carbonitrides with general formula of M&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, where M stands for early transition metal, X stands for carbon and/or nitrogen and T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; stands for surface terminations (mostly =O, -OH or -F). MXenes have high electric conductivity (10000-1500 Scm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) combined with hydrophilic surfaces that can be tuned with solvents. This materials show promise in energy storage applications and composites. They are synthesized from ceramic precursor MAX phases by removing the single atomic layer "A" where M stands for Ti, Mo, W, Nb, Zr, Hf, V, Cr, Ta, Sc, A stands for Al, Si, and X stands for C, N. Millions of predicted solid solutions of these materials have been identified and 30+ MXenes have been synthesized.

== Organic ==
Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an organic, crystalline, structurally tunable electrical conductor with a high surface area. HITP is an organic chemical (2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamino[[triphenylene]]). It shares graphene's [[hexagonal]] [[honeycomb]] structure. Multiple layers naturally form perfectly aligned stacks, with identical 2-nm openings at the centers of the hexagons. Room temperature electrical conductivity is ~40&amp;nbsp;[[Siemens (unit)|S]]&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, comparable to that of bulk graphite and among the highest for any conducting [[metal-organic framework]]s (MOFs). The temperature dependence of its conductivity is linear at temperatures between 100&amp;nbsp;K and 500&amp;nbsp;K, suggesting an unusual charge transport mechanism that has not been previously observed in organic semiconductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = High Electrical Conductivity in Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a Semiconducting Metal–Organic Graphene Analogue|doi = 10.1021/ja502765n|journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]|year = 2014|pages = 8859–8862|volume = 136|issue = 25|pmid = 24750124|first1 = Dennis|last1 = Sheberla|first2 = Lei|last2 = Sun|first3 = Martin A.|last3 = Blood-Forsythe|first4 = Süleyman|last4 = Er|first5 = Casey R.|last5 = Wade|first6 = Carl K.|last6 = Brozek|first7 = Alán|last7 = Aspuru-Guzik|first8 = Mircea|last8 = Dincă|url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:23597721|format = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material was claimed to be the first of a group formed by switching metals and/or organic compounds. The material can be isolated as a powder or a film with conductivity values of 2 and 40&amp;nbsp;S&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/a-new-self-assembling-graphene-like-material-for-flat-semiconductors |title=A new self-assembling graphene-like material for flat semiconductors |publisher=KurzweilAI |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combinations==
A 2015 study stacked two different TMD layers onto graphene. This composite displayed negative differential resistance – applying more voltage to the device reduced the current flowing through it.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A recent study combined graphene and hexagonal boron nitride to form a planar two-dimensional material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nandwana|first1=Dinkar|last2=Ertekin|first2=Elif|title=Ripples, Strain, and Misfit Dislocations: Structure of Graphene–Boron Nitride Superlattice Interfaces|journal=Nano Letters|date=11 March 2015|volume=15|issue=3|pages=1468–1475|doi=10.1021/nl505005t|pmid=25647719|bibcode=2015NanoL..15.1468N}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combination displayed variety of structural formations that potentially varies the electrical, thermal and optical properties.

As of 2014, none of these materials has been used for large scale commercial applications (with the possible exception of graphene). Despite this, many are under close consideration for a number of industries, in areas including electronics and optoelectronics, sensors, [[biological engineering]], [[filtration]], lightweight/strong [[composite materials]], [[photovoltaic]]s, medicine, [[quantum dots]], thermal management, ethanol distillation and [[energy storage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graphenea.com/pages/graphene-uses-applications |title=Graphene Uses &amp; Applications |publisher=Graphenea |date= |accessdate=2014-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Physical unclonable function|cryptography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=cao|first=yameng|last2=Robson|first2=Alexander J.|last3=Alharbi|first3=Abdullah|last4=Roberts|first4=Jonathan|last5=Woodhead|first5=Christopher Stephen|last6=Noori|first6=Yasir Jamal|last7=Gavito|first7=Ramon Bernardo|last8=Shahrjerdi|first8=Davood|last9=Roedig|first9=Utz|date=2017|title=Optical identification using imperfections in 2D materials|journal=2D Materials|volume=4|issue=4|pages=045021|language=en|doi=10.1088/2053-1583/aa8b4d|issn=2053-1583|arxiv=1706.07949|bibcode=2017TDM.....4d5021C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have enormous potential.

Graphene has been the most studied. In small quantities it is available as a powder and as a dispersion in a polymer matrix, or adhesive, elastomer, oil and aqueous and non-aqueous solutions. The dispersion is claimed to be suitable for advanced composites, paints and coatings, lubricants, oils and functional fluids, capacitors and batteries, thermal management applications, display materials and packaging, inks and 3D-printers’ materials, and barriers and films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedgraphenematerials.com/products/graphene-dispersions/|title=Applied Graphene Materials plc :: Graphene dispersions|website=appliedgraphenematerials.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Guohua|last2=Kang|first2=Joohoon|last3=Ng|first3=Leonard W.

===Biological applications===
Research on 2D nanomaterials is still in its infancy, with the majority of research focusing on elucidating the unique material [[wikt:trait|characteristics]] and few reports focusing on [[biomedical]] applications of 2D [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerativitayanan|first1=P|last2=Carrow|first2=JK|last3=Gaharwar|first3=AK|title=Nanomaterials for Engineering Stem Cell Responses|journal=Advanced Healthcare Materials|date=26 May 2015|doi=10.1002/adhm.201500272|pmid=26010739|volume=4|issue=11|pages=1600–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, recent rapid advances in 2D nanomaterials have raised important yet exciting questions about their interactions with [[biological]] moieties. 2D nanoparticles such as carbon-based 2D materials, silicate clays, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and transition metal oxides (TMOs) provide enhanced physical, chemical, and biological functionality owing to their uniform shapes, high surface-to-volume ratios, and surface charge.

'''Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials''' are ultrathin [[nanomaterials]] with a high degree of [[anisotropy]] and [[chemical]] functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=X|last2=Tan|first2=C|last3=Yin|first3=Z|last4=Zhang|first4=H|title=25th anniversary article: hybrid nanostructures based on two-dimensional nanomaterials|journal=Advanced Materials &amp; Processes|date=9 April 2014|volume=26|issue=14|pages=2185–204|pmid=24615947|doi=10.1002/adma.201304964}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2D nanomaterials are highly diverse in terms of their [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[chemical]], and [[optical]] properties, as well as in size, shape, biocompatibility, and degradability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrow|first1=James K.|last2=Gaharwar|first2=Akhilesh K.|title=Bioinspired Polymeric Nanocomposites for Regenerative Medicine|journal=Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics|date=February 2015|volume=216|issue=3|pages=248–264|doi=10.1002/macp.201400427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nandwana|first1=Dinkar|last2=Ertekin|first2=Elif|title=Lattice mismatch induced ripples and wrinkles in planar graphene/boron nitride superlattices|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=21 June 2015|volume=117|issue=234304|pages=234304|doi=10.1063/1.4922504|arxiv=1504.02929|bibcode=2015JAP...117w4304N}}&lt;/ref&gt; These diverse properties make 2D nanomaterials suitable for a wide range of applications, including [[drug delivery]], [[Medical imaging|imaging]], [[tissue engineering]], and [[biosensors]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaharwar|first1=AK|last2=Peppas|first2=NA|last3=Khademhosseini|first3=A|title=Nanocomposite hydrogels for biomedical applications|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|date=March 2014|volume=111|issue=3|pages=441–53|pmid=24264728|doi=10.1002/bit.25160|pmc=3924876}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their low-dimension nanostructure gives them some common characteristics. For example, 2D nanomaterials are the thinnest materials known, which means that they also possess the highest specific surface areas of all known materials. This characteristic makes these materials invaluable for applications requiring high levels of surface interactions on a small scale. As a result, 2D nanomaterials are being explored for use in [[drug delivery]] systems, where they can adsorb large numbers of drug molecules and enable superior control over release kinetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goenka|first1=S|last2=Sant|first2=V|last3=Sant|first3=S|title=Graphene-based nanomaterials for drug delivery and tissue engineering|journal=Journal of Controlled Release|date=10 January 2014|volume=173|pages=75–88|pmid=24161530|doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, their exceptional surface area to volume ratios and typically high modulus values make them useful for improving the [[mechanical properties]] of biomedical [[nanocomposites]] and [[nanocomposite hydrogels]], even at low concentrations. Their extreme thinness has been instrumental for breakthroughs in [[biosensing]] and [[Full genome sequencing|gene sequencing]]. Moreover, the thinness of these molecules allows them to respond rapidly to external signals such as light, which has led to utility in optical therapies of all kinds, including imaging applications, [[photothermal therapy]] (PTT), and [[photodynamic therapy]] (PDT).

Despite the rapid pace of development in the field of 2D nanomaterials, these materials must be carefully evaluated for [[biocompatibility]] in order to be relevant for [[biomedical]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaharwar|first1=A.K.|title=Nanomaterials in tissue engineering : fabrication and applications|date=2013|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-85709-596-1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newness of this class of materials means that even the relatively well-established 2D materials like [[graphene]] are poorly understood in terms of their physiological interactions with living [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s. Additionally, the complexities of variable particle size and shape, impurities from manufacturing, and [[protein]] and [[immune]] interactions have resulted in a patchwork of knowledge on the biocompatibility of these materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21118">Proposals for the creation of a '''United Nations Environmental Organization''' ('''UNEO''') have come as some question the efficacy of the current [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP) at dealing with the scope of global environmental issues.  Created to act as an anchor institution in the system of [https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144932/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article46&amp;lang=en Global Environmental Governance] (GEG), it has failed to meet those demands.  The UNEP has been hindered by its title as a Programme as opposed to a [[Specialized agency]] like the [[WTO]] or [[WHO]], in addition to a lack of voluntary funding, and a location removed from the centers of political power, in [[Nairobi]], Kenya.  These factors have led to widespread calls for UNEP reform, and following the publication of [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] in February 2007, a "Paris Call for Action" read out by French President [[Chirac]] and supported by 46 countries, called for the UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful United Nations Environment Organization, to be modelled on the [[World Health Organization]]. The 52 countries included the [[European Union]] nations, but notably did not include the [[United States]] and [[BRIC]] ([[Brasil]], [[Russia]], [[India]], and [[China]]), the top five emitters of [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL03357553._CH_.2400 |title=46 nations call for tougher U.N. environment role|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-02-03|first=Alister|last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNEP Limiting Factors ==
A number of factors have limited the UNEP's ability to fulfill its mandate.

=== Designation as a Programme ===
The decision to establish the UNEP as a program as opposed to a Specialized Agency like the [[WHO]] has had enormous implications for UNEP's performance. “In the UN hierarchy, Programmes have the least independence and authority,” and this has made it difficult for UNEP to establish authority over subsequent UN bodies dealing with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/gegproject/uneo-wp.pdf Assessing UNEP as Anchor Institution for the Global Environment: Lessons for the UNEO Debate]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, “born out of a General Assembly Resolution, its mandate was limited and deprived of any implementing powers”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3970/is_200207/ai_n9090123/pg_9?tag=artBody;col1 UNEP: Retrospect and prospect--options for reforming the Global Environmental Governance Regime]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location ===
The UNEP has been handicapped by its location in Nairobi, Kenya.  The first UN body headquartered in the [[Global South]], the move was meant to ease tensions between the developed and developing world.  However, its location in Kenya has led to an isolation from other international environmental power structures, as well as a “physical fragmentation of the governance structure” due to its removal from other UN bodies headquartered in [[Geneva]] and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3970/is_200207/ai_n9090123/pg_9?tag=artBody;col1 UNEP: Retrospect and prospect--options for reforming the Global Environmental Governance Regime]&lt;/ref&gt;  UNEP's headquarters in Nairobi also make it difficult to attract the top-notch staff which are needed to effectively run the Programme.  This is due to an uncertain security situation in Kenya and quality of life issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/gegproject/uneo-wp.pdf Assessing UNEP as Anchor Institution for the Global Environment: Lessons for the UNEO Debate]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
Many of UNEP's struggles can be traced back to a lack of funding, and that lack of funding can be traced back to the UNEP's unique funding system.  Unlike other international organizations, the UNEP does not have mandatory assessments, but instead is reliant on the voluntary contributions of UN member states.  “UNEP’s unreliable and highly discretionary financial arrangement compromises the financial stability of the organization, its ability to plan beyond the current budget cycle, and its autonomy” as well as making the UNEP too dependent on certain member states which then hold undue influence in UNEP agenda setting.  Voluntary contributions to the [[Environment Fund]] have decreased by 36% over the past ten years and have been displaced by restricted and earmarked contributions which now make up 2/3 of the UNEP's budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/gegproject/uneo-wp.pdf Assessing UNEP as Anchor Institution for the Global Environment: Lessons for the UNEO Debate]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNEP's Failure as an Anchor Institution ==
The UNEP was created to perform the tasks of an anchor institution in the system of Global Environmental Governance (GEG).  According to the Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of the United Nations Environmental program, “the role of UNEP was to be the leading global environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda, promotes the coherent implementation of the Environmental dimension of sustainable development within the UN system, and serves as an authoritative advocate for the global environment”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/inter-linkages/docs/IEG/Tarasofsky.pdf International Environmental Governance: Strengthening UNEP]&lt;/ref&gt;  Maria Ivanova, Director of the Global Environmental Governance Project at the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy, writes in a working paper entitled Assessing UNEP as Anchor Institution for the Global Environment: Lessons for the UNEO Debate that “anchor institutions are the primary, though not the only, international organizations in certain global issue areas and typically perform three core functions: 1) overseeing monitoring, assessment, and reporting on the state of the issue in their purview; 2) setting an agenda for action and advancing standards, policies, and guidelines; and 3) developing institutional capacity to address existing and emerging problems.”  However, while the UNEP was chartered to perform these three primary tasks, it has failed in many ways:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/gegproject/uneo-wp.pdf Assessing UNEP as Anchor Institution for the Global Environment: Lessons for the UNEO Debate]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monitoring, assessment and reporting ===
The UNEP has had the most success in the areas of monitoring, assessment, and reporting; it is thought{{by whom?|date=February 2016}} to do relatively well in the arena of global environmental assessment (GEA), and publishes the [[Global Environment Outlook]] (GEO) reports. However, it fails to analyze environmental issues at the state level, and responsibility for monitoring, assessment, and reporting is allocated to all eight divisions of UNEP, creating redundancies.  Additionally, the UNEP system of reporting is disorganized and difficult to access.  "The public cannot use UNEP's publications and benefit from the organization's work to the fullest due to the lack of a single easily accessible, searchable, and sortable database or catalog of publications".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.yale.edu/gegproject/uneo-wp.pdf Assessing UNEP as Anchor Institution for the Global Environment: Lessons for the UNEO Debate]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agenda Setting ===
“Another important function critical to the effectiveness of an anchor institution is agenda setting and management of intergovernmental processes to gain agreement on standards, policies, and guidelines or even just serving as the central forum for deliberation and debate.”  While UNEP has had considerable success in the creation of treaties and multilateral environmental agreements (the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the Montreal Protocol on the Protection of the Ozone Layer, etc.), it has struggled to coordinate the efforts of the numerous international environmental regulatory bodies after their inception.  “UNEP has not succeeded in becoming the central forum for debate and deliberation in the environmental field, like the WTO for trade or the WHO for health.”  This lack of a central coordinating authority has led to an erosion in the efficacy of Global Environmental Governance.  “UNEP has not been able to fulfill its coordination mandate effectively in its two key areas of responsibility (1) coordination of multilateral environmental agreements and (2) coordination of the environmental activities of other international organizations”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/gegproject/uneo-wp.pdf Assessing UNEP as Anchor Institution for the Global Environment: Lessons for the UNEO Debate]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capacity Development ===
The UNEP has struggled to establish its role in the International system and this has led to it also having difficulty in Capacity Development (defined by Ivanova as Education and Training, Financing, Technical Assistance, and Institution and Network Building).  The UNEP mandate calls for the UNEP to play a primarily normative role in GEG, however “the organization now views implementation as its primary strategy.”  This shift has been necessitated by a desire from states for less treaties and more concrete action and the need for the UNEP to provide tangible results for potential governmental and private sources of funding, upon which the UNEP is dependent.  However, in moving away from a normative role, the UNEP has moved away from its strengths: “information provision, development of common norms and principles, and institutional capacity development”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/gegproject/uneo-wp.pdf Assessing UNEP as Anchor Institution for the Global Environment: Lessons for the UNEO Debate]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation of a United Nations Environmental Organization ==
After the 58th meeting of the UN General Assembly, a proposal was made by the member states of the European Union to transform the UNEP into the United Nations Environmental Organization.  In 2007 at UNEP's Governing Council meeting, the EU repeated its call for a ““a significant strengthening of UNEP, along the lines sketched out in Cartagena as well as in the recent announcements of the Executive Director, which will help UNEP to become more effective in catalyzing action to address major environmental threats” and “that an upgrade of UNEP into a UNEO, with stable, adequate and predictable resources and with the appropriate international standing, would enable the organization to fully fulfill its mandate and to live up to the expectations of developed and developing countries”.  Proponents of a UNEO argue that it would play a vital role in increasing the political importance of environmental issues in the UN, and could therefore play a vital role in solving the many environmental challenges the earth currently faces.  Specifics of a UNEO would need to be worked out by the international community, but certain basic aspects of a UNEO would likely include&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081013071524/http://www.centerforunreform.org/system/files/GEG_Meyer-Ohlendorf_Knigge.pdf A United Nations Environment Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specialized Agency Status ===
While still working within the UN system and reporting to ECOSOC, designation as a specialized agency would allow UNEO to “enjoy budgetary autonomy” and  “determine most details of their programming.”  Additionally, creation of a UNEO would not require consensus among the members of the UN, and “membership in a UNEO and the UN could differ”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081013071524/http://www.centerforunreform.org/system/files/GEG_Meyer-Ohlendorf_Knigge.pdf A United Nations Environment Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNEO Structure ===
As with other Specialized Agencies, the institutional structure of a UNEO would consist of a plenary body, an executive organ, and a secretariat.  Proponents of a UNEO suggest that a UNEO plenary body would “elect the members of the executive organ, appoint the Director General and approve the budget and work programme.”  The plenary body would also likely include a wide range of observers from other international organizations to non-governmental organizations and representatives of civil society.  Specialized agencies have an executive organ which ensures that the agency achieves its operational goals and manages the budget.  A UNEO executive organ is likely to “prepare the budget and work programme of the UNEO.”  The Secretariat would “as the focal point for all the agency’s activities,” however there is considerable variety in the organization of the Secretariats of various Specialized Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081013071524/http://www.centerforunreform.org/system/files/GEG_Meyer-Ohlendorf_Knigge.pdf A United Nations Environment Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNEO Purpose and Tasks ===
The exact mandate and function of a UNEO would be determined by the states involved, but they are likely to be similar to those of the UNEP.  “It has been argued that a UNEO should help to systematically pool the scientific knowledge on environmental issues and help to define global environmental strategic guidelines to promote coordination and synergies.”  However, unlike other specialized agencies like the WTO, it would not have the power to adjudicate environmental disputes.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.centerforunreform.org/system/files/GEG_Meyer-Ohlendorf_Knigge.pdf A United Nations Environment Organization] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309152337/https://www.centerforunreform.org/system/files/GEG_Meyer-Ohlendorf_Knigge.pdf |date=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents suggest that a UNEO could serve as an umbrella organization, helping to coordinate the “over 500 multilateral environment agreements (MEA) and numerous international organizations and fora dealing in an uncoordinated way with the environment” and make them more efficient and less redundant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Bernard-Kouchner-on-UN-environment.html Global Compact – International environmental governance and the United Nations Environment Organization (UNEO) project – Speech by M. Bernard Kouchner, Minister of Foreign and European Affairs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030153530/http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Bernard-Kouchner-on-UN-environment.html |date=October 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNEO Funding ===
A UNEO would likely rely on assessed contributions, which would alleviate UNEP problems that stem from a reliance on voluntary contributions.  As a specialized agency, a UNEO would be able to determine the assessment scales of members separately from the UN general budget.  Voluntary contributions would likely be used for specific projects, but assessed contributions would pay for the operating budget of a UNEO.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081013071524/http://www.centerforunreform.org/system/files/GEG_Meyer-Ohlendorf_Knigge.pdf A United Nations Environment Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
While the number of countries who favor the creation of a UNEO has grown, there remain fears among many states that the creation of a UNEO would “favor environmental policies to the detriment of other policies, notably economic development and, thus, poverty eradication.”  Some states also feel that the UNEP should first be strengthened and given time to improve international environmental governance before a UNEO is created.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081013071524/http://www.centerforunreform.org/system/files/GEG_Meyer-Ohlendorf_Knigge.pdf A United Nations Environment Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prospects ===
There is a consensus among policy-makers that UNEP needs to be strengthened, and “in November 2006, the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on UN System-wide Coherence in the Areas of Development, Humanitarian Assistance, and the Environment recommended that 'UNEP should be upgraded and have real authority as the environmental policy pillar of the UN system'”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081013071524/http://www.centerforunreform.org/system/files/GEG_Meyer-Ohlendorf_Knigge.pdf A United Nations Environment Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;  And while disagreement remains over whether the creation of a UNEO is necessary, according to a French embassy statement, support is growing.  “Following the Paris Call for Action, the Group of Friends of the UNEO was set up and now has 52 States, bringing together, besides the European Union, countries from every geographical area",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Bernard-Kouchner-on-UN-environment.html Global Compact – International environmental governance and the United Nations Environment Organization (UNEO) project – Speech by M.

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}

The '''velocity''' of an object is the [[Time derivative|rate of change]] of its [[Position (vector)|position]] with respect to a [[frame of reference]], and is a function of time. Velocity is equivalent to a specification of an object's [[speed]] and direction of [[motion (physics)|motion]] (e.g. {{val|60|u=[[Kilometres per hour|km/h]]}} to the north).  Velocity is a fundamental concept in [[kinematics]], the branch of [[classical mechanics]] that describes the motion of bodies.

Velocity is a physical [[vector (geometry)|vector]] [[Physical quantity|quantity]]; both magnitude and direction are needed to define it. The [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] [[absolute value]] ([[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]) of velocity is called {{em|speed}}, being a coherent derived unit whose quantity is measured in the [[International System of Units|SI]] ([[metric system]]) as [[metres per second]] (m/s) or as the SI base unit of (m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). For example, "5 metres per second" is a scalar, whereas "5 metres per second east" is a vector. 
If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an ''[[acceleration]]''.

==Constant velocity vs acceleration==
To have a '''constant velocity''', an object must have a constant speed in a constant direction.  Constant direction constrains the object to motion in a straight path thus, a constant velocity means motion in a straight line at a constant speed.
 &lt;!-- Could discuss the basic equations of motion of a body moving at constant velocity here. --&gt;

For example, a car moving at a constant 20 kilometres per hour in a circular path has a constant speed, but does not have a constant velocity because its direction changes. Hence, the car is considered to be undergoing an acceleration.

==Distinction between speed and velocity==
[[File:Kinematics.svg|thumb|300px|Kinematic quantities of a classical particle: mass ''m'', position '''r''', velocity '''v''', acceleration '''a'''.]]
[[Speed]] describes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity gives both how fast it is and in which direction the object is moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edwin Bidwell|title=Vector analysis: a text-book for the use of students of mathematics and physics, founded upon the lectures of J. Willard Gibbs|year=1901|pages=125|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015000962285?urlappend=%3Bseq=149}} This is the likely origin of the speed/velocity terminology in vector physics.&lt;/ref&gt; If a car is said to travel at 60&amp;nbsp;km/h, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60&amp;nbsp;km/h to the north, its velocity has now been specified.

The big difference can be noticed when we consider movement around a circle. When something moves in a circular path (at a constant speed, see above) and returns to its starting point, its average velocity is zero but its average [[speed]] is found by dividing the [[circumference]] of the [[circle]] by the time taken to move around the [[circle]]. This is because the average velocity is calculated by only considering the [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] between the starting and the end points while the average speed considers only the total [[distance]] traveled.

==Equation of motion==
{{main|Equation of motion}}

===Average velocity===
Velocity is defined as the rate of change of position with respect to time, which may also be referred to as the ''instantaneous velocity'' to emphasize the distinction from the average velocity. In some applications the "average velocity" of an object might be needed, that is to say, the constant velocity that would provide the same resultant displacement as a variable velocity in the same time interval, {{math|'''v'''(''t'')}}, over some time period {{math|Δ''t''}}. Average velocity can be calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\bar{v}} = \frac{\Delta\boldsymbol{x}}{\Delta\mathit{t}} .&lt;/math&gt;

The average velocity is always less than or equal to the average speed of an object. This can be seen by realizing that while distance is always strictly increasing, displacement can increase or decrease in magnitude as well as change direction.

In terms of a displacement-time (''x'' vs. ''t'') graph, the instantaneous velocity (or, simply, velocity) can be thought of as the [[Derivative|slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point]], and the average velocity as the slope of the [[secant line]] between two points with ''t'' coordinates equal to the boundaries of the time period for the average velocity.

The average velocity is the same as the velocity averaged over time – that is to say, its time-weighted average, which may be calculated as the time integral of the velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\bar{v}} = {1 \over t_1 - t_0 } \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \boldsymbol{v}(t) \ dt ,&lt;/math&gt;

where we may identify

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \boldsymbol{x} = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \boldsymbol{v}(t) \ dt &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta t = t_1 - t_0 .&lt;/math&gt;

===Instantaneous velocity===
[[File:Velocity vs time graph.svg|thumb|266px|Example of a velocity vs. time graph, and the relationship between velocity '''''v''''' on the y-axis, acceleration '''''a''''' (the three green [[tangent]] lines represent the values for acceleration at different points along the curve) and displacement '''''s''''' (the yellow [[area]] under the curve.)]]
If we consider {{math|'''''v'''''}} as velocity and {{math|'''''x'''''}} as the displacement (change in position) vector, then we can express the (instantaneous) velocity of a particle or object, at any particular time {{math|''t''}}, as the [[derivative]] of the position with respect to time:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v} = \lim_{{\Delta t}\to 0} \frac{\Delta \boldsymbol{x}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\boldsymbol{x}}{d\mathit{t}} .&lt;/math&gt;

From this derivative equation, in the one-dimensional case it can be seen that the area under a velocity vs. time ({{math|'''''v'''''}} vs. {{math|''t''}} graph) is the displacement, {{math|'''''x'''''}}. In calculus terms, the [[integral]] of the velocity function {{math|'''''v'''''(''t'')}} is the displacement function {{math|'''''x'''''(''t'')}}. In the figure, this corresponds to the yellow area under the curve labeled {{math|'''''s'''''}} ({{math|'''''s'''''}} being an alternative notation for displacement).

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x} =  \int \boldsymbol{v} \  d\mathit{t} .&lt;/math&gt;

Since the derivative of the position with respect to time gives the change in position (in [[metre]]s) divided by the change in time (in [[second]]s), velocity is measured in [[metre per second|metres per second]] (m/s). Although the concept of an instantaneous velocity might at first seem counter-intuitive, it may be thought of as the velocity that the object would continue to travel at if it stopped accelerating at that moment.

===Relationship to acceleration===

Although velocity is defined as the rate of change of position, it is often common to start with an expression for an object's [[acceleration]]. As seen by the three green tangent lines in the figure, an object's instantaneous acceleration at a point in time is the [[slope]] of the [[Tangent|line tangent]] to the curve of a {{math|'''''v'''''(''t'')}} graph at that point. In other words, acceleration is defined as the derivative of velocity with respect to time:

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{a} = \frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{d\mathit{t}} .&lt;/math&gt;

From there, we can obtain an expression for velocity as the area under an {{math|'''''a'''''(''t'')}} acceleration vs. time graph. As above, this is done using the concept of the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v} = \int \boldsymbol{a} \  d\mathit{t} .&lt;/math&gt;

====Constant acceleration====
In the special case of constant acceleration, velocity can be studied using the [[Equations of motion|suvat equations]]. By considering '''a''' as being equal to some arbitrary constant vector, it is trivial to show that
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v} = \boldsymbol{u} + \boldsymbol{a}t&lt;/math&gt;
with {{math|'''''v'''''}} as the velocity at time {{math|''t''}} and {{math|'''''u'''''}} as the velocity at time {{math|1=''t'' = 0}}. By combining this equation with the suvat equation {{math|1='''''x''''' = '''''u'''t'' + '''''a'''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2}}, it is possible to relate the displacement and the average velocity by
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x} = \frac{(\boldsymbol{u} + \boldsymbol{v})}{2}\mathit{t} = \boldsymbol{\bar{v}}\mathit{t}&lt;/math&gt;.
It is also possible to derive an expression for the velocity independent of time, known as the [[Torricelli equation]], as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;v^{2} = \boldsymbol{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{v} = (\boldsymbol{u}+\boldsymbol{a}t)\cdot(\boldsymbol{u}+\boldsymbol{a}t)=u^{2}+2t(\boldsymbol{a}\cdot\boldsymbol{u})+a^{2}t^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(2\boldsymbol{a})\cdot\boldsymbol{x} = (2\boldsymbol{a})\cdot(\boldsymbol{u}t+\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{a}t^{2})=2t(\boldsymbol{a}\cdot\boldsymbol{u})+a^{2}t^{2} = v^{2} - u^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\therefore v^{2} = u^{2} + 2(\boldsymbol{a}\cdot\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|1=''v'' = {{abs|'''''v'''''}}}} etc.

The above equations are valid for both [[Newtonian mechanics]] and [[special relativity]]. Where Newtonian mechanics and special relativity differ is in how different observers would describe the same situation. In particular, in Newtonian mechanics, all observers agree on the value of t and the transformation rules for position create a situation in which all non-accelerating observers would describe the acceleration of an object with the same values. Neither is true for special relativity. In other words, only relative velocity can be calculated.

===Quantities that are dependent on velocity===
The [[kinetic energy]] of a moving object is dependent on its velocity and is given by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\text{k}} = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
ignoring [[special relativity]], where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is the kinetic energy and ''m'' is the mass. Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity as it depends on the square of the velocity, however a related quantity, [[momentum]], is a vector and defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{p}=m\boldsymbol{v}&lt;/math&gt;
In [[special relativity]], the dimensionless [[Lorentz factor]] appears frequently, and is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}&lt;/math&gt;
where γ is the Lorentz factor and ''c'' is the speed of light.

[[Escape velocity]] is the minimum speed a ballistic object needs to escape from a massive body such as Earth. It represents the kinetic energy that, when added to the object's gravitational potential energy, (which is always negative) is equal to zero. The general formula for the escape velocity of an object at a distance ''r'' from the center of a planet with mass ''M'' is
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{e}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}} = \sqrt{2gr},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''G'' is the [[Gravitational constant]] and ''g'' is the [[Gravitational acceleration]]. The escape velocity from Earth's surface is about 11 200&amp;nbsp;m/s, and is irrespective of the direction of the object. This makes "escape velocity" somewhat of a misnomer, as the more correct term would be "escape speed": any object attaining a velocity of that magnitude, irrespective of atmosphere, will leave the vicinity of the base body as long as it doesn't intersect with something in its path.

==Relative velocity==

{{main|Relative velocity}}
'''Relative velocity''' is a measurement of velocity between two objects
as determined in a single coordinate system. Relative velocity is fundamental in both classical and modern physics, since many systems in physics deal with the relative motion of two or more particles. In Newtonian mechanics, the relative velocity is independent of the chosen inertial reference frame. This is not the case anymore with [[special relativity]] in which velocities depend on the choice of reference frame.

If an object A is moving with velocity [[vector (geometry)|vector]] '''''v''''' and an object B with velocity vector '''''w''''', then the velocity of object A ''relative to'' object B is defined as the difference of the two velocity vectors:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}_{A\text{ relative to }B} = \boldsymbol{v} - \boldsymbol{w}&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly the relative velocity of object B moving with velocity '''''w''''', relative to object A moving with velocity '''''v''''' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}_{B\text{ relative to }A} = \boldsymbol{w} - \boldsymbol{v}&lt;/math&gt;
Usually the inertial frame is chosen in which the latter of the two mentioned objects is in rest.

===Scalar velocities===
In the one-dimensional case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saburchill.com/physics/chapters/0083.html Basic principle]&lt;/ref&gt; the velocities are scalars and the equation is either:
:&lt;math&gt;\, v_{rel} = v - (-w)&lt;/math&gt;, if the two objects are moving in opposite directions, or:
:&lt;math&gt;\, v_{rel} = v -(+w)&lt;/math&gt;, if the two objects are moving in the same direction.

==Polar coordinates==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Doppler effect]] --&gt;
In [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], a two-dimensional velocity is described by a [[radial velocity]], defined as the component of velocity away from or toward the origin (also known as ''velocity made good''), and an [[angular velocity]], which is the rate of rotation about the origin (with positive quantities representing counter-clockwise rotation and negative quantities representing clockwise rotation, in a right-handed coordinate system).

The radial and angular velocities can be derived from the Cartesian velocity and displacement vectors by decomposing the velocity vector into radial and transverse components. The [[Transversality (mathematics)|transverse]] velocity is the component of velocity along a circle centered at the origin.

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}=\boldsymbol{v}_T+\boldsymbol{v}_R&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}_T&lt;/math&gt; is the transverse velocity
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}_R&lt;/math&gt; is the radial velocity.
The ''magnitude of the radial velocity'' is the [[dot product]] of the velocity vector and the unit vector in the direction of the displacement.
:&lt;math&gt;v_R=\frac{\boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{r}}{\left|\boldsymbol{r}\right|}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r}&lt;/math&gt; is displacement.
The ''magnitude of the transverse velocity'' is that of the [[cross product]] of the unit vector in the direction of the displacement and the velocity vector. It is also the product of the [[angular speed]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and the magnitude of the displacement.
:&lt;math&gt;v_T=\frac{|\boldsymbol{r}\times\boldsymbol{v}|}{|\boldsymbol{r}|}=\omega|\boldsymbol{r}|&lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{|\boldsymbol{r}\times\boldsymbol{v}|}{|\boldsymbol{r}|^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Angular momentum]] in scalar form is the mass times the distance to the origin times the transverse velocity, or equivalently, the mass times the distance squared times the angular speed. The sign convention for angular momentum is the same as that for angular velocity.
:&lt;math&gt;L=mrv_T=mr^2\omega\,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; is mass
:&lt;math&gt;r=\|\boldsymbol{r}\|.&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;mr^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as [[moment of inertia]].
If forces are in the radial direction only with an inverse square dependence, as in the case of a gravitational [[orbit]], angular momentum is constant, and transverse speed is inversely proportional to the distance, angular speed is inversely proportional to the distance squared, and the rate at which area is swept out is constant.  These relations are known as [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].

'''Workhorse Group Incorporated''' is an American manufacturing company based in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, currently focused on manufacturing electrically powered delivery and utility vehicles. 

The company was founded in 1998 by investors who took over the production of General Motors' P30/P32 series stepvan and motorhome chassis.&lt;ref name=rvbiz1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Navistar Closing Down Workhorse to Cut Costs|journal=RV Business|date=2012-08-12|archivedate=2013-11-05|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105210647/http://www.rvbusiness.com/2012/09/navistar-closing-down-workhorse-to-cut-costs/ | url = http://www.rvbusiness.com/2012/09/navistar-closing-down-workhorse-to-cut-costs/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 they were taken over by [[Navistar International]], which had been selling them diesel engines since before.&lt;ref name=norv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truckinginfo.com/news/story/2013/05/navistar-sells-recreational-vehicle-business.aspx |title=Navistar sells RV Business, drops eStar Van as Part of its Turnaround Plan|author=Billings, Randy |date=2013-05-16 |website=News |publisher=Trucking Info |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navistar then shuttered the plant in 2012, to cut costs after having suffered heavy losses.&lt;ref name=rvbiz1/&gt; 

In March 2015 [[AMP Electric Vehicles]] took over Workhorse Custom Chassis, changing the company name to Workhorse Group Incorporated, and began offering a range of electrically powered delivery vans.

[[File:King County Metro Workhorse van 1913.jpg|thumb|A Workhorse LF72 bus chassis with Startrans President LF (low-floor) bodywork]]
As of 2016, the company offers the familiar W62 chassis and a newer, narrow-tracked version called the W88. Their first product was the P-series, based on the Chevrolet/GMC P30-series stepvan/mobile home chassis. An earlier version was the W42 chassis, and they were also managerially involved with the construction of Navistar's [[Navistar International#estar|eStar electric van]], until it too was cancelled in early 2013.&lt;ref name=norv/&gt; Workhorse also briefly offered an integrated chassis/body model called the MetroStar, hearkening back to the long-lived [[International Harvester Metro Van]] line.

There were also the low-floor bus chassis (LF72), as well as a rear-engined recreational vehicle chassis called the UFO.

==Pickup truck==
In November 2016, Workhorse announced that they were working on an electrically powered pickup truck, called the W-15. North Carolina's [[Duke Energy]] has stated that it will buy 500 of the vehicles, and the city of [[Orlando]] is also interested.&lt;ref name=hsu1&gt;{{cite web | title = Workhorse Group to Make Electric Pickup Trucks | url = https://www.trucks.com/2016/11/07/workhorse-group-electric-pickup-trucks/ | work = Trucks.com | last = Hsu | first = Tiffany | date = 2016-11-07 | accessdate = 2016-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is scheduled to have 460 horsepower and a battery range of 80 miles. A gasoline range extender supplies further range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/workhorse-unveils-pictures-specs-of-w-15-electric-work-pickup/ |title=Workhorse unveils pictures, specs of W-15 electric work pickup |publisher=Roadshow |accessdate= 2017-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
