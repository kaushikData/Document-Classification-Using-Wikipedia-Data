{{Politics of Burundi}}
The '''Abahuza''' party is a [[monarchism|monarchist]] [[political party]] in [[Burundi]].  Officially called the '''Party for the Restoration of Monarchy and Dialogue in Burundi''', Abahuza literally means “The Reconciliators” in the [[Kirundi]] language.  The party was  registered with Burundi’s Interior Ministry on September 20, 2004.  Since then, the party has achieved wide national and international attention.

The party was led by [[Prince Godefroid Kamatari]], one of the heirs to the Burundian throne until his death on the 20 August 2005. The main goal of the Abahuza party is the restoration of Burundi’s monarchy, which was abolished in 1966, which it asserts resulted in violent ethno-national conflict between the [[Tutsis]] and the [[Hutus]]. The ethno-national cleavage in Burundi mirrors that in neighboring [[Rwanda]] to the north.  During that time, many members of the Tutsi royal family were assassinated by Hutu nationalists, and civil wars have ravaged the small country ever since.  According to Abahuza party leaders, a return to monarchy will put an end to the unrest.  Prince Godefroid was able to communicate the central ideology of the Abahuza party in his statement that "the monarchy lasted 500 years in Burundi in a political environment of stability and cohabitation because the King was the symbol of national unity."

Prince Godefroid had stated that the Abahuza party sought a [[constitutional monarchy]], like those seen in Europe, as opposed to a totalitarian monarchy.  The party chose [[Princess]] [[Esther Kamatari]], Godefroid’s sister and a former fashion model in Paris, to run as their presidential candidate in the elections coming up in April.  Their hope is to end the ethnic divisions in the country and restore peace and harmony.  In addition, the party hopes to reestablish the monarchy through a referendum that would be voted on.  According to Princess Kamatari, her first step as president would be to implement a social plan “because the country is in ruins.”  This ideology targets the poor and non-intellectual populations in Burundi.  The party’s decision to choose Princess Esther Kamatari as their presidential candidate has drawn a greater degree of attention, both nationally and internationally.

An '''announcer''' is a person who makes "announcements" in an audio medium or a physical location.

==Television and other media==
Some announcers work in [[television production]], [[radio]] or [[filmmaking]], usually providing [[narration]]s, [[news]] updates, [[station identification]], or an introduction of a product in [[television commercial]]s or a guest on a [[talk show]]. Music television announcers were also called video jockeys (VJ).

Announcers are often [[voice actor]]s who read prepared scripts, but in some cases, they have to [[ad-lib]] commentary on the air when presenting news, sports, [[weather forecasting|weather]], time, and [[television commercial]]s. Occasionally, announcers are also involved in writing the [[screenplay]] or [[Script (recorded media)|script]]s when one is required. Sometimes announcers also [[interview]] guests and moderate [[Committee|panel]]s or discussions. Some provide commentary for the [[audience]] during sporting events known as [[sports announcer]]s, [[parade]]s, and other events.

Announcers perform a variety of tasks including presenting news, sports, weather, traffic, and music.  Other duties include interviewing guests, making public appearances at promotional events, announcing station programming information.  Announcers are also sometimes responsible for operating studio equipment and producing/selling advertisements. It is becoming more common to use social media networking sites to keep listeners up to date.  In 2010, the median salary of an announcer in the United States was $27,010.  Television and radio announcers generally have a [[bachelor’s degree]] in communications, broadcasting, or journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Media-and-Communication/Announcers.htm|title=Announcers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|author=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825085804/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/announcers.htm|archivedate=25 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
Radio announcers are often known as disc jockeys (DJs).  While some read from scripts, others completely ad-lib.  These DJs’ tasks consist of on-air interviewing, taking/responding to listener requests, running contests, and making remarks about various subjects like the weather, traffic, sports, and other news.  Most radio announcers announce the artists and titles of songs, but don’t necessarily choose what song airs on the radio.  Many stations have a management teams who select the songs ahead of time. Today radio stations have DJs update the station’s website with music, guest interviews, show schedules, and photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.careeroverview.com/announcers-careers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405082014/http://www.careeroverview.com/announcers-careers.html |archivedate=2012-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live events==
{{anchor|Sports}}[[File:WWE Announcers.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Jim Ross]], [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] announcer]]
[[Public address]] (PA) announcers work in physical locations, including [[sports venue|sporting venues]]. They will give the attendees information about performing acts, speakers, players, score (such as a goal or touchdown), infractions, or the results of the event.

Announcers may be specialized according to sport; for instance, a [[horse race]] announcer provides a rapid-fire second-by-second account of the race (as well as introducing the entries before the race), while a [[horse show]] announcer is the "voice of management" and helps keep the show moving, plays select music and makes announcements during the show. A [[baseball]] announcer may simply introduce the next batter or recap the previous half-[[inning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Shute|title=After 40 years with the Phillies, Baker's voice still choice|date=September 30, 2011|publisher=[[Courier-Post]]|url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/article/20110930/NEWS01/309300020/After-40-years-Phillies-Baker-s-voice-still-choice|accessdate=2011-10-06}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public address announcers may be notable due to their longevity, or tenure with a popular team or venue. Some announcers, particularly in horse racing, may also be known for television or radio work.

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Anvaya.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Logo ]] --&gt;

'''Anvaya''' is a [[Khmer people|Khmer]] association established in 2010 with a self-described mission to "bring together and support the returning movement of scattered [[Ethnic groups in Cambodia|Cambodians]] from overseas". Anaya is an independent, non-political, non-profit organization. It is an active organization within Cambodia and in countries with a Cambodian population that has been scattered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/lift/anvaya-ngo-helps-cambo-dians-return-and-thrive|title=Anvaya: ngo helps cambo dians return and thrive|author=Post Staff|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asialifemagazine.com/cambodia/returning-overseas-cambodians/|title=Returning overseas Cambodians|work=AsiaLIFE Cambodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/11/travel/phnom-penh-travel-cnngo/|title=Phnom Penh: Asia's next cosmopolitan star?|author=Karla Cripps, CNN|date=11 September 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anvaya has over 300 registered members, collectively called “Anvayiste” or "Diaspora", across the world.

== Origin of name and emblem ==
The name Anvaya (in Khmer script: អន្វយៈ) comes from the [[Sanskrit]] language and means family or lineage. The Anvaya’s emblem is a set of three lotus flowers, each symbolizing one of the continents of the Diaspora (Europe, America, or Oceania) which together represent Cambodia.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Creation ==
Anvaya was created in 2010 by [[Soreasmey Ke Bin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leshommes.biz/repatriates-cambodia-soreasmey-ke-bin/|title=Repatriates in Cambodia: Soreasmey Ke Bin|work=Les Hommes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrigue|first1=Anne|title=On Asia's new frontier, 40 French entrepreneurs in the East|url=http://issuu.com/magazineasies/docs/40_francais_qui_entreprennent}}&lt;/ref&gt; a French-Cambodian, and [[David Yim]], a Cambodian-American. Upon returning to Cambodia in the early 2000s, they observed that Cambodians that wished to return to their roots had no kind of support system to help them. They then launched Anvaya as a free social network to gather people looking to return to their roots at regular events.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 2013, Anvaya became a fully legal registered association established by Soreasmey Ke Bin, its founding president.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Activities ==
Anvaya has several types of activities to support their members in Cambodia and overseas, including:
* An Afterwork event every second Thursday for members residing in Cambodia,
* A monthly dinner revolving around Cambodian personalities from the government or from Cambodian society, including the French Ambassador, Mr. [[Jean-Claude Poimboeuf]], the director [[Rithy Panh]], the deputy [[Hun Many]] or the deputy from the opposition, [[Mu Sochua]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Besides this, some Anvaya members{{who|date=September 2016}} are distinguishing themselves in different sport competitions (tennis, half-marathon etc.…){{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Relationship with authorities ==
Although Anvaya is non-political, it keeps a strong open dialogue with Cambodian authorities within the government. For example, in October 2012, Anvaya went to the Royal Palace to pay tribute to the [[Norodom Sihanouk|King Father Norodom Sihanouk]]. Anvaya was invited to this time of remembrance by [[Norodom Ranariddh|Prince Norodom Ranariddh]] to be present in the capacity of an element of the civil society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9Zp4790zd8|title=ANVAYA - Last respect to King Father 26/10/12|date=28 October 2012|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A MOU was signed in March 2014 with the Cambodian Olympic Committee in which Anvaya was to recruit athletes from Diaspora for future sporting events such as the [[Southeast Asian Games|SEA Games]] and the Olympic games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/sport/mou-help-find-medalists|title=MoU to help find medalists|author=Dan Riley|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noccambodia.org/website/read.php?lang=en&amp;id=1286|title=MOU Signing Ceremony Between NOCC and ANVAYA|author=Cheth, Dara|work=noccambodia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Anvaya signed an agreement with the French Embassy to build a memorial for the victims of the Khmer Rouge. The monument was designed by Ing Séra, a French-Cambodian artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/7days/sculptor-plans-genocide-memorial-historic-french-embassy-grounds|title=Sculptor plans genocide memorial for historic French embassy grounds|author=Emily Wight|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was recognized by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia as a meaningful reparation for Khmer Rouge victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/articles/meaningful-reparation-khmer-rouge-victims|title=Meaningful reparation for Khmer Rouge victims|work=Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction started in summer 2015, a first piece has been installed in June 2017, and the official inauguration is planned for October 2017.

'''Armenians in Austria''' refers to ethnic Armenians living in [[Austria]]. They number around 6,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/population.html ArmenianDiaspora website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511084353/http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/population.html |date=2013-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and mainly live in [[Vienna]]. There is also the very important presence of the [[Mekhitarist Order]] in [[Vienna]] that plays a major role in the country as well as worldwide.

== History ==

=== Prior to the late 18th century ===

The history of Armenians in Austria dates back to the time of Vienna's liberation from the Turkish siege at the end of the 17th century, when several Armenian merchants found a new market in the Habsburg empire.

In fact, the city's characteristic [[coffee culture]] was established and run for a long time in its early decades by Armenian merchants. The very first documented coffee house in Vienna was opened on 17 January 1685, by Johannes Deodat (or Diodato, known in Armenian as Owanes Astouatzatur - Յովհաննէս Աստուածատուր - some sources claiming him to be Greek).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.werbeka.com/krog/cafee.htm|title=COFFEE|website=Werbeka.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafe-wien.at/en/cafe-wien/history-of-the-viennese-coffeehouse/|title=Café Wien :: History of the Viennese Coffeehouse|website=Cafe-wien.at|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wien-vienna.com/coffee.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509034045/http://www.wien-vienna.com/coffee.php |archivedate=2012-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the 1770s Austrian annexations of Galicia and Bukovina ===

In 1772-1774, the Austrian Empire annexed [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (see [[Austrian Partition]], as part of the late-18th century [[Partitions of Poland]]) and especially the formerly [[Moldavia|Moldavian]] [[Voivodeship]] of [[Bukovina]] (see [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]]; today a part of the [[Ukraine]]), which at the time held the largest area contiguously settled by Armenians in Europe, and the Bukovian and Galician Armenians automatically became subjects to the Empire. In 1775, Maria Theresa gave official permission to the [[Mechitarists|Mechitarist]] Congregation of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] to settle in the Habsburg Empire. The Mekhitarian congregation in Vienna contributed to the spread of Armenian culture in central Europe through its printing, its library and its college for Armenian boys.

At the beginning of the 19th century, the Austrian Armenians enjoyed officially recognized status as an autonomous religious community. The Armenian community in Vienna grew constantly, so that already in 1896 the first efforts were made to found an Armenian-Apostolic community. In 1912, a small chapel was established in Vienna.

=== WWI and its aftermath ===

[[World War I]] and its aftermath transformed the Austrian Armenian community: The area of the [[Bukovina Armenians]] was lost during the war, but a wave of immigrants came to Austria as a result of the [[Armenian Genocide]] perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks in 1915. After 1918,  Galicia became part of a re-established Poland again, while the Bukovina region and much of its Armenian population became part of Romania (and in 1947 was turned over to the USSR and today the Ukraine, which prompted most of its Armenian population to leave to Poland and Czechoslovakia after 1947).

After the appointment of the first Armenian pastor in Vienna in the 1920s, the number of Armenians in Austria continued to grow, also boosted by refugees from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], as well as migrant Armenian workers from [[Turkey]] and more recently from the Republic of [[Armenia]].

=== After 1945 ===

In 1968, the Surp Hripsime Armenian Apostolic Church of Vienna was consecrated, giving a new impetus to the ever growing Armenian community in Austria. There is also a Saturday Armenian School named [[Hovhannes Shiraz]].

Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1996. Armenia has an embassy in [[Vienna]] and Austria is represented in Armenia through its embassy in [[Moscow]] ([[Russia]]).

== Mechitarist Order in Vienna (1810-Present) ==
Although the monastic headquarters of the [[Mekhitarist Order]] founded by Mekhitar da Pietro(1676-1749), an [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] monk is on the island of St. Lazarus in [[Venice]] (San Lazzaro Monastero Armeno in [[Italian language|Italian]]), the [[Mechitarists]] have kept an important presence in [[Vienna]] since 1810.

Even much before, actually in 1775, Maria Theresa had already given the official permission to the [[Mechitarists]] congregation of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] to settle in the Habsburg Empire and they had established in [[Trieste]].

By 1810, they established a new monastic center in [[Vienna]] using a Franciscan church. When in 1835, the church the Order was using burnt down completely, the Mechitarists hired the services of one of the most famous architects of Vienna of the time [[Josef Kornhäusel]] for constructing a new church.

Due to financial issues, the construction of the designed church  failed to materialize for a few decades. When the church was finally built, a new architect called Fritz Sitte had already altered the designs considerably. He, and later his son [[Camillo Sitte]] finished building the church in 1874.

Vienna Congregation is not just a religious center, but a veritable cultural center for Armenians as well. The monks especially cultivated the [[Armenian language]], [[Armenian history]] and [[Armenian literature]] and published all of the old [[Armenian writer]]s' works with commentaries under the title of "National Library". [[Aydinian]] of Vienna wrote the fundamental textbook of modern Armenian grammar in 1866; [[Mikayel Chamchian|Tschamtschian]] (1738-1823) published a 3-volume history in Venice (which then belonged to Austria), and in Vienna [[Garagaschian]] (1818-1903) wrote a 4-volume history of Armenia.

The Vienna branch has been publishing ''[[Handes Amsorya]]'', a scholarly publication on Armenian linguistics and philology, since 1887.

The library of the Mechitarist Congregation, founded in 1773, owns a special collection of Armenian and Oriental manuscripts (approx. 153,000 vols., 2,000 manuscripts, numismatic collection). The Library has recently announced the formation of the digital list of the Library's books and manuscripts available online.

An association was formed for the propagation of good books worldwide to all Armenian communities, and a high-quality printing press that published average of six new works each year.

A herb liquor called “[[Mechitharine]]” and produced by the monks is said to contain 43 herbs and 12 fruits – the precise ingredients and recipe remains is a secret and known by only two monks at a time. The Mechitharine is still produced today and sold commercially by the monks.

'''Audhali''' ({{Lang-ar|العوذلي}} ''{{transl|ar|al-‘Awdhalī}}'' or {{lang|ar|العواذل}} ''{{transl|ar|al-‘Awādhal}}''), or the '''Audhali Sultanate''' ({{lang-ar|سلطنة العوذلي}} ''{{transl|ar|Salṭanat al-‘Awdhalī}}''), was a state in the [[British Empire|British]] [[Aden Protectorate]]. It was a founding member of the [[Federation of Arab Emirates of the South]] in 1959 and its successor, the [[Federation of South Arabia]], in 1963. Its capital was [[Zarah, Yemen|Zarah]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dresch. ''A History of Modern Yemen.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The date of the foundation of the Sultanate is uncertain. The `Awdhali Sultanate became a [[British protectorate]] in 1890. Its last sultan, Salih ibn al Husayn ibn Jabil Al Audhali, was deposed and his state was abolished in 1967 upon the founding of the [[People's Republic of South Yemen]]. The area is now part of the Republic of [[Yemen]].

===Rulers===
The rulers of the `Awdhali Sultanate had the style of ''Sultan al-Saltana al-`Awdhaliyya''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yemen_protectorate.html States of the Aden Protectorates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Ball was born in Waterloo, Iowa, where he was influenced by his mother's role as a theater director, while Nogues, from Buenos Aires, was inspired by his father's work in aerospace engineering. The two met as undergraduate students at the [[Southern California Institute of Architecture]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Paul|title=Ball-Nogues makes architecture for the moment|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-ball-nogues2-2009aug02-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation, Ball worked as a set and production designer for films (including work on the Matrix series),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nouwens|first1=Monica|title=Emerging Voices 2011: Ball-Nogues Studio|url=http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=5234#.Vn9yElKr_8s|website=The Architect's Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; music videos, and commercials with influential directors such as [[Mark Romanek]] and [[Tony Scott]]. He also contributed to more traditional architectural projects including working on medical facilities, residential projects, and commercial projects such as the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]]. 

After graduating from [[Southern California Institute of Architecture|SCI-Arc]], Nogues moved directly into a position at [[Gehry Partners]], where he worked in product design and production, becoming a specialist in creative fabrication. He remained at Gehry Partners until 2005, except for a one-year stint in 1996 as an assistant curator at a fine arts publishing house, [[Gemini GEL]].

==Work==

[[File:PulpPavilion IMG.jpg|thumb|''Pulp Pavilion'' by Ball-Nogues Studio at the 2015 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]Ball and Nogues collaborated on their first joint project, entitled ''Maximilian's Schell'', in 2005. The installation was located in the courtyard of [[Materials &amp; Applications]], an architecture gallery space in Los Angeles, California. The piece was a multi-story structure made of semi-translucent, semi-reflective Mylar petals that resembled a colorful vortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Paul|title=Ball-Nogues makes architecture for the moment|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-ball-nogues2-2009aug02-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chang|first1=Jade|title=Courtyard Vortex|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/October-2005/Courtyard-Vortex/|website=Metropolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work received substantial recognition, including a Los Angeles [[American Institute of Architects]] Design Award in 2006, [[I.D. (magazine)|I.D. Magazine]]’s Annual Design Review for Best of Category for Environments in 2006; and as an Emerging Architecture Finalist for the Mies Crown Hall Americas Prize in 2014.

The studio has also completed three installations for the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]: ''Copper Droopscape'' in 2008, ''Elastic Plastic Sponge'' in 2009, and ''Pulp Pavilion'' in 2015. In 2015, [[Architect magazine|Architect Magazine]] bestowed the First Award for its 2015 R+D Awards to the studio for ''Pulp Pavilion'', noting that the “project’s innovative design, ambitious scale, and novel use of a recycled material wowed the jury.” The pavilion was made of recycled paper pulp, a material that the studio had been experimenting with and developing for several years. It comprised seven 20-foot-tall woven tree forms and spanned 1,300 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humphries|first1=Courtney|title=First Award: Pulp Pavilion|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/awards/r-d-awards/first-award-pulp-pavilion_o|website=Architect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable works include ''Skin and Bones: Parallel Practices in Fashion and Architecture'', a temporary installation at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] (MOCA), a temporary event environment for [[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany &amp; Company]]’s formal introduction of the Frank Gehry jewelry and accessories line, made of 4,000 layers of corrugated cardboard sandwiched together, and ''Liquid Sky'', a kaleidoscopic Mylar shade structure created by the studio as the winner of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MOMA) [[MoMA PS1|P.S.1]] Young Architects Program competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=Two Low-Key Young Architects With an Attitude, a Vision and Now a Prize|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/24/arts/design/24cour.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bessarabian Bulgarians''' ({{lang-bg|бесарабски българи}}, ''besarabski bǎlgari'', {{lang-ro|bulgari basarabeni}}) are a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] minority group of the historical region of [[Bessarabia]], inhabiting parts of present-day [[Ukraine]] ([[Odessa Oblast]]) and [[Moldova]].

==Location and number==
[[File:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]
[[File:Harta etnica a Republicii Moldova la nivel de comune.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Moldova]] ''(brown)'']]

===Modern Ukraine===
In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bessarabian Bulgarians is estimated at over 129,000 in [[Budjak]] (in the [[Odessa Oblast]] in the southern part of the country), and 75,000 elsewhere (mostly in other parts of Southern Ukraine), according to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]], which counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians in Ukraine.

Bulgarians are a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District (45,600 of its 75,000 inhabitants), but they also inhabit other districts of [[Budjak]]: Arciz – 20,200 of the 51,700, Tarutino – 17,000 of the 45,200, Izmail – 14,100 of the 54,700, and Sarata – 10,000 of the 49,900. There are also 8,600 Bulgarians in the city of [[Izmayil]] (85,100 total population).

Outside Budjak, [[Odessa]] has many Bulgarians that have moved there in recent years. The city of [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky]] is about 4% Bulgarian, making them the third-largest ethnicity there.

===Modern Moldova===
The results of the census held in October 2004, there are 65,072 Bessarabian Bulgarians (1.95% of the population) in [[Moldova]] (excluding the region of Transnistria), concentrated mostly in the southern parts&amp;nbsp;— chiefly in [[Taraclia district]]. In the census held in November 2004 in Transnistria, 3,164 (3.16%) Bulgarians have been counted in [[Tighina]] and surroundings and further 10,515 (2.39%) on the Eastern bank of the river Dnestr.

29,447 Bulgarians live in the cities (and represent 2.26% of the urban dwellers), and 36,215 live in the countryside (1.74% of the rural inhabitants). 90.60% of ethnic Bulgarians were born in Moldova (the national average is 94.6%), 5,968 (9.09%) in other countries that were once in the Soviet Union (the national average is 5.16%), and 199 (0.30%) were born elsewhere.

In Moldova (and likely Ukraine too, although statistics are not available here), the Bulgarians tend to use their native Bulgarian in rural areas, and Russian (instead of the majority language Romanian) in cities and towns. 53,178 or 80.99% of ethnic Bulgarians declared [[Bulgarian language]] as native (69.23% in urban areas, and 90.55% in rural ones), 2,766 or 4.21% of them declared [[Romanian language]] as native (4.91% in urban areas, and 3.64% in rural ones), 9,134 or 13.91% of them declared [[Russian language]] as native (25.08% in urban areas, and 4.83% in rural ones), and 584 or 0.89% of them declared another language as native (0.78% in urban areas, and 0.98% in rural ones).

35,808 or 54.53% of ethnic Bulgarians declared [[Bulgarian language]] as first language in daily use (36.81% in urban areas, and 68.95% in rural ones), 5,698 or 8.68% of them declared [[Moldovan language]]/[[Romanian language]] as first (7.93% in urban areas, and 9.29% in rural ones), 23,259 or 35.42% of them declared [[Russian language]] as first (54.45% in urban areas, and 19.95% in rural ones), and 897 or 1.37% of them declared another first language (0.81% in urban areas, and 1.81% in rural ones).

Bessarabian Bulgarians represent 28,293, or 65.56% of the population of the [[Taraclia district]]. There are also Bulgarians in [[Chişinău]] (8,868, or 1.2%), [[Găgăuzia]] (8,013, or 5.1%), [[Cahul district]] (5,816, or 4.9%), [[Leova district]] (3,804, or 7.4%), and [[Cantemir district]] (3,736, or 6.2%). The share of ethnic Bulgarians in [[Transnistria]] is 10,515 (2.39%), of which 2,450 (1.55%) in [[Tiraspol]], and 7,323 (8.44%) in [[Slobozia sub-district]] (which contains the village of Parcani). There are also 3,001 (3.09%) Bulgarians in the city of [[Tighina]], and 342 in 3 suburbs. In total, there are 79,520 (2.02%) Bulgarians in Moldova, including Transnistria.

Bessarabian Bulgarians represent a majority in one city of Moldova, [[Taraclia]] (10,732 Bulgarians, or 78%) and in 8 communes in the country:
* [[Tvardiţa]] (Tvarditsa, Tvarditca), Taraclia district (5,396 of 5,882 inhabitants, 91.7%)
* [[Corten, Taraclia|Corten]], Taraclia district (3,036 of 3,407 inhabitants, 87.5%)
* [[Colibabovca]], Leova district (934 of 1,142 inhabitants, 81.8%)
* [[Cairaclia]], Taraclia district (1,733 of 2,124 inhabitants, 81.6%)
* [[Stoianovca]], Cantemir district (1,055 of 1,372 inhabitants, 76.9%)
* [[Valea Perjei, Taraclia|Valea Perjei]], Taraclia district (3,792 of 4,986 inhabitants, 76%)
* [[Vozneseni]], Leova district (985 of 1,396 inhabitants, 70.5%)
* [[Parcani, Transnistria|Parcani]], Transnistria territorial unit, cca. 60%, exact data unknown

== History ==
[[File:Tvardica 1.JPG|right|thumb|The welcome sign of [[Tvardiţa]], Moldova, written mostly in Bulgarian]]

The modern population of Bessarabian Bulgarians settled in the region of southern Bessarabia at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]], and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants from the western areas of the Bulgarian homelands (as far west as modern-day Albania) but had moved east in and before the 18th century. Alongside the Bulgarians who immigrated to Bessarabia were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time before.

When  Russian Armies were reaching and crossing [[Danube]] during the Russian-Ottoman Wars, some local Bulgarians supported them. These people were compromised in the eyes of the Ottomans and therefore had a better chance moving to the Russian Empire. The Russian Propaganda also worked to convince Bulgarians to settle in areas recently conquered by them, from which Tatars were removed. Bulgarians settled not only in Bessarabia, but also in the Kherson region.&lt;ref name="Ion Nistor 1923, p. 200-201"&gt;Ion Nistor, ''Istoria Basarabiei'', Cernăuţi, 1923, reprinted Chişinău, Cartea Moldovenească, 1991, p. 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, Bulgarian and [[Gagauzians|Gagauzian]] refugees in Bessarabia are mentioned in 1769. The 1817 census found Bulgarians in 12 Bessarabian villages in the valleys of the {{ill|Ialpug River|lt=Ialpug|ro|Râul Ialpug}} and [[Lunga River (Ialpug River)|Lunga River]]s (Creeks): 482 Bulgarian and Gagauzian families and 38 Romanian families in these 12 villages. The leader of the Bulgarians and Gagauzians was a man referred to as Copceac. Seven of the 12 villages were Gagauzian ([[Baurci]], [[Beşalma]], [[Ceadîr-Lunga]], Chessău, [[Dezghingea]], [[Gaidar, Găgăuzia|Gaidar]], and [[Tomai, Gagauzia|Tomai]]), and 5 were Bulgarian.&lt;ref name="Ion Nistor 1923, p. 200-201"/&gt;

After arriving in Bessarabia, Bulgarians and Gagauzians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 (according to some sources{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}) or 43 (according to other sources&lt;ref name="Ion Nistor"&gt;Ion Nistor&lt;/ref&gt;) villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], two counties of southern Bessarabia, [[Cahul County]] and [[Ismail County]], reverted to the [[Principality of Moldavia]] (since 1861&amp;nbsp;– [[Kingdom of Romania]]).  These included the cities of [[Bolgrad]], [[Izmail|Ismail]] and [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Chilia]]. [[Gaguzian]] settlements centred on [[Comrat]], however, remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian high school (gymnasium), the [[Bolhrad High School]], was founded in Bolgrad (Bolhrad) on June 28, 1858 by the Moldavian authorities of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]],&lt;ref name="Ion Nistor"/&gt; which had a positive effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861, 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community—the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region of Bessarabia was re-incorporated again by the Russia Empire in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during the Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|united]] with Romania in April 1918, after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were not returned, as many Bulgarians underwent [[Romanianization]] policies.

During the [[Tatarbunar Uprising]] of 1924, when Soviets unsuccessfully tried to overthrow the Romanian administration in southern [[Bessarabia]], many Bulgarians (alongside local Moldovans (Romanians), and [[Bessarabian Germans]]) sided with Romanian authorities, as pointed out by [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]] in the report given on behalf of the Ministry of the Interior to the Romanian Parliament in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;M. Adauge, A. Furtuna, ''Basarabia si basarabenii'', Chişinău, 1991, p. 292–294&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to a Soviet ultimatum in June 1940, the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|invasion]] of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion into the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the Bessarabian Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980s, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established, and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]: first only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993, and [[Taraclia State University]], co-funded by the Bulgarian state, was established in the largely Bulgarian-populated Moldovan town of [[Taraclia]] in 2004. The languages of education at the university are Bulgarian and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].

The '''Chamber of Peers''' (French: ''Chambre des Pairs'') was the upper house of the [[French parliament]] from 1814 to 1848.

== History ==
The [[Peerage of France]] was recreated by the [[Charter of 1814]] at the same time as the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Bourbon Restoration]], albeit on a different basis from that of the [[ancien regime]] before 1789. A new Chamber of Peers was created which was similar to the British [[House of Lords]], and it met at the [[Palais du Luxembourg]]. [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Like the House of Lords]], the Chamber of Peers had a judicial function, being authorized to judge peers and other prominent people. As such, it judged [[Marshall Ney]] to death. 

This new Chamber of Peers acted as the [[Upper House]] of the French parliament. To begin with it had 154 members, including the holders of all surviving pre-Revolutionary ecclesiastical (Reims, Langres, and Châlons) and lay peerages, except for the [[Duchy of Aubigny]], which was held by a foreigner, the [[Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]]. Thirteen peers were also [[prelate]]s. 

New members were appointed by the king, without limit on their numbers. Such a peerage was either granted for life or was heritable, at the king's will. All men of the royal family and all descendants in the male line of previous kings (''princes du sang'') were members of the chamber by birth (''pairs-nés''), but nevertheless they needed explicit permission from the king to sit at each session of the chamber.

At the outset comprising only hereditary peers and certain prelates of the church, the Chamber became a body to which men were appointed for life following the [[July Revolution]] of 1830. In the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|Revolution of 1848]], the Chamber of Peers was disbanded and the peerage of France was abolished.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4009">'''Chicago Norske Klub''' (1911 to 1971) was a [[Chicago, Illinois]] based [[Norwegian-American]] cultural and social organization.

==Background==
Chicago Norske Klub was founded in 1911 through the merger of two prior organizations which had dated to 1890, the Norwegian Club in Chicago (''Den Norske Klub i Chicago'') and the Norwegian Quartet Club (''Den Norske Kvartet Klub''). 

Its membership consisted largely of businessmen  and professionals including a number of graduates of Norwegian technical schools. Programs were aimed at sociability and fellowship. The Chicago Norske Klub established premises near [[Logan Square, Chicago|Logan Square]] on Kedzie Avenue through financing arranged by the [[State Bank of Chicago]] and through the initiative of [[Birger Osland]], a Chicago investment banker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torskeklub.com/history/NorskeKlub.pdf ''Chicago Norske Klub'' (Norwegian-American Immigration Commission 1825-1925)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
[[Emil Biorn]] was the instructor and leader of a chorus and an orchestra for a number of years. The Dramatic Society was founded in 1919. In 1920, an annual art exhibit was started.  The club was noted for its collection of fine art principally by Norwegian-American artists. Among others, featured artists included  [[Sigvald Asbjørnsen]], [[Benjamin Blessum]], [[Carl L. Boeckmann]], [[Lars Fletre]], [[Alexander Grinager]],  [[Arvid Nyholm]], [[Bror Julius Olsson Nordfeldt]], [[Karl Ouren]] and [[Svend Rasmussen Svendsen]].

The Chicago Norske Klub was also the site of a convention sponsored by the Norwegian-American Technical Society of Chicago. The club ended operation and sold its building to a lodge of the [[Sons of Norway]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/pubs/nas/volume12/vol12_6.htm ''Norwegian Clubs in Chicago''; by Birger Osland. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume XII, p. 105]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guest speakers==
The club featured a number of notable guest speakers during the course of its existence.

'''David Rath''' (born 25 December 1965) is a Czech [[physician]] and [[politician]] who served as [[Ministry of Health (Czech Republic)|Minister of Health]] from 2005 to 2006. He was a member of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party]] (ČSSD) until 16 May 2012 when he resigned&lt;ref&gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/rath-rezignoval-na-post-hejtmana-stredoceskeho-kraje-pdc-/domaci.aspx?c=A120516_152808_praha-zpravy_cen "Rath skončil jako hejtman i v ČSSD, rezignoval ze zastupitelstva kraje"]&lt;/ref&gt; after being charged with bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/primy-prenos-tiskova-konference-policie-k-obvineni-poslance-ratha-106-/domaci.aspx?c=A120515_165607_domaci_jw|title=PŘÍMÝ PŘENOS: Tisková konference policie k obvinění poslance Ratha|date=15 May 2012|work=[[Mladá fronta DNES]]|publisher=iDnes|language=Czech|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as Member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (MP) from 2006 to 2013, first as representative from [[Prague]] and then from [[Central Bohemian Region]] where he was Governor between 2008 and 2012.

On 23 July 2015, Rath was sentenced to 8.5 years in prison for [[corruption]] and manipulation with [[Government procurement|government procurements]]. However, Rath appealed to the verdict.

== Medical career ==
Rath completed his medical degree at [[Charles University in Prague]] in 1990. He practiced internal medicine at General Teaching Hospital in Prague (Všeobecná fakultní nemocnice), and then at the Faculty Hospital at Motol (Fakultní nemocnice v Motole). Then in [[Kralupy nad Vltavou]] he worked for the Samaritan Association. He returned to Prague and joined the internal medicine faculty at Charles University in 1995. From 1998 to 2005 Rath served as the president of the Czech Doctors' Chamber (Česká Lékařská Komora, or ČLK), an umbrella organisation for all Czech physicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmanews.cz/09_2002/09-02%20pharma-lekarnici.htm Rosenbaum, Zdeněk (May 2002) "Lékaři A Lékárníci: Společně I Sami" ''Pharma News'' Prague] interview with David Rath as president of the ČLK in [[Czech language|Czech]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
In 1994 Rath joined the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] (ODS). In 1995 he formed the Medical Action Group (or Physician's Union Club) within the party, which brought in significant monetary support during the 1998 elections. As director of the Physician's Union Club Rath initiated the November 1996 doctor's strike. In 1996 he was vice-chairman of the Free Democrats - Liberal National Socialist Party coalition (SD-LSNS).

In November 2005, the Prime Minister at the time, [[Jiří Paroubek]], appointed him health minister. He was directed to fix the finances of the troubled Czech health system, and he proceeded to institute a number of radical reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Krosnar, Katka (1 April 2006) "Czech health workers call for minister to be sacked" ''The Lancet'' 367(9516): p. 1046&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006 Rath made international news when he traded blows with former [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Miroslav Macek]] at a [[Dentistry|dentists']] conference after reportedly implying that Macek had married his wife for her money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5001414.stm|title=Czech politicians exchange blows|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 May 2006|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macek was later fined for having initiated the violence by slapping Rath on the back of the head prior to delivering a speech at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/vyhledavani/index_view.php?id=210085 ČTK (18 September 2006) "Macek fined 3,000 crowns for slap to ex-minister Rath" ''Czech News Agency'' Prague ]&lt;/ref&gt;

As required by the Namibian ''Statistics Act'' #66 of 1976, and in accordance with [[United Nations]] recommendations, a [[census]] is conducted every ten years. After [[Independence of Namibia|Namibian independence]] the first Population and Housing Census was carried out in 1991, further rounds followed in 2001 and 2011.&lt;ref name=2001Census&gt;{{cite web

The 2011 Population and Housing Census counted 2,113,077 inhabitants of Namibia. Between 2001 and 2011 the annual population growth was 1.4%, down from 2.6% in the previous ten–year period.&lt;ref name=snapshot&gt;{{cite news

In 2011 the total fertility rate was 3.6 children per woman, down from 4.1 in 2001.

===UN estimates===
According to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Namibia}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 485 000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 36.4%, 59.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.7% was 65 years or older

==Ethnic groups==
[[Namibia]]ns are of diverse ethnic origins. The principal groups are the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]], [[Kavango people|Kavango]], [[Herero people|Herero]]/[[Himba people|Himba]], [[Damara (people)|Damara]], mixed race ([[Coloured People in Namibia|Coloured]] and Rehoboth [[Baster]]), [[White Namibians]] ([[Afrikaner]], [[Germans of Namibia|German]], British and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]), [[Nama people|Nama]], Caprivian ([[Lozi people|Lozi]]), [[San people|San]], and [[Tswana people|Tswana]]. The Coloureds and Basters share similar genealogical origins and cultural attributes (such as home language) but nonetheless maintain distinctly separate communal identities, as do most white Namibians and black Namibians, respectively.

The Ovambo make up about half of Namibia's people. The Ovambo, Kavango, and East Caprivian peoples, who occupy the relatively well-watered and wooded northern part of the country, are settled farmers and herders. Historically, they have shown little interest in the central and southern parts of Namibia, where conditions do not suit their traditional way of life.

Until the early 20th century, these tribes had little contact with the Nama, Damara, and Herero, who settled around the central part of the country vying for control of sparse pastureland. German colonial rule destroyed the warmaking ability of the tribes but did not erase their identities or traditional organization. People from the more populous north have settled throughout the country in recent decades as a result of urbanization, industrialization, and the demand for labor.

The minority white population is primarily of [[South Africa]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], and German descent, with a few Portuguese. About 60% of the whites speak [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] (a language derived from the 17th century Dutch), 32% speak German, and 7% speak English.

==Religion==
Missionary work during the 19th century drew many Namibians to [[Christianity]], especially [[Lutheranism]]. While most Namibian Christians are Lutheran, there also are [[Roman Catholic]], [[Methodist]], [[Anglican]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|African Methodist Episcopal]], and [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed Christian]]s represented.

*[[Christian]] 80% to 90% (at least 50% [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]])&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt;
*[[Indigenous religions|Indigenous beliefs]] 10% to 20%

== CIA World Factbook demographic statistics ==
Modern education and medical care have been extended in varying degrees to most rural areas in recent years. The literacy rate of Africans is generally low except in sections where missionary and government education efforts have been concentrated, such as [[Ovamboland]]. The Africans speak various indigenous languages.

The following demographic statistics are from the [[CIA World Factbook]],&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=CIA |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Namibia |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/wa.html |year=2009|accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless otherwise indicated.

The '''Dimasa language''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language spoken by the [[Dimasa people]] in [[North East India|Northeastern]] part of [[India]] , states of [[Assam]] and [[Nagaland]]. The Dimasa language is known to Dimasas as "Grao-Dima" and it is similar to  [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Kokborok]] and [[Garo language|Garo]] language of [[India]].

== Etymology ==
The Dimasa language is one of the oldest languages spoken in [[North East India]], particularly in [[Assam]]. The word Dimasa etymologically translates to "Son of the big river" (Dima-river, sa-sons), the river being the mighty [[Brahmaputra]]. The Dimasa word "Di"  meaning water, forms the root of the names of many of the major rivers of [[Assam]] and of [[North East India]] in general, such as Doigrung which means narrow river, Doyang which means huge river, Dikrang, which means green river, Dikhow, which means fetched water, and many others. The mighty river [[Brahmaputra]] is known as Dilao (long river) among the [[Dimasa people|Dimasas]] even now. Many of the important towns and cities in [[Assam]] and [[Nagaland]] received their names from Dimasa words such as [[Diphu]], [[Dimapur]] (a capital of the [[Dimasa Kingdom]]), [[Hojai]], Khaspur, etc. In fact, the Dimasa language is one of the last languages of [[North East India]] to retain its original vocabulary without being compromised by foreign languages.{{sfn|Endle|1911|p=4}}

==Geographical distribution==
Dimasa is spoken in:

*[[Assam]]: [[Dima Hasao District]] (formerly North Cachar Hills District), [[Cachar District]], [[Karbi Anglong District]], [[Nagaon District]], [[Hojai District]] (formerly a part of Nagaon District)
*[[Nagaland]]
*[[Meghalaya]]
*[[Mizoram]]

==Grammar==
Dimasa language is a very mildly inflected language. The verbs are rarely inflected for number, but not for gender and person.

===Nouns===
The nouns can be proper, common, abstract, collective etc.

====Proper Nouns====
Deringdao(Dimasa male name),
Lairingdi(Dimasa female name)

====Common nouns====
Miya/Mia/Mya(boy),
Masainjik(girl)

====Abstract nouns====
Khajama(happiness),
Dukhu(sadness)

===Pronouns===
Ang(1st person singular)&lt;br /&gt;Jing (1st person plural)&lt;br /&gt;
Ning(2nd person singular)&lt;br /&gt;Nisi(2nd person plural)&lt;br /&gt;Bo(3rd person singular)&lt;br /&gt;Bunsi(3rd person plural)

===Adjectives===
Guju- Tall, Gedé- big

===Sentence syntax===
Usually it is of ''' S+O+V''' type. For example:  &lt;br/&gt;    
Ang  ('''S''')      makham ('''O''')      jidu('''V''').&lt;br/&gt; That means
I am having food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Another one,&lt;br/&gt; Bo('''S''') makham jidu.&lt;br/&gt;That means -  He/she is having food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thus, we can see that the verb is rarely inflected for person and gender.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It can also be of the type '''O+ V+ S'''.
For example:&lt;br/&gt;
Makham('''O''')    jidu('''V''')       ang('''S''').&lt;br/&gt; That also means - I am having food.

==Writing system==
Dimasa is written using the [[Latin script]], which has been introduced in the lower primary education system in Dima Hasao District. The main guiding force behind it is the Dimasa Lairidim Hosom, a literary apex body of the Dimasa community.&lt;ref&gt;http://online.assam.gov.in/tribes_of_assam#Dimasa Kachari&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] is used in Cachar, where the Bengali people live alongside  Dimasas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/langalph.htm|title=Index of languages by writing system|author=|date=|website=www.omniglot.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11195">[[File:Gregory XIV.PNG|thumb|right|[[Pope Gregory XIV]] made gambling on papal elections punishable by [[excommunication]].]]
'''Gambling on papal elections''' has at least a 500-year history. Betting on 16th-century [[papal conclave]]s are among the first documented examples of gambling on election outcomes.&lt;ref name="rhode"&gt;Paul W. Rhode and Koleman Strumpf. 2008. "[http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/w14377.pdf Historical Political Futures Markets: An International Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711101616/http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/w14377.pdf |date=2010-07-11 }}". NBER Working Paper 14377.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, gambling was also common on the outcomes of secular Italian elections, such as that of the [[Doge of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Walker. 1999. "Gambling and the Venetian Noblemen, c. 1500-1700". ''Past and Present''. No. 162:  28-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==15th century==
The [[Republic of Venice]] forbade betting on the pope's life in 1419, and canceled bets already made. [[Life insurance]] policies were often taken out on the current pope, sometimes as genuine insurance by businessmen owed money by the papacy who feared a change of Pontiff, but also a purely speculative venture.  Such policies on the lives of popes and other notable figures were forbidden in [[Barcelona]] (1435) and [[Genoa]] (1467 and 1494).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th century==
The first recorded example of gambling on the candidate to be selected by a papal election occurs with the [[papal conclave, September 1503]], although Frederic Baumgartner, a historian of papal elections, considers it then already "an old practice".&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, pp. 88, 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the election of [[Leo X]] in 1513, it has been stated:	
:Betting on the outcome of papal elections was quite common and was often handled by the banking houses in Rome which employed ''sensali'', or messengers, to scurry back and forth delevering betting slips. Bettors watched the odds closely ...&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Meriam Bullard, ''Filippo Strozzi and the Medici'', [[Cambridge Univ. Press]] (1980), p. 72 n. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and during the [[papal conclave 1549-1550]], many Roman bankers offered [[Spread betting|betting spreads]] on the ''[[papabile|papabili]]'' (cardinals likely to be elected). According to the Venetian Enrico Dandolo, a witness to the conclave, "it is more than clear that the merchants are very well informed about the state of the poll, and that the cardinals' attendants in Conclave go partners with them in wagers, which thus causes many tens of thousands of crowns to change hands". Dandolo describes an early example of [[insider trading]].&lt;ref name="baum305"&gt;Baumgartner, 1985, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Julius III|Cardinal del Monte]] (who was eventually elected Julius III) had eventually started out as the favorite at -1, trailed by [[Giovanni Salviati|Salviati]], [[Niccolò Ridolfi|Ridolfi]], and [[Reginald Pole|Pole]], but Pole was the favorite three days later at 4-1.&lt;ref name="baum306"&gt;Baumgartner, 1985, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 5, Pole's odds had shortened to 100-95.&lt;ref name="baum306"/&gt; With the arrival of four additional French cardinals on December 11, Pole's odds drifted to 5-2.&lt;ref name="baum308"&gt;Baumgartner, 1985, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 22, the odds quoted against the conclave finishing during January were 10-9, against February: 2-1, against March: 5-1, and never: 10-1.&lt;ref name="baum310"&gt;Baumgartner, 1985, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1591, [[Pope Gregory XIV]] imposed a penalty of [[excommunication]] against any who wagered on the outcome or length of papal elections (as well as the creation of cardinals),&lt;ref name="rhode"/&gt; and banned the practice in the [[Papal States]].&lt;ref&gt;Noelle Knox. 2005, April 18. "Gamblers bet on who will be chosen as next pope". ''USA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The canon was abrogated (along with the rest of existing [[canon law]]) by [[Pope Benedict XV]]'s reforms &lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward.  2013, February 26.  [http://canonlawblog.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/betting-on-the-conclave/ "Betting on the Conclave"]. ''In Light of the Law''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
According to a ''New York Times'' article following the [[papal conclave, 1878]]: "The Italians are all superstitious, and all fond of the lottery. Every great event leads to speculation in numbers. The deaths and advents of the Popes has always given rise to an excessive amount of gambling in the lottery, and today the people of Italy are in a state of excitement that is indescribable.  Figures are picked out which have some relation with the life or death of Pius IX.  Every day large sums are paid for tickets in the lottery about to be drawn."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1878, March 2. "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E00E5DE143EE73BBC4A53DFB5668383669FDE The Death of Pope Pius IX]". p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
Gambling over the outcomes of the [[papal conclave, 1903]] and [[papal conclave, 1922]] was covered in several newspapers.&lt;ref name="rhode"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Atlanta Constitution''. 1903, July 11. p. 3; ''Chicago Tribune''. 1903, July 27.p. 4; ''Los Angeles Times''. 1903, August 18. p. 5; ''Scotsman''. 1922, January 24. p. 4; ''Scotsman''. 1922, February 7. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; With the 1903 conclave, the Italian government-run lottery offered odds on the pope's death and, had [[Pope Leo XIII]] died a week earlier, the government would have lost over $1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1903, July 11. "Pope Leo's Life Slowly Ebbing". p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was extensive betting in Britain over the elections of [[Pope John Paul I]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], and the English Catholic primate, the [[Archbishop of Westminster]] felt it necessary to forbid participation by Catholics.

==21st century==
[[Paddy Power]],&lt;ref name="gambling-law-us.com"&gt;http://www.gambling-law-us.com/Federal-Laws/wire-act.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland's largest bookmaker, started taking bets on the successor of [[Pope John Paul II]] five years before the pontiff's death.&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;Peter Gould. 2005, April 22. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4465591.stm Bets open on Benedict's successor]". BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; British bookmakers such as [[Pinnacle Sports]] and [[William Hill plc]] also offered such bets, with significantly different odds.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Pogatchnik. 2005, April 18. "Picking the pope a gambler's science at top bookmaker in Ireland". ''AP''.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Ratzinger, the eventual choice of the [[papal conclave, 2005]] as [[Pope Benedict XVI]] started out with 12-1 odds, but was a 3-1 favorite at the time of the conclave.&lt;ref name="gould"/&gt; Mr. Power, the proprietor of Paddy Power, was evicted from [[St. Peter's Square]] by security staff before the start of the 2005 conclave for displaying his betting prices,&lt;ref name="gould"/&gt; by what he claims were undercover police officers.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Delaney. 2005, August 18. "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07EFD71E3EF93BA25757C0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 Holy Rollers And Papal Perfectas]". ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Paddy Power alone took over $382,000 in bets on the conclave, making it&amp;mdash;according to Mr. Power&amp;mdash;"the biggest non-sports betting market of all time".&lt;ref name="gould"/&gt; 
With [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s resignation on February 28, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/11/world/europe/pope-resignation-q-and-a&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paddy Power]]'s website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paddypower.com/bet/current-affairs/pope-betting?ev_oc_grp_ids=1178744&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Papal conclave, 2013]] lists the current successors to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. On March 13, 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected [[Pope Francis]]. Prior to [[Pope Francis]]' election, the odds were 25-to-1 of Bergoglio becoming pope, according to betting company William Hill Plc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-13/argentina-s-cardinal-jorge-bergoglio-is-elected-pope-francis-i.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/WMH:LN&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paddy Power]]'s website also posted 25-to-1 odds shortly before [[Pope Francis]]' election.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/03/meet-jorge-bergoglio-pope-francis-i/63067/&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambling on [[Papal conclave]]s is largely internet based, as most conventional sport books, such as those in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], do not accept bets on election outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Arsenault. 2005, April 15. "[http://www.seattlepi.com/national/220219_popebet15.html Offshore sites let you risk cash, God's wrath on next pope]".

The '''Hayus '''({{lang-ne|हायु}}) are a member of the ''[[Kirant]]'' tribe speaking their own language, [[Wayu language|Wayu or Hayu]]. Little is known about them. They are [[Animist]] by religion. According to the 2001 Nepal census, there are 1821 Hayu in the country, of which 70.29% were Hindus and 23.61% were animists.

The Hayu language has been documented by the linguist Boyd Michailovsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hayu entry in: The Sino-Tibetan Languages|last = Michailovsky|first = Boyd|publisher = Routledge|year = 2003|isbn = |location = London &amp; New York|pages = 518–532|editor-last = Thurgood &amp; LaPolla}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language currently appears in Wikipedia as '[[Vayu language|Vayu]]'.

The '''Home Guard''' was a wartime armed service during [[World War II]] that was established with the primary objective of defending New Zealand from the threat posed by the [[Empire of Japan]].&lt;ref name='archives'&gt;Archives New Zealand: http://archives.govt.nz/research/guides/war&lt;/ref&gt;

The Home Guard, modelled on its [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|British equivalent]], was formed in 1940. Membership was initially voluntary, with a minimum age of 15 but no upper limit. From 1942, membership was compulsory for those in the 35 to 50 age bracket.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGibbon|first1=Ian|title=Second World War - Japan enters the war|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/34574/home-guard|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=15 August 2015|date=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key responsibilities of the Home Guard was the mission of destroying any [[infrastructure]], particularly bridges, that could be used by invading Japanese forces.&lt;ref&gt;Living Heritage: http://www.livingheritage.org.nz/Schools-Stories/Tiniroto-through-the-looking-glass/The-Army-in-Tiniroto&lt;/ref&gt; In [[East Auckland]], the Home Guard was predominantly made up of horse-mounted farmers who had been excused from war service. They carried out exercises in 1942 including one in which they tested the time taken to travel from [[Manukau Harbour]] to the [[Waitematā Harbour]] at Eastern Beach. Farmers with experience from [[World War I]] were used to construct beach obstacles such as barbed wire entanglements and to build concrete [[Pillbox (military)|pillbox]]es. Eastern Beach had such pillboxes at each end. The [[long wave radio]] station at [[Musick Point]] was provided with bomb shelters from which emergency radios could be operated. A [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]] was imposed and enforced by the Home Guard. The wooden wharf at [[Bucklands Beach]], which was believed capable of aiding a Japanese landing, was demolished in 1942.

Members of the Home Guard who served for 28 days full-time or 6 months part-time were eligible for the [[New Zealand War Service Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Defence Force: http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/category/c/c1.html#hg&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak of its membership, the Home Guard had approximately 119,000-123,000 men.&lt;ref name='archives'/&gt;

[[Namibia]] is a country of origin, transit, and destination for foreign and Namibian women and children, and possibly for men subjected to [[Human trafficking|trafficking in persons]], specifically conditions of [[forced labor]] and [[forced prostitution]]. Traffickers exploit Namibian children, as well as children from [[prostitution in Angola|Angola]] and [[prostitution in Zambia|Zambia]], through forced labor in agriculture, cattle herding, [[involuntary servitude|involuntary domestic servitude]], charcoal production, and [[Commercial sexual exploitation of children|commercial sexual exploitation]]. In some cases, Namibian parents unwittingly sell their children to traffickers. Reports indicate that vulnerable Namibian children are recruited for forced [[prostitution]] in Angola and [[prostitution in South Africa|South Africa]], typically by truck drivers. There is also some evidence that traffickers move Namibian women to South Africa and South African women to Namibia to be [[commercial sexual exploitation|exploited]] in forced prostitution. Namibian women and children, including orphans, from rural areas are the most vulnerable to trafficking. Victims are lured by traffickers to urban centers and commercial farms with promises of legitimate work for good wages they may never receive. Some adults subject children to whom they are distantly related to forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation. Small business owners and farmers may also participate in trafficking crimes against women or children. Victims are forced to work long hours to carry out hazardous tasks, and may be [[Battery (crime)|beaten]] or [[rape]]d by traffickers or third parties.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The [[Government of Namibia]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the year, the government created a national database on gender-based violence which will include statistics of trafficking and [[child labor]] victims, cooperated in a baseline study to assess the scope and scale of its trafficking in persons problem, investigated child labor cases, rescued child victims of [[labor trafficking]], and began renovating buildings to use as shelters for trafficking victims. No suspected trafficking offenders, however, were prosecuted, and traffickers involved in cases of forced child labor received insufficient civil punishments.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Namibia". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142761.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Namibia modestly increased its anti-trafficking [[law enforcement]] efforts during the year. [[Namibian Police Force|National police]] and the [[Ministry of Justice (Namibia)|Ministry of Justice]] handled no trafficking cases during the reporting period. In May 2009, the government enacted the Prevention of Organized Crime Act (POCA) of 2004, which explicitly criminalizes all forms of trafficking. Under the POCA, persons who participate in trafficking offenses or aid and abet trafficking offenders may be fined up to $133,000 and imprisoned for up to 50 years. The Act does not differentiate between trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking for non-sexual purposes. In addition, Section 4 of the Labor Act of 2007 prohibits forced labor, and prescribes penalties of up to four years' imprisonment or a fine of up to $2,700, or both. Section 3 of the Labor Act prohibits various forms of exploitative child labor, prescribing penalties equal to those for other forced labor offenses. Penalties for these crimes are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as [[rape]]. The draft Child Care and Protection Bill is expected to address [[child trafficking]] offenses, among other crimes. Government officials are working with the [[Southern African Development Community]] to develop model comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation which could be effectively adopted in countries throughout the region. The government neither opened a [[crime|criminal]] investigation into any suspected trafficking offenses nor prosecuted any trafficking cases during the reporting period. Officials investigated several cases of child labor; in all instances, offenders were issued compliance orders in accordance with the 2007 Labor Act, but were not arrested or otherwise penalized. The Ministry of Labor removed 17 children found working on farms in [[Kavango Region|Kavango]] in hazardous conditions and returned them to their parents. Police operated a toll-free [[hotline]] for the public to call in with tips on trafficking cases.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
During 2009, the government increased its efforts to protect victims and ensure their access to appropriate services offered by non-governmental entities, as it continued to lack the financial resources and capacity to directly care for victims. During the reporting period, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare identified 17 cases of children illegally working in the charcoal industry, 88 cases of children performing hazardous labor in other work places, and 57 cases of children in forced labor. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare (MGECW) handled three trafficking cases; the victims were Zambian boys brought into the country by a Zambian trafficker, a girl from [[Walvis Bay]] forced into [[child prostitution|prostitution]] by her mother, and Namibian girls from Kavango and possibly the [[Caprivi Strip|Caprivi region]] trafficked to wine farms in the south for forced labor as babysitters and domestic workers. In 2009, the MGECW created a national database on [[gender based violence]] that will include statistics on trafficking and child labor victims.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The government has no specific formal procedures in place for referring trafficking victims for care, although the police are responsible for finding temporary shelter for all victims as well as medical assistance. The MGECW provided social workers to work in partnership with the [[police]], who counsel or otherwise assist victims of [[violent crime]]s, including human trafficking. Law enforcement and other officials referred victims to NGOs and other entities that provided short-term shelter facilities. Officials were aware that the shelters are often full and cannot accommodate all victims who need assistance. Neither long-term shelter facilities nor services designed to meet the specific needs of victims of trafficking existed in Namibia. The Woman and Child Protection Unit (WACPU) of the Namibian Police Force designated examination rooms in major [[hospital]]s for treatment of victims of violent crimes that are staffed by physicians trained to deal with [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] victims, including victims of trafficking. WACPU also had referral agreements with two NGOs to provide victims of trauma with [[psychological counseling|counseling]] and legal services that were available to trafficking victims. The government subsidized some shelter facilities for victims of gender-based violence and the worst forms of child labor which may have unknowingly aided trafficked women and children. Officials began renovating 13 government-owned buildings, one in each region, to be used as shelters for women and child victims of gender-based violence and human trafficking, but these facilities would most likely not provide services for men. The [[Judicial system of Namibia|Namibian legal system]] provided protection to victims who wish to testify against their abusers, as well as a legal alternative to foreign victims' removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution through provisions in other laws. Official understanding of what constitutes human trafficking remained limited, and it is possible that trafficking victims were jailed or [[prosecution|prosecuted]] for violating laws related to [[immigration]] and prostitution before they were identified as victims.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Namibian government made efforts during the year to raise awareness of trafficking throughout the country. The government conducted a media campaign against gender-based violence and trafficking, in which it encouraged victims and members of the public to report suspected trafficking offenders and assist in investigations and prosecutions. Fewer WACPU and MGECW officials received training to identify victims of trafficking in the reporting period than in previous years. The government did not provide specific training on identifying and assisting Namibian trafficking victims overseas to diplomats, but continued to encourage them to maintain relations with NGOs that follow trafficking issues. During the year, the Ministry of Home Affairs forged a partnership with [[UNICEF]] to open offices at hospitals and deploy mobile units throughout the country to provide [[birth certificate]]s for newborns and identity documents for orphans and vulnerable children. The government made no discernible efforts to reduce the demand for [[commercial sex acts]] during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

{{NPOV|date=October 2018}}
[[Crime]]s are committed against and by [[Immigration to Germany|immigrants in Germany]]. Crimes by foreigners (German: ''Ausländerkriminalität'') has been a longstanding theme in public debates in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/827947231|title=Challenging multiculturalism : European models of diversity|last=|first=|date=2013|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|others=Taras, Ray, 1946-|year=|isbn=9780748664597|location=Edinburgh|pages=172|oclc=827947231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Guest worker" era in the 1950s-1980s==

The {{ill|Ausländergesetz (Deutschland)|de}} (Foreigners Act) of 1965 attempted to control immigration to West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/migration-citizenship/germany.php#_ftn22|author=Jenny Gesley|title=Germany: The Development of Migration and Citizenship Law in Postwar Germany|website=The Law Library of Congress|date=March 2017|access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s, a group known as [[Gastarbeiter]] participated in an organised immigration programme to the former [[West Germany]] because of labour shortages in the country.  The former [[East Germany]] also had labour shortages but their "guest worker" programme tended to encourage immigration from other socialist and communist countries. Many former "guest workers" became German citizens. The first generation of "guest workers" did not have an elevated crime rate, second- and third-generation immigrants studied in the 1970s and 1980s had higher crime rates than their German contemporaries who were not from an immigrant background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsf.uni-greifswald.de/fileadmin/mediapool/lehrstuehle/harrendorf/Germany_youngMig.pdf|title=Migration and ethnic minorities in Germany: impacts on youth crime, juvenile justice and youth imprisonment|last=Dünkel|first=Frieder|date=|website=|publisher=[[University of Greifswald]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128113053/https://www.rsf.uni-greifswald.de/fileadmin/mediapool/lehrstuehle/harrendorf/Germany_youngMig.pdf|archive-date=28 January 2016|dead-url=yes|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1991 [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] study covering the preceding two decades found that crime rates were higher among immigrants with a strongly different cultural background from Germans. Under the guest worker programme, Turks and Yugoslavs had far higher crime rates than Spaniards and Portuguese, while the highest crime rates were recorded among individuals from [[Third World|third world]] countries. For third world countries, the immigrants were first generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/6554/index.html|title=Ausländerkriminalität in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (PDF download)|last=Heinz|first=Schöch,|last2=Michael|first2=Gebauer,|date=1991-01-01|website=epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de|publisher=Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München|page=56|language=de|doi=10.5282/ubm/epub.6554|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal activity by immigrants since the 1990s==
Studies in the 1990s showed a correlation between immigrant populations in Germany and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, Wesley D. "Ausländer Raus? The Empirical Relationship between Immigration and Crime in Germany." Social Science Quarterly 78, no. 2 (1997): 543-58. https://www.jstor.org/stable/42864353.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The 1999 bill making naturalisation of immigrants contingent upon a written declaration that the applicant was loyal to the Constitution, competent in German language, not dependent on welfare and had no criminal record was the first piece of legislation to mention crime in relation to immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=13 January 1999|title=Einbuergerungsbewerber muessen verfassungstreu sein|journal=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|language=de|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/45670330.pdf|title=The Domestic Legal Sources of Immigrant Rights: The United States, Germany, and the European Union|author=Christian Joppke|year=1999|website=European University Institute, Florence (EUI Working Paper SPS No. 99/3)|access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in the early 2000s tended to show little correlation between migrants and crime in Germany.&lt;ref name="HornFears"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horn|first1=Heather|title=Where Does Fear of Refugees Come From?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/04/refugees-crime-rumors/480171/|accessdate=25 July 2016|publisher=The Atlantic|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CrimeNotIncreased"&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: refugees have not increased crime rate in Germany|url=http://www.dw.com/en/report-refugees-have-not-increased-crime-rate-in-germany/a-18848890|accessdate=25 July 2016|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the start of 2015 to the end of 2017, {{Val|1356600}} asylum seekers were registered in total.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to a 2018 study by German criminologists, the crime rate of non-Germans between the ages of 16 and 30 is within the same range as that of Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Feltes|first=Thomas|title=More Refugees, More Offenders, More Crime?

In May 2016, U.S. fact-checker [[PolitiFact.com|Politifact]] noted that 2016 data suggest that the crime rate of the average refugee is lower than that of the average German.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-germany-now-riddled-crime-thanks/|title=Donald Trump says Germany now riddled with crime thanks to refugees|website=@politifact|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the interior ministry's report "Criminality in context with immigration" (German: ''Kriminalität im Kontext von Zuwanderung'') &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/JahresberichteUndLagebilder/KriminalitaetImKontextVonZuwanderung/KriminalitaetImKontextVonZuwanderung_2017.pdf;jsessionid=3A0357445A988BC24E4C701B5B8E6563.live2292?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3|title=Kriminalität im Kontext von Zuwanderung - Bundeslagebild 2017|last=|first=|date=2018|website=BKA|page=55, 61|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time summarized and singled out all people who entered Germany via the asylum system. The group called "immigrants" includes all asylum seekers, tolerated people, "unauthorized residents" and all those entitled to protection (subsidiary protected, contingent refugees and refugees under the Geneva Convention and asylum). The group represented roughly 2 percent of the German population by end of 2017&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article175907770/Kriminalstatistik-Bayern-ist-das-sicherste-Bundesland.html?wtrid=onsite.onsitesearch|title=Zuwanderer in einigen Kriminalitätsfeldern besonders auffällig|last=|first=|date=|website=Die Welt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but was suspected of committing 8.5 percent of crimes (violations off the German alien law are not included). The numbers suggest that the differences could at least to some extent have to do with the fact that the refugees are younger and more often male than the average German. The statistics show that the asylum-group is highly overrepresented for some types of crime. They account for 14.3 percent of all suspects in crimes against life (which include murder, manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter), 12.2 percent of sexual offences, 11.4 percent of thefts and 9.7 percent of body injuries The report also shows differences between the origin of migrants. Syrians are underrepresented as suspects, whereas citizens from most African countries, especially northern Africans are strongly overerrepresented. Afghans and Pakistani are particularly overerrepresented at sexual offenses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

From 2015 to 2016, the number of suspected crimes by refugees, asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants increased by 50 percent.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/25/migrant-crime-germany-rises-50-per-cent-new-figures-show/&lt;/ref&gt; The figures showed that most of the suspected crimes were by repeat offenders, and that 1 percent of migrants accounted for 40 percent of total migrant crimes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; From 2016 to 2017, the number of crimes committed by refugees, asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants in Germany decreased by 40 percent, which was mostly caused by significantly less violations off the alien law, because far fewer asylum seekers entered the county in this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article175679108/Polizei-Statistik-Kriminalitaet-geht-in-Deutschland-so-stark-zurueck-wie-seit-1993-nicht.html|title=Kriminalität geht in Deutschland so stark zurück wie seit 1993 nicht|last=|first=|date=|website=Die Welt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first comprehensive study of the social effects of the one million refugees going to Germany found that it caused "very small increases in crime in particular with respect to drug offenses and fare-dodging."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/901076/what-effect-did-the-record-influx-of-refugees-have-on-jobs-and-crime-in-germany-not-much/|title=What effect did the record influx of refugees have on jobs and crime in Germany?

Sex crimes made for less than 1 percent of all crimes committed by refugees, while homicide registered the smallest fraction at 0,1 percent."&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; According to the conservative newspaper [[Die Welt]]'s description of the report, the most common crime committed by refugees was not paying fares on public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;13.11.15 Straftaten "im sehr niedrigen sechsstelligen Bereich", Die Welt, https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article148812603/Straftaten-im-sehr-niedrigen-sechsstelligen-Bereich.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deutsche Welle's reporting in February 2016 of a report by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, the number of crimes committed by refugees did not rise in proportion to the number of refugees between 2014-2015.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/report-refugee-related-crimes-in-germany-increase-less-than-influx-of-asylum-seekers/a-19053227|title=Report: Refugee-related crimes in Germany increase less than influx of asylum seekers {{!}} NRS-Import {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 17.02.2016|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deutsche Welle, "between 2014 and 2015, the number of crimes committed by refugees increased by 79 percent. Over the same period, the number of refugees in Germany increased by 440 percent."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

[[Deutsche Welle|DW]] reported in 2006 that in Berlin, young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their German peers.&lt;ref name="dw_1953916"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1953916,00.html|title=Identifying the Roots of Immigrant Crime|work=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Whereas the [[Gastarbeiter]] in the 50s and 60s did not have an elevated crime rate, second- and third-generation of immigrants had significantly higher crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsf.uni-greifswald.de/fileadmin/mediapool/lehrstuehle/harrendorf/Germany_youngMig.pdf|title=Migration and ethnic minorities in Germany: impacts on youth crime, juvenile justice and youth imprisonment|last=Dünkel|first=Frieder|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128113053/https://www.rsf.uni-greifswald.de/fileadmin/mediapool/lehrstuehle/harrendorf/Germany_youngMig.pdf|archive-date=28 January 2016|dead-url=yes|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in the ''[[European Economic Review]]'' found that the immigration of more than 3 million people of German descent to Germany after the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a significant increase in crime.&lt;ref name=":352"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piopiunik|first=Marc|last2=Ruhose|first2=Jens|title=Immigration, regional conditions, and crime: evidence from an allocation policy in Germany|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292116302252|journal=European Economic Review|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects were strongest in regions with high unemployment, high preexisting crime levels or large shares of foreigners.&lt;ref name=":352" /&gt;

''[[The Independent]]'' reported that  in 2017 crime in  Germany was at its lowest for 30 years, and that crimes by non-Germans had fallen by 23% to just over 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/donald-trump-germany-crime-rate-immigrants-migrants-refugees-a8404786.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the [[The Wall Street Journal|''Wall Street Journal'']] analysed German crime statistics for crime suspects and found that the  foreigners, overall 12.8% of the population, make up a disproportionate share of crime suspects (34.7%), see horizontal bar chart.&lt;ref name="wsj20181016"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ethnic-crime-families-provoke-german-crackdown-1539604801|title=An Ice-Cream Truck Slaying, Party Drugs and Real-Estate Kings: Ethnic Clans Clash in Berlin’s Underworld|last=Pancevski|first=Bojan|date=2018-10-15|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 2010s most organized crime in Germany was committed by citizens of other countries.&lt;ref name="PancevskiGermany"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pancevski |first1=Bojan |title=Ethnic Clans Clash in Berlin’s Underworld; Criminal clans of Arab and Kurdish origin fight violently in Berlin and broaden their sway in Germany |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ethnic-crime-families-provoke-german-crackdown-1539604801 |accessdate=15 October 2018 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In  2017 proportion of non-German citizen suspects increased from 67.5% to 70.7% while the proportion of German citizens decreased correspondingly.&lt;ref name="bka_ok_2017_p13"/&gt;  For the German citizens, 14.9% had a different citizenship at birth.&lt;ref name="bka_ok_2017_p13"/&gt; 

For several types of crime and drug crime in particular, organised crime gangs were dominated by people from countries with high rates of immigration to Germany.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2017, the most common nationality of foreign organized crime gangs was Albanian with 21 gangs, the great majority of which were active in drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2017 there were 13 identified Serbian organized crime gangs, active in drug crime, property crime and violent crime.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2017 there were 12 [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar]] gangs, active in property crime, drug trade and forgeries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Syrian gangs were active in drug trade and drug smuggling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

Arab and Kurdish organized crime gangs have their roots in asylum seekers who arrived beginning in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="PancevskiGermany"/&gt;  In the 1980s thousands of Arabs and Kurds from districts of Lebanon and Turkey, significant portions of whome were [[Statelessness|stateless]], sought asylum in Germany. Unlike the earlier guest workers, were allowed to work but instead received social benefits and often did not integrate into German society. Some of the arrived families instead relied on tribal and [[Islam in Germany|Islamic codes of justice]].&lt;ref name="wsj20181016" /&gt; Groups of extended Arab and Kurdish families centered in Berlin are active in selling illegal drugs and running illegal prostitution, but have invested in legal businesses including real estate, fitness studios, gambling and restaurants.&lt;ref name="PancevskiGermany"/&gt;  They exploit asylum  seekers who arrived in the European migrant crisis of 2015-2016, employing them as streetcorner durg dealers.&lt;ref name="PancevskiGermany"/&gt;

In 2017, 16 Nigerian crime gangs were active in illegal immigration (German: ''Schleuserkriminalität'') drug crime and other offenses in the night life scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/JahresberichteUndLagebilder/OrganisierteKriminalitaet/organisierteKriminalitaetBundeslagebild2017.html;jsessionid=A99EC3231788A672D2AEA397F21B1FEC.live2302?nn=27988|title=BKA  -  Bundeslagebilder Organisierte Kriminalität - Bundeslagebild Organisierte Kriminalität 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bka.de|page=16|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an opinion piece in the ''[[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]]'' in September 2018, the political scientist {{ill|Ralph Ghadban|de}} argued that federal authorities had refused to recognise the specific problem of organized crime gangs based on family ties and ethnicity ({{lang-de|Clankriminalität}}), subsuming it under "organised crime" and that, encouraged by the success of the Arab clans, families from other ethnic groups, including Chechens, Albanians, and Kosovars were developing similar structures. According to Ghadban, these structures present a threat to liberal, individualised societies because they hinder integration. A modern society, he says, only functions when people voluntarily follow its rules, but clan members consider themselves members of a family rather than citizens of a country, and do not submit to the rule of law, regarding individuals who do so as weak and unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/aussenansicht-die-macht-der-clans-1.4147228|title=Die Macht der Clans |last=Ghadban |first=Ralph |date=28 September 2018 |website=sueddeutsche.de |access-date=1 October 2018|language=de|issn=0174-4917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Wall Street Journal, the ethnic crime clans represent both a security threat as well as an example of what can happen when integration of immigrants fail.&lt;ref name="wsj20181016" /&gt;

=== Honor killings ===
Investigating criminal records for partner homicides from the years 1996-2005 period, the BKA concluded that there were about 12 cases of honour killings in Germany per year, including cases involving collective [[family honor]] and individual male honor, out of an average about 700 annual homicides. An accompanied study of all homicides in Baden-Württemberg show that men from Turkey, Yugoslavia and Albania have a between three and fime times overrepresentation for partner homicides, both honor and non-honor releated. The causes for the higher rate was given as low education and social status of these groups along with cultural traditions of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/765999746|title=Ehrenmorde in Deutschland 1996-2005 eine Untersuchung auf der Basis von Prozessakten|last=1963-|first=Oberwittler, Dietrich|date=2011|publisher=Luchterhand|others=Kasselt, Julia 1980-, Bundeskriminalamt|year=|isbn=9783472080459|location=Köln|page=172-173|pages=|oclc=765999746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gang rape ===
After the gang rapes where immigrants were suspect in [[2018 Freiburg gang rape|Freiburg]], Munich and Velbert, an overview of police gang rape statistics in the 2010s was published by [[Tagesschau (German TV series)|Tagesschau]] in 2018. The profile of the suspects and convicted fit that of sex crime in general as they were almost all male. Additionally foreign{{clarify |date=November 2018 |reason="foreign" requires definition}} perpetrators were overrepresented compared to their share of the overall population in Germany. The absolute number of gang rapes were not increasing, but the proportion of foreign{{clarify |date=November 2018 |reason="foreign" requires definition}} suspects rose and the proportion of Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi suspects rose. One reason cited for the increase was that these demographics have larger proportions of young males, which are inherently overrepresented for crime.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://faktenfinder.tagesschau.de/inland/gruppenvergewaltigungen-101.html|title=Wie viele Gruppenvergewaltigungen gibt es?|last=tagesschau.de|website=tagesschau.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of assault gang rapes were significantly higher in periods prior to 2015 and the [[European migrant crisis]], with the exception of 2016 where the [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany]] nearly doubled the number of cases. In 2017 there were 122 cases, the fewest since the [[German reunification]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== By region ==
=== Baden-Württemberg ===
Knife attacks strongly rose in the state [[Baden-Württemberg]] from 3,858 in 2013 to 4,874 in 2017. The number of suspects of knife attacks who were asylum seekers rose from 220 in 2013 to 898 in 2017. As a reaction to these figures, Interior Minister [[Thomas Strobl]] (CDU) asked other [[States of Germany|German federal states]] to record knife attacks in their crime statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/kriminalitaet/messerattacke-mitten-in-ravensburg-15812626.html Messerangriff mitten in Ravensburg], Frankfurter Allgemeine, 29 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bavaria ===
The state [[Bavaria]] has registered the number of crimes with at least one foreign suspect since 2009. In 2009 there were 5506 such cases, there was an increased to 13 203 crimes in 2014 and in 2016 there were 36 027 such cases. The official Bavarian indirectly attributes the increase to the migration policy of the federal government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Berlin ===

[[Deutsche Welle|DW]] reported in 2006 that in Berlin, young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their German peers, although it noted that violent crime was a rare problem in the western German city of Duisburg, where the immigrant population is just as large as it is Berlin.&lt;ref name="dw_1953916"/&gt;

In the 90s, police in the Berlin district [[Neukölln]] raised concerns about a dozen Lebanese-[[Kurds in Germany|kurdish]] families, but their concerns were rebutted with the families being war refugees and they would some day return to their home countries. In 2011, of the 25 Arab extended families (German: ''Großfamilien'') in Berlin, six were heavily involved in crime. According to a migration official in Neukölln, of the 204 young repeat offenders, half had an Arab name.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.4979|title=Arabische Kriminelle in Deutschland: Das regeln wir unter uns|last=Schaaf|first=Julia|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-08-31|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later turned out not to be the case. In Berlin, [[Clan|clans]] of Arab descent have organised parallel societies in Berlin and Bremen where they sustain themselves by crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article174164559/Arabische-Grossfamilien-Null-Toleranz-Strategie-soll-kriminelle-Clans-zerschlagen.html|title=Arabische Großfamilien: Null-Toleranz-Strategie soll kriminelle Clans zerschlagen|last=Büscher|first=Wolfgang|date=2018-03-04|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article171895316/Berlin-befreit-Strassen-von-Schutzgeld-Erpressungen-Ergeben-uns-nicht.html|title=Berlin befreit Straßen von Schutzgeld-Erpressungen – „Ergeben uns nicht“|last=WELT|date=2017-12-25|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article154174175/Berlins-Unterwelt-ist-verloren-an-die-arabischen-Clans.html|title=Organisiertes Verbrechen: In Berlin regieren arabische Clans|last=Behrendt|first=Michael|date=2016-04-10|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/polizei/20-grossfamilien-in-berlin-clans-haben-die-strassen-aufgeteilt-30986292|title=20 Großfamilien in Berlin: Clans haben die Straßen aufgeteilt|last=Schmalz|first=Alexander|work=Berliner Zeitung|access-date=2018-07-21|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Berlin, 20 extended families with each having up to 500 members are established according to estimates of the police, but not all family members are involved in crime. According to the [[Landeskriminalamt]], a third of a all court proceedings against organized crime concerns members of the clans. About half of the clan suspects had a German passport.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In July 2018, 77 real estate properties to a value of 10 millon euro were confiscated from Arab clan "R" by the authorities as they had been purchased with funds earned by crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/polizei/sogar-kleingartenkolonie-dabei-polizei-beschlagnahmt-77-immobilien-von-arabischem-clan-30982382|title=Sogar Kleingartenkolonie dabei: Polizei beschlagnahmt 77 Immobilien von arabischem Clan|work=Berliner Zeitung|access-date=2018-08-22|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sample of the 3930 prison population of Berlin 31 March 2018, 51% had no German citizenship. Of the individuals in [[Remand (detention)|pre-trial detention]] facilities, 75% had foreign nationality. Individuals from 90 different countries serve sentences in Berlin prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article215445013/Berliner-Gefaengnisse-Inhaftierte-aus-mehr-als-90-Laendern.html?__pwh=t2MKuWKS2gD4kP8ty/Ejlw==|title=Berliner Gefängnisse: Inhaftierte aus mehr als 90 Ländern|last=Berlin|first=Berliner Morgenpost -|access-date=2018-10-02|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bremen ===
According to the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', of the 2600 "[[Mhallami]]-Kurds" (German: ''Mhallamiye-Kurden'') 1100 have been indicted for crime in court. This term makes it clear that the controversial Arab families originated in the [[Turkish Kurdistan|Kurdish areas of Turkey]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The families are noted for their readiness to use violence and attendands threats thereof, which according to police goes beyond mere crime, but serves as a display of power to the surroundings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia ===
By 2018, crime by ethnically diverse groups (German: ''Clankriminalität'') had taken on proportions which necessitated a response from authorities so two prosecutors were tasked with counter-acting such crime. According to Horst Bien, chief of the [[public prosecutor's office]] there are about 70 extended families (German: ''Großfamilien'') of Turkish, Kurdish and Arab descent with about 2800 members. All members of the 70 clans are not involved, predominantly male members are prevalent in judicial proceedings. Commonly the charges involve grievous bodily harm, robbery, extortion and narcotics trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dzonline.de/NRW/3356064-Justiz-Zwei-Sonder-Staatsanwaelte-kaempfen-gegen-Clankriminalitaet|title=Zwei Sonder-Staatsanwälte kämpfen gegen Clankriminalität|last=|first=|date=22 June 2018|work=Dülmener Zeitung|access-date=|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamburg ===
[[Hamburg]] police reported criminal proceedings being opened against 38,000 people in the first six months of 2016, of which 16,600 persons or 43% of the defendants had no German papers. This represents a rise from 41% of defendants without German papers in 2015.&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt; The number of foreign criminals increased by 16.7% over 2015; 9.5% of the suspects were refugees. The figures did not include crimes against the German alien law. Foreign crime gangs were named as one reason for the rising figures. Refugees committed mostly pickpocketing, representing 30.6% of all suspects. 27.5% of suspects in drug dealing also arrived as refugees. Another common crime committed by refugees was bodily injury, with 1,014 cases reported, mostly in the asylum centers.&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/polizeimeldungen/article208273151/Auslaender-Kriminalitaet-in-Hamburg-Die-Zahlen-der-Polizei.html|title=Ausländer-Kriminalität in Hamburg: Die Zahlen der Polizei|trans-title=Foreign crime in Hamburg: The figures of the police|work=Hamburger Abendblatt|date=21 September 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saxony ===
On 5 December 2016, the Interior Minister of [[Saxony]], [[Markus Ulbig]], released figures about foreign criminals in the state from January to September. A large proportion of them came from [[North Africa]]; 664 North Africans were responsible for 36% of all 14,043 crimes committed by immigrants.&lt;ref name="bild" /&gt; By the end of October 2016, 31,000 asylum seekers resided in Saxony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sz-online.de/sachsen/innenminister-ulbig-stellt-lagebericht-asyl-und-kriminalitaetsentwicklung-zuwanderer-vor-3556831.html|title=Innenminister Ulbig stellt "Lagebericht Asyl und Kriminalitätsentwicklung Zuwanderer" vor|trans-title=Minister of the Interior Ulbig presents 'Situation Report on Asylum and the Development of Crime Migrants'|work=Sächsische Zeitung|date=5 December 2016|accessdate=6 December 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, in Saxony 7,579 immigrants were perpetrators, counting only solved cases. 5,288 of the crimes were theft and robbery; 2,214 were bodily injury; and 169 were sexual assaults, representing a rise from 25 recorded cases in 2013.&lt;ref name="bild"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/regional/dresden/gewalt/169-sexualstraftaten-durch-zuwanderer-49085760.bild.html|title=169 Sexual-Straftaten durch Zuwanderer!|trans-title=169 Sexual offenses by immigrants!|work=Bild.de|date=5 December 2016|accessdate=6 December 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
=== Lower Saxony ===
A 2018 study showed that in [[Lower Saxony]], chosen by the researches because of its typicality, reported violent crime increased by 10.4% in  2015 and 2016, with 92.1% of the increase was attributable to migrants.&lt;ref name="CrimeRiseBBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany: Migrants 'may have fuelled violent crime rise' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42557828 |accessdate=19 June 2018 |publisher=BBC |date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blade weapon crimes==
According to the police union, the German government does not keep a record of knife and blade related crimes as a distinct type of crime. The German Police Trade Union ([[Deutsche Polizeigewerkschaft|DPoIG]]) has highlighted the issue and has sought that carrying a knife—which its members highlights involve "noticeably" young migrants — be prosecuted under attempted murder provisions in Germany, and urged government to compile statistics nationwide on knife incidents.&lt;ref name="PoliceUnions"&gt;{{cite news|title=Youth knifing spate alarms German police unions|url=http://www.dw.com/en/youth-knifing-spate-alarms-german-police-unions/a-43225871|accessdate=16 April 2018|publisher=Deutshe Welle|date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of prominent incidents involving knives led to the issue becoming a political issue. These include incidents where an attacker murdered their partner such as the [[2017 Kandel stabbing attack]], the [[Reutlingen knife attack]], the [[2018 Hamburg stabbing attack]] where a 33 year old from [[Niger]] (who arrived to Germany in 2013) stabbed and killed his ex-wife and daughter, as well as incidents like the [[2018 Burgwedel stabbing]] where a 17 year old Syrian who had arrived to Germany in 2003 stabbed and injured a woman following a brawl between two youths in a supermarket, the 2018 [[Flensburg stabbing incident]] where a 24 year old [[Eritrea]]n refugee who arrived in Germany in September 2015 was shot and killed after stabbing a police woman with a kitchen knife, and the 2017 [[Siegaue rape case]] where a 31 year old [[Ghana]]ian used a [[Machete]] in an attack where a victim was [[Rape in Germany|raped]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article174531715/Flensburg-17-Jaehrige-erstochen-Tatverdaechtiger-aus-Afghanistan.html|title=Flensburg: 17-Jährige erstochen – Tatverdächtiger aus Afghanistan|last=WELT|date=2018-03-14|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelocal.de/20180327/string-of-knife-attacks-further-fuels-debate-over-refugees-and-violence String of knife attacks further fuels debate over refugees and violence], The Local, 27 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=S.

==Crimes against immigrants since the 1990s==
The long history of [[Turks in Germany|Turkish immigration to Germany]] resulted in Turkish immigrant families becoming one of the largest ethnic minorities in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Esra TÜRKEL |title='Sözünüzü Tutun'|url=http://www.starkibris.net/index.asp?haberID=125704|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated at between 2.5 and 4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=German Missions in the United States|title=Immigration and Cultural Issues between Germany and its Turkish Population Remain Complex|url=http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/10__Press__Media/03__Trips/2011/Nachwuchs__2011/Domfeh__S.html|quote=With a population of roughly 4 million within Germany's borders, Turks make up Germany's largest minority demographic.|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a third of these still hold Turkish citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/why-german-turks-are-numerous-divided-and-bitter-748329|title=Why German Turks are numerous, divided and bitter|website=Handelsblatt Global|author=David Reay|date=April 13, 2017|access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 27 October 1991, [[Mete Ekşi]] ([[:de:Mete Ekşi|de]]), a 19-year-old student from [[Kreuzberg]], was attacked by three [[neo-Nazi]] German brothers.

In 1993, an arson attack against a Turkish household in the town of [[Solingen]] in North Rhine-Westphalia caused the deaths of five people. Ahead of a commemorative event in 2018, 25 years after the event, Turkey's Foreign Office noted that "racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia are on the rise" in Germany and a representative of the family who were attacked called for reconciliation. A spokesman for anti-right demonstrators at the commemoration said, "When you look at how the mood was back then and how it is turning again now, I believe it's important to rally in the streets and to speak out against it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20180529/25-years-on-tense-germany-and-turkey-mark-deadly-neo-nazi-attack|title=25 years on, tense Germany and Turkey mark deadly neo-Nazi attack|website=The Local.de|date=29 May 2018|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 study, there were 1,645 instances of anti-refugee violence and social unrest in Germany during the years 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benček|first=David|last2=Strasheim|first2=Julia|date=2016|title=Refugees welcome?

According to the German Federal Criminal Office, there were 797 attacks against residences of refugees or migrants from January to October 2016. 740 attacks had a right-wing background, which also couldn't be ruled out in 57 further cases. Of these, 320 cases of property damage were recorded, in 180 cases propaganda material was dispersed and in 137 cases violence was used. In addition, 61 incidents of arson as well as 10 violations of the Explosives Law, 4 of them in front of a residence of refugees, were registered. According to ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', there were also 11 cases of attempted murder or homicide. In 2015, there had been 1,029 attacks against refugee residences, following 199 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-10/asylunterkuenfte-angriffe-800-straftaten-fluechtlingsheime BKA zählt fast 800 Angriffe auf Flüchtlingsunterkünfte], Die Zeit, 19 October 2016, in German&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's interior ministry stated that 560 people, including 43 children, had been injured in such attacks during 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39096833|title=Germany hate crime: Nearly 10 attacks a day on migrants in 2016|date=26 February 2017|website=BBC|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to criminologist [[Simon Cottee]], sociologist [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] analyzed fear of immigrant crime among Germans and other contemporary Europeans in the 1960s as a form of [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name="CotteePanic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cottee|first1=Stanley|title=Europe's moral panic about the migrant Muslim 'other'|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-cottee-fear-of-refugees-20151013-story.html|accessdate=25 July 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four violent crimes committed during the week of 18 July 2016&amp;ndash;three of them, the [[Reutlingen knife attack]], [[2016 Ansbach bombing]], [[Würzburg train attack]], were committed by asylum seekers&amp;ndash;created significant political pressure for changes in the [[Angela Merkel]] administration policy of welcoming refugees.&lt;ref name="RefugeePolicy"&gt;{{cite news|title=German Refugee Policy Under Fire After a Week of Bloodshed|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729232222/http://www.nytimes.com:80/aponline/2016/07/25/world/europe/ap-eu-germany-merkels-migrant-troubles.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 July 2016|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The New York Times|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wall Street Journal]] reported that two notorious crimes committed by asylum seekers in consecutive weeks in December 2016 had added fuel to debates on immigration and surveillance in Germany.&lt;ref name="WSJ December 27 2016"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Anton |last1=Troianovski|title=New Berlin Crime Adds Fuel to German Debate Over Surveillance and Immigration|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-berlin-crime-adds-fuel-to-german-debate-over-surveillance-and-immigration-1482869776|accessdate=16 October 2018|work=The Wall Street Journal|quote=A week after a deadly terror attack at a Christmas market, another crime in the German capital is feeding a debate over how the country balances security and civil liberties. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Siegaue rape case]] as well as the [[2017 Kandel stabbing attack]], in which a migrant who had been denied refugee status but who had not been deported killed his 16-year-old ex-girlfriend, intensified the discussion about admitting migrants.&lt;ref name="BenholdTrial"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benhold|first1=Katrin|title=A Girl’s Killing Puts Germany’s Migration Policy on Trial|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/world/europe/germany-teen-murder-migrant.html?_r=0|accessdate=18 January 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5279">The '''Artois-Baillet Latour Foundation''' is a Belgian non-profit organization which was founded on 1 March 1974.

== History ==
[[File:CMCroce InBev.jpg|thumb|The 2013 prize is given by The [[Queen Mathilde of Belgium|Queen of the Belgians]] to [[Carlo M. Croce]]]]
The foundation was born  by the initiative of Count [[Alfred de Baillet Latour]], who was the Director of the Artois Breweries in [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]]. He was the last male heir of the old [[House of Baillet]], and was by motherside related to the [[House of Spoelberch]], who own the Artois Company. In 1995 the name was changed in ''Interbrew-Baillet Latour Foundation'' and in 2005, the name was changed to ''InBev-Baillet Latour Fund''. 

The Foundation wants to encourage and reward achievements of outstanding human value in the Arts and Sciences. It can do this by means of Prizes, or by any other means that the Foundation might deem appropriate.

==InBev-Baillet Latour Health Prize==
The Artois-Baillet Latour Health Prize was established in 1977 to be awarded periodically to recognize the merits of a person whose work has contributed prominently to the improvement of human health in the fields of metabolic disorders, infectious diseases, neurological diseases, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Since 2000 the prize has been awarded annually. Worth 250,000 euros, it is Belgium's major scientific prize. Since 2005, it has been known as the InBev-Baillet Latour Health Prize.

==History==

The idea to form an international federation of educational associations for workers was conceived during [[World War II]], at the annual conference of the [[United Kingdom]] Workers' Educational Association. In 1945 a conference for members of workers' educational organisations from a number of countries was held in London, where it was resolved to create an international coalition to support collaboration between organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100053278|title=UIA Open Yearbook - IFWEA History|last=|first=|date=|website=uia.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1947 the International Federation of Workers' Educational Associations (IFWEA) was officially launched at a conference in London where a formal constitution was adopted. Worker representatives from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden attended, while observers from Germany, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and the United States of America were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/tom.davies/IFWEA.html|title=Project on the Evolution of International Non-Governmental Organisations - City University, London|last=Davies|first=Dr Thomas Richard|date=10 June 2010|website=staff.city.ac.uk.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A President and Secretary General were elected, and an Executive Committee was appointed with regional representation. Representation is now regularly modified to reflect the  federation's membership.

Over the past 71 years membership of IFWEA has increased. {{As of|2018}}, IFWEA has affiliates in more than 30 countries including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Nepal, New Zealand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Philippines, India, Cambodia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Iceland, Finland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Belgium, Bolivia, Peru and the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100053278|title=Members - IFWEA|last=|first=|date=|website=uia.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFWEA helps new organisations, particularly in [[developing countries]], and provides a global space for worker educators to share resources and advance the role of trade unions and community struggles in the transformation of society. An important role is to facilitate information exchanges between members.

==Purpose==

The purpose of IFWEA is to “advance the education of the public with respect to the democratic labour movement; and to promote the carrying out of free and voluntary educational work, according to the principles of solidarity and cooperation, justice and equality, and democracy and freedom”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifwea.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=IFWEA - Our Motivation: Purpose and Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=ifwea.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The highest decision making assembly in IFWEA is the quadrennial International General Conference.  The General Secretary, President and Executive Committee are elected at this conference. The 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; IFWEA General Conference was held in Lima, Peru in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smlr.rutgers.edu/news/international-federation-workers-education-association-ifwea-22nd-international-conference|title=International Federation of Workers' Education Association (IFWEA) 22nd International Conference - Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations|last=|first=|date=|website=smlr.rutgers.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the IFWEA Secretariat is to stimulate the development of a democratic workers’ education movement, by providing contact between member organisations, assisting with the development of partnerships, and promoting best practice in educational design and delivery through the provision of education resources, web communication and learning events such as workshops, seminars and conferences. The IFWEA Secretariat was registered in Cape Town, South Africa in 2009, after the election of IFWEA General Secretary Sahra Ryklief in December 2007. Previously it had been registered in the UK with the Secretariat in Manchester, and prior to that, it was hosted by the AOF Norway, with the Secretariat in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://city-press.news24.com/Careers/Winning-Women-Sahra-Ryklief-Creating-the-doers-of-tomorrow-20151108|title=City Press/News24 - Sahra Ryklief interview|last=|first=|date=|work=city-press.news24.com|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archival records of IFWEA 1945 to 1986 are held at the Trades Union Congress (TUC) Library Collections and University Archives at London Metropolitan University, reference code GB 1924 IFWEA. Current records are held at the Institute of The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.socialhistory.org/Record/ARCH00636|title=Collection Summary: International Federation of Workers' Educational Associations Archives|website=search.socialhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceived in late 1977 and carried out during his reign, the programme came in response to an upsurge in Islamic activism, and the problems and controversies associated with the policies of Zia's predecessor, Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].  Zia's stated intention was to "eradicate the scourge of interest" on loans and securities,&lt;ref name=wwics&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hathaway |editor2-first=Wilson|editor2-last=Lee|editor1-first=Robert M.|title=ISLAMIZATION AND THE PAKISTANI ECONOMY|date=2006|publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center or Scholars|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/~/media/E49831A1165C49EBA902C83648F0CE36.pdf|chapter=Pakistan's Superior Courts and the Prohibition of Riba|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and create an "[[interest-free economy]]".&lt;ref name="Islamic Studies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehboob|first=Aurangzaib|title=Islamization of Economy|publisher=Islamic Studies|pages=682–686|url=http://67.199.47.101/economy/islamisation%20of%20economy.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012|format=PDF|chapter=Executive Initiative I|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 1, 1980, approximately 7,000 interest-free counters were opened at all the nationalized commercial banks, making Pakistan the first country in the [[Muslim world]] with [[Islamic banking]].&lt;ref name="Islamic Studies"/&gt;

However, in spite of the public support allegedly demonstrated for it (and other Islamisation policies) by the [[Pakistani Islamisation programme referendum, 1984|1984 Islamisation referendum]] and the programme's initial gains and success, it failed to achieve international targets and to meet commercial interactions with other major international banks.&lt;ref name="Islamic Studies"/&gt; Islamic activists were also displeased that Zia's ordinances and proclamations did not ban interest paying accounts.

Zia's successors were not as active in their pursuit of Islamisation.

Islamisation has continued through the efforts of the Islamic courts Zia created, including activists on the Shariat Appellate Bench of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]], although it was given a setback when the government of [[Pervez Musharraf]] came to power and pressured a number of activist judges to retire.&lt;ref name=wwics/&gt;

==History and background==

As a state created specifically for Muslims, Pakistan has long had Islamic activists advocating for more thorough Islamisation of that country, and specifically for the elimination of ''[[riba]]'' (defined as interest on loans). But the country has also had [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernist]]s and secularists in positions of influence and "generations of Muslim usage and custom supported by the [[fatwa]] of respected [[ulema]] that held low rates of interest to be acceptable, non-usurious, and not ''[[riba]]''", according to economist Feisal Khan.&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:79"&gt;[[Islamic economics in Pakistan#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.79&lt;/ref&gt;  Even [[Muhammad Iqbal|Allama Iqbal]] "the Thinker of Pakistan" (''Mufakkir-e-Pakistan'') "cited approvingly" the fact that Muslim princely states in India did not restrict modern banking or "attempt to impose some sort of `Islamic` concept of interest-free financial transactions."{{#tag:ref|in his Presidential Address to the annual meeting of the [[All-India Muslim League]] in 1930|group=Note}}&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:80"&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.80&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently enthusiasm for Islamisation has waxed and waned throughout Pakistan's history. It has been strong when "religious elements are in ascendancy", such as during partition, the 1977 Nizam-e-Mustafa movement, and during the rise in fundamentalist after 2000. At other times "only lip service" is paid to the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Asi, Anwar, "Towards Islamic banking system", 2002 (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nisar-6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shariqnisar.com/images/My_writings/Problems%20Faced%20With%20Islamic%20Banking%20%28Journal%20of%20West%20Asia%20Studies%20AMU%29.pdf|title=Contemporary Issues Facing Islamic Banking|website=shariqnisar.com|page=6|last1=Nisar|first1=Shariq|author-link=Nisar Shariq|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maududi and other Islamist hoped to make Pakistan "a new [[Medina]]" which would become "the leader of the Islamic world in the twentieth century, a laboratory where experiments in Islamic modernity would be successfully conducted en route' to ushering a new Islamic renaissance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhulipala|first=V.|date=2011|title="A nation state insufficiently imagined?

Ashraf Qureishi and [[Abul A'la Maududi]],  two of the pioneer theoreticians of Islamic banking, who preached that interest was riba, forbidden to Muslim, and "laid the foundations of current" Islamic Banking and Finance in the 1940, were from South Asia. (Maududi moved to Pakistan where he became an influential Islamist leader.)&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:2,60-64"&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: pp.2, 60-64&lt;/ref&gt; According to Feisal Khan, "South Asians in general and Pakistanis in particular are `over-represented`" among Islamic Banking "theorist and practitioners," and Pakistanis are "found in Islamic banks and financial firms throughout the [Persian] Gulf at all levels, from tellers to the boardroom."&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:2"&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 28 of Pakistan's 1956 Constitution called for the elimination of ''riba'' "as early as possible". The 1962 Constitution provided in the principles of policy that "usury" should be abolished. Similar provisions were found in the 1973 Constitution.&lt;ref name=wwics/&gt; In 1969 the state-sponsored advisory body known as the [[Council of Islamic Ideology]] (CII), declared that Pakistan's banking system was "fundamentally based upon ''riba''", and unanimously called for its elimination.&lt;ref name=wwics/&gt;

The mid and late 1970s were a time of Islamic revivalism throughout parts of the Muslim world, including Pakistan. Zia's predecessor, leftist Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] faced economic problems of [[stagflation]] and opposition to his programme of [[nationalization]] and [[land reform]]. In 1976 and 1977, vigorous opposition to Bhutto's policies united under the revivalist banner of ''Nizam-e-Mustafa''&lt;ref name=nasr-45&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasr|first1=Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr|title=Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, Oxford|isbn=0195096959|pages=45–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Rule of the [[Muhammad|prophet]]") and preached that establishing an Islamic state based on [[sharia]] law would bring a return to the justice and success of the early days of Islam when the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] ruled Muslims.&lt;ref name=Kepel-100&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|date=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|pages=100–101|edition=2006|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OLvTNk75hUoC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Nizam-e-Mustafa+sharia#v=onepage&amp;q=Nizam-e-Mustafa%20sharia&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 December 2014|isbn=9781845112578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than two years after the coup, Pakistan's [[Shia]] neighbor, Iran, saw a very unexpected [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] overthrow its well-financed pro-[[Western world|Western]], [[secular]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|monarchy]]. The new self-proclaimed revolutionary [[History of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]] believed in the necessity of Islamic sharia law for Islam to survive and prosper, and in the need to spread this doctrine to other Muslim states. While part of the Islamic revival, the revolution created a new conflict in the Islamic world by pitting revolutionary Shia Iran against its doctrinal and geopolitical rival the conservative [[Wahhabi]] [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], for leadership of the Islamic world. As poor, predominantly Sunni country, Pakistan has been [[Pakistan–Saudi Arabia relations|closely tied]] to the petroleum-exporting Saudi Arabia which has employed many [[Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia|Pakistani guest workers]]. This competition for influence affected many things in Muslim countries, including economic policies.

===Timeline of ''riba'' and banking===

*'''1956''' - first constitution of Pakistan states that the state was to "eliminate riba as early as possible" (article 29(f)), but does not define riba.&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:40"&gt;[[Islamic economics in Pakistan#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.40&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1969''' - the Council on Islamic Ideology recommends that riba be abolished and the banking system be overhauled, recommendation is ignored by the government.
*'''1971''' - the Council on Islamic Ideology recommends that riba be abolished and the banking system be overhauled, recommendation is also ignored by the government.
*'''1979''', July - interest is eliminated from three financial institutions by order of General Zia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ThirdWay|date=Sep 1985|publisher=Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern Ltd.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0MzBCQe32skC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=july+1979+zia+banks+pakistan#v=onepage&amp;q=july%201979%20zia%20banks%20pakistan&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective 1 July 1979, General Zia declared that the affairs of the National Investment Trust, the House Building Finance Corporation, and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan were to be run on an interest-free basis through the adoption of profit-loss sharing (PLS).
*'''1980''', detailed ''Report on the Elimination of Interest from the Economy 1980'', is issued by the Central Institute of Islamic Research at the request of ruling General Zia-ul-Haq.

*'''1991''', November - "monumental decision" by Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan overturning 20 federal and provincial financial laws as repugnant to Islam, forbids riba absolutely without exceptions. Tanzil-ur-Rehman having been brought out of retirement and appointed chief justice of the FSC,  rules the financial Islamisation of Zia inadequate.&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:7"/&gt;
*'''1999''' - decision upheld by Shariah Appellate Bench finding financial Islamisation of Zia inadequate.&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:7"&gt;[[Islamic economics in Pakistan#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.7&lt;/ref&gt; After much stalling by the government and bureaucracy, the Faisal case was upheld by the Shariah Appellate Bench of the Supreme court (SAB) in the Aslam Khaki decision, with detailed orders to start the interest free economy.
*'''1999''' - SAB gives Pakistan government an additional year to Islamise. Pleading that implementation of the judgment would "create enormous problems" for the domestic, western-style banking and the economy, as well as Pakistan's "official and private business and financial dealings with the outside world", the government was given an additional year to Islamise by the Bench.
*'''2002''', May 24 - SAB is reconstituted by new President General Pervez Musharraf. With one Islamist removed and two new ulema judges added by order of Musharraf.&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:123"&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies and difficulties==

Despite its success in initial first five years, the programme was fractured in many obvious reasons, and the stagflation again began to bite the country's resources, as well as many technical and scientific problems arise in the new economic system that the military government and Zia-ul-Haq himself was unable to solve.&lt;ref name="Joint Editor Islamic Economics Bulletin of India"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nisar, PhD|first=Dr. Professor Shariq|title=Problems in Islamization of Economy|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:KYi1klI0_AcJ:www.shariqnisar.com/images/My_writings/Problems%2520Faced%2520With%2520Islamic%2520Banking%2520%28Journal%2520of%2520West%2520Asia%2520Studies%2520AMU%29.pdf+Failure+of+Islamization+of+Economy+in+Pakistan&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj4K_ZYxvAPqHMGw_t_JEnXhLnHSzN2z9aOT9KeJo-L5j6q6vop8vK4Mxh8Dy3_6HcK7hjLsqfIOSvQ-ZRdNxOw_xjQRwW3iT3q3v647S8z-6KJVHY4Kshiro4DfsZ_srrwaNAw&amp;sig=AHIEtbRuP_84-ZsACZFj8vXHtnDI2e17zA|work=Dr. Sharif Nisar, PhD in Economics, is Joint Editor Islamic Economics Bulletin, India|publisher=Joint Editor Islamic Economics Bulletin of India|accessdate=13 August 2012|format=google docs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The newly elected, but technocratic government of Prime minister [[Mohammad Khan Junejo]] refused to pass the new and more stricter version of [[Sharia law|Sharia bill]].&lt;ref name="Library of Congress Country Studies"&gt;{{cite web|last=UG Govt.|first=United States Government|title=ZIA-UL-HAQ|url=http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/21.htm|work=This work is the copyright of the United States Government|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zia abruptly dismissed the government on May 29, 1988, and the dissolved [[Parliament of Pakistan|parliament]] the next day, alleging a slow pace of Islamization, corruption, deterioration of law and order, and mismanagement of the economy.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress Country Studies"/&gt;

===Banning ''Riba'', building Islamic banking===
General Zia declared that effective 1 July 1979 the affairs of the National Investment Trust, the House Building Finance Corporation, and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan were to be run on an interest-free basis through the adoption of [[profit and loss sharing]] finance (PLS).&lt;ref name=wwics/&gt;
On January 1, 1980, he appeared on [[Pakistan Television|national television]] and announced the introduction of a "Profit and Loss Sharing System", according to which account holders were to share the losses and profits of the bank.&lt;ref name="The Story of Pakistan: The Rules of Democracy"/&gt;

In 1980 the Council of Islamic Ideology issued a report with "detailed and far reaching reforms" to eliminate interest. The military government employed Islamic scholars and economists led by professor [[Khurshid Ahmad (Islamic scholar)|Khurshid Ahmad]] to compile laws about Islamic financing.&lt;ref name="The Story of Pakistan: The Rules of Democracy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Administration|title=Islamization Under General Zia-ul-Haq|url=http://storyofpakistan.com/islamization-under-general-zia-ul-haq/|work=June 1, 2003|publisher=The Story of Pakistan: The Rules of Democracy|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Zia's government responded to the council's report by replacing interest-bearing savings accounts with PLS instruments in Pakistan's five state banks. The government also introduced and encouraged such banks to adopt financing schemes based upon the principles of ''mudaraba'' and or ''musharaka.''&lt;ref name=wwics/&gt;

*''[[Murabaha]]'' is a practice in which the "lender" (usually a bank) purchases, in its own name, goods that the borrower (usually an importer or trader) wants, and then sells the goods to him at an agreed mark-up. The technique is used for financing trade, but because the bank takes title to the goods, and is therefore engaged in buying and selling, its profit derives from a real service and entails a degree, albeit minimal, of risk.&lt;ref name=wwics/&gt;
*''[[Musharaka]]'' is a practice in which the "lender" (usually a bank) enters into a partnership with the borrower/client in which both share the equity capital—and perhaps even management—of a project or deal, and both share in the profits or losses according to their equity shareholding.&lt;ref name=wwics/&gt;

However these Islamisation policies did not include a ban on interest-paying accounts and "in most instances" Pakistani banks continued to offer accounts with fixed interest rates.&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 128-9"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.128-9&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for term deposits, the banks substituted the phrases 'rate of interest' with 'expected [[rate of profit]]' and "kept the entire regime of interest-based deposits intact."&lt;ref name=WIWWIE2013:297&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.297&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Federal Shariat Court]] (FSC) — established by General Zia to, among other things, examine existing laws and strike down those that did not complied with Shari'a law {{#tag:ref|He also established a [[Supreme Court of Pakistan#Shariat Appellate Bench|Shariat Appellate Bench]] of the Supreme Court to be the final authority in Shariat cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Charles|others=Anis Ahmad, Author of introduction |title=Islamization of Laws and Economy, Case Studies on Pakistan|date=1996|publisher=Institute of Policy Studies, The Islamic Foundation|page=25|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}—would have been the way to put a stop to such interest-paying accounts, Zia had created an article in the constitution (203B) which specifically removed from the FSC's jurisdiction "fiscal law or any law relating to the levy and collection of taxes and fees or banking or insurance practice and procedure", until government deemed it appropriate to withdraw the ban.

Furthermore, after the death of general Zia-ul-Haq, this programme was neglected by his long-time opponent Prime minister Benazir Bhutto, while Zia ally [[Nawaz Sharif]] launched a twin intensified programme, [[Privatization in Pakistan|Privatization programme]] and the [[Economic liberalisation in Pakistan|economic liberalisation]] to promote the GDP growth rate as well as reverting the economy back to [[Western world|Westernized]] economic system.{{#tag:ref|See:the pages of [[Privatization in Pakistan|Privatization programme]] and the [[Economic liberalisation in Pakistan|economic liberalisation]]|group=Note}}

To surmount this obstacle, Islamic activists worked to&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 129-30"/&gt; 
#educate or convince the public that an interest-free economy was both viable and religiously necessary
#pass a bill to make the shariat "superordinate" to the constitution
#encourage superior courts to expand their definitions of jurisdiction of shariat to constitutional questions&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 129-30"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

;Education
Muslims agree that the Quran condemns ''Riba'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|275-8|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not all agree over what ''riba'' is.&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 130-31"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.130-1&lt;/ref&gt;

While Muslim activists (and most Pakistanis) agree that ''riba'' is interest on debt, others believe that ''riba'' is [[usury]] (unethical loans that unfairly enrich the lender) and not interest charged under state-regulated banking practices. Such people were to be found disproportionately among "the economists, bankers, politicians, and bureaucrats" who "would be responsible to administer an interest free system".&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 131"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

To convince these people and others, Jamat-e-Islami and like-minded groups have sponsored, and [[Saudi Arabia]] has financed, numerous symposia "dedicated to the task of defining the modalities of an interest-free economy." A "vibrant" and abundant literature has emanated from these conferences, but many mainstream economists have remained unpersuaded.&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 131"/&gt;  Activists also had no luck getting a law enacted to make the constitution subordinate to shariat, but had more luck in the courts.

;Superior Courts
While Zia had blocked the shariah courts ability to ban interest with Article 203B, he had also added Article 2A (also known as the [[Objectives Resolution]]) to the constitution, which included the statement that Muslims' lives should be ordered "in the individual and collective spheres in accordance with the teachings and requirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Quran and Sunnah."  One superior court judge&lt;ref&gt;in the [[Sindh High Court]] at the time&lt;/ref&gt; known as a particularly "skillful" Islamic activist and judicial activist -- [[Tanzil-ur-Rahman]]—argued that Article 2A required shariat law be enforced and was a "supra-Constitutional" ''[[Pure Theory of Law#.27Basic Norm .28Grundnorm.29.27|grund norm]]'' of law in Pakistan,&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 95"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.95&lt;/ref&gt; which meant that it gave superior courts jurisdiction to overrule parts of laws otherwise protected by the constitution if they are in violation of article 2-A, unless that court was specifically excluded.&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 132-3"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.132-3&lt;/ref&gt; (Article 203B specifically excluded the FSC from examining fiscal laws for repugnancy to Islam, but not the high courts.&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 132-3"/&gt;)
Several decisions handed down in the late 1980s and early 1990s supported Tanzil-ur-Rahman's interpretation,&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 99-100"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.99-100&lt;/ref&gt; but most high court justices did not subscribe to his application of the [[Objectives Resolution]], nor to a ban on interest, and Tanzil-ur-Rehman retired from the bench in 1990.

;Faisal Case

However, in 1990, the [[Benazir Bhutto]] government was dismissed by the president and Tanzil-ur-Rehman was brought out of retirement and appointed chief justice of the FSC. In November 1991 in a "monumental decision" he overturned 20 federal and provincial financial laws as repugnant to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Case: Mahmood-ur-Rehman Faisal vs. Secretary, Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 134-7"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.134-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision forbade ''riba'' absolutely without exceptions, defined it as "any addition, however slight, over and above the principal", including any system of markup, any indexing for [[inflation]], payment by value rather than kind. It forbid ''riba'' in "production loans" as well as "consumptive" loans. It specifically declared invalid two [[Islamic Modernist]] interpretations that avoided strict prohibition: considering anti-''riba'' Quranic verses (2:275-8) allegorical, and use of ''ijtihad''  (independent reasoning) of the issue based on finding the public good (''maslaha'').&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 135-6"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.135-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The government was publicly committed to Islamisation, but also pursuing a liberalization of Pakistan's economy and had a semi-autonomous state bank file an appeal. After much stalling by the government and bureaucracy, the Faisal case was upheld in 1999 by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan#Shariat Appellate Bench|Shariah Appellate Bench]] in the Aslam Khaki decision, with detailed orders to start the interest free economy.&lt;ref name=wwics/&gt;&lt;ref name=wblr-393&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Bank Legal Review|publisher=Walters Kluwer|page=393|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2utjpyTxGqMC&amp;pg=PA393&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=Aslam+Khaki+decision#v=onepage&amp;q=Aslam%20Khaki%20decision&amp;f=false |chapter=Islamic Law on Interest: 1999 Pakistan Supreme Court Ruling on Riba |accessdate=26 January 2015|isbn=9789041120014|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pleading that implementation of the judgment would "create enormous problems" for the domestic, western-style banking and the economy, as well as Pakistan's "official and private business and financial dealings with the outside world", the government was given an additional year to Islamise by the Bench.&lt;ref name="nisar-6"/&gt;

By this time, however, [[Pervez Musharraf]] had staged a coup and come to power and limited the power of the courts. He required judges to take a "fresh oath of office" in which they would undertake to uphold the "Provisional Constitution Order" established by the coup, which required judges to not "make any order against the Chief Executive or any other person exercising powers or jurisdiction under his authority."  Two justices of the Shariah Appellate Bench resigned rather than take the oath, a new appeal with new judges found many "errors" in the Aslam Khaki case and overturned the ruling of a couple months earlier.

;Aftermath

In Pakistan's financial sector, as of 2006, a system of Islamic banking has been adopted that operates in parallel with the conventional banking system. Pakistanis can choose between the two modes of financing. Most informed Pakistanis, however, insist that there is "no concerted move" to do away altogether with the conventional banking system, or to replace existing linkages and relationships with international financial markets.&lt;ref name="IPERH: 2"&gt;[[#IPERH|Hathaway, ''Islamization and the Pakistani Economy'', 2006]]: p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2014, the new "rebooted" Islamic banking sector made up 9.4% of Pakistan's banking assets,&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:130"&gt;[[Islamic economics in Pakistan#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: pp.130&lt;/ref&gt;  but like the old Islamic banking sector is still overwhelmingly based on markup, not profit and loss sharing.&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:131"&gt;[[Islamic economics in Pakistan#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: pp.131&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 the Faisal case decision that banned all interest on bank loans but was sent back to Federal Shariat Court (FSC) for "definitive finding on all the issues ..." in 2002 remains unheard in the Federal Shariat Court.&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:162"&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: pp.162&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic activists (such as M. Akram Khan), maintained that Islamic banking and economics had "effectively failed"&lt;ref&gt;Khan, M. Akram, "Islamic Banking in Pakistan: The Future Path", All Pakistan Islamic Education Congress, Lahore, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; because of lack of "political will",  ignorance of Islamic banking's "potential", the "inexperience" of the banking sector, failure to interest the public,&lt;ref&gt;Khan, M. Fahim, "Islamic Banking as Practiced now in the World" in Ahmad Ziauddin et al(ed.), Money and Banking in Islam, Institute of Policy Studies, Islamabad, Pakistan, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

;Studies of industry and customers

Critic and economist Feisal Khan has noted that the Islamic banking industry in Pakistan has been supply driven rather than demand driven (mandated by General Zia-ul-Haq, court rulings, and the State Bank of Pakistan, rather than by customer interest or popular movements).&lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:151&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.151&lt;/ref&gt; In series of interviews conducted in 2008 and 2010 with Pakistani banking professionals (banker in conventional and Islamic, Shariah banking advisors, finance-using businessmen, and management consultants), Khan noted many Islamic bankers expressed "cynicism" over the different or lack thereof between conventional and Islamic bank products,&lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:138,142&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.138, 142&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of requirements for external Shariah-compliance audits of Islamic banks in Pakistan,&lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:144&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.144&lt;/ref&gt; shariah boards lack of knowledge of un-shariah compliant practices in their banks or power to stop these practices.&lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:138-9&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.138-9&lt;/ref&gt;  However this did not deter patronage by the pious (one of whom explained that if his Islamic bank was not truly shariah compliant, 'The sin is on their head now, not on mine! What I could do, I've done.') &lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:146&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

One estimate of banking customer preference (given by a Pakistani banker) was that out of the entire Pakistani banking sector, was that about 10% of customers were "strictly conventional banking clients", 20% were strictly Shariah-compliant banking clients, and 70% would prefer Shariah-compliant banking but would use conventional banking if "there was a significant pricing difference".&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:138"&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: pp.138&lt;/ref&gt;  A survey of Islamic and conventional banking customers found  (unsurprisingly) Islamic banking customers were more observant (having attended [[hajj]], observing [[salat]], growing a beard, etc.), but also had higher savings account balances than conventional bank customers, were older, better educated, had traveled more overseas, and tended to have a second account at a conventional bank.{{#tag:ref|Survey of 5133 bank customers of 30 branches of an Islamic and a conventional bank led by Ayesha Khalid Khan&lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:147-9&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.147-9&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}  Another study, using "official data" reported to State Bank of Pakistan, found that for lenders who had taken out both Islamic ([[Murabaha]]) financing and conventional loans, the default rate was more than twice as high on the conventional loans. Borrowers were "less likely to default during [[Ramadan]] and in big cities if the share of votes to religious-political parties increases, suggesting that religion – either through individual piousness or network effects – may play a role in determining loan default."&lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:149-50&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p.149-50&lt;/ref&gt;

;Criticism
Other economists had different and more critical explanations and observations.  In 2000, the [[Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan|Governor]] of the [[State Bank of Pakistan]], [[Ishrat Hussain]] contended that "Pakistan is far removed from the day when it will be ready to adopt a full-fledged Islamic economic system. ... Most of the assumptions and premises on which the (scientific) [[hypotheses]] about the Islamic economic system have been constructed are serious flawed... "&lt;ref name="IPERH: 4"&gt;[[#IPERH|Hathaway, ''Islamization and the Pakistani Economy'', 2006]]: p.4&lt;/ref&gt;  A report by the IMF noted that the government has been unable to formulate non-interest based instruments for financing budget deficits, "thus the government, which is the major exponent of the implementation of the Islamic system, is forced to raise funds through borrowing on the basis of a fixed rate of return".&lt;ref name=nisar-7&gt;{{cite web|last1=NISAR|first1=SHARIQ|title=Contemporary Issues Facing Islamic Banking|url=http://www.shariqnisar.com/images/My_writings/Problems%20Faced%20With%20Islamic%20Banking%20%28Journal%20of%20West%20Asia%20Studies%20AMU%29.pdf|website=shariqnisar.com|accessdate=27 January 2015|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critic of "Islamization" of the economy, Feisal Khan, argues that one reason for the failure of the equity investment proposed by Islamic finance proponents to catch on is the "long established consensus" that debt finance is superior to equity investment because accurately determining the credit-worthiness of the borrower/investee is both time consuming and expensive, and much more crucial for equity investors than debt lenders. The quality and quantity of such information is particularly problematic when tax evasion is high and the underground economy large. This is very much the case in Pakistan where the 2005 incidence of tax evasion was between 5.7 and 6.5% of GDP, and the size of the unofficial/underground economy as between 54.6 and 62.8 percent of GDP,&lt;ref name="Kemal (2007: 28)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kemal |first1=M.A. |year=2007 |title=A Fresh Assessment of the Underground Economy and Tax Evasion in Pakistan: Causes, Consequences, and Linkages with the Formal Economy, | publisher=Pakistan Institute of Development Economics |series=PIDE Working Paper |page=28 |url=http://www.pide.org.pk/pdf/Working%20Paper/Working%20Paper%20No.%2013.pdf |accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "among the world's highest".&lt;ref name= FKIBP2015:99&gt;[[#FKIBP2015 |Khan,'' Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]], p.99&lt;/ref&gt; (The average size of the informal economy is about 30% in Asia.)&lt;ref name="Schneider 2006: 23, 24, 27"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneider |first1=F.| title=Shadow Economies and Corruption All Over the World: What Do We Really Know? |url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp2315.pdf |publisher=Institute for the Study of Labor, Discussion Paper #2315 |year=2006 |pages=23, 24, 27 |accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economist Izzud-Din Pal argues that "Islamising" the economy in Pakistan cannot be seen apart from the wider attempt of regimes and political elites with low levels of legitimacy and popularity to use religion to win public support.&lt;ref name="Yoginder Sikand"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yoginder Sikand|title=Failure of Islamisation in Pakistan [Book Review of ''Pakistan, Islam and Economics—Failure of Modernity'', by Izzud-Din Pal] |publisher= Oxford University |url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15112001/47.htm|work=Yoginder Sikand|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press, Karachi"/&gt;  Unfortunately, according to another author Yoginder Sikand, "rather than focusing on the Islamic imperatives of equality and social justice, which are so central to the Qur’anic text, successive regimes in Pakistan have sought to focus on particular economic injunctions of the Qur’an abstracted from wider issues of justice and equality".&lt;ref name="Yoginder Sikand"/&gt; Because the debate on  "Islamising" Pakistan's national economy has been reduced to issues related to interest-free banking, the abolition of ''riba'' (interest), the laws of inheritance and the levy of the "''zakāt''", Sikand believes all that is being offered are "magical solutions" to the complex modern problems of Pakistan's economy.&lt;ref name="Yoginder Sikand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press, Karachi"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cN7tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=9780195790689&amp;dq=9780195790689 |last1=Sikand, PhD |first1=Yoginder|title=Pakistan, Islam and Economics: Failure of Modernity |publisher=Oxford University Press, Karachi|location=Karachi, Sindh Province, Pakistan|isbn=978-0195790689|author2=Izzud-Din Pal |pages=195|chapter=Failure of Islamisation in Pakistan |date=September 23, 1999 |deadurl=no |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feisal Khan also argues that instituting a strictly Islamic banking system of ''mudaraba'' and ''musharaka,'' as called for by the 1999 Aslam Khaki decision of the Shariah Appellate Bench could lead to financial catastrophe.  If ''murabaha'' and other fixed income instruments were banned and replaced by the more "authentic" [[profit and loss sharing]], banks could only finance enterprise by taking "a direct equity state" as called for in ''mudaraba'' and ''musharaka.'' Credit would contract and [[central bank]]s would be unable to prevent a [[liquidity crisis]] by buying bonds, commercial paper, etc. to expand credit.&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:160-61"&gt;[[Islamic economics in Pakistan#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: pp.160-61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land reform and Islamisation===
{{further information|Agriculture in Pakistan#Land distribution and land reform|Feudalism in Pakistan}}
Land ownership is concentrated in Pakistan — as of 2015 a reported one-half of rural households in Pakistan are landless, while 5% of the country's population owns almost two-thirds of its farmland.{{#tag:ref|only 5 percent of the country's population owns almost two-thirds (64 percent) of its farmlands. ... about one-half (50.8 percent) of rural households are landless -- a direct result of a feudal system that has existed for centuries. ...

However, most provisions of these laws have been overruled as un-Islamic by Pakistan courts.&lt;ref name=lrip/&gt;&lt;ref name=kennedy-120/&gt;

The first attempts at [[land reform]] in Pakistan occurred under [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]]'s government in 1959, were successfully opposed by the landed elite who mobilized the Islamist party, [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]]  to defend the "sanctity of private property in Islam".&lt;ref name="Vali Nasr-93"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasr|first1=Vali  |editor1-last=Hathaway|editor1-first=Robert M |editor2-first=Wilson |editor2-last=Lee |title=ISLAMIZATION AND THE PAKISTANI ECONOMY|date=2004|publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|page=93|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/~/media/E49831A1165C49EBA902C83648F0CE36.pdf|accessdate=30 January 2015 |chapter= Islamization, the State and Development |quote=Throughout the 1950s, the landed elite resisted attempts at land reform by mobilizing religious support for its position. The Islamist party, Jama’ati Islami (the Islamic Party), helped galvanize support for the landed elite by underscoring the sanctity of private property in Islam. The alliance was able to undo the government's plans.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 when [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and the [[Pakistan People's Party]] came to power, land reforms were "at the center" of that government's plans to transform Pakistan in to a "democratic Islamic socialist" state. The regime issued two land reform laws. A 1972 law (Martial Law Regulation - MLR 115, "promlogated" by the prime minister rather than passed by the National Assembly) was designed to place ceilings on the agricultural holding of Pakistan's large landlords (usually 150 acres but 300 acres if the land was unirrigated; exceptions were granted for tractors or installed tubewells&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 122"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.122&lt;/ref&gt;). Land was to be seized by the state without compensation and distributed to the landless.&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 109"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Another provision of the law gave "first right of pre-emption" (right of first refusal to buy the land) to the existing tenants. In 1977, a bill was passed by the National Assembly, reducing the ceiling still further to 100 acres—although this act provided for compensation to landlords.&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 109"/&gt;

The implementation of land reforms was criticized&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 110"/&gt; for the modest amount of land seized and redistributed to the peasants, less-than-equitable administration—implementation was much more robust in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|NWFP]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], where opposition to Bhutto was centered—and for being inherently "un-Islamic".&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 110"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.110&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Pakistan's large landlords mobilized against the reforms which they saw as "a direct challenged to their long-standing interest in maintaining political control in Pakistan's rural areas".

;Undoing
After Ali Bhutto was overthrown, landlords who had lost as a result of land reform appealed to "Islamic Courts"  (i.e. the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan#Shariat Appellate Bench|Shariah Appellate Bench]] and [[Federal Shariat Court]]), established by Bhutto's successor General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], and these, rather than the executive or legislature of Pakistan, undid much of Ali Bhutto's reform program. According to scholar Charles H. Kennedy, the courts effectively "suspended implementation" of the land reforms, "repealed the reforms, drafted new legislation, and then interpreted the new laws' meanings".&lt;ref name=kennedy-121&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Charles|title=Islamization of Laws and Economy, Case Studies on Pakistan|date=1996|publisher=Institute of Policy Studies, The Islamic Foundation|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In early 1979, the "Shariat Bench" of the [[Peshawar High Court]]" found the section of the 1972 law granting tenants the right to buy land they worked before other offers ("right to preemption") was "repugnant to Islam" and thus void. The petitioners against the law had successfully argued that "nowhere in the Holy Quran or [[Sunnah]]" was there mention of a tenant's right to preemption.&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 111"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.111&lt;/ref&gt; The right to preemption according to the  ''a [[hadith]]'' (the recorded reports of the teachings, deeds and sayings of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] that make up much of the ''Sunnah'') according to the petitioners and judges of the Shariat Bench went instead to the&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 111"/&gt;
#''shafi sharik'' (in ''Shariat'' law, "cosharers" or co-owners of the land)&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 114"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.114&lt;/ref&gt;
#''shafi khalit'', ("participants in immunities and appendages", i.e. those sharing special right on the property such as right of passage, right of irrigation, etc.,);&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 114"/&gt;
# ''shafi jar'', (contiguous owners, those "owning an immovable property adjacent to the immovable property sold").&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 111"/&gt;

This decision was reaffirmed by the [[Federal Shariat Court]] in 1981&lt;ref&gt;in Hafiz Muhammad Ameen vs Islamic Republic of Pakistan PLD 1981, FSC 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 112"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.112&lt;/ref&gt; (although the court acknowledged that "Islam recognized the validity of state imposed limits on wealth for the purpose of alleviating poverty or providing for the public good", which was a goal of the land reform laws&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 114"/&gt;), and upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan#Shariat Appellate Bench|Shariah Appellate Bench]] of the Supreme Court in 1986 in a 3 to 2 decision. This decision was "clarified and reclarified" in subsequent decisions,&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 117"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.117&lt;/ref&gt; (but confusion over what land transfers were valid or not under the "old law" remained since legal proceedings with "final decree"  prior to the August 1986 ruling remained valid&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 117"/&gt;{{#tag:ref| for example, over 5000 cases on pre-emption were pending before provincial courts in Punjab.|group=Note}}).

In August 1989 the Shariat Appellate Bench struck down several more measures of the 1972 land reform law.&lt;ref&gt;Case: Qazalbash Waqf and Others vs. Chief Land Commissioner&lt;/ref&gt; It ruled unanimously that provisions that allowed the confiscation of land without compensation were un-Islamic. On other measures it divided 3 to 2. It ruled that [[Waqf]] (an Islamic religious endowment, typically a donated plot of land or building) land was exempt from any provision of land reform laws; that the ceilings on amount of land owned were an undue restriction on property rights,&lt;ref name="CKILE1996: 119"&gt;[[#CKILE1996|Kennedy, ''Islamization of Laws and Economy'', 1996]]: p.119&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that "Islam does not countenance compulsory redistribution of wealth or land for the purpose of alleviating poverty, however laudable the goal of poverty relief may be."&lt;ref name=kennedy-120&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Charles|title=Islamization of Laws and Economy, Case Studies on Pakistan|date=1996|publisher=Institute of Policy Studies, The Islamic Foundation|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|As of 2014, this ruling appears to have remained in effect according to:  {{cite web|last1=Butt|first1=Aamir|title=Ibtidah Current Affairs Social Development Creative Writing Photo Journalism Inspiration Philosophy and Natural Sciences LAND REFORMS IN PAKISTAN-A REVIEW|url=http://laaltain.com/ibtidah/2014/05/03/land-reforms-in-pakistan-a-review/|website=laaltain.com|accessdate=1 January 2015}}|group=Note}}&lt;ref name=khanSS-SP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Shahid Saeed|title=Land Reforms – History, Legal challenges and how Shariat Courts abolished them|url=http://secularpakistan.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/land-reforms-history-legal-challenges-and-how-shariat-courts-abolished-them/|website=secularpakistan|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ordinances dealing with Islamic finance included the ''[[Zakāt]]'' and ''[[Islamic taxes#Ushr|Ushr]]'' Ordinances issued on 20 June 1980, to Islamize taxation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Since it was introduced through the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance No. 17 of 1980 ... the real lives and economic conditions of millions of Pakistani citizens have been completely unchanged, but a great number of socioreligious and political problems have arisen from state involvement in zakat administration."&lt;ref name=Salim-117&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salim|first1=Arskal|title=Challenging the Secular State: The Islamization of Law in Modern Indonesia|date=2008|publisher=University of Hawaii Press.|pages=117–119|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pnUI036m3tUC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=zakat+pakistan#v=onepage&amp;q=zakat%20pakistan&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 December 2014|isbn=9780824832377}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Holsinger served as [[chair (official)|chair]] of the board of the Good Samaritan Foundation, a [[philanthropic]] [[health care]] organization, the [[United Methodist Church]] of Kentucky sued the foundation over control of $20 million in assets. Holsinger said the church was "only interested in the foundation's money, not its cause." In October, 2007, the case was decided in the church's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Asbury Theological Seminary===
In November, 2007, the [[Asbury Theological Seminary]] [[board of trustees]] attempted to remove Holsinger from its board for a possible [[conflict of interest]] because he was also a board member of the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]], a division of which was investigating the [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] status of the [[seminary]]. According to Holsinger, he subsequently resigned because he believed the board was asking him to be less than truthful with regulatory agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Nomination for Surgeon General==

===Confirmation process===
[[File:Holsinger and Koop.jpg|thumb|right|Holsinger with Surgeon General Koop 2007]]
On May 24, 2007, Holsinger was nominated by George W. Bush to become the 18th Surgeon General of the United States. The [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] (HELP) held the confirmation hearing on July 12, 2007.&lt;ref name ="NYT071307"&gt;{{cite web

Holsinger was supported by the [[American College of Physicians]] and former Surgeons General [[C. Everett Koop]] and [[Joycelyn Elders]]. He was opposed by several gay and lesbian organizations and the [[American Public Health Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Given the Democratic resistance coupled with Holsinger's lack of response to the committee's questions after more than ten months, in June 2008, thirteen months after his nomination, Kentucky Senator [[Jim Bunning]], a Holsinger supporter, suggested the nomination was dead which the White House and fellow Kentucky Senator and [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]] denied. The political scientist [[Norman Ornstein]] said, "It's extremely unusual for somebody not to answer questions. It's a big fat 'dis' of the committee and of the Senate. Even if you know or believe you are not likely to be confirmed, the idea that you wouldn't sort of do what the committee has asked is still kind of mind-boggling." The committee's Republican [[ranking member]] said Holsinger's lack of response was "not helpful" while the [[editorial board]] of Kentucky's [[Courier-Journal]] characterized it as "disrespectful" and "baffling".&lt;ref name="HL061808"&gt;{{cite web

The nomination was never voted on by the Senate and afterwards, in January 2009, Bush appointed him to fill a vacant unpaid position on the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]] to expire May 2010.&lt;ref name="010709AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LH010709"/&gt;

===Nomination controversy===
Following the nomination, Holsinger's views on homosexuality came under scrutiny, and several Democratic senators expressed concern or opposition to the nomination. In addition, individuals released statements supporting or opposing the nomination. Kevin Naff, editor of the [[LGBT]] newspaper, the ''[[Washington Blade]]'', charged that Holsinger has a "long record of anti-gay bias."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The critics were largely concerned with a 1991 [[white paper]]  he wrote titled ''[http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/Holsinger_on_Homosexuality.pdf Pathophysiology of Male Homosexuality]'' for a committee in the United Methodist Church reviewing its position that homosexuality violates Christian teaching.&lt;ref name="Banerjee June9"/&gt; According to [[Jake Tapper]] of [[ABC News]], the paper "purported" to discuss homosexuality from a medical standpoint.&lt;ref name="Banerjee June9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCNEWS"&gt;{{cite web

Supporters of Holsinger's nomination defended the paper as a review of the relevant medical literature at that time.&lt;ref name="Banerjee June9"/&gt; Critics said the paper reflected a pre-1970s view of human sexuality, and that it had a political agenda and was not a scientific paper.&lt;ref name="ABCNEWS"/&gt; At his confirmation hearing, Holsinger said the paper did not represent his current views and was not "an example of my scientific work."&lt;ref name="NYT071307"/&gt;

Critics have also expressed concerns about Holsinger's leadership of The United Methodist Church's Judicial Council, the highest court of the Church. In 2005, the court defrocked [[Irene Elizabeth Stroud]], an openly lesbian minister, and in a separate case reinstated a pastor who had been suspended for refusing to allow a gay man to join his congregation.&lt;ref name = "Banerjee June9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="criticism surprises"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT110105"&gt;{{cite web

'''Kansakār''' ([[Devanagari]]: कंसकार) or '''Kasāh''' (कसाः) is a Nepalese caste group belonging to the [[Newar]] community of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] in [[Nepal]]. In [[Sanskrit]], Kansakar means bronze worker, and their traditional occupation has been metal working and trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Lewis| first =Todd T.| url = http://college.holycross.edu/faculty/tlewis/PDFs/Buddhist_Merchants_in_Kathmandu.pdf| title =Buddhist Merchants in Kathmandu: The Asan Twah Market and Uray Social Organization| work = Contested Hierarchies| publisher = Oxford: Clarendon Press| date=1995| accessdate = 26 March 2012}} Page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Wright| first =Daniel| url = https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfNepal/HistoryOfNepaldanielWright_djvu.txt| title =History of Nepal with an Introductory Sketch of the Country and People of Nepal| work = | publisher =Cambridge| date=1877| accessdate = 23 September 2012}} Page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, they are merchants, industrialists and professionals.

Kansakars have been traditionally based in Kel Tol in the historical section of [[Kathmandu]] where they play a major cultural role. The neighborhood is famed for the sacred courtyard of Jana Baha (Machhendra Bahal) where the central temple houses an image of Aryavalokitesvara (Sacred [[Avalokiteśvara]]), a [[Buddhist]] deity popularly known as Jana Baha Dyah or White Machhendranath&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Locke, S.J.| first =John K.| url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/54318635/1John-Locke-Newar-Buddhist-Initiation-Rites| title =Newar Buddhist Initiation Rites| work = INAS Journal| publisher = | date=| accessdate = 26 March 2012}} Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; (alternative name: White Karunamaya).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Yoshizaki| first =Kazumi| url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/30857088/Yoshizaki-Kazumi-NewarBuddhism| title =The Kathmandu Valley as a Water Pot: Abstracts of research papers on Newar Buddhism in Nepal| work = | publisher = | date=2006| accessdate = 29 March 2012}} Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional occupation==

According to the division of labour laid down from ancient times, Kansakars practiced the hereditary occupation of making utensils of bronze. Kitchen and ritual vessels, various types of dinner plates and cymbals are their main products. A dinner plate with a grooved border known as ''siphala dema'' (सिफाला देमा) is their specialty. Bronze is made in their workshops by melting copper and tin and mixing them in a charcoal-fired furnace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasāh|first=Dev Ratna|title=Kasāhtaygu Jya |url= |accessdate=|newspaper= Udāy Samā|date=26 July 2003}} Page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were also major players in the traditional [[Tibet]] trade, and maintained business houses in [[Lhasa]] in Tibet and in [[Kalimpong]] and [[Kolkata]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;Hilker, DS Kansakar (2005), ''Syamukapu: The Lhasa Newars of Kalimpong and Kathmandu'', Kathmandu: Vajra Publications. {{ISBN|99946-644-6-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural life==

Kansakars participate in the annual chariot procession of Aryavalokitesvara which is known as [[Jana Baha Dyah Jatra]] by playing long horns. The Kansakar [[Gunla Bajan]] musical band organizes performances of religious music during the hold month of Gunla and other festivals.

The 12-yearly [[Samyak]] is the most spectacular Newar Buddhist festival held in Kathmandu where statues of [[Dipankara Buddha]] are displayed. Each Urāy caste has been assigned a duty in the festival from ancient times, and Kansakars have the task of preparing and serving five types of foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Lewis| first =Todd T.| url = http://college.holycross.edu/faculty/tlewis/PDFs/Buddhist_Merchants_in_Kathmandu.pdf| title =Buddhist Merchants in Kathmandu: The Asan Twah Market and Uray Social Organization| work = Contested Hierarchies| publisher = Oxford: Clarendon Press| date=1995| accessdate = 26 March 2012}} Pages 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kansakars participate in the [[Kumha Pyakhan dance]] (also known as Kumar Pyakhan) which is held annually during the [[Mohani]] festival in October on the open-air dance platform at Asan and at Kathmandu [[Durbar Square]]. A young Tuladhar or Kansakar boy is chosen to be the dancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hoek, Bert van den  |author2=Shrestha, Balgopal|title=Guardians of the Royal Goddess: Daitya and Kumar as the Protectors of Taleju Bhavani of Kathmandu|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_19_02_03.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=July 1992}} Page 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Todd T.|title=Notes on the Uray and the Modernization of Newar Buddhism|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_23_01_08.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=Contributions to Nepalese Studies|date=January 1996}} Page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21551">'''Khazen''' (also "El-Khazen", and in some cases Al Khazen or De Khazen, [[Arabic]]: الخازن) is the name of a prominent noble [[Levant]]ine family and clan based in [[Keserwan District]], [[Lebanon]], [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], [[Nablus]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], as well as other districts around the [[Levant]], predominantly in the [[Galilee]]. The Khazen family originally [[Druze]] Arabs later converted to [[Maronite]] [[Christians]], have traced their lineage through DNA testing to [[Jericho]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (also known as Tell el-Sultan) 8500 B.C.{{sfn|National Geographic DNA Project}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2018|reason=Reference given leads nowhere. The ancestry claimed may also be less unusual than it might appear at first sight.}} Several members have played leading roles in [[politics of Lebanon|politics]] for many generations. [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] elevated the family to the [[French nobility]] and referred to them as "princes of the [[Maronites]]" in many letters. [[Pope Clement X]] made them [[Count palatine|Counts Palatine]]. Most of the Lebanese Khazen branch is Maronite, while other branches are Greek Orthodox and Muslim but are not related to the Mount-Lebanese, which were endowed with these honors.

==History==
The Khazen [[Cheikhs]] can trace back their lineage to the 9th century, when they were mainly located between [[Houran]], [[Damascus]], [[Baalbeck]], and [[Nablus]]. They started buying and acquiring lands in [[Mount Lebanon]] during the 15th century and, more specifically, first in [[Jaj]] (currently in [[Jbeil District]]). They continued their exodus to the Keserwan district, where they bought lands from the [[Shi'a]] tribes. This caused the Shi'a to move towards what is known today as the South of Lebanon and the Maronites to the Keserwan district.

In 1584, the Khazen were able to hide the princes [[Fakhr-al-Din II|Fakhreddine]] and Younès in Ballouneh. At that time, their father, cornered by the Ottoman's army and losing the fight against them, informed his wife Sitt Nossab to send his sons to the Khazen, a powerful and influential family at that time. The great Fakhreddine, when he took power, was greatly influenced by the Khazen family politically and religiously. In return, he granted them the title of ''[[Cheikh]]'' and complete political influence and control of [[Mount Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;2004 Maronite Synod, ''[http://www.maronite-heritage.com/LNE.php?page=File3text19 The Maronite Church and Politics]'', § 10 &amp; 11. Quote: "When the Ottoman state became displeased with the emirs of the ‘Assaf family and with their aides from the Hobeish family, they endeavored to gradually eliminate them, replacing them with the princes of the Bani Sayfa family.  The latter, too, were from the Turkmen tribes, brought in by the Ottoman state to protect the shores.  However, they used to rule according to the Shari’a, and not according to civil convention.  During that period, the Maronite migration toward the southern regions of Mount Lebanon coincided with their contact with Rome and the West through the Franciscan missionaries and other Christian organizations working in the Holy Land.  They soon started a new partnership, first with the Ma’an family and prince Fakhreddin, through the Khazen family and, in a second stage, with the Abi-l-Lama’ family.  Fakhreddin aspired to gain independence from the Ottoman Empire and wished to be open to the West. ... During that period, harmony was complete, not just between the Maronite Church and the Lebanese Emirate with the different confessions and beliefs of the princes, but also between the Church and the new Maronite leadership, such as the Hobeish and Khazen families, among others.  These were, unlike the Mouqaddams, very zealous for the interests of the Church."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Khazen also gave shelter to Prince Haidar [[Chehab family|Shehab]]'s sons, in Keserwan in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Khoury Harb, ''The Maronites: History and Constants'', p. 116. Quote: "When Prince Ahmad Maan died, the Shehabs, relatives of the Maan, took over. When the regent Prince Bashir I passed away in 1706, Prince Haidar reigned, and moved the seat of the emirate from Hasbaya to Deir el-Qamar. The Ottoman Wali of Sidon deposed the Shehabi Prince and replaced him by the leader of the Yamani party, Prince Yussef Alam - Eddin. Haidar fled with his two sons and some of his followers to Ghazir in Kisrawan where his allies, the Khazen and Hobeish families from the Qaysi party, were in control. When the army of Prince Yussef Alam-Eddin conquered and burnt Ghazir, Haidar left his sons in Kisrawan and took refuge in Hermel. The sheikhs of the Khazen family offered hiding-places to the prince's family."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khazen families, who were now controlling the Kerserwan district, were very influential within the [[Maronite Church]]. This is due to their financial support of the Church and their assistance in its expansion by the construction of many monasteries, several of which they still own today, as well as their connections to the French.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Moosa, ''The Maronites in History'', p. 283. Quote: "We have also seen earlier that the Maronite community had been placed under the protection of France and that the French kings began to choose their consuls from among the Maronite dignitaries. Through the power and prestige of France the consuls then exercised authority over the Maronite Church and its clergy. The Maronites were so proud to be under the protection of France that some Maronites called themselves, 'the French of the East.' Thus, through France, the Shihabi amirs, who will be discussed shortly, realized the importance of Maronite rule and power, and they and the Maronites became united in a common interest. In 1697, Amir Ahmad died without an heir, and the Druze notables chose his nephew Bashir al-Shihabi as their new ruler. He was succeeded in 1707 by the young Amir Haydar al-Shihabi, grandson of Amir Ahmad al-Ma'ni. Haydar recognized the authority of the Maronite al-Khazins and the Hubayshis of Kisrawan and Ghazir and treated these two families as equal to the feudalistic Druze families." [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ogp94y8CJgC&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; They also offered lands and, most importantly, supplied security to the Church and the Maronite community overall. In 1656, Cheikh Abou Nawfal received a [[Papal Orders of Chivalry|Papal decoration]] for his help in the expansion of the Maronite faith in Mount Lebanon. The family was consulted on each patriarchal election and controlled episcopal nominations for three Maronite [[archbishop]]rics—representing the districts of [[Aleppo]], [[Baalbeck]], and [[Damascus]]—until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Van Leeuwen, ''Notables and Clergy in Mount Lebanon: The Khāzin Sheikhs and the Maronite Church (1736-1840)'', p. 103-104. Quote: "The influence of the Khāzin sheiks in clerical matters concentrated on two aspects, which were, as far as the clergy were concerned, closely interrelated: the nomination of prelates and the founding and administration of clerical and monastic possessions. Traditionally, the main Maronite nobles were consulted on the occasion of the election of the patriarch. ... Eventually, the three main branches of the Khāzin family acquired the privilege of selecting the ''mutrāns'' of the dioceses of Aleppo (''awlād'' Abī Nasīf), Baalbek (''awlād'' Abī Qānsawh), and Damascus (''awlād'' Abī Nawfal). This privilege was acknowledged by Patriarch Ya'qūb 'Awwād. It is, therefore, evident that the Khāzin sheiks also interfered in dioceses which officially had no connection with their administrative territory, an indication that they saw their role in church matters as an extension of their political power within the community as a whole." (''[http://khazen.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2094:election-of-the-maronite-patriarch-history&amp;catid=141:khazen-blog&amp;Itemid=213 Text also available here]''.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farid el-Khazen, ''The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon, 1967-1976'', p. 35. Quote: "By the mid-19th century, the church and its monastic orders were present in various areas of the Mountain. Its power had surpassed that of the lordly Maronite families, notably the Khazen family, on which it had previously depended for protection and support. 'By the end of the 18th century,' writes Iliya Harik, the 'church had become the largest, the most organized, and the wealthiest organization in the whole of Mount Lebanon.' It established educational institutions in various parts of the Mountain and had an educated and active clergy. By the time the ''Mutasarrifiyya'' was established, the Maronite Patriarch emerged as the de facto central political figure in Mount Lebanon." [https://books.google.com/books?id=TQdheeeXQCgC&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; There were three important and influential patriarchs from the Khazen family: [[Joseph Dergham El Khazen|Youssef Dargham]] (1733–1742), [[Tobias El Khazen|Toubia]] (1756–1766) and [[Joseph Ragi El Khazen|Youssef Ragi]] (1845–1854). Several bishops have also shared the name, including [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/belkhm.html Michel] (Caesarea, 1767-1786), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/belkhi.html Ignace] (Nablus, 1787-1819), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/belkhg.html Germanos] (Damascus, 1794-1806), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/belkhe.html Estefan] (Damascus, 1806-1830), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bgazen.html Anton] (Baalbeck, 1807-1858), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bgazeno.html Estefan] (Damascus, 1848-1868), [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/belkh.html Louis Joseph] (Ptolemais, 1919-1933), and [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/baboukh.html Georges Abou] (Rusadus, 2014-current).

In 1858, [[Tanius Shahin|Tanios Chahine]] started a [[Tanyus Shahin#Leadership of peasants' revolt|rebellion]] against the Khazen family, which caused a great loss to their dominance over Kerserwan. The rebellion was a result of a power struggle between the Abi Lamaa family, the [[England|English]], the [[France|French]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], and particular Khazen who wanted to increase their influence.&lt;ref&gt;William Harris, ''Lebanon: A History, 600-2011'', p. 162. Quote: "After 1860, France and Britain converged in protecting their stakes in the empire against Russian encroachment. French defeat by Prussia in 1870 made France more risk averse. French interest in Maronite clerical turf struggles with governors waned; indeed, France was the chief architect of the eventual competitor of the church -- the elected administrative council. France was schizophrenic in upholding both the Ottomans and its own influence in Mount Lebanon and Syria. Davud Pasha, an Armenian Catholic, developed fruitful relations with foreign consuls and strong local commitment. These were assets in resuscitating the local secular elite. In the Kisrawan, Davud reconciled the Khazen sheikhs and the peasants, the former retrieving much of their property and the latter mollified with tax and land concessions." [https://books.google.com/books?id=J-EvNaeh6gsC&amp;pg=PA162]&lt;/ref&gt; After these events, the Khazen stayed involved in politics, yet their work as one family holding ultimate Maronite power has diminished greatly.

The Khazen crest, which includes snowy mountains and a cedar tree, reflects the family's special closeness to the country, and especially to Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/khazen.png The Khazen Crest] (image).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple branches of the family. The 2 main branches are based in [[Ajaltoun]], which mainly traces its origins from Nawfal Abou Nassif el-Khazen (son of Nader Abou Nawfal el-Khazen), and [[Ghosta, Mount Lebanon|Ghosta]], which mainly traces its origins from Fayad Abou Kanso el-Khazen (son of Nader Abou Nawfal; also, consul of France).&lt;ref&gt;[http://khazen.org/genealogical_tree Khazen Genealogical Tree]. See ''Nader Abou Nawfal'' and his list of children.&lt;/ref&gt; Kfardebian, which is nearby, also has a sizable branch.

==Today==

In modern times, Khazen have always represented [[Keserwan]] with at least one [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in the [[Parliament of Lebanon|Lebanese Parliament]]. They have also been represented in many recent governments. Prominent politicians include Cheikh Philippe El Khazen, a prominent doctor and medical professor born in 1921 in Ghosta. Cheikh Philippe El Khazen was a member of the Parliament in 1968-1972 and a Co-Founder and Vice President of the Maronite League. He was also a member of the European Christian Democratic Party.
Cheikh Elias Choukrallah El Khazen, minister and deputy born in 1927 from Ajaltoun, was a member of Parliament in 1964, 1972, 1992, 1996 and Minister of Interior from 1989 - 1990. Cheikh Elias Choukrallah El Khazen as a deputy signed the Taef agreement to end the Lebanese civil war and to return to political normalcy in Lebanon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6454">'''Lukomorye''', '''Lukomorie''' or '''Lukomorje''' ({{lang-ru|Лукомо́рье}}) is a fictional land in [[Russia]]n [[folklore]] and [[history]]. The Russian word itself is an obsolete term for "[[bight (geography)|bight]]" or "[[bay]]". In the word  "luk-o-mor-ye", "-o-" is an [[infix]] to connect two roots, "-ye" is an [[affix]] (in this case, of relative location), "luk-" is the root for "bend", "mor-" is the root for "sea". It can also be translated as "curved sea-shore" or  "inlet of the sea".

The toponym "Sea Bend" (лука моря, ''luka morya'') and the derivations: ''lukomorye'', ''lukomorians'', etc., has been applied to various geographical locations.&lt;ref&gt;Энциклопедия [http://feb-web.ru/feb/slovenc/es/es3/es3-1832.htm "Слова о полку Игореве"]: В 5 томах / Рос. акад. наук.

It is said that a certain marvellous and incredible occurrence, and very like a fable, happens every year to the people of Lucomoryae, namely, that they die on the 27th of November, which among the Russians is dedicated to [[St. George]], and come to life again like the frosts in the following spring, generally on the 24th of April.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
The Cossin is a river which flows down from the mountains of Lucomorya ; at its mouth is the fortress of Cossin, which was formerly possessed by the Knes Ventza, but now by his sons. &lt;br&gt;
From the sources of the great river Cossin to this point is a journey of two months. Moreover, from the sources of the same river, rises another river Cassima, which, after passing through the district of Lucomorya, flows into the great river Tachnin ; beyond which are said to dwell men of prodigious stature, some of whom are covered all over with hair, like wild beasts, while others have heads like dogs, and others have no necks, their breast occupying the place of a head, while they have long hands, but no feet.

'''Mikveh Israel''' ({{lang-he-n|מִקְוֵה יִשְׂרָאֵל}}; "Hope of Israel") is a [[youth village]] and [[boarding school]] in central Israel. Located in [[Tel Aviv District]], it had a population of {{Israel populations|Miqwe Yisra'el}} in {{Israel populations|Year}}.

Established in 1870, it was the first [[Jews|Jewish]] [[agricultural]] school in what is now [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai (1971) ''Mikve Israel'' Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel'', 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mikveh Israel was founded in April 1870 by [[Charles Netter]], an emissary of the French organization [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]], aiming to be an educational institution where young Jews could learn agriculture and leave to establish villages and settlements all over the country and to make the desert blossom. It was established on a tract of land southeast of [[Jaffa]] leased from the Ottoman Sultan, who allocated {{convert|750|acre|km2}} to the project.&lt;ref name="goisrael.com"&gt;[http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Articles/Sites/Mikve+Israel+Agricultural+School.htm Mikve Israel Agricultural School] Go Israel&lt;/ref&gt; The name is taken from two passages in the [[Book of Jeremiah]], Jeremiah 14:8 and 17:13, and was proposed by Wolf Grinstein, one of the school's first students, who later taught there. 

Netter, the first headmaster, introduced new methods of agricultural training, with Baron [[Edmond James de Rothschild]] contributing to the upkeep of the school. Netter pioneered progressive educational methods and a new way of life and agricultural training to the future farmers of this land. There were only about 20,000{{cn|date=October 2017}} [[Old Yishuv|Jews in the country]] at that time, mostly established in the [[Four Holy Cities|traditional cities of Judaism]]: Jerusalem, Tiberias, Safed and Hebron. 

In 1898, [[Theodor Herzl]] met the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] at the main entrance of Mikveh Israel during Herzl's only visit to [[Eretz Yisrael]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120212143554/http://www.shimur.org/english/article.php?id=13 First Agricultural School - Mikveh Yisrael (1870)] Shimur&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting, a PR event engineered by Herzl to publicly meet the Kaiser, was misinterpreted by the world media as a legitimization of Herzl and [[Zionism]] by [[Germany]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/145mag/herzl_hechler/herzl_hechler.htm heodore Herzl and Rev. William Hechler and the Zionist Beginnings] The Jewish Magazine, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Today, entrance to the school grounds is via the city of [[Holon]].&lt;ref name="goisrael.com"/&gt;

For many decades (until the establishment of the [[Agricultural Research Organization, Volcani Center|Volcani Center]] and the Faculty of Agriculture in Rechovot) the school served as the research center for the country. Their teachers wrote the first study books about agriculture and served as field advisors. Most of the agricultural know-how of the first 50 years was collected and published by Mikve Israel. After finishing their studies, the thousands of graduates left Mikve Israel to start agricultural settlements of all kinds, villages and kibbutzim, moshavim, farms and agricultural schools; or serving in management positions; or continued their agricultural studies in institutions of higher learning and filling positions in research and development, the export branches, marketing and agricultural management.

In 1938–1939, at the request of the [[Youth Aliyah]], a section for religious youth was built to house the religious and traditional youngsters who fled western Europe just before the start of [[the Holocaust]].

==Geography==
Mikve Israel is located on a strategic crosspoint on the road connecting [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Jerusalem]]. Part of the only green space in Tel Aviv District, it has been used as an organizing point for the convoys and up to the [[Gulf War]].

==Education==
The village has about 1,800 pupils from the age of 12 to the age of 18; 800 in the General section, 320 in the religious school, 380 in the French-Israeli college and high school. Around 280 students are boarders and the site also hosts four Montessori and holistic pedagogy kindergartens, and a Montessori elementary school.

In 2007 Mikve Israel and the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] inaugurated an experimental bilateral Israel-France high school, with half of its pupils studying for the French Baccalauréat and half for Israeli [[Bagrut]].

==Agriculture==
The agricultural grounds of Mikve Israel cover over 2,200 dunams (out of a general area of 3,300 dunams). Most of the fields are irrigated using wells and include field crops, industrial crops, vegetables, fruit trees, orange groves and greenhouses. The school also raises animals including milk cows, chickens and honey bees, as well as having auxiliary branches including computerized agriculture.

One dunam (0.1 hectares) is covered by greenhouses. The aim of the greenhouse production branch is to teach students and allow them to research greenhouse issues and technologies. A [[rainwater harvesting]] system allows efficient re-use of water collected from the roof for growing of vegetables in greenhouses.

Gardening and landscaping activity over 100 dunams (10 hectares) includes woods, lawns and beauty &amp; leisure gardens and spots throughout the village. The gardening and landscaping is maintained by the students supervised and coached by the manager of this production branch.

The botanical garden was established in 1930 in order to adapt and acclimate trees and species to the Israeli climate. Plants were imported from all over the world. It now covers now 70 dunams (7 hectares).

The dairy farm covers as genetics, computers, milking parlor and cooling, product quality control, feeding, herd health, udder health, artificial insemination and embryo transfer and implants.

The stable has the following breeds of riding horses: Hanoverian, Holland and quarter-horse breeds suited to all types of horseback riding: western, sports, and therapeutic riding.

A '''milkmaid''' (or '''milk maid''') was a girl or woman who milked cows.{{Fact|reason=seems obvious but is not, in the Netherlands women (also) delivered the milk|date=August 2016}} She also used the [[milk]] to prepare [[dairy products]] such as [[cream]], [[butter]], and [[cheese]]. Many large houses employed milkmaids instead of having other staff do the work. The term ''milkmaid'' is not the female equivalent of ''[[milkman]]'' in the sense of one who delivers milk to the consumer;  it is the female equivalent of ''milkman'' in the sense of ''[[Cowman (profession)|cowman]]''.{{Fact|reason=in the Netherlands women (also) delivered the milk, so a source for this distinction is needed|date=August 2016}}

The expression "as smooth as a milk maid's skin" means exceptionally smooth. This phrase came about as a result of exposure to [[cowpox]], which causes no serious symptoms, but does convey a partial [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the disfiguring (and often fatal) disease [[smallpox]].  Thus, milkmaids lacked the scarred, pockmarked complexion common to smallpox survivors.  This observation led to the development of the first [[vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stern|first=Alexandra Minna|author2=[[Howard Markel]] |title=The History Of Vaccines And Immunization: Familiar Patterns, New Challenges |journal=Health Affairs|year=2005|volume=24|issue=3|pages=611–621|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/3/611.full.pdf|accessdate=25 December 2010|pmid=15886151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Munya''' or '''Muya''' (also ''Manyak'' 曼牙科,&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/M/Manyak.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ''Menia'' 么呢阿&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/M/Menia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) is one of the [[Qiangic languages]] spoken in China. There are two dialects, Northern and Southern, which are not [[mutually intelligible]]. Most research on Munya has been conducted by Ikeda Takumi.

==Names==
The language has been spelled various ways, including ''Manyak, Menya, Minyag, Minyak''. Other names are ''Boba'' and ''Miyao''.

==Dialects==
''Ethnologue'' (21st edition) lists two Muya dialects, namely Eastern (Nyagrong) and Western (Darmdo). Muya is spoken in:
*[[Shimian County]], [[Ya'an]]
*[[Jiulong County]]
*[[Kangding]]

Sun (1991) documents Muya 木雅 of Liuba Township 六坝乡, Shade District 沙德区, [[Kangding County]] 康定县, Sichuan (Sun 1991:219).

==Popular culture==
In 2008, Bamu, a singer with the Jiuzhaigou Art Troupe in the Aba Tibetan and Qiang autonomous prefecture in Sichuan, recorded an album of Muya songs (木雅七韵).&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2014-05/27/content_17544535.htm Chasing the fading music] 2014-05-27 07:13 By Huang Zhiling (China Daily USA)] "One woman's passion for the songs of a remote ethnic people may save not only the Muya's music, but the language itself. Huang Zhiling reports from Chengdu. Muya music might already be lost if Yang Hua had not given up her job as a mathematics teacher." ..."After the recording was over, Bamu told Yang it was a folk song of the Muya people. The song told how a girl working outside her hometown misses her mom, who says jewelry does not mean anything if one is not educated, and the singer wishes her mom good health. "It was the first time I heard the word 'Muya'," Yang says."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nazism sidebar |expanded=Race}}

'''Nazism and race''' concerns the [[Nazi Party]]'s adoption and further development of several hypotheses concerning their concept of [[Race (human categorization)|race]]. Classifications of human races were made and various measurements of population samples were carried out during the 1930s.

==Racial hierarchy==
The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] claimed to observe scientifically a strict hierarchy of the human race. Hitler's view towards race and people can be found throughout ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' but more specifically in chapter 11 "Nation and Race". The standard-issue propaganda text issued to members of the Hitler Youth contained a chapter on "the race of the German people" that heavily cited the works of Hans F. K. Günther. The text seems to address the European races in descending orders on the Nazi hierarchy, with the Nordic race (plus the subrace of Phalic) first, the Western (Mediterranean) race second, Dinarics third, Eastern (Alpine) people fourth, and finally East Baltics last.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Harwood L. Childs (translator). "The Nazi Primer." New York: Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, 1938. Page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aryan: Nordic and Germanic ===
Hitler made references to an "[[Aryan race|Aryan Race]]" founding a superior type of humanity. The purest stock of Aryans according to Nazi ideology was the [[Nordic race|Nordic people]] of Germany, England, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden and Norway. The Nazis defined Nordics as being identified by tall stature (average 175&amp;nbsp;cm), long faces, prominent chins, narrow and straight noses with a low bridge, lean builds, [[Dolichocephaly|doliocephalic skulls]], straight light hair, light eyes, and fair skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/catech.htm|title=Nazi anti-Semitic Catechism|first=Randall|last=Bytwerk|date=|website=research.calvin.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis claimed that Germanic people specifically represented a southern branch of the Aryan-Nordic population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mein Kampf|last=Hitler|first=Adolf|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=240|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis did not consider all Germans to be of the Nordic type (which predominated the north), and stated that Germany also had a large "Alpine" population (identified by, among other features, lower stature, stocky builds, flatter noses, and higher incidences of darker hair and eyes). Hitler and Nazi racial theorist [[Hans F. K. Günther]] framed this as an issue to be corrected through selective breeding for "Nordic" traits.&lt;ref&gt;Günther (1927), p.97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mein Kampf|last=Hitler|first=Adolf|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=247|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler Youth propaganda emphasized the "Nordic" nature of Germans, with the text issued to all Hitler Youth members stating: "the principal ingredient of our people is the Nordic race (55%). That is not to say that half our people are pure Nordics. All of the aforementioned races appear in mixtures in all parts of our fatherland. The circumstance, however, that the great part of our people is of Nordic descent justifies us taking a Nordic standpoint when evaluating our character and spirit, bodily structure, and physical beauty."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Aryan: Finns===

As Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941]], Finland participated in the invasion primarily to recover the territories it was forced to cede to the USSR after the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] which ended the [[Winter War]] between the Finns and the Soviets.&lt;ref name="rich"&gt;Rich, Norman (1974). ''Hitler's War Aims: the Establishment of the New Order'', pp. 400-401. W. W. Norton &amp; Company Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finnish conquest of East Karelia (1941)|Military success]] quickly resulted in the [[Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia|Finnish occupation of Eastern Karelia]]. Because of their [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] heritage, the [[Finns]] were initially classified by Nazi racial experts as a people unrelated to the other [[Nordic countries]], in spite of a long history of political unity with [[Sweden]]. As a result, the [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking minority of Finland]] was favoured at first over Finnish speakers for recruitment into the [[Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS|Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the]] [[Waffen-SS]] because they were categorically considered part of the "[[Nordic race]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nieme, Jarto; Pipes, Jason. [http://www.feldgrau.com/articles.php?ID=19 "Finnish Volunteers in the Wehrmacht in WWII"]. ''Feldgrau''. Retrieved 27 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to Finland's substantial military contribution on the northern flank of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front of World War II]], Hitler decreed in November 1942 that "from now on Finland and the Finnish people be treated and designated as a Nordic state and a Nordic people", which he considered one of the highest compliments that the Nazi government could bestow upon another country.&lt;ref name="rich"/&gt;

=== Lower classes ===

==== Britain ====
According to Gunther, the purest Nordic regions were Scandinavia and [[northern Germany]], particularly Norway and Sweden, specifying: "We may, perhaps, take the Swedish blood to be over 80 per cent Nordic, the Norwegian blood about 80 per cent." Britain and southern Germany by contrast were not considered entirely Nordic. Germany was said to be 55% Nordic, and the rest Alpine (particularly [[southern Germany]]), Dinaric, or East Baltic (particularly [[eastern Germany]]). On the British Isles, Gunther stated: "we may adopt the following racial proportions for these islands: Nordic blood, 60 percent; Mediterranean, 30 percent; Alpine, 10 percent." He added that "The Nordic strain in Germany seems to be rather more distributed over the whole people than in England, where it seems to belong far more to the upper classes."&lt;ref&gt;Gunther 1927, Chapter: Distribution of European Races in Europe: Britain, France, Germany, and Belgium. Pages 62 to 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler echoed this sentiment, referring to the English lower classes as "racially inferior."&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler: table talk November 5th, 1941 (in: Hitler's Table Talk, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
Hitler viewed the French as close to the Germans racially, but not quite their peers. He said of their racial character: "France remains hostile to us. She contains, in addition to her Nordic blood, a blood that will always be foreign to us."&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler: table talk January 31st, 1942 (in: Hitler's Table Talk, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; Gunther echoed this sentiment, saying that the French were predominantly Alpine and Mediterranean rather than Nordic, but that a heavy Nordic strain was still present. He characterized the French as possessing the following racial proportions: Nordic, 25%; Alpine or Dinaric, 50%; Mediterranean, 25%. These types were said to be most prevalent in north, central, and southern France respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther 1927, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler planned to remove a large portion of the French population to make way for German settlement. The [[Zone interdite]] of eastern France was set aside and planned to be made part of the German Reich after the rest of France was fully subdued. The French residents of the zone, some 7 million people accounting for nearly 20% of the French population at the time, were to be deported, and the land then occupied by at least a million German settlers. The plan was either postponed or abandoned after Operation Barbarossa in favor of expediting the settlement of the east instead, and was never put into place owing to the German defeat in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Kroener, Bernhard R.; Müller, Rolf-Dieter; Umbreit, Hans (2000). "Germany and the Second World War: Organization and mobilization of the German sphere of power. Wartime administration, economy, and manpower resources 1939-1941." Oxford University Press. pp. 160–162. {{ISBN|0-19-822887-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mediterranean Aryans ===
The Nazis regarded central/southern Italians, Spanish, Portuguese, southern French, and Greeks as sharing a similar origin with Germans from ancient Indo-Aryan migration, but being almost purely of a distinct so-called [[Mediterranean race]]. Despite classifying these populations as Aryans, and regarding them as superior in the arts compared to Nordics and Germans, the Nazis considered them less industrious than predominantly Nordic peoples like the Germans and English, and thus marginally inferior to the Nordic race. The "Mediterranean" race was described in Nazi propaganda as brown-haired, brown-eyed, brownish-skinned, and short (average 162&amp;nbsp;cm), with dolichocephalic or [[Cephalic index#Indices|mesocephalic]] skulls, and lean builds. People of this category were described as "lively, even loquacious" and "excitable, even passionate", but "prone to act more on feeling than on reason", and as a result, "this race has produced only a few outstanding men."&lt;ref&gt;Harwood L. Childs (translator). "The Nazi Primer." New York: Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, 1938. Page 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Tyrol Option Agreement|question of South Tyrol]] was largely dealt by Hitler and Mussolini pragmatically: this region of Austria's Tyrol, annexed by Italy after 1919, would not become a constituent district of [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]] (present-day Austria). Ethnic Germans in South Tyrol were given the option of either migrating back to the German Reich or remaining in South Tyrol to undergo forced Italianization.

===Persians===
Beginning in 1933, the Nazi leadership in Germany made efforts to increase their influence in Iran, and they financed and managed a racist journal, ''Iran-e Bastan'', co-edited by a pro-Nazi Iranian, Sheikh Abdul-Rahman Seif. This and other [[chauvinistic]] publications in the 1930s were popular among Iranian elites; they "highlighted the past and the pre-Islamic glories of the Persian nation and blamed the supposedly 'savage Arabs and Turks' for the backwardness of Iran."&lt;ref name="Irani"&gt;Asgharzadeh, Alireza. ''[https://books.google.ca/books?id=apODDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92 Iran and the Challenge of Diversity: Islamic Fundamentalism, Aryanist Racism, and Democratic Struggles]''. Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 91-94.&lt;/ref&gt; In Iran:

{{quote|The Nazis found a favorable climate amongst the Iranian elite to spread fascistic and racist propaganda. The [[Nazi propaganda]] machine advocated the (supposedly) common Aryan ancestry of "the two Nations." In order to further cultivate racist tendencies, in 1936 the [[Hitler Cabinet|Reich Cabinet]] issued a special decree exempting Iranians from the restrictions of the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Racial Laws]] on the grounds that they were 'pure-blooded' Aryans ... In various pro-Nazi publications, lectures, speeches, and ceremonies, parallels were drawn among [[Reza Shah]], Hitler, and Mussolini to emphasize the charismatic resemblance among these leaders."&lt;ref name="Irani"/&gt;}}

Nazi ideology was most common among Persian officials, elites, and intellectuals, but "even some members of [[Ethnic minorities in Iran|non-Persian groups]] were eager to identify themselves with the Nazis" and a supposed Aryan race.&lt;ref name="Irani"/&gt;  Hitler declared Iran to be an "Aryan state"; the changing of Persia's name to Iran in 1935 was done by the Shah at the suggestion of the German ambassador to Iran as an act of "Aryan solidarity."&lt;ref name="Iran"&gt;Hiro, Dilip. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NCwOAAAAQAAJ Iran Under the Ayatollahs]''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Inc., p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the [[Rassenpolitisches Amt|Nazi Office of Racial Politics]], in response to a question from the German Foreign Ministry, classified non-Jewish Turks as Europeans, but "left unanswered the question of how to think about the obviously non-European Arabs, Persians, and Muslims."&lt;ref name="Herf"&gt;Jeffrey Herf, ''Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World'' (Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 18-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the year, ahead of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] in Berlin, the Nazis responded to questions from the [[Egypt]]ians by saying that the Nuremberg racial laws did not apply to them, and after the Iranian ambassador to Berlin "assured German officials that 'there was no doubt that the Iranian, as an Aryan,' was 'racially kindred (''artverwandt'') with the Germans," the German Foreign Ministry "assured the Iranian Embassy in Berlin that the correct distinction between was not between "Aryans and non-Aryans" but rather between "persons of German and related blood on one hand and Jews as well as racially alien on the other."&lt;ref name="Herf"/&gt;

Historian [[Jeffrey Herf]] writes:

{{quote|As a result of the discussions of spring and summer 1936, Nazi officials had reassured Arab diplomats that Nazi ideology and policy were directed against the Jews, not non-Jewish Semites. Nazism viewed Arabs and Muslims as different but, in clear contrast to the racial hierarchy presented in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', not as racially inferior. But as it was best that races not mix, non-Jewish Germans should marry other non-Jewish Germans. These abstruse discussions of the meaning of blood and race in summer 1936 offered a legal and conceptual foundation for reconciling German racial ideology and legislation with close and ongoing work with non-Jewish Semites, that is, Arabs and Muslims, before and during World War II. As a consequence of the exchanges of spring and summer 1936 and the Egyptian and Iranian decisions to attend the summer Olympics, German officials learned that they could reconcile Nazi Germany's anti-Jewish policies with efforts to find allies among non-Jewish Semites. They also learned that at least some Arab and Persian diplomats had no principled opposition to anti-Semitism so long as it was only aimed at Jews and even had become accustomed to thinking about peoples and nations in the racist categories emerging from the National Socialist regime.&lt;ref name="Herf"/&gt;}}

{{Race}}

===Non-Aryans: Japanese and Chinese===
In [[Adolf Hitler]]'s own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pride in one's own race – and that does not imply contempt for other races – is also a normal and healthy sentiment. I have never regarded the Chinese or the Japanese as being inferior to ourselves. They belong to ancient civilizations, and I admit freely that their past history is superior to our own. They have the right to be proud of their past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilization to which we belong. Indeed, I believe the more steadfast the Chinese and the Japanese remain in their pride of race, the easier I shall find it to get on with them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler, Adolf]] (February – April 1945) ''The Political Testament of Adolf Hitler'', Note #5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hitler had supported the [[Empire of Japan]] as early as 1904, when during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] it had defeated the [[Russian Empire]], which he considered a defeat for [[Austro-Slavism|Austrian Slavism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Mein Kampf | author = Adolf Hitler | year = 1925 | chapter = The World War | quote = When the Russo-Japanese War came I was older and better able to judge for myself. For national reasons I then took the side of the Japanese in our discussions.

Although of a different race, the Japanese were considered by Nazi ideologists such as [[Heinrich Himmler]], the head of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], as having sufficiently superior qualities to warrant an alliance. Himmler, who had a great interest in, and was influenced by, the anthropology, [[East Asian philosophy|philosophies]] and pantheistic [[East Asian religion|religions]] of [[East Asia]], mentioned how his friend [[Hiroshi Ōshima]], the [[List of Japanese ministers, envoys and ambassadors to Germany|Japanese Ambassador to Germany]], believed that the noble castes in Japan, the [[Daimyō]] and the [[Samurai]], were descended from gods of celestial origin, which was similar to Himmler's own belief that "the Nordic race did not evolve, but came directly down from heaven to settle on the [[Atlantis|Atlantic continent]]."&lt;ref name="report"&gt;''The Activities of Dr. Ernst Schaefer'', OI - Final Interrogation Report (OI-FIR) No. 32, Secret - United States Forces European Theater Military Intelligence Service Center APO 757, February 12, 1946, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Haushofer]], a German general, geographer, and geopolitician, whose ideas influenced the development of Hitler's expansionist views, saw Japan as the brother nation to Germany. In 1908, he was sent by the German Army "to Tokyo to study the Japanese Army and to advise it as an artillery instructor. The assignment changed the course of his life and marked the beginning of his love affair with the orient. During the next four years he traveled extensively in East Asia, adding Korean, Japanese, and Mandarin to his repertoire of Russian, French, and English languages. Karl Haushofer had been a devout student of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and during his stay in the Far East he was introduced to Oriental esoteric teachings."&lt;ref&gt;''The Swastika and the Nazi's'', Servando González, Chapter 2: The Haushofer Connection, 1997-1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these views, the Japanese were still subject to Germany's [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial laws]], however, which &amp;ndash; with the exception of the 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]], which specifically mentioned Jews &amp;ndash; generally applied to all "non-Aryans". Hitler's government began enacting the laws after taking power in 1933, and the Japanese government protested several racial incidents involving Japanese or Japanese-Germans that year. Influential Nazi anti-Semite [[Johann von Leers]] favored excluding Japanese from the laws due both to the alleged Japanese-Aryan racial link and to improve diplomatic relations with Japan. The [[German Foreign Ministry|Foreign Ministry]] agreed with von Leers and sought several times between 1934 and 1937 to change the laws, but other government agencies, including the [[Racial Policy Office]], opposed the change.{{r|furuya2000}}

An October 1933 statement by [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] [[Konstantin von Neurath]] which falsely claimed in response to the Japanese protests that Japanese were exempt, however, was widely publicized and caused many in Germany, Japan, and elsewhere to believe that such an exemption existed. Instead of a broad exemption, an April 1935 decree stated that racial discrimination cases involving non-Aryans that might jeopardize German diplomatic relations&amp;mdash;i.e., Japanese&amp;mdash;would be dealt with individually. Decisions on such cases often took years, with those affected unable to obtain jobs or interracially marry, primarily because the German government preferred as much as possible to avoid giving exemptions. The German government often exempted more German-Japanese than it preferred in order to avoid a repeat of the 1933 controversies, and in 1934 it [[Censorship in Nazi Germany|prohibited the German press]] from discussing the race laws when Japanese were involved.&lt;ref name="furuya2000"&gt;{{cite book | title=Japanese Prisoners of War | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |editor1=Towle, Philip |editor2=Kosuge, Margaret |editor3=Kibata, Yōichi | author=Furuya, Harumi | chapter=Japan's Racial Identity in the Second World War: The Cultural Context of the Japanese Treatment of POWs | year=2000 | pages=123–124, 126–130, 132–134 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktCv32ysz0AC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn=1-85285-192-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subhuman: Romani, Slavs and Jews ===
The Nazis thought Eastern Europe, namely the areas speaking [[Slavic languages]], to be racially the lowest part of Europe, and very distinct from the rest of Europe {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Hans Günther stated: "The east of Europe shows a gradual transition of the racial mixtures of Central Europe into predominantly [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]] and [[Neo-Mongoloid|Inner Asiatic]] regions... Owing to the likeness between East Baltic and Inner Asiatic bodily characters it will often be hard to fix a sharp boundary between these two races." Russia was thought to be 25% Nordic, other regions less.&lt;ref name=gunther171&gt;Günther (1927), p.171-72 (Chapter 10)ü&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jews]], [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Slavs]] (including [[Poles]], [[Serbs]] and [[Russians]]) were not considered Aryans by Nazi Germany but as subhuman, inferior races.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Dictionary of the Holocaust - Page 175 Jack R.

Hitler shifted the blame of Germany's loss in the First World War upon "enemies from within". In the face of economic hardship as triggered by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919), Jews who resided in Germany were blamed for sabotaging the country. The Nazis therefore classified them as the most inferior race and used derogatory terms ''[[Untermensch]]'' (sub-human) and ''Schwein'' (pig).

To expand the ''Lebensraum'' (living space) for Germans, the Nazis later applied this classification to [[Slavs]], mainly the Poles, Serbs and Russians, along with [[Romani people|Romani (Gypsies)]] east of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B000MC6M5S|title=Der Mythos des 20.

An ''Untermensch'' would be stripped of all his/her rights, treated as an animal, deemed to have a ''[[Life unworthy of life|Lebensunwertes Leben]]'' (life unworthy of living) and fit only for enslavement and extermination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mineau|first=André|title=Operation Barbarossa: Ideology and Ethics Against Human Dignity|year=2004|publisher=Rodopi|location=Amsterdam; New York|isbn=90-420-1633-7|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Piotr"&gt;{{cite web | title=Project InPosterum: Poland WWII Casualties | first=Tadeusz | last=Piotrowski | authorlink=Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist) | year=2005 | url=http://www.projectinposterum.org/docs/poland_WWII_casualties.htm | accessdate=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Łuczak | first = Czesław | authorlink= Czesław Łuczak| title = Szanse i trudności bilansu demograficznego Polski w latach 1939–1945 | journal = Dzieje Najnowsze | issue = 1994/2 | year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simone Gigliotti 2005.

Nazi ideology taught the German youth during school to understand the differences between the Nordic German "Übermenschen" and "ignoble" Jewish and Slavic "subhumans".&lt;ref&gt;Hitler Youth, 1922–1945: An Illustrated History by Jean-Denis Lepage, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Subhuman: Poles ====
Pseudoscientist and Nazi geneticist Hans Günther, on whom Hitler based much of his ideology, wrote extensively about the supposed racial origins of the Poles and other West Slavs. Originally, the West Slavs were supposed to be Nordic, but were diluted by mixture with inferior races starting in the 12th century. The dominant type among Poles in the modern day then became the [[East Baltic race]].&lt;ref name=gunther171 /&gt; However, some Poles were considered to have enough Nordic admixture to be assimilated, supposedly being descended from the Nordic ruling class of the old West Slavs. Others, especially in the southern regions of the country, had a strong amount of "Inner Asiatic" racial ancestry, and as East Baltic/Inner Asiatic mixes were the most inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Günther (1927), p.74 (Chapter 6)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Poles and predominantly East Baltic people in general, Günther said that they were mentally slow and incapable of long term planning, which influenced Nazi perception of the Poles: "after weeks of dreary toil the East Baltic man will often heedlessly squander all that he has earned... 'Nihilism' lies deep in the East Baltic soul. He seldom knows how to keep the wealth he has earned; riches make him extravagant and fond of show. His mind is not capable of quick decision, but with all its slowness it is penetrating...  He has little cleanliness, whether personal or in the home."&lt;ref&gt;Günther (1927), p.41 (Chapter 3)&lt;/ref&gt; He also characterized Poles as predisposed to violence, and blamed crime in the German border regions on racemixing, saying: "The East Baltic man inclines to brutality in his sexual relations, and, indeed, to brutality in general. The German districts with most East Baltic blood have a heavy proportion of crime."&lt;ref&gt;Günther (1927), p.40 (Chapter 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Racialist ideology ==
{{see also|Racial policy of Nazi Germany}}

=== Ideology ===
Different Nazis offered a range of arguments—some pseudo-religious, others pseudoscientific—as to why the Aryan or European people were racially superior to people of other races. But the central dogma of Aryan superiority was espoused by officials throughout the party.

[[Richard Walther Darré]], Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture from 1933 to 1942, popularized the expression ''"[[Blut und Boden]]"'' ("Blood and Soil"), one of the many terms of the [[Nazi glossary]] [[ideology|ideologically]] used to enforce popular [[racism]] in the German population.  There were many academic and administrative scholars of race who all had somewhat divergent views about the social misconception of racism, including [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Hans F. K. Günther]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh|Burleigh, Michael]] (1996) ''Confronting the Nazi Past: New Debates on Modern German History''.  New York: St. Martin's Press.  {{ISBN|0-312-16353-3}}. p.199 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer and Lenz were appointed to senior positions overseeing the policy of [[racial hygiene]]. The Nazi state used such ideas about the differences between European races as part of their various discriminatory and coercive policies which culminated in [[the Holocaust]]. Ironically, in Grant's {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} first edition of his popular book ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} he classified Germans as being primarily Nordic, but in his second edition, published after the USA had entered WWI, he had re-classified the now enemy power as being dominated by "inferior" Alpines, a tradition evident in the work of Harvard Professor of Anthropology [[Carlton Coon]]'s work, ''The Races of Europe''.

Günther's work stated that the Germans are definitely not a fully Nordic people, and divided them into Western (Mediterranean), Nordic, Eastern (Alpine), East Baltic and Dinaric races. Hitler himself was later to downplay the importance of Nordicism in public for this very reason. The simplistic tripartite model of Grant which divided Europeans into only Alpine, Mediterranean, and Nordic, Günther did not use, and erroneously placed most of the population of Hitler's Germany in the Alpine category, especially after the [[Anschluss]]. This has been used to downplay the Nordic presence in Germany. Gunther considered Jews an "Asiatic race inferior to all European races".&lt;ref&gt;Anton Wendt, Eradicating Differences, p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Kaup led a movement opposed to Günther. Kaup took the view that a German nation, all of whose citizens belonged to a "German race" in a populationist sense, offered a more convenient sociotechnical tool than Günther's concept of an ideal Nordic type to which only a very few Germans could belong. Nazi legislation identifying the ethnic and "racial" affinities of the Jews reflects the populationist concept of race. Discrimination was not restricted to Jews who belonged to the "Semitic-Oriental-Armenoid" and/or "Nubian-African/Negroid" races, but was directed against all members of the Jewish ethnic population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiercinski|first=Andrzej|last2=Bielicki|first2=Tadeusz|author2-link=|title=The Racial Analysis of Human Populations in Relation to Their Ethnogenesis|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2, 9–46|date=February 1962|doi=10.1086/200244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Jewish journalist Kurt Caro (1905–1979) who emigrated to Paris in 1933 and served in the British army from 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Kurt Caro | work =| publisher =[[German Federal Archives]] | url = https://www.bundesarchiv.de/aktenreichskanzlei/1919-1933/0001/adr/adrag/kap1_3/para2_16.html |accessdate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a book under the pseudonym Manuel Humbert unmasking Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in which he stated the following racial composition of the Jewish population of Central Europe: 23.8% Lapponoid race, 21.5% Nordic race,
20.3% Armenoid race, 18.4% Mediterranean race, 16.0% Oriental race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hitler's "Mein Kampf". Dichtung und Wahrheit|first=Manuel|last=Humbert|publisher=Kurt Michael Caro|year=1936|location=Paris|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1939 Hitler had abandoned Nordicist rhetoric in favour of the idea that the German people as a whole were united by distinct "spiritual" qualities. Nevertheless, Nazi eugenics policies continued to favor Nordics over Alpines and other racial groups, particularly during the war when decisions were being made about the incorporation of conquered peoples into the Reich. The [[Lebensborn]] program sought to extend the Nordic race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Gumkowski| first =Janusz| authorlink =|author2=Kazimierz Leszczynski | title = Poland under Nazi Occupation | work =| publisher =| url =http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |accessdate=19 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527021449/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm|archivedate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Crossland | first =David| authorlink = | title = Nazi Program to breed Master race, Lebensborn Children Break Silence | work =Der Spiegel| publisher =| url =http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,446978,00.html |accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Opening Statement of the Prosecution in the Einsatzgruppen Trial| work =Nuremberg Trial Documents| publisher =| url =http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/einsatzopenpros.html| accessdate =20 July 2007| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070417023514/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/einsatzopenpros.html| archivedate =17 April 2007| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 Hitler stated in private, &lt;blockquote&gt;I shall have no peace of mind until I have planted a seed of Nordic blood wherever the population stand in need of regeneration.

Hitler and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] planned to use the [[SS]] as the basis for the racial "regeneration" of Europe following the final victory of Nazism. The SS was to be a racial elite chosen on the basis of "pure" Nordic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hale| first = Christopher| title = Himmler's Crusade | publisher = Bantam Press| year = 2003| pages = 74–87 | isbn = 0-593-04952-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell| first = Stuart| authorlink = | title = Heinrich Himmler's Camelot| publisher = Kressman-Backmayer| year = 1999| pages =| isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Geoffrey G.|title=Nordic Racism|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=523|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing officers of the [[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|SS-Leibstandarte "Adolf Hitler"]] Himmler stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ultimate aim for those 11 years during which I have been the Reichsfuehrer SS has been invariably the same: to create an order of good blood which is able to serve Germany; which unfailingly and without sparing itself can be made use of because the greatest losses can do no harm to the vitality of this order, the vitality of these men, because they will always be replaced; to create an order which will spread the idea of Nordic blood so far that we will attract all Nordic blood in the world, take away the blood from our adversaries, absorb it so that never again, looking at it from the viewpoint of grand policy, Nordic blood, in great quantities and to an extent worth mentioning, will fight against us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression|volume=IV|location=USGPO, Washington|date=1946|pages=553–572|work=|publisher=University of North Carolina at Charlotte|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/SS1.htm DOCUMENT 1918-PS|accessdate=19 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817233423/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/SS1.htm|archivedate=17 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An influential figure among German racist theorists was [[Otto Reche]] who became director of the Institute for Racial and Ethnic Sciences in [[Lipsk]] and advocated the [[genocide]] of the Polish nation. In this position he wrote that ethnic Poles were "an unfortunate mixture" consisting among others of Slavs, Balts and Mongolians, and that they should be ''eliminated'' to avoid possible mixing with the ''German race''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=The History of a Forgotten German Camp: Nazi Ideology and Genocide at Szmalcowka|first1=Tomasz |last1=Ceran |page=40 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Germany invaded Poland he wrote "We need Raum (space), but no Polish lice on our fur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first1=Anton |last1=Weiss-Wendt|title=Eradicating Differences: The Treatment of Minorities in Nazi-Dominated Europe|page=66|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy==
Philosophers and other theoreticians participated in the elaboration of Nazi ideology. The relationship between [[Heidegger and Nazism]] has remained a controversial subject in the [[history of philosophy]], even today. According to the philosopher Emmanuel Faye, Heidegger said of [[Spinoza]] that he was "''ein Fremdkörper in der Philosophie''", a "foreign body in philosophy"{{spaced ndash}}Faye notes that ''Fremdkörper'' was a term which belonged to the [[Nazi glossary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmanuel Faye |title=Heidegger, L'Introduction Du Nazisme Dans La Philosophie|language=French|publisher=Albin Michel|year=2005|isbn=978-2-226-14252-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Nazi Foundations in Heidegger's Work|date=2006|volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=55–66 |doi=10.1353/scr.2006.0006 |last1=Faye |first1=Emmanuel |last2=Watson |first2=Alexis |last3=Golsan |first3=Richard Joseph |journal=South Central Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not to classical German. However Heidegger did to a certain extent criticise racial science, particularly in his Nietzsche lectures, which reject biologism in general. While generally speaking even in Heidegger's most German nationalist and pro-Nazi works of the early 30s, such as his infamous Rectorial address there is a lack of any overtly racialised language. Thus it is problematic to connect Heidegger with any racial theory.  [[Carl Schmitt]] elaborated a [[philosophy of law]] praising the ''Führerprinzip'' and the German people, while [[Alfred Baeumler]] instrumentalized [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's thought]], in particular his concept of the "''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|Will to Power]]''", in an attempt to justify Nazism.

== Propaganda and implementation of racial theories ==

{{Main|Racial policy of Nazi Germany}}
Nazis developed an elaborate system of [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]] to diffuse these theories. [[Nazi architecture]], for example, was used to create the "new order" and improve the "Aryan race." Sports were also seen by the Nazis as a way to "regenerate the race" by exposing supposedly inferior peoples, namely the Jews, as slovenly, sedentary and out-of-shape. The [[Hitler Youth]], founded in 1922, had among its basic motivations the training of future "Aryan supermen" and future soldiers who would faithfully fight for the Third Reich.

[[Nazism and cinema|Cinema]] was also used to promote racist theories, under the direction of [[Joseph Goebbels]]' [[Propagandaministerium]]. The [[German Hygiene Museum]] in Dresden diffused racial theories. A 1934 poster of the museum shows a man with distinctly African features and reads, "If this man had been sterilized there would not have been born ... 12 hereditarily diseased."''(sic)''&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{Cite news|last=Rietschel|first=Matthias|title=Nazi racial purity exhibit opens in Germany|newspaper=MSNBC|location=Dresden, Germany|publisher=The Associated Press|date=9 October 2006|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15197604/|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the current director Klaus Voegel, "The Hygiene Museum was not a criminal institute in the sense that people were killed here," but "it helped to shape the idea of which lives were worthy and which were worthless."&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt;

Nazi racial theories soon translated into legislation, most notably with the 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]] and the July 1933 [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]]. The [[Aktion T4]] euthanasia programme, in which the ''[[Kraft durch Freude]]'' (KdF, literally "Strength Through Joy") youth organisation participated, targeted people accused of representing a danger of "[[degeneration]]" towards the "[[Volksdeutsche|Deutsche Volk]]." Under the race laws, sexual relations between Aryans (cf. [[Aryan certificate]]) and non-Aryans known as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("race defilement") became punishable by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Proctor|title=Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-74578-0|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bankier|author2=Israel Gutman|title=Nazi Europe and the Final Solution|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-410-4|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve the "racial purity" of the German blood, after the beginning of the war the Nazis extended the race defilement law to include all foreigners (non-Germans).&lt;ref name="Majer2003"&gt;{{cite book|author = Diemut Majer | title = "Non-Germans" Under the Third Reich: The Nazi Judicial and Administrative System in Germany and Occupied Eastern Europe with Special Regard to Occupied Poland, 1939-1945 | year = 2003|publisher = JHU Press | isbn=978-0-8018-6493-3 | page = 180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the laws against ''Rassenschande'', allegations of rape against Jewish women during the Holocaust by Nazi soldiers have surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/06/24/holocaust.rape/|title=Silence lifted: The untold stories of rape during the Holocaust|first=By Jessica Ravitz,|last=CNN|date=|website=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi regime called for all German people wanting to be citizens of the Reich to produce proof of [[Ariernachweis|Aryan ancestry]], certain exceptions were made when Hitler issued the "[[German Blood Certificate]]" for those people classified by the race laws to be of partial Aryan and Jewish ancestry.

During World War II, [[Germanization]] efforts were carried out in central and eastern Europe to cull those of "German blood" there. This started with the classification of people into the [[Volksliste]]. Those selected were either sent for Germanization, or killed to prevent "German blood" being used against the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fundamentalbass.home.mindspring.com/c9052.htm Nazi Conspiracy &amp; Aggression Volume I Chapter XIII Germanization &amp; Spoliation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031203151512/http://fundamentalbass.home.mindspring.com/c9052.htm |date=3 December 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions of Poland, many Poles were either murdered or deported to make room for [[Baltic Germans]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn H.

Nicholas]], ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p. 207-9 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to identify people of German descent with Nordic traits from pre-war citizens of Poland, once chosen if the individual passed the screening process test of being considered "racially valuable" they were then [[Kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi Germany|abducted from their parents]] to be [[Germanized]] and then sent to Germany to be raised as Germans, those children who failed racist tests were used as test subjects in medical experiments or used as slaves in German industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph W.

Berghahn, "Germans and Poles 1871–1945", in Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identities and Cultural Differences. New York and Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Western countries, such as France, were treated less roughly because they were viewed as racially superior to the "subhuman" Poles that were to be enslaved and exterminated, though not as good as full Germans; [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany#Germanization between 1939 and 1945|a complex of racial categories]] was boiled down by the average German to mean "East is bad and West is acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn H. Nicholas]], ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p. 263 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, extensive racial classification was practiced in France, for future uses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn H.

{{Communism sidebar}}
The '''new class''' is used as a [[polemic]] term by [[critics]] of [[countries]] that followed the Soviet type of [[Communism]] to describe the privileged [[ruling class]] of [[bureaucrat]]s and [[Communist Party]] [[functionaries]] which arose in these [[Communist state|states]]. Generally, the group known in the [[Soviet Union]] as the [[nomenklatura]] conforms to the theory of the new class. The term was earlier applied to other emerging strata of the society.

[[Milovan Đilas]]' "New Class" theory was also used extensively by [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] commentators in the West in their criticism of the Communist states during the [[Cold War]].

The term "[[Red flag (politics)|red]] [[bourgeoisie]]" is a [[pejorative]] [[synonym]] for the term new class, crafted by leftist critics and movements (like the [[1968 student demonstrations in Belgrade]]).

New class is also used as a term in late 1960s [[post-industrial]] [[sociology]].

==  Milovan Đilas' ''New Class'' ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
A theory of the new class was developed by [[Milovan Đilas]] the Vice President of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]], who participated with Tito in the [[Yugoslav People's Liberation War]], but was later [[purge]]d by him as Đilas began to advocate [[democracy|democratic]] and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] ideals (which he believed were more in line with the way [[socialism]] and [[communism]] should look like). However, there were also personal antagonisms between the two men, and Tito felt Đilas undermined his leadership. The theory of the new class can be considered to oppose the theories of certain ruling Communists, such as [[Joseph Stalin]], who argued that their revolutions and/or social reforms would result in the extinction of any ruling class as such.&lt;ref name=EvR2002page138&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political Thought of Joseph Stalin: A Study in Twentieth Century Revolutionary Patriotism|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700717491|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GY6bWw_tLf0C&amp;pg=PA138 |author=Erik van Ree|edition=1st|page=138|format=hardcover|date=October 28, 2002|quote=Stalin saw the Soviet state after the demise of classes as a classless institution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EvR2002page141&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political Thought of Joseph Stalin: A Study in Twentieth Century Revolutionary Patriotism|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700717491|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GY6bWw_tLf0C&amp;pg=PA138 |author=Erik van Ree|edition=1st|page=141|format=hardcover|date=October 28, 2002|quote=..."in essence" there was "no dictatorship of the proletariat now either. We have a Soviet democracy". The reason was that there were only external enemies to suppress. (quote from Stalin, May, 1946)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Đilas' observation as a member of a Communist government that Party members stepped into the role of ruling class &amp;ndash; a problem which he believed should be corrected through revolution. Đilas' completed his primary work on his new class theory in the mid-1950s. While Đilas was in prison, it was published in 1957 in the West under the title ''[[The New Class: An Analysis of the Communist System]]''.

Đilas claimed that the new class' specific relationship to the [[means of production]] was one of collective political control, and that the new class' property form was political control. Thus for Đilas the new class not only seeks expanded material reproduction to politically justify its existence to the [[working class]], but it also seeks expanded reproduction of political control as a form of property in itself. This can be compared to the capitalist who seeks expanded value through increased sharemarket values, even though the sharemarket itself does not necessarily reflect an increase in the value of commodities produced. Đilas uses this argument about property forms to indicate why the new class sought parades, marches and spectacles despite this activity lowering the levels of material productivity.

Đilas proposed that the new class only slowly came to self-consciousness of itself as a class. On arriving at a full self-consciousness the initial project undertaken would be massive [[industrialisation]] in order to cement the external security of the new class' rule against foreign or alternative ruling classes.  In Đilas' schema this approximated the 1930s and 1940s in the Soviet Union. As the new class suborns all other interests to its own security during this period, it freely executes and purges its own members in order to achieve its major goal of security as a ruling class.

After security has been achieved, the new class pursues a policy of moderation towards its own members, effectively granting material rewards and freedom of thought and action within the new class{{spaced ndash}}so long as this freedom is not used to undermine the rule of the new class. Đilas identified this period as the period of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]]'s government in the Soviet Union. Due to the emergence of conflicts of policy within the new class, the potential for palace coups, or populist revolutions is possible (as experienced in Poland and Hungary respectively).

Finally Đilas predicted a period of economic decline, as the political future of the new class was consolidated around a staid programme of corruption and self-interest at the expense of other social classes. This can be interpreted as a prediction of the [[Leonid Brezhnev]] so-called [[Era of Stagnation]] by Đilas.

While Đilas claimed that the new class was a social class with a distinct relationship to the [[means of production]], he did not claim that this new class was associated with a self-sustaining [[mode of production]]. This claim, within [[Marxist]] theory, argues that the Soviet-style societies must eventually either collapse backwards towards capitalism, or experience a social revolution towards real [[socialism]]. This can be seen as a prediction of the downfall of the Soviet Union.

[[Robert D. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan's]] 1993 book ''Balkan Ghosts: A Journey through history'' also contains a discussion with Đilas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/djilasZA.html A discussion with Milovan Đilas], from ''Balkan Ghosts'' by Robert Kaplan, St. Martin's Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; who used his model to anticipate many of the events that subsequently came to pass in the former Yugoslavia.

Marxists, like [[Ernest Mandel]], have criticised Djilas for ignoring the existence of a new socio-economic system, which cannot be reconciled with the old class system.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ernestmandel.org/en/works/txt/1979/soviet_bureaucracy.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Similarity to other analyses==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
Of course, the specific notions of Đilas are his own development, however the idea that bureaucrats in a typical Marxist–Leninist style state become a new class is not his original idea. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] had made this point in his [[International Workingmen's Association]] debates with Marx in the mid-to-late 19th century.  This idea was repeated after the Russian revolution by anarchists like [[Kropotkin]] and [[Makhno]], as well as some Marxists. In 1911 [[Robert Michels]] first proposed the [[Iron law of oligarchy]], which described the development of bureaucratic hierarchies in supposedly egalitarian and democratic [[socialist]] parties. It was later repeated by a leader of the Russian Revolution, [[Leon Trotsky]] through his theory of [[degenerated workers state]]. Further on, [[Mao Zedong]] also had his own version of this idea developed during the [[Socialist Education Movement]] to criticize the [[Communist Party of China]] under [[Liu Shaoqi]]. Of course, this wide range of people over the decades had different perspectives on the matter, but there was also a degree of core agreement on this idea.

From the other side of the fence, the work of [[Friedrich Hayek]] also anticipated many of Đilas' New Class criticisms, without placing them in a Marxist context (see esp. ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]''). American [[neoconservatives]] adapted New Class analysis in their theory of the [[managerial state]]. [[Karl Popper]]'s criticisms of utopian social pursuits in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' are markedly similar to Đilas' views, which were nonetheless developed independently (see note 6 to Chapter 18 of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' and related text).

== John Kenneth Galbraith and post-industrial sociology ==
Canadian-American liberal economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] also wrote about a similar phenomenon under Capitalism, the emergence of a technocratic layer in ''[[The New Industrial State]]'' and ''[[The Affluent Society]]''.

The "New Class" model as a theory of new social groups in post-industrial societies gained ascendency during the 1970s as social and political scientists noted how "New Class" groups were shaped by post-material orientations in their pursuit of political and social goals (Bruce-Briggs, B. The New Class? New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction. 1979).  New Class themes "no longer have a direct relationship to the imperatives of economic security" (Inglehart, Ronald. 'The Silent Revolution in Europe: the intergenerational change in post-industrial society'. American Political Science Review. 65. 1971:991-1017).

'''Obaala''' (or in Yoruba orthography '''Ọbaálá''') is a senior title in the royal council of many kingdoms of the northeastern [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] - the [[Igbomina]], [[Ijesha|Ijẹṣa]] and [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]] sub-ethnics.

Ọbaálá literally means "mighty king" or "senior king" and is almost always next in rank to the  high king or paramount king of the areas where the title is used. The Ọbaálá is often designated as the automatic regent on the demise of any reigning king or paramount king.

The most famous Ọbaálá in recent Yoruba history is easily Ogedengbe, the Ijẹṣa war commander who co-led the "Ekiti Parapọ", a clan confederation which stood to oppose the imperialism of 19th century [[Ibadan]].

'''Pashto media''' includes [[Pashto literature and poetry|Pashto literature]], [[Pashto language|Pashto-language]] newspapers, magazines, television and radio stations, as well as Pashto films and Pashto internet. Pashto media involves the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] of [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Pashtun diaspora]] around the world.

== Pashto literature and poetry ==
{{Pashtuns}}
{{Main|Pashto literature and poetry}}

Pashto is not only the name of a language, but it comprises all traditions, norms and values of the [[Pashtun people]]. The history of [[Pashto language]] comprises thousands of years. It is widely believed among the Pashtuns that the earliest written Pashto poems were written in the 8th century CE by [[Amir Kror Suri]] of [[Ghor Province|Ghor]], Afghanistan. Amir Kror was the son of Amir Polad and they belonged to the [[Suri (Pashtun)|Suri]] [[Pashtun tribe]]. Since paper was not much in use in the Pashtun territory, Poets usually performed poetry verbally and its fans memorized the work. Another reason may be that most Pashtuns were [[nomad]]s and warriors, thus lack writing skills. Due to these and other reasons, Pashto remained as a verbal language only. The poems by Amir Kror Suri were discovered and saved in [[Pata Khazana]], a work compiled by Shah [[Hussain Hotaki]] and last edited by professor [[Abdul Hai Habibi]] from [[Kandahar]]. [[Abu Muhammad Hashim Sarwani]] was another poet of that period. He was born around the [[Helmand Province]] in the 9th century. He was the student of [[Ullema of Basat]]. It is also said that he was the student of popular Arabic writer, [[Ibn-e-Khalid]]. Hashim Sarwani translated some Arabic poems in Pashto, and his work also came under light through the book, Pata Khazana. He also wrote a book, [[SaloVagma]], meaning ‘deserted breeze’ on the eloquence of Arabic verses. After Abu Muhammad Hashim Sarwani, [[Sheikh Razi]] is another poet whose work is saved in the book, Pata Khazana. He belonged to the [[Lodi (Pashtun tribe)|Lodi]] tribe of Pashtuns. Similarly, there are many other poets in the first phase of Pashto poetry (i.e. Amir Nasir Lodhi, Beat Neeka, Ismail Ster Bani (son of Beat Neeka), Kharshaboon (cousin of Ismail Ster Bani), Sheikh Asad Soori and others).
غازی ارسلاخان اتمانخيل دلورالای دباچاخان لاروی  وواودلارډسفورډانګليس سره يی شکر په شکر کښي ورکړيوو

Intellectual, scholars and critics divide Pashto literature into two parts, i.e. poetry and prose. Poetic literature like [[Amir Crore Nazam]] and [[Sheikh Mati Munajat]] were all in poetic form. Prose found its place in Pashto literature very late. The reason is that poetry is a far common and effective genre for translating and expressing one’s feeling into it and conveying the same to others. However prose vis-à-vis poetry appeals to a very selective mind and heart. Now the question arises as to when prose writing came into vogue in Pashto literature. There are various profound claims and arguments regarding the origin of prose in Pashto literature like it having been originated as back as 223 Hijri in the form of translation of Arabic verses in book titled ‘SaloVagma’ (Deserted Breeze). Since the book is not vogue and the idea is based on mere assumption, it cannot be taken as authentic. Similarly, another book [[Tazkiratul Aulia]], written by [[Suleman Makoo]] in 612 Hijri, is said to be the first recognized book in Pashto. The book contains descriptions of major [[Aulia]], like Shiekh Malkair, Shiekh Ismial and Sheikh Bakhtiar. The complete book is not in existence but a part of it is available. However, the oldest complete prose book in Pashto that is still in existence today is [[Khairul Bayan]]. After that we come across [[Akhund Darvez]]’s book title [[Makhzanul Islam]] and various other books written in the 9th and 10th centuries by [[Babu Jan]], [[Mlamast Zamand]], [[Allah Yar]], and [[Akhun Qasim]]. But all these books were in prose-verse as they contained difficult words and rhetorical expressions and poetic rhythms as well. After that comes the era of the great Pashto poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], who along with his family has made a remarkable contribution to Pashto prose writing. His sons, one of his daughters, Haleema Khatak and his grandchildren (Khushaal Khan Khatak’s) contributed to Pashto prose in an especially unique way. It was this period when prose was written in clear, short and easy to follow and comprehensible form. Then comes the period of some of the greatest prose writers Saleh Mohammad, [[Ghulam Mohyuddin Afghan]], [[Zamarley]], [[Maulvi Mir Ahmed Shah]], and [[Abdul Rauf Qaney]] further contributed to the cause of Pashto prose in Afghanistan. To conclude, Pashto expressions far more exceeds prose collections in Pashto literature as prose needs special attention on the part of intellectuals and critics and as this very form of expression is less developed in prose vis-à-vis poetry.

===Pashto Academy===
{{Main|Pashto Academy}}
The Pashto Academy was established during the mid-1950s in [[Peshawar]], the capital city of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The founder of the academy was [[Maulana Abdul Qadir]] who since his student-life was very concerned about the future of [[Pashto language]]. He was a scholar in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[English language|English]], [[Urdu]] and Pashto. The establishment of the Academy helped give writers and intellectuals a platform, as well as helping the Pashto written word adopt a certain discipline. The academy publishes a quarterly magazine, ''[[Pashto (magazine)|Pashto]]'', providing an establishment of appreciation for the Pashto prose form.

Positive impact of the Pashto Academy on Pashto literature: The Pashto academy has played an important role in the development of Pashto language as the total number of books published after the establishment of the Pashto Academy are many-fold more than the number of books published in the past 1200 years of literary history of Pashto language. To conclude, we can say Pashto literature, especially, Pashto poetry is on its peak as the Pashto poets are not afraid to write [[Ghazal]], couplet or to do any kind of poetry, containing four, six or eight [[stanzas]]. The late historian, [[Khan Roshan khan]] from [[Swabi District]] along with Pashto Academy wrote the book,"[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tawarikh-i-hafiz-rahmat-khani-afghan-qabail-aur-un-ki-tarikh/oclc/037140470 Tawarikh-e-Hafiz Rehmat khani]".

==Pashto newspapers and magazines==
[[File:Mahmud Tarzi and his wife Asma Rasmiya.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mahmud Tarzi]], standing next to his wife, was one of Afghanistan's greatest [[intellectual]]s.&lt;ref name=MahmudTarzi&gt;[http://www.mahmudtarzi.com/MahmudTarzi/Biography.asp Biography of Mahmud Tarzi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006153801/http://www.mahmudtarzi.com/MahmudTarzi/Biography.asp |date=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known as the father of Afghan [[journalism]].]]

[[Syed Rahat Zakheili]] was not only a novelist and fiction writer of Pashto language, but Pashto first journalist who through journalism served the Pashto literature. To develop the Pashto literature, he started a weekly newspaper. ''[[Afghan (newspaper)|Afghan]]'' and appreciated the Pashto poets and writers through the weekly. Unlike other language newspapers, Pashto journalism started to develop the Pashto literature, so we can easily say that there was a strong link between Pashto literature and Pashto journalism and the journalism started as to help develop the Pashto literature. The editor of the weekly, ''Afgahn'' was [[Syed Abdullah Shah Kaka Khiel]]. Before Afghann Pashto journalism existed, but not in a regular and disciplined way. For instance, ''[[Al Jihad (newspaper)|Al Jihad]]'', one page newspaper owned by [[Abdul Ghaffar Peshawari]] used to be published under the editorship of Ghazi Abdul Ghafoor of Swat. Haji Sab Torakzai established a [[Litho]] press (printing press) in Tribal areas in 1915 during the ‘Jihad’ against Britain. Through this press special kind of pamphlets against the Britain used to publish and distributed among the people of the tribal areas. Similarly, ''[[Al Mujahid (newspaper)|Al Mujahid]]'' was another Pashto newspaper which started publishing in 1923 under the editorship of Maulvi Muhammad Bashir. This newspaper also used to publish in the tribal areas and printed material against the Britain. ''Zalmi Pashtoon'' was another daily newspaper which used to publish in 1933 and ''Hamdard Afghan'' published in 1929 under the editor ship of Khan Mir Hilali. During these days, Mohammad Nawaz Khatak started ''Watan'' that was a weekly newspaper.

''[[Wahdat]]'' and ''[[Khabroona]]'' are the two main dailies from Peshawar, Pakistan. ''Wahdat'' started its publication in the 1980s during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghan war]] for the purpose to create a link between Pashtoons living on the Pakistan-Afghan border. ''Daily Qudrat'' is the only Pashto daily published in Quetta, Pakistan. Weekly Newspaper ''BADLOON'' published from Mardan Editor Muhammad Zaman Adil.in Association of Writer Hands Media Group.
The editorial policy of the newspaper is free in a way that the paper is not under any kind of pressure from the government. Most of the material published in the editorial is Islamic. The newspaper mostly contains Islamic material. One page is a literature page comprising, editions related to religion (Islam). No such place has been given to sports or show biz news. ''Wahdat'' has no such magazine, etc., as supplement. ''Wahdat'' is mostly read in cities of [[Peshawar]], [[Mardan]], [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]], [[Karachi]] and [[Kandahar]]. ''Khabroona'' is another daily newspaper of Pashto language that started between 2001 and 2002. Khabroona is read in Peshawar, Mardan, Swat, suburbs of Peshawar and in Kabul, Afghanistan. Editorial policy of the newspaper is quite free and liberal as well vis-à-vis Wahdat. The newspaper is not under any governmental pressure. The content of the newspaper is quite different from Wahdat, as it gives enough space to sports and show-biz news. As for its ad policy, the newspaper publishes government and private sector ads. The head offices of both Wahdat and Khabroona are in Peshawar.

The regular publication of magazines in Pashto language started when the owner of the weekly Afghan, Rahat Zakheili, started the magazine, [[Stari Mashi]] in 1931. During those days ''Pashtoon magazine'' started under the editorship of Abdul Khaliq. And then some other people found the environment conducive for magazines reading and started the magazines like [[Selab]] and [[Angar (magazine)|Angar]] on regular bases. During the world war-II, a magazine, [[Nan Paroon]] was published from [[Delhi]] under the editorship of Maulana Abdul Qadir and barrister Nasrullah Khan. [[Khyber Magazine]], a magazine published from [[Government Islamia College]], Peshawar in the 1950s played a great role to project the views and problems of students on one hand and to promote Pashto literature on the other hand. Some other magazines which have their own fundamental and historical place in Pashto journalism are [[Qand]], [[Adal (magazine)|Adal]], [[Qandeel]] and [[Tamas (magazine)|Tamas]]. These magazines have ceased publication. Monthly magazine ''KARAHMAR'' published from Peshawar editor Muhammad Zaman Adil in Association of Writer Hands Media Group.

Noor-ul-bashaf Naveed publishes the magazine ''Likwal''. ''Pashtun'' is claimed by [[Awami National Party]]. One of the most popular Pashto magazines is ''Pasoon'', headed by Dr Israr. Watan and Mashal are the other two Pashto magazines

==Pashto radio==
[[File:Maidan radio host in 2009.jpg|thumb|A local radio personality for the ''Voice of Maiden'' in [[Wardak Province|Wardak province]] of Afghanistan.]]
[[Radio Kabul]] is the official radio station of Afghanistan. The first radio transmitters were installed in [[Kabul]] in the 1920s. King [[Amanullah Khan]] installed a 200 [[watt]] Russian transmitter operating at [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] 833 [[kHz]] at his Kabul Palace in 1925. The transmitter was replaced in 1931 by King [[Mohammed Nadir Khan|Nadir Khan]], and was upgraded during [[Muhammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]]'s reign in 1940 when a new 20 [[kilowatt]] transmitter was installed in its place, operating at 600&amp;nbsp;kHz.

In the meantime, ''Radio Pakistan, Peshawar'' started its programs in 1935. The first word broadcast from the station was ''Kalma-e-Tauheed''. Radio had great importance at the time because there were limited newspapers and no televisions, people listened to radio not only for news but for entertainment purposes as well. Radio has an important role in the lives of the Pashtun people. Since the literacy rate is low among them, every family has a radio set in their house. Even the women in rural areas are informed and entertained by radio.

Stations like FM Boraq and FM 101 are heard in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The private radio stations usually discuss the problems of youths, and as a result of which they listen to it and owing to this, these private stations get more funds as compared to the stations supervised by the government. Radio Pakistan in Peshawar played a huge role in the development of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Not only does it broadcast entertainment programs but also programs related to the development and welfare of the province. For instance, it broadcasts programs for women development, for health, education, for children, agriculture and so on. Pakistani FM radios which promots Pashto partially or fully:

Role of film in the development of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: From 1960 to 1980s Pashto film enjoyed its great times. Its standard was on no grounds less than that of Urdu films till mid-1970s and even 1980s. If there were waheed Murad, Nadim and Mohammad Ali in Lollywood (Urdu films), so Badar Munir, Asif Khan and many others were the chocolate heroes of

During these days cinema was the most effective way to communicate with the people as the standard of the movies were very good. Until the mid-1980s films were made on almost every subject and the people really loved to watch Pashto movies in cinema. So Pashto films played a great role in development of Pakhtoon khuwa as though cinema used to situate only in the urban areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but people from far flung areas came to cities such as Peshawar, Mardan, and Mingora to watch films. Now though the standard of the Pashto film has fallen very much, but the youths, especially the rural people still love to go to cinema.

Pashto films in the 1990s: until 1990 there were some great names in the Pashto film industry. For instance, Mir Hamza Shinwari who was a producer, director and a great name in the Pashto poetry. Murad Shinwari is the one whose name comes in the list of the producers and directors who really served the Pashto industry in its real sense. Amir Ghulam Sadiq is the only name in the Pashto film industry, who did poetry for Pashto films for almost more than 30 years. But after 1990 owing to the absence of institutionalization in the Pashto film industry, there were no such dedicated people, which in intern created environment conducive to vulgarity and obscenity and the standard of the Pashto films fell.

Many women enter prostitution for economic reasons. Some young Beninese women learn [[English language|English]] so they can go to Nigeria to work as prostitutes as Nigeria has a thriving sex industry.&lt;ref name="kroone" /&gt;

In rural areas widows will discretely turn to prostitution to support her family. This is a cultural and social tradition that is not regarded as prostitution by the community, but is regarded as a method of preserving the family name. Any children born from these liaisons take the dead husband's name. It's not uncommon for a widow to have five children after her husband has died.&lt;ref name="kroone" /&gt;

[[HIV]],&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt; [[sex trafficking]] and [[child sex tourism]] are problems in the country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

==Sexual health==
{{see also|HIV/AIDS in Benin}}
As with other [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries, HIV is a problem. Sex workers are amongst the high risk groups.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BÉHANZIN|first1=Luc|last2=DIABATÉ|first2=Souleymane|last3=MINANI|first3=Isaac|last4=BOILY|first4=Marie-Claude|last5=LABBÉ|first5=Annie-Claude|last6=AHOUSSINOU|first6=Clément|last7=ANAGONOU|first7=Séverin|last8=ZANNOU|first8=Djimon Marcel|last9=LOWNDES|first9=Catherine M|last10=ALARY|first10=Michel|title=Decline in the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections among female sex workers in Benin over 15 years of targeted interventions|pmc=3805545|journal=Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes |volume=63|issue=1|pages=126–134|doi=10.1097/QAI.0b013e318286b9d4|pmid=23337368|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clients are often soldiers and truck drivers. Because of their travelling, if they become infected, potentially they spread the infection over a wide area.&lt;ref name="kroone" /&gt;

In 1992, a prevention project, supported by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) was implemented among sex workers in the largest city, [[Cotonou]]. This saw [[condom]] use increase and HIV amongst sex workers fall from 53.3% in 1993 to 30.4% in 2008. The prevalence of other [[Sexually transmitted infections|STIs]] also fell significantly in the same period: [[gonorrhoea]] 43.2 to 6.4% and [[chlamydia]] 9.4 to 2.8%.&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;

The [[NGO]], Centre d'Etudes, de Recherches et d'Interventions pour le Développement (CERID), provides sex workers with free medical treatment and counselling.&lt;ref name="kroone" /&gt; UNAIDS reported in 2016 that the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers in the country was 15.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV prevalence amongst sex workers |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d9c0ff12-f62c-44e7-8e2c-dbe736bbea30 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Benin}}
Benin is a source, transit, and destination country for women, children subjected to sex trafficking. Most identified victims are Beninese girls subjected to sex trafficking in Cotonou and across Benin’s southern corridor. Togolese girls are exploited in [[commercial sex]] in Benin. Cases of child sex tourism involving both boys and girls along the coast and within the [[Mono Department|department of Mono]] have been reported in previous years. A 2016 survey conducted in the cities of Cotonou in southern Benin and [[Malanville]] in northern Benin indicated that girls are subjected to [[sexual exploitation]], including potential sex trafficking, in these two cities. The [[Ouémé Department|department of Oueme]] in southeast Benin was reportedly a primary area of recruitment for [[child trafficking]] victims subsequently exploited in the [[Republic of the Congo]]. Most child victims intercepted in Benin, either from Benin or other [[West Africa]]n countries, are exploited or en route to exploitation within the country. Benin is the largest source country for trafficking victims in the Republic of the Congo; Beninese victims are also subjected to trafficking in Nigeria, [[Gabon]], and [[Lebanon]]. West African women are exploited in commercial sex in Benin. Young Beninese women are recruited from Benin by unlicensed Beninese and Lebanese recruiters for domestic work in Lebanon and [[Kuwait]]; reportedly, some are forced into commercial sex. OCPM reports that traffickers no longer travel with child victims being moved internally or to nearby countries. Victims now travel alone and are met by traffickers or their accomplices once they reach their destination. This tactic makes investigations more difficult.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benin 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271147.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=27 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing laws do not prohibit all forms of trafficking. The 2006 Act Relating to the Transportation of Minors and the Suppression of Child Trafficking (act 2006-04) criminalizes child trafficking but focuses on movement of children rather than their ultimate exploitation and prescribes penalties of six months to two years imprisonment or fines if children are moved for the purpose of labor exploitation; these penalties are not sufficiently stringent. The penal code outlaws procuring or offering a person for prostitution and the facilitation of prostitution with punishments of six months to two years imprisonment. None of these punishments are sufficiently stringent or commensurate with punishments prescribed for other serious crimes. Comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation that would criminalize all forms of trafficking, including the trafficking of adults, has been pending MOJ review since September 2012.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Benin as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Benin 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282614.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professor Rasul Amin''' ({{lang-ps| رسول امين }}) was a renowned Afghan politician, Lexicographer social figure, writer and former education minister.

==Early life and=Academic life==

Professor Rasul Amin was born on May 10, 1939 in a cultural diversity area, [[Wata Pur District]] of eastern [[Kunar Province]] through which Alexandar The Great, Hindus, and all of other conquers passed through this beautiful valley of [[Afghanistan]]. Rasul Amin was son of a prominent khan of the Amin tribe. His mother, Hera Amin cultural background was Greece (Nooristan). He was a great nephew of Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan. He was raised as an orphan, because his mother died when he was 5 years old. His personality was self made, and that made him positive throughout his life. His father, Amin Khan  participated in the uprising with the leading attorney general, Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan in 1947. Due to the bad government he was forced to depart with Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan to Herat and Mazar-e Sharif. Rasul completed his primary education in Kunar.&lt;ref name="larawbar"&gt;http://larawbar.com/details.php?id=13974&amp;date=2009-10-31&amp;author={{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, he went to [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]] where he wanted to desire further more studies and gather his [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu]] languages. Overall he knew how to speak 4 languages, including Pushto and Dari. After learning the two languages, he got an admission at Forward College, and graduated in 1960. In 1960, he was admitted to [[Islamia College University|Islamia College]] Peshawar, Pakistan. He was elected as a General-Secretary of the Khyber Union, (students’ union), in 1962, a unique, unprecedented honour for an Afghan student. In 1963, he was voted the best debater at college. He received a BA in 1964 and a double master's degree in Sociology, English and Political Science in 1966.&lt;ref name="pan"&gt;http://individual.com/story.php?story=109398911&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet resistance==
From 1980 to 1985 he worked with the [[National Islamic Front (Afghanistan)|National Islamic Front]] of [[Pir Sayed Ahmad Gillani]] in Peshawar. 1990s, he worked with the Rome Group that was established by the former King, Muhammad Zaher Shah. He initially worked with the renowned Afghan intellectual Professor Seyyed Bahauddin Majrooh at the Afghanistan Information Centre (AIC). The AIC became a respected mouthpiece of liberal Afghan intellectuals linked to the resistance but drew the wrath of the fundamentalist factions. Prof. Majrooh was assassinated in Peshawar in 1988 after the AIC had published the results of a poll among Afghan refugees that showed that the former King was the most popular Afghan politician, way ahead of the mujahedin leaders.  On 21 March 1985, Rasul established the Organization Writers Union of Free Afghanistan, which, as the AIC, was supported by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (Germany), USIS, the Asia Foundation (USA), and the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Denmark). Like the AIC, it became a renowned institution that – amongst other activities – collected documents on the Afghan resistance, one of the few to do so. He was one of the great politicians and a well known scholar of Afghanistan. He dedicated his entire life for helping his Afghanistan milat and had dream of seeing a united afghan people.  Professor had written tens of books and magazines about literature, culture and sociology. He was the first author of English, Pashto and Dari language, in Asia, Africa around the world.

==Civil war==
In 1990 Rasul Amin warned that 'If the United States cuts or reduces its aid to the Afghan cause, it will be replaced by the Arabs. Afghanistan would not be at peace for a long time.' Amin's prediction came true when in the 90s the US and the Soviet left a power vacuum and a civil war broke out where the warring factions were all supported by one of Afghans neighbour countries. Rasul Amin, one of the most notable Afghan Scholars, at that time always kept an automatic rifle behind his chair and a pistol on his desk.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Crosette|first=Barbara|title=As Accord on Afghan Future Nears, Refugees Live in Fear and Hardship|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/19/world/as-accord-on-afghan-future-nears-refugees-live-in-fear-and-hardship.html?src=pm|accessdate=3 May 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 19, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 he said about that [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan Civil War]] "This is not truly an Afghan fight. Only a few people who want power sell themselves to foreigners."&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradlee|first=Ben|title=a nation dissolves into tribal war Taliban, once seen as saviors, now the latest scourge to fall on embattled land|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/16304730.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+03%2C+1996&amp;author=Ben+Bradlee+Jr.%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=a+nation+dissolves+into+tribal+war+Taliban%2C+once+seen+as+saviors%2C+now+the+latest+scourge+to+fall+on+embattled+land&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=11 May 2011|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=Nov 3, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Taliban Afghanistan==
Rasul also played an important role in Rome Conference held in 2001 under the supervision of former king [[Mohammad Zahir Shah]]. After the fall of the Taliban regime, Prof. Amin returned to Afghanistan. At the Bonn conference, he was appointed Minister of Education in the Interim Administration of Afghanistan, representing the Rome Group. When the new school year was opened in March 2002, he said: We have decided to project a new image of ourselves. We have to forget the past if we want to rebuild this country.’During his ministry he visited Japan and met with Emperor of Japan.

Professor Rasul Amin organized peace conference, seminars and workshops for Afghanistan. The most famous seminar was in Pearl Continental, Peshawar, Pakistan during 1991, whose chief guest and chair person was Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto. A lot of other scholars and prominent figures was invited on this Peace conference . Professor was very popular and famous in a group of friends. Louis Dupree and his wife, Nancy Hatch Dupree and Christina Eckerly was very close friends of him.

In 2001, Rasul Amin became the first Education Minister of Afghanistan. He stated that Afghan girls be given priority in their education and said, "there was a big task to rebuild his homeland (Afghanistan) education system after 24 years of unrest". That was his "to do" list in his early days as Afghanistan education minister. He was so committed to fulfill his duties. He was posted in 2002 and he resigned. He decided to devote himself fully to the intellectual regeneration of Afghanistan and to Afghan-Pak friendship. The 2004 article ‘Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question’ is only one in a long list of his writings.

Prof. Amin established the Afghanistan Study Centre (ASC) in Kabul as the successor of WUFA. The founder also became its director and the editor of the Journal of Afghanistan Studies quarterly. He served as the [[Minister of Education (Afghanistan)|Minister of Education]] in the interim Transitional Administration under President [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref name="pan"/&gt; While being a Minister of Education, he looked after oprhan homes, schools etc.  He really wanted that woman of Afghanistan should be educated.

The eldest is Shamim Amin Akbar, followed by Yasmin Amin Safi, Eimal Amin, the middle child, Tatara Amin Zamani,  Pukhtana Amin Habib Atal Amin and the youngest, Kochie Amin. Professor Rasul Amin treated his all children equally but his middle child Pushtana Amin habib was his favourite from them all  because she was a angel and wasn't afraid of anything.  She was also  his favourite child because she is brave and courages girl like her  father.

'''Samaná English''' (SE and SAX) is a variety of the [[English language]] spoken by descendants of black immigrants from the [[United States]] who have lived in the [[Samaná Peninsula]], now in the [[Dominican Republic]]. Members of the enclave are known as the [[Samaná Americans]].

The language is a relative of the [[African-American Vernacular English]], with variations unique to the enclave's history in the area. In the 1950 Dominican Republic census, 0.57% of the population (about 12,200 people) said that their [[mother tongue]] was English.&lt;ref name=ONE_HistoriaMetodologia&gt;{{cite web |title=Historia, Metodología y Organización de los Censos en República Dominicana: 1920–1993 |url=http://inabima.gob.do/descargas/biblioteca/Autores%20Dominicanos/Irma%20Nicasio%20y%20Jes%FAs%20de%20la%20Rosa/Irma%20Nicasio%20y%20Jes%FAs%20de%20la%20Rosa%20-%20Historia,%20metodolog%EDa%20y%20organizaci%F3n%20de%20censos%20en%20Rep.%20Dom..PDF |publisher=Oficinal Nacional de Estadística |accessdate=14 May 2014 |author=Irma Nicasio |author2=Jesús de la Rosa|location=Santo Domingo |page=44/131 |language=Spanish |date=April 1998}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration==
Most speakers trace their lineage to immigrants that arrived to the Peninsula in 1824 and 1825. All of [[Unification of Hispaniola|Hispaniola]] was all administered by [[Haiti]], and its president was [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]]. The immigrants responded to an invitation for settlement that [[Jonathas Granville]] had delivered in person to [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], and [[New York City]]. [[Abolitionists]] like [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]], [[Samuel Cornish]], [[Benjamin Lundy]], and [[Loring D. Dewey]] joined the campaign, which was coined the [[Haitian emigration]].

The response was unprecedented, as thousands of [[African Americans]] boarded ships in eastern cities and migrated to Haiti. Most of the immigrants arrived during the fall of 1824 and the spring of 1825. More continued moving back and forth in later years but at a slower rate.

Between 1859 and 1863, another immigration campaign brought new settlers to the island but at a fraction of the number in 1824 and 1825. Those who originally settled in Samana were fewer than 600 but formed the only surviving immigration enclave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=From North America to Hispaniola | publisher=Central Michigan University | author=Hidalgo, Dennis R. | year=2003 | location=Mt. Pleasant, Michigan | pages=1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1218418 | title=The search for a black nationality : black emigration and colonization, 1787–1863 | publisher=University of Illinois | author=Miller, Floyd J. | year=1975 | location=Urbana | pages=132–250 | isbn=0252002636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survival==
While more than 6000 immigrants came in 1824 and 1835, by the end of the 19th century, only a handful of enclaves on the island spoke any variety of the antebellum Black Vernacular. They were communities in [[Puerto Plata (city)|Puerto Plata]], Samaná and [[Santo Domingo]]. The largest was the one in Samaná that maintained church schools, where it was preserved. During the [[Rafael Trujillo]] dictatorship (1930–1961), however, the government began a systematic policy of [[Hispanicization|Hispanizing]] the entire Dominican population. The church schools in which English was taught were eliminated, and the language was discouraged.

Enclaves across the island soon lost an important element of their identity, which led to their disintegration. Samaná English withstood the assaults in pa because the location of Samaná was favorable to a more independent cultural life. However, government policies have still influenced the language's gradual decline, which may well now be an [[endangered language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33327596 | title=A Matter of Time: Past Temporal Reference Verbal Structures in Samaná English and the Ex-Slave Recordings | publisher=Université d'Ottawa | author=Tabliamonte, Sali Anna. . | year=1991 | location=Ottawa, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://elanguage.net/journals/bls/article/viewFile/2312/2274 | title=A Dialect That Time Forgot | author=DeBose, Charles E. | journal=Proceedings of the Ninth Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society | year=1983 | pages=47–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.bagn.academiahistoria.org.do/boletines/boletin119/BAGN_2007_No_119-05.pdf | title=Asentamiento y vida económica de los inmigrantes afroamericanos de Samaná: testimonio de la profesora Martha Willmore (Leticia) | author=[[Martha Ellen Davis (ethnomusicologist)|Davis, Martha Ellen]] | journal=Boletín del Archivo General de la Nación | year=2007 | edition=LXIX, Vol. XXXII, Núm. 119 | volume=32 | issue=119 | pages=709–734 | access-date=2014-06-15 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714120545/http://www.bagn.academiahistoria.org.do/boletines/boletin119/BAGN_2007_No_119-05.pdf | archive-date=2014-07-14 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
The language is variously described as either a [[creole language]] or a [[dialect]] of English. It is similar to that of [[English-based creole languages|Caribbean English Creoles]] spoken by the English-speaking Caribbean, especially [[Turks and Caicos Islands Creole|Turks and Caicos]] and [[Bahamian Creole]].

==Ethnologue==
The 15th edition (2005) of [[Ethnologue]] dropped it from its list of languages, but linguists still consider it a separate language variation.

'''Social organization in Cambodia''' is very [[hierarchical]]. The greater a person's age, the greater the level of respect that must be granted to them. Everyone in Khmer culture is given a hierarchical title before the name - in some cases names are shortened with the title added before the name is given - which varies in relation to the person. In some cases elders are referred to by a family title even though there is no relation, out of respect to their seniority in life. Referring to someone by the improper title is a sign of disrespect and would be assumed as improper parenting or a lack of respect for elders.

==Description==
In the late 1980s, the nuclear family, consisting of a husband and a wife and their unmarried children, probably continued to be the most important kin group within Khmer society. The family is the major unit of both production and consumption. Within this unit are the strongest emotional ties, the assurance of aid in the event of trouble, economic cooperation in labor, sharing of produce and income, and contribution as a unit to ceremonial obligations. A larger grouping, the personal kindred that includes a nuclear family with the children, grandchildren, grandparents, uncles, aunts, first cousins, nephews, and nieces, may be included in the household. Family organization is weak, and ties between related families beyond the kindred are loosely defined at best. There is no tradition of family names, although the French tried to legislate their use in the early twentieth century. Most Khmer genealogies extend back only two or three generations, which contrasts with the veneration of ancestors by the Vietnamese and by the Chinese. Noble families and royal families, some of which can trace their descent for several generations, are exceptions.&lt;ref name=household&gt;[[Federal Research Division]]. Russell R. Ross, ed. "Household and Family Structure". [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/khtoc.html ''Cambodia: A Country Study.''] Research completed December 1987. ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual Khmer is surrounded by a small inner circle of family and friends who constitute his or her closest associates, those he would approach first for help. In rural communities, neighbors—who are often also kin—may be important, too, and much of housebuilding and other heavy labor-intensive tasks are performed by groups of neighbors. Beyond this close circle are more distant relatives and casual friends. In rural Cambodia, the strongest ties a Khmer may develop—besides those to the nuclear family and to close friends—are those to other members of the local community. A strong feeling of pride—for the village, for the district, and province—usually characterizes Cambodian community life. There is much sharing of religious life through the local Buddhist temple, and there are many cross-cutting kin relations within the community. Formerly, the Buddhist priesthood, the national armed forces, and, to a lesser extent, the civil service all served to connect the Khmer to the wider national community. The priesthood served only males, however, while membership in some components of the armed forces and in the civil service was open to women as well.&lt;ref name=household/&gt;

Two fictive relationships in Cambodia transcend kinship boundaries and serve to strengthen interpersonal and interfamily ties. A Khmer may establish a fictive child-parent or sibling relationship called thoa (roughly translating as adoptive parent or sibling). The person desiring to establish the thoa relationship will ask the other person for permission to enter into the relationship. The thoa relationship may become as close as the participants desire. The second fictive relationship is that of kloeu (close male friend). This is similar, in many ways, to becoming a blood brother. A person from one place may ask a go-between in another place to help him establish a kloeu relationship with someone in that place. Once the participants agree, a ceremony is held that includes ritual drinking of water into which small amounts of the participants' blood have been mixed and bullets and knives have been dipped; prayers are also recited by an achar (or ceremonial leader) before witnesses. The kloeu relationship is much stronger than the thoa. One kloeu will use the same kinship terms when addressing his kloeu's parents and siblings as he would when addressing his own. The two friends can call upon each other for any kind of help at any time. The kloeu relationship apparently is limited to some rural parts of Cambodia and to Khmer-speaking areas in Thailand. As of the late 1980s, it may have become obsolete. The female equivalent of kloeu is mreak.&lt;ref name=household/&gt;

Legally, the husband is the head of the Khmer family, but the wife has considerable authority, especially in family economics. The husband is responsible for providing shelter and food for his family; the wife is generally in charge of the family budget, and she serves as the major ethical and religious model for the children, especially the daughters. In rural areas, the male is mainly responsible for such activities as plowing and harrowing the rice paddies, threshing rice, collecting sugar palm juice, caring for cattle, carpentry, and buying and selling cows and chickens. Women are mainly responsible for pulling and transplanting rice seedlings, harvesting and winnowing rice, tending gardens, making sugar, weaving, and caring for the household money. Both males and females may work at preparing the rice paddies for planting, tending the paddies, and buying and selling land.&lt;ref name=household/&gt;

Ownership of property among the rural Khmer was vested in the nuclear family. Descent and inheritance is bilateral. Legal children might inherit equally from their parents. The division of property was theoretically equal among siblings, but in practice the oldest child might inherit more. Each of the spouses might bring inherited land into the family, and the family might acquire joint land during the married life of the couple. Each spouse was free to dispose of his or her land as he or she chose. A will was usually oral, although a written one was preferred.&lt;ref name=household/&gt;

As the married couple moves through life they have children, nurture and train them, educate them, and marry them off. When they become too old to support themselves, they may invite the youngest child's family to move in and to take over running the household. At this stage in their lives, they enjoy a position of high status, they help care for grandchildren, and they devote more time in service to the wat (temple).&lt;ref name=families&gt;[[Federal Research Division]].

The '''Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI)''', first published in spring 2009 and updated in 2011, analyze and compare the need for reform in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) member countries, as well as each country's ability to respond to current social and political challenges. The project is designed to create a comprehensive data pool on [[government]]-related activities in the countries considered the world's most developed [[Market economy|free-market]] [[democracies]]. In addition, it uses international comparisons to provide evidence-based input for reform-related public discourse taking place in these countries. The SGI are updated every two or three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgi-network.org/index.php?page=faq&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behind the project ==
The [[Bertelsmann Foundation]] is an operational think tank that encourages social change and aims to foster sustainability by identifying nascent challenges early on and by developing strategies to face these issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/cps/rde/xchg/SID-EBDD7A2B-365804A0/bst_engl/hs.xsl/2085.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
Three scholars with established country expertise are involved in the analysis of each OECD state under review. In an attempt to identify and reduce subjective bias, the SGI project selects experts representing both domestic and external views as well as the viewpoints of political scientists and economists. Comparative political scientists with area expertise then integrate the two expert reports into a single country report, and select information according to certain validity and objectivity criteria.

== SGI and the Transformation Index ==
The SGI concept is inspired by the [[Bertelsmann Foundation]]’s Transformation Index (BTI).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bertelsmann-transformation-index.de/&lt;/ref&gt; The Transformation Index focuses on 128 countries—all of which are transitioning to a market-based democracy or potentially headed in that direction—and assesses the extent to which political management fulfils criteria regarding [[sustainability]], democracy founded on the rule of law, [[social integration]] and [[welfare]]. Since 2002, the BTI has been documenting the progress 128 transformation countries have been making toward democracy and a market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Empter, Stefan &amp; Josef Janning (2009): Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009 - An Introduction, in: Bertelsmann Stiftung (ed.): Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009. Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD. Gütersloh: Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2009. p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;
Using a similar approach to BTI, the SGI evaluate the extent to which OECD member states are in a position, given changing domestic and international conditions, to implement the reforms necessary for ensuring their future viability. By measuring the need for reform along with the effectiveness of existing initiatives, the SGI aims to identify the best policy solutions for promoting democracy and a market economy.

== Infrastructure of the SGI ==
The need for reform within a country is analyzed in the Sustainable Governance Indicators in the Status Index, while the capacity for reform is analyzed in the Management Index.

=== Status Index ===
[[File:SGI Status Index.JPG|thumb|500px|right|Construction of the SGI Status Index]]

Status Index scores are composite measures, based on numerous [[Numerical data|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] assessments. The democracy category counts for half of the index score, while the four policy-specific categories collectively provide the remainder.

The Status Index analyzes the need for reform through two principle dimensions: 
* The first dimension of the Status Index maps the quality of democracy within a country and examines four criteria: "[[Election|Electoral Process]]," "Access to Information," "[[Civil Rights]]," and "[[Rule of Law]]."
* The second dimension of the Status Index corresponds to the OECD states' competencies in policy fields that are highly relevant for future viability. The index examines fields such as "[[Economy]] and [[Employment]]," "[[Social work|Social Affairs]]," "[[Security]]," and "[[Resources]]," which include 15 different policy areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgi-network.org/index.php?page=index&amp;index=status&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Management Index ===
[[File:SGI Management Index.JPG|thumb|500px|right|Construction of the SGI Management Index]]

Management Index scores are composite measures, based on numerous quantitative and qualitative assessments. The three categories "Steering Capability," "Policy [[Implementation]]" and "Institutional Learning" collectively count for half of the index score, while the Executive Accountability dimension provides the remaining half. The Management Index considers, in relative terms, how capable governments and societies are of effective reform.

The Management Index examines government performance and analyzes a country's reform capacity through two dimensions: 
* The first dimension, Executive Capacity, measures the strategic steering and problem solving capabilities of the respective OECD states. Thus, Executive Capacity analyzes a government's organizational structures and processes. The main analytical categories used were "Steering Capability," "Policy Implementation" and "Institutional Learning."  
* The second dimension, Executive Accountability, looks at how the government interacts with external state and non-state actors ([[Citizenship|Citizens]], [[parliament]]s, [[political parties]], [[trade association]]s and [[News media|media]]) and measures to what extent these actors positively influence the executive branch.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009. Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==

===Status Index 2011===
[[File:SGI Status Index map.JPG|thumb|500px|right|Status Index results 2011; results displayed on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) {{legend|#d0e1eb|Score &lt; 4}} {{legend|#89adc5|Score &gt; 4}}  {{legend|#77a4bb|Score &gt; 5}}  {{legend|#5f92af|Score &gt; 6}}  {{legend|#5b7a8e|Score &gt; 7}}  {{legend|#4a5b63|Score &gt; 8}}]]

The top rankings of the Status Index are dominated by [[Nordic countries|northern European]] countries. At the same time, the leading group also includes New Zealand, with its Anglo-Saxon heritage, and continental European Switzerland, two nations with different political and state welfare traditions.

The group of mid-range scorers (Canada, Australia, Germany, [[Iceland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], United States, Ireland, United Kingdom, Belgium, Austria, [[Czech Republic]], France, [[Portugal]], Japan, [[Chile]], Spain, and [[Poland]]) and the lowest-ranking group ([[South Korea]], Italy, [[Slovakia]], Mexico, [[Greece]], and [[Turkey]]) are geographically and culturally just as heterogeneous as the top group.
Standard typologies in [[Comparative politics|comparative political science]] are insufficient to explain the Status Index ranking of the OECD nations. For example, majoritarian democracies do not systematically score better or worse than consensus democracies. Classifying the countries as [[Federalism|federalist]] and [[Centralized government|centralist]] states also fails to help explain the differences in reform capacity.
The top group includes, above all, [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[welfare states]] such as the [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]]. However, [[Liberalism|liberal]] welfare states also achieve high scores, with New Zealand, Switzerland and Canada in the upper mid-range. In general, the findings of the Status Index reveal higher scores among long-term, established OECD members – although there are exceptions: Chile, a new member, places in the lower midrange, while Italy and Greece rank significantly lower than some [[East-Central Europe|Eastern European]] countries. This suggests that the smaller, more open national economies tend to pursue especially sustainable policies.

===Management Index 2011===
[[File:SGI Management Index map.JPG|thumb|500px|right|Management Index results 2011; results displayed on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) {{legend|#e3e9c4|Score &lt; 4 }} {{legend|#cfda9c|Score &gt; 4}} {{legend|#bccb74|Score &gt; 5}}  {{legend|#9eb73e|Score &gt; 6}}  {{legend|#8d9c55|Score &gt; 7}}  {{legend|#77805a|Score &gt; 8}}]]

At the highest level of aggregation in the Management Index, the overview provides important initial indications of which countries exhibit the best performance of governance overall and which countries show deficiencies. Background information in greater depth on the performance of a given country can be found in the country reports on the SGI website.&lt;ref&gt;http://sgi-network.org/&lt;/ref&gt; These include substantiated, qualitative information right down to the level of individual indicators.

The SGI Management Indicators are clearly led by Sweden and Norway, each with average scores exceeded 8 points. Next come Denmark, Finland, New Zealand and Australia. While the overall ranking of northern European countries is again outstanding, as observed in the Status Index, this sequence also underscores the fact that no particular system type is favored in the Management Index. This top group is followed by a broad mid-range in which the changes in index scores are incremental, leaving no discernible clusters. Clearly bringing up the rear of the survey are Greece and Slovakia. Both countries trail Italy, which is 29th in the ranking, by nearly an entire point. The new OECD member Chile stands out positively, already scoring higher than some established, longstanding OECD states.

=== Summary of results ===
The central finding of the SGI is that the quality of governance is most important in ensuring sustainable policy outcomes. Countries with "good executive management performance, a sound democratic order and an effective inclusion of societal actors into policymaking processes are more successful in terms of sustainability and also in terms of social justice." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgi-network.org/index.php?page=news&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yanesha'''' or '''Amuesha''' people are an [[ethnic group]] of the [[Peruvian Amazon rainforest]]. Presently, the most recent [[Census|census count]] puts their [[population]] at over 7,000 distributed among 48 communities located in [[Puerto Inca Province]] ([[Huánuco Region|Huánuco]]), [[Chanchamayo Province]] ([[Junín Region|Junín]]) and [[Oxapampa Province]] ([[Pasco Region|Pasco]]). They are a relatively small group, making up barely 2.91% of [[Indigenous Peoples in Peru|indigenous]] inhabitants located in the Peruvian Amazon. Their communities are situated in altitudes ranging from 200 to 1600 meters above [[sea level]] and can also be found along the shores of various [[river]]s including the [[Pichis River|Pichis]], [[Palcazu River|Palcazu]], [[Pachitea River|Pachitea]], [[Huancabamba River|Huancabamba]], [[Cacazú River|Cacazú]], [[Chorobamba River|Chorobamba]], and the [[Yurinaqui River]]s.

==Name==
The Yanesha' are also known as Amage, Amagues, Amaje, Amajo, Amoishe, Amueixa, Amuese, Amuesha, Amuetamo, Lorenzo, and Omage.&lt;ref name=ethno&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ame "Yanesha."] ''Ethnologue.'' Retrieved 4 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Yanesha people speak [[Yanesha' language|Yanesha']], a language belonging to the [[Maipurean]] [[language family]],&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt; that also includes [[Asháninka language|Asháninka]], [[Yine language|Yine]], and others. A dictionary and grammar have been published in Yanesha', which is written in the [[Latin script]].&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

== History ==
The tribe's first contact with non-native people came through [[friar]]s who, in the second half of the 16th century, made an incursion into the region.  However, it was not until the 18th century that missionaries (this time [[Franciscan]]s) managed to establish steady relations with the Yanesha’ and other ethnic groups living nearby.  Father Francisco de San José founded various missions around [[Cerro de la Sal]] and [[Quimiri]] in order to convert the indigenous populations to [[Christianity]].  However, in 1742, indigenous people commanded by [[Juan Santos Atahualpa]] rebelled against the Spaniards and destroyed a number of missions, effectively cutting off outside contact for several decades.

It’s not known for sure the population of the Yanesha' people at this time but they had certainly already begun to die off from European diseases.  During the 19th century, the area inhabited by the Yanesha’ and other groups was reexplored by expeditions looking to establish routes to the lower Amazon and to [[colonization|colonize]] the area.

The arrival of westerners represented for the Yanesha' the loss of land and a dramatic change of living customs ensued; they were grouped into towns and their extensive territories became the property of colonists.  With this situation, they were compelled to group together and became the first ethnic group to form a professional organization: the Amuesha Congress.  This later became the Yanesha' Federation. The Law of Indigenous Communities ([[Spanish language|sp]]: ''La Ley de Comunidades Indígenas''), promulgated in 1974, partly repaired the situation of dispossession by granting some land to Yanesha' groups.

The Yanesha' people once lived through [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and [[subsistence agriculture]]; in modern times, the emphasis is on [[agricultural diversification]] and cultivation of [[cash crop]]s like [[coffee]] and [[annatto]].  Hunting became much rarer after the Yanesha' people began raising animals for consumption.  In addition, groups have begun exploiting [[Uncaria tomentosa|Cat’s claw]].  The marketing of ceramic [[craft]]s has also become a source of income.

In 1988, a territory of over 34,774 [[hectare]]s was set up in [[Palcazu District]] as the [[Yanesha Communal Reservation|Yanesha' Communal Reservation]] (''Reserva Communal Yanesha''') with the purpose of protecting important [[fauna]] that serves as sustenance to Yanesha' communities in the area.
