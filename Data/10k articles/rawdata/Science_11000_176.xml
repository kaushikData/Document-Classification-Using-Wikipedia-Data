"'''21st Century (Digital Boy)'''" is a song by the [[punk rock]] group [[Bad Religion]]. It was originally recorded in 1990 on their fifth full-length studio album ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]'' and re-recorded on the 1994 album ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]''. The following year it was included on the ''[[All Ages]]'' compilation release.

Although the ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]'' version was not released as a single, the ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]'' version was a popular hit. The hit version was also featured on the 2002 compilation ''[[Punk Rock Songs]]'', which was not endorsed by the band.

==Re-recording==
In 1994, Bad Religion re-recorded the song for their eighth studio album ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]''. Guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] claimed that Bad Religion re-recorded it because their then-label [[Atlantic Records]] said they did not "hear a single" in that album and thought the song was a hit so they asked the band to redo it.

When also asked why "21st Century (Digital Boy)" would be re-recorded for ''Stranger Than Fiction'', bassist [[Jay Bentley]] replied:

:[We re-released the song] because we were playing it every night since 1989, '90. It wasn't that we weren't happy with it. I was thrilled with it. I thought it was a great fucking song. Brett just happened to think that we were playing it better than we played it on the record. He just thought it was the one song of his that had a snowball's chance in hell of being popular. I think one of Brett's quests as a song writer was to write a pop hit. That's hard to do when you're in a punk rock band. He always thought that song could be a pop hit, and he fought for it to get on the record and to be a single. I eventually got tired of saying 'that's not what we do'. That's what he wanted to do when he was a member of the band at the time and we all went 'well, OK, if you feel that strongly about it, we'll put it on the record'. We have a very democratic process which is that if 3 members vote one way, then it's going to happen, unless one member feels so strongly about it, then we all just concede and say that's cool.

==Meaning and composition==
The lyrics of the song could be interpreted as a rejection of modern [[consumerism|consumerist]] culture, as exemplified in the lyrics ''"I'm a 21st Century Digital Boy / I don't know how to live, but I've got a lot of toys"''. This alienation and rejection of consumerism and mainstream culture is a common theme in the music of Bad Religion. The bridge includes references to the group's two previous records (as of the original recording), ''[[Suffer (album)|Suffer]]'' and ''[[No Control (Bad Religion album)|No Control]]''. Contrary to rumor, "21st Century (Digital Boy)" was not written or performed live in 1988 nor was it going to appear on ''No Control''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=21st_century_(digital_boy) |title=21st Century (Digital Boy) &amp;#124; The Answer &amp;#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song pays homage to [[King Crimson]]'s "[[21st Century Schizoid Man]]", even incorporating some of its lyrics towards the end:

''Cat's foot iron claw''&lt;br&gt;
''Neuro-surgeons scream for more''&lt;br&gt;
''Innocents raped with napalm fire''

The line "''everything I want I really need''" that follows is a play on "[[21st Century Schizoid Man]]"'s "''nothing he's got he really needs.''" The principal difference between the two versions is after that line. On original Against the Grain, as the song fades out, Graffin sings the title of the song four more times with a different word instead of "digital" (including "''21st Century Schizoid Boy''" in reference to King Crimson's song) backed with another guitar solo. Stranger Than Fiction version ends with one final "Ain't life a mystery?" line.

Excerpt from a 2010 interview with Greg Graffin in Scientific American magazine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=darwin-was-a-punk-question-and-answer-with-greg-graffin-bad-religion|title=Was Darwin a Punk? A Q&amp;A with Punker-Paleontologist Greg Graffin|first=David|last=Biello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Q: "Your most famous song is "21st Century Digital Boy," which pokes fun at our gadget-laden era."

A: "Oh no, we love technology and gadgets. We use irony in 60 percent of our music. "21st Century Digital Boy" is an ironic twist characterizing the youth of today. The truth is that even though the song was written in 1990, it was clear that the youth were going to be affected for good and bad by digital technology. It's probably because we loved video games so much."

==In modern culture==
The ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]'' version is available as downloadable content in both ''[[Rock Band 2]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]''. ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' incorrectly notes 2004 instead of 1990 as its date of the song. The 2004 date could possibly be referring to ''Against the Grain'''s remastered date.

''[[The Dylan Ratigan Show]]'', a television program on the news channel [[MSNBC]], used the song as background music during a segment targeting "Facebook addiction".

==Cover versions==
* The song was covered in 2006 as "[[21st Century Digital Girl]]" by German [[trance (music)|trance]]/dance group [[Groove Coverage]].
* The band Radio Cult released a cover of the song on their album "Grooves from the Grave" in 2008.
* The song also appears on the 1994 live album Hel! by [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[Trallpunk]] band [[Charta 77 (band)|Charta 77]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3624">'''Aces II''' ('''A'''dvanced '''C'''oncepts in '''E'''lectronic '''S'''tructure Theory) is an [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] [[computational chemistry]] package for performing high-level quantum chemical ab initio calculations. Its major strength is the accurate calculation of atomic and molecular energies as well as properties using many-body techniques such as many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and, in particular [[coupled cluster]] techniques to treat electron correlation. The development of ACES II began in early 1990 in the group of Professor [[Rodney J. Bartlett]] at the Quantum Theory Project (QTP) of the [[University of Florida]] in Gainesville. There, the need for more efficient codes had been realized and the idea of writing an entirely new program package emerged. During 1990 and 1991 John F. Stanton, [[Jürgen Gauß]], and John D. Watts, all of them at that time postdoctoral researchers in the Bartlett group, supported by a few students, wrote the backbone of what is now known as the ACES II program package. The only parts which were not new coding efforts were the integral packages (the MOLECULE package of J. Almlöf, the VPROP package of P.R. Taylor, and the integral derivative package ABACUS of T. Helgaker, P. Jorgensen J. Olsen, and H.J. Aa. Jensen).   The latter was modified extensively for adaptation with Aces II, while the others remained very much in their original forms.

Ultimately, two different versions of the program evolved.   The first was maintained by the Bartlett group at the University of Florida, and the other (known as ACESII-MAB) was maintained by groups at the University of Texas, Universitaet Mainz in Germany, and ELTE in Budapest, Hungary.   The latter has recently been renamed as CFOUR.

'''Aces III''' is a parallel implementation that was released in the fall of 2008.  The effort led to definition of a new architecture for scalable parallel software called the super instruction architecture. The design and creation of software is divided into two parts:

# The algorithms are coded in a domain specific language called super instruction assembly language or SIAL, pronounced "sail" for easy communication.
# The SIAL programs are executed by a MPMD parallel virtual machine called the super instruction processor or SIP.

The ACES III program consists of 580,000 lines of SIAL code of which 200,000 lines are comments, and 230,000 lines of C/C++ and Fortran of which 62,000 lines are comments.

'''ANVUR''' ('''Agenzia Nazionale di Valutazione del Sistema Universitario e della Ricerca''') is the Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of the University and Research Systems. ANVUR was established by a 2006 law with the objective of improving meritocracy in Italian academic research. It was based on [[Aeres]] in France and the [[Research Excellence Framework]] (REF) in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=anv&gt;[http://www.unive.it/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=161248 ANVUR - National Agency for the Evaluation of the University and Research Systems.] [[Università Ca' Foscari Venezia|Università Ca' Foscari]], 29 November 2013. Retrieved 17 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchitaly.it/en/understanding/overview/assessment/ Assessment.] Research Italy. Retrieved 17 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

ANVUR began to compile its assessment of Italian research, the "VQR" (eValuation of the Quality of Research) in November 2011, assessing 95 universities, 21 research agencies or institutes, and 17 inter-university consortia.&lt;ref name=anv/&gt;

The '''Abisko Scientific Research Station''' ('''ANS''') is a field [[research station]] managed by the [[Swedish Polar Research Secretariat]]. Situated on the south shore of Lake [[Torneträsk]], it lies at the edge of the [[Abisko National Park]]. The station conducts ecological, geological, geomorphological and meteorological research in subarctic environments and each year about 500 scientists visit from all over the world. The varied geological, topographical and climatic conditions of the area allow it to be inhabited by a range of [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. These features, which have caused the area to be given [[National Park]] status, also make it an important place for scientific research, particularly of [[:wikt:alpine|alpine]] and [[subalpine]] [[ecosystems]].

==The station==
The first proper field station to be established in the area dates back to 1903, however the official station has only been affiliated with the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] since 1935. The station holds meteorological datasets extending back to 1913, including air and soil temperature, precipitation and UV radiation. The research station has been the site of many long-term experiments investigating climate change impacts &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jonasson | first1 = C. | last2 = Sonesson | first2 = M. | last3 = Christensen | first3 = T.

Since December 2010 the station is managed by the [[Swedish Polar Research Secretariat]].

The research station today consists of [[laboratories]] and general workrooms containing a variety of scientific equipment, and also of various 'outposts' where research is carried out ''in situ''. It is used for research, teaching and meetings, and has a large collection of scientific books and papers available on site.

==Current research==

Though many research projects are carried out at the station regarding [[geography]] and [[biology]] in general, particular emphasis is placed on [[meteorology]] and [[plant ecology]].

Albert H. Crews Jr, USAF |website=Pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a [[USAF Test Pilot School]] graduate, he was selected as a military astronaut designee in the second group of [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]] astronauts on April 20, 1962, and assigned as a Dyna-Soar pilot on September 20, 1962. The Dyna-Soar program was cancelled in 1963. On November 12, 1965, he was selected as an astronaut in the first group for the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) program. He transferred to [[NASA]] Flight Crew Directorate at the [[Johnson Space Center]], [[Houston]], [[Texas]], in June 1969 when the MOL program was cancelled. He remained a pilot for NASA, flying such aircraft as the "[[Aero Spacelines Super Guppy|Super Guppy]]" outsize cargo transport, the [[B-57 Canberra|WB-57F]] atmospheric research aircraft and the [[Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory|OV-095 SAIL Space Shuttle simulator]] until he retired at age 65.

The '''Arctic Alaska-Chukotka terrane''' ('''AAC''') is a [[microcontinent]] that today encompasses the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]], [[Brooks Range]], and [[Seward Peninsula]] of northern Alaska; the [[Chukotka Peninsula]], [[New Siberia Islands]], and [[Wrangel Island]] in eastern Siberia; and the continental shelves of the [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]], and [[Chukchi Sea|Chukchi]] seas.&lt;ref name="Strauss-etal"&gt;{{Harvnb|Strauss|Hoiland|Ward|Johnson|2017|loc=Introduction, pp. 649–652}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Comparable in size to Greenland, the AAC is the largest of the Neoproterozoic–Early Paleozoic continental fragments now dispersed around the Arctic Ocean; some of which possibly formed the continent [[Arctida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Till|2016|loc=Arctic Alaska–Chukotka Microplate, p. 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAC originated on the shores of the [[Iapetus  Ocean]] and is a composite [[terrane]] made of fragments from the [[Baltica]], [[Laurentia]], and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] continents, as well as the ocean floor of the [[Panthalassa|Panthalassic ocean]].  The AAC has a complex geological history that includes the [[Grenville Orogeny|Grenville]], [[Timanide Orogen|Timanian]], [[Caledonian Orogeny|Caledonian]]–[[Alleghanian orogeny|Appalachian]], and [[Ellesmere Island|Ellesmerian]] [[Orogeny|orogenies]].&lt;ref name="Strauss-etal" /&gt;

The Proterozoic–Carboniferous histories of Arctic Alaska and Chukotka are similar but their Triassic–Jurassic histories are apparently distinct.  Whether or not they were separate blocks before the Mesozoic opening of the [[Amerasia Basin]] is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Till|2016|loc=Arctic Alaska and Chukotka—One Microplate or Two?, pp. 232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The age of the [[Basement (geology)|basement]] of the AAC remains enigmatic, hence also details about the microcontinent's ancient, tectonic history.  It is, nevertheless, clear from Neoproterozoic igneous rocks that the AAC was not originally part of Laurentia, but most likely Baltica.  The microcontinent was obviously involved in a series of magmatic events, beginning at {{Circa}} 1.6–1.4&amp;nbsp;{{Abbr|Ga|billion years ago}}, and ending in the [[Avalonia]]–[[Cadomian Orogeny|Cadomian]] orogeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Amato|Aleinikoff|Akinin|McClelland|2014|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Associated motion''' is a grammatical category whose main function is to associate a motion component to the event expressed by the verbal root.

This category is attested in [[Pama–Nyungan languages]], where it was first discovered (Koch 1984, Wilkins 1991), in [[Tacanan]] (Guillaume 2006, 2008, 2009), and in [[Rgyalrong language]]s (Jacques 2013).

Languages with Associated Motion present a contrast between association motion and purposive motion verb constructions, as in the following examples from Jacques (2013:202-3):

:(1) laχtɕʰa ɯ-kɯ-χtɯ jɤ-ari-a
::thing 3sg-nmlz-buy aor-go-1sg
::'I went to buy things'

:(2) laχtɕʰa ɕ-tɤ-χtɯ-t-a
::thing transloc-aor-buy-pst-1sg
::'I went to buy things'

Although both examples have the same English translation, they differ in that (2) with the translocative associated motion prefix ɕ- implies that the buying did take place, while (1) with the motion verb does not. The distinction made by the translocative is similar to the distinction made in "I went ''and'' bought things".

The '''Atkinson–Shiffrin model''' (also known as the '''multi-store model''' or '''modal model''') is a model of [[memory]] proposed in 1968 by [[Richard C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]] and [[Richard Shiffrin]].&lt;ref name=AtkinsonShiffrin1968 /&gt; The model asserts that human memory has three separate components: 
# a ''[[#Sensory register|sensory register]]'', where sensory information enters memory,
# a ''[[#Short-term store|short-term store]]'', also called ''working memory'' or ''short-term memory'', which receives and holds input from both the sensory register and the long-term store, and
# a ''[[#Long-term store|long-term store]]'', where information which has been rehearsed (explained below) in the short-term store is held indefinitely.

Since its first publication this model has come under much scrutiny and has been criticized for various reasons (described below).  However, it is notable for the significant influence it had in stimulating subsequent memory research.

==Summary==
[[File:Multistore model.png|thumb|327px|right|'''Multi-store model''': Atkinson and Shiffrin's (1968) original model of memory, consisting of the sensory register, short-term store, and long-term store.]]
The modal model of memories is an explanation of how memory processes work. The three-part multi-store model was first described by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968,&lt;ref name=AtkinsonShiffrin1968 /&gt; though the idea of distinct memory stores was by no means a new idea at the time. [[William James]] described a distinction between primary and secondary memory in 1890, where primary memory consisted of thoughts held for a short time in consciousness and secondary memory consisted of a permanent, unconscious store.&lt;ref name=James1890 /&gt; However, at the time the [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] of separate memory stores was a contested notion.  A summary of the evidence given for the distinction between long-term and short-term stores is given [[#Evidence for distinct stores|below]]. Additionally, Atkinson and Shiffrin included a sensory register alongside the previously theorized primary and secondary memory, as well as a variety of control processes which regulate the transfer of memory.

Following its first publication, multiple extensions of the model have been put forth such as a precategorical acoustic store,&lt;ref name=CrowderMorton1969 /&gt; the search of associative memory model,&lt;ref name=RaaijmakersShiffrin1981 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ShiffrinRaaijmakers1992/&gt; the perturbation model,&lt;ref name=Estes1972 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee1992 /&gt; and permastore.&lt;ref name=Bahrick1984 /&gt; Additionally, alternative frameworks have been proposed, such as procedural reinstatement,&lt;ref name=HealyEtAl1992 /&gt; a distinctiveness model,&lt;ref name=NeathCrowder1990 /&gt; and [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch's model of working memory]],&lt;ref name=BaddeleyHitch1974 /&gt; among others.

==Sensory register==
{{Main|Sensory memory}}
When an environmental stimulus is detected by the senses it is briefly available in what Atkinson and Shiffrin called the ''sensory registers'' (also ''sensory buffers'' or ''[[sensory memory]]''). Though this store is generally referred to as "the sensory register" or "sensory memory", it is actually composed of multiple registers, one for each sense. The sensory registers do not process the information carried by the stimulus, but rather detect and hold that information for use in short-term memory. For this reason Atkinson and Shiffrin also called the registers "buffers", as they prevent immense amounts of information from overwhelming higher-level cognitive processes. Information is only transferred to the short-term memory when attention is given to it, otherwise it decays rapidly and is forgotten.&lt;ref name=AtkinsonShiffrin1968 /&gt;

While it is generally agreed that there is a sensory register for each sense, most of the research in the area has focused on the visual and auditory systems.

===Iconic memory===
[[Iconic memory]], which is associated with the [[visual system]], is perhaps the most researched of the sensory registers. The original evidence suggesting sensory stores which are separate to short-term and long-term memory was experimentally demonstrated for the visual system using a [[tachistoscope]].&lt;ref name=Sperling1960 /&gt;

[[Iconic memory]] is only limited to field of vision. That is, as long as a stimulus has entered the field of vision there is no limit to the amount of visual information iconic memory can hold at any one time. As noted above, sensory registers do not allow for further processing of information, and as such iconic memory only holds information for visual stimuli such as shape, size, color and location (but not semantic meaning).&lt;ref name=Sperling1960 /&gt; As the higher-level processes are limited in their capacities, not all information from sensory memory can be conveyed. It has been argued that the momentary mental freezing of visual input allows for the selection of specific aspects which should be passed on for further memory processing.&lt;ref name=ColtheartLeaThompson1974 /&gt; The biggest limitation of iconic memory is the rapid decay of the information stored there; items in iconic memory decay after only 0.5-1.0 seconds.&lt;ref name=Sperling1960 /&gt;

===Echoic memory===
[[Echoic memory]], coined by [[Ulric Neisser]],&lt;ref name=Neisser1967 /&gt; refers to information that is registered by the [[auditory system]]. As with [[iconic memory]], echoic memory only holds superficial aspects of sound (e.g. pitch, tempo, or rhythm) and it has a nearly limitless capacity.&lt;ref name=DarwinTurveyCrowder1972 /&gt; Echoic memory is generally cited as having a duration of between 1.5 and 5 seconds depending on context&lt;ref name=DarwinTurveyCrowder1972 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Treisman1964 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman1969 /&gt; but has been shown to last up to 20 seconds in the absence of competing information.&lt;ref name=GlucksbergCowen1970 /&gt;

==Short-term store==
{{Main|Short-term memory}}
While much of the information in sensory memory decays and is forgotten, some is attended to. The information that is attended is transferred to the ''short-term store'' (also ''[[short-term memory]]'', ''[[working memory]]''; note that while these terms are often used interchangeably they were not originally intended to be used as such&lt;ref name=BaddeleyHitch1974 /&gt;).

===Duration===
As with sensory memory, the information that enters short-term memory decays and is lost, but the information in the short-term store has a longer duration, approximately 18–20 seconds when the information is not being actively rehearsed,&lt;ref name=PetersonPeterson1959 /&gt; though it is possible that this depends on modality and could be as long as 30 seconds.&lt;ref name=Posner1966 /&gt; Fortunately, the information can be held in the short-term store for much longer through what Atkinson and Shiffrin called [[memory rehearsal|rehearsal]]. For auditory information rehearsal can be taken in a literal sense: continually repeating the items. However, the term can be applied for any information that is attended to, such as when a visual image is intentionally held in mind. Finally, information in the short-term store does not have to be of the same modality as its sensory input. For example, written text which enters visually can be held as auditory information, and likewise auditory input can be visualized. On this model, rehearsal of information allows for it to be stored more permanently in the long-term store. Atkinson and Shiffrin discussed this at length for auditory and visual information but did not give much attention to the rehearsal/storage of other modalities due to the experimental difficulties of studying those modalities.&lt;ref name=AtkinsonShiffrin1968 /&gt;

===Capacity===
There is a limit to the amount of information that can be held in the short-term store: 7 ± 2 [[Chunking (psychology)|chunks]].&lt;ref name=Miller1956 /&gt; These chunks, which were noted by Miller in his seminal paper ''The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two'', are defined as independent items of information. It is important to note that some chunks are perceived as one unit though they could be broken down into multiple items, for example "1066" can be either the series of four digits "1, 0, 6, 6" or the semantically grouped item "1066" which is the year the [[Battle of Hastings]] was fought. [[Chunking (psychology)|Chunking]] allows for large amounts of information to be held in memory: 149283141066 is twelve individual items, well outside the limit of the short-term store, but it can be grouped semantically into the 4 chunks "[[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]][1492] ate[8] pie[314→3.14→[[pi|{{pi}}]]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]][1066]". Because short-term memory is limited in capacity, it severely limits the amount of information that can be attended to at any one time.

==Long-term store==
{{Main|Long-term memory}}
The ''long-term store'' (also ''[[long-term memory]]'') is a more or less permanent store.  Information that is stored here can be "copied" and transferred to the short-term store where it can be attended to and manipulated.

===Transfer from STS===
Information is postulated to enter the long-term store from the short-term store more or less automatically.  As Atkinson and Shiffrin model it, transfer from the short-term store to the long-term store is occurring for as long as the information is being attended to in the short-term store.  In this way, varying amounts of attention result in varying amounts of time in short-term memory.  Ostensibly, the longer an item is held in short-term memory, the stronger its memory trace will be in long-term memory. Some [[Confounding|extraneous variables]] include: participant differences (Personal ability of an individual, these differentiate each participant and their capacity levels), demand characteristics (Which is the participants knowledge about experiment and what they bring to the experiment), experimenter effect (which is the effects the researchers have on participants through their expectations and possibility of bias behavior for self-fulfillment results), non-standardized instructions and procedures (The effect on participants if they receive different instructions, and if no consistency in procedure, also impacts from variations of conditions).
Atkinson and Shiffrin cite evidence for this transfer mechanism in studies by Hebb (1961)&lt;ref name=Hebb1961 /&gt; and Melton (1963)&lt;ref name=Melton1963 /&gt; which show that repeated rote repetition enhances long-term memory. One may also think to the original [[Hermann Ebbinghaus|Ebbinghaus]] memory experiments showing that forgetting increases for items which are studied fewer times.&lt;ref name=Ebbinghaus /&gt; Finally, the authors note that there are stronger encoding processes than simple rote rehearsal, namely relating the new information to information which has already made its way into the long-term store.&lt;ref name=AtkinsonShiffrin1968 /&gt;

===Capacity and duration===
In this model, as with most models of memory, long-term memory is assumed to be nearly limitless in its duration and capacity. It is most often the case that brain structures begin to deteriorate and fail before any limit of learning is reached. This is not to assume that any item which is stored in long-term memory is accessible at any point in the lifetime.  Rather, it is noted that the connections, cues, or associations to the memory deteriorate; the memory remains intact but unreachable.&lt;ref name=AtkinsonShiffrin1968 /&gt;

==Evidence for distinct stores==
At the time of the original publication there was a schism in the field of memory on the issue of a single process or dual-process model of memory, the two processes referring to short-term and long-term memory.&lt;ref name=Melton1963 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Postman1964 /&gt; Atkinson and Shiffrin cite hippocampal lesion studies as compelling evidence for a separation of the two stores.&lt;ref name=AtkinsonShiffrin1968 /&gt; These studies showed that patients with bilateral damage to the hippocampal region had nearly no ability to form new long-term memories though their short-term memory remained intact.&lt;ref name=Milner1966 /&gt; One may also be familiar with similar evidence found through the study of [[Henry Molaison]], famously known as H.M., who underwent a severe bilateral medial temporal lobectomy which removed most of his hippocampal regions.  These data suggest that there is indeed a clear separation between the short-term and long-term stores.

==Criticism==

===Sensory register as a separate store===
One of the early and central criticisms to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model was the inclusion of the sensory registers as part of memory. Specifically, the original model seemed to describe the sensory registers as both a structure and a control process. Parsimony would suggest that if the sensory registers are actually control processes, there is no need for a tri-partite system.  Later revisions to the model addressed these claims and incorporated the sensory registers with the short-term store.&lt;ref name=AtkinsonShiffrin1971 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shiffrin1975 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shiffrin1976 /&gt;

===Division and nature of working memory===
Baddeley and Hitch have in turn called to question the specific structure of the short-term store, proposing that it is subdivided into multiple components.&lt;ref name=BaddeleyHitch1974 /&gt; While the different components were not specifically addressed in the original Atkinson-Shiffrin model, the authors do note that little research has been done investigating the different ways sensory modalities may be represented in the short-term store.&lt;ref name=AtkinsonShiffrin1968 /&gt; Thus the model of working memory given by Baddeley and Hitch should be viewed as a refinement of the original model.
:{{further|Baddeley's model of working memory}}

===Rehearsal as the sole transfer mechanism===
The model has been further criticized as suggesting that rehearsal is the key process which initiates and facilitates transfer of information into LTM. There is very little evidence supporting this hypothesis, and long-term recall can in fact be better predicted by a [[Levels-of-processing effect|levels-of-processing framework]]. In this framework, items which are encoded at a deeper, more semantic level are shown to have stronger traces in long-term memory.&lt;ref name=CraikLockhart1972 /&gt; This criticism is somewhat unfounded as Atkinson and Shiffrin clearly state a difference between rehearsal and coding, where coding is akin to elaborative processes which levels-of-processing would call deep-processing.&lt;ref name=AtkinsonShiffrin1968 /&gt; In this light, the levels-of-processing framework could be seen as more of an extension of the Atkinson-Shiffrin model rather than a refutation.&lt;ref name=Raaijmakers1993 /&gt;
:{{further|Levels-of-processing effect}}

===Division of long-term memory===
In the case of long-term memory, it is unlikely that different types of information, such as the motor skills to ride a bike, memory for vocabulary, and memory for personal life events are stored in the same fashion.  [[Endel Tulving]] notes the importance of encoding specificity in long-term memory.  To clarify, there are definite differences in the way information is stored depending on whether it is episodic (memories of events), procedural (knowledge of how to do things), or semantic (general knowledge).&lt;ref name=TulvingThompson1973 /&gt; A short (non-inclusive) example comes from the study of [[Henry Molaison]] (H.M.): learning a simple motor task (tracing a star pattern in a mirror), which involves implicit and procedural long-term storage, is unaffected by bilateral lesioning of the hippocampal regions while other forms of long-term memory, like vocabulary learning (semantic) and memories for events, are severely impaired.&lt;ref name=Milner1962 /&gt;

==Search of associative memory (SAM)==
Due to the above and other criticism through the 1970s, the original model underwent many revisions to account for phenomena it could not explain. The "search of associative memory" (SAM) model is the culmination of that work. The SAM model uses a two-phase memory system: short- and long-term stores. Unlike the original Atkinson–Shiffrin model, there is no sensory store in the SAM model.&lt;ref name=RaaijmakersShiffrin1981 /&gt;

===Short-term store===
Short-term store takes on the form of a buffer, which has a limited capacity. The model assumes a buffer rehearsal system in which the buffer has a size, ''r''. Items enter the short-term store and accompany other items that are already present in the buffer, until size ''r'' has been reached. Once the buffer is at full capacity,  when new items enter, they replace an item, ''r'', which already exists in the buffer. A probability of 1/''r'' determines which already existing item will be replaced from the buffer.&lt;ref name=RaaijmakersShiffrin1981 /&gt; In general, items that have been in the buffer for longer are more likely to be replaced by new items.&lt;ref name=PhillipsShiffrinAtkinson1967 /&gt;

===Long-term store===
The long-term store is responsible for storing relationships between different items and of items to their contexts. Context information refers to the situational and temporal factors present at the time when an item is in the short-term store, such as emotional feelings or environmental details. The amount of item-context information which is transferred to the long-term store is proportional to the amount of time that the item remains in the short-term store. On the other hand, the strength of the item-item associations is proportional to the amount of time that two items simultaneously existed in the short-term store.&lt;ref name=RaaijmakersShiffrin1981 /&gt;

===Retrieval from long-term store===
[[File:Retrieval in SAM.png|thumb|Simplified diagram of the steps involved in retrieving an item from the long-term store under the SAM model. Simplification of the diagram found in Raaijmakers &amp; Shiffrin, 1981.&lt;ref name=RaaijmakersShiffrin1981 /&gt;]]
It is best to show how items are recalled from the long-term store using an example. Assume a participant has just studied a list of word pairs and is now being tested on his memory of those pairs. If the prior list contained, ''blanket – ocean'', the test would be to recall ''ocean'' when prompted with ''blanket – ?''.

Memories stored in long-term store are retrieved through a logical process involving the assembly of cues, sampling, recovery, and evaluation of recovery. According to the model, when an item needs to be recalled from memory the individual assembles the various cues for the item in the short-term store. In this case, the cues would be any cues surrounding the pair ''blanket – ocean'', like the words that preceded and followed it, what the participant was feeling at the time, how far into the list the words were, etc.

Using these cues the individual determines which area of the long-term store to search and then samples any items with associations to the cues. This search is automatic and unconscious, which is how the authors would explain how an answer "pops" into one's head. The items which are eventually recovered, or recalled, are those with the strongest associations to the cue item, here ''blanket''. Once an item has been recovered it is evaluated, here the participant would decide whether ''blanket - [recovered word]'' matches ''blanket – ocean''. If there is a match, or if the participant believes there is a match, the recovered word is output. Otherwise the search starts from the beginning using different cues or weighting cues differently if possible.&lt;ref name=RaaijmakersShiffrin1981 /&gt;

===Recency effects===
The usefulness of the SAM model and in particular its model of the short-term store is often demonstrated by its application to the recency effect in free recall. When serial-position curves are applied to SAM, a strong recency effect is observed, but this effect is strongly diminished when a distractor, usually arithmetic, is placed in between study and test trials. The recency effect occurs because items at the end of the test list are likely to still be present in short-term store and therefore retrieved first. However, when new information is processed, this item enters the short-term store and displaces other information from it. When a distracting task is given after the presentation of all items, information from this task displaces the last items from short-term store, resulting in a substantial reduction of recency.&lt;ref name=RaaijmakersShiffrin1981 /&gt;

===Problems for the SAM model===
The SAM model faces serious problems in accounting for long-term recency data&lt;ref name=BjorkWhitten1974 /&gt; and long-range contiguity data.&lt;ref name=HowardKahana1999 /&gt; While both of these effects are observed, the short-term store cannot account for the effects. Since a distracting task after the presentation of word pairs or large interpresentation intervals filled with distractors would be expected to displace the last few studied items from the short-term store, recency effects are still observed. According to the rules of the short-term store, recency and contiguity effects should be eliminated with these distractors as the most recently studied items would no longer be present in the short-term memory. Currently, the SAM model competes with single-store free recall models of memory, such as the Temporal Context Model.&lt;ref name=HowardKahana2002/&gt; In this study the impact of age and level of maturation on participants ability to recall images from STM was investigated. It was hypothesised that students who fell in the age bracket of sixteen and 18 years would have greater recall ability and perform better on the STM recall imagery test than, eleven to thirteen year old.  Additionally, the original model assumes that items in a particular list the only significant associations between items are those formed during the study portion of an experiment. In other words, it does not account for the effects of prior knowledge about to-be-studied items. A more recent extension of the model incorporates various features which allow the model to account for memory store for the effects of prior semantic knowledge and prior episodic knowledge. For years there has been investigation regarding the level and capacity of STM. past research that has influenced the experiment is Atkinson - Shiffrin memory model. The model asserts. The experiment is focusing on the 'short term store', which holds information for the duration of twelve seconds and has a capacity of 7 ± 2 items. this has influenced the researches amount of images presented and how long they are viewed for. The extension proposes a store for preexisting semantic associations; a contextual drift mechanism allowing for decontextualisation of knowledge, e.g. if you first learned a banana was a fruit because you put it in the same class as apple, you do not always have to think of apples to know bananas are fruits; a memory search mechanism that uses both episodic and semantic associations, as opposed to a unitary mechanism; and a large lexicon including both words from prior lists and unpresented words.&lt;ref name=SirotinKimballKahana2005 /&gt;

[[File:Canines Parvovirus.jpg|thumb|Electron microscope image of canine parvovirus isolated using buoyant density centrifugation]]
'''Buoyant density centrifugation''' (also '''isopycnic centrifugation''') uses the concept of [[buoyancy]] to separate molecules in solution.

==Implementation==
Usually a [[caesium chloride]] (CsCl) solution is used, but in the general case it's usually approximately the same density as the molecules that are to be [[centrifuge]]d. The sample is put on top of the solution, and then the tube is spun at a very high speed for an extended time, at times lasting days. The CsCl molecules become densely packed toward the bottom, so even layers of different densities form.  Since the original solution was approximately the same density, they go to a level where their density and the CsCl density are the same, to which they form a sharp, distinctive band.

==Isotope separation==
This method very sharply separates molecules, and is so sharp that it can even separate different molecular isotopes from one another.

==DNA separation==
Buoyant density of majority of DNA is 1.7g/cm3 which is equal to density of 6M CsCl solution. Buoyant density of DNA changes with its GC content.

[[File:MACS_J1206.jpg|thumb|300px|This image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows the galaxy cluster [[MACS J1206]].
This is one of 25 clusters being studied as part of the CLASH (Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble) programme, a major project to build a library of scientific data on lensing clusters.]]
The '''Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble''' (CLASH) is a multi-wavelength census of 25 massive [[galaxy cluster]]s with [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] (ACS) and [[Wide Field Camera 3]] (WFC3) instruments of [[Hubble Space Telescope]] over a 3.5 year period (2010 - 2013).

The gravity of these massive clusters is powerful enough to visibly bend the path of light, somewhat like a magnifying glass and are thus useful tools for studying very distant objects. They also contribute to a range of topics in cosmology, as the precise nature of the lensed images encapsulates information about the properties of spacetime and the expansion of the cosmos.

[[File:CLASH Survey Brightest Cluster Galaxies and Simulations.jpg|thumb|left|CLASH Survey Brightest Cluster Galaxies and Simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLASH Survey Brightest Cluster Galaxies and Simulations|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1526a/|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As of November 2012, the CLASH has surveyed 20 clusters out of the 25. One of the [[galaxy cluster]]s, [[MACS J0647+7015]] was found to have [[gravitational lensing|gravitationally lensed]] the most distant [[galaxy]] ([[MACS0647-JD]]) then ever imaged, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1217/ Hubble helps find candidate for most distant object in the Universe yet observed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stsci.edu/~postman/CLASH/About.html Scientific Objectives of CLASH]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, one study utilizing CLASH data found that [[RX J1347.5-1145]] had intense gravitational bending of light such that 8 images of the same object were detected.&lt;ref name=kohl&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0021 F. Köhlinger  and R.W. Schmidt - Strong lensing in RX J1347.5-1145 revisited (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Gravitational lensing]])

The Principal Investigator of the CLASH program is [[Marc Postman]].

A '''comet seeker''' is a type of small [[telescope]] adapted especially to searching for [[comet]]s: commonly of short [[focal length]] and large [[aperture]], in order to secure the greatest brilliancy of [[light]].

For example, in 1842 a 4-inch (10&amp;nbsp;cm) aperture Comet Seeker was added to [[Markree Observatory]], which was used to discover [[9 Metis]] in 1848.

[[Image:STS-37 Launch.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Launch of ''Atlantis'' carrying the observatory to Earth orbit ([[STS-37]])]]
[[File:NASA image STS37-051-021 Jay Apt on the first EVA of STS-37 with CGRO.jpg|thumb|Astronaut Jay Apt in the Space Shuttle bay with the observatory partially deployed but still attached to the Shuttle's robotic arm]]
The '''Compton Gamma Ray Observatory''' ('''CGRO''') was a [[space observatory]] detecting [[photons]] with [[photon energy|energies]] from 20&amp;nbsp;k[[Electronvolt#Properties|eV]] to 30&amp;nbsp;GeV, in Earth orbit from 1991 to 2000. It featured four main telescopes in one spacecraft, covering X-rays and [[gamma ray]]s, including various specialized sub-instruments and detectors. Following 14 years of effort, the observatory was launched from [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']] during [[STS-37]] on April 5, 1991, and operated until its deorbit on June 4, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/epo/brochures/compton/bro5.html |title=Gamma-Ray Astronomy in the Compton Era: The Instruments |accessdate=2007-12-07 |work=Gamma-Ray Astronomy in the Compton Era |publisher=NASA/ GSFC }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was deployed in [[low earth orbit]] at {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}} to avoid the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]. It was the heaviest astrophysical payload ever flown at that time at {{convert|17000|kg}}.

Costing $617&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=sfn2000/&gt; the CGRO was part of [[NASA]]'s "[[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]]" series, along with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], and the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_NASA_Great_Observatories_PS.html NASA's Great Observatories]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second of the series to be launched into space, following the Hubble Space Telescope. CGRO was named after [[Arthur Holly Compton]] ([[Washington University in St. Louis]]), Nobel prize winner, for work involved with gamma ray physics. CGRO was built by [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] (now [[Northrop Grumman]] Aerospace Systems) in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], [[California]]. CGRO was an international collaboration and additional contributions came from the [[European Space Agency]] and various universities, as well as the U.S. [[Naval Research Laboratory]].

Successors to CGRO include the ESA [[INTEGRAL]] spacecraft (launched 2002), NASA's [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] (launched 2004) and NASA's [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] (launched 2008); all three remain operational as of 2017.

==Instruments==
CGRO carried a complement of four instruments that covered an unprecedented six decades of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], from 20 [[electronvolt|keV]] to 30 GeV (from 0.02 MeV to 30000 MeV). In order of increasing spectral energy coverage:

===BATSE===
The '''Burst and Transient Source Experiment''', ('''BATSE''') by NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] searched the sky for [[gamma ray burst]]s (20 to &gt;600 keV) and conducted full sky surveys for long-lived sources. It consisted of eight identical detector modules, one at each of the satellite's corners. Each module consisted of both a [[Gamma spectroscopy#Scintillation detectors|NaI(Tl)]] Large Area Detector (LAD) covering the 20 keV to ~2 MeV range, 50.48&amp;nbsp;cm in dia by 1.27&amp;nbsp;cm thick, and a 12.7&amp;nbsp;cm dia by 7.62&amp;nbsp;cm thick NaI Spectroscopy Detector, which extended the upper energy range to 8 MeV, all surrounded by a plastic scintillator in active anti-coincidence to veto the large background rates due to cosmic rays and trapped radiation. Sudden increases in the LAD rates triggered a high-speed data storage mode, the details of the burst being read out to [[telemetry]] later. Bursts were typically detected at rates of roughly one per day over the 9-year CGRO mission. A strong burst could result in the observation of many thousands of gamma rays within a time interval ranging from ~0.1 s up to about 100 s.

===OSSE===
The '''Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment''', ('''OSSE'''), by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] detected gamma rays entering the field of view of any of four detector modules, which could be pointed individually, and were effective in the 0.05 to 10 MeV range. Each detector had a central [[Gamma spectroscopy#Scintillation detectors|scintillation spectrometer]] crystal of [[Gamma spectroscopy#Scintillation detectors|NaI(Tl)]] 12 in (303&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter, by 4 in (102&amp;nbsp;mm) thick, optically coupled at the rear to a 3 in (76.2&amp;nbsp;mm) thick [[Caesium iodide|CsI]](Na) crystal of similar diameter, viewed by seven [[photomultiplier tube]]s, operated as a [[Phoswich Detector|phoswich]]: i.e., particle and gamma-ray events from the rear produced slow-rise time (~1 μs) pulses, which could be electronically distinguished from pure NaI events from the front, which produced faster (~0.25 μs) pulses. Thus the CsI backing crystal acted as an active [[Electronic anticoincidence|anticoincidence]] shield, vetoing events from the rear. A further barrel-shaped CsI shield, also in electronic anticoincidence, surrounded the central detector on the sides and provided coarse collimation, rejecting gamma rays and charged particles from the sides or most of the forward field-of-view (FOV). A finer level of angular collimation was provided by a tungsten slat collimator grid within the outer CsI barrel, which collimated the response to a 3.8° x 11.4° FWHM rectangular FOV. A plastic scintillator across the front of each module vetoed charged particles entering from the front. The four detectors were typically operated in pairs of two. During a gamma-ray source observation, one detector would take observations of the source, while the other would slew slightly off source to measure the background levels. The two detectors would routinely switch roles, allowing for more accurate measurements of both the source and background. The instruments could [[slew (spacecraft)|slew]] with a speed of approximately 2 degrees per second.

===COMPTEL===
The '''Imaging Compton Telescope''', ('''COMPTEL''') by the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]], the [[University of New Hampshire]], [[Netherlands Institute for Space Research]], and ESA's Astrophysics Division was tuned to the 0.75-30 MeV energy range and determined the angle of arrival of photons to within a degree and the energy to within five percent at higher energies. The instrument had a field of view of one [[steradian]]. For cosmic gamma-ray events, the experiment required two nearly simultaneous interactions, in a set of front and rear scintillators. Gamma rays would [[Compton scattering|Compton scatter]] in a forward detector module, where the interaction energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', given to the recoil electron was measured, while the Compton scattered photon would then be caught in one of a second layer of scintillators to the rear, where its total energy, ''E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', would be measured. From these two energies, ''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', the Compton scattering angle, angle θ, can be determined, along with the total energy, ''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', of the incident photon. The positions of the interactions, in both the front and rear scintillators, was also measured. The [[Euclidean vector|vector]], '''V''', connecting the two interaction points determined a direction to the sky, and the angle θ about this direction, defined a cone about '''V''' on which the source of the photon must lie, and a corresponding "event circle" on the sky. Because of the requirement for a near coincidence between the two interactions, with the correct delay of a few nanoseconds, most modes of background production were strongly suppressed. From the collection of many event energies and event circles, a map of the positions of sources, along with their photon fluxes and spectra, could be determined.

{{Main|Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope}}
The '''Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope''', ('''EGRET''') measured high energy (20 MeV to 30 GeV) gamma ray source positions to a fraction of a degree and photon energy to within 15 percent. EGRET was developed by NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]], and [[Stanford University]]. Its detector operated on the principle of electron-[[positron]] [[pair production]] from high energy photons interacting in the detector. The tracks of the high-energy electron and positron created were measured within the detector volume, and the axis of the ''V'' of the two emerging particles projected to the sky. Finally, their total energy was measured in a large [[calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimeter]] [[scintillation detector]] at the rear of the instrument.

==Results==
[[File:Moon egret.jpg|thumb|The Moon as seen by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, in gamma rays of greater than 20 MeV. These are produced by [[cosmic ray]] bombardment of its surface. The [[Sun]], which has no similar surface of high [[atomic number]] to act as target for cosmic rays, cannot be seen at all at these energies, which are too high to emerge from primary nuclear reactions, such as solar nuclear fusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/epo/news/gammoon.html EGRET Detection of Gamma Rays from the Moon]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Basic results===
*The EGRET instrument conducted the first all sky survey above 100 MeV. Using four years of data it discovered 271 sources, 170 of which were unidentified.
*The COMPTEL instrument completed an all sky map of {{chem|26|Al}} (a radioactive [[isotopes of aluminium|isotope of aluminum]]).
*The OSSE instrument completed the most comprehensive survey of the galactic center, and discovered a possible [[antimatter]] "cloud" above the center.
*The BATSE instrument averaged one gamma ray burst event detection per day for a total of approximately 2700 detections. It definitively showed that the majority of gamma-ray bursts must originate in distant galaxies, not nearby in our own [[Milky Way]], and therefore must be enormously energetic.
*The discovery of the first four [[Soft gamma repeater|soft gamma ray repeaters]]; these sources were relatively weak, mostly below 100 keV and had unpredictable periods of activity and inactivity
*The separation of GRBs into two time profiles: short duration GRBs that last less than 2 seconds, and long duration GRBs that last longer than this.

===GRB 990123===
{{Main|GRB 990123}}
[[GRB 990123|Gamma ray burst 990123]] (23 January 1999) was one of the brightest bursts recorded at the time, and was the first GRB with an optical afterglow observed during the prompt gamma ray emission (a reverse shock flash). This allowed astronomers to measure a [[redshift]] of 1.6 and a distance of 3.2 Gpc. Combining the measured energy of the burst in gamma-rays and the distance, the total emitted energy assuming an isotropic explosion could be deduced and resulted in the direct conversion of approximately two solar masses into energy. This finally convinced the community that GRB afterglows resulted from highly collimated explosions, which strongly reduced the needed energy budget.

===Miscellaneous results===
*The completion of both a [[pulsar]] survey and a [[supernova remnant]] survey
*The discovery of [[Terrestrial gamma-ray flash|terrestrial gamma ray sources]] in 1994 that came from [[Cumulonimbus cloud|thunderclouds]]

It was deployed to an altitude of 450&amp;nbsp;km on April 7, 1991 when it was first launched.&lt;ref name="heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov"&gt;[https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/epo/news/reboost.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the orbit decayed and needed re-boosting to prevent atmospheric entry sooner than desired.&lt;ref name="heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov"/&gt;
Re-boosts:&lt;ref name="heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov"/&gt;
*1993 from 340&amp;nbsp;km to 450&amp;nbsp;km altitude
*June 1997 440&amp;nbsp;km to 515&amp;nbsp;km altitude

==Intentional/controlled De-orbit==
After one of its three gyroscopes failed in December 1999, the observatory was deliberately de-orbited. At the time, the observatory was still operational; however the failure of another gyroscope would have made de-orbiting much more difficult and dangerous. With some controversy, NASA decided in the interest of public safety that a controlled crash into an ocean was preferable to letting the craft come down on its own at random.&lt;ref name=sfn2000&gt;[http://spaceflightnow.com/cgrodeorbit/index.html NASA space telescope heads for fiery crash into Pacific]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope or the International Space Station, it was not designed for on-orbit repair and refurbishment. It entered the Earth's atmosphere on 4 June 2000, with the debris that did not burn up ("six 1,800-pound aluminum I-beams and parts made of titanium, including more than 5,000 bolts") falling into the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/05/us/satellite-marked-for-extinction-plunges-into-the-sea-on-target.html Satellite Marked for Extinction Plunges Into the Sea, on Target]&lt;/ref&gt;

This de-orbit was NASA's first intentional controlled de-orbit of a satellite.

The '''Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils''' ('''CCLRC''') was a [[United Kingdom|UK]] government body that carried out civil research in [[science]] and [[engineering]].

== Activities ==
The CCLRC was created on 1 April 1995 as a [[non-departmental public body]] from the laboratories of the previous [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] including 1942 staff and an annual turnover of £106 million which had temporarily been controlled by the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]]. It operated at three locations:

*[[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]], near [[Didcot]] in [[Oxfordshire]], incorporating the [[ISIS neutron source]]
*[[Daresbury Laboratory]]. at [[Daresbury]] in [[Cheshire]]
*[[Chilbolton Observatory]], near [[Stockbridge, Hampshire|Stockbridge]] in [[Hampshire]]

The [[Diamond Light Source]], was developed by the CCLRC at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] and established as an independent company.

The CCLRC was established:

a) to promote high quality scientific and engineering research by providing facilities and technical expertise in support of basic, strategic and applied research programmes;

b) to support the advancement of knowledge and technology, thereby contributing to the economic competitiveness of Our United Kingdom and the quality of life;

c) to provide advice, disseminate knowledge, and promote public understanding in the fields of science, engineering and technology.

Which in practice meant that it administered the UK's large scale facilities for materials and biomolecular research, laser and space science and alternative energy exploration on behalf of the government, the other UK research funding bodies, universities, and corporate research and development.

Over eighty per cent of the funding for the programmes carried out by the CCLRC came through partnership with other UK Research Councils, whilst the remaining twenty per cent came through partnership with industrial and overseas organisations. Some 10,000 researchers are estimated to have used CLRC's facilities and services each year - usually working in close collaboration with CLRC's support scientists and engineers to get the best from the facilities and expertise available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scitech.ac.uk/Publications/ar/archive/CCLRC/pdfs/CCLRCAnnualReport1999-2000.pdf CCLRC Annual Report 1999–2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as operating as a single entity, the Council (CCLRC) also operated its own wholly owned trading
subsidiary, Central Laboratory Innovation and Knowledge Transfer Limited (CLIK).

By 2006 annual expenditure had nearly doubled since CCLRC's foundation to £199.8 million as the Council's international role expanded to include the payment of the UK's subscriptions to facilities at the [[Institut Laue–Langevin|ILL]] and [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility|ESRF]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scitech.ac.uk/Publications/ar/archive/CCLRC/pdfs/CCLRCAnnualReport2005-2006.pdf CCLRC Annual Report 2005–2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2007 CCLRC merged with [[PPARC]] to form the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] so that a single organisation was responsible for providing UK scientists with access to large scientific facilities in the UK and elsewhere in the world, including [[CERN]], [[European Space Agency|ESA]] and [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]].

== Branding ==
Given the wide breadth of its mission there was plenty of room for the CCLRC staff to promote different activities of the Council. Consequently its branding was always a problem.

Between 1994 and 1995 while the laboratories were temporarily operated by the EPSRC, the abbreviation "DRAL" was used to brand them as distinct from the funding Council. When the CCLRC was first established in 1995 the Director General of Research Councils did not want it to be confused with the funding Councils, so he did not want the abbreviation to include the letters "RC" at the end, but to be simply "CCL" - Council of the Central Laboratories. This only lasted for a few months when the accepted abbreviation became "CLRC" - Central Laboratory of the Research Councils. Since the full name included an extra word a confusion was created as to why the abbreviation appeared to be that of a different name than the actual one. To end this confusion, in 2002 the abbreviation was changed to the complete acronym of "CCLRC".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17625">The '''Fifth Generation Computer Systems''' [Present and Future] (FGCS) was an initiative by Japan's [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]], begun in 1982, to create a computer using [[massively parallel computing]]/processing. It was to be the result of a massive government/industry research project in Japan during the 1980s. It aimed to create an "epoch-making computer" with supercomputer-like performance and to provide a platform for future developments in [[artificial intelligence]]. There was also an unrelated Russian project also named as a fifth-generation computer (see [[Kronos (computer)]]).

In his "Trip report" paper,&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Ehud Y. "The fifth generation project—a trip report." Communications of the ACM 26.9 (1983): 637-641.&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Ehud Shapiro (which focused the FGCS project on [[concurrent logic programming]] as the software foundation for the project) captured the rationale and motivations driving this huge project: &lt;blockquote&gt;"As part of Japan's effort to become a leader in the computer industry, the Institute for New Generation Computer Technology has launched a revolutionary ten-year plan for the development of large computer systems which will be applicable to knowledge information processing systems. These Fifth Generation computers will be built around the concepts of logic programming. In order to refute the accusation that Japan exploits knowledge from abroad without contributing any of its own, this project will stimulate original research and will make its results available to the international research community."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "fifth generation" was intended to convey the system as being a leap beyond existing machines. In the [[history of computing hardware]], computers using [[vacuum tube]]s were called the first generation; [[transistor]]s and [[diode]]s, the second; [[integrated circuit]]s, the third; and those using [[microprocessor]]s, the fourth. Whereas previous computer generations had focused on increasing the number of logic elements in a single CPU, the fifth generation, it was widely believed at the time, would instead turn to massive numbers of CPUs for added performance.

The project was to create the computer over a ten-year period, after which it was considered ended and investment in a new "sixth generation" project would begin. Opinions about its outcome are divided: either it was a failure, or it was ahead of its time.

== History ==
In the late 1960s till the early 1970s, there was much talk about "generations" of computer hardware &amp;mdash; usually "three generations".

# First generation: Thermionic vacuum tubes. Mid-1940s. IBM pioneered the arrangement of vacuum tubes in pluggable modules. The [[IBM 650]] was a first-generation computer.
# Second generation: Transistors. 1956. The era of miniaturization begins. Transistors are much smaller than vacuum tubes, draw less power, and generate less heat. Discrete transistors are soldered to circuit boards, with interconnections accomplished by stencil-screened conductive patterns on the reverse side. The [[IBM 7090]] was a second-generation computer.
# Third generation: Integrated circuits (silicon chips containing multiple transistors). 1964. A pioneering example is the ACPX module used in the IBM 360/91, which, by stacking layers of silicon over a ceramic substrate, accommodated over 20 transistors per chip; the chips could be packed together onto a circuit board to achieve unheard-of logic densities. The IBM 360/91 was a hybrid second- and third-generation computer.
Omitted from this taxonomy is the "zeroth-generation" computer based on metal gears (such as the [[IBM 407]]) or mechanical relays (such as the Mark I), and the post-third-generation computers based on Very Large Scale Integrated ([[VLSI]]) circuits.

There was also a parallel set of generations for software:
# [[First-generation programming language|First generation]]: [[Machine language]].
# [[Second-generation programming language|Second generation]]: [[Low-level programming language]]s such as [[Assembly language]].
# [[Third-generation programming language|Third generation]]: Structured [[high-level programming language]]s such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[COBOL]] and [[FORTRAN]].
# [[Fourth-generation programming language|Fourth generation]]: Domain-specific [[high-level programming language]]s such as [[SQL]] (for [[database]] access) and [[TeX]] (for text formatting)

Throughout these multiple generations up to the 1990s, Japan had largely been a follower in the computing arena, building computers following U.S. and British leads. The [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] (MITI) decided to attempt to break out of this follow-the-leader pattern, and in the mid-1970s started looking, on a small scale, into the future of computing. They asked the [[Japan Information Processing Development Center]] (JIPDEC) to indicate a number of future directions, and in 1979 offered a three-year contract to carry out more in-depth studies along with industry and academia. It was during this period that the term "fifth-generation computer" started to be used.

Prior to the 1970s, MITI guidance had successes such as an improved steel industry, the creation of the oil [[supertanker]], the automotive industry, consumer electronics, and computer memory. MITI decided that the future was going to be [[information technology]]. However, the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] language, in both written and spoken form, presented and still presents major obstacles for computers. These hurdles could not be taken lightly. So MITI held a conference and invited people around the world to help them.

The primary fields for investigation from this initial project were:

* Inference computer technologies for knowledge processing
* Computer technologies to process large-scale data bases and knowledge bases
* High performance workstations
* Distributed functional computer technologies
* Super-computers for scientific calculation

The project imagined an "epoch-making computer" with supercomputer-like performance using massively parallel computing/processing. The aim was to build parallel computers for artificial intelligence applications using concurrent logic programming. The FGCS project and its vast findings contributed greatly to the development of the concurrent logic programming field.

The target defined by the FGCS project was to develop "Knowledge Information Processing systems" (roughly meaning, applied [[Artificial Intelligence]]). The chosen tool to implement this goal was [[logic programming]]. Logic programming approach as was characterized by Maarten Van Emden – one of its founders – as:&lt;ref&gt;Van Emden, Maarten H., and Robert A. Kowalski. "The semantics of predicate logic as a programming language." Journal of the ACM 23.4 (1976): 733-742.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The use of logic to express information in a computer.
* The use of logic to present problems to a computer.
* The use of logical inference to solve these problems.

More technically, it can be summed up in two equations:

* ''Program'' = ''Set of axioms''.
* ''Computation'' = ''Proof of a statement from axioms''.

The Axioms typically used are universal axioms of a restricted form, called [[Horn clauses|Horn-clauses]] or [[Definite clause|definite-clauses]]. The statement proved in a computation is an existential statement. The proof is constructive, and provides values for the existentially quantified variables: these values constitute the output of the computation.

Logic programming was thought as something that unified various gradients of computer science ([[software engineering]], [[databases]], [[computer architecture]] and [[artificial intelligence]]). It seemed that logic programming was the "missing link" between knowledge engineering and parallel computer architectures.

In 1982, during a visit to the ICOT, [[Ehud Shapiro]] invented Concurrent [[Prolog]], a novel concurrent programming language that integrated logic programming and concurrent programming. Concurrent Prolog is a logic programming language designed for concurrent programming and parallel execution. It is a [[Process-oriented programming|process oriented language]], which embodies [[dataflow]] synchronization and guarded-command [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation|indeterminacy]] as its basic control mechanisms. [[Ehud Shapiro|Shapiro]] described the language in a Report marked as ICOT Technical Report 003,&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro E. A subset of Concurrent Prolog and its interpreter, ICOT Technical Report TR-003, Institute for New Generation Computer Technology, Tokyo, 1983. Also in Concurrent Prolog: Collected Papers, E. Shapiro (ed.), MIT Press, 1987, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; which presented a Concurrent Prolog [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] written in Prolog. Shapiro's work on Concurrent Prolog inspired a change in the direction of the FGCS from focusing on parallel implementation of Prolog to the focus on [[Logic programming#Concurrent logic programming|concurrent logic programming]] as the software foundation for the project. It also inspired the concurrent logic programming language Guarded Horn Clauses (GHC) by Ueda, which was the basis of KL1, the programming language that was finally designed and implemented by the FGCS project as its core programming language.

The project imagined a [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]] computer running on top of massive [[database]]s (as opposed to a traditional [[filesystem]]) using a [[logic programming language]] to define and access the data. They envisioned building a prototype machine with performance between 100M and 1G LIPS, where a LIPS is a ''[[inference|Logical Inference]] Per Second.'' At the time typical workstation machines were capable of about 100k LIPS. They proposed to build this machine over a ten-year period, 3 years for initial R&amp;D, 4 years for building various subsystems, and a final 3 years to complete a working prototype system. In 1982 the government decided to go ahead with the project, and established the '''Institute for New Generation Computer Technology''' ([[ICOT]]) through joint investment with various Japanese computer companies.

=== Implementation ===

So ingrained was the belief that parallel computing was the future of all performance gains that the Fifth-Generation project generated a great deal of apprehension in the computer field. After having seen the Japanese take over the [[consumer electronics]] field during the 1970s and apparently doing the same in the [[automotive]] world during the 1980s, the Japanese in the 1980s had a reputation for invincibility. Soon parallel projects were set up in the US as the [[Strategic Computing Initiative]] and the [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation]] (MCC), in the UK as [[Alvey]], and in Europe as the [[European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology]] (ESPRIT), as well as ECRC ([[European Computer Research Centre]]) in [[Munich]], a collaboration between [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] in Britain, [[Groupe Bull|Bull]] in France, and [[Siemens]] in Germany.

Five running [[Parallel Inference Machine]]s (PIM) were eventually produced: PIM/m, PIM/p, PIM/i, PIM/k, PIM/c. The project also produced applications to run on these systems, such as the parallel [[database management system]] Kappa, the [[legal reasoning system]] ''[[HELIC-II]]'', and the automated [[Automated theorem prover|theorem prover]] ''[[MGTP]]'', as well as applications to [[bioinformatics]].

=== Failure ===

The FGCS Project did not meet with commercial success for reasons similar to the [[Lisp machine]] companies and [[Thinking Machines Corporation|Thinking Machines]]. The highly parallel computer architecture was eventually surpassed in speed by less specialized hardware (for example, Sun workstations and [[Intel]] [[x86]] machines). The project did produce a new generation of promising Japanese researchers. But after the FGCS Project, [[MITI]] stopped funding large-scale computer research projects, and the research momentum developed by the FGCS Project dissipated. However MITI/ICOT embarked on a Sixth Generation Project in the 1990s.

A primary problem was the choice of concurrent logic programming as the bridge between the parallel computer architecture and the use of logic as a knowledge representation and problem solving language for AI applications. This never happened cleanly; a number of languages were developed, all with their own limitations. In particular, the committed choice feature of [[concurrent constraint logic programming]] interfered with the logical semantics of the languages.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Hewitt [https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3036 Inconsistency Robustness in Logic Programming] ArXiv 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem was that existing CPU performance quickly pushed through the "obvious" barriers that experts perceived in the 1980s, and the value of parallel computing quickly dropped to the point where it was for some time used only in niche situations. Although a number of [[workstation]]s of increasing capacity were designed and built over the project's lifespan, they generally found themselves soon outperformed by "off the shelf" units available commercially.

The project also suffered from being on the wrong side of the technology curve. During its lifespan, [[GUI]]s became mainstream in computers; the [[internet]] enabled locally stored databases to become distributed; and even simple research projects provided better real-world results in data mining.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Moreover, the project found that the promises of [[logic programming]] were largely negated by the use of committed choice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

At the end of the ten-year period, the project had spent over ¥50 billion (about US$400 million at 1992 exchange rates) and was terminated without having met its goals. The workstations had no appeal in a market where general purpose systems could now take over their job and even outrun them. This is parallel to the Lisp machine market, where rule-based systems such as [[CLIPS]] could run on general-purpose computers, making expensive Lisp machines unnecessary.&lt;ref name='HendlerEditorial'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendler|first=James|title=Avoiding Another AI Winter|journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems|date=1 March 2008|volume=23|issue=2|pages=2–4|doi=10.1109/MIS.2008.20|url=http://csdl2.computer.org/comp/mags/ex/2008/02/mex2008020002.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212012656/http://csdl2.computer.org/comp/mags/ex/2008/02/mex2008020002.pdf|archivedate=12 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ahead of its time ===

In spite of the possibility of considering the project a failure, many of the approaches envisioned in the Fifth-Generation project, such as logic programming distributed over massive knowledge-bases, are now being re-interpreted in current technologies. For example, the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) employs several layers of logic-based knowledge representation systems. It appears, however, that these new technologies reinvented rather than leveraged approaches investigated under the Fifth-Generation initiative.

In the early 21st century, many flavors of '''parallel computing''' began to proliferate, including [[multi-core]] architectures at the low-end and [[massively parallel (computing)|massively parallel processing]] at the high end. When [[clock speed]]s of CPUs began to move into the 3–5&amp;nbsp;GHz range, [[CPU power dissipation]] and other problems became more important. The ability of [[industry]] to produce ever-faster single CPU systems (linked to [[Moore's Law]] about the periodic doubling of transistor counts) began to be threatened. Ordinary consumer machines and [[game console]]s began to have parallel processors like the [[Intel Core]], [[AMD K10]], and [[Cell (microprocessor)]]. [[Graphics card]] companies like Nvidia and AMD began introducing large parallel systems like [[CUDA]] and open(CL). Again, however, it is not clear that these developments were facilitated in any significant way by the Fifth-Generation project.

In summary, a strong case can be made that the Fifth-Generation project was ahead of its time, but it is debatable whether this counters or justifies claims that it was a failure.

{{Standard model of particle physics}}
In supersymmetry theories of [[particle physics]], a '''gaugino''' is the hypothetical [[fermion|fermionic]] supersymmetric [[field quantum]] ([[superpartner]]) of a [[gauge field]], as predicted by [[gauge theory]] combined with [[supersymmetry]]. All gauginos have spin 1/2, except for gravitino (spin 3/2).

In the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model]] the following gauginos exist:

* The [[gluino]] (symbol {{SubatomicParticle|gluino}}) is the superpartner of the [[gluon]], and hence carries [[color charge]].
* The [[gravitino]] (symbol {{SubatomicParticle|gravitino}}) is the supersymmetric partner of the [[graviton]].
* Three '''winos'''&lt;!--'Wino (particle)' redirects here--&gt; (symbol {{SubatomicParticle|Wino+-}} and W͂&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are the superpartners of the [[Electroweak interaction|W bosons]] of the SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; gauge fields.
* The '''bino'''&lt;!--'Bino (particle)' redirects here--&gt; is the superpartner of the U(1) gauge field corresponding to [[weak hypercharge]].

Sometimes the term "electroweakinos" is used to refer to winos and binos and on occasion also higgsinos.&lt;ref&gt;Gori, Stefania, et al. "Prospects for electroweakino discovery at a 100 TeV hadron collider." Journal of High Energy Physics 2014.12 (2014): 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mixing==

Gauginos mix{{clarify|date=March 2017}} with [[higgsino]]s, the superpartners of the [[Higgs field]]'s degrees of freedom, to form [[mass eigenstate]]s called [[neutralino]]s, which are electrically neutral, and [[chargino]]s, which are electrically charged.

In many supersymmetric models{{clarify|why did the focus shift from MSSM to general SUSY models?|date=March 2017}}, the lightest [[Lightest Supersymmetric Particle|supersymmetric particle]] (LSP), often a [[neutralino]] such as the [[photino]], is stable. In that case it is a [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]] and a candidate for [[dark matter]].{{elucidate|paragraph is a discussion of supersymmetric models and the LSP, but the relevance to gauginos is left ambiguous|date=March 2017}}

==Biography==
Bliznakov was born in 1920 in [[Berkovitsa]], Bulgaria. After graduating in chemistry in 1943 from Sofia University he worked in industry until 1946, when he joined the [[University of Varna]] as an assistant in inorganic and [[physical chemistry]]. In 1949 he joined the Department of Physical Chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute in [[Sofia]] (now the [[University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy]]) as an assistant where he stayed until moving to the Department of Inorganic Chemistry at [[Sofia University]] in 1951, becoming full professor and head of department in 1960. He stayed in that post until 1989, serving as university rector from 1981 to 1985.&lt;ref name=Lazarov&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lazarov |first=D. |year=2004 |title=115 years of university inorganic chemistry |journal=Annual of the University of Sofia Faculty of Chemistry |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=19–30 |url=http://www.chem.uni-sofia.bg/annual/pdf/Tom97-2004_book1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High-performance liquid chromatography''' ('''HPLC'''; formerly referred to as '''high-pressure liquid chromatography''') is a technique in [[analytical chemistry]] used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. It relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid [[solvent]] containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid [[adsorption|adsorbent material]]. Each component in the sample interacts slightly differently with the adsorbent material, causing different flow rates for the different components and leading to the separation of the components as they flow out of the column.

HPLC has been used for manufacturing (''e.g.'', during the production process of pharmaceutical and biological products), legal (''e.g.'', detecting performance enhancement drugs in urine), research (''e.g.'', separating the components of a complex biological sample, or of similar synthetic chemicals from each other), and medical (''e.g.'', detecting vitamin D levels in blood serum) purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gerber | first1 = F. | last2 = Krummen | first2 = M. | last3 = Potgeter | first3 = H. | last4 = Roth | first4 = A. | last5 = Siffrin | first5 = C. | last6 = Spoendlin | first6 = C. | doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2004.02.056 | title = Practical aspects of fast reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using 3μm particle packed columns and monolithic columns in pharmaceutical development and production working under current good manufacturing practice | journal = Journal of Chromatography A | volume = 1036 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–133 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15146913| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chromatography]] can be described as a [[mass transfer]] process involving [[adsorption]].  HPLC relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid and a sample mixture through a column filled with adsorbent, leading to the separation of the sample components. The active component of the column, the adsorbent, is typically a granular material made of solid particles (''e.g.'', [[silica]], polymers, etc.), 2–50 μm in size.  The components of the sample mixture are separated from each other due to their different degrees of interaction with the adsorbent particles.  The pressurized liquid is typically a mixture of solvents (''e.g.'', water, acetonitrile and/or methanol) and is referred to as a "mobile phase".  Its composition and [[temperature]] play a major role in the separation process by influencing the interactions taking place between sample components and adsorbent. These interactions are physical in nature, such as hydrophobic (dispersive), dipole–dipole and ionic, most often a combination.

HPLC is distinguished from traditional ("low pressure") [[Chromatography#Liquid chromatography|liquid chromatography]] because operational pressures are significantly higher (50–350 bar), while ordinary liquid chromatography typically relies on the force of gravity to pass the mobile phase through the column. Due to the small sample amount separated in analytical HPLC, typical column dimensions are 2.1–4.6&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, and 30–250&amp;nbsp;mm length.  Also HPLC columns are made with smaller adsorbent particles (2–50 μm in average particle size).  This gives HPLC superior resolving power (the ability to distinguish between compounds) when separating mixtures, which makes it a popular chromatographic technique.

The schematic of a HPLC instrument typically includes a degasser, sampler, pumps, and a detector. The sampler brings the sample mixture into the mobile phase stream which carries it into the column.  The pumps deliver the desired flow and composition of the mobile phase through the column.  The detector generates a signal proportional to the amount of sample component emerging from the column, hence allowing for [[Quantity|quantitative]] analysis of the sample components.  A digital [[microprocessor]] and user software control the HPLC instrument and provide data analysis. Some models of mechanical pumps in a HPLC instrument can mix multiple solvents together in ratios changing in time, generating a composition [[gradient]] in the mobile phase.  Various detectors are in common use, such as [[UV/Vis]], [[photodiode]] array (PDA) or based on [[mass spectrometry]].  Most HPLC instruments also have a column oven that allows for adjusting the temperature at which the separation is performed.

==Operation==

The sample mixture to be separated and analyzed is introduced, in a discrete small volume (typically microliters), into the stream of mobile phase percolating through the column. The components of the sample move through the column at different velocities, which are a function of specific physical interactions with the adsorbent (also called stationary phase). The velocity of each component depends on its chemical nature, on the nature of the stationary phase (column) and on the composition of the mobile phase. The time at which a specific analyte elutes (emerges from the column) is called its retention time. The retention time measured under particular conditions is an identifying characteristic of a given analyte.

Many  different types of columns are available, filled with adsorbents varying in particle size, and in the nature of their surface ("surface chemistry"). The use of smaller particle size packing materials requires the use of higher operational pressure ("backpressure") and typically improves chromatographic resolution (''i.e.'', the degree of separation between consecutive analytes emerging from the column). Sorbent particles may be hydrophobic or polar in nature.

Common mobile phases used include any miscible combination of [[Water (molecule)|water]] with various organic solvents (the most common are [[acetonitrile]] and [[methanol]]). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see [[#Normal-phase chromatography|Normal-phase chromatography]] below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or [[trifluoroacetic acid]]) or salts to assist in the separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant ("isocratic elution mode") or varied ("gradient elution mode") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient elution the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1–3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile.
[[File:Fraction Collector Tube Rack.jpg|thumb|A rotary fraction collector collecting HPLC output. The system is being used to isolate a fraction containing [[Complex I]] from ''E. coli'' plasma membranes. About 50 litres of bacteria were needed to isolate this amount.&lt;ref name="Fraction collector (post on Flickr)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morgan|first1=David J.|title=Fraction collector (post on Flickr)|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/tz1_1zt/112090380|website=Flickr|accessdate=28 October 2015|date=2003-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The chosen composition of the mobile phase (also called eluent) depends on the intensity of interactions between various sample components ("analytes") and stationary phase (''e.g.'', hydrophobic interactions in reversed-phase HPLC). Depending on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases analytes partition between the two during the separation process taking place in the column. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a [[liquid–liquid extraction]] but is continuous, not step-wise. In this example, using a water/acetonitrile gradient, more hydrophobic components will [[elute]] (come off the column) late, once the mobile phase gets more concentrated in acetonitrile (''i.e.'', in a mobile phase of higher eluting strength).

The choice of mobile phase components, additives (such as salts or acids) and gradient conditions depends on the nature of the column and sample components. Often a series of trial runs is performed with the sample in order to find the HPLC method which gives adequate separation.

==History and development==

Prior to HPLC scientists used standard liquid chromatographic techniques. Liquid chromatographic systems were largely inefficient due to the flow rate of [[solvents]] being dependent on gravity. Separations took many hours, and sometimes days to complete. [[Gas chromatography]] (GC) at the time was more powerful than [[liquid chromatography]] (LC), however, it was believed that gas phase separation and analysis of very polar high molecular weight [[biopolymers]] was impossible.&lt;ref name=Karger&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karger, Barry L. |year=1997|title=HPLC: Early and Recent Perspectives|journal= Journal of Chemical Education |volume=74|issue=1|pages=45|doi=10.1021/ed074p45|bibcode=1997JChEd..74...45K}}&lt;/ref&gt; GC was ineffective for many biochemists because of the thermal instability of the solutes.&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Henry, Richard A. (1 February 2009) [http://www.chromatographyonline.com/early-days-hplc-dupont "The Early Days of HPLC at Dupont"]. Chromatography Online. Avanstar Communications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, alternative methods were hypothesized which would soon result in the development of HPLC.

Following on the seminal work of Martin and Synge in 1941, it was predicted by Cal Giddings, Josef Huber, and others in the 1960s that LC could be operated in the high-efficiency mode by reducing the packing-particle diameter substantially below the typical LC (and GC) level of 150 μm and using pressure to increase the mobile phase velocity.&lt;ref name=Karger /&gt; These predictions underwent extensive experimentation and refinement throughout the 60s into the 70s. Early developmental research began to improve LC particles, and the invention of Zipax, a superficially porous particle, was promising for HPLC technology.&lt;ref&gt;Iler, R.K. (1979) ''The Chemistry of Silica''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s brought about many developments in hardware and instrumentation. Researchers began using pumps and injectors to make a rudimentary design of an HPLC system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Karger, B. L. |author2=Berry, L. V. |title=Rapid liquid-chromatographic separation of steroids on columns heavily loaded with stationary phase |journal=Clin. Chem. |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=757–64 |pmid=4254537|year=1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gas amplifier pumps were ideal because they operated at constant [[pressure]] and did not require leak free seals or check valves for steady flow and good quantitation.&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt; Hardware milestones were made at Dupont IPD (Industrial Polymers Division) such as a low-dwell-volume gradient device being utilized as well as replacing the septum injector with a loop injection valve.&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt;

While instrumentational developments were important, the history of HPLC is primarily about the history and evolution of [[particle technology]].&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt;  After the introduction of porous layer particles, there has been a steady trend to reduced particle size to improve efficiency.&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt; However, by decreasing particle size, new problems arose. The practical disadvantages stem from the excessive pressure drop needed to force mobile fluid through the column and the difficulty of preparing a uniform packing of extremely fine materials.&lt;ref&gt;Giddings, J. Calvin (1965) ''Dynamics of Chromatography, Part I. Principles and Theory''. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York. p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Every time particle size is reduced significantly, another round of instrument development usually must occur to handle the pressure.&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt;

==Types==

===Partition chromatography===
[[File:HILIC Partition Method Graphic.png|thumb|300px|[[HILIC]] Partition Technique Useful Range]]
Partition chromatography was one of the first kinds of chromatography that chemists developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 19| issue = 5| pages = 506–512| last = Ettre| first = C.| title = Milestones in Chromatography: The Birth of Partition Chromatography| journal = LCGC| accessdate = 2016-02-26| date = 2001| url = http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/pharma/2014/08/22/1598ed6f-5bbe-400b-bc08-ff07d2c59826/article-2090.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[partition coefficient]] principle has been applied in [[paper chromatography]], [[thin layer chromatography]], [[gas phase]] and [[countercurrent chromatography|liquid–liquid separation]] applications. The 1952 [[Nobel Prize]] in chemistry was earned by [[Archer John Porter Martin]] and [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]] for their development of the technique, which was used for their separation of [[amino acids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 35| issue = 1–2| pages = 91–121| last1 = Martin| first1 = A J P| last2 = Synge| first2 = R L M| title = Separation of the higher monoamino-acids by counter-current liquid-liquid extraction: the amino-acid composition of wool| journal = Biochemical Journal| date = 1941| pmid = 16747393| doi=10.1042/bj0350091| pmc=1265473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partition chromatography uses a retained solvent, on the surface or within the grains or fibers of an "inert" solid supporting matrix as with [[paper chromatography]]; or takes advantage of some [[coulombic]] and/or [[hydrogen donor]] interaction with the stationary phase. Analyte molecules partition between a liquid stationary phase and the eluent. Just as in [[HILIC|Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography]] (HILIC; a sub-technique within HPLC), this method separates analytes based on differences in their polarity. HILIC most often uses a bonded polar [[Stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]] and a mobile phase made primarily of [[acetonitrile]] with water as the strong component. Partition HPLC has been used historically on unbonded silica or alumina supports. Each works effectively for separating analytes by relative polar differences. HILIC bonded phases have the advantage of separating [[acidic]], [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] and neutral solutes in a single chromatographic run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1987 |title=High performance liquid chromatography |publisher=Wiley |author1=Lindsay, S. |author2=Kealey, D. |osti = 7013902}} from review {{cite journal|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |volume=110 |issue=11 |year=1988 |doi=10.1021/ac00162a003|title=Theoretical and experimental foundation for surface-coverage programming in gas–solid chromatography with an adsorbable carrier gas|last1=Hung|first1=L. B.|last2=Parcher|first2=J. F.|last3=Shores|first3=J. C.|last4=Ward|first4=E. H.|pages=1090–1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The polar analytes diffuse into a stationary water layer associated with the polar stationary phase and are thus retained. The stronger the interactions between the polar analyte and the polar stationary phase (relative to the mobile phase) the longer the elution time. The interaction strength depends on the functional groups part of the analyte molecular structure, with more polarized groups (''e.g.'', hydroxyl-) and groups capable of hydrogen bonding inducing more retention.   [[Coulombic]] (electrostatic) interactions can also increase retention. Use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will decrease the retention time of the analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to increase retention times.

===Normal–phase chromatography===

Normal–phase chromatography was one of the first kinds of HPLC that chemists developed. Also known as normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) this method separates analytes based on their affinity for a polar stationary surface such as silica, hence it is based on analyte ability to engage in polar interactions (such as [[hydrogen-bonding]] or [[dipole-dipole]] type of interactions) with the sorbent surface. NP-HPLC uses a non-polar, non-aqueous mobile phase (''e.g.'', [[Chloroform]]), and works effectively for separating analytes readily soluble in non-polar solvents. The analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increased analyte polarity. The interaction strength depends not only on the functional groups present in the structure of the analyte molecule, but also on [[Steric effects|steric factors]]. The effect of steric hindrance on interaction strength allows this method to resolve (separate) [[structural isomer]]s.

The use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will decrease the retention time of analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to induce slower elution (increased retention times). Very polar solvents such as traces of water in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the solid surface of the stationary phase forming a stationary bound (water) layer which is considered to play an active role in retention.  This behavior is somewhat peculiar to normal phase chromatography because it is governed almost exclusively by an adsorptive mechanism (''i.e.'', analytes interact with a solid surface rather than with the solvated layer of a ligand attached to the sorbent surface; see also reversed-phase HPLC below). Adsorption chromatography is still widely used for structural isomer separations in both column and thin-layer chromatography formats on activated (dried) silica or alumina supports.

Partition- and NP-HPLC fell out of favor in the 1970s with the development of [[reversed-phase chromatography|reversed-phase]] HPLC because of poor reproducibility of retention times due to the presence of a water or protic organic solvent layer on the surface of the silica or [[alumina]] chromatographic media. This layer changes with any changes in the composition of the mobile phase (''e.g.'', moisture level) causing drifting retention times.

Recently, partition chromatography has become popular again with the development of [[Hilic]] bonded phases which demonstrate improved reproducibility, and due to a better understanding of the range of usefulness of the technique.

===Displacement chromatography===
The basic principle of [[displacement chromatography]] is:
A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) will compete effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html Displacement Chromatography]. Sacheminc.com. Retrieved 2011-06-07. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915113736/http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html |date=September 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired in order to achieve maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentration.

===Reversed-phase chromatography (RPC)===

[[File:Hplc-perfume-chromatogram.png|thumb|300px|A chromatogram of complex mixture (perfume water) obtained by reversed phase HPLC]]

{{details|Reversed-phase chromatography}}
Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) has a non-polar stationary phase and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. One common stationary phase is a silica which has been surface-modified with RMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl, where R is a straight chain alkyl group such as C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;. With such stationary phases, retention time is longer for molecules which are less polar, while polar molecules elute more readily (early in the analysis). An investigator can increase retention times by adding more water to the mobile phase; thereby making the affinity of the hydrophobic analyte for the hydrophobic stationary phase stronger relative to the now more hydrophilic mobile phase. Similarly, an investigator can decrease retention time by adding more organic solvent to the eluent. RP-HPLC is so commonly used that it is often incorrectly referred to as "HPLC" without further specification. The pharmaceutical industry regularly employs RP-HPLC to qualify drugs before their release.

RP-HPLC operates on the principle of hydrophobic interactions, which originates from the high symmetry in the dipolar water structure and plays the most important role in all processes in life science. RP-HPLC allows the measurement of these interactive forces. The binding of the analyte to the stationary phase is proportional to the contact surface area around the non-polar segment of the analyte molecule upon association with the ligand on the stationary phase. This [[solvophobic]] effect is dominated by the force of water for "cavity-reduction" around the analyte and the C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;-chain versus the complex of both. The energy released in this process is proportional to the [[surface tension]] of the eluent (water: 7.3{{e|−6}}&amp;nbsp;[[Joules|J]]/cm², methanol: 2.2{{e|−6}}&amp;nbsp;J/cm²) and to the hydrophobic surface of the analyte and the ligand respectively. The retention can be decreased by adding a less polar solvent (methanol, [[acetonitrile]]) into the mobile phase to reduce the surface tension of water. [[Gradient elution]] uses this effect by automatically reducing the polarity and the surface tension of the aqueous mobile phase during the course of the analysis.

Structural properties of the analyte molecule play an important role in its retention characteristics. In general, an analyte with a larger hydrophobic surface area (C–H, C–C, and generally non-polar atomic bonds, such as S-S and others) is retained longer because it is non-interacting with the water structure. On the other hand, analytes with higher polar surface area (conferred by the presence of polar groups, such as -OH, -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or -NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in their structure) are less retained as they are better integrated into water. Such interactions are subject to steric effects in that very large molecules may have only restricted access to the pores of the stationary phase, where the interactions with surface ligands (alkyl chains) take place.  Such surface hindrance typically results in less retention.

Retention time increases with hydrophobic (non-polar) surface area. Branched chain compounds elute more rapidly than their corresponding linear isomers because the overall surface area is decreased. Similarly organic compounds with single C–C bonds elute later than those with a C=C or C–C triple bond, as the double or triple bond is shorter than a single C–C bond.

Aside from mobile phase surface tension (organizational strength in eluent structure), other mobile phase modifiers can affect analyte retention. For example, the addition of inorganic salts causes a moderate linear increase in the surface tension of aqueous solutions (ca. 1.5{{e|−7}}&amp;nbsp;J/cm² per Mol for NaCl, 2.5{{e|−7}}&amp;nbsp;J/cm² per Mol for (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and because the [[entropy]] of the analyte-solvent interface is controlled by surface tension, the addition of salts tend to increase the retention time. This technique is used for mild separation and recovery of proteins and protection of their biological activity in protein analysis (hydrophobic interaction chromatography, HIC).

Another important factor is the mobile phase [[pH]] since it can change the hydrophobic character of the analyte. For this reason most methods use a [[buffering agent]], such as [[sodium phosphate]], to control the pH. Buffers serve multiple purposes: control of pH, neutralize the charge on the silica surface of the stationary phase and act as ion pairing agents to neutralize analyte charge. [[Ammonium formate]] is commonly added in mass spectrometry to improve detection of certain analytes by the formation of analyte-ammonium [[adducts]]. A volatile organic acid such as [[acetic acid]], or most commonly [[formic acid]], is often added to the mobile phase if mass spectrometry is used to analyze the column effluent. [[Trifluoroacetic acid]] is used infrequently in mass spectrometry applications due to its persistence in the detector and solvent delivery system, but can be effective in improving retention of analytes such as [[carboxylic acids]] in applications utilizing other detectors, as it is a fairly strong organic acid. The effects of acids and buffers vary by application but generally improve chromatographic resolution.

Reversed phase columns are quite difficult to damage compared with normal silica columns; however, many reversed phase columns consist of alkyl derivatized silica particles and should '''never''' be used with aqueous [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] as these will destroy the underlying silica particle. They can be used with aqueous acid, but the column should not be exposed to the acid for too long, as it can corrode the metal parts of the HPLC equipment. RP-HPLC columns should be flushed with clean solvent after use to remove residual acids or buffers, and stored in an appropriate composition of solvent. The metal content of HPLC columns must be kept low if the best possible ability to separate substances is to be retained. A good test for the metal content of a column is to inject a sample which is a [[mixture]] of 2,2'- and 4,4'-[[bipyridine]]. Because the 2,2'-bipy can [[chelate]] the metal, the shape of the peak for the 2,2'-bipy will be distorted (tailed) when [[metal]] [[ion]]s are present on the surface of the [[silica]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}..

===Size-exclusion chromatography===
{{details|size-exclusion chromatography}}
Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), also known as ''gel permeation chromatography'' or ''gel filtration chromatography'', separates particles on the basis of molecular size (actually by a particle's [[Stokes radius]]). It is generally a low resolution chromatography and thus it is often reserved for the final, "polishing" step of the purification. It is also useful for determining the [[tertiary structure]] and [[quaternary structure]] of purified proteins. SEC is used primarily for the analysis of large molecules such as proteins or polymers. SEC works by trapping these smaller molecules in the pores of a particle. The larger molecules simply pass by the pores as they are too large to enter the pores. Larger molecules therefore flow through the column quicker than smaller molecules, that is, the smaller the molecule, the longer the retention time.

This technique is widely used for the molecular weight determination of polysaccharides. SEC is the official technique (suggested by European pharmacopeia) for the molecular weight comparison of different commercially available low-molecular weight [[heparin]]s.

===Ion-exchange chromatography===
{{details|Ion-exchange chromatography}}
In ion-exchange chromatography (IC), retention is based on the attraction between solute ions and charged sites bound to the stationary phase. Solute ions of the same charge as the charged sites on the column are excluded from binding, while solute ions of the opposite charge of the charged sites of the column are retained on the column. Solute ions that are retained on the column can be eluted from the column by changing the solvent conditions (''e.g.'', increasing the ion effect of the solvent system by increasing the salt concentration of the solution, increasing the column temperature, changing the pH of the solvent, etc.).

Types of ion exchangers include polystyrene resins, cellulose and [[dextran]] ion exchangers (gels), and controlled-pore glass or porous silica. Polystyrene resins allow cross linkage which increases the stability of the chain. Higher cross linkage reduces swerving, which increases the equilibration time and ultimately improves selectivity. Cellulose and dextran ion exchangers possess larger pore sizes and low charge densities making them suitable for protein separation.

In general, ion exchangers favor the binding of ions of higher charge and smaller radius.

An increase in [[counter ion]] (with respect to the functional groups in resins) concentration reduces the retention time. A decrease in pH reduces the retention time in cation exchange while an increase in pH reduces the retention time in anion exchange. By lowering the pH of the solvent in a cation exchange column, for instance, more hydrogen ions are available to compete for positions on the anionic stationary phase, thereby eluting weakly bound cations.

This form of chromatography is widely used in the following applications: water purification, preconcentration of trace components, ligand-exchange chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography of proteins, high-pH [[anion-exchange chromatography]] of carbohydrates and oligosaccharides, and others.

===Bioaffinity chromatography===
{{details|Affinity chromatography}}
This chromatographic process relies on the property of biologically active substances to form stable, specific, and reversible complexes. The formation of these complexes involves the participation of common molecular forces such as the [[Van der Waals interaction]], electrostatic interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and the hydrogen bond. An efficient, biospecific bond is formed by a simultaneous and concerted action of several of these forces in the complementary binding sites.

===Aqueous normal-phase chromatography===
Aqueous normal-phase chromatography (ANP) is a chromatographic technique which encompasses the mobile phase region between reversed-phase chromatography (RP) and organic normal phase chromatography (ONP). This technique is used to achieve unique selectivity for hydrophilic compounds, showing normal phase elution using reversed-phase solvents. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Isocratic and gradient elution==
[[File:HPLC extraction and use.jpg|thumb|At the ARS Natural Products Utilization Research Unit in Oxford, MS., a support scientist (r) extracts plant pigments that will be analyzed by a plant physiologist (l) using an HPLC system.]]
A separation in which the [[mobile phase]] composition remains constant throughout the procedure is termed ''isocratic'' (meaning ''constant composition''). (The example of these the percentage of methanol throughout the procedure will remain constant i.e 10%)  The word was coined by [[Csaba Horváth (chemical engineer)|Csaba Horvath]] who was one of the pioneers of HPLC.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}},

The mobile phase composition does not have to remain constant. A separation in which the mobile phase composition is changed during the separation process is described as a ''gradient elution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Snyder, Lloyd R.  |author2=Dolan, John W. |title = High-Performance Gradient Elution: The Practical Application of the Linear-Solvent-Strength Model|publisher = Wiley Interscience|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0470055519}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is a gradient starting at 10% [[methanol]] and ending at 90% methanol after 20 minutes. The two components of the mobile phase are typically termed "A" and "B"; ''A'' is the "weak" solvent which allows the solute to elute only slowly, while ''B'' is the "strong" solvent which rapidly elutes the solutes from the column. In [[reversed-phase chromatography]], solvent ''A'' is often water or an aqueous buffer, while ''B'' is an organic solvent miscible with water, such as [[acetonitrile]], methanol, [[Tetrahydrofuran|THF]], or [[isopropanol]].

In isocratic elution, peak width increases with retention time linearly according to the equation for N, the number of theoretical plates. This leads to the disadvantage that late-eluting peaks get very flat and broad. Their shape and width may keep them from being recognized as peaks.

Gradient elution decreases the retention of the later-eluting components so that they elute faster, giving narrower (and taller) peaks for most components. This also improves the peak shape for tailed peaks, as the increasing concentration of the organic eluent pushes the tailing part of a peak forward. This also increases the peak height (the peak looks "sharper"), which is important in trace analysis. The gradient program may include sudden "step" increases in the percentage of the organic component, or different slopes at different times – all according to the desire for optimum separation in minimum time.

In isocratic elution, the selectivity does not change if the column dimensions (length and inner diameter) change – that is, the peaks elute in the same order. In gradient elution, the elution order may change as the dimensions or flow rate change.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The driving force in reversed phase chromatography originates in the high order of the water structure. The role of the ''organic component of the mobile phase'' is to reduce this high order and thus ''reduce the retarding strength of the aqueous component.''

==Parameters==

===Theoretical===
HPLC separations have theoretical parameters and equations to describe the separation of components into signal peaks when detected by instrumentation such as by a UV detector or a mass spectrometer. The parameters are largely derived from two sets of chromatagraphic theory: plate theory (as part of [[Partition chromatography]]), and the rate theory of chromatography / ''[[Van Deemter equation]]''. Of course, they can be put in practice through analysis of HPLC chromatograms, although rate theory is considered the more accurate theory.

They are analogous to the calculation of [[retention factor]] for a [[paper chromatography]] separation, but describes how well HPLC separates a mixture into two or more components that are detected as peaks (bands) on a chromatogram. The HPLC parameters are the: efficiency factor(''N''), the retention factor (kappa prime), and the separation factor (alpha). Together the factors are variables in a resolution equation, which describes how well two components' peaks separated or overlapped each other. These parameters are mostly only used for describing HPLC reversed phase and HPLC normal phase separations, since those separations tend to be more subtle than other HPLC modes (''e.g.'', ion exchange and size exclusion).

Void volume is the amount of space in a column that is occupied by solvent. It is the space within the column that is outside of the column's internal packing material. Void volume is measured on a chromatogram as the first component peak detected, which is usually the solvent that was present in the sample mixture; ideally the sample solvent flows through the column without interacting with the column, but is still detectable as distinct from the HPLC solvent. The void volume is used as a correction factor.

Efficiency factor (''N'') practically measures how sharp component peaks on the chromatogram are, as ratio of the component peak's area ("retention time") relative to the width of the peaks at their widest point (at the baseline). Peaks that are tall, sharp, and relatively narrow indicate that separation method efficiently removed a component from a mixture; high efficiency. Efficiency is very dependent upon the HPLC column and the HPLC method used. Efficiency factor is synonymous with plate number, and the 'number of theoretical plates'.

[[Retention factor]] (''kappa prime'') measures how long a component of the mixture stuck to the column, measured by the area under the curve of its peak in a chromatogram (since HPLC chromatograms are a function of time). Each chromatogram peak will have its own retention factor (''e.g.'', ''kappa''&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt; for the retention factor of the first peak). This factor may be corrected for by the void volume of the column.

Separation factor (''alpha'') is a relative comparison on how well two neighboring components of the mixture were separated (''i.e.'', two neighboring bands on a chromatogram). This factor is defined in terms of a ratio of the retention factors of a pair of neighboring chromatogram peaks, and may also be corrected for by the void volume of the column. The greater the separation factor value is over 1.0, the better the separation, until about 2.0 beyond which an HPLC method is probably not needed for separation.
Resolution equations relate the three factors such that high efficiency and separation factors improve the resolution of component peaks in a HPLC separation.

===Internal diameter===
[[File:Nano-LC - (1).jpg|thumb|Tubing on a nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC) system, used for very low flow capacities.]]
The internal diameter (ID) of an HPLC column is an important parameter that influences the detection sensitivity and separation selectivity in gradient elution. It also determines the quantity of analyte that can be loaded onto the column. Larger columns are usually seen in industrial applications, such as the purification of a drug product for later use. Low-ID columns have improved sensitivity and lower solvent consumption at the expense of loading capacity.

Larger ID columns (over 10&amp;nbsp;mm) are used to purify usable amounts of material because of their large loading capacity.

Analytical scale columns (4.6&amp;nbsp;mm) have been the most common type of columns, though smaller columns are rapidly gaining in popularity. They are used in traditional quantitative analysis of samples and often use a [[spectrophotometer|UV-Vis absorbance detector]].

Narrow-bore columns (1–2&amp;nbsp;mm) are used for applications when more sensitivity is desired either with special UV-vis detectors, [[fluorescence]] detection or with other detection methods like [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]]

Capillary columns (under 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm) are used almost exclusively with alternative detection means such as [[mass spectrometry]]. They are usually made from [[fused silica]] capillaries, rather than the stainless steel tubing that larger columns employ.

===Particle size===
Most traditional HPLC is performed with the stationary phase attached to the outside of small spherical [[silicon dioxide|silica]] particles (very small beads). These particles come in a variety of sizes with 5&amp;nbsp;µm beads being the most common. Smaller particles generally provide more surface area and better separations, but the pressure required for optimum linear velocity increases by the inverse of the particle diameter squared.&lt;ref&gt;Majors, Ronald E.. (2010-09-07) [http://www.lcgceurope.com/lcgceurope/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=333246&amp;pageID=3# Fast and Ultrafast HPLC on sub-2 μm Porous Particles — Where Do We Go From Here? – LC-GC Europe].

This means that changing to particles that are half as big, keeping the size of the column the same, will double the performance, but increase the required pressure by a factor of four. Larger particles are used in preparative HPLC (column diameters 5&amp;nbsp;cm up to &gt;30&amp;nbsp;cm) and for non-HPLC applications such as [[solid-phase extraction]].

===Pore size===
Many stationary phases are porous to provide greater surface area. Small pores provide greater surface area while larger pore size has better kinetics, especially for larger analytes. For example, a protein which is only slightly smaller than a pore might enter the pore but does not easily leave once inside.

===Pump pressure===
[[Pump]]s vary in pressure capacity, but their performance is measured on their ability to yield a consistent and reproducible [[volumetric flow rate]]. [[Pressure]] may reach as high as 60&amp;nbsp;MPa (6000&amp;nbsp;[[Pound per square inch|lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]), or about 600&amp;nbsp;atmospheres. Modern HPLC systems have been improved to work at much higher pressures, and therefore are able to use much smaller particle sizes in the columns (&lt;2&amp;nbsp;μm). These ultra high performance liquid chromatography" systems or UHPLCs can work at up to 120&amp;nbsp;MPa (17,405&amp;nbsp;lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or about 1200&amp;nbsp;atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agilent.com/en-us/products/liquid-chromatography/lc-pumps-vacuum-degassers/1290-infinity-quaternary-pump#specifications  1290 Infinity Quaternary Pump]. Agilent&lt;/ref&gt; The term "UPLC"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waters.com/waters/en_US/Trademarks/nav.htm?cid=1000238&amp;locale=en_US|title=Trademarks : Waters|last=waters|website=www.waters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a trademark of the [[Waters Corporation]], but is sometimes used to refer to the more general technique of UHPLC.

===Detectors===
HPLC detectors fall into two main categories: universal or selective. Universal detectors typically measure a bulk property (''e.g.'', [[refractive index]]) by measuring a difference of a [[physical property]] between the mobile phase and mobile phase with solute while selective detectors measure a solute property (''e.g.'', [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|UV-Vis absorbance]]) by simply responding to the physical or [[chemical property]] of the solute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles and practice of modern chromatographic methods|last=K.|first=Robards|date=1994|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|others=Haddad, P. R., Jackson, P. E.|isbn=9780080571782|location=Amsterdam|pages=|oclc=815471219}}&lt;/ref&gt; HPLC most commonly uses a [[spectrophotometer|UV-Vis absorbance detector]], however, a wide range of other [[chromatography detector]]s can be used. A universal detector that complements UV-Vis absorbance detection is the [[Charged aerosol detector]] (CAD). A kind of commonly utilized detector includes refractive index detectors, which provide readings by measuring the changes in the refractive index of the effluent as it moves through the flow cell. In certain cases, it is possible to use multiple detectors, for example [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LCMS]] normally combines UV-Vis with a mass spectrometer.

===Autosamplers===
Large numbers of samples can be automatically injected onto an HPLC system,  by the use of HPLC autosamplers.  In addition, HPLC autosamplers have an injection volume and technique which is exactly the same for each injection, consequently they provide a high degree of injection volume precision.

== Applications ==

=== Manufacturing ===
HPLC has many applications in both laboratory and clinical science. It is a  common technique used in pharmaceutical development, as it is a dependable way to obtain and ensure product purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Practical aspects of fast reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using 3 μm particle packed columns and monolithic columns in pharmaceutical development and production working under current good manufacturing practice |last1=Gerber |first1=Frederic |date=May 2004 |journal=Journal of Chromatography |volume=1036 |issue=2 |pages=127–33 |doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2004.02.056 |pmid=15146913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While HPLC can produce extremely high quality (pure) products, it is not always the primary method used in the production of bulk drug materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Analytical techniques in pharmaceutical analysis: A review |journal=Arabian Journal of Chemistry |volume=10 |pages=S1409–S1421 |doi=10.1016/j.arabjc.2013.04.016 |first1=Masoom Raza |last1=Siddiqui |first2=Zeid A. |last2=AlOthman |first3=Nafisur |last3=Rahman|year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the European pharmacopoeia, HPLC is used in only 15.5% of syntheses.&lt;ref&gt;''The European Pharmacopoeia'', 2002. fourth ed., Council of Europe, Strasbourg.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it plays a role in 44% of syntheses in the United States pharmacopoeia.&lt;ref&gt;''United States Pharmacopoeia'', 2004. 27th ed. The USP Convention Inc., Rockville, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; This could possibly be due to differences in monetary and time constraints, as HPLC on a large scale can be an expensive technique. An increase in specificity, precision, and accuracy that occurs with HPLC unfortunately corresponds to an increase in cost.

=== Legal ===
This technique is also used for detection of illicit drugs in urine. The most common method of drug detection is an immunoassay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry versus immunoassay drug testing in pain patients|url=http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/current/pdf?article=MTM1MQ%3D%3D&amp;journal=55|journal = Pain Physician|date = 2010-06-01|pmid = 20495592|pages = 273–281|volume = 13|issue = 3|first = Amadeo|last = Pesce|first2 = Murray|last2 = Rosenthal|first3 = Robert|last3 = West|first4 = Cameron|last4 = West|first5 = Bridgit|last5 = Crews|first6 = Charles|last6 = Mikel|first7 = Perla|last7 = Almazan|first8 = Sergey|last8 = Latyshev}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is much more convenient. However, convenience comes at the cost of specificity and coverage of a wide range of drugs. As HPLC is a method of determining (and possibly increasing) purity, using HPLC alone in evaluating concentrations of drugs is somewhat insufficient. With this, HPLC in this context is often performed in conjunction with [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Screening and confirmation of 62 drugs of abuse and metabolites in urine by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry|journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology|date = 2013-12-01|pmid = 24084874|pages = 642–651|volume = 37|issue = 9|doi = 10.1093/jat/bkt083|first = I.-Lin|last = Tsai|first2 = Te-I.|last2 = Weng|first3 = Yufeng J.|last3 = Tseng|first4 = Happy Kuy-Lok|last4 = Tan|first5 = Hsiao-Ju|last5 = Sun|first6 = Ching-Hua|last6 = Kuo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using liquid chromatography instead of gas chromatography in conjunction with MS circumvents the necessity for derivitizing with acetylating or alkylation agents, which can be a burdensome extra step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Automated solid-phase extraction and two-step derivatisation for simultaneous analysis of basic illicit drugs in serum by GC/MS|journal = International Journal of Legal Medicine|date = 2000-01-01|pmid = 10929239|pages = 229–235|volume = 113|issue = 4|first = W.|last = Weinmann|first2 = M.|last2 = Renz|first3 = S.|last3 = Vogt|first4 = S.|last4 = Pollak|doi=10.1007/s004149900098}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has been used to detect a variety of agents like doping agents, drug metabolites, glucuronide conjugates, amphetamines, opioids, cocaine, BZDs, ketamine, LSD, cannabis, and pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A general screening method for doping agents in human urine by solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry|journal = Analytica Chimica Acta|date = 2007-02-28|pmid = 17386652|pages = 94–102|volume = 585|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.aca.2006.12.028|first = Marjo|last = Kolmonen|first2 = Antti|last2 = Leinonen|first3 = Anna|last3 = Pelander|first4 = Ilkka|last4 = Ojanperä}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toxicological screening with formula-based metabolite identification by liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry|journal = Analytical Chemistry|date = 2003-11-01|pmid = 14588010|pages = 5710–5718|volume = 75|issue = 21|doi = 10.1021/ac030162o|first = Anna|last = Pelander|first2 = Ilkka|last2 = Ojanperä|first3 = Suvi|last3 = Laks|first4 = Ilpo|last4 = Rasanen|first5 = Erkki|last5 = Vuori}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performing HPLC in conjunction with [[Mass spectrometry]] reduces the absolute need for standardizing HPLC experimental runs.

=== Research ===
Similar assays can be performed for research purposes, detecting concentrations of potential clinical candidates like anti-fungal and asthma drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Metabolic profiling of a potential antifungal drug, 3-(4-bromophenyl)-5-acetoxymethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-one, in mouse urine using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV photodiode-array and mass spectrometric detection|journal = Journal of Chromatography B|date = 2007-06-15|pmid = 17400036|pages = 10–19|volume = 853|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1016/j.jchromb.2007.02.045|first = Milan|last = Nobilis|first2 = Milan|last2 = Pour|first3 = Petr|last3 = Senel|first4 = Jan|last4 = Pavlík|first5 = Jirí|last5 = Kunes|first6 = Marie|last6 = Voprsalová|first7 = Lenka|last7 = Kolárová|first8 = Michal|last8 = Holcapek}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is obviously useful in observing multiple species in collected samples, as well, but requires the use of standard solutions when information about species identity is sought out. It is used as a method to confirm results of synthesis reactions, as purity is essential in this type of research. However, mass spectrometry is still the more reliable way to identify species.

=== Medical ===
Medical use of HPLC can include drug analysis, but falls more closely under the category of nutrient analysis. While urine is the most common medium for analyzing drug concentrations, blood serum is the sample collected for most medical analyses with HPLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A high-sensitivity ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR-TOFMS) method for screening synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs of abuse in urine|journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|date = 2013-10-01|pmid = 23954996|pages = 8463–8474|volume = 405|issue = 26|doi = 10.1007/s00216-013-7272-8|first = Mira|last = Sundström|first2 = Anna|last2 = Pelander|first3 = Verena|last3 = Angerer|first4 = Melanie|last4 = Hutter|first5 = Stefan|last5 = Kneisel|first6 = Ilkka|last6 = Ojanperä}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods of detection of molecules that are useful for clinical studies have been tested against HPLC, namely immunoassays. In one example of this, competitive protein binding assays (CPBA) and HPLC were compared for sensitivity in detection of vitamin D. Useful for diagnosing vitamin D deficiencies in children, it was found that sensitivity and specificity of this CPBA reached only 40% and 60%, respectively, of the capacity of HPLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Competitive Protein-binding assay-based Enzyme-immunoassay Method, Compared to High-pressure Liquid Chromatography, Has a Very Lower Diagnostic Value to Detect Vitamin D Deficiency in 9–12 Years Children|journal = International Journal of Preventive Medicine|date = 2015-01-01|pmc = 4542329|pmid = 26330983|page = 67|volume = 6|doi = 10.4103/2008-7802.161069|first = Maliheh|last = Zahedi Rad|first2 = Tirang Reza|last2 = Neyestani|first3 = Bahareh|last3 = Nikooyeh|first4 = Nastaran|last4 = Shariatzadeh|first5 = Ali|last5 = Kalayi|first6 = Niloufar|last6 = Khalaji|first7 = Azam|last7 = Gharavi}}&lt;/ref&gt; While an expensive tool, the accuracy of HPLC is nearly unparalleled.

'''''Hubble''''' (also known as '''''Hubble 3D''''', '''''IMAX: Hubble''''', or '''''IMAX: Hubble 3D''''') is a 2010 American [[documentary film]] about [[Space Shuttle]] missions to repair and upgrade the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. It is narrated by the actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].

==Content==
{{advertisement|section|date=July 2016}}
"Through the power of [[IMAX 3D]], ''Hubble 3D'' will enable movie-goers to journey through distant galaxies to explore the grandeur and mysteries of our celestial surroundings, and accompany space-walking [[astronauts]] as they attempt the most difficult and important tasks in NASA’s history. The film offers an inspiring and unique look into the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) legacy and highlight its profound impact on the way we view the universe and ourselves. ''Hubble 3D'' is an IMAX and Warner Bros. Pictures production, in cooperation with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The film reunites the ''[[Space Station 3D]]'' film making team, led by producer/director [[Toni Myers]]. ''Hubble 3D'' blasted off exclusively to IMAX and IMAX 3D theaters on March 19, 2010."

The film's itinerary takes the viewer past [[Magnetosphere of Saturn|Saturn's aurora]], the [[Helix Nebula]] in the [[Aquarius (constellation)|constellation of Aquarius]], the "[[Pillars of Creation]]" in the [[Eagle Nebula]], the [[Andromeda galaxy]], and the beautiful [[NGC 6302|Butterfly Nebula]]. The HST has provided data and imagery so detailed that scientists and film technicians have been able to put viewers "inside" the images during two extended [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] fly-throughs. In the most awesome sequence, gaseous clouds billow while million-mile-an-hour stellar winds blow through a cloud canyon in the [[Orion Nebula]] some 90 trillion miles across. These data-driven animations were created by the Office of Public Outreach at the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Advanced Visualization Laboratory at the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]].

==Filming==
Footage seen within the movie was compiled from multiple sources, including IMAX cameras taken into space on Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions by the Space Shuttle. This allowed the camera to shoot footage of the satellite close-up and during maintenance. IMAX cameras were taken to the Hubble Space Telescope on [[STS-61]] (Servicing Mission 1 in December 1993) and most recently on [[STS-125]] (Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009) which carried an IMAX 3D camera. The IMAX 3D camera contained a mile of film, though this allowed for only 8 minutes 30 seconds of footage to be recorded.

==Critical reception==
The film has received positive reviews. Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 86% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 37 reviews, giving the film a 'Fresh' rating. The site's consensus reads "Offering a stunning, expansive viewing experience, ''Hubble 3D'' takes advantage of IMAX and 3-D technology like no other film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' critic [[Neil Genzlinger]] largely concurred, but added "... such ponderous, cliché-heavy narration. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers it, which might lead you to expect something moderately hip; instead it’s that same old leaden drone, which back when space flight was new perhaps conveyed suitable awe but these days just makes you feel as if you’re in a junior-high civics class."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Universe Up There |last=Genzlinger |first=Neil |date=March 18, 2010 |work=The New York Times |url=https://nyti.ms/2yCyWiD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte''''' (''Research Reports in Nuclear Physics'') was an internal publication of the German ''[[German nuclear energy project|Uranverein]]'', which was initiated under the ''[[Heereswaffenamt]]'' (Army Ordnance Office) in 1939; in 1942, supervision of the ''Uranverein'' was turned over to the [[Reichsforschungsrat]] under the [[Reichserziehungsministerium]].  Reports in this publication were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies.  The reports were confiscated under the Allied [[Operation Alsos]] and sent to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] for evaluation.  In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. Many of the reports are available at the [[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center]] and the [[Niels Bohr]] Library of the [[American Institute of Physics]]. Many of them are reprinted and transcribed in the book 
"''Collected Works / Gesammelte Werke''" listed below which is available in most libraries. There are reports numbered G-1 to G-395.&lt;ref&gt;Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix E and Appendix B; see the entries for ''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte'' and ''Heereswaffenamt'', respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 1993, 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent German scientists who published reports in ''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte'' as members of the ''Uranverein''&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 1993, 268-274 and Reference #40 on p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; can be grouped as follows:

*Nine of the ten German nuclear physicists, except for [[Max von Laue]], incarcerated in England at the close of [[World War II]] under [[Operation Epsilon]]: [[Erich Bagge]], [[Kurt Diebner]], [[Walther Gerlach]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Paul Harteck]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Horst Korsching]], [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], and [[Karl Wirtz]].
*German physicists sent to [[Russia]] to work on the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]: [[Robert Döpel]], [[Walter Herrmann (physicist)|Walter Herrmann]], [[Heinz Pose]], [[Nikolaus Riehl]], and [[Karl Zimmer]].
*Others: [[Friedrich Bopp|Fritz Bopp]], [[Walther Bothe]], [[Wolfgang Finkelnburg]], [[Siegfried Flügge]], [[Hans Geiger]], [[Karl-Heinz Höcker]], [[Fritz Houtermans]], [[Georg Joos]], [[Horst Korsching]], [[Carl Ramsauer]], [[Fritz Sauter]], and [[Fritz Strassmann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20496">A number of notable [[Software package (installation)|software packages]] were developed for, or are maintained by, the [[Free Software Foundation]] as part of the [[GNU Project]].

==What it means to be a GNU package==
Summarising the situation in 2013, Richard Stallman identified nine aspects which generally apply to being a GNU package,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2013-04/msg00109.html |title=Re: On the subject of Git, Bazaar, and the future of Emacs development |date=April 3, 2013 |mailinglist=emacs-devel |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman  |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he noted that exceptions and flexibility are possible when there are good reasons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2013-04/msg00163.html |title=Re: On the subject of Git, Bazaar, and the future of Emacs development |date=April 3, 2013 |mailinglist=emacs-devel |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman  |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- this list is adapted from RMS's mail (msg00109 link above) --&gt;
# The package should say that it is a GNU package.
# It should be distributed via ftp.gnu.org, or another site offering access to everyone.
# The package's homepage should be on the GNU website.
# The developers must pay attention to making their software work well with other GNU packages.
# Documentation should be in [[Texinfo]] format, or in a format easily convertible to Texinfo.
# Should use [[GNU Guile]] for its extension language, but exceptions are explicitly possible in this regard.
# Should not recommend any non-free program, nor refer the user to any non-free documentation or non-free software.
# Use GNU terminology, including referring to "[[Linux naming controversy|GNU/Linux]] systems" in many situations where other observers would just write "Linux", and "free software" rather than "open source".
# The maintainer should be contactable, at least infrequently, to discuss problems in the software or fixing compatibility issues.
&lt;!-- this list is adapted from RMS's mail (msg00109 link above) --&gt;

==Base system==
There is no official "base system" of the [[GNU operating system]].  GNU was designed to be a replacement for Unix operating systems of the 1980s and used the [[POSIX]] standards as a guide, but either definition would give a much larger "base system".  The following list is instead a small set of GNU packages which seem closer to being "core" packages than being in any of the further down sections.  Inclusions (such as [[plotutils]]) and exclusions (such as the [[C standard library]]) are of course debatable.

'''Luminiferous aether''' or '''ether'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Scholar "luminiferous ether" |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q={{urlencode:"luminiferous ether"}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Books "luminiferous ether" |url=https://www.google.com/search?q={{urlencode:"luminiferous ether"}}&amp;tbm=bks}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("luminiferous", meaning "light-bearing"), was the postulated [[Transmission medium|medium]] for the propagation of [[light]].&lt;ref&gt;The 19th century science book ''[[A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar]]'' provides a brief summary of scientific thinking in this field at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; It was invoked to explain the ability of the apparently [[wave]]-based light to propagate through empty space, something that waves should not be able to do. The assumption of a spatial plenum of luminiferous aether, rather than a spatial vacuum, provided the theoretical medium that was required by wave theories of light.

The aether hypothesis was the topic of considerable debate throughout its history, as it required the existence of an invisible and infinite material with no interaction with physical objects. As the nature of light was explored, especially in the 19th century, the physical qualities required of an aether became increasingly contradictory. By the late 1800s, the existence of the aether was being questioned, although there was no physical theory to replace it.

The negative outcome of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] (1887) suggested that the aether did not exist, a finding that was confirmed in subsequent experiments through the 1920s. This led to considerable theoretical work to explain the propagation of light without an aether. A major breakthrough was the [[theory of relativity]], which could explain why the experiment failed to see aether, but was more broadly interpreted to suggest that it was not needed. The Michelson-Morley experiment, along with the [[blackbody radiator]] and [[photoelectric effect]], was a key experiment in the development of [[modern physics]], which includes both relativity and [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], the latter of which explains the wave-like nature of light.

==The history of light and aether==
{{See also|Timeline of luminiferous aether}}

===Particles vs. waves===
{{main|Wave-particle duality}}
In the 17th century, [[Robert Boyle]] was a proponent of an aether hypothesis. According to Boyle, the aether consists of subtle particles, one sort of which explains the absence of vacuum and the mechanical interactions between bodies, and the other sort of which explains phenomena such as magnetism (and possibly gravity) that are, otherwise, inexplicable on the basis of purely mechanical interactions of macroscopic bodies, "though in the ether of the ancients there was nothing taken notice of but a diffused and very subtle substance; yet we are at present content to allow that there is always in the air a swarm of steams moving in a determinate course between the north pole and the south".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Boyle, ''The Works of the Honourable Robert Boyle'', ed. Thomas Birch, 2nd edn., 6 vols. (London, 1772), III, 316; quoted in E.A. Burtt, ''The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1954), 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christiaan Huygens]] hypothesized that light is a wave propagating through an aether. He and [[Isaac Newton]] could only envision light waves as being [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]], propagating like sound and other [[mechanical wave]]s in [[fluid]]s. However, longitudinal waves necessarily have only one form for a given propagation direction, rather than two [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]s like [[transverse wave]]. Thus, longitudinal waves can not explain [[birefringence]], in which two polarizations of light are refracted differently by a crystal. In addition, Newton rejected light as waves in a medium because such a medium would have to extend everywhere in space, and would thereby "disturb and retard the Motions of those great Bodies" (the planets and comets) and thus "as it {{bracket|light's medium}} is of no use, and hinders the Operation of Nature, and makes her languish, so there is no evidence for its Existence, and therefore it ought to be rejected".{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Isaac Newton contended that light is made up of numerous small particles. This can explain such features as light's ability to travel in straight lines and [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] off surfaces. Newton imagined that light particles as non-spherical "corpuscles", with different "sides" that give rise to birefringence. But the particle theory of light can not satisfactorily explain [[refraction]] and [[diffraction]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} To explain refraction, Newton's ''[[Opticks]]'' (1704) postulated an "Aethereal Medium" transmitting vibrations faster than light, by which light, when overtaken, is put into "Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission", which caused refraction and diffraction. Newton believed that these vibrations were related to heat radiation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is not the Heat of the warm Room convey'd through the vacuum by the Vibrations of a much subtiler Medium than Air, which after the Air was drawn out remained in the Vacuum?  And is not this Medium the same with that Medium by which Light is refracted and reflected, and by whose Vibrations Light communicates Heat to Bodies, and is put into Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission?&lt;ref group=A name=newton /&gt;{{rp|349}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to the modern understanding that heat radiation and light are both [[electromagnetic radiation]], Newton viewed heat and light as two different phenomena. He believed heat vibrations to be excited "when a Ray of Light falls upon the Surface of any pellucid Body".&lt;ref group=A name=newton /&gt;{{rp|348}} He wrote, "I do not know what this Aether is", but that if it consists of particles then they must be &lt;blockquote&gt;exceedingly smaller than those of Air, or even than those of Light: The exceeding smallness of its Particles may contribute to the greatness of the force by which those Particles may recede from one another, and thereby make that Medium exceedingly more rare and elastic than Air, and by consequence exceedingly less able to resist the motions of Projectiles, and exceedingly more able to press upon gross Bodies, by endeavoring to expand itself.&lt;ref group=A name=newton /&gt;{{rp|352}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bradley suggests particles===
In 1720, [[James Bradley]] carried out a series of experiments attempting to measure [[stellar parallax]] by taking measurements of stars at different times of the year. As the Earth moves around the sun, the apparent angle to a given distant spot changes. By measuring those angles the distance to the star can be calculated based on the known orbital circumference of the Earth around the sun. He failed to detect any parallax, thereby placing a lower limit on the distance to stars.

During these experiments, Bradley also discovered a related effect; the apparent positions of the stars did change over the year, but not as expected. Instead of the apparent angle being maximized when the Earth was at either end of its orbit with respect to the star, the angle was maximized when the Earth was at its fastest sideways velocity with respect to the star. This effect is now known as [[stellar aberration]].

Bradley explained this effect in the context of Newton's corpuscular theory of light, by showing that the aberration angle was given by simple vector addition of the Earth's orbital velocity and the velocity of the corpuscles of light, just as  vertically falling raindrops strike a moving object at an angle. Knowing the Earth's velocity and the aberration angle, this enabled him to estimate the speed of light.

Explaining stellar aberration in the context of an aether-based theory of light was regarded as more problematic. As the aberration relied on relative velocities, and the measured velocity was dependent on the motion of the Earth, the aether had to be remaining stationary with respect to the star as the Earth moved through it. This meant that the Earth could travel through the aether, a physical medium, with no apparent effect – precisely the problem that led Newton to reject a wave model in the first place.

===Waves theory triumphs===
A century later, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] revived the wave theory of light when they pointed out that light could be a [[transverse wave]] rather than a longitudinal wave – the polarization of a transverse wave (like Newton's "sides" of light) could explain birefringence, and in the wake of a series of experiments on diffraction the particle model of Newton was finally abandoned. [[Physics|Physicists]] assumed, moreover, that like mechanical waves, light waves required a medium for [[Wave propagation|propagation]], and thus required Huygens's idea of an aether "gas" permeating all space.

However, a transverse wave apparently required the propagating medium to behave as a solid, as opposed to a gas or fluid. The idea of a solid that did not interact with other matter seemed a bit odd, and [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] suggested that perhaps there was some sort of "dragging", or "entrainment", but this made the aberration measurements difficult to understand. He also suggested that the ''absence'' of longitudinal waves suggested that the aether had negative compressibility. [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]] pointed out that such a fluid would be unstable. [[George Gabriel Stokes]] became a champion of the entrainment interpretation, developing a model in which the aether might be (by analogy with pine pitch) rigid at very high frequencies and fluid at lower speeds. Thus the Earth could move through it fairly freely, but it would be rigid enough to support light.

===Electromagnetism===
In 1856, [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]] measured the numerical value of the ratio of the electromagnetic unit of charge to the electrostatic unit of charge. They found that the ratio equals the product of the speed of light and the square root of two. The following year, [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] wrote a paper in which he showed that the speed of a signal along an electric wire was equal to the speed of light. These are the first recorded historical links between the speed of light and electromagnetic phenomena.

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] began working on [[Michael Faraday]]'s [[lines of force]]. In his 1861 paper ''[[:Image:On Physical Lines of Force.pdf|On Physical Lines of Force]]'' he modelled these magnetic lines of force using a sea of molecular vortices that he considered to be partly made of aether and partly made of ordinary matter. He derived expressions for the dielectric constant and the magnetic permeability in terms of the transverse elasticity and the density of this elastic medium. He then equated the ratio of the dielectric constant to the magnetic permeability with a suitably adapted version of Weber and Kohlrausch's result of 1856, and he substituted this result into Newton's equation for the speed of sound. On obtaining a value that was close to the speed of light as measured by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]], Maxwell concluded that light consists in undulations of the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.&lt;ref group=B name=whitt /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=janb /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=darrigol /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=schaffner /&gt;

Maxwell had, however, expressed some uncertainties surrounding the precise nature of his molecular vortices and so he began to embark on a purely dynamical approach to the problem. He wrote another paper in 1864, entitled "[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]", in which the details of the luminiferous medium were less explicit.&lt;ref group=A name=maxb /&gt; Although Maxwell did not explicitly mention the sea of molecular vortices, his derivation of [[Ampère's circuital law]] was carried over from the 1861 paper and he used a dynamical approach involving rotational motion within the electromagnetic field which he likened to the action of flywheels. Using this approach to justify the electromotive force equation (the precursor of the [[Lorentz force]] equation), he derived a wave equation from a set of eight equations which appeared in the paper and which included the electromotive force equation and [[Ampère's circuital law]].&lt;ref group=A name=maxb /&gt; Maxwell once again used the experimental results of Weber and Kohlrausch to show that this wave equation represented an electromagnetic wave that propagates at the speed of light, hence supporting the view that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.

The apparent need for a propagation medium for such [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz|Hertzian waves]] can be seen by the fact that they consist of orthogonal electric (E) and magnetic (B or H) waves. The E waves consist of undulating dipolar electric fields, and all such dipoles appeared to require separated and opposite electric charges. Electric charge is an inextricable property of [[matter]], so it appeared that some form of matter was required to provide the alternating current that would seem to have to exist at any point along the propagation path of the wave. Propagation of waves in a true vacuum would imply the existence of [[electric field]]s without associated [[electric charge]], or of electric charge without associated matter. Albeit compatible with Maxwell's equations, [[electromagnetic induction]] of electric fields could not be demonstrated in vacuum, because all methods of detecting electric fields required electrically charged matter.

In addition, Maxwell's equations required that all electromagnetic waves in [[vacuum]] propagate at a fixed speed, ''[[speed of light|c]]''. As this can only occur in one [[frame of reference|reference frame]] in Newtonian physics (see [[Galilean invariance|Galilean-Newtonian relativity]]), the aether was hypothesized as the absolute and unique frame of reference in which Maxwell's equations hold. That is, the aether must be "still" universally, otherwise ''c'' would vary along with any variations that might occur in its supportive medium. Maxwell himself proposed several mechanical models of aether based on wheels and gears, and [[George Francis FitzGerald]] even constructed a working model of one of them. These models had to agree with the fact that the electromagnetic waves are [[transverse wave|transverse]] but never [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]].

===Problems===
By this point the mechanical qualities of the aether had become more and more magical: it had to be a [[fluid]] in order to fill space, but one that was millions of times more rigid than steel in order to support the high frequencies of light waves. It also had to be massless and without [[viscosity]], otherwise it would visibly affect the orbits of planets. Additionally it appeared it had to be completely transparent, non-dispersive, [[incompressible fluid|incompressible]], and continuous at a very small scale.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for these properties|date=January 2017}} Maxwell wrote in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'':&lt;ref group=A name=maxa /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aethers were invented for the planets to swim in, to constitute electric atmospheres and magnetic effluvia, to convey sensations from one part of our bodies to another, and so on, until all space had been filled three or four times over with aethers. ... The only aether which has survived is that which was invented by Huygens to explain the propagation of light.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary scientists were aware of the problems, but aether theory was so entrenched in physical law by this point that it was simply assumed to exist. In 1908 [[Oliver Lodge]] gave a speech on behalf of [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keelynet.com/osborn/rey7.htm|title=Rayleigh &amp; Lodge on the Ether of Space - Keelynet - 06/26/00|author=|date=|website=www.keelynet.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913035152/http://www.keelynet.com/osborn/rey7.htm|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Royal Institution]] on this topic, in which he outlined its physical properties, and then attempted to offer reasons why they were not impossible. Nevertheless, he was also aware of the criticisms, and quoted [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] as saying that "aether is little more than a nominative case of the verb ''to undulate''". Others criticized it as an "English invention", although Rayleigh jokingly stated it was actually an invention of the Royal Institution.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Lodge, [http://www.keelynet.com/osborn/rey7.htm "The Ether of Space"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830024731/http://www.keelynet.com/osborn/rey7.htm |date=2005-08-30 }}, address to the Royal Institution, 21 February 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, aether theory was in trouble. A series of [[#Negative aether-drift experiments|increasingly complex experiments]] had been carried out in the late 19th century to try to detect the motion of the Earth through the aether, and had failed to do so. A range of proposed aether-dragging theories could explain the null result but these were more complex, and tended to use arbitrary-looking coefficients and physical assumptions. Lorentz and FitzGerald offered within the framework of [[Lorentz ether theory]] a more elegant solution to how the motion of an absolute aether could be undetectable (length contraction), but if their equations were correct, the new [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) could generate the same mathematics without referring to an aether at all. Aether fell to [[Occam's Razor]].&lt;ref group=B name=whitt /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=janb /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=darrigol /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=schaffner /&gt;

==Relative motion between the Earth and aether==

===Aether drag===
{{Main|Aether drag hypothesis}}
The two most important models, which were aimed to describe the relative motion of the Earth and aether, were [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s (1818) model of the (nearly) stationary aether including a partial aether drag determined by Fresnel's dragging coefficient,&lt;ref group=A name=fresnel /&gt;
and [[George Gabriel Stokes]]' (1844)&lt;ref group=A name=stokes /&gt;
model of complete aether drag. The latter theory was not considered as correct, since it was not compatible with the [[aberration of light]], and the auxiliary hypotheses developed to explain this problem were not convincing. Also, subsequent experiments as the [[Sagnac effect]] (1913) also showed that this model is untenable. However, the most important experiment supporting Fresnel's theory was [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Fizeau]]'s 1851 experimental confirmation of [[Fresnel]]'s 1818 prediction that a medium with [[refractive index]] ''n'' moving with a velocity ''v'' would increase the speed of light travelling through the medium in the same direction as ''v'' from ''c''/''n'' to:&lt;ref group=E name=Fizeau1 /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=michel2 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{n} + \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n^2} \right) v.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, movement adds only a fraction of the medium's velocity to the light (predicted by Fresnel in order to make [[Snell's law]] work in all frames of reference, consistent with stellar aberration).  This was initially interpreted to mean that the medium drags the aether along, with a ''portion'' of the medium's velocity, but that understanding became very problematic after [[Wilhelm Veltmann]] demonstrated that the index ''n'' in Fresnel's formula depended upon the [[wavelength]] of light, so that the aether could not be moving at a wavelength-independent speed. This implied that there must be a separate aether for each of the infinitely many frequencies.

===Negative aether-drift experiments===
The key difficulty with Fresnel's aether hypothesis arose from the juxtaposition of the two well-established theories of Newtonian dynamics and Maxwell's electromagnetism. Under a [[Galilean transformation]] the equations of Newtonian dynamics are  [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]], whereas those of electromagnetism are not. Basically this means that while physics should remain the same in non-accelerated experiments, light would not follow the same rules because it is travelling in the universal "aether frame". Some effect caused by this difference should be detectable.

A simple example concerns the model on which aether was originally built: sound. The speed of propagation for mechanical waves, the [[speed of sound]], is defined by the mechanical properties of the medium. Sound travels 4.3 times faster in water than in air.  This explains why a person hearing an explosion underwater and quickly surfacing can hear it again as the slower travelling sound arrives through the air.  Similarly, a traveller on an [[airliner]] can still carry on a conversation with another traveller because the sound of words is travelling along with the air inside the aircraft. This effect is basic to all Newtonian dynamics, which says that everything from sound to the trajectory of a thrown baseball should all remain the same in the aircraft flying (at least at a constant speed) as if still sitting on the ground. This is the basis of the Galilean transformation, and the concept of frame of reference.

But the same was not supposed to be true for light, since Maxwell's mathematics demanded a single universal speed for the propagation of light, based, not on local conditions, but on two measured properties, the [[permittivity]] and [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of free space, that were assumed to be the same throughout the universe. If these numbers did change, there should be noticeable effects in the sky; stars in different directions would have different colours, for instance.{{Verify source|date=June 2011}}

Thus at any point there should be one special coordinate system, "at rest relative to the aether". Maxwell noted in the late 1870s that detecting motion relative to this aether should be easy enough—light travelling along with the motion of the Earth would have a different speed than light travelling backward, as they would both be moving against the unmoving aether. Even if the aether had an overall universal flow, changes in position during the day/night cycle, or over the span of seasons, should allow the drift to be detected.

====First order experiments====
Although the aether is almost stationary according to Fresnel, his theory predicts a positive outcome of aether drift experiments only to ''second'' order in &lt;math&gt;v/c&lt;/math&gt;, because Fresnel's dragging coefficient would cause a negative outcome of all optical experiments capable of measuring effects to ''first'' order in &lt;math&gt;v/c&lt;/math&gt;. This was confirmed by the following first-order experiments, which all gave negative results. The following list is based on the description of [[Wilhelm Wien]] (1898), with changes and additional experiments according to the descriptions of [[Edmund Taylor Whittaker]] (1910) and [[Jakob Laub]] (1910):&lt;ref group=B name=wien /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=whitt /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=laub /&gt;

* The experiment of [[François Arago]] (1810), to confirm whether refraction, and thus the aberration of light, is influenced by Earth's motion. Similar experiments were conducted by [[George Biddell Airy]] (1871) by means of a telescope filled with water, and [[Éleuthère Mascart]] (1872).&lt;ref group=E name=Arago /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=Airy /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=masc1 /&gt;
* The experiment of Fizeau (1860), to find whether the rotation of the polarization plane through glass columns is changed by Earth's motion. He obtained a positive result, but Lorentz could show that the results have been contradictory. [[DeWitt Bristol Brace]] (1905) and Strasser (1907) repeated the experiment with improved accuracy, and obtained negative results.&lt;ref group=E name=Fizeau2 /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=Brace2 /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=Strasser /&gt;
* The experiment of [[Martin Hoek]] (1868). This experiment is a more precise variation of the [[Fizeau experiment|Fizeau experiment (1851)]]. Two light rays were sent in opposite directions – one of them traverses a path filled with resting water, the other one follows a path through air. In agreement with Fresnel's dragging coefficient, he obtained a negative result.&lt;ref group=E name=Hoek /&gt;
* The experiment of [[Wilhelm Klinkerfues]] (1870) investigated whether an influence of Earth's motion on the absorption line of sodium exists. He obtained a positive result, but this was shown to be an experimental error, because a repetition of the experiment by [[Hermanus Haga|Haga]] (1901) gave a negative result.&lt;ref group=E name=Klinkerfues /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=Haga /&gt;
* The experiment of Ketteler (1872), in which two rays of an interferometer were sent in opposite directions through two mutually inclined tubes filled with water. No change of the interference fringes occurred. Later, Mascart (1872) showed that the interference fringes of polarized light in calcite remained uninfluenced as well.&lt;ref group=E name=Ketteler /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=masc2 /&gt;
* The experiment of [[Éleuthère Mascart]] (1872) to find a change of rotation of the polarization plane in quartz. No change of rotation was found when the light rays had the direction of Earth's motion and then the opposite direction. [[Lord Rayleigh]] conducted similar experiments with improved accuracy, and obtained a negative result as well.&lt;ref group=E name=masc1 /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=masc2 /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=Rayleigh1 /&gt;

Besides those optical experiments, also electrodynamic first-order experiments were conducted, which should have led to positive results according to Fresnel. However, [[Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]] (1895) modified Fresnel's theory and showed that those experiments can be explained by a stationary aether as well:&lt;ref group=A name=lorb /&gt;

* The experiment of [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] (1888), to find whether a charged condenser produces magnetic forces due to Earth's motion.&lt;ref group=E name=Roentgen /&gt;
* The experiment of [[Theodor des Coudres]] (1889), to find whether the inductive effect of two wire rolls upon a third one is influenced by the direction of Earth's motion. Lorentz showed that this effect is cancelled to first order by the electrostatic charge (produced by Earth's motion) upon the conductors.&lt;ref group=E name=Coudres /&gt;
* The experiment of Königsberger (1905). The plates of a condenser are located in the field of a strong electromagnet. Due to Earth's motion, the plates should have become charged. No such effect was observed.&lt;ref group=E name=Koenigsberger /&gt;
* The experiment of [[Frederick Thomas Trouton]] (1902). A condenser was brought parallel to Earth's motion, and it was assumed that momentum is produced when the condenser is charged. The negative result can be explained by Lorentz's theory, according to which the electromagnetic momentum compensates the momentum due to Earth's motion. Lorentz could also show, that the sensitivity of the apparatus was much too low to observe such an effect.&lt;ref group=E name=Trouton1 /&gt;

====Second order experiments====
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment conducted with white light.png|right|thumb|The Michelson–Morley experiment compared the time for light to reflect from mirrors in two orthogonal directions.]]
While the ''first''-order experiments could be explained by a modified stationary aether, more precise ''second''-order experiments were expected to give positive results, however, no such results could be found.

The famous [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] compared the source light with itself after being sent in different directions, looking for changes in phase in a manner that could be measured with extremely high accuracy. In this experiment, their goal was to determine the velocity of the Earth through the aether.&lt;ref group=E name=michel1 /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=michel3 /&gt; The publication of their result in 1887, the [[null result]], was the first clear demonstration that something was seriously wrong with the aether hypothesis (Michelson's first experiment in 1881 was not entirely conclusive). In this case the MM experiment yielded a shift of the fringing pattern of about 0.01 of a [[Fringe shift|fringe]], corresponding to a small velocity. However, it was incompatible with the expected aether wind effect due to the Earth's (seasonally varying) velocity which would have required a shift of 0.4 of a fringe, and the error was small enough that the value may have indeed been zero.  Therefore, the [[null hypothesis]], the hypothesis that there was no aether wind, could not be rejected.  More modern experiments have since reduced the possible value to a number very close to zero, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−17&lt;/sup&gt;.

A series of experiments using similar but increasingly sophisticated apparatuses all returned the null result as well. Conceptually different experiments that also attempted to detect the motion of the aether were the [[Trouton–Noble experiment]]&amp;nbsp;(1903),&lt;ref group=E name=Trouton2 /&gt; whose objective was to detect [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] effects caused by electrostatic fields, and [[Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace|the experiments of Rayleigh and Brace]] (1902, 1904),&lt;ref group=E name=Rayleigh2 /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=Brace1 /&gt; to detect [[double refraction]] in various media. However, all of them obtained a null result, like Michelson–Morley (MM) previously did.

These "aether-wind" experiments led to a flurry of efforts to "save" aether by assigning to it ever more complex properties, while only few scientists, like [[Emil Cohn]] or [[Alfred Bucherer]], considered the possibility of the abandonment of the aether hypothesis. Of particular interest was the possibility of "aether entrainment" or "aether drag", which would lower the magnitude of the measurement, perhaps enough to explain the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment. However, as noted earlier, aether dragging already had problems of its own, notably aberration. In addition, the interference experiments of [[Oliver Lodge|Lodge]] (1893, 1897) and [[Ludwig Zehnder]] (1895), aimed to show whether the aether is dragged by various, rotating masses, showed no aether drag.&lt;ref group=E name=Lodge /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=Lodge2 /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=Zehnder /&gt; A more precise measurement was made in the [[Hammar experiment]] (1935), which ran a complete MM experiment with one of the "legs" placed between two massive lead blocks.&lt;ref group=E name=Hammar /&gt; If the aether was dragged by mass then this experiment would have been able to detect the drag caused by the lead, but again the null result was achieved. The theory was again modified, this time to suggest that the entrainment only worked for very large masses or those masses with large magnetic fields. This too was shown to be incorrect by the [[Michelson–Gale–Pearson experiment]], which detected the Sagnac effect due to Earth's rotation (see [[Aether drag hypothesis]]).

Another, completely different attempt to save "absolute" aether was made in the [[Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction hypothesis]], which posited that ''everything'' was affected by travel through the aether. In this theory the reason the Michelson–Morley experiment "failed" was that the apparatus contracted in length in the direction of travel. That is, the light was being affected in the "natural" manner by its travel though the aether as predicted, but so was the apparatus itself, cancelling out any difference when measured. FitzGerald had inferred this hypothesis from a paper by [[Oliver Heaviside]]. Without referral to an aether, this physical interpretation of relativistic effects was [[Kennedy–Thorndike experiment|shared by Kennedy and Thorndike]] in 1932 as they concluded that the interferometer's arm contracts and also the frequency of its light source "very nearly" varies in the way required by relativity.&lt;ref group=E name=kenn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;They commented in a footnote: "From [the Michelson–Morley] experiment it is not inferred that the velocity of the earth is but a few kilometers per second, but rather that the dimensions of the apparatus vary very nearly as required by relativity. From the present experiment we similarly infer that the frequency of light varies conformably to the theory."&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly the [[Sagnac effect]], observed by G. Sagnac in 1913, was immediately seen to be fully consistent with special relativity.&lt;ref group=E name=Sagnac1 /&gt;&lt;ref group=E name=Sagnac2 /&gt; In fact, the [[Michelson-Gale-Pearson experiment]] in 1925 was proposed specifically as a test to confirm the relativity theory, although it was also recognized that such tests, which merely measure absolute rotation, are also consistent with non-relativistic theories.&lt;ref&gt;The confusion over this point can be seen in Sagnac's conclusion that "in the ambient space, light is propagated with a velocity V0, independent of the movement as a whole of the luminous source O and the optical system. That is a property of space which experimentally characterizes the luminiferous aether." The invariance of light speed, independent of the movement of the source, is also one of the two fundamental principles of special relativity.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, the experiments pioneered by Michelson were repeated by [[Dayton Miller]], who publicly proclaimed positive results on several occasions, although they were not large enough to be consistent with any known aether theory. However, other researchers were unable to duplicate Miller's claimed results. Over the years the experimental accuracy of such measurements has been raised by many orders of magnitude, and no trace of any violations of Lorentz invariance has been seen. (A later re-analysis of Miller's results concluded that he had underestimated the variations due to temperature.)

Since the Miller experiment and its unclear results there have been many more experimental attempts to detect the aether. Many experimenters have claimed positive results. These results have not gained much attention from mainstream science, since they contradict a large quantity of high-precision measurements, all the results of which were consistent with special relativity.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Schleif (2006); Physics FAQ: [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/experiments.html#Experiments_not_consistent_with_SS Experiments that Apparently are NOT Consistent with SR/GR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015153529/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/experiments.html |date=2009-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lorentz aether theory==
{{Main|Lorentz ether theory}}
Between 1892 and 1904, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] developed an electron-aether theory, in which he introduced a strict separation between matter (electrons) and aether. In his model the aether is completely motionless, and won't be set in motion in the neighborhood of ponderable matter. Contrary to earlier electron models, the electromagnetic field of the aether appears as a mediator between the electrons, and changes in this field cannot propagate faster than the speed of light. A fundamental concept of Lorentz's theory in 1895 was the "theorem of corresponding states" for terms of order v/c.&lt;ref group=A name=lorb /&gt; This theorem states that an observer moving relative to the aether makes the same observations as a resting observer, after a suitable change of variables. Lorentz noticed that it was necessary to change the space-time variables when changing frames and introduced concepts like physical [[length contraction]] (1892)&lt;ref group=A name=lora /&gt; to explain the Michelson–Morley experiment, and the mathematical concept of [[Relativity of simultaneity|local time]] (1895) to explain the [[aberration of light]] and the [[Fizeau experiment]]. This resulted in the formulation of the so-called [[Lorentz transformation]] by [[Joseph Larmor]] (1897, 1900)&lt;ref group=A name=lara /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=larb /&gt; and Lorentz (1899, 1904),&lt;ref group=A name=lorc /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=lord /&gt; whereby (it was noted by Larmor) the complete formulation of local time is accompanied by some sort of [[time dilation]] of electrons moving in the aether. As Lorentz later noted (1921, 1928), he considered the time indicated by clocks resting in the aether as "true" time, while local time was seen by him as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical artifice.&lt;ref group=A name=lore /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=lorf /&gt; Therefore, Lorentz's theorem is seen by modern authors as being a mathematical transformation from a "real" system resting in the aether into a "fictitious" system in motion.&lt;ref group=B name=miller /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=darrigol /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=jana /&gt;

The work of Lorentz was mathematically perfected by [[Henri Poincaré]], who formulated on many occasions the [[Principle of Relativity]] and tried to harmonize it with electrodynamics. He declared simultaneity only a convenient convention which depends on the speed of light, whereby the constancy of the speed of light would be a useful [[postulate]] for making the laws of nature as simple as possible. In 1900 and 1904&lt;ref group=A name=poinca /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=poincb /&gt; he physically interpreted Lorentz's local time as the result of clock synchronization by light signals. In June and July 1905&lt;ref group=A name=poincc /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=poincd /&gt; he declared the relativity principle a general law of nature, including gravitation. He corrected some mistakes of Lorentz and proved the Lorentz covariance of the electromagnetic equations. However, he used the notion of an aether as a perfectly undetectable medium and distinguished between apparent and real time, so most historians of science argue that he failed to invent special relativity.&lt;ref group=B name=miller /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=pais /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=darrigol /&gt;

==End of aether==

===Special relativity===
Aether theory was dealt another blow when the Galilean transformation and Newtonian dynamics were both modified by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], giving the mathematics of [[Lorentz ether theory|Lorentzian electrodynamics]] a new, "non-aether" context.&lt;ref group=A name=einselektro /&gt; Unlike most major shifts in scientific thought, special relativity was adopted by the scientific community remarkably quickly, consistent with Einstein's later comment that the laws of physics described by the Special Theory were "ripe for discovery" in 1905.&lt;ref group=B name=born /&gt; Max Planck's early advocacy of the special theory, along with the elegant formulation given to it by [[Hermann Minkowski]], contributed much to the rapid acceptance of special relativity among working scientists.

Einstein based his theory on Lorentz's earlier work. Instead of suggesting that the mechanical properties of objects changed with their constant-velocity motion through an undetectable aether, Einstein proposed to deduce the characteristics that any successful theory must possess in order to be consistent with the most basic and firmly established principles, independent of the existence of a hypothetical aether. He found that the Lorentz transformation must transcend its connection with Maxwell's equations, and must represent the fundamental relations between the space and time coordinates of [[inertial frame of reference|inertial frames of reference]]. In this way he demonstrated that the laws of physics remained invariant as they had with the Galilean transformation, but that light was now invariant as well.

With the development of the special theory of relativity, the need to account for a single universal [[frame of reference]] had disappeared – and acceptance of the 19th century theory of a luminiferous aether disappeared with it. For Einstein, the Lorentz transformation implied a conceptual change: that the concept of position in space or time was not absolute, but could differ depending on the observer's location and velocity.

Moreover, in another paper published the same month in 1905, Einstein made several observations on a then-thorny problem, the [[photoelectric effect]]. In this work he demonstrated that light can be considered as particles that have a "wave-like nature". Particles obviously do not need a medium to travel, and thus, neither did light. This was the first step that would lead to the full development of [[quantum mechanics]], in which the wave-like nature ''and'' the particle-like nature of light are both considered as valid descriptions of light. A summary of Einstein's thinking about the aether hypothesis, relativity and light quanta may be found in his 1909 (originally German) lecture "The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation".&lt;ref group=A name=einsdev /&gt;

Lorentz on his side continued to use the aether hypothesis. In his lectures of around 1911 he pointed out that what "the theory of relativity has to say ... can be carried out independently of what one thinks of the aether and the time". He commented that "whether there is an aether or not, electromagnetic fields certainly exist, and so also does the energy of the electrical oscillations" so that, "if we do not like the name of 'aether', we must use another word as a peg to hang all these things upon". He concluded that "one cannot deny the bearer of these concepts a certain substantiality".&lt;ref&gt;Lorentz wrote: "One cannot deny to the bearer of these properties a certain substantiality, and if so, then one may, in all modesty, call true time the time measured by clocks which are fixed in this medium, and consider simultaneity as a primary concept." However, he went on to say that this was based on his conception of "infinite velocity", which according to his own theory is not physically realizable. Lorentz also admitted that the postulate of an absolute but undetectable rest frame was purely metaphysical, and had no empirical consequences.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=miller /&gt;

=== Other models ===
{{Main|Aether theories}}
In later years there have been a few individuals who advocated a neo-Lorentzian approach to physics, which is Lorentzian in the sense of positing an absolute true state of rest that is undetectable and which plays no role in the predictions of the theory. (No violations of [[Lorentz covariance]] have ever been detected, despite strenuous efforts.) Hence these theories resemble the 19th century aether theories in name only. For example, the founder of quantum field theory, [[Paul Dirac]], stated in 1951 in an article in Nature, titled "Is there an Aether?" that "we are rather forced to have an aether".&lt;ref&gt;Dirac wrote about his theory: "We have now the velocity at all points of space-time, playing a fundamental part in electrodynamics. It is natural to regard it as the velocity of some real physical thing. Thus with the new theory of electrodynamics we are rather forced to have an aether."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=dirac /&gt; However, Dirac never formulated a complete theory, and so his speculations found no acceptance by the scientific community.

===Einstein's views on the aether===
When Einstein was still a student in the Zurich Polytechnic in 1900, he was very interested in the idea of aether. His initial proposal of research thesis was to do an experiment to measure how fast the Earth was moving through the aether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einstein: His life and Universe|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2007|isbn=|location=New York|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The velocity of a wave is proportional to the square root of the elastic forces which cause [its] propagation, and inversely proportional to the mass of the aether moved by these forces."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein's 'First' Paper (1894 or 1895), http://www.straco.ch/papers/Einstein%20First%20Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, after Einstein completed his foundational work on [[general relativity]], Lorentz wrote a letter to him in which he speculated that within general relativity the aether was re-introduced. In his response Einstein wrote that one can actually speak about a "new aether", but one may not speak of motion in relation to that aether. This was further elaborated by Einstein in some semi-popular articles (1918, 1920, 1924, 1930).&lt;ref group="A" name="einsta" /&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="einstb" /&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="einstc" /&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="einstd" /&gt;&lt;ref group="B" name="kosta" /&gt;&lt;ref group="B" name="stach" /&gt;&lt;ref group="B" name="kostb" /&gt;

In 1918 Einstein publicly alluded to that new definition for the first time.&lt;ref group=A name=einsta /&gt; Then, in the early 1920s, in a lecture which he was invited to give at Lorentz's university in Leiden, Einstein sought to reconcile the theory of relativity with [[Lorentz ether theory|Lorentzian aether]]. In this lecture Einstein stressed that special relativity took away the last mechanical property of the aether: immobility. However, he continued that special relativity does not necessarily rule out the aether, because the latter can be used to give physical reality to acceleration and rotation. This concept was fully elaborated within [[general relativity]], in which physical properties (which are partially determined by matter) are attributed to space, but no substance or state of motion can be attributed to that "aether" (by which he meant curved space-time).&lt;ref group=B name=kostb /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=einstb /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einstein 1920: ''We may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an aether. According to the general theory of relativity space without aether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But this aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In another paper of 1924, named "Concerning the Aether", Einstein argued that Newton's absolute space, in which acceleration is absolute, is the "Aether of Mechanics". And within the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell and Lorentz one can speak of the "Aether of Electrodynamics", in which the aether possesses an absolute state of motion. As regards special relativity, also in this theory acceleration is absolute as in Newton's mechanics. However, the difference from the electromagnetic aether of Maxwell and Lorentz lies in the fact, that "because it was no longer possible to speak, in any absolute sense, of simultaneous states at different locations in the aether, the aether became, as it were, four dimensional, since there was no objective way of ordering its states by time alone". Now the "aether of special relativity" is still "absolute", because matter is affected by the properties of the aether, but the aether is not affected by the presence of matter. This asymmetry was solved within general relativity. Einstein explained that the "aether of general relativity" is not absolute, because matter is influenced by the aether, just as matter influences the structure of the aether.&lt;ref group=A name=einstc /&gt;

The only similarity of this relativistic aether concept with the [[Aether (classical element)|classical aether]] models lies in the presence of physical properties in space, which can be identified through [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]]. As historians such as [[John Stachel]] argue, Einstein's views on the "new aether" are not in conflict with his abandonment of the aether in 1905. As Einstein himself pointed out, no "substance" and no state of motion can be attributed to that new aether. Einstein's use of the word "aether" found little support in the scientific community, and played no role in the continuing development of modern physics.&lt;ref group=B name=kosta /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=stach /&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=kostb /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17443">'''Metropolitan Area Projects Plan''' ('''MAPS''') is a multi-year, municipal capital improvement program, consisting of a number of projects, originally conceived in the 1990s in [[Oklahoma City]] by its then mayor [[Ron Norick]]. A MAPS program features several interrelated and defined capital projects, funded by a temporary sales tax (allowing projects to be paid for in cash, without incurring debt), administered by a separate dedicated city staff funded by the sales tax, and supervised by a volunteer citizens oversight committee.

In some ways, a MAPS program is similar to a [[Local option sales tax]].  However, taxes collected by a MAPS program do not go to a city's general fund, but are instead deposited into a trust dedicated to the specific projects identified in the taxes' enabling ordinance.  Additionally, MAPS programs are only indirectly controlled by a city's elected governance body; a citizens oversight committee provides direct oversight, which is also established by the enabling ordinance.

==Features of a MAPS program==
The key features of the original program were designed to provide accountability to the citizens of the community as well as provide a funding mechanism for capital projects without using a city's general revenue funds, and included:
* Several capital projects, each designed to appeal to a variety of demographic groups within the city, while at the same time having "those projects geographically close to each other to create a synergy of activity for people."&lt;ref name=Norick&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.okgazette.com/oklahoma/article-4194-former-mayor-ron-norick-discusses-how-current-maps-proposal-differs-from-first.html|title=Former Mayor Ron Norick discusses how current MAPS proposal differs from first|author=Scott Cooper|date=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The overall program would be funded by a dedicated, multi-year sales tax with a start date and end date
* Projects would be paid for in cash, without incurring debt; with this "pay as you go" approach, construction does not start until the cost of the project has been collected; money is in an interest bearing bank account and not deposited in the city's general fund.
* The Program would be overseen by a volunteer citizens advisory committee, whose recommendations for architects, plans and construction documents, contractors, and change-orders would be forwarded to city council for approval   
* Projects would be administered by a separate and dedicated city staff, hired specifically for the term of the program, with salaries and expenses a component of program costs, paid from sales tax revenue   
* Each project would be allocated an endowment sufficient to operate and maintain the building without additional cost to the city's general fund

A common challenge of "pay as you go" programs such as MAPS is that, because the lead-up time while accumulating the needed funds can be lengthy, specific projects of the program "are often are scuttled when administrations change and new leaders want their own signature projects... Oklahoma City was able to avoid this pitfall ‹because the city› changes mayors, but not strategies."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.placemakingchicago.com/places/oklahoma-city.asp | title=Placemaking Chicago: Oklahoma City | author=Evan Severs | date=April 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Because the voters approved a multi-year temporary sales tax that was dedicated to multiple specific projects that together had significant public support, and because the infrastructure to support the program and its projects was also temporary with dedicated funding from the sales tax, a change in elected officials has not been sufficient to change the scope of the program.

A key to success is the feature of multiple projects; while each project taken individually might not have sufficient support for individual funding, when taken as a group, the package has sufficient support for funding.  Said another way, it is important to "bundle projects to enhance community buy-in."&lt;ref name=lessons&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/123404971/MAPS-Oklahoma-City-Metropolitan-Area-Projects | title=Lessons Learned: Community &amp; Economic Development Case Studies | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago | author=Les Le | date=2003-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another benefit of multiple projects is that by staging the projects, citizens may have their confidence level increased by being shown staggered "early results ‹with less expensive projects› ... by experiencing a string of groundbreakings."&lt;ref name=lessons /&gt;

==History==
In many ways the [[early 1980s recession]] in the United States began in Oklahoma City with the collapse of the [[Penn Square Bank]].  This subsequent collapse of the state's energy business and failure of additional financial institutions, lead to a significant out-migration and excess capacity in real estate.  The resulting lack of infrastructure investment in the inner city proved to be a factor in the city's inability to attract new business.&lt;ref name=renewal&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brownfieldrenewal.com/renewal-award-project-economic_impact-city_of_oklahoma_city___metropolitan_area_projects-1.html | title=The Renewal Rewards: Economic Impact - City of Oklahoma City - Metropolitan Area Projects | publisher=Redevelopment and Renewal Magazine |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1990s some Oklahoma City interests were concerned about what they perceived as civic decline. In 1992, after the city lost a contract to house a new maintenance facility for [[United Airlines]] to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] because the airline considered Indianapolis to have a better [[standard of living]] and [[quality of life]], then-mayor [[Ron Norick]] and the [[Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce]] proposed MAPS as a measure to improve the city's economy and attractiveness as a tourist destination.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lnbBNr5ZzwUC&amp;pg=PT234&amp;dq=%22metropolitan+area+projects+plan%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22metropolitan%20area%20projects%20plan%22&amp;f=false|title=Civic revolutionaries: igniting the passion for change in America's communities|author1=Douglas C. Henton |author2=John Melville |author3=Kimberly Walesh  |last-author-amp=yes |date=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|ISBN=978-0-7879-6393-4|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City residents were initially skeptical over funding the public projects through a sales tax increase, and as late as a month before the tax [[referendum]] opposed the plan by a 20% margin.  However, the plan did pass by a slim margin in a vote in December, 1993.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;  During the five year tax period the city raised nearly $310 million in direct taxes, plus $52 million of income on the tax money it had deposited.  The tax was extended with voter approval for an additional six months to raise enough money to complete all of the projects, and construction continued until 2004.

Encouraged by the success of MAPS, city leaders proposed and adopted "MAPS for Kids", a public school improvement program.  In December 2009 the city approved a third program, "[[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3|MAPS 3]]", which would build $777 million in further improvements paid for by a similar sales tax increase.

==Oklahoma City MAPS initiative==
The MAPS initiatives in Oklahoma City, to date, consist of three major programs: The original MAPS program, MAPS for Kids, and MAPS 3.

===MAPS===
The original '''Metropolitan Area Projects Plan''', or '''[http://www.okc.gov/maps MAPS]''', was a $350 million [[public works]] and [[redevelopment]] project in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] during the middle to late 1990s, funded by a temporary, five year, voter-approved [[sales tax]] increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.okcchamber.com/index.php?submenu=ChamberHistory&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=ChamberHistory&amp;category=About|title=Chamber History}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The various MAPS projects were believed to be capable of improving the economy and attractiveness of this ‹downtown› core and having a profound impact on proximal areas;"&lt;ref name=renewal /&gt; the common theme of the projects was downtown redevelopment.  The original MAPS program comprised nine projects that took 10 years to complete, and were chosen to appeal to a wide variety of city residents and also revitalize the city's downtown: 
*renovations to the [[Civic Center Music Hall]] including the 2,500 seat Thelma Gaylord Performing Arts Theater, the 290 seat Freedie Little Theater, the 100 seat City Space Theater, the 5,000 sf Minders Hall of Mirrors, and the 3,100 sf Joel Levine Rehearsal Hall.  
*renovations to [[Cox Convention Center|The Myriad (now the Cox Convention Center)]] including a 100,000 sf expansion of the convention space. The Cox center also includes a 15,000 seat multi-purpose arena that was home to the [[Oklahoma City Barons]] hockey team (the top farm team of the [[Edmonton Oilers]]). 
*renovations to the [[Oklahoma State Fairgrounds]] 
*construction of the [[Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark]] home of the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]], the Triple-A affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] Major League Baseball team. The park has seating for up to 13,066 fans and currently utilizes a seating capacity of 9,000 for Dodgers games. 
*construction of the 18,203 seat Ford Center (now called the [[Chesapeake Energy Arena]]), an indoor multipurpose sports arena.  The arena was completed for several years before it became an important aspect of plans in 2006 through 2008 by local businessman [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who lead the purchase of the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], and later moved the basketball team to Oklahoma City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/basketball/278203_okcity20.html|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|title=Oklahoma City is positively giddy:'Looks like we might be getting y'all's team'|author=Mike Lewis|date=2006-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NBA team is now called the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]].
*construction of the "[[Bricktown (Oklahoma City)|Bricktown]] Canal" which provided a core investment to transform a former [[warehouse district]] into an entertainment district; with "recreation activities available in Bricktown are currently ‹2009› estimated to draw 2.9 million visits annually"&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greateroklahomacity.com/clientuploads/pdf/MAPS_Impact_Study_Executive_Summary.pdf | title=Executive Summary: Impact Analysis of Oklahoma City's MAPS and other Significant Central City Investments, Revised |author1=Larkin Warner  |author2=Eric Long  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher=Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce | date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}
*construction of a [[riverfront]] and recreational dams on the [[North Canadian River]] (this section of the river has been renamed the Oklahoma River, its lower section is known as the [http://boathousedistrict.org Boathouse District], the headquarters for [[USACK|USA Canoe/Kayak]] and a training center for [[USRowing]])
*a new Library/learning Center, later called the [http://www.Mls.lib.ok.us/Mls/mls_library/dn.htm Ronald J. Norick Downtown Library], a four-story main library to replace a facility that had been built in 1951
*development of the [[Oklahoma Spirit Trolleys]], a [[tourist trolley|trolley-replica bus]] network

===MAPS for Kids===
The second MAPS program, called [http://www.okc.gov/ocmaps MAPS for Kids], was a $700 million initiative to improve schools in the various school districts whose boundaries coincided with the City of Oklahoma City.  Oklahoma has school districts whose boundaries have nothing to do with the boundaries of any other political subdivision.  At the time the original MAPS tax was expiring, the [[Oklahoma City Public Schools]] system was struggling with little political capital.  "They could not pass bond issues, and the school buildings were falling apart as a result."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://americaninfrastructuremag.com/summer-2012-24.php | title=Oklahoma City Invests in New Urban Infrastructure | author=Mick Cornett | publisher=American Infrastructure,  Peninsula Publishing, Inc. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142117/http://americaninfrastructuremag.com/summer-2012-24.php | archivedate=2014-07-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then mayor [[Kirk Humphreys]] proposed a second MAPS program to repair more than 100 area schools.  With the addition of a $180-million bond issue and an eye on addressing childhood obesity issues, new gymnasiums were added to all of the Oklahoma City District's elementary schools. The program was approved by voters in 2001. This temporary sales tax was collected for seven years, with 70 percent disbursed to the Oklahoma City School District and 30 percent to 23 Suburban School Districts.

===MAPS 3===
{{main|Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3}}
[http://www.okc.gov/maps3 MAPS 3] is a $777 million program, approved by voters in 2009 with 54% of the vote (the same percentage as the Original MAPS.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/maps3 | title=MAPS 3 Oklahoma City | publisher=NewsOK.com | accessdate=27 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The one-cent sales tax initiative began in April 2010 and ends in December 2017.  After a year of public meetings organized by Mayor [[Mick Cornett]], there developed a consensus that a future MAPS program should focus on projects that improved the [[Quality of Life]] in Oklahoma City.  Hundreds of citizens suggested projects to be considered; through a series of public meetings eight projects were eventually selected to be included in the MAPS 3 proposal.
*New Downtown Convention Center
*New Downtown Public Park - 70 acres, including festival areas
*New Modern Streetcar/Transit system and an inter-modal transit hub
*New Senior Health and Wellness Centers; multiple structures in various parts of the city designed to encourage healthy lifestyles and serve as a gathering place for active seniors
*Improvements to the Oklahoma River including a whitewater training facility and various upgrades to the world-class rowing racecourse
*Improvements to the Oklahoma State Fair Grounds including replacing public event buildings
*Expansion of Trails system that interconnects the city's major parks for walking and biking 
*Expansion of neighborhood sidewalks to create a more walkable community
Recognizing that the city's economy may fluctuate during the time of the sales tax collection, and that there may be unforeseen project contingencies, the program also has a significant Infrastructure/Contingency component.

The public forum process used to identify projects to be included in the MAPS 3 program established enough public political support to overcome an effort by a newly elected city council person who attempted to derail the original MAPS 3 proposal. An initiative petition was filed that would have eliminated the Convention Center and ended the Sales tax earlier.  This council person also ran for Mayor, with MAPS being a major factor in the election. Mayor Cornett was re-elected for an unprecedented 4th term with 65.7% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-citys-mick-cornett-wins-fourth-term-as-mayor/article/3940020 | title=Oklahoma City's Mick Cornett wins fourth term as mayor | publisher=Daily Oklahoman | date=4 Mar 2014 | author=William Crum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of MAPS in Oklahoma City===
The MAPS programs have had significant impact in Oklahoma City, both economically and from a quality of life standpoint. In the 20 years since its inception "nearly $5 billion in economic impact can be attributed to the original MAPS program. This represents a nearly 10-fold return on the city's original investment." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://www.greateroklahomacity.com/clientuploads/pdf/economic%20forecast%202014.pdf | title=2014 Greater Oklahoma City Economic Forecast |author1=Russell Evans |author2=Eric Long | date=2014 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As was recently reported in a Wichita newspaper, 
"From quirky festivals and dozens of restaurants to outdoor recreation and romantic riverboat rides, a revitalized downtown Oklahoma City boasts so many attractions it is quickly becoming a favorite weekend destination for Oklahomans and Kansans alike." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | url=http://www.kansas.com/2014/05/17/3461812/okc-offers-more-activities-than.html#storylink=cpy | author =Andi Atwatwer | title=OKC offers More Activities than you'd Think | date=2014-05-17 | publisher=The Wichita Eagle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is arguable that in terms of associated investment, hotels segment represent the largest impact of the original MAPS.   "In 1992-93 when the city's leaders developed the plans for the MAPS investments, there was only one significant hotel operating in downtown Oklahoma City. What is now the Sheraton had nearly 400 rooms but was in need of upgrading. By 2008, there were seven significant hotels in the Downtown CBD and Bricktown with a total of about 1,600 rooms."&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;{{rp|15}}

The '''National Bureau of Classification''' ('''NBC'''), previously the '''Film Censor Board of Maldives''', is a government office founded on 21 May 1956 with the objective of presenting and promoting [[Film industry|cinema]] and theatrical performances for the benefit of the Maldivian people.

==History and overview==
The Government of [[Maldives]] first formed a Film Censor Board on 21 May 1956 under the President’s Office. This Board was formed with the objective of presenting and promoting cinema and theatrical performances for the benefit of the Maldivian people.
On 15 May 1983 the Film Censor Board was transferred under the mandate of the Ministry of Home Affairs and Housing. The mission of the five-member Board was to check films and theatrical dramas to see if they had issues that conflicted:

1. The tenets of Islam.
2. The Constitution, Laws and Regulations of the Maldives.
3. The Maldivian Culture.

On 1 April 1998 the Film Censor Board became a [[subsidiary]] of the Ministry of Information, Arts and Culture and on 29 December 2005, the Film Censor Board was re-branded as the National Bureau of Classification, NBC. This change was brought as the government believed that classification and education was the key to manage and regulate different content so as to protect values of artistic productions and safeguard consumer interests at the same time. Presently, the National Bureau of Classification is under the Ministry of Youth and Sports.

==Film ratings==
Classification Certificates issued by NBC are based on the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Classification Ratings |publisher=National Bureau of Classification |location=Maldives |url=http://nbc.gov.mv/services/classification-ratings |accessdate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220024616/http://www.nbc.gov.mv/services/classification-ratings |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolae Frolov''' (1876&amp;ndash;1948) was a [[Romania]]n geologist and agronomist from [[Bessarabia]]. He was noted for his work in explicating the hydrology of Bessarabia and as director of the Chișinău National Museum.

Born in [[Corneşti, Ungheni|Corneşti]], [[Raionul Ungheni|Ungheni]], Bessarabia, he graduated from Chișinău Theological Seminary and then went to Estonia where in 1904 he graduated from the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]] (now Tartu). After which he taught at the universities of [[Saint Petersburg State University|St, Petersburg]], [[Kiev University|Kiev]] and [[Odessa University|Odessa]].  In 1921, he moved to [[Chişinău]] and was appointed as director of the Chișinău Museum. He taught agronmy and agricultural economics at the university there until 1940, when he retired and moved to Romania.  He died in [[Iaşi]].

=== Definitions ===

A '''partial order''' is a [[binary relation]] "≤" over  a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''P'' which is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], and [[transitive relation|transitive]], i.e., for all ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in ''P'', we have that:

*''a ≤ a'' (reflexivity);
*if ''a ≤ b'' and ''b ≤ a'' then ''a'' = ''b'' (antisymmetry);
*if ''a ≤ b'' and ''b ≤ c'' then ''a ≤ c'' (transitivity).

In other words, a partial order is an antisymmetric [[preorder]].

A set with a partial order is called a '''partially ordered set''' (also called a '''poset'''). The term ''ordered set'' is sometimes also used for posets, as long as it is clear from the context that no other kinds of orders are meant. In particular, totally ordered sets can also be referred to as "ordered sets", especially in areas where these structures are more common than posets.

For ''a, b'' distinct elements of a partially ordered set ''P'', if ''a ≤ b'' or ''b ≤ a'', then ''a'' and ''b'' are '''comparable'''. Otherwise they are '''incomparable'''. If every two elements of a poset are comparable, the poset is called a [[totally ordered set]] or '''chain''' (e.g. the natural numbers under order). A poset in which every two elements are incomparable is called an [[antichain]].

=== Examples ===

Standard examples of posets arising in mathematics include:

* The [[real number]]s ordered by the standard ''less-than-or-equal'' relation ≤ (a totally ordered set as well).
* The set of [[subset]]s of a given set (its [[power set]]) ordered by [[subset|inclusion]]
* The set of subspaces of a [[vector space]] ordered by inclusion.
* For a partially ordered set ''P'', the [[sequence space]] containing all [[sequence]]s of elements from ''P'', where sequence ''a'' precedes sequence ''b'' if every item in ''a'' precedes the corresponding item in ''b''. Formally, {{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''∈ℕ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''∈ℕ&lt;/sub&gt;}} if and only if {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for all ''n'' in ℕ.
* For a set ''X'' and a partially ordered set ''P'', the [[function space]] containing all functions from ''X'' to ''P'', where ''f'' ≤ ''g'' if and only if ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''g''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''.
* The vertex set of a [[directed acyclic graph]] ordered by [[reachability]].
* The set of [[natural numbers]] equipped with the relation of [[divisibility]].

=== Extrema ===

There are several notions of "greatest" and "least" element in a poset ''P'', notably:

* [[Greatest element]] and least element: An element ''g'' in ''P'' is a greatest element if for every element ''a'' in ''P'', ''a''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''g''. An element ''m'' in ''P'' is a least element if for every element ''a'' in ''P'', ''a''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''m''. A poset can only have one greatest or least element.
* [[Maximal element]]s and minimal elements: An element ''g'' in P is a maximal element if there is no element ''a'' in ''P'' such that ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''g''. Similarly, an element ''m'' in ''P'' is a minimal element if there is no element ''a'' in P such that ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''m''. If a poset has a greatest element, it must be the unique maximal element, but otherwise there can be more than one maximal element, and similarly for least elements and minimal elements.
* [[Upper and lower bounds]]: For a subset ''A'' of ''P'', an element ''x'' in ''P'' is an upper bound of ''A'' if ''a''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x'', for each element ''a'' in ''A''. In particular, ''x'' need not be in ''A'' to be an upper bound of ''A''. Similarly, an element ''x'' in ''P'' is a lower bound of ''A'' if ''a''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''x'', for each element ''a'' in ''A''. A greatest element of ''P'' is an upper bound of ''P'' itself, and a least element is a lower bound of ''P''.

For example, consider the natural numbers, ordered by divisibility: 1 is a least element, as it divides all other elements, but this set does not have a greatest element nor does it have any maximal elements: any ''g'' divides 2''g'', so 2''g'' is greater than ''g'' and ''g'' cannot be maximal. If instead we consider only the natural numbers that are greater than 1, then the resulting poset does not have a least element, but any [[prime number]] is a minimal element. In this poset, 60 is an upper bound (though not the least upper bound) of {2,3,5} and 2 is a lower bound of {4,6,8,12}.

=== Additional structure ===

In many such cases, the poset has additional structure: For example, the poset can be a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] or a [[ordered semigroup|partially ordered algebraic structure]].

====Lattices====
{{Main|Lattice (order)}}
A [[Partially ordered set|poset]] (''L'', ≤) is a '''lattice''' if it satisfies the following two axioms.

;Existence of binary joins:
: For any two elements ''a'' and ''b'' of ''L'', the set {''a, b''} has a '''[[Join (mathematics)|join]]''': &lt;math&gt;a \lor b&lt;/math&gt; (also known as the least upper bound, or the supremum).
;Existence of binary meets:
: For any two elements ''a'' and ''b'' of ''L'', the set {''a, b''} has a '''[[meet (mathematics)|meet]]''': &lt;math&gt;a \land b&lt;/math&gt; (also known as the greatest lower bound, or the infimum).

The join and meet of ''a'' and ''b'' are denoted by &lt;math&gt;a \lor b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \land b&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  This definition makes &lt;math&gt; \lor &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt; [[binary operation]]s. The first axiom says that ''L'' is a [[join-semilattice]]; the second says that ''L'' is a [[meet-semilattice]]. Both operations are monotone with respect to the order: ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; implies that a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt; \lor &lt;/math&gt; b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lor &lt;/math&gt; b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

It follows by an [[mathematical induction|induction]] argument that every non-empty finite subset of a lattice has a join (supremum) and a meet (infimum). With additional assumptions, further conclusions may be possible; ''see'' [[Completeness (order theory)]] for more discussion of this subject.

A '''bounded lattice''' has a [[greatest element|greatest]] (or maximum) and [[least element|least]] (or minimum) element, denoted 1 and 0 by convention (also called '''top''' and '''bottom'''). Any lattice can be converted into a bounded lattice by adding a greatest and least element, and every non-empty finite lattice is bounded, by taking the join (resp., meet) of all elements, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\bigvee A=a_1\lor\cdots\lor a_n&lt;/math&gt; (resp.&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge A=a_1\land\cdots\land a_n&lt;/math&gt;) where &lt;math&gt;A=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

A poset is a bounded lattice if and only if every finite set of elements (including the empty set) has a join and a meet. Here, the join of an empty set of elements is defined to be the least element  &lt;math&gt;\bigvee\varnothing=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the meet of the empty set is defined to be the greatest element &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge\varnothing=1&lt;/math&gt;. This convention is consistent with the associativity and commutativity of meet and join: the join of a union of finite sets is equal to the join of the joins of the sets, and dually, the meet of a union of finite sets is equal to the meet of the meets of the sets, i.e., for finite subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of a poset ''L'',

:&lt;math&gt;\bigvee \left( A \cup B \right)= \left( \bigvee A \right) \vee \left( \bigvee B \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge \left( A \cup B \right)= \left(\bigwedge A \right) \wedge \left( \bigwedge B \right)&lt;/math&gt;

hold. Taking ''B'' to be the empty set,

:&lt;math&gt;\bigvee \left( A \cup \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigvee A \right) \vee \left( \bigvee \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigvee A \right) \vee 0
= \bigvee A&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge \left( A \cup \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigwedge A \right) \wedge \left( \bigwedge \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigwedge A \right) \wedge 1
= \bigwedge A&lt;/math&gt;

which is consistent with the fact that &lt;math&gt;A \cup \emptyset = A&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[algebra]], an ''ordered semigroup'' is a [[semigroup]] (''S'',•) together with a [[partial order]] ≤ that is ''compatible'' with the semigroup operation, meaning that ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies z•x ≤ z•y and x•z ≤ y•z for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''S''. If S is a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] and it is ordered as a semigroup, one obtains the notion of [[ordered group]], and similarly if S is a [[monoid]] it may be called ''ordered monoid''. [[Ordered vector space|Partially ordered vector space]]s and [[Riesz space|vector lattice]]s are important in [[multiobjective optimization|optimization with multiple objectives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zălinescu|first=C.|title=Convex analysis in general vector spaces|publisher=World Scientific Publishing&amp;nbsp; Co.,&amp;nbsp;Inc|location = River Edge,&amp;nbsp;NJ|year= 2002|pages=xx+367|isbn=981-238-067-1|mr=1921556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social science can be described as all of the following:
* Branch of [[science]] &amp;ndash; systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Edward O. |title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge |edition=1st |publisher = Vintage Books |location = New York, NY |year = 1998 |isbn = 0-679-45077-7 |pages=49–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by [[mathematics]]; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&amp;nbsp;—p.vii, [[J.

* [[List of academic disciplines and sub-disciplines#Social sciences|Major category]] of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with academic areas of study or areas of professional practice. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines. For instance, gravitation is strongly associated with the discipline of physics, and is considered to be part of that disciplinary knowledge.

Bonnaterre is credited with identifying about 25 new species of fish, and assembled illustrations of about 400 in his encyclopedia work.

He was the first scientist to study Victor, the wild child of Aveyron, whose life inspired François Truffaut for his film ''[[The Wild Child]]''.

'''Strange matter''' is a particular form of [[quark matter]], usually thought of as a "liquid" of [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]] and [[strange quark]]s. It is to be contrasted with [[nuclear matter]], which is a liquid of [[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks), and with non-strange quark matter, which is a quark liquid containing only up and down quarks. At high enough density, strange matter is expected to be [[Color superconductivity|color superconducting]]. Strange matter is hypothesized to occur in the core of [[neutron star]]s, or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from [[femtometer]]s ([[strangelet]]s) to kilometers ([[quark star]]s).

==Two meanings of the term "strange matter"==

In [[particle physics]] and [[astrophysics]], the term is used in two ways, one broader and the other more specific&lt;ref name='Madsen:1998'&gt;J. Madsen, "Physics and astrophysics of strange quark matter" [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9809032 arXiv:astro-ph/9809032], ''Lect. Notes Phys.'' 516:162-203 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Weber'&gt;F. Weber, "Strange quark matter and compact stars", [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407155 arXiv:astro-ph/0407155], ''Prog. Part. Nucl. Phys.'' 54:193-288,2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

# The broader meaning is simply quark matter that contains three [[Quark#Classification|types of quarks]]: up, down, and strange. In this definition, there is a critical pressure and an associated critical density, and when nuclear matter (made of [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) is compressed beyond this density, the protons and neutrons dissociate into quarks, yielding quark matter (probably strange matter).
# The narrower meaning is that quark matter is ''more stable than nuclear matter'', i.e. that the true ground state of matter is quark matter. The idea that this could happen is the "strange matter hypothesis" of [[Arnold Rudolph Bodmer|Bodmer]]&lt;ref name='Bodmer'&gt;A. Bodmer. [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v4/i6/p1601_1 "Collapsed Nuclei"], ''Phys. Rev.'' D4, 1601 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Edward Witten|Witten]].&lt;ref name='Witten'&gt;[[Edward Witten]], [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v30/i2/p272_1 "Cosmic Separation Of Phases"], ''Phys. Rev. D30, 272'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, the critical pressure is zero. The nuclei that we see in the matter around us, which are droplets of nuclear matter, are actually [[metastable]], and given enough time (or the right external stimulus) would decay into droplets of strange matter, i.e. strangelets.

==Strange matter that is only stable at high pressure==

Under the broader definition, strange matter might occur inside neutron stars, if the pressure at their core is high enough (i.e. above the critical pressure). At the sort of densities we expect in the center of a neutron star, the quark matter would probably be strange matter. It could conceivably be non-strange quark matter, if the effective mass of the strange quark were too high. [[charm quark|Charm]] and heavier quarks would only occur at much higher densities.

A neutron star with a quark matter core is often&lt;ref name='Madsen:1998'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Weber'/&gt;  called a hybrid star. However, it is hard to know whether hybrid stars really exist in nature because physicists currently have little idea of the likely value of the critical pressure or density. It seems plausible{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;!-- ...and please explain how on the page--&gt; that the transition to quark matter will already have occurred when the separation between the [[nucleon]]s becomes much smaller than their size, so the critical density must be less than about 100 times nuclear saturation density. But a more precise estimate is not yet available, because the [[strong interaction]] that governs the behavior of quarks is mathematically intractable, and numerical calculations using [[lattice QCD]] are currently blocked by the fermion [[sign problem]].

One major area of activity in neutron star physics is the attempt to find observable signatures by which we could tell, from earth based observations of neutron stars, whether they have quark matter (probably strange matter) in their core. &lt;!-- See [[hybrid star]] --&gt;

==Strange matter that is stable at zero pressure==

If the "strange matter hypothesis" is true then nuclear matter is metastable against decaying into strange matter. The lifetime for spontaneous decay is very long, so we do not see this decay process happening around us.&lt;ref name='Witten'/&gt; However, under this hypothesis there should be strange matter in the universe:
# Quark stars (often called "strange stars") consist of quark matter from their core to their surface. They would be several kilometers across, and may have a very thin crust of nuclear matter.&lt;ref name='Weber'/&gt;
# Strangelets are small pieces of strange matter, perhaps as small as nuclei. They would be produced when strange stars are formed or collide, or when a nucleus decays.&lt;ref name='Madsen:1998'/&gt;

'''''The Devil's Teeth: A True Story of Obsession and Survival Among America's Great White Sharks''''' is a non-fiction book about [[great white sharks]] by American journalist Susan Casey. The text was initially published by [[Henry Holt and Company]] on June 7, 2005.{{sfn|Casey|2005}} The book became a widely acclaimed bestseller.

==Overview==
Susan Casey, a journalist and ocean lover, became infatuated with great white sharks of the [[Farallon Islands]]—dubbed by sailors in the 1850s the "devil's teeth." The sharks there are the alphas among alphas, some longer than twenty feet, and they congregate just twenty-seven miles off the coast of San Francisco. After going through many restrictions and barriers, she manages to join a group of scientists studying predation patterns by great white sharks within the so-called [[Red Triangle (Pacific Ocean)|Red Triangle]].{{sfn|Casey|2005}}

==Commentary==
{{quote|As the creative director of Outside magazine during its [[Jon Krakauer]]-[[Sebastian Junger]] heyday, Casey ([then] the development editor of Time Inc.) acquired a good ear for the false notes of [[ecotourism]] and a thorough understanding of the humbling swipe nature can take at cocky adventurers. Because of that awareness, she often allows herself to come across as a blundering nautical novice, which is refreshing (and true), though somewhat alarming considering that her lack of competence puts the researchers themselves and the funding for their project in jeopardy. In fact, though no one becomes shark bait, the story ends in misfortune for two of its cast, leaving one to wonder if the book itself is a bittersweet apologia to those who may have suffered because of Casey's admittedly single-minded obsession with the Farallon whites.|Louise Flynn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/books/review/05FLYN01.html|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|title='The Devil's Teeth': Great White Ways|accessdate=2015-05-13|date=June 5, 2005|first=LOUISE |last=FLYNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The Right Stuff''''' is a 1983 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[historical period drama|historical drama film]]. It was adapted from [[Tom Wolfe]]'s best-selling [[The Right Stuff (book)|1979 book of the same name]] about the Navy, Marine and Air Force [[test pilot]]s who were involved in [[aeronautics|aeronautical research]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]], as well as the [[Mercury Seven]], the seven military pilots who were selected to be the [[astronaut]]s for [[Project Mercury]], the first [[manned spaceflight]] by the United States. ''The Right Stuff'' was written and directed by [[Philip Kaufman]] and stars [[Ed Harris]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Barbara Hershey]]. [[Levon Helm]] is the narrator in the introduction and elsewhere in the film, as well as having a co-starring role as Air Force test pilot [[Jack Ridley (pilot)|Jack Ridley]].

The film was a box-office failure, grossing approximately $21 million against a $27 million budget. Despite this, it received widespread critical acclaim and eight [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[56th Academy Awards]], four of which it won. In 2013 the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref name="2013Add"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/library-of-congress-announces-2013-national-film-registry-selections/2013/12/17/eba98bce-6737-11e3-ae56-22de072140a2_story.html?tid=hpModule_ef3e52c4-8691-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394 "Library of Congress announces 2013 National Film Registry selections" (Press release).]  ''[[Washington Post]]'',  December 18, 2013.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;
In 1947, the Muroc Army Air Field in California has [[test pilot]]s fly high-speed aircraft such as the rocket-powered [[Bell X-1]], but some are killed as a result. After another pilot, [[Slick Goodlin]], demands $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1947|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) to attempt to break the [[sound barrier]], war hero Captain [[Chuck Yeager]] receives the chance to fly the X-1. While on a horseback ride with his wife Glennis, Yeager collides with a tree branch and breaks his ribs, which inhibits him from leaning over and locking the door to the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the mission, Yeager confides in friend and fellow pilot [[Jack Ridley (pilot)|Jack Ridley]]. Ridley cuts off part of a broomstick and tells Yeager to use it as a lever to help seal the hatch to the X-1, and Yeager becomes the first person to fly at [[supersonic]] speed, defeating the "demon in the sky".

Six years later, Muroc, now [[Edwards Air Force Base]], still attracts the best test pilots. Yeager (now a major) and friendly rival [[Albert Scott Crossfield|Scott Crossfield]] repeatedly break the other's speed records. They often visit the [[Happy Bottom Riding Club]] run by [[Pancho Barnes]], who classifies the pilots at Edwards as either "prime" (such as Yeager and Crossfield) that fly the best equipment or newer "pudknockers" who only dream about it. [[Gordon Cooper|Gordon "Gordo" Cooper]],  [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]] and [[Deke Slayton|Donald "Deke" Slayton]], captains of the [[United States Air Force]], are among the "pudknockers" who hope to also prove that they have "the Right Stuff". The tests are no longer secret, as the military soon recognizes that it needs good publicity for funding, and with "no bucks, no [[Buck Rogers]]". Cooper's wife, Trudy, and other wives are afraid of becoming widows, but cannot change their husbands' ambitions and desire for success and fame.

In 1957, the launch of the Russian [[Sputnik]] satellite [[Sputnik crisis|alarms the United States government]]. Politicians such as Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and military leaders demand that [[NASA]] help America defeat the Russians in the new [[Space Race]]. The search for the first Americans in space excludes Yeager because he lacks a college degree. Grueling physical and mental tests select the [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts, including [[John Glenn]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]], [[Alan Shepard]], [[Wally Schirra]] and [[Scott Carpenter]] of the [[United States Navy]], as well as Cooper, Grissom and Slayton; they immediately become national heroes. Although many early NASA rockets explode during launch, the ambitious astronauts all hope to be the first in space as part of [[Project Mercury]]. Although engineers see the men as passengers, the pilots insist that the Mercury spacecraft have a window, a hatch with explosive bolts, and [[pitch-yaw-roll]] controls. However, Russia beats them into space on April 12, 1961 with the launch of [[Vostok 1]] carrying [[Yuri Gagarin]] into space. The seven astronauts are determined to match and surpass the Russians.

Shepard is the first American to reach space on the 15-minute sub-orbital flight of [[Mercury-Redstone 3]] on May 5. After Grissom's similar flight of [[Mercury-Redstone 4]] on July 21, the capsule's hatch blows open and quickly fills with water. Grissom escapes, but the spacecraft, overweight with seawater, sinks. Many criticize Grissom for possibly panicking and opening the hatch prematurely. Glenn becomes the first American to orbit the Earth on [[Mercury-Atlas 6]] on February 20, 1962, surviving a possibly loose heat shield, and receives a [[ticker-tape parade]]. He, his colleagues, and their families become celebrities, including a gigantic celebration in the [[Sam Houston Coliseum]] to announce the opening of the Manned Space Center in [[Houston]], despite Glenn's wife [[Annie Glenn|Annie]]'s fear of public speaking due to a [[stutter]].

Although test pilots at Edwards mock the Mercury program for sending "spam in a can" into space, they recognize that they are no longer the fastest men on Earth, and Yeager states that "it takes a special kind of man to volunteer for a suicide mission, especially when it's on national TV." While testing the new [[Lockheed NF-104A]], Yeager attempts to set a new altitude record at the edge of space but is nearly killed in a high-speed ejection after his aircraft went out of control in a flat spin. Though seriously burned, after reaching the ground Yeager gathers up his parachute and walks to the ambulance, proving that he still has the Right Stuff.

On May 15, 1963, Cooper has a successful launch on [[Mercury-Atlas 9]], ending the Mercury program. As the last American to fly into space alone, he "went higher, farther, and faster than any other American ... for a brief moment, Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot anyone had ever seen."

==Production==
In 1979, independent producers Robert Chartoff and [[Irwin Winkler]] outbid [[Universal Pictures]] for the movie rights to [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book,&lt;ref name="Ansen"&gt;Ansen, David and Katrine Ames. "A Movie with All 'The Right Stuff'." ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 3, 1983, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; hiring [[William Goldman]] to write the screenplay. At Winkler's suggestion, Goldman's adaptation focused on the astronauts, entirely ignoring Chuck Yeager.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman 2001, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman was inspired to accept the job because he wanted to say something patriotic about America in the wake of the Iran hostage crisis.

In June 1980, [[United Artists]] agreed to finance the film up to $20 million, and the producers began looking for a director. [[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] was originally attached but fell through; so did [[John Avildsen]] who, four years prior, had won an Oscar for his work under Winkler and Chartoff on the original ''[[Rocky]]''. (''The Right Stuff'' would have reunited Avildsen with both producers, and also with a fourth ''Rocky'' veteran, composer [[Bill Conti]].) &lt;ref&gt;Goldman 2001, p 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Chartoff and Winkler approached director [[Philip Kaufman]], who agreed to make the film but did not like Goldman's script; Kaufman disliked the emphasis on patriotism, and wanted Yeager put back in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman 2001, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Goldman quit the project in August 1980 and United Artists pulled out.

When Wolfe showed no interest in adapting his own book, Kaufman wrote a draft in eight weeks.&lt;ref name="Ansen" /&gt; His draft restored Yeager to the story because "if you're serious about tracing where the future - read: space travel - began, its roots lay with Yeager and the whole test pilot-subculture. Ultimately, astronautics descended from that point."&lt;ref name="Wilford"&gt;Wilford, John Noble.

After the financial failure of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', the studio put ''The Right Stuff'' in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]. Then [[the Ladd Company]] stepped in with an estimated $17 million.

Actor Ed Harris auditioned twice in 1981 for the role of John Glenn. Originally, Kaufman wanted to use a troupe of contortionists to portray the press corps, but settled on the improvisational comedy troupe [[Fratelli Bologna]], known for its sponsorship of "St. Stupid's Day" in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; The director created a locust-like chatter to accompany the press corps whenever they appear, which was achieved through a sound combination of (among other things) motorized Nikon cameras and clicking beetles.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

Shot between March and October 1982, with additional filming continuing into January 1983, most of the film was shot in and around San Francisco, where a waterfront warehouse was transformed into a studio.&lt;ref name="Ansen" /&gt;{{refn|Downtown San Francisco doubled for [[Lower Manhattan]] in the [[ticker-tape parade]] scene after John Glenn's return to Earth. The scene was shot at the intersection of California and Montgomery Streets in the Financial District, and the [[Pacific Stock Exchange]] on the corner of Sansome and Pine Streets can be spotted doubling for the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in the final part of the scene.&lt;ref name= "Ansen"/&gt;|group = Note}}  Location shooting took place primarily at the abandoned [[Hamilton Air Force Base]] north of San Francisco which was converted into a sound stage for the numerous interior sets.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer 1984, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; No location could substitute for the distinctive [[Edwards Air Force Base]] landscape which necessitated the entire production crew move to the [[Mojave Desert]] for the opening sequences that framed the story of the test pilots at Muroc Army Air Field, later Edwards AFB.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer 1984, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional shooting took place in [[California City, California|California City]] in early 1983. During the filming of a sequence which portrayed Chuck Yeager's ejection from an NF-104&lt;ref&gt;Note that Yeager's ejection was from the highly specialized [[NF-104]] rocket jet, while the movie used a common unmodified F-104.&lt;/ref&gt; stuck in a flat spin resulting in his smoldering helmet being filled with smoke, stuntman Joseph Svec, a former Green Beret, was killed when he failed to open his parachute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/TheRightStuff-Svec.htm Svec's Freefall, Check-Six.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeager was hired as a technical consultant on the film. He took the actors flying, studied the storyboards and special effects, and pointed out the errors. To prepare for their roles, Kaufman gave the actors playing the seven astronauts an extensive videotape collection to study.&lt;ref name="Ansen" /&gt;

The efforts at making an authentic feature led to the use of many full size aircraft, scale models and special effects to replicate the scenes at Edwards Air Force Base and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].&lt;ref&gt;Farmer 1983, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; According to special visual effects supervisor Gary Gutierrez, the first special effects were too clean and they wanted a "dirty, funky, early NASA look."&lt;ref name="Ansen" /&gt; Gutierrez and his team started from scratch, employing unconventional techniques—like going up a hill with model airplanes on wires and fog machines to create clouds, or shooting model F-104s from a crossbow device and capturing their flight with up to four cameras.&lt;ref name="Ansen" /&gt; Avant garde filmmaker Jordan Belson created the background of the Earth as seen from high-flying planes and from orbiting spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Wilford" /&gt;

Kaufman gave his five editors a list of documentary images the film required and they searched the country for film from NASA, the Air Force, and Bell Aircraft vaults.&lt;ref name="Ansen" /&gt; They also discovered Russian stock footage not viewed in 30 years. During the course of the production, Kaufman met with resistance from the Ladd Company and threatened to quit several times.&lt;ref name="Ansen" /&gt; In December 1982, 8,000 feet of film portraying John Glenn's trip in orbit and return to Earth disappeared or was stolen from Kaufman's editing facility in [[Berkeley, California]]. The missing footage was never found but the footage was reconstructed from copies.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, Christian. "A Story that Pledges Allegiance to Drama and Entertainment."  ''[[Washington Post]]'', October 20, 1983, A18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical accuracy===
Although ''The Right Stuff''  was based on historical events and real people, as chronicled in Wolfe's book, some substantial dramatic liberties were taken. Neither Yeager's flight in the X-1 to break the sound barrier early in the film or his later, nearly fatal flight in the NF-104A were spur-of-moment, capriciously decided events, as the film seems to imply - they actually were part of the routine testing program for both aircraft. Yeager had already test-flown both aircraft a number of times previously and was very familiar with them.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Dr. James..

''The Right Stuff'' depicts Cooper arriving at Edwards in 1953, reminiscing with Grissom there about the two of them having supposedly flown together at the [[Langley Field|Langley Air Force Base]] and then hanging out with Grissom and Slayton, including  all three supposedly being present at Edwards when [[Scott Crossfield]] flew at [[Mach 2]] in November 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Famed-aviator-Scott-Crossfield-dies-in-plane-crash-1201589.php "Famed aviator Scott Crossfield dies in plane crash."] ''The Seattle Times,'' April 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The film shows the three of them being recruited together there for the astronaut program in late 1957, with Grissom supposedly expressing keen interest in becoming a "star-voyager". According to their respective NASA biographies, none of the three was posted to Edwards before 1955 (Slayton in 1955&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Tara. [https://history.nasa.gov/40thmerc7/slayton.htm "Donald K.

Gordon Cooper, Jr."] ''NASA''. Retrieved: July 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) and neither of the latter two had previously trained at Langley. By the time astronaut recruitment began in late 1957 after the Soviets had orbited [[Sputnik]], Grissom had already left Edwards and returned to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], where he had served previously and was happy with his new assignment there. Grissom did not even know he was under consideration for the astronaut program until he received mysterious orders "out of the blue" to report to Washington in civilian clothing for what turned out to be a recruitment session for  NASA.&lt;ref name="Grissom"/&gt; &lt;!--There has also been criticism of the way the film portrayed Grissom’s loss of his capsule, feeling it unfairly cast him in an unfavorable light.---See much more detailed explanation of the Liberty 7 incident in the 'Reviews' section of the "Reception"----&gt;

While the film took liberties with certain historical facts as part of "dramatic license", criticism focused on one: the portrayal of [[Gus Grissom]] panicking when his ''[[Liberty Bell 7]]'' spacecraft sank following splashdown. Most historians, as well as engineers working for or with [[NASA]] and many of the related contractor agencies within the aerospace industry, are now convinced that the premature detonation of the spacecraft hatch's explosive bolts was caused by mechanical failure not associated with direct human error or deliberate detonation by Grissom.{{refn|Schirra proved that activating the hatch explosives would have left a large welt on any part of the body that came in contact with the trigger. He proved this on his Mercury flight when he intentionally blew the hatch on October 3, 1962 when his spacecraft was on the deck of the recovery carrier.&lt;ref name ="Buckbee"&gt;Buckbee and Schirra 2005, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;|group = Note}} This determination had been made long before the film was completed.&lt;ref name="Buckbee" /&gt; Both Schirra and Gordon Cooper were critical of ''The Right Stuff'' for its treatment of Grissom,&lt;ref&gt;Buckbee and Schirra 2005, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper 2000, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; who was killed in the [[Apollo 1]] launch pad fire in January 1967 and thus unable to defend himself when the film was being made.  However, Kaufman was closely following [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book, which focused not on how or why the hatch actually blew, but how NASA engineers and some of Grissom's colleagues (and even his own wife) believed he caused the accident; much of the dialogue in this sequence was taken directly from Wolfe's prose.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe 1983, chapter 10 "The Unscrewable Pooch".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger.

===Film models===

A large number of film models were assembled for the production; for the more than 80 aircraft appearing in the film, static [[mock-up]]s and models were used as well as authentic aircraft of the period.&lt;ref name="Farmer p.49"&gt;Farmer 1983, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Colonel Duncan Wilmore, USAF (Ret) acted as the [[United States Air Force]] liaison to the production, beginning his role as a technical consultant in 1980 when the pre-production planning had begun. The first draft of the script in 1980 had concentrated only on the Mercury 7 but as subsequent revisions developed the treatment into more of the original story that Wolfe had envisioned, the aircraft of late-1940s that would have been seen at Edwards AFB were required. Wilmore gathered World War II era "prop" aircraft including:
* [[Douglas A-26 Invader]]
* [[North American P-51 Mustang]]
* [[North American T-6 Texan]] and
* [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]

The first group were mainly "set dressing" on the ramp while the [[Confederate Air Force]] (now renamed the Commemorative Air Force) B-29 [[FIFI (aircraft)|"Fifi"]] was modified to act as the B-29 "mothership" to carry the [[Bell X-1]] and [[Bell X-1#X-1A|X-1A]] rocket-powered record-breakers.&lt;ref name="Farmer p. 50–51"&gt;Farmer 1983, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other "real" aircraft included the early jet fighters and trainers as well as current USAF and [[United States Navy]] examples. These flying aircraft and helicopters included:
* [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]]
* [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]]
* [[North American F-86 Sabre]]
* [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]]
* [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]
* [[Sikorsky H-34|Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw]]
* [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King]]
* [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star]]
* [[Northrop T-38 Talon]]&lt;ref&gt;Farmer 1983, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of aircraft significant to the story had to be recreated. The first was an essentially static X-1 that had to at least roll and even realistically "belch flame" which was accomplished by a simulated rocket blast from the exhaust pipes.&lt;ref name="Farmer p.49" /&gt; A series of wooden mock-up X-1s were used to depict interior shots of the cockpit, the mating up of the X-1 to a modified B-29 fuselage and bomb bay and ultimately to recreate flight in a combination of model work and live-action photography. The "follow-up" X-1A was also an all-wooden model.&lt;ref name="Farmer p. 50–51" /&gt;

The U.S. Navy's [[Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket]] that Crossfield duelled with Yeager's X-1 and X-1A was recreated from a modified [[Hawker Hunter]] jet fighter. The climactic flight of Yeager in a [[Lockheed NF-104A]] was originally to be made with a modified [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] but ultimately, Wilmore decided that the production had to make do with a repainted Luftwaffe F-104G, which lacks the rocket engine of the NF-104.&lt;ref name="Farmer p. 50–51" /&gt;

Wooden mock-ups of the Mercury space capsules also realistically depicted the NASA spacecraft and were built from the original mold.&lt;ref name="Wilford" /&gt;

For many of the flying sequences, scale models were produced by USFX Studios and filmed outdoors in natural sunlight against the sky. Even off-the-shelf plastic scale models were utilized for aerial scenes. The X-1, F-104 and B-29 models were built in large numbers as a number of the more than 40 scale models were destroyed in the process of  filming.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer 1984, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; The blending together of miniatures, full-scale mock-ups and actual aircraft was seamlessly integrated into the live-action footage. The addition of original newsreel footage was used sparingly but to effect to provide another layer of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer 1984, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[David Ansen]] wrote, "When ''The Right Stuff'' takes to the skies, it can't be compared with any other movie, old or new: it's simply the most thrilling flight footage ever put on film".&lt;ref name="Ansen" /&gt; Gary Arnold in his review for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', wrote, "The movie is obviously so solid and appealing that it's bound to go through the roof commercially and keep on soaring for the next year or so".&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Vincent Canby praised Shepard's performance: "Both as the character he plays and as an iconic screen presence, Mr. Shepard gives the film much well-needed heft.

Yeager said of the film: "Sam [Shepard] is not a real flamboyant actor, and I'm not a real flamboyant-type individual ... he played his role the way I fly airplanes".&lt;ref name="Ansen" /&gt; Deke Slayton said that none of the film "was all that accurate, but it was well done".&lt;ref name="Bumiller"&gt;Bumiller, Elisabeth and Phil McCombs.

They made them like bumbling Germans".&lt;ref name="Bumiller" /&gt; Scott Carpenter felt that it was a "great movie in all regards".&lt;ref name="Bumiller" /&gt;

[[Robert Osborne]], who introduced showings of the film on [[Turner Classic Movies]], was quite enthusiastic about the film. The cameo appearance by the real Chuck Yeager in the film was a particular "treat" which Osborne cited. The recounting of many of the legendary aspects of Yeager's life was left in place, including the naming of the X-1, "Glamorous Glennis" after his wife and his superstitious preflight ritual of asking for a stick of [[Beemans gum|Beemans chewing gum]] from his best friend, Jack Ridley.{{refn|This allusion to Beemans chewing gum was later included in ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'' (1991).|group = Note}}

When the film came out, the former (and future) astronaut [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Glenn]] of [[Ohio]] was running for the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nomination for [[President of the United States]]. In the weeks before the movie's premiere, media pundits as well as people in the Democratic Party wondered that if the film became a big success, it could give Glenn an advantage in the upcoming primaries, a speculation that eventually proved groundless.

==Media==
On June 23, 2003, Warner Bros. released a two-disc [[DVD]] Special Edition that featured scene-specific commentaries with key cast and crew members, deleted scenes, three documentaries on the making of ''The Right Stuff'' including interviews with Mercury astronauts and Chuck Yeager, and a feature-length PBS documentary, ''John Glenn: American Hero''. These extras are also included in the November 5, 2013 release of the 30th Anniversary edition, which also includes a 40-page book binding case, with the film in [[Blu-ray]] format. The extras are in standard DVD format.

In addition, the [[British Film Institute]] published a book on ''The Right Stuff'' by Tom Charity in October 1997 that offered a detailed analysis and behind-the-scenes anecdotes.

==Soundtrack==
Although an album mix had been prepared by [[Bill Conti]] in 1983 (and indeed the poster contains the credit "Original Soundtrack Available On [[Geffen Records]]"), the soundtrack album release was cancelled following the film's disappointing box office.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes, ''The Right Stuff'' Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, VCL 0609 1095&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Conti conducted a re-recording of selections from the score and from his music for ''[[North and South (miniseries)|North and South]]'', performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and released by [[Varèse Sarabande]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/original-scores-by-bill-conti-the-right-stuff-north-and-south-mw0000191468 "The Right Stuff/North and South."] ''AllMusic''.

'''Thomas Brown Jordan''' (24 October 1807 – 31 May 1890) was a British inventor and engineer.

==Birth and beginnings==
Born at [[Bristol]] on 24 October 1807,&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; he was the son of Thomas Jordan (a [[Quaker]] engineer),&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; and began life as an artist.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{harvnb|Seccombe|1892|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Cornwall==
When barely twenty he moved to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. While painting there and at [[Penzance]] he made the acquaintance of [[Robert Were Fox the Younger]], in whose physical researches he took the greatest interest, as well as becoming drawing master to Fox's son, [[Barclay Fox|Barclay]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{harvnb|McConnell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barclay Fox's ''Journal'' makes it clear that Jordan was one of several young, talented tutors employed by R. W. Fox to educate his three children and their friend [[Cavendish Wall]]. The first drawing lesson was in 28 Ninth Month (September) 1832 (page 41). Barclay records Jordan's exhibit at the annual Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Exhibition in Ninth Month, 1832 ({{harvnb|Fox|1979|pp=96,97}}): the "galvano-motive machine" and in 1839 ({{harvnb|Fox|1979|p=147}}), his lecture on his new "photogenic inventions".  The [[Fox family of Falmouth]] were the major force in developing the arts, sciences and technology in Falmouth. [[Anna Maria Fox]], Barclay's older sister became a talented amateur artist and promoter of the practical arts and painting. However, his younger sister, [[Caroline Fox]], has no mention of Jordan in the edited extracts of her ''Journal'', published in 1972. Both Jordan's father and the Fox family were Quakers.  McConnell, in the ODNB, suggests that Jordan may have separated from that faith when he married a non-Quaker ({{harvnb|McConnell|2004}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventor==
R.W.Fox's influence led him to relinquish painting and to set up as a mathematical instrument maker in Falmouth, where he effected improvements in the [[miners' dial]],&lt;ref&gt;Miner's dial or mine dial – An underground surveying instrument for measuring and setting out angles and determining magnetic north ([http://www.maden.hacettepe.edu.tr/dmmrt/dmmrt750.html Hacettepe University Department of Mining Engineering] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423053722/http://www.maden.hacettepe.edu.tr/dmmrt/dmmrt750.html |date=23 April 2008 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; and had some share in the construction of Fox's improved [[dipping-needle]]. In 1838 Jordan devised an instrument for recording by photography the variations of the barometric column, and he shortly afterwards invented a declination [[magnetograph]] and a self-recording [[actinometer]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; His pioneering use of photography in meteorology was acknowledged by both [[Charles Wheatstone]] and Sir [[John Herschel]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; For some years subsequent to 1839 he held the post of secretary of the [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He was succeeded by [[Robert Hunt (scientist)|Robert Hunt]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Henry de la Beche]], when engaged on the geological survey of [[Cornwall]], made Jordan's acquaintance, and secured his appointment in 1840 as first keeper of mining records, with charge of plans, sections, and models. Jordan took a great interest in [[Hydrometallurgy|electro-metallurgy]] during the early years of its development, and in 1841 he made an egg-cup of electro-deposited copper, plated with silver outside and gold inside, which was considered a model of workmanship, and is now deposited in the [[Museum of Practical Geology]], Jermyn Street, London.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

==London move==
Upon resigning his appointment as keeper of mining records in 1845, Jordan invented a highly ingenious process of carving by machinery, and set up works at [[Lambeth]] for carrying into effect the invention, for which in 1847 he received the gold Isis medal from the [[Society of Arts]],&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; and in the same year he was elected a Fellow of the Society.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; The wood-carving machinery was subsequently exhibited at the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]], and the products were extensively used in the decoration of the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

Later on Jordan started work as a [[mechanical engineer]], first at [[Manchester]], then at [[Glasgow]], where he devised a series of machines for the production of [[Slate (writing)|school slates]]. Shortly after 1870, however, he returned to London, and established himself as a [[mining engineer]] in conjunction with his son, Mr. Thomas Rowland Jordan. Jordan's last invention, patented in 1877, was a portable machine for boring blast-holes in rock.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', Thursday, 29 November 1877, p.6, col F, "A new rock drill" (reports a demonstration of the machine).&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Bournemouth]] on 31 May 1890.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

==Personal life and eventual death==
Jordan married, in 1837, Sarah Dunn. They had eleven children. He died 1890-05-31. Mrs. Jordan survived him.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1697">'''WomensHub''' is a Philippines-based non-government organisation that supports "women struggling for self-determination" in using ICTs, or information and communication technologies.

This organisation recently completed three years as a collective. It joined the Asia-Pacific programme of the [[Association for Progressive Communications]]'s Women Network Support Programme.

Its focus, inter alia, has been to increase the visibility of gender and ICT issues during the [[Asia-Pacific]] NGO Conference for the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] held in mid-2004 in [[Bangkok]], the capital of [[Thailand]]. WomensHub members there ran the internet access facility in the conference site, and provided user-support to conference participants.

WomensHub was [http://www.globalknowledge.org/gkps_portal/thematic.cfm?&amp;menuid=114&amp;thematicid=5&amp;action=ThResView&amp;ResId=302&amp;type=2 created] in December 2000 "to advance women and social movement issues in the field of ICTs."

It works on promoting gender equality through ICTs, and also supports the [[Women's Electronic Network Training]] (WENT) of the [[Asian Women's Resource Exchange]] (AWORC). WENT offers an annual workshop on electronic networking, open to women and organizations, which helps to build skills in women's organizations and networks in [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific]].
