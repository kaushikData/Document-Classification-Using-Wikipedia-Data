The '''1944 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference''' was the first [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference|Meeting]] of the [[List of Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[British Commonwealth]]. It was held in the [[United Kingdom]], between 1–16 May 1944, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]].

The conference was attended by the Prime Ministers of all of the Dominions within the Commonwealth except Ireland.  Attendees included Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] of Australia, Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] of Canada, Prime Minister [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]] of [[New Zealand]] and Prime Minister [[Jan Smuts]] of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]].  Also attending was Prime Minister [[Godfrey Huggins, 1st Viscount Malvern|Sir Godfrey Huggins]] of the [[self-governing colony]] of [[Southern Rhodesia]], and representing [[British Raj|India]] was [[Hari Singh|The Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]. Members of the [[Churchill war ministry|Churchill War Cabinet]] and the High Commissioners of the Dominions also attended.

Ireland did not participate although at the time the British Commonwealth still regarded Ireland as one of its members. Ireland had not participated in any equivalent conferences since 1932.

The British Commonwealth leaders agreed to support the [[Moscow Declaration]] and reached agreement regarding their respective roles in the overall [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort.

Prior to the conference, [[Robert McIntyre]] and [[Douglas Young (classicist)|Douglas Young]], the leaders of the [[Scottish National Party]], lobbied King, Fraser, Smuts, Huggins, and Curtin, asking them to raise the issue of [[Scottish independence]] at the conference and to invite [[Scotland]] to take part in it and all future Commonwealth Conferences. Curtin viewed it as an internal matter for the British government, King was sympathetic, and the remainder simply voiced their acknowledgement of the communiques.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Library of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]].

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freedom of Information (FOI) in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] is regulated by chapter 3 of the General Administrative code of Georgia, which is in force since 1999. Despite the fact that the ensuring legal framework on freedom of information contains sound provisions, in view of the existing international standards and practices, as well as existing practices in Georgia, the act is considered outdated &lt;ref name=IDFI&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= December 2015 |title= Access to Public Information in Georgia. Report Summarizing 2010 - 2015| url= https://idfi.ge/en/access-to-public-information-in-georgia-report-summarizing-2010%E2%80%932015 |publisher= Institute for Development of Freedom of Information (IDFI)  |issue= |access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)]] Anti-Corruption Network noted that Georgia's FOI provisions would benefit from a comprehensive and wide revisions.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= July 2016| title= Third Round of Monitoring. Georgia. Monitoring Report |url=https://www.osgf.ge/files/2016/EU%20publication/Angarishi_A4__Corruption_ENG.pdf  |publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Anti-corruption Network for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Istanbul Anti-corruption Action Plan |access-date= 24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Georgian civil society organisations have advocated for improvements of the law, and the Government took obligation to elaborate a new law on freedom of information.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; The adoption of a new Freedom of Information law is one of the Georgian Government's commitments in the framework of its annual action plan for the implementation of the [[European Union Association Agreement|Association Agreement]] between the [[European Union|EU]] and Georgia signed in 2014.&lt;ref name=OSGF&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= July 2016|title=Reforming Georgia’s Access to Information Law |url=https://www.osgf.ge/files/2016/EU%20publication/Angarishi_A4__Corruption_ENG.pdf  |publisher=Open Society Georgia Foundation |access-date= 24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

The existing law states that all public information is open except for the cases established by the law and the information covered by privacy rights or commercial secret. In Georgia, anyone is entitled to request public information. The applicants do not have to specify the reasons for their request. An applicant has the option to be allowed to view the original of the information required or to ask for a copy. Requests for information should be made in writing, including via electronic means.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Fees for the provision of public information are expressly prohibited by the law, except for covering the actual costs for producing copies.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

Public institutions are obliged to provide the requested information immediately or not later than within 10 working days of the application.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Applicants must be notified of the refusal to disclose information immediately and must be given, within 3 days of the refusal, a written explanation of the reason for denial and with information on the appeals procedures. In the appeal procedures, aiming at challenging the denial decision of a public institution, the burden of the proof lies with the public institutions.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

The Georgian law also establishes that public bodies have to proactively publish information, that is without the need of sending a request, according to the rules set forth in secondary legislation, namely in the amendment made to the General Administrative Code of Georgia in 2012 on proactive disclosure and electronic request of public information.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

Public institutions are obliged to report annually to Parliament, the President and the Prime Minister on their compliance with access to information law and provide updated statistics and data.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

One of the most important novelties of the draft elaborated by civil society and experts is the establishment of the office of the [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]], a new institution with the mandate of monitoring the application of the law, revealing cases of misconduct and taking action to protect the right to public information.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; This would address one of the major gaps in existing legislation, i.e. the lack of a designed central body with the power to oversee the compliance of public institutions with existing regulations.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Another shortcoming of the current legal framework concerns the lack of a sanctions system in cases of non-compliance.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Also, the exceptions for non-disclosure are ambiguous and not clearly defined in the law which does not cover state-owned enterprises.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

The shortcomings of the law have resulted in an uneven application of the right to access to information in  practice. In this process, the judiciary has not proven to be an effective means of dealing with the refusals of some public institutions to push them to disclose the required information.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

==Access to information in practice==

Access to information law is poorly enforced in Georgia and its application remains a problem.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; A local NGO, the [[Institute for Development of Freedom of Information|Institute for Development of Freedom of Information (IDFI)]], has conducted a comprehensive analysis assessing the implementation of the law and the compliance of public institutions to it, carrying out a series of large-scale FOI tests between 2010-2015.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

The IDFI study shows that in the period monitored, 24% of the request filed by the organisation remained unanswered. A complete answer was received in 64% of cases and an incomplete one in 10%, while the refusal to provide the information required occurred in 2% of the cases.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; In terms of annual evaluation, the overall response rate was the worst in 2010-11, while it improved significantly in 2012-13 - as a result of the 2012 parliamentary elections - but started to deteriorate again in 2014. Over time, the rate of provision of the requested information within the deadline established by the law improved significantly, ranging from 22% of 2010 to 75% of 2015.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; The assessment also found out great variations between public agencies with regard to their compliance with the law: for instance, some ministers recorded a 100% response rate, others provided a complete answer in less than 50% of the cases, while the lowest score concerned the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development with a mere 10% in the rating.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt;

'''Amarna letter EA 223''', titled: ''"Compliance With Orders"''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 223, ''"Compliance With Orders"'', p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; is a very short [[clay tablet]] letter from [[Endaruta]] of [[city-state]] [[Achshaph|Akšapa]] ([[Achshaph]]). It is the only letter authored by Endaruta. One of the ten Pharaoh letters written to persons/ or states in the [[Amarna letters]] corpus, is [[Amarna letter EA 367]] (titled: ''From the Pharaoh to a Vassal'').

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 20–25 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial [[corpus linguistics|corpus]] of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city [[Akhetaten]], in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

Letter EA 223 is numbered VAT 1870, from the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin]].

{{Sound change}}
In [[linguistics]], '''assibilation''' is a [[sound change]] resulting in a [[sibilant]] consonant. It is a form of [[spirantization]] and is commonly the final phase of [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].

==Romance languages==
The word "assibilation" itself contains an example of the phenomenon, as it is pronounced {{IPA|/əsɪbɪleɪʃən/}}. The [[Classical Latin]] {{lang|la|-tio}} was pronounced {{IPA|/tio/}} (for example, {{lang|la|assibilatio}} was pronounced {{IPA|/asːibilatio/}} and {{lang|la|attentio}} {{IPA|/atːentio/}}). However, in [[Vulgar Latin]], it assibilated to {{IPA|/tsio/}}, which can still be seen in [[Italian language|Italian]]: {{lang|it|attenzione}}.

In [[French language|French]], [[lenition]] then gave {{IPA|/sj/}}, which was further palatalized in the [[English language|English]] loanword to {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.

Assibilation can occur in some varieties of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] such as in Ecuador and Mexico. It is closely related to the phonetic term ''sibilation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matus-Mendoza|first=Maríadelaluz|date=2004-03-01|title=Assibilation of /-r/ and migration among Mexicans|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-variation-and-change/article/assibilation-of-r-and-migration-among-mexicans/0C7D60EDFE47E07A6D5862EF5F2B7694|journal=Language Variation and Change|volume=16|issue=1|pages=17–30|doi=10.1017/S0954394504161024|issn=1469-8021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germanic languages==
In the [[High German consonant shift]], voiceless stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} [[spirantization|spirantized]] to {{IPA|/f, s, x/}} at the [[syllable coda|end]] of a [[syllable]]. The shift of {{IPA|/t/}} to {{IPA|/s/}} (as in English ''water'', [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Wasser}}) is assibilation.

Assibilation occurs without palatalization for some speakers of [[African American Vernacular English]] in which {{IPA|/θ/}} is alveolarized to {{IPA|/s/}} when it occurs at the end of a syllable and within a word before another consonant, leading to such pronunciations as the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rehabmed.ualberta.ca/spa/phonology/features.htm Phonological Features of African American Vernacular English]&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|''bathroom''||- {{IPA|/ˈbæs.ruːm/}}
|-
|''birthday''||- {{IPA|/ˈbɝs.deɪ/}}
|}

==Greek==
[[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|*t}} and {{PIE|*dʰ}} (Greek {{transl|grc|th}}) shifted to [[Proto-Greek]] {{IPA|/s/}} before {{PIE|*y}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek Grammar''. [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1d_uni.htm#113 par. 113]: ty, thy &gt; s, ss&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{PIE|*tot-yos}} -&gt; [[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] {{transl|grc|tóssos}} &gt; [[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{transl|grc|tósos}} "this much" (Latin {{lang|la|tot}})
*{{PIE|*medʰ-yos}} &gt; Homeric {{transl|grc|méssos}} &gt; Attic {{transl|grc|mésos}} "middle" (Latin {{lang|la|medius}})

{{PIE|*ti}} shifted to {{IPA|/si/}} finally in Attic and [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]],&lt;ref&gt;Smyth. [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1d_uni.htm#113 par. 115]: -ti &gt; -si.&lt;/ref&gt; but not in [[Doric Greek|Doric]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyth. [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1d_notes.htm#115D note 115]: Doric -ti.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Doric {{transl|grc|títhēti}} – Attic-Ionic {{transl|grc|títhēsi}} "he/she places"

==Finnic languages==
[[Finnic languages]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and their closest relatives) had {{IPA|*ti}} changed to {{IPA|/si/}}. The alternation can be seen in dialectal and inflected word forms: Finnish {{lang|fi|kieltää}} "to deny" → {{lang|fi|kielti}} ~ {{lang|fi|kielsi}} "s/he denied"; {{lang|fi|vesi}} "water" vs. {{lang|fi|vete-nä}} "as water".

An intermediate stage /ts/ is preserved in [[South Estonian]] in certain cases: ''tsiga'' "pig", vs. Finnish {{lang|fi|sika}}, Standard (North) Estonian {{lang|et|siga}}.

==Arabic==
A characteristic of [[Mashreq]]i [[varieties of Arabic]] (particularly [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]] and [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]]) is to assibilate the [[interdental consonant]]s of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA) in certain contexts (defined more culturally than phonotactically). Thus, {{transl|ar|[[ṯāʾ]]}}, pronounced {{IPAblink|θ}} in MSA, becomes {{IPAblink|s}} (as MSA {{IPA|/θaqaːfah/}} → Levantine {{IPA|/saqaːfeh/}} "culture"); {{transl|ar|[[ḏāl]]}}, pronounced {{IPAblink|ð}} in MSA, becomes {{IPAblink|z}} (as MSA {{IPA|/ðanb/}} → Levantine {{IPA|/zamb/}} "guilt"); and {{transl|ar|[[ẓāʾ]]}}, pronounced {{IPAblink|ðˤ}} in MSA, becomes {{IPAblink|zˤ}} (as MSA {{IPA|/maħðˤuːðˤ/}} → Levantine {{IPA|/maħzˤuːzˤ/}} "lucky").

Diachronically, the phoneme represented by the letter {{transl|ar|[[gimel|ǧīm]]}} has in, some dialects, experienced assibilation as well. The pronunciation in [[Classical Arabic]] is reconstructed to have been {{IPA|[ɡʲ]}} or {{IPAblink|ɟ}} (or perhaps both dialectically); it is cognate to {{IPAblink|ɡ}} in most other [[Semitic languages]], and it is understood to be derived from that sound in [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]]. It has experienced extensive change in pronunciation over the centuries, and is pronounced  at least six different ways across the assorted varieties of Arabic. A common one is {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, the end result of a process of palatalization starting with Proto-West Semitic {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, then {{IPA|[ɡʲ]}} or {{IPAblink|ɟ}}, then {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} (a pronunciation still current) and finally {{IPAblink|ʒ}} (in Levantine and non-Algerian [[Maghrebi Arabic|Maghrebi]]). The last pronunciation is considered acceptable for use in MSA, along with {{IPAblink|ɡ}} and {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}}.

[[File:Embryo, 8 cells.jpg|thumb|[[Human embryo]] at 8-cell stage]]
The '''beginning of human personhood''' is the moment when a [[human]] is first recognized as a [[person]]. There are differences of opinion as to the precise time when human [[personhood]] begins and the nature of that status. The issue arises in a number of fields including science, religion, philosophy, and law, and is most acute in debates relating to [[abortion debate|abortion]], [[stem cell controversy|stem cell research]], [[reproductive rights]], and [[fetal rights]].

==Scope==
Traditionally, the concept of [[personhood]] has entailed the concept of [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] concept referring to a non-corporeal or extra-corporeal dimension of [[human being]]. However, in [[modernity]], the concepts of [[subjectivity]] and [[intersubjectivity]], [[personhood]], [[mind]], and [[self]] have come to encompass a number of aspects of human being previously considered to be characteristics of the [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], ''Sources of the Self: The Making of Modern Identity'', Harvard University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Foucault]], ''The Hermeneutics of the Subject'', New York: Picador, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the beginning of human personhood, one historical question has been: when does the [[ensoulment|soul enter the body]]? In modern terms, the question could be put instead: at what point does the developing individual develop personhood or selfhood?&lt;ref&gt;The question could also be put historically. The concept of "personhood" is of fairly recent vintage, and cannot be found in the 1828 edition of  [http://1828.mshaffer.com/ 1828 edition of Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language], nor even as late as [http://machaut.uchicago.edu/websters 1913] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710101105/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/websters |date=10 July 2012 }}. A search in dictionaries and encyclopedia for the term "personhood" generally redirects to "person". The American Heritage Dictionary at Yahoo has: "The state or condition of being a person, especially having those qualities that confer distinct individuality."&lt;/ref&gt;

Related issues attached to the question of the beginning of human personhood include both the legal status, bodily integrity, and subjectivity of mothers&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Bordo]], "Are Mothers Persons?", ''Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture and the Body'', Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 2003, 71-97.&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosophical concept of "natality" (i.e. "the distinctively human capacity to initiate a new beginning", which a new human life embodies).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolas Kompridis]], "The Idea of a New Beginning: A romantic source of normativity and freedom," ''Philosophical Romanticism'', New York: Routledge, 2006, 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and religious perspectives==

Answers to the question of when human life begins and  when personhood begins have varied among social contexts, and have changed with shifts in ethical and religious beliefs, sometimes as a result of advances in scientific knowledge; in general they have developed in parallel with attitudes to [[abortion debate|abortion]]&lt;ref name="devbio"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gilbert |first=Scott F. |title=When Does Human Life Begin? |website=DevBio |year=2006 |url=http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?id=162 |accessdate=2008-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406045953/http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?id=162 |archivedate=6 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the use of [[infanticide]] as a means of reproductive control.

Since the zygote is genetically identical to the embryo, the fully formed fetus, and the baby, questioning the beginning of personhood could lead to an instance of the [[Sorites paradox]], also known as ''the paradox of the heap''.&lt;ref name=Sorites_JVI&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/a:1004375726894 |title=Fetal Personhood and the Sorites Paradox |year=1998 |last1=Kerckhove |first1=Lee F |journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=175–189 |last2=Waller |first2=Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neil Postman]] has written that in pre-modern societies, the lives of children were not regarded as unique or valuable in the same way they are in modern societies, in part as a result of high [[infant mortality]]. However, when childhood began to develop its own distinctive features (including graded schools to teach reading, children's stories, games, etc.) this view changed. According to Postman, "the custom of celebrating a child's birthday did not exist in America throughout most of the eighteenth century, and, in fact, the precise marking of a child's age in any way is a relatively recent cultural habit, no more than two hundred years old."&lt;ref&gt;Neil Postman, ''The Disappearance of Childhood'', New York: Vintage, 1994, xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient writers held diverse views on the subject of the beginning of personhood, understood as the soul's entry or development in the human body. In ''Panpsychism in the West'', David Skrbina noted the various kinds of soul envisioned by the early Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skrbina |first=David F. |authorlink=David Skrbina |title=Panpsychism in the West |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=9780262195225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the question of the ensoulment of the fetus revolved around the question of when the rational soul entered the body,  whether it was an integral part of the bodily form and substance, or whether it was pre-existent and subject to [[reincarnation]] or [[pre-existence]].

The Stoics, holding a belief in the [[pneuma]], held that the soul enters the body when the newborn takes its first breath.

[[Aristotle]] developed a theory of progressive ensoulment. In ''[[On the Generation of Animals]]'', he declared that the soul develops first a vegetative soul, then animal, and finally human, adding that abortions were permissible early in pregnancy, before certain biological&lt;!--and neurological?--&gt; processes began. He believed that the female substance was passive, the male active, and that it required time for the male substance to "animate" the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |title=On the Generation of Animals |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/book2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippocrates]] and the [[Pythagoreans]] stated that fertilization marked the beginning of a human life, and that the human soul was created at the time of fertilization.

According to ''[[Hinduism Today]]'', [[Vedas|Vedic literature]] states that the soul enters the body at conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Hindus In America Speak out on Abortion Issues |magazine=[[Hinduism Today]] |date=September 1985 |url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts of [[pre-existence]] are found in various forms in Plato, Judaism, and Islam.
 
The Jewish [[Talmud]] holds that all life is precious but that a fetus is not a person, in the sense of termination of pregnancy being considered murder. If a woman's life is endangered by a pregnancy, an abortion is permitted.  However, if the "greater part" of the fetus has emerged from the womb, then its life may not be taken even to save the woman's, ''"because you cannot choose between one human life and another".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rich | first = Tracey R | title = Abortion | website = Kosher Sex | publisher = Judaism 101 | year = 1999 | url = http://www.jewfaq.org/sex.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081217181056/http://www.jewfaq.org/sex.htm| archivedate= 17 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some medieval [[Christian]] theologians, such as [[Marsilio Ficino]], held that [[ensoulment]] occurs when an infant takes its first breath of air.  They cite, among other passages, Genesis 2:7, which reads: "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Martin |first = Ernest L. |author2=David Sielaff |title = 3.

The Early Church held various views on the subject, primarily either the ensoulment at conception or delayed hominization. [[Tertullian]] held a view, [[traducianism]], which was later condemned as heresy. This view held that the soul was derived from the parents and generated in parallel with the generation of the physical body. This viewpoint was deemed unsatisfactory by [[St. Augustine]], as it did not account for original sin. Basing himself on the Septuagint version of Exodus 21:22, he affirmed the Aristotelian view of delayed hominization.

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]] and [[St. Augustine of Hippo]] held the view that fetuses were "animated" (using Aristotle's term for ensoulment) near the 40th day after conception.&lt;ref name="devbio"/&gt; However, both held that abortion was always gravely wrong.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald, 1"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing| isbn = 9780802838438| pages = 1| editors = Allan D.

In general, the soul was viewed as some kind of animating principle; and the human variety was referred to as the "rational soul".

==Fetal personhood in law==

===Ecclesiastical courts===

Following the decline of the Roman Empire, [[ecclesiastical courts]] held wide jurisdiction throughout Europe.  According to Donald DeMarco, PhD,&lt;ref&gt;Donald DeMarco, PhD, [http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=3362&amp;CFID=52448371&amp;CFTOKEN=98913006 The Roman Catholic Church and Abortion: An Historical Perspective - Part II]&lt;/ref&gt; the Church treated the killing of an unformed or "unanimated" fetus as a matter of "anticipated homicide", with a corresponding lesser penance required. In the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], the following statement regarding the beginning of human life and personhood is provided:
:Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person - among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7Z.HTM#-2C6] Paragraph 2270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law===

Although [[abortion in the United Kingdom]] was traditionally dealt with in the [[ecclesiastical court]]s, English common law addressed the issue from 1115 on, beginning with first mention in ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]''. In this treatise, abortion, even of a "formed" fetus, was a "quasi-homicide", carrying a penalty of 10 years' penance. This was a much lesser penalty than would accrue to full homicide. With the exception of Bracton, later writers insisted that killing a fetus was "great misprision, and no murder", as formulated by [[Sir Edward Coke]] in his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]''. Coke noted that the murder victim must have been "a reasonable creature ''in rerum natura''", in accordance with the standards of [[murder in English law]]. This formulation was repeated by [[Sir William Blackstone]] in England and in ''[[Bouvier's Law Dictionary]]'' in the United States.

The reasonableness of the creature is of some considerable weight in the legal conception of personhood. Children are not considered full persons under the law until they reach the age of majority.

Nonetheless, children have been treated as persons with respect to bodily offences, beginning with [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]], although this protection did not prevent children from being sold by their parents, as in the [[Eliza Armstrong case]], long after the slave trade had been abolished in England.

In addition, "a child ''[[en ventre sa mere]]''" (in utero) was regarded by common law as "in being," or "as born" when ensuring that wills and trusts do not run afoul of the [[rule against perpetuities]]; nine (or sometimes ten) months of gestation were allotted for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gray |first1=John Chipman|title=The Rule Against Perpetuities|date=1915|publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston |isbn=978-1-58477-307-8 |page=196 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=63xG4oBiVnAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=rule+against+perpetuities#v=onepage&amp;q=ventre&amp;f=false |accessdate=29 June 2017|quote=Whatever may have formerly been the law, it is now generally agreed that a child ''en vetre sa mere'' is to be considered as born, when it is to be for its benefit to be so considered.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological markers==
One of the possible basic requirements for personhood is [[individuality]], which entails differentiation between the person and its parents.  [[Biology]] offers a number of stages in the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] that have been seen as candidates for personhood:
* [[fertilisation|fertilization]], the fusing of the [[gamete]]s to form a [[zygote]]
* [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], occurring about a week after fertilization
* segmentation, after [[twin]]ning is no longer possible, roughly 14 days after fertilization.&lt;ref name="twinning"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(03)14237-7 |pmid=12957099 |title=Twinning |journal=The Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9385 |pages=735–743 |year=2003 |last1=Hall |first1=Judith G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fertilization ===
Fertilization is the fusing of the gametes, that is a [[sperm]] cell and an [[ovum]] (egg cell), to form a zygote. At this point, the zygote is [[gene]]tically distinct from either of its parents.

Fertilization was not understood in ancient times. [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Augustus|Augustus Caesar]] were [[Miraculous births#Heroes and historical figures|reputed to have been conceived without fertilization]] ([[Miraculous births|virgin birth]]). [[Hippocrates]] believed that the embryo was the product of male semen and a female factor. But [[Aristotle]] held that only male semen gave rise to an embryo, while the female only provided a place for the embryo to develop,&lt;ref name="fertile"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrm3643 |pmid=23942453 |pmc=4021448 |title=Restarting life: Fertilization and the transition from meiosis to mitosis |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=549–562 |year=2013 |last1=Clift |first1=Dean |last2=Schuh |first2=Melina }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a concept he acquired from the [[Preformationism|preformationist]] [[Pythagoras]]). [[Spermatozoon|Sperm]] cells were discovered in 1677 by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], who believed that Aristotle had been proven correct.&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0531.2012.02105.x |pmid=22827343 |title=An Amazing 10 Years: The Discovery of Egg and Sperm in the 17th Century |journal=Reproduction in Domestic Animals |volume=47 |pages=2–6 |year=2012 |last1=Cobb |first1=M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers believed they could see an entirely pre-formed little human body in the head of a sperm.&lt;ref name="religions"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/dev.151886 |pmid=28720650 |title=The status of the human embryo in various religions |journal=Development |volume=144 |issue=14 |pages=2541–2543 |year=2017 |last1=Neaves |first1=William }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The human [[Egg cell|ova]] was first observed in 1827 by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]].&lt;ref name="discover" /&gt; Only in 1876 did [[Oscar Hertwig]] prove that fertilization is due to fusion of an egg and sperm cell.&lt;ref name="fertile" /&gt;

Many members of the medical community accept fertilization as the point at which life begins.  Dr. Bradley M. Patten from the [[University of Michigan]] wrote in ''Human Embryology'' that the union of the sperm and the ovum "initiates the life of a new individual" beginning "a new individual life history."  In the standard college [[text book]] ''Psychology and Life'', Dr. Floyd L. Ruch wrote "At the time of conception, two living germ cells—the sperm from the father and the egg, or ovum, from the mother—unite to produce a new individual."  Dr. Herbert Ratner wrote that "It is now of unquestionable certainty that a human being comes into existence precisely at the moment when the sperm combines with the egg."  This certain knowledge, Ratner says, comes from the study of [[genetics]].  At fertilization, all of the genetic characteristics, such as the color of the eyes, "are laid down determinatively."  James C. G. Conniff noted the prevalence of the above views in a study published by ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in which he wrote, "At that moment conception takes place and, scientists generally agree, a new life begins—silent, secret, unknown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rice, Charles |title=The Vanishing Right to Live|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. |location=Garden City, NY |year=1969 |pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view that life begins at fertilization reached acceptance from mainstream sources at one point.  In 1967, [[New York City Department of Education|New York City school]] officials launched a large [[sex education]] program.  The fifth grade textbook stated "Human life begins when the sperm cells of the father and the egg cells of the mother unite.  This union is referred to as fertilization.  For fertilization to take place and a baby to begin growing, the sperm cell must come in direct contact with the egg cell."  Similarly, a textbook used in [[Evanston, Illinois]] stated: "Life begins when a sperm cell and an ovum (egg cell) unite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rice, Charles |title=The Vanishing Right to Live|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. |location=Garden City, NY |year=1969 |pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Catholic philosopher [[Peter Kreeft]] goes so far as to say:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | author = Kreeft, Peter| title = Pro-Life Philosophy| date = March 2007 | url = http://www.peterkreeft.com/audio/19_prolife-philosophy/prolife-philosophy_transcription.htm |accessdate = 2009-04-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090409042718/http://www.peterkreeft.com/audio/19_prolife-philosophy/prolife-philosophy_transcription.htm| archivedate= 9 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, every biology textbook in the world, before ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', was not in doubt in answering the question, "When does an individual life of any mammalian species begin?" The answer is, "When the genetic code is complete." When instead of the haploid ovum and the haploid sperm, you get the diploid embryo. And at that point, something happens that is totally different, because the thing that's there seems totally different.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One objection raised to the fertilization view is that not all of the objects created by the union of a sperm and an egg are human beings. Objects such as [[hydatidiform mole]]s, [[choriocarcinoma]]s, and [[blighted ovum]]s are clearly not.  Neither will every normal zygote develop into an adult.  There are many fertilized eggs that never implant and are "simply washed away" after fertilization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nathanson, Bernard N. M.D. |author2=Ostling, Richard N. |title=Aborting America |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc |location=Garden City, NY |year=1979 |page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this can be answered by the fact that not every child becomes an adult; organisms die at various developmental stages. Therefore, within the fertilization view, these objects may be recognized as malformations of the fertilized sperm and egg. The indication of these objects itself seems to evidence the fact that they are aberrations from nature, rather than the norm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The unique genetic identity of the zygote is also challenged.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}  In fertilization, [[chromosome]]s from each parent are combined in the same cell nucleus but remain independent; every chromosome in a [[diploid]] cell can be traced to one parent and not the other. Only during meiosis, in which gametes are formed, do these chromosomes [[Chromosomal crossover|cross over]], exchanging bits of DNA to form unique genes not found in either parent, though this objection would also apply to the genome of an adult. However, gametes are not commonly considered to have personhood, perhaps because most of them are never involved in fertilization and are haploid cells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Biopsychologist Michael Gazzaniga has stated that an embryo or early fetus may be compared to a not-yet-constructed house:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You don't walk into a Home Depot and see thirty houses. You see materials that need architects, carpenters, electricians, and plumbers to create a house. An egg and a sperm are not a human. A fertilized embryo is not a human—it needs a uterus, and at least six months of gestation and development, growth and neuron formation, and cell duplication to become a human. To give an embryo created for biomedical research the same status even as one created for in vitro fertilization (IVF), let alone one created naturally, is patently absurd. When a Home Depot burns down, the headline in the paper is not "30 Houses Burn Down." It is "Home Depot Burned Down."&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, Michael S., "The Ethical Brain." Written July 1, 2005.  Accessed September 2, 2013. [http://www.dana.org/news/cerebrum/detail.aspx?id=774]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others have disputed this view. Law professor and ethicist Richard Stith has written that the proper word for the growth of a fetus is not construction, as of a house or car, but development, as of a (pre-digital-era) photograph or a tree sapling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Human beings do develop. To think they are constructed is flatly erroneous.... We know with certainty that quickening is an illusion, that the child is developing from the beginning, not being made from the outside, for its form lies within it, in its active potency, in its activated DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Stith, Richard, "Arguing with Pro-Choicers." Written November 4, 2006.  Accessed September 2, 2013. [http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2006/11/stith-arguing-with-pro-choicer]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That a human individual's existence begins at fertilization is the accepted position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], whose [[Pontifical Academy for Life]] declared: "The moment that marks the beginning of the existence of a new 'human being' is constituted by the penetration of sperm into the [[oocyte]]. Fertilization promotes a series of linked events and transforms the egg cell into a '[[zygote]]'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Declaration of the General Assembly XII|author=[[Pontifical Academy for Life]]|date=2006-03-22|accessdate=2009-07-27|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vatican.va%2Froman_curia%2Fpontifical_academies%2Facdlife%2Fdocuments%2Frc_pont-acd_life_doc_20060322_xii-gen-assembly-final_sp.html&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more authoritative [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] also has stated and reaffirmed: "From the time that the ovum is fertilized, a new life is begun which is neither that of the father nor of the mother; it is rather the life of a new human being with his own growth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19870222_respect-for-human-life_en.html Instruction on respect for human life in its origin and on the dignity of procreation: Replies to certain questions of the day], I, 1. The cited document adds: "The Magisterium has not expressly committed itself to an affirmation of a philosophical nature (on the moment of appearance of a spiritual soul) but it constantly reaffirms the moral condemnation of any kind of procured abortion."&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Orthodox churches and most of the more conservative Protestant denominations also teach this view of life.

=== Implantation ===
In his book ''[[Aborting America]],'' [[Bernard Nathanson]] argued that implantation should be considered the point at which life begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nathanson, Bernard N. M.D. |author2=Ostling, Richard N. |title=Aborting America |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc |location=Garden City, NY |year=1979 |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Biochemically, this is when alpha announces its presence as part of the human community by means of its hormonal messages, which we now have the technology to receive.  We also know biochemically that it is an independent organism distinct from the mother. [Note: in writing the book, "alpha" was Nathanson's term for any human before birth.]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In their book, ''When Does Human Life Begin?'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = When Does Human Life Begin?|last = Merritt, I &amp; II|first = John|publisher = Crystal Clear Books|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-985-36100-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; John L. Merritt, MD and his son J. Lawrence Meritt II, MD, present the idea that if "the breath of life" (Genesis 2:7) is oxygen, then a [[blastocyst]] starts taking in the breath of life from the mother's blood the moment it successfully implants in her womb, which is about a week after fertilization. If the end-point to human life is the moment the body stops using oxygen, then it may follow that the corresponding starting-point is the moment the body starts using oxygen.

=== Segmentation ===
Non-conjoined monozygotic twins form up to day 14 of embryonic development, but when twinning occurs after 14 days, the twins will likely be conjoined.&lt;ref name="twinning" /&gt;   Some argue that an early embryo cannot be a person because "If every person is an individual, one cannot be divided from oneself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bullough, Bonnie |author2=Bullough, Vern L. |title=Human sexuality: an encyclopedia |publisher=Garland Pub |location=New York |year=1994 |page=89 |isbn=978-0-8240-7972-7 |chapter=Catholic Attitudes Toward Sexuality:Abortion |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5HFtMkmFMYC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;source=web&amp;ots=qGTodkZOBi&amp;sig=UJmmHPr-RdUwERcSxlANfPnspbY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA89,M1 |accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Fr. Norman Ford stated that "the evidence would seem to indicate ''not'' that there is ''no'' individual at conception, but that there is at least one and possibly more."{{Citation needed|reason=Fr. Ford, in his 1988 book When Did I Begin?, was actually a famous proponent of the argument that embryos were NOT human individuals until reaching the stage where twinning is no longer possible.|date=June 2013}}  He went on to support the idea that, similar to processes found in other species, one twin could be the parent of the other [[asexual reproduction|asexual]]ly.  Theodore Hall agreed with the plausibility of this explanation saying, "We wonder if the biological process in twinning isn't simply another example of how nature reproduces from other individuals without destroying that person's or persons' individuality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rice, Charles |title=No Exception: A Pro-Life Imperative |publisher=Tyholland Press |location=Notre Dame, IN |year=1990 |pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain function (brain birth)===

In the years since the designation of brain death as a new criterion for death, attention has been directed towards the central role of the nervous system in a number of areas of ethical decision-making. The notion that there exists a neurological end-point to human life has led to efforts at defining a corresponding neurological starting-point. This latter quest has led to the concept of brain birth (or brain life), signifying the converse of [[brain death]]. The quest for a neurological marker of the beginning of human personhood owes its impetus to the perceived symmetry between processes at the beginning and end of life, thus if brain function is a criterion used to determine the medical death of a person, it should also be the criterion for its beginning.

Just as there are two types of brain death - whole brain death (which refers to the irreversible cessation of function of both the [[brain stem]] and higher parts of the brain) and higher brain death (destruction of the cerebral hemispheres alone, with possible retention of brain stem function), there are two types of brain birth (based on their reversal) - brain stem birth at the first appearance of brain waves in lower brain (brain stem) at 6–8 weeks of gestation, and higher brain birth, at the first appearance of brain waves in higher brain ([[cerebral cortex]]) at 22–24 weeks of gestation.&lt;ref name=Jones1998/&gt;

=== Fetal viability ===
{{AbortionLawsMap|size=350px}}
"Until the fetus is viable, any rights granted to it may come at the expense of the pregnant woman, simply because the fetus cannot survive except within the woman's body.  Upon viability, the pregnancy can be terminated, as by a [[c-section]] or [[induced labor]], with the fetus surviving to become a newborn infant.  Several groups believe that abortion before viability is acceptable, but is unacceptable after" is the perspective of Planned Parenthood, a major abortion provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/04/health/planned-parenthood-by-the-numbers/index.html|title=Planned Parenthood: Fast facts and revealing numbers|last=CNN|first=Debra Goldschmidt and Ashley Strickland,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.15585/mmwr.ss6624a1 |pmid=29166366 |title=Abortion Surveillance — United States, 2014 |journal=MMWR.

=== Birth===
While, at one end of the ideological spectrum, some believe human personhood begins at fertilization, at the other end of the spectrum others believe that as long as the fetus is still inside the body of the woman (whether it is viable or not), it does not have any rights of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rubenfeld |first1=Jed |title=On the Legal Status of the Proposition that 'Life Begins at Conception' |year=1991 |journal=Faculty Scholarship Series |volume=1568 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/1568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other markers==
There are also other ideas of when personhood is achieved:
* at [[ensoulment]]
* at "formation" – an early concept of bodily development (see [[Preformationism]]).
* at the emergence of consciousness
* at the emergence of rationality (see [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]])

Human personhood may also be seen as a work-in-progress, with the beginning being a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]] rather than a strict point in time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seminarianlifelink.org/articles/maritain.htm Human Being and Human Person: Jacques Maritain's Notion of the Person in the Contemporary Setting] Francesco E.M. Giordano, General Studies in the Humanities 345. The University of Chicago. Professor Bernard Schumacher, PhD. 15 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individuation===
Philosophers such as [[Aquinas]] use the concept of [[individuation]]. In regard to the [[abortion debate]], they argue that abortion is not permissible from the point at which individual human identity is realised. [[Anthony Kenny]] argues that this can be derived from everyday beliefs and language and one can legitimately say "if my mother had had an abortion six months into her pregnancy, she would have killed me" then one can reasonably infer that at six months the "me" in question would have been an existing person with a valid claim to life. Since division of the zygote into twins through the process of [[twins|monozygotic twinning]] can occur until the fourteenth day of pregnancy, Kenny argues that individual identity is obtained at this point and thus abortion is not permissible after two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kenny, Reason and Religion: Essays in Philosophical Theology (Oxford: Basil Blackwell), 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical perspectives==
The distinction in [[Value (ethics)|ethical value]] between existing persons and [[potential future person]]s has been questioned.&lt;ref name=hare1975p212-213&gt;Page 212 and 213 in: {{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = R. M. | year = 1975 | title = Abortion and the Golden Rule | journal = Philosophy and Public Affairs | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 201–222 | jstor=2265083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, it has been argued that contraception and even the decision not to procreate at all could be regarded as immoral on a similar basis as [[abortion]].&lt;ref name=warren1977&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warren | first1 = Mary Anne | year = 1977 | title = Do Potential People Have Moral Rights? | jstor = 40230690 | journal = Canadian Journal of Philosophy | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 275–289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, any marker of the beginning of human personhood doesn't necessarily mark where it is ethically right or wrong to assist or intervene. In a [[consequentialism|consequentialistic]] point of view, an assisting or intervening action may be regarded as basically equivalent whether it is performed before, during or after the creation of a human being, because the end result would basically be the same, that is, the existence or non-existence of that human being. In a view holding value in bringing potential persons into existence, it has been argued to be justified to perform abortion of an [[unintended pregnancy]] in favor for conceiving a new child later in better conditions.&lt;ref name=Savulescu2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savulescu | first1 = J | year = 2002 | title = Abortion, embryo destruction and the future of value argument | url = | journal = J Med Ethics | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 133–135 | doi = 10.1136/jme.28.3.133 | pmid = 12042393 | pmc = 1733572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal perspectives ==

===Ireland===
{{main|Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Abortion in the Republic of Ireland}}
The 1983 [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eight Amendment]] grants the full right to life, and personhood, to any "unborn". As such abortion is banned in nearly all cases, except to save the life of the mother. This was [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018|repealed]] on 25 May 2018 by a 66% voting margin.

===United States===
In its 1885 decision ''[[McArthur v. Scott]]'', the US Supreme Court affirmed the common law principle that a child in its mother's womb can be regarded as "in being" for the purpose of resolving a dispute about wills and trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=McArthur v. Scott  113 U.S. 340 (1885)|pages=113 U.S. 381–382|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/113/340/case.html|publisher=U.S. Supreme Court|quote=II. To come within the rule of the common law against perpetuities, the estate...must be one which...is to vest upon the happening of a contingency which may be possibility not take place within a life or lives in being (treating a child in its mother's womb as in being) and twenty-one years afterwards.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, [[Harry Blackmun]] wrote the court opinion for ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', saying "We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate."

In 2002, the [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act]] was enacted, which ensures that the legal concepts of ''person, baby, infant,'' and ''child'' include those which have been born alive in the course of a miscarriage or abortion, regardless of development, gestational age, or whether the placenta and umbilical cord are still attached.  This law makes no comment on personhood in utero but ensures that no person after birth is characterized as not a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Signs Born-Alive Infants Protection Act Remarks by the President in Signing of H.R. 2175, Born Alive Infants Protection Act|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/08/20020805-6.html|work=Office of the Press Secretary, George W.

In 2003, the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] was enacted, which prohibits an abortion if ''"either the entire baby's head is outside the body of the mother, or any part of the baby's trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 | publisher = National Right to Life | date = 2003-04-03 | url = http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/partial_birth_abortion_Ban_act_final_language.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081129195414/http://www.nrlc.org//abortion/pba/partial_birth_abortion_Ban_act_final_language.htm | archivedate = 29 November 2008 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;br/&gt;

In 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]] into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=18 U.S. CODE § 1841|first=U.S. Code|title=PROTECTION OF UNBORN CHILDREN|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1841|website=U.S. Code|publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law effectively extends personhood status&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1257&amp;context=crsj The Unborn Victims of Violence Act and its Impact on Reproductive Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; to a "''child in utero at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/abortion/unbornbill32504.html] Text of Unborn Victims of Violence Act.&lt;/ref&gt; if they are targeted, injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed violent crimes. The law also prohibits the prosecutions of "''any person for conduct relating''" to a legally consented to abortion.

Today, 38 U.S. States legally recognize a human fetus or "unborn child" as a crime victim, at least for the purpose of [[homicide]] or [[feticide]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx] "National Conference of State Legislatures - State Fetal Homicide Laws."&lt;/ref&gt; According to progressive media watchdog [[Media Matters for America]], "Further, a prenatal personhood measure might subject a woman who suffers a pregnancy-related complication or a miscarriage to criminal investigations and possibly jail time for homicide, manslaughter or reckless endangerment. And because so many laws use the terms "persons" or "people," a prenatal personhood measure could affect large numbers of a state's laws, changing the application of thousands of laws and resulting in unforeseeable, unintended, and absurd consequences." &lt;ref&gt;http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/04/09/wsj-ignores-extremist-personhood-implications-i/193551&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the 1992 [[United States Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' held that a law cannot place legal restrictions imposing an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] for "the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."&lt;ref&gt;Casey, 505 U.S. at 877.&lt;/ref&gt; This standard was also upheld in the Supreme Court case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'' (2016) in which several [[Texas]] restrictions were struck down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36641063|title=Strict Texas abortion law struck down|date=27 June 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive approaches to grammar''' are theories of [[grammar]] that relate grammar to mental processes and structures in [[human]] [[cognition]]. While Chomsky's theories of generative grammar are the most influential in most areas of [[linguistics]], other theories also deal with the cognitive aspects of grammar.

The approach of [[Noam Chomsky]] and his fellow [[generative grammar]]ians is that of an autonomous mental faculty that it is governed by mental processes operating on mental representations of different kinds of symbols that apply only within this faculty.

Another cognitive approach to grammar is that which is proposed by proponents of [[cognitive linguistics]], which holds that grammar is not an autonomous mental faculty with processes of its own, but that it is intertwined with all other cognitive processes and structures. The basic claim here is that ''grammar is conceptualization''. Some of the theories that fall within this paradigm are [[construction grammar]], [[cognitive grammar]], and [[word grammar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9318">{{About|a term used in the United States and the United Kingdom|the term used for an ethnic group in Southern Africa|Coloureds|other use|color (disambiguation)}} 
'''Colored''' is an ethnic descriptor historically used in the [[United States]] (predominantly during the [[Jim Crow]] era) and the [[United Kingdom]]. In the US, the term initially denoted non-"[[White people|white]]" individuals generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistical Abstract of the United States|date=1934|publisher=Department of the Treasury, United States|page=554|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LIZGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning was essentially the same in the UK, with "coloured" thus equivalent to "[[Person of color|people of colour]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Nicholas Deakin, Brian Cohen, Julia McNeal|title=Colour, citizenship and British society: based on the Institute of Race Relations report|date=1970|publisher=Panther Books|page=57|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=tZUJAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, usage of the appellation "colored" in the American South gradually came to be restricted to "[[negro]]es".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trigger|first1=Bruce G.|title=Northeast|date=1978|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|page=290|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=EX_hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Civil Rights Movement]], "colored" and "negro" gave way to "[[Black people|black]]" and (in the US) "[[African American]]". According to the [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary, the word ''colored'' was first used in the 14th century, but with a meaning other than race or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colored |title=Colored &amp;#124; Definition of Colored by Merriam-Webster |website=Merriam-webster.com |date=|accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other English-speaking countries, the term – often spelled '''coloured'''&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt; – has varied meanings. In [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], the term [[coloured]] (often capitalized) refers both to a specific ethnic group of complex mixed origins, which is considered neither black nor white, and in other contexts (usually lower case) to people of mixed race. In [[United Kingdom|British]] usage, the term refers to "a person who is wholly or partly of non-white descent" and its use may be regarded as antiquated or offensive,&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Is the word 'coloured' offensive?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6132672.stm|publisher=BBC News |work=Magazine|accessdate=August 18, 2012|date=November 9, 2006|quote=In times when commentators say the term is widely perceived as offensive, a Labour MP lost no time in condemning it "patronising and derogatory"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of coloured in English|work=Oxford Dictionaries|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/coloured |accessdate=18 August 2012|quote=In Britain it was the accepted term until the 1960s, when it was superseded (as in the US) by black. The term coloured lost favour among black people during this period and is now widely regarded as offensive except in historical contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other terms are preferable, particularly when referring to a single ethnicity.

In [[South Africa]], the term [[coloureds]] is used to describe people of a mixed parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=coloured|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/coloured?q=coloured|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus South Africa has people broadly classified as four races, namely Blacks, Whites, Coloureds and Indians.&lt;ref name="Posel2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.transformation.und.ac.za/issue%2047/47%20posel1.pdf |title= What’s in a name?

==United States==
In 1851, an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the "colored population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New York Times|page=3|date=September 18, 1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1863, the War Department established the [[Bureau of Colored Troops]].

The first twelve [[United States Census]] counts enumerated '"colored" people, who totaled nine million in 1900. The census counts of 1910–1960 enumerated "negroes".
NPR reported that the "use of the phrase "colored people" peaked in books published in 1970."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malesky|first1=Kee|title=The Journey From 'Colored' To 'Minorities' To 'People Of Color' Facebook Twitter Google+ Email|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/03/30/295931070/the-journey-from-colored-to-minorities-to-people-of-color|website=NPR|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"It's no disgrace to be colored," the black entertainer [[Bert Williams]] famously observed early in the century, "but it is awfully inconvenient."&lt;ref&gt;Neilly, Herbert L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lMF8I4oHGZEC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=williams+%22It%E2%80%99s+no+disgrace+to+be+colored%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VsfhbvP6KF&amp;sig=y0dXJuWvhDlL9wYqfSOJ0PN5hPw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LcTyUMqUL8PG0QGSiYHwCQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=williams%20%22It%E2%80%99s%20no%20disgrace%20to%20be%20colored%22&amp;f=false Black Pride: The Philosophy and Opinions of Black Nationalism: A Six-Volume History of Black Culture in Two Parts] AuthorHouse, 2005; {{ISBN|1418416657}}, page 237 (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Colored people lived in three neighborhoods that were clearly demarcated, as if by ropes or turnstiles", wrote Harvard professor [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] about growing up in [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] [[West Virginia]] in the 1960s. "Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said.... Of course, the colored world was not so much a neighborhood as a condition of existence."&lt;ref name="GrowingUp"&gt;Gates Jr, Henry Louis, [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/growing-colored Growing Up Colored], ''American Heritage Magazine'', Summer 2012, Volume 62, Issue 2&lt;/ref&gt; "For most of my childhood, we couldn't eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores", recalls Gates. His mother retaliated by not buying clothes that she was not allowed to try on. He remembered hearing a white man deliberately [[Society for the Prevention of Calling Sleeping Car Porters "George"|calling his father by the wrong name]]: "'He knows my name, boy,' my father said after a long pause. 'He calls all colored people George.'" When Gates's cousin became the first black cheerleader at the local high school, she was not allowed to sit with the team and drink Coke from a glass, but had to stand at the counter drinking from a paper cup.&lt;ref name="GrowingUp" /&gt; Professor Gates also wrote about his experiences in his 1995 book, ''Colored People: A Memoir''.&lt;ref&gt;Gates Jr, Henry Louis, ''Colored People: A Memoir'', (Vintage, 1995), {{ISBN|067973919X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, "colored" is generally regarded as an offensive term.&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Derogatory Racial Terms to Avoid in Public |url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/understandingrac1/a/racialnamestoavoid_2.htm |website=racerelations.about.com |publisher=About.com |accessdate=14 February 2015 |quote=Some people may think it's okay to simply shorten that phrase ["people of color"] to "colored," but they're mistaken. Like "Oriental," "colored" harkens back to an era of exclusion, a time when Jim Crow was in full force, and blacks used water fountains marked "colored" and sat in the "colored" sections of busses, beaches and restaurants. In essence, the term stirs up painful memories. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term lives on in the name of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], generally called the NAACP.&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt; In 2008, its communications director Carla Sims said "the term 'colored' is not derogatory, [the NAACP] chose the word 'colored' because it was the most positive description commonly used [in 1909, when the association was founded]. It's outdated and antiquated but not offensive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2008/11/12/lohan-calls-obama-colored-naacp-says-no-big-deal#ftnb|title = Lohan calls Obama ‘colored’, NAACP says no big deal|publisher = Mercury News|date=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary English today the term "people of colour" is considered more acceptable than coloured and is much more frequently used in everyday conversation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2648">'''Comparative law wikis''' are [[wiki]]s that allow users to create empirical cross-reference datasets for the analysis of the world's myriad [[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]. Wikis are adaptable to use by any cross-geographical comparative study, such as [[comparative politics]], [[comparative religion]].

==Examples==

Over the past decade, there have been several attempts to create a global legal wiki,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ler.edu.au/pdf/vol19_fullpapers/ler_vol19_paper3.pdf|title=Normann Witzleb, Engaging with the World: Students of Comparative Law Write for Wikipedia|publisher=Legal Education Review (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt; though as of April 2017 none have gained primacy.  Examples include the World Encyclopedia of Law, by LAWi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawin.org/comparative-law/|title=World Encyclopedia of Law|publisher=LAWi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wex]], the online legal encyclopedia created by [[Cornell Law School]]'s [[Legal Information Institute]]. Parallel efforts to create crowdsourced data structures to map global legal/regulatory authorities include projects like [[Intellipedia]], an online system for collaborative data sharing used by the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (IC).

== Usefulness ==

Comparative law wikis are an efficient method of performing [[comparative law|comparative legal]] analysis.  Wikis are particularly useful for comparative global analysis because of the use with which sources from multiple jurisdictions can be gathered in one place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=Dennis|last2=Mighell|first2=Tom|title=Wikis for the Legal Profession|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/lpm/lpt/articles/slc02071.shtml|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=12 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911023153/http://apps.americanbar.org/lpm/lpt/articles/slc02071.shtml|archivedate=11 April 2014|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crowdsourcing]] permits gathering up-to-date legal authorities from contributors who have local expertise, particularly knowledge of languages and administrative structures that background implementation of particular legal/regulatory norms.  

Comparative law wikis can also be useful for comparative study in federal legal systems, such as in the U.S., where 50-state law surveys are particularly useful.

The '''Dakota Access Pipeline protests''', also known by the [[hashtag]] '''#[[NODAPL]]''', are [[grassroots|grassroots movements]] that began in early 2016 in reaction to the approved construction of [[Energy Transfer Partners]]' [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] in the northern United States. The pipeline was projected to run from the [[Bakken Formation|Bakken oil fields]] in western North Dakota to southern Illinois, crossing beneath the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers, as well as under part of [[Lake Oahe]] near the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]]. Many in the Standing Rock tribe considered the pipeline and its intended crossing of the Missouri River to constitute a threat to the region's clean water and to ancient burial grounds. In April 2016, Standing Rock Sioux elder [[LaDonna Brave Bull Allard]] established a camp as a center for cultural preservation and spiritual resistance to the pipeline; over the summer the camp grew to thousands of people.  The protests drew considerable  national and international attention and have been said to be "reshaping the national conversation for any environmental project that would cross the Native American land."&lt;ref name="BusinessInsider-ThousandsGather-2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/photos-north-dakota-pipeline-protest-2016-9/#while-members-of-the-standing-rock-sioux-tribes-began-protesting-the-project-as-early-as-april-protests-heated-up-in-august-as-numbers-increased-to-the-thousands-1|title=Thousands of protesters are gathering in North Dakota — and it could lead to 'nationwide reform'|date=September 13, 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|last1=Liu|first1=Louise|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] had conducted a limited review of the route and found no significant impact, but in March and April 2016 the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]], and the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] asked the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a formal [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] and issue an Environmental Impact Statement. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed suit against the Corps of Engineers in July, but the motion was denied.  In December, under [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama's]] administration the Corps of Engineers denied an easement for construction of the pipeline under the Missouri River. An environmental impact assessment was to be conducted by the Army Corps, but many protesters continued camping on the site, not considering the matter closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/|title=Rolling Stone|publisher=|accessdate=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://standwithstandingrock.net/standing-rock-sioux-tribes-statement-u-s-army-corps-engineers-decision-not-grant-easement/|title=Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's Statement on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Decision to Not Grant Easement|date=December 4, 2016|newspaper=Stand With Standing Rock|language=en-US|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/04/politics/dakota-access-pipeline/|title=Dakota Access Pipeline to be rerouted |date=December 4, 2016|newspaper=[[CNN]]|language=en-US|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, 2017, newly elected President [[Donald Trump]] signed an executive order that reversed the Obama legislation and  advanced the construction of the pipeline under "terms and conditions to be negotiated, " expediting the environmental review that Trump described as an "incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process."&lt;ref name="Mufson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mufson |first=Steven |date=January 24, 2017 |title= Trump gives green light to dakota access keystone xl oil pipelines|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/24/trump-gives-green-light-to-dakota-access-keystone-xl-oil-pipelines/ |newspaper=Washington Post |location=Washington, DC |access-date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg240117&gt;

Several acts of violence used on protesters gained a great deal of media attention.  In September 2016, construction workers bulldozed a section of land the tribe had identified as sacred ground and when protesters entered the area security workers used [[attack dog]]s which bit at least six of the protesters and one horse. The incident was filmed and viewed by several million people on [[YouTube]] and other social media. In October, armed soldiers and police with [[riot gear]] and military equipment cleared an encampment that was directly in the proposed pipeline's path.  In November, police use of water cannons on protesters in freezing weather drew significant media attention. 

During the protest numerous high profile activists and Congressional Democrats spoke out for the rights of the tribe. 
Senator Bernie Sanders actively supported the movement and President Obama spoke with tribal leaders and offered his support.  Standing Rock Chairman [[David Archambault II]], arrested and strip searched himself while protesting, gave numerous interviews explaining the tribe's positions; he also addressed the tribe's positions at the  [[UN Human Rights Council]] in Geneva, Switzerland.

The Dakota Access Pipeline, a part of the Bakken pipeline project, is a {{convert|1172|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} underground [[oil pipeline]] project in the United States. The pipeline was planned by Dakota Access, LLC, a subsidiary of the [[Dallas, Texas]] corporation [[Energy Transfer Partners]], L.P. It begins in the [[Bakken formation|Bakken]] oil fields in Northwest [[North Dakota]] and travels in a more or less straight line southeast, through [[South Dakota]] and [[Iowa]], ending at the [[oil terminal]] near [[Patoka, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="pc814"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/2014/08/22/farmers-make-way-bakken-pipeline/14426829/|title=Should farmers make way for the Bakken pipeline?|date=August 25, 2014|work=Press Citizen|author1=William Petroski|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ames&gt;{{cite news|url= http://amestrib.com/news/energy-transfer-phillips-66-partner-iowa-pipeline#sthash.HxSouvkE.dpuf| title=Energy Transfer, Phillips 66 partner on Iowa pipeline|work=Ames Tribune|author=Gavin Aronsen|date=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to court records, the pipeline was due for delivery on January 1, 2017.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pipeline-nativeamericans-hearing-idUSKCN12529S|title=Federal appeals court hears arguments over Dakota Access pipeline|author=Harte, Julia|date=October 5, 2016|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Routing the pipeline across the Missouri River near [[Bismark, North Dakota|Bismarck]] was rejected because of the route's proximity to municipal water sources; residential areas; and road, wetland, and waterway crossings. The Bismarck route would also have been 11 miles (18&amp;nbsp;km) longer.&lt;ref name="Dalrymple2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=Amy|title=Pipeline route plan first called for crossing north of Bismarck|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/pipeline-route-plan-first-called-for-crossing-north-of-bismarck/article_64d053e4-8a1a-5198-a1dd-498d386c933c.html|publisher=The Bismark Tribune|date=August 18, 2016|accessdate=September 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101185338/http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/pipeline-route-plan-first-called-for-crossing-north-of-bismarck/article_64d053e4-8a1a-5198-a1dd-498d386c933c.html|archive-date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The alternative selected by the Corps of Engineers crossed underneath the Missouri River half a mile (800 m) from the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]]. A spill could have major adverse effects on the waters that the Tribe and individuals in the area rely upon.&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-pipeline-fight-and-americas-dark-past | title=A Pipeline Fight and America's Dark Past | publisher=The New Yorker | date=September 6, 2016 | accessdate=October 25, 2016 | author=McKibben, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a permit process that treated the pipeline as a series of small construction sites, the pipeline was granted an exemption from the environmental review required by the [[Clean Water Act]] and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]].&lt;ref name="Common Dreams (Bill Moyers)"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/09/09/what-you-need-know-about-dakota-access-pipeline-protest | title=What You Need to Know About the Dakota Access Pipeline Protest | publisher=Common Dreams | date=September 9, 2016 | accessdate=October 26, 2016 | author=Moyers, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, citing potential effects on the Native tribes, most notably the [[Standing Rock Sioux]], in March and April 2016 the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]] (DOI), and the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] asked the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] to conduct a formal [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] and issue an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

Noting that the water system serving [[Fort Yates, North Dakota|Fort Yates]] on the Standing Rock Reservation was only 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) downstream of where the pipeline would cross [[Lake Oahe]] and the [[Missouri River]], the EPA recommended that the Army Corps revise its Environmental Assessment and open up a second public comment period. "Based on our improved understanding of the project setting, we also recommend addressing additional concerns regarding environmental justice and emergency response actions to spills/leaks."&lt;ref name="IndianCountry-FederalAgencies-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=ICTMN Staff|title=Dakota Access Pipeline: Three Federal Agencies Side With Standing Rock Sioux, Demand Review|url=https://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/04/27/dakota-access-pipeline-three-federal-agencies-side-standing-rock-sioux-demand-review|accessdate=August 6, 2016|work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOI also expressed concerns about the pipeline's proximity to the tribe's water source:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The routing of a 12- to 30-inch crude oil pipeline in close proximity to and upstream of the Reservation is of serious concern to the Department.  When establishing the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's permanent homeland, the U.S. reserved waters of sufficient quantity and quality to serve the purposes of the Reservation. The Department holds more than 800,000 acres of land in trust for the Tribe that could be impacted by a leak or spill. Further, a spill could impact the waters that the Tribe and individual tribal members residing in that area rely upon for drinking and other purposes. We believe that, if the pipeline's current route along the edge of the Reservation remains an option, the potential impact on trust resources in this particular situation necessitates full analysis and disclosure of potential impacts through the preparation of an [Environmental Impact Statement].&lt;ref name="IndianCountry-FederalAgencies-2016" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of September 2016, the [[United States Department of Justice]] had received more than 33,000 petitions to review all permits and order a full review of the project's environmental effects.&lt;ref name="ri916"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radioiowa.com/2016/09/15/bakken-pipeline-opposition-presents-petitions-to-u-s-justice-department/ | title=Bakken pipeline opposition presents petitions to U.S. Justice Department | publisher=Radio Iowa | date=September 15, 2016 | accessdate=September 25, 2016 | author=Michael Leland, Iowa Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the 380 archaeological sites that face desecration along the entire pipeline route, from North Dakota to Illinois, 26 of them are right here at the confluence of these two rivers. It is a historic trading ground, a place held sacred not only by the Sioux Nations, but also the [[Arikara]], the [[Mandan]], and the [[Northern Cheyenne]]...&lt;br /&gt;
The U.S. government is wiping out our most important cultural and spiritual areas. And as it erases our footprint from the world, it erases us as a people. These sites must be protected, or our world will end, it is that simple. Our young people have a right to know who they are. They have a right to language, to culture, to tradition. The way they learn these things is through connection to our lands and our history.&lt;br /&gt;
If we allow an oil company to dig through and destroy our histories, our ancestors, our hearts and souls as a people, is that not genocide?&lt;ref name="Yes! Magazine" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By late September NBC News reported that members of more than 300 [[Federally recognized tribe|federally recognized Native American tribes]] were residing in the three main camps, alongside an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 pipeline resistance supporters. Several thousand more gathered at the camps on weekends.&lt;ref name="BusinessInsider-ThousandsGather-2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ICT-Gray-Sep8-16"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/09/08/standing-rock-biggest-story-no-ones-covering|title=Standing Rock: The Biggest Story That No One's Covering|date=September 8, 2016|work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|last1=Gray|first1=Jim|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC News1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dakota-pipeline-company-buys-ranch-near-sioux-protest-site-records-n653051 | title=Dakota Pipeline Company Buys Ranch Near Sioux Protest Site, Records Show | publisher=NBC News | date=September 23, 2016 | accessdate=September 24, 2016 | author=Medina, Daniel A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As winter approached numbers grew lower, but the protesters winterized and prepared for an indefinite stay.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The role of Indigenous young women coming together in this campaign has also been paramount, signaling the enduring strength of Indigenous women's leadership in questions of tribal governance. Women were the people who held the tribe together and they were the willpower of the tribe and its strength.

=== The International Indigenous Youth Council ===

The International Indigenous Youth Council has also been active in protests against the pipeline and advocacy for Native American needs.  
The group was founded by Jaslyn Charger (Cheyenne River Sioux of Eagle Butte, South Dakota).  Tara Houska (Ojibwe, Couchiching First Nation of International Falls, Minnesota), national campaigns director of Honor the Earth, has actively helped to explain the protest aims.  Eryn Wise (Jicarilla Apache and Laguna tribes), Council communications director, hopes to relate history from the Indigenous people's point of view:   "We don't ever hear the narrative of indigenous people.  We hear people writing our narratives for us."

In September 2014, Standing Rock Sioux Tribal (SRST) Councilman [[David Archambault II]] conducted an initial informational meeting between the SRST and Dakota Access Pipeline representatives. At the beginning of the meeting, Archambault indicated the tribe's opposition to the project within treaty boundaries, stating, "So just that you know: this is something that the tribe is not supporting." Additional SRST representatives voiced opposition and concerns about the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XARJFdyyfac|title=Sept 30th DAPL meeting with SRST|date=September 30, 2014|website=youtube|publisher=Standing Rock Sioux Tribe|quote=from 5:48 (evocation of treaty boundaries: Fort Laramie Treaties (1851 and 1868) and standing resolution from 2012).

Pipeline protests were reported as early as October 2014, when Iowa community and environmental activists presented 2,300 petitions to Iowa Governor [[Terry Branstad]] asking him to sign a state [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] to stop it.&lt;ref name="The Des Moines Register"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-politics-insider/2014/10/14/branstad-wont-stop-iowa-bakken-oil-pipeline/17246713/ | title=Branstad won't stop Bakken oil pipeline through Iowa | publisher=The Des Moines Register | date=October 14, 2014 | accessdate=November 5, 2016 | author=Petroski, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voicing concerns for damage to wildlife habitat and sacred sites, the Sac &amp; Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa ([[Meskwaki]] Nation) also objected to the route and formally lodged their opposition in early 2015.&lt;ref name="Indian Country Today"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/03/16/meskwaki-nation-opposes-new-pipeline-threat-could-rival-keystone-xl-159631 | title=Meskwaki Nation Opposes New Pipeline Threat That Could Rival Keystone| publisher=ICTMW | date=March 16, 2015 | accessdate=November 5, 2016 | author=staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal members were also among those who opposed the [[Keystone XL pipeline]].&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/03/16/meskwaki-tribe-opposes-bakken-pipeline/24834269/|title=Meskwaki tribe opposes Bakken oil pipeline through Iowa|date=March 16, 2015|work=USA Today|author1=William Petroski|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to the Iowa Utilities Board, Tribal chairwoman Judith Bender wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a people that have lived in North America for thousands of years, we have environmental concerns about the land and drinking water...Our main concern is Iowa's aquifers might be significantly damaged. And it will only take one mistake and life in Iowa will change for the next thousands of years. We think that should be protected, because it is the water that gives Iowa the best way of life.&lt;ref name="Indian Country Today"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The tribe sued for an injunction on the grounds that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had failed to conduct a proper environmental and cultural impact study. Protests had escalated at the pipeline site in North Dakota, with numbers swelling from just a bare handful of people to hundreds and then thousands over the summer.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Rising"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indigenousrising.org/coalition-support-of-tribal-lawsuits-against-us-army-corps-permits-for-the-dakota-access-pipeline/ | title=Coalition Support of Tribal Lawsuits Against US Army Corps Permits for the Dakota Access Pipeline | publisher=Indigenous Rising | date=September 3, 2016 | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Standing Rock Sioux tribe believes that the pipeline would put the Missouri River, the water source for the reservation, at risk. They pointed out two recent spills, [[Kalamazoo River oil spill|a 2010 pipeline spill into the Kalamazoo River]] in Michigan, which cost over  billion to clean up with significant contamination remaining, and a 2015 [[2015 Yellowstone River oil spill|Bakken crude oil spill into the Yellowstone River]] in Montana.&lt;ref name="GrandForksHerald-StandingRockSues-2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="People-Pipeline-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=Tiare|title=These Native American Youths Are Running 2,000 Miles to Protect Their Water|url=http://www.people.com/article/rezpect-our-water-native-american-youths-run-2000-miles-protest|accessdate=August 6, 2016|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DesMoinesRegister-Pipeline-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacPherson|first1=James|title=Standing Rock Sioux sues Corps over Bakken pipeline permits|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2016/07/30/bakken-pipeline-standing-rock-sioux-sues-army-corps/87797606/|accessdate=August 6, 2016|work=[[The Des Moines Register]]|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribe was also concerned that the pipeline route may run through sacred Sioux sites.

===Security firm use of dogs and pepper spray against protesters===
On September 3, 2016, during [[Labor Day]] weekend, the Dakota Access Pipeline brought in a private security firm when the company used bulldozers to dig up part of the pipeline route that contained possible Native graves and burial artifacts; it was subject to a pending injunction motion. The bulldozers arrived within a day after the tribe filed legal action.&lt;ref name="CommonDreams-Genocide-2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/09/05/not-genocide-pipeline-co-bulldozing-burial-sites-prompts-emergency-motion|title='Is That Not Genocide?'

When unarmed protesters crossed the perimeter fence to stop the bulldozers, the guards used pepper spray and guard dogs to attack.  At least six protesters were treated for dog bites, and an estimated 30 were pepper-sprayed before the guards and their dogs left the scene in trucks. A woman that had taken part in the incident stated, "The cops watched the whole thing from up on the hills. It felt like they were trying to provoke us into being violent when we're peaceful."&lt;ref name="Manning"/&gt; The incident was filmed by [[Amy Goodman]] and a crew from ''Democracy Now!''&lt;ref name="DN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dakota Access Pipeline Company Attacks Native American Protesters with Dogs &amp; Pepper Spray|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuZcx2zEo4k}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage shows several people with dog bites and a dog with blood on its muzzle.&lt;ref name="Manning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levin|first1=Sam|title=North Dakota arrest warrant for Amy Goodman raises fears for press freedom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/amy-goodman-arrest-warrant-north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest|website=Guardian|accessdate=September 17, 2016|date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Naureckas|first1=Jim|title=Colleagues Mostly Fail to Rally for Amy Goodman, Threatened With Jail for Journalism|url=http://fair.org/home/colleagues-mostly-fail-to-rally-for-amy-goodman-threatened-with-jail-for-journalism/|website=fair.org|publisher=Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|accessdate=September 17, 2016|date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frost Kennels of Hartville, Ohio, acknowledged that they were involved in the incident on September 3.&lt;ref name="DuluthNewsTribune-Criticism-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalrymple|first1=Amy|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/4109496-use-dogs-north-dakota-pipeline-protest-criticized | title=Dakota pipeline protest criticized|work=[[Duluth News Tribune]]|date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive director for Private Investigator Security Guard Services Geoff Dutton said Frost Kennels and its owner, Bob Frost, were not licensed by the state of Ohio to provide security services or guard dogs. [[Morton County, North Dakota|Morton County]] Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said they were investigating both sides in the incident, including wounds inflicted by the dogs, and that they had no prior knowledge of the use of dogs until a [[9-1-1]] call was made. When asked why the deputies who witnessed the incident did not intervene, Kirchmeier cited officer security concerns,&lt;ref name="DuluthNewsTribune-Criticism-2016" /&gt; and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any suggestion that today's event was a peaceful protest is false. This was more like a riot than a protest. Individuals crossed onto private property and accosted private security officers with wooden posts and flag poles. The aggression and violence displayed here today is unlawful and should not be repeated. While no arrests were made at the scene, we are actively investigating the incident and individuals who organized and participated in this unlawful event.&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kfyrtv.com/content/news/Law-enforcement-issues-statement-on-Dakota-Access-Pipeline-protest-392267271.html | title=Law enforcement issues statement on Dakota Access Pipeline protest | publisher=Fox News | date=September 3, 2016 | accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After viewing footage of the attack, a law enforcement consultant who trains police dogs called it "absolutely appalling" and "reprehensible". "Taking bite dogs and putting them at the end of a leash to intimidate, threaten and prevent crime is not appropriate."&lt;ref name="DuluthNewsTribune-Criticism-2016" /&gt; A former K-9 officer for the Grand Forks Police Department who now owns a security firm that uses dogs for drug detection said, "It reminded me of the [[civil rights movement]] back in the '60s. I didn't think it was appropriate. They were overwhelmed and it just wasn't proper use of the dogs."&lt;ref name="DuluthNewsTribune-Criticism-2016" /&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of North Dakota spoke out against the use of dogs and pepper spray and asked that the state officials "treat everyone fairly and equally."&lt;ref name="DuluthNewsTribune-Criticism-2016" /&gt; Speaking on September 4, [[Ojibwe]] activist and former [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] candidate [[Winona LaDuke]] said, "North Dakota regulators are really, I would say, in bed with the oil industry and so they have looked the other way."&lt;ref name="DN" /&gt;

=== High-profile arrests  ===
On August 11–12, 18 people were arrested, including Standing Rock Tribal Chairman [[David Archambault II]] who was charged with disorderly conduct. Along with the tribal council, Archambault had sued the Army Corps of Engineers days before his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donovan|first1=Lauren|title=Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault arrested at Dakota Access Pipeline protest|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/standing-rock-sioux-chairman-dave-archambault-arrested-at-dakota-access/article_fb12da36-3e84-5694-8eba-000013930cb2.html|website=Bismarck Tribune|accessdate=November 3, 2016|date=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was himself sued on August 16 by Dakota Access, LLC, which sought "restraining orders and unspecified monetary damages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacPherson|first1=James|title=Dakota Access pipeline owners sue North Dakota protesters|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d4f1627631bf44df9cc52853f09f4256/dakota-access-pipeline-owners-sue-north-dakota-protesters|website=Big Story|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=November 3, 2016|date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7 an arrest warrant was also issued in Morton County for Green Party presidential candidate [[Jill Stein]] and her running mate [[Ajamu Baraka]] on misdemeanor counts of criminal trespass and criminal mischief. Stein had spray-painted "I approve this message" and Baraka wrote the word "decolonize" on a bulldozer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dennis J Bernstein|title=Green Party Candidates Face Arrest: An Interview with Green Party VP Candidate Ajamu Baraka|url=http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/39068-focus-green-party-candidates-face-arrest-an-interview-with-green-party-vp-candidate-ajamu-baraka|publisher=reader supported news|date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A warrant for journalist Amy Goodman's arrest was issued by Morton County on September 8.  She was charged with criminal trespass related to the filming done on September 3.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting"/&gt; The prosecutor, Ladd Erickson, said Goodman was like a protester because she was only giving time to the protesters' side of the story.&lt;ref name="Bismark Tribune"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/democracy-now-reporter-to-return-to-state-to-face-charges/article_644cb3c1-ae67-552a-bed8-9c6e171f3565.html | title=Democracy Now reporter to return to state to face charges | publisher=Bismark Tribune | date=October 11, 2016 | accessdate=October 20, 2016 | author=Grueskin, Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to praise from Erickson, [[Matt Taibbi]] wrote, "a prosecutor who arrests a reporter because he doesn't think she's 'balanced' enough is basically telling future reporters what needs to be in their stories to avoid arrest.

On October 1, Canadian journalist Ed Ou, on assignment with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to cover the protests, was detained at the US border for six hours, with his cell phones and other electronic media confiscated. Ou was eventually denied entry to the US without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian photojournalist detained for hours, refused entry to U.S. | date=November 30, 2016 | url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.3874554/canadian-photojournalist-detained-for-hours-refused-entry-to-u-s-1.3874563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Civil Liberties Union requested that any data collected from Ou's electronic devices be destroyed and that he be given assurance that he would not be harassed again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/u-s-border-agents-stopped-canadian-journalist-from-entry-and-confiscated-his-phones-without-a-warrant|title=U.S. border agents stopped Canadian journalist from entry and confiscated his phones without a warrant|publisher=|accessdate=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on October 5, Standing Rock Tribal Chairman David Archambault II said that as of that date 135 anti-pipeline demonstrators had been arrested. Archambault also said that law enforcement officers were "heightening the danger" by using [[Riot police|anti-riot gear]].&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; Saying, "Confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response", [[Amnesty International]]  also expressed concern about the militant response to the protesters.&lt;ref name="amnestyusa.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/amnesty-international-usa-to-monitor-to-north-dakota-pipeline-protests|title=Amnesty International USA to Monitor to North Dakota Pipeline Protests|website=Amnesty International USA|access-date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, Goodman announced her intention to turn herself in to the Morton County–Mandan Corrections Center on Monday, October 17, to face misdemeanor riot charges. (Though she had originally been charged with criminal trespass, the prosecutor said that there were "legal issues with proving the notice of trespassing requirements in the statute.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ratner|first1=Lizzy|title=Amy Goodman Is Facing Prison for Reporting on the Dakota Access Pipeline.

On October 17, District Judge John Grinsteiner did not find probable cause for multiple riot charges, including the one brought against Goodman. Following the judge's decision, Kirchmeier reasserted that trespassing would lead to arrest, while the state prosecutor said that the investigation would remain open pending new evidence.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now!

=== Evidence of harsh treatment ===

As of mid-October, there had been over 140 arrests.  Some protesters who were arrested for [[misdemeanors]] and taken to the Morton County jail reported what they considered harsh and unusual treatment. Sara Jumping Eagle, a physician on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, was required to [[strip search|remove all of her clothing]] and "[[Body cavity search|squat and cough]]"  when she was arrested for [[disorderly conduct]]. In another such case, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, who founded Sacred Stone Camp, said that when her daughter was arrested and taken into custody she was "strip-searched in front of multiple male officers, then left for hours in her cell, naked and freezing." Cody Hall from [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation|Cheyenne River Reservation]] in South Dakota also reported being strip-searched. He was held for four days without bail or bond and then charged with two misdemeanors.&lt;ref name="DemocracyNow-ProtestersStripSearched-2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/10/17/dakota_excess_pipeline_standing_rock_protectors|title=Dakota Excess Pipeline?

Actress [[Shailene Woodley]], arrested on October 10 along with 27 others, also said she was strip-searched, adding, "Never did it cross my mind that while trying to protect clean water, trying to ensure a future where our children have access to an element essential for human survival, would I be strip-searched.

They sent a delegation of human rights observers to monitor law enforcement's response to the protests.&lt;ref name="amnestyusa.org" /&gt;

On October 27, police from several agencies, including North Dakota state troopers, the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], and other law enforcement agencies from surrounding states, began an intensive operation to clear out a protest camp and blockades along [[North Dakota Highway 1806|Highway 1806]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-arrests-pepper-spray|title=North Dakota pipeline: 141 arrests as protesters pushed back from site|last=Levin|first=Sam|date=October 28, 2016|last2=Woolf|first2=Nicky|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Carrington|first3=Damian|access-date=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Morton County Sheriff's Department said in a statement: "Protesters' escalated unlawful behavior this weekend by setting up illegal roadblocks, trespassing onto private property and establishing an encampment, has forced law enforcement to respond at this time. I can't stress it enough, this is a public safety issue. We cannot have protesters blocking county roads, blocking state highways, or trespassing on private property."&lt;ref name="NBC News" /&gt;

A ''Seattle Times'' journalist present at the confrontation described it as "scary". On the ''[[PBS Newshour]]'', she said that she had spent the previous night in the camp "with tribal members who were singing their death songs. I mean, they were very worried about the possibility of violence. And who wouldn't be? You have seen law enforcement marshaled from six states, armored personnel carriers, hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement officers with concussion grenades, mace, Tasers, batons. And they used all of it. I mean, it was frightening to watch." She said that the confrontation ended the following day and said, "the law enforcement officers had advance[d] more than 100 yards with five armored personnel carriers side by side, hundreds of law enforcement officers advancing on them. And it finally took an elder to actually walk by himself in between the two lines, stand there, face his people, and say: 'Go home. We're here to fight the pipeline, not these people, and we can only win this with prayer.'"&lt;ref name="PBS Newshour"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/tensions-escalating-dakota-access-pipeline-standoff-obama-suggests-reroute/ | title=Tensions escalating in Dakota Access pipeline standoff, Obama suggests reroute | publisher=PBS Newshour | date=November 2, 2016 | accessdate=November 3, 2016 | author=PBS staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/governor-issues-emergency-declaration-in-response-to-pipeline-protests/article_6b189499-0d39-5223-93a4-5f10e53e735c.html|title=Governor issues emergency declaration in response to pipeline protests|author=Caroline Grueskin|newspaper=Bismarck Tribune|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unicornriot.ninja/?p=10476|title=Police &amp; Military Attack Oceti Sakowin Treaty Camp - UNICORN RIOT|date=October 27, 2016|newspaper=UNICORN RIOT|language=en-US|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37790839|title=Riot police move in on North Dakota pipeline protesters|date=October 28, 2016|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the confrontation, on October 28 Amnesty International published a press release saying in part: "These people should not be treated like the enemy. Police must keep the peace using minimal force appropriate to the situation. Confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response. Under International law and standards, arrests should not be used to intimidate or prevent people from participating in peaceful assembly."&lt;ref name="amnestyusa.org"/&gt;

===Protesters move to clear blocked bridge and police respond===

On the evening of November 20, protesters attempted to open Backwater Bridge on Highway 1806, which had been blocked since October 27. The bridge is about a mile (1600 m) south of where the pipeline developer plans to drill. According to the sheriff's department, the bridge was closed for safety reasons "due to damage caused after protesters set numerous fires" on it on October 27. But the protesters believe that the police used the closure to "lock [them] in" and  that the closure blocked access for emergency vehicles coming from the north.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/us/dakota-access-pipeline-protests/index.html|title=Dakota Access Pipeline clashes turn violent|first=Madison Park and Mayra Cuevas|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to news reports, the police launched an attack on the protesters with water cannons in {{convert|28|F|C}} weather, along with teargas, rubber bullets, and concussion grenades, injuring hundreds.&lt;ref name="GuardianNov2016"&gt;{{cite web|author=Julia Carrie Wong|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/21/dakota-access-pipeline-water-cannon-police-standing-rock-protest|title=Dakota Access pipeline: 300 protesters injured after police use water cannons|publisher=The Guardian|date=November 21, 2016|access-date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police said the protesters had been "very aggressive" and that the water was used to put out multiple fires they had set, while the protesters said the fires were peaceful bonfires used to keep warm.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A number of videos posted on social media show protesters being doused with continuous streams of water. Initially the Morton County Sheriff's Office said the water was used only to put out fires, but the following day Sheriff Kirchmeier corrected that statement, saying, "Some of the water was used to repel some of the protest activities" and adding that it was "sprayed more as a mist and we didn't want to get it directly on them but we wanted to make sure to use it as a measure to keep everybody safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/dakota-pipeline-protests/pipeline-protesters-decry-excessive-force-after-woman-s-arm-blown-n687326|title=Pipeline protesters decry police tactics after woman's arm 'blown out'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman's arm was seriously injured by an explosion that protesters claimed was part of a concussion grenade but which police suggest may have been an exploding propane canister.

By December the protest camp had dwindled to a few hundred people due to the construction work stoppage and harsh winter weather. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault called for the camp to disband because of the weather and the possibility of contamination of the river with garbage and debris during the spring flood. He asked people to clean up the area and to leave.&lt;ref name="ap090117"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.yahoo.com/news/corps-tribes-judge-reject-dakota-access-company-request-171830774.html | title = Corps, tribes to judge: Reject Dakota Access company request | agency = The Associated Press | date = January 9, 2017 | accessdate = January 10, 2017 | first = Blake | last = Nicholson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, it was reported that the cost of policing the pipeline protests in North Dakota had surpassed $22&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=ap100117&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, amid concerns that warmer weather would accelerate flooding of the area, removal of garbage and debris from the campsite began to prevent the contamination of the river. Archambault indicated that funds from the $6 million in donations the tribe received to support its fight would be used to clean up the  garbage, building material and human waste at the camp. The tribe began coordinating cleanup of the site in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/feb/15/north-dakota-feds-address-garbage-left-at-pipeline/|title=North Dakota, feds address garbage left at pipeline protest camp|work=Spokesman.com|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers''==
[[File:Lake Oahe, SD, winter.jpg|thumb|Lake Oahe in winter]]
On July 27, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], seeking [[Declaratory judgment|declaratory]] and [[Injunction|injunctive]] relief to stop the pipeline. The tribe also sought a [[preliminary injunction]].&lt;ref name="InjunctiveRelief-2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v.

On September 9, U.S. District Judge [[James Boasberg]] denied the motion. Later the same day, a joint statement was issued by the US Departments of Justice, [[Department of the Army|Army]], and Interior temporarily halting the project on federal land bordering or under the Lake Oahe reservoir. The [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] asked the company for a "voluntary pause" on construction near that area until further study was done on the region extending 20 miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) around [[Lake Oahe]]. In closing the agency representatives said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Finally, we fully support the rights of all Americans to assemble and speak freely. In recent days, we have seen thousands of demonstrators come together peacefully, with support from scores of sovereign tribal governments, to exercise their First Amendment rights and to voice heartfelt concerns about the environment and historic, sacred sites. It is now incumbent on all of us to develop a path forward that serves the broadest public interest.&lt;ref name="pbs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dept. of Justice|title=Joint Statement from the Department of Justice, the Department of the Army and the Department of the Interior Regarding Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v.

Energy Transfer Partners rejected the request to voluntarily halt construction on all surrounding private land and resumed construction within 48 hours.&lt;ref name="NBC News3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/dakota-pipeline-protests/dakota-access-pipeline-what-s-behind-protests-n676801 | title=Dakota Access Pipeline: What's Behind the Protests? | publisher=NBC News | date=November 4, 2016 | accessdate=November 5, 2016 | author=Medina, Daniel A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, chairman and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners Kelcy Warren responded to the federal government's request, saying concerns about the pipeline's impact on the water supply were "unfounded." Warren said that "multiple archaeological studies conducted with state historic preservation offices found no sacred items along the route". They did not indicate that they would voluntarily cease work on the pipeline. Warren wrote that the company will meet with officials in Washington "to understand their position and reiterate our commitment to bring the Dakota Access Pipeline into operation."&lt;ref name="USAToday-Sanders-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gaudiano|first1=Nicole|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/13/sen-bernie-sanders-native-americans-protest-pipeline/90306142/|title=Bernie Sanders, Native Americans say oil pipeline will poison drinking water|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|federal appeals judges]] heard arguments over whether to stop work on the pipeline; a ruling was not expected for several weeks. At that time the Army Corps of Engineers had not yet made a final decision on whether to grant an easement to build under the Missouri River. Under questioning, a pipeline attorney said that "if the court allowed it, the company would continue building up to the lake's edge even before the easement decision, because each extra month of delay will cost the company more than $80 million".&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;

===Army Corps of Engineers delays decision===

On November 14, the Army Corps of Engineers said it needed more time to study the impact of the plan. In a news release, they said: "The Army has determined that additional discussion and analysis are warranted in light of the history of the Great Sioux Nation's dispossessions of lands, the importance of Lake Oahe to the Tribe, our government-to-government relationship, and the statute governing easements through government property."&lt;ref name = BMJ &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bemidjipioneer.com/news/region/4159150-corps-more-discussion-needed-agency-will-approve-dakota-access-easement|title=Corps: More discussion needed before agency will approve Dakota...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy Transfer Partners responded by criticizing the Obama administration for "political interference" and said that "further delay in the consideration of this case would add millions of dollars more each month in costs which cannot be recovered." North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple criticized the decision saying the pipeline would be safe and that the decision was "long overdue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=James MacPherson|author2=Blake Nicholson|title=Pipeline Company Seeks Court Permission to Proceed With Plan|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/robert-kennedy-jr-join-dakota-access-pipeline-protests-43539715|publisher=ABC news|accessdate=November 18, 2016|date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Stevens, spokesman for the MAIN Coalition, a labor group, called the Corps's announcement "yet another attempt at death by delay" and said the Obama administration "has chosen to further fan the flames of protest by more inaction." North Dakota Senator [[John Hoeven]] said in a statement that the delay "will only prolong the disruption in the region caused by protests and make life difficult for everyone who lives and works in the area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Forum News Service|title=Corps: More discussion needed before agency will approve Dakota Access easement|url=http://www.bemidjipioneer.com/news/region/4159150-corps-more-discussion-needed-agency-will-approve-dakota-access-easement|website=Bemidji Pioneer|publisher=Bemidji Pioneer and Forum Communications Company|accessdate=November 18, 2016|date=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on the [[PBS Newshour]] on November 16, Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren responded to questions about the Tribe's two main concerns, damage to ancestral sites and the potential of water contamination if a leak occurred:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, first of all, I think this is well known by now. We're not on any Indian property at all, no Native American property. We're on private lands. That's number one.  Number two, this pipeline is new steel pipe. We're boring underneath Lake Oahe. It's going to go 90 feet to 150 feet (27.5-45.7 m) below the lake's surface. It's thick wall pipe, extra thick, by the way, more so than just the normal pipe that we lay.  Also, on each side of the lake, there's automated valves that, if in the very, very unlikely situation there were to be a leak, our control room shuts down the pipe, encapsulates that small section that could be in peril.  So, that's just not going to happen. Number one, we're not going to have a leak. I can't promise that, of course, but that — no one would get on airplanes if they thought they were going to crash.  And, number two, there is no way there would be any crude contaminate their water supply. They're 70 miles (110 km) downstream.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=CEO behind Dakota Access to protesters: 'We're building the pipeline'|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/ceo-behind-dakota-access-protesters-building-pipeline/|website=PBS Newshour|accessdate=November 22, 2016|date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On December 4, the Army announced that it would not grant an [[easement]] for the pipeline to be drilled under Lake Oahe.&lt;ref name="Healy 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Healy|first1=Jack|last2=Fandos|first2=Nicholas|title=PROTESTERS GAIN VICTORY IN FIGHT OVER OIL PIPELINE NEAR SIOUX RESERVATION: Army Blocks Drilling and Says It Will Seek a New Route|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/04/us/federal-officials-to-explore-different-route-for-dakota-pipeline.html|accessdate=December 5, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 5, 2016|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was made by the [[Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works)]], [[Jo-Ellen Darcy]]:

Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners issued a same-day response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The White House's directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency.

As stated all along, ETP and SXL fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161204005090/en/Energy-Transfer-Partners-Sunoco-Logistics-Partners-Respond|title=Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners Respond to the Statement from the Department of the Army - Business Wire|publisher=|accessdate=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Dakota Access, LLC permitted to continue construction ===

On January 24, 2017 newly elected President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing the pipeline's construction to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CNN|title=Trump advances controversial oil pipelines with executive action|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/24/politics/trump-keystone-xl-dakota-access-pipelines-executive-actions/index.html|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 8, 2017,  the U.S. Army Core of Engineers (USACE) granted Dakota Access, LLC an easement based on the [[Mineral Leasing Act]] to cross Lake Oahe and finish construction of the pipeline. On February 9, 2017, the Court dismissed the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's motion for a restraining order citing [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] violations, claiming an oil spill would disrupt their ability to worship freely.&lt;ref name="FAQ: Standing Rock Litigation"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://earthjustice.org/features/faq-standing-rock-litigation#documents|title=FAQ: Standing Rock Litigation|date=2017-02-14|work=Earthjustice|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;
On February 14, 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a motion for summary judgment. The motion asked the Court to rule on unresolved legal questions concerning USACE, including the meeting of [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) requirements and the violation of Tribal treaty rights. The motion addressed three claims: 1) the lawful requirement of a full, transparent and public environmental review for any federal action that has "significant" environmental effects, 2) Tribal treaty rights that guarantee the integrity of their reservation, and 3) the reversal of decisions from the previous administration.&lt;ref name="FAQ: Standing Rock Litigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="earthjustice.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's Litigation on the Dakota Access Pipeline|url=https://earthjustice.org/features/faq-standing-rock-litigation|website=Earth Justice|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

====Federal Court finds the environmental study inadequate====

On June 14, 2017, Federal Judge James Boasberg ruled that the permits authorizing the pipeline to cross the Missouri River ultimately violated NEPA. In a&amp;nbsp;ninety-one page&amp;nbsp;decision, Judge Boasberg wrote, "the Court agrees that [the Corps] did not adequately consider the impacts of an oil spill on fishing rights, hunting rights, or environmental justice, or the degree to which the pipeline's effects are likely to be highly controversial".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-15|title=Judge Orders More Reviews of Dakota Access Pipeline|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P4-1909567142.html?refid=easy_hf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; USACE failed to comply with NEPA because their Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) did not address the following: (1) likelihood that the project would be controversial, (2) the consequence of an oil spill on fishing and hunting rights, and (3) the environmental justice impact of the project.&lt;ref name="FAQ: Standing Rock Litigation"/&gt; The court halted construction on the pipeline until USACE could adequately address these concerns.&amp;nbsp;The Court's finding did not include a decision on continuing pipeline operation, but did request an additional briefing on the subject. Judge Boasberg asked the parties to submit legal briefs on the question of whether the Court should shut down the pipeline pending the completion of a lawful environmental review.&lt;ref name="FAQ: Standing Rock Litigation"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="earthjustice.org"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

On August 7, 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a legal brief arguing in favor of pipeline shutdown during the environmental review process.&lt;ref name="FAQ: Standing Rock Litigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="earthjustice.org"/&gt; The Tribes received support from law professors and practitioners, tribes and tribal organizations, and other amicus parties.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Court granted the Tribes' motion for summary judgment for three reasons. First, the Court held that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to address expert critiques of Dakota Access, LLC's oil spill risk analysis. Second, the Court found fault in USACE's disregard of impacts an oil spill would have on the Tribes' Treaty rights to fish and hunt.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northdakota-pipeline-dapl/federal-judge-asks-army-to-revisit-environmental-analysis-of-dakota-pipeline-idUSKBN19538I|title=Federal judge orders more environmental analysis of Dakota pipeline|date= 2017-06-15|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Court found that USACE conducted a skewed assessment that reached the conclusion that the selected site raised no environmental justice concerns. Under the Court's order, USACE will reassess these questions and come to a new decision on if a full environmental impact statement is required.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

On October 11, 2017, the Court ruled that DAPL could continue to operate while USACE reassessed the environmental impact of the pipeline.  While the Court did not find that shutting down the pipeline would cause a major economic disruption as claimed by DAPL, they refused to shut the pipeline down during the impact study due to the possibility that USACE would be able to justify its decision to not do a full environmental review.   USACE predicts that the review will be finished by April 2018.  Following the Court's finding a statement was issued by Earthjustice Attorney Jan Hasselman, who is representing the Tribe.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today's decision is a disappointing continuation of a historic pattern:  other people get all the profits, and the Tribes get all the risk and harm.  The court already found that the Corps violated the law when it issued the permits without thoroughly considering the impact on the people of Standing Rock. The company should not be allowed to continue operating while the Corps studies that threat.,&lt;ref name="earthjustice.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Safety measures imposed====

Following a 200,000 gallon [[Keystone pipeline]] oil spill in November 2017, Judge Boasberg imposed several interim measures over the ongoing operation of the Dakota Access pipeline.
The Court ordered three measures, which had been requested by the Tribe.  According to a report published by [[Earthjustice]], a non-profit public interest law organization dedicated to environmental issues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Court ordered the Corps and DAPL to work with the Tribes to complete oil spill response plans at Lake Oahe. Up to now, the Tribe has been kept in the dark about spill response planning and was not involved in the process of developing plans to address spills at Lake Oahe. Second, the Court ordered an independent audit of DAPL's compliance with the permit conditions and standards. The Tribe has to be involved in the selection of an auditor. Finally, DAPL must file regular reports on any incidents or repairs on the pipeline. Such reporting is not currently required by law, which means the public does not learn about the nearly constant spills and leaks of oil that occur on major pipelines.&lt;ref name="earthjustice.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conditions were all opposed by the Corps and by DAPL.

== TigerSwan security firm ==

In December 2016, it was reported that Dakota Access LLC had hired the firm [[TigerSwan]] to provide security during the protest.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=May|first1=Charlie|title=A reporter's notebook:The journey to Oceti Sakowin, the protest camp of the Standing Rock Sioux|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/12/25/a-reporters-notebook-the-journey-to-oceti-sakowin-the-protest-camp-of-the-standing-rock-sioux/|accessdate=15 May 2017|agency=salon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, internal TigerSwan documents leaked to ''[[The Intercept]]'' and other documents obtained through public records requests revealed a close collaboration between the pipeline company and local, state, and federal law enforcement as they carried out "military-style counterterrorism measures" to suppress the protesters.  TigerSwan also collected information used to assist prosecutors in building cases against protesters, and used social media in an attempt to sway public support  for the pipeline.  One of the released documents called the pipeline opposition movement "an ideologically driven insurgency with a strong religious component" that operated along a "jihadist insurgency model".&lt;ref name=intercept&gt;{{Cite news| last = Brown| first = Alleen| title = Leaked Documents Reveal Counterterrorism Tactics Used at Standing Rock to “Defeat Pipeline Insurgencies”| work = The Intercept| accessdate = 2017-05-30| url = https://theintercept.com/2017/05/27/leaked-documents-reveal-security-firms-counterterrorism-tactics-at-standing-rock-to-defeat-pipeline-insurgencies/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Intercept''  reported that "Energy Transfer Partners has continued to retain TigerSwan long after most of the anti-pipeline campers left North Dakota, and the most recent TigerSwan reports emphasize the threat of growing activism around other pipeline projects across the country."&lt;ref name=intercept/&gt;

==Presidential memorandum by Donald Trump==
[[File:Dakota Access Pipeline protesters against Donald Trump (31619797533).jpg|thumb|Banner against the pipeline in a 2017 inauguration day protest in Minnesota]]

In December 2016, while still directed by the Obama administration, the Army Corps of Engineers&amp;nbsp;  decided  that further study to address tribal concerns was needed and launched a study on January 18, 2017. But on January 24, newly elected President [[Donald Trump]] signed a [[presidential memorandum]] to advance the construction of the pipeline under "terms and conditions to be negotiated". The order would expedite the environmental review that Trump described as an "incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process."&lt;ref name="Mufson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg240117"/&gt;

On February 7, 2017, Trump authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed, ending its environmental impact assessment and the associated public comment period.&lt;ref name="Harder"/&gt; The director of the Indigenous Environmental Network released a statement saying: "The granting of an easement, without any environmental review or tribal consultation, is not the end of this fight — it is the new beginning.

Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] said he "join[s] with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the many tribal nations fighting this dangerous pipeline.  Like the Keystone XL pipeline, which I opposed since day one, the Dakota Access fracked oil pipeline, will transport some of the dirtiest fuel on the planet. Regardless of the court's decision, the Dakota Access pipeline must be stopped. As a nation, our job is to break our addiction to fossil fuels, not increase our dependence on oil."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksfy.com/content/news/Bernie-Sanders-releases-statement-opposing-Dakota-Access-Pipeline-391318252.html Bernie Sanders releases a statement opposing Dakota Access Pipeline].

Field reporter [[Jordan Chariton]] (of '' [[The Young Turks]]''' on-the-road program ''TYT Politics'') was one of the most active journalists participating in the protests.  He  commented on the scant presence of journalists from mainstream networks such as [[CNN]] and [[MSNBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tytnetwork.com/about/host-bios/jordan-chariton/|title=Jordan Chariton|date=March 13, 2016|newspaper=TYT Network|language=en-US|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online Presence===

Along with the hashtag #NoDAPL, many other hashtags sprang up on [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[Instagram]] to protest the pipeline. The hashtags included #ReZpectOurWater, which is a play on "reservations", #StandWithStandingRock, and #WaterisLife.&lt;ref&gt;https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/9anxk8/artists-standing-with-standing-rock&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2016/12/07/standing-rock-nodapl-youth/&lt;/ref&gt; Activist [[Naomi Klein]] posted a Facebook video in which she interviewed a youth, Iron Eyes, which gained more than a million views in 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petronzio|first1=Matt|title=How young Native Americans used social media to build up the #NoDAPL movement|url=http://mashable.com/2016/12/07/standing-rock-nodapl-youth/#FYOoczmbpqq5|website=Mashable|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Klein, writing an editorial in ''The Nation'' shortly after the Army Corps of Engineers had turned down the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline to be built under the Missouri River, said, "The Lesson from Standing Rock: Organizing and Resistance Can Win."  As a long standing climate change activist, Klein said that past resistance has brought about change incrementally and only after a delay following mass actions.  However, she wrote, Standing Rock had been "different."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Standing Rock is different. This time the movement was still out on the land in massive numbers when the news came down. The line between resistance and results is bright and undeniable. That kind of victory is rare precisely because it's contagious, because it shows people everywhere that organizing and resistance are not futile. And as Donald Trump moves closer and closer to the White House, that message is very important indeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klein|first1=Naomi|title=The Lesson from Standing Rock: Organizing and Resistance Can Win|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/the-lesson-from-standing-rock-organizing-and-resistance-can-win/|website=The Nation|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
However, calling the Army Corps of Engineers  request for further study an "incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process," on January 24, newly elected President Donald Trump signed a [[presidential memorandum]] to advance the construction of the pipeline.&lt;ref name="Mufson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg240117"/&gt;

=== Solidarity march in Denver ===
On September 8, about 500 Native Americans and other protesters marched in Denver to show solidarity with the Standing Rock Americans. State Representative [[Joseph Salazar|Joe Salazar]] spoke about the safety of pipelines and described a recent Colorado Oil and Gas Association statement on oil pipeline safety as "full of lies."&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/09/08/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest-denver/|title=North Dakota oil pipeline protest finds support in Denver, hundreds gather at State Capitol|date=September 8, 2016|publisher=The Denver Post|accessdate=September 30, 2016|author=Kieran Nicholson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, a rally and march was held in Seattle to show solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The mayor of Seattle and city council members joined leaders from Northwest tribes from Quinualt, Makah, Lummi, Suquamish, Tulalip, Swinomish, Puyallup and others to show opposition to the pipeline. [[Fawn Sharp]], president of the [[Quinault Indian Nation]] and the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, said that while the tribes are "determined to win this fight", a "deeper fix" is needed. "The U.S. must recognize that we have political equality.  This is much larger than a specific infrastructure project. It goes to the fundamental relationship."&lt;ref name="Seattle Times Mapes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/tribes-march-in-seattle-to-back-standing-rock-sioux-in-pipeline-fight/|title=Tribes march in Seattle to back Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota pipeline fight|date=September 17, 2016|publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=September 29, 2016|author=Lynda V.

=== Thanksgiving Day protests ===
[[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] has been described as a reminder of the strained relationship between the U.S. government and native people. On the November 24 holiday, several thousand continued to protest the pipeline; some estimated that the number of protesters, which fluctuates, doubled that day.&lt;ref name=ThanksgivingNPR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/25/503278053/protesters-mark-a-solemn-thanksgiving-day-at-standing-rock|title=Protesters Mark A Solemn Thanksgiving Day At Standing Rock|work=National Public Radio|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of people joined the protest that day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.maoritelevision.com/news/politics/hundreds-pour-standing-rock-ahead-thanksgiving|title=Hundreds pour into Standing Rock ahead of Thanksgiving|publisher=|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including groups from California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/11/23/ponciano-standing-rock-sioux-need-silicon-valleys-help/|title=San Jose helps Standing Rock Sioux protest Big Oil, pipeline|publisher=|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kezi.com/news/local/402355836.html|title=KEZI.com - Eugene Group Heads to Standing Rock for Thanksgiving|date=November 21, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=November 28, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128050659/http://www.kezi.com/news/local/402355836.html|archivedate=November 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wisconsin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waow.com/story/33790499/northcentral-wisconsin-pipeline-protesters-spend-thanksgiving-at-standing-rock|title=Northcentral Wisconsin pipeline protesters spend Thanksgiving at Standing Rock|first=Alexandra|last=Burnley|publisher=|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpr.org/news/newsbeat/durango-protesters-to-join-standing-rock-for-thanksgiving|title=Durango Protesters To Join Standing Rock For Thanksgiving|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/TheBattery/archives/2016/11/22/charlestonians-from-standing-rock-on-thanksgiving-week-we-need-more-bodies-and-warm-spaces|title=Charlestonians from Standing Rock on Thanksgiving week: "We need people"|first=Kelly Rae|last=Smith|publisher=|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/news/standing-rock-caravan-leaves-from-port-townsend-today/|title=Standing Rock caravan leaves from Port Townsend - Peninsula Daily News|date=November 21, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesters built a floating bridge to Turtle Island, considered sacred ground, and 400 gathered near the bridge, some crossing over to perform a prayer ceremony.&lt;ref name=ThanksgivingNPR /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/protesters-rally-in-multiple-locations/article_f8c6c5b1-bf84-5cd2-a191-1f65afb106e5.html|title=Protesters vow to "reclaim" land, bridge Thursday|first=BLAIR EMERSON Bismarck|last=Tribune|publisher=|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influx of many new people over Thanksgiving weekend caused new problems, according to some activists. Some criticized a group of young, mostly white, people at the protest for treating it like a festival such as [[Burning Man]] by bringing drugs and alcohol, requiring supplies and provisions rather than sustaining themselves, or performing unsolicited live music.&lt;ref name="burningman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Standing-Rock-protest-white-people-Burning-Man-10640250.php|first=Katie |last=Dowd | date=November 30, 2016 | work=San Francisco Chronicle | title=Standing Rock activists asking white people to stop treating pipeline protest like Burning Man}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Thanksgiving Day protest in Portland, Oregon drew about 350 in heavy rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Theen, Andrew|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/11/standing_rock_rally_draws_hund.html|title=Standing Rock rally draws hundreds to downtown Portland|publisher=|accessdate=December 14, 2016|date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support from military veterans===

In November, a group called Veterans Stand for Standing Rock formed to participate in nonviolent intervention to defend the demonstrators from what the group has called "assault and intimidation at the hands of the militarized police force." According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "as many as 2,000 veterans" indicated that they would gather at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation to serve as "human shields" for protesters. The organizers of these protests included retired Baltimore police sergeant Michael A. Wood, Jr., and Wes Clark, Jr., the son of former Supreme NATO Commander and [[Wesley Clark presidential campaign, 2004|2004 presidential candidate]] [[Wesley Clark]]. Wes Clark, Jr is affiliated with ''[[The Young Turks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/veterans-to-serve-as-human-shields-for-pipeline-protesters.html|title=Veterans to Serve as 'Human Shields' for Dakota Pipeline Protesters|date=November 29, 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the executive order made by President Trump in January 2017 which overturned the decision of former President Obama to halt the construction of the pipeline and the February order in which he authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed, US veterans returned to Standing Rock to a form human shield to protect Dakota Access pipeline protesters. Air force veteran Elizabeth Williams said, "We are prepared to put our bodies between Native elders and a privatized military force. We've stood in the face of fire before. We feel a responsibility to use the skills we have."&lt;ref name="Independent2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/us-army-veterans-human-shield-dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock-a7576291.html |title=US veterans return to Standing Rock to form human shield to protect Dakota Access pipeline protesters |last=Osborne |first=Samuel |date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate support===

In February 2017, [[Seattle, Washington]]'s city council unanimously voted to not renew its contract with [[Wells Fargo]] in a move that cites the bank's role as a lender to the Dakota Access Pipeline project as well as its "creation of millions of bogus accounts" and said the bidding process for its next banking partner would involve "social responsibility." The City Council in [[Davis, California]], took a similar action, voting unanimously to find a new bank to handle its accounts by the end of 2017.&lt;ref name="NPR2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/08/514133514/two-cities-vote-to-pull-more-than-3-billion-from-wells-fargo-over-dakota-pipelin |title=2 Cities To Pull More Than $3 Billion From Wells Fargo Over Dakota Access Pipeline |last=Chappell |first=Bill |date=February 8, 2017}}2 Cities To Pull More Than $3 Billion From Wells Fargo Over Dakota Access Pipeline&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Nations Rise march in Washington D.C.===

In March 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe led a four-day protest in Washington D.C., culminating in the Native Nations Rise march on March 10. The protesters marched through the capital, pausing to erect a tipi at [[Old Post Office Pavilion|Trump International Hotel]], and rallied in front of the White House.&lt;ref name="guardian-10mar2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gambino|first1=Lauren|title=Native Americans take Dakota Access pipeline protest to Washington|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/10/native-nations-march-washington-dakota-access-pipeline|accessdate=March 10, 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

In September, Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] spoke to a crowd of about 3,000 members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other tribal nations and supporters at a protest held outside of the [[White House]]. Saying "the pipeline threatens the environment and water resources and exploits Native Americans", he asked President Obama to take action and conduct a full environmental and cultural impact analysis of the project, which he believed would kill the pipeline.&lt;ref name="USAToday-Sanders-2016" /&gt; Following the use of the National Guard and police in riot gear to remove protesters from a protest camp in October, Sanders again called on the president to suspend construction of the pipeline. In a letter to the President, Sanders said in part: "It is deeply distressing to me that the federal government is putting the profits of the oil industry ahead of the treaty and sovereign rights of Native American communities. Mr. President, you took a bold and principled stand against the [[Keystone Pipeline]] – I ask you to take a similar stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline."&lt;ref name="Bernie Sanders "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-calls-on-president-to-intervene-in-dakota-access-pipeline-dispute | title=Sanders Calls on President to Intervene in Dakota Access Pipeline Dispute | publisher=Bernie Sanders | date=October 28, 2016 | accessdate=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saying that the Dakota Access pipeline project is part of a "long history of pushing the impacts of pollution onto the most economically and politically disadvantaged people and communities across this country", Representative [[Raúl Grijalva]], the [[Ranking member|ranking Democrat]] on the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|House Natural Resources Committee]], on September 22 asked the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw the existing permits for the pipeline.&lt;ref name="NBC News1" /&gt;

Saying "the project's current permits should be suspended and all construction stopped until a complete environmental and cultural review has been completed for the entire project", Senators [[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]], [[Dianne Feinstein]], [[Ed Markey]], [[Patrick Leahy]] and [[Benjamin Cardin]] on October 13 called on President Barack Obama to order a comprehensive environmental review of the pipeline project. They also requested stronger tribal consultation for the contested part of the route.&lt;ref name="GrandForksHerald-Sanders-2016" /&gt;

Calling the proposed pipeline route "the ripest case of environmental racism I have seen in a long time", on October 26 the Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] announced support for the movement, saying, "The tribes of this country have sacrificed a lot so this great country could be built. With promises broken, land stolen and sacred lands desecrated, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is standing up for their right to clean water. They have lost land for settlers to farm, more land for gold in the Black Hills, and then again, even more, land for the dam that was built for hydropower. When will the taking stop?"&lt;ref name="The Seattle Times"/&gt;

In September, Obama spoke to tribal representatives, saying, "I know that many of you have come together across tribes and across the country to support the community at Standing Rock. And together, you're making your voices heard." He again discussed the protest movement on November 2, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We're monitoring this closely. My view is that there is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans. And I think that right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline. We're going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to the traditions of First Americans.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/11/02/dakota-access-obama-says-army-corps-is-weighing-whether-to-reroute-pipeline/ | title=On Dakota Access, Obama says Army Corps is weighing whether to 'reroute' pipeline | publisher=The Washington Post | date=November 1, 2016 | accessdate=November 3, 2016 |author1=Eilperin, Juliet |author2=Hawkins, Derek }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives weighed in on the protest on November 29, 2016. Senators [[Al Franken]] of Minnesota and [[Cory Booker]] of New Jersey called upon U.S. Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] to investigate the tactics of law enforcement officers against peaceful protesters, and to send monitors to track any violence against protesters.&lt;ref name=SalonCongressFinally/&gt; Several members of the House made statements as well, and Representative [[Tulsi Gabbard]] of Hawaii announced plans to join hundreds of other military veterans in protecting the protesters in early December.&lt;ref name=SalonCongressFinally&gt;{{cite news | title=Congress finally begins to notice the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock | date=November 29, 2016 | first=Sophia | last=Tesfaye | url= http://www.salon.com/2016/11/29/congress-finally-begins-to-notice-the-dakota-access-pipeline-protests-at-standing-rock/ | work=Salon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native American [[lacrosse]] players [[Lyle Thompson]] and his brothers [[Miles Thompson|Miles]], [[Jeremy Thompson|Jeremy]] and Hiana and others including Bill O'Brien and  [[Scott Marr]], used social media to support the protesters.  They visited the camp as well, bringing lacrosse sticks and organizing games, giving instructions to those who had never before played the game.  Following President Trump's January 2017 reversal of the Court decisions made under the Obama administration, the players said that they planned to continue with their support.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grossman|first1=Evan|title=Leading lacrosse figures join resistance against President Trump and Dakota Access Pipeline|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/leading-lacrosse-figures-join-fight-dapl-article-1.2955328|website=Daily News|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her unexpected win in the 2018 New York Democratic primary race, [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] credited the time she spent at the protest camp as the reason for her decision run for political office. In an interview she recalled her visit to Standing Rock as a tipping point, saying that she had previously felt that the only way to effectively run for office was if you had access to wealth, social influence, and power.  But her visit to North Dakota, where she saw others "putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community," inspired her to begin to work within her own community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Paiella |first1=Gabriella |title=The 28-Year-Old at the Center of One of This Year’s Most Exciting Primaries |url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-interview.html |website=The Cut |accessdate=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Nations presentation ==

On September 20, 2016, Standing Rock Chairman [[David Archambault II]] addressed the [[UN Human Rights Council]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], where he called "upon all parties to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline." Citing the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux|1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]] and [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie]], two treaties ratified by the U.S. Senate that recognize the Sioux's national sovereignty, Archambault told the Council that "the oil companies and the government of the United States have failed to respect our sovereign rights."&lt;ref name="NBC News2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/standing-rock-sioux-takes-pipeline-fight-un-human-rights-council-n651381 | title=Standing Rock Sioux Takes Pipeline Fight to UN Human Rights Council in Geneva  | publisher=NBC News | date=September 20, 2016 | accessdate=October 26, 2016 | author=Medina, Daniel A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2016, [[Victoria Tauli-Corpuz]], a United Nations expert on the rights of indigenous peoples, admonished the U.S., saying, "The tribe was denied access to information and excluded from consultations at the planning stage of the project, and environmental assessments failed to disclose the presence and proximity of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation." She also responded to the rights of pipeline protesters, saying, "The U.S. authorities should fully protect and facilitate the right to freedom of peaceful assembly of indigenous peoples, which plays a key role in empowering their ability to claim other rights."&lt;ref name="Common Dreams"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/09/25/un-experts-united-states-stop-dapl-now | title=UN Experts to United States: Stop DAPL Now | publisher=Common Dreams | date=September 25, 2016 | accessdate=September 27, 2016 | author=Germanos, Andrea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethical socialism''' is a [[political philosophy]] that appeals to [[socialism]] on [[Ethics|ethical]] and [[Morality|moral]] grounds as opposed to [[Economics|economic]], [[Ethical egoism|egoistic]] and [[Consumerism|consumeristic]] grounds.&lt;ref name="ref52"/&gt; It emphasizes the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of [[Altruism|service]], [[cooperation]] and [[social justice]] while opposing possessive [[individualism]].&lt;ref name="ref58-9"&gt;Noel W. Thompson (2006). ''Political Economy and the Labour Party: The Economics of Democratic Socialism, 1884-2005''. 2nd edition. Oxon, England, United Kingdom; New York City, New York, United States: Routledge. pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to socialism inspired by [[rationalism]], [[historical materialism]], [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory which base their appeals for socialism on grounds of economic efficiency, rationality, or historical inevitability, ethical socialism focuses on the moral and ethical reasons for advocating socialism.

Ethical socialism had a profound impact on the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] movement and [[reformism]] during the later half of the 20th century, particularly in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;John Dearlove; Peter Saunders (2000). ''Introduction to British Politics''. Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref52&gt;Noel W. Thompson (2006). ''Political Economy and the Labour Party: The Economics of Democratic Socialism, 1884-2005''. 2nd edition. Oxon, England, United Kingdom; New York City, New York, United States: Routledge. pp. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical socialism is distinct in its focus on criticism of the ethics of [[capitalism]] and not merely criticism of the economic, systemic and material issues of capitalism.&lt;ref name=ref52/&gt;

The term ethical socialism initially originated as a pejorative by the Marxist economist [[Rosa Luxemburg]] against reformist [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist Marxist]] [[Eduard Bernstein]] and his supporters, who evoked [[Neo-Kantianism|Kantian]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s and ethical arguments in favor of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger (1997). ''The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism''. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-recognized ethical socialists soon arose in Britain such as [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R. H. Tawney]] and its ideals were connected to Christian socialist, [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] and [[Guild socialism|guild socialist]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Noel W. Thompson (2006). ''Political Economy and the Labour Party: The Economics of Democratic Socialism, 1884-2005''. 2nd edition. Oxon, England, United Kingdom; New York City, New York, United States: Routledge. pp. 52, 58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical socialism was an important ideology within the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="tansey"&gt;Stephen D. Tansey; Nigel A. Jackson (2008). ''Politics: The basics''. 4th edition. Oxon, England, United Kingdom; New York City, New York, United States: Routledge. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical socialism has been publicly supported by [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|British Prime Ministers]] [[Ramsay MacDonald]],&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Morgan (2006). ''Ramsay MacDonald''. London, England, United Kingdom: Haus Publishing Ltd. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement Attlee]]&lt;ref&gt;David Howell (2006). ''Attlee''. London, England, United Kingdom: Haus Publishing Ltd. pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref name=tansey/&gt;

When the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) renounced Marxism during the [[Godesberg Program]] in the 1950s, ethical socialism became the official philosophy within the SPD.&lt;ref name="Dietrich Orlow 2000. Pp. 190"&gt;Dietrich Orlow (2000). ''Common Destiny: A Comparative History of the Dutch, French, and German Social Democratic Parties, 1945-1969''. Berghahn Books. pp. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tawney denounced self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism.&lt;ref name=ref52/&gt; Tawney opposed what he called the "acquisitive society" that causes [[private property]] to be used to transfer surplus profit to "functionless owners", i.e. [[Rentier capitalism|capitalist rentiers]].&lt;ref name=ref58-9/&gt; However, he did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that [[management]] and [[Employment|employees]] could join together in a political alliance for reform.&lt;ref name=ref58-9/&gt; Tawney supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of [[progressive tax]]ation to redistribute these funds to provide [[social welfare]] (including [[public health care]], [[public education]] and [[public housing]])&lt;ref name=ref58-9/&gt; and the [[nationalization]] of strategic industries and services.&lt;ref name=ref58-9/&gt; He supported worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in regulating the economy.&lt;ref name=ref58-9/&gt;

Though Tawney supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, he stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands.&lt;ref&gt;Noel W. Thompson (2006). ''Political Economy and the Labour Party: The Economics of Democratic Socialism, 1884-2005''. 2nd edition. Oxon, England, United Kingdom; New York City, New York, United States: Routledge. pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hill Green]] supported the right of [[equal opportunity]] for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession.&lt;ref name=ref35&gt;Matt Carter (2003). ''T.H. Green and the Development of Ethical Socialism''. Exeter, England, United Kingdom; Charlottesville, Virginia, United States: Imprint Academic. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Green opposed "[[property rights]] of the few" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many.&lt;ref name=ref35/&gt;

Ethical socialism was advocated and promoted by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has been influenced by [[John Macmurray]] who himself was influenced by Green.&lt;ref name=ref189&gt;Matt Carter (2003). ''T.H. Green and the Development of Ethical Socialism''. Exeter, England, United Kingdom; Charlottesville, Virginia, United States: Imprint Academic. p. 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has defined ethical socialism with similar notions promoted by earlier ethical socialists, such as emphasis on the [[common good]], rights and responsibilities and support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation.&lt;ref name=ref189/&gt; Blair believes that the Labour Party ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it "abandoned" ethical socialism and believes that the Labour Party's recovery required a "return to the ethical socialist values last promoted by the Attlee Labour government".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bevir (2005). ''New Labour: A Critique''. London, England, United Kingdom; New York City, New York, United States: Routledge. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|grave and acute (phonetics)}}

From an articulatory perspective, [[phoneme]]s can be described as '''front''' or '''back'''.  '''[[Front vowel]]s''' refer to vowels articulated towards the front of the mouth. This can either refer to vowels that are more front than [[Central vowel|central]] or, more rarely, only to fully front vowels, i.e. the ones that are articulated as far forward as possible in the mouth. A similar distinction holds for '''[[back vowel]]s''', which can refer to vowels that are more back than central or, more rarely, only to fully back vowels, i.e. the ones that are articulated as back as possible in the mouth. However, acoustically there is little difference between a [[central vowel]] and a [[back vowel]], with the result that the two are frequently grouped together into an even broader category of "back vowels", or a category of "non-front vowels".

A '''back consonant''' includes all consonants whose [[place of articulation]] is in the [[soft palate]] (velum) or farther back, including [[velar consonant|velar]], [[uvular consonant|uvular]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]], and [[glottal consonant]]s.  From the perspective of primary places of articulation, this includes all of the [[laryngeal consonant]]s and some of the [[dorsal consonant]]s (specifically, excluding [[palatal consonant]]s).

A '''front consonant''' includes all consonants that are not back consonants, including [[palatal consonant|palatal]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], and [[labial consonant]]s.

Front and back vowels are also known as [[grave and acute (phonetics)|acute and grave vowels]], respectively.
For consonants, however, front/back are not synonyms of acute/grave.  Grave consonants include both back consonants and [[labial consonants]], while acute consonants include all of front consonants ''except'' labial consonants.  This suggests that a three-way division between labial, acute and back (vaguely speaking, "P-like", "T-like" and "K-like", respectively) might be useful in some contexts.

'''HDMS ''Peder Skram''''' was a {{sclass-|Peder Skram|frigate}} in the [[Royal Danish Navy]] which was in use until 1990. It is now docked at [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Holmen]] in [[Copenhagen]] where it serves as a privately operated museum ship along with the ships of the [[Royal Danish Naval Museum]]. The ship is named after [[Peder Skram]], a 16th-century Danish [[admiral]].

It was published in paperback format by [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] in 1998.

The book received a positive reception from reviews in [[academic journal]]s including: ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' published by the [[Council on Foreign Relations]],&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt; ''[[Ethics &amp; International Affairs]]'',&lt;ref name="xenos" /&gt; and ''[[International Review of the Red Cross]]''.&lt;ref name="megret" /&gt;

==Contents summary==
[[Jonathan Moore (State Department official)|Jonathan Moore]] drew together noteworthy writers to contribute to ''Hard Choices'', including: [[Kofi A. Annan]], [[Rony Brauman]], [[Romeo A. Dallaire]], [[Richard J. Goldstone]], [[J. Bryan Hehir]], [[Michael Ignatieff]], [[Ian Martin (UN official)|Ian Martin]], [[Elizabeth Anne Reid|Elizabeth Reid]], [[Mohamed Sahnoun]], [[Mu Sochua]], [[Cornelio Sommaruga]], [[Roger Williamson]], and [[José Zalaquett]]. These individuals have backgrounds in humanitarian aid, academia, and global policymaking. The book attempts to analyze international response to [[humanitarian]] interventions, and suggest ways to improve these processes.

''Hard Choices'' argues that people on the global stage have modified their thoughts regarding humanitarian interventions after striving to assist in aid to [[Somalia]]. World leaders observed that initiatives crafted to help with basic problems and promote stability in the region ended up having unfortunate negative consequences.

Groups wishing to assist in such matters including [[nongovernmental organization]]s, the [[United Nations]], and sovereign [[army|armies]] found they were unclear as to the best method to apply to situations where countries require humanitarian aid. These problems, including those derived from economic inequity, are further muddied due to interests of multiple different stakeholders. The authors assert that further resources should be devoted to addressing moral challenges worldwide.

In addition to Somalia, the book addresses humanitarian problems caused by conflicts in [[Bosnia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Haiti]], and [[Rwanda]]. Major issues grappled with by the authors include problems caused by international sales in the [[defense industry]], global [[refugee]]s, [[international sanctions]], [[economic impact of HIV/AIDS]], and [[human rights]]. The contributors argue that these complex problems may be mitigated through discussion and analysis motivated by a desire to raise the level of quality involved in choices taken by world leaders during policymaking regarding [[humanitarian intervention]].

==Publication history==
''Hard Choices'' was sponsored by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The moral complexities in Kosovo|first=Jonathan|last=Moore|date=April 18, 1999|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Moore (State Department official)|Jonathan Moore]] had been asked by the ICRC in 1996 to produce a monograph which would examine issues surrounding humanitarian intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/newsview.nsf/(httpNews)/0B4D30AEBFD13D1B80256B7B003F4818?OpenDocument|accessdate=March 20, 2015|first=Jonathan|last=Moore|publisher=[[United Nations Research Institute for Social Development]]; www.unrisd.org|title=The Last Word: Hard Choices: Considering Moral Aspects of Humanitarian Intervention|date=September 1, 1998|work=News &amp; Views|archivedate=August 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829074654/http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/newsview.nsf/(httpNews)/0B4D30AEBFD13D1B80256B7B003F4818?OpenDocument}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book was first published in paperback format by [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|493883959}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in an [[eBook]] format in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|607076654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowman &amp; Littlefield released a hardcover edition in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hard Choices: Moral Dilemmas in Humanitarian Intervention|year=1999|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|first=Jonathan|last=Moore|authorlink=Jonathan Moore (State Department official)|isbn=978-0847690305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Hard Choices'' was reviewed in the journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' published by the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal|archivedate=March 19, 2015|accessdate=March 19, 2015|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319165832/http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/54823/eliot-a-cohen/hard-choices-moral-dilemmas-in-humanitarian-intervention|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/54823/eliot-a-cohen/hard-choices-moral-dilemmas-in-humanitarian-intervention|first=Eliot A.|last=Cohen|title=Hard Choices: Moral Dilemmas in Humanitarian Intervention|date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the review, Eliot A. Cohen observed that the book confronted "uncomfortable truths".&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt; Cohen concluded, "Whether medieval politics can control, much less eliminate, medieval brutality is the unanswered question that hangs over this book."&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' discussed the work and cited contributors [[Rony Brauman]] and Mary B. Anderson in an article about problematic issues surrounding [[disaster relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 27, 1999|first=Paul|last=Lewis|title=Downside of Doing Good: Disaster Relief Can Harm|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/arts/downside-of-doing-good-disaster-relief-can-harm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ethics &amp; International Affairs]]'' published a review of the book by Nicholas Xenos, who wrote: "The practitioners who reflect on their experience here strike a consistent theme: Many difficult decisions had to be made, along with trade-offs between consistent concern for human rights and the desire to provide safety, needs assistance, or developmental aid."&lt;ref name="xenos"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Nicholas|last=Xenos|journal=[[Ethics &amp; International Affairs]]|volume=14|date=March 2000|pages=171–173|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1017/S0892679400008819|title=Recent Books on Ethics and International Affairs – Hard Choices: Moral Dilemmas in Humanitarian Intervention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in ''[[International Review of the Red Cross]]'', Frédéric Mégret commented: "''Hard Choices'' argues convincingly in favour of a moral pragmatism that rejects any form of extremism."&lt;ref name="megret"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S1560775500092531|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|first=Frédéric |last=Mégret|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|issn=1560-7755|title=Books and Reviews – Hard choices: Moral dilemmas in humanitarian intervention|date=March 31, 1999|issue=833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mégret's review concluded: "Awareness of the existence of ethical challenges is already a step towards taking them into account. In this regard ''Hard Choices'' is a remarkably frank attempt to consider the consequences and the shortcomings of humanitarian intervention."&lt;ref name="megret" /&gt;

[[Médecins Sans Frontières]] USA include the book among their recommended reading for potential field and office staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/recommended-reading|accessdate=March 20, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821050915/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/recommended-reading|archivedate=August 21, 2014|work=Recommended Reading|title=Recommend publications for potential field and office staff|author=[[Médecins Sans Frontières]]|date=2015|publisher=www.doctorswithoutborders.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Honglujing Stele''' ({{zh|t=鴻臚井|s= 鸿胪井|p=Hónglújǐng}}) is a tablet 3 meters wide, 1.8 meters tall, &amp; 2 meters thick. It has 29 [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] characters written on it.

It is the only [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907) stele from [[Manchuria]]. It mentions the 1st king of the [[Balhae]] around 698 - 926 CE. The king listed on the tablet is [[Go of Balhae]].

This kingdom is considered [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n, or independent, depending on the nationality of the researcher. Russian and Japanese scholars classify it as an independent [[Mohe people|Mohe]] state.

It is currently located in the [[Japanese Imperial Palace]]. It was taken from [[Liaoning]] province, [[Lüshun]] city in about 1907 after the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Chinese researchers are now studying it for the first time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12851">{{distinguish|Industrial music}}
An '''industrial musical''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] performed internally for the [[employee]]s or [[shareholder]]s of a [[business]], to create a feeling of being part of a [[team]], to entertain, and/or to educate and motivate the [[management]] and salespeople to improve [[sales]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. It can be used to increase staff awareness of [[public relations]], [[advertising]], [[marketing]] or [[corporate image]].

Other terms for industrial musicals include the '''corporate musical''' or '''industrial show''', but the latter can also refer to [[trade fair|trade show]]s, which are [[publicity]] events organized by businesses in a specific industry to promote their products to potential buyers.

Industrial musicals are not restricted to [[corporation]]s or to businesses involved in [[industry]]. They should not be confused with [[industrial music]], or with musicals produced by businesses to be seen by the general public, for example, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] stage production of ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]''.

==History==
Industrial musicals originated from company songs, [[anthem]]s and [[jingle]]s for promoting [[enthusiasm]] among workers. The songs were brought in by the management, as opposed to worker-created [[work song]]s. Internal musical groups could be formed to encourage company loyalty, keep employees happy, and to help advertise the company to the public. Early 20th century examples include [[IBM]]'s internal songbook ''Songs of the IBM'', and the [[Larkin Administration Building|Larkin Soap Company]] which organized community singing and had a women's drum corps, an orchestra, a ukulele club, and daily recitals on a pipe organ.

At some point, a collection of company songs was extended into a full [[musical theater]] format, and the industrial musical was born. Many of these musicals were made in North America during the [[boom and bust|economic boom]] that followed [[World War II]], and this practice continued into the 1980s and 1990s.

The earliest known industrial musicals were produced by [[retailer|retail]] and [[automaker|automotive]] companies such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], and the [[Marshall Field]]'s chain of [[department store]]s. By the end of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, other types of businesses also began to put on shows.  Some musicals were part of annual showcase events for presenting a company's new line of products.

Businesses could spend a lot of money to produce a musical, hiring talented [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[composer]]s and [[lyricist]]s. The pay was very good, the task was challenging, and from the theatre's point of view, the production costs were much higher than a regular Broadway musical. Shows could have as many as 30 people in the cast and a 60-piece [[orchestra]]. Composer Hank Beebe estimates that the 1957 [[Chevrolet]] musical was budgeted at over 3 million dollars (U.S.), because it cost six times the amount it took to bring ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' to the stage that same year.

The [[song]] performances were rarely heard outside of the companies they were written for, but sometimes the employees would be given a souvenir [[gramophone record|record album]]. Some productions lasted for a limited number of nights, while others traveled from city to city for regional sales meetings. According to composer [[John Kander]], who conducted several industrial shows early in his career and wrote the music for the 1966 General Electric industrial ''Go Fly a Kite'' (the complete score from which was issued on a 2-LP set that was given to GE employees), the cast albums for these industrial shows "were never intended for commercial release. [...] It was sort of a separate world."&lt;ref&gt;{{NewMusicBox|id=john-kander-passing-through-curtains|title=Passing Through Curtains|composer-link = John Kander | composer = John Kander|author=[[Frank J. Oteri]]|conducted=April 7, 2010|published=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it is largely through these rare albums that evidence of these shows has survived.

By the 1980s, industrial musicals were made less and less often. Jonathan Ward, a writer and [[disc jockey|DJ]] who collects industrial musical albums, theorizes that the reason for the decline was partially due to rising production costs for stage shows, and the availability of low-cost [[video]] and [[multimedia]] technology.

Ward thinks another reason for the decline was a change in work attitudes. In the 1950s and 1960s, employees might have expected to spend the majority of their working [[career]]s with one company. By the 1980s, employees and the management may have been less inclined to think this way. The feelings of company loyalty and [[community]] promoted in the song lyrics would have been met with more [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]].

Some corporations, however, continued to successfully produce industrial musicals during the 1980s and 1990s and beyond. The [[Shaklee|Shaklee Corporation]] created its own in-house production company in 1980. Their team, led by producer Dale T. Hardin, director Craig Schaefer, and composer/lyricist [[Michael Reno]] created dozens of Shaklee Shows from concept to performance, and eventually branched out into in-house satellite TV.&lt;ref name=Imagination&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Gary|title=The Making of Imagination|journal=Shaklee|year=1994|series=Discovery Saturday}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shaklee creative team created their own production company called "Command Performance Productions" that produced shows for other clients such as Charles Schwab and Marriott Lodging until 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buttelman|first=Michele|title=A Long Journey from Nowhere to Sister Act|newspaper=The Santa Clarita Valley Signal|date=November 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the trends that affected industrial musicals, businesses have continued to make company songs. For example, [[KPMG]] produced a [[corporate anthem]] in 2001 called "Our Vision of Global Strategy."

In 2013, the first book on the history of industrial musicals was published, authored by [[Late Night with David Letterman]] writer Steve Young and Mike "Sport" Murphy. A series of industrial music audio anthologies, organized by decade, accompanied the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/theater/industrial-musicals-were-once-big-shows.html|title=Industrial Musicals Were Once Big Shows|last=Grimes|first=William|date=2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a documentary on industrial musicals and Steve Young's quest to discover their creators premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/movies/robert-de-niro-tribeca-film-festival.html|title=Robert De Niro’s Top Picks for the Tribeca Film Festival|date=2018-04-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6534">The '''[[Jean Nicod]] Prize''' is awarded annually in [[Paris]] to a leading [[Philosophy of mind|philosopher of mind]] or philosophically-oriented [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientist]]. The lectures are organized by the ''Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique'' ([[CNRS]]) as part of its effort to promote [[interdisciplinary]] research in [[cognitive science]] in [[France]]. The 1993 lectures marked the centenary of the birth of the French philosopher and logician [[Jean Nicod]] (1893-1924). Besides the CNRS, sponsors include the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS) and the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS). The ''Jean Nicod lecturer'' is expected to deliver at least four lectures on a topic of his or her choice, and subsequently to publish the set of lectures, or a monograph based on them in the ''Jean Nicod Lectures series'' ([[MIT Press]]/Bradford Books; F. Recanati editor).

This is a partial '''list of hobbies'''. A [[hobby]] is an activity, interest, enthusiasm, or pastime that is undertaken for pleasure or relaxation, done during one's own time. This list includes only recognized hobbies that have been the subject of published discussions or that have organized membership associations. Entries in this list should be links to [[Wikipedia]] articles about very specific hobbies or to articles about the subjects of hobbies where there is a section demonstrating that it is or was recognized as a hobby.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6607">'''"Lost in a Pyramid; or, The Mummy's Curse"''' is a short story written by American author [[Louisa May Alcott]] and first published by [[Frank Leslie]] in 1869. Despite being largely overlooked throughout the twentieth century, "Lost in a Pyramid" was rediscovered in 1998 and has since become an influential example of early "[[mummy]]'s curse" narratives.

==Background==
Written in late 1868 or the first week of 1869, "Lost in a Pyramid" was among the last of Louisa May Alcott's short [[sensation novel|sensation thrillers]].&lt;ref name="LMAE"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPMBb1Ql_9UC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=louisa+may+alcott+encyclopedia+mummy+curse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N4ilqcWtfr&amp;sig=a9garoLyVrIDzJHSeJ4EPJNAkUg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim1IHE_oTMAhVKOj4KHfDtBPQQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=louisa%20may%20alcott%20encyclopedia%20mummy%20curse&amp;f=false Gregory Eiselein, Anne K. Phillips (2001). ''The Louisa May Alcott Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of works such as her 1862 story "Pauline's Passion and Punishment" and her 1866 [[novella]] ''[[Behind a Mask|Behind a Mask, or A Woman's Power]]'' (published under the [[pseudonym]] A.M. Barnard) is shown through her continuing preoccupation with ''[[femme fatale]]s'', in this case a mummified sorceress. Alcott had praised such "blood &amp; thunder tales" in an 1862 letter as "easy to 'compoze' and… better paid than moral &amp; elaborate works of Shakespeare."&lt;ref&gt;Alcott, Louisa May.  ''Behind a Mask: The Unknown Thrillers of Louisa May Alcott.'' Ed. Madeleine B. Stern. New York: Morrow, 1975. ''vii.'' Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Lost in a Pyramid" was first published in Frank Leslie's ''The New World'' under the initials L.M.A., alongside two engravings. Written concurrently with ''[[Little Women]],'' Alcott's interest in [[Egypt]] carries over into the novel, where, according to ''The Louisa May Alcott Encyclopedia'', Jo March "attends a lecture on the Pyramids, which inspires her to use exotic backdrops for modern sensation stories."&lt;ref name="LMAE" /&gt;

==Plot summary==
After an expedition to Egypt with his colleague Professor Niles, Paul Forsyth returns to his fiancée Evelyn with a mysterious box of scarlet seeds. He warns her that the story of their origin will haunt her, but her naïve curiosity prevails.

Forsyth's tale begins when, despite fatigue and growing wariness, he follows the insatiable Niles deep into the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Pyramid of Cheops]]. The two decide to lie in the sand and rest while Niles's guide, Jumal, seeks another guide to lead Forsyth to safety. Awaking alone, Forsyth plunges farther into the [[labyrinth]] in search of Niles, whom he finds lost and despairing. Niles breaks his leg in a fall, and, fearing for their lives, the two resolve to start a fire in order to signal Jumal. They burn a wooden coffin and unroll the wrappings of the mummified woman inside, where they discover the box of seeds. Despite strong reservations, Forsyth throws the mummy on the fire at Niles's command, before deciphering a piece of parchment which identifies the woman as a powerful sorceress who has vowed to curse anyone who dares disturb her grave. Forsyth keeps the box as a "souvenir" and Jumal rescues the hapless explorers, who have lost consciousness from the fumes.

Evelyn asks to plant the seeds, but Forsyth throws them into the fireplace, fearing that they may be cursed or poisonous. He reveals that Niles has had bad luck since his return, but the happy lovers do not think much of it. Three months later, Forsyth remarks to Evelyn on their wedding day that she has grown frail and sickly. She confides that she feels she is dying, but he dismisses her ailment as bridal nerves. He reveals that one seed has escaped the fire after all, and after being sent to Niles, it has bloomed into an unusual white flower. She surprises him by revealing that she has grown her own strange flower in her boudoir, and that she intends to wear it during the wedding, which he cautions against. She appears at the ceremony with renewed vivacity, but later falls into a swoon, revealing the flower pinned to her breast. An urgent letter arrives from a friend of Niles's, bringing news of the professor's death after wearing his own flower, which was later pronounced to be a lethal poison which drains the vitality of the wearer. Evelyn falls into a catatonic state of "death in life," and Forsyth secludes himself to tend to his insensate wife.

==Characters==
* Paul Forsyth: A man haunted by a recent misadventure in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Pyramid of Cheops]]
* Evelyn: Forsyth's charming young bride-to-be, whose romantic curiosity about "weird stories" ultimately becomes her downfall
* Professor Niles: A fanatical explorer who risks grave danger in his pursuit of ancient artifacts
* Jumal: Forsyth and Niles's Egyptian guide

==Critical reception==
Like most of Alcott's sensation fiction, "Lost in a Pyramid" received little attention throughout most of the twentieth century. Rediscovering the story in the late 1990s, Dominic Montserrat believed Alcott to be the first to use to utilize a fully fleshed-out "mummy's curse" narrative.&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/331404/The_rape_of_the_mummy_women_horror_fiction_and_the_Westernisation_of_the_curse Day, Jasmine. "The Rape of the Mummy: Women, Horror Fiction and the Westernisation of the Curse"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gregory Eiselein and Anne K. Phillips suggest that Alcott follows the plot of [[Theophile Gauthier]]'s  "[[The Mummy's Foot]]" (1847), conceding that the story is "an unusually early and female-authored example of the Egyptianizing thriller later dominated by male writers such as [[Bram Stoker]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], and [[H. Rider Haggard]]."&lt;ref name="LMAE" /&gt;

Conversely, Jasmine Day argues that the tradition in which Alcott writes was not always so male-centric, pointing to the anonymously published story "The Mummy's Soul" (1862) and [[Jane G. Austin]]'s "After Three Thousand Years" (1868), where female mummies exact revenge on male desecrators. Day proposes that along with Alcott's, these [[protofeminism|protofeminist]] curse stories establish "an analogy between desecration of tombs and rape."&lt;ref name="Day" /&gt;

'''Mobilian Jargon''' (also '''Mobilian trade language''', '''Mobilian Trade Jargon''', '''Chickasaw–Choctaw trade language''', '''Yamá''') was a [[pidgin]] used as a [[lingua franca]] among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups living along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] around the time of European settlement of the region.   It was the main language among Indian tribes in this area, mainly Louisiana. There is evidence indicating its existence as early as the late 17th to early 18th century. The Indian groups that are said to have used it were the [[Alabama people|Alabama]], [[Apalachee]], [[Biloxi]], [[Chacato]], Pakana, [[Pascagoula]], [[Taensa]], [[Tunica people|Tunica]], [[Caddo]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Chitimacha]], [[Natchez people|Natchez]], and [[Mosopelea|Ofo]]. The name is thought to refer to the Mobile Indians of the central Gulf Coast, but did not originate from this group; Mobilian Jargon is linguistically and grammatically different from the language traditionally spoken by the Mobile Indians.

Mobilian Jargon facilitated trade between tribes speaking different languages and European settlers.  There is continuing debate as to when Mobilian Jargon first began to be spoken. Some scholars, such as James Crawford, have argued that Mobilian Jargon has its origins in the linguistically diverse environment following the establishment of the [[France|French]] colony of [[Louisiana]]. Others, however, suggest that the already linguistically diverse environment of the lower [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] basin drove the need for a common method of communication prior to regular contact with Europeans.

The Native Americans of the Gulf coast and Mississippi valley have always spoken multiple languages, mainly the languages of the other tribes that inhabited the same area. The Mobilians, like these neighboring tribes, were also multi-lingual.  By the early 19th century, Mobilian Jargon evolved from functioning solely as a contact language between people into a means of personal identification.  With an increasing presence of outsiders in the Indian Gulf coast community, Mobilian Jargon served as a way of knowing who was truly a native of the area, and allowed Mobilians to be socially isolated from non-Indian population expansion from the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = | author = Drechsel, Emanuel | year = 1996 | title = An Integrated Vocabulary of Mobilian Jargon, a Native American Pidgin of the Mississippi Valley | url = | journal = Anthropological Linguistics | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 248–354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Mobilian was used from the [[Florida]] northwest coast and area of the current [[Alabama]]-[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] border westward as far as eastern [[Texas]] and in the north from the lower [[Mississippi Valley]] (currently south and central [[Illinois]]) to the southern [[Mississippi River Delta]] region in the south.  It is known to have been used by the Alabama, Apalachee, Biloxi, Chacato, Pakana, Pascagoula, Taensa, Tunica, Caddo, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Chitimacha, Natchez, and Ofo. Although, there is some evidence that Mobilian Jargon was used about 500 miles upstream the Missouri River near the Oyo or Osage Indians during the late 18th century. Some scholars also have reason to believe that the language was used or somehow came in contact with groups using the Algonquian languages of the Northeast to Midwest, with which Mobilian Jargon shares a number of words, such as papo(s) or papoš, meaning 'baby, child', which undeniably resembles the Narragansett word with the same meaning, pápūs. It is unknown how the crossover between the languages occurred; some possibilities include direct contact with Algonquian-speaking peoples in Virginia and North Carolina, or perhaps contact with French explorers using the Algonquian language at the time. Other Europeans also learned the language, but not in a way where they understood the cultural aspects of it; just enough for them to be able to trade with the Indians.

==Origins==
The accepted view of the origin is that it developed from contact with the French in the 18th century. But there is obscurity in that. It seems that there was a pre-European origin that is supported through its well-established use in diverse indigenous contexts, geographic overlapping with that of Southeastern Indian groups formerly associated in multilingual paramount chiefdoms of the pre-Columbian Mississippian Complex, and its indigenous grammar. Mobilian Jargon has a recorded history of at least 250 years where the first reliable evidence dated 1700. For two centuries it was socially accepted to use as a lingua franca with the outsiders they interacted with, such as traders and settlers. It is presumed that fur traders spread the language to Choctaw and Chickasaw provinces. Though Indians spoke in Mobilian Jargon to outsiders, the outsiders did not have a full understanding of how special the nature and functions of Mobilian Jargon was. Because of this, the Indians created a cultural barrier, preserving their cultural integrity and privacy from non-Indian groups. The pervasiveness of Mobilian Jargon, as a result, created its longtime survival.

Mobilian Jargon is a pidginized or "corrupted"/"complex" form of [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw language|Chickasaw]] (both Western [[Muskogean]]) that also contains elements of Eastern Muskogean languages such as [[Alabama language|Alabama]] and [[Koasati]], colonial languages including [[Spanish language|Spanish]],  [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]], and perhaps [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] and/or other languages. [[Pamela Munro]] has argued that Choctaw is the major contributing language (not both Choctaw and Chickasaw) although this has been challenged by Emanuel Drechsel. He has concluded that the presence of certain Algonquian words in Mobilian Jargon are the result of direct contact between the Mobilians of the Mississippi valley and [[Algonquins]] moving southward.  For the most part, these "loanwords" differ by only one or two letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/465906| author = Drechsel, Emanuel | year = 1985 | title = Algonquian Loanwords in Mobilian Jargon | url = | journal = International Journal of American Linguistics | volume = 51 | issue = 4| pages = 393–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
In its syntax, Mobilian Jargon was fundamentally Muskogean and compared to other southeastern Indian tribes it showed a reduced morphology. Its lexicon shares major similarities to other Muskogean languages, in particular to Chickasaw and to Alabama. Though it evolved from more complex and polysynthetic Native American languages, Mobilian Jargon has a simpler structure where verbs are not required to have subject or object affixes and the subject-object-verb ordering in the sentence is variable. It also requires a separate word after the verb to indicate tense, whereas Muskogean languages use a suffix. It has a simplified syllable and sound structure and a simplified grammar as compared to Choctaw, its primary parent language. Mobilian Jargon was  at one point a Muskogean- based pidgin. It was linguistically reduced from analytical grammar. Mobilian Jargon related to Muskogean proper linguistics and historical facts. Mobilians used a lot of Western Muskogean in their spoken language. Compare the [[personal pronoun]]s among Muskogean languages:

== Revitalization ==

The extinct language has not made its way into the present day as a functional language. Europeans did not feel much of a need to document the language. There is documentary evidence in numerous historical records such as journals, diaries, reports and scholarly treatments. What Europeans did decide to document though was very little and safe to assume that they did not have a full understanding of Mobilian Jargon. Europeans believed that Mobilian Jargon was the "mother" language of all other Indian languages, due to their lack of observation that Mobilian Jargon was actually a hybrid of the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribe’s language. Since it was mainly used as a spoken trade language, its use as a language became unnecessary; the language was lost and eventually became extinct. Though Mobilian was first written about in the 1700s and was spoken until the 1950s, in the 1980s elders in the region of Louisiana could still recall a few select words and phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drechsel|first=Emanuel|title=An Integrated Vocabulary of Mobilian Jargon, a Native American Pidgin of the Mississippi Valley|year=1996|publisher=The Trustees of Indiana University|pages=248–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the [[Mezcal Jazz Unit]] of [[Montpellier]], France, collaborated by Internet with Grayhawk Perkins, a historian of the [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean nation]], to make a recording titled ''Thirteen Moons'' which features "the soulful chants of ancient folk tales and more modern stories told in Mobilian."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The '''National Conference on Undergraduate Research''' (NCUR) was established in 1987 at the University of North Carolina at Asheville to promote [[undergraduate research]] in universities throughout the [[United States]]. Undergraduate students are invited to submit abstracts to present their work at NCUR, which is currently one of the events sponsored by the [[Council on Undergraduate Research]] (CUR) umbrella organization.

==Mission==
The mission of the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) is to promote [[undergraduate research]] scholarship and creative activity done in partnership with faculty or other mentors as a vital component of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cur.org/ncur_2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of NCUR and Association with CUR ==
The National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) was established at University of North Carolina at Asheville in 1987 with 400 students from campuses countrywide presenting their work. From its inception, NCUR included students from the sciences, the arts, the humanities, and the social sciences.  Students were encouraged to present their work in collaboration with faculty members in a variety of media and formats from posters to performances. NCUR continued and expanded, beginning to move to different campus hosts in 1989. Currently approximately 4000 students participate annually, drawn from all fields and from any college or university. The [[Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR]]) was established in 1987 also with a focus on faculty chemistry research at primarily undergraduate institutions that included the students as co-investigators with their faculty mentors.  Over time, CUR welcomed other sciences and then non-sciences and also added an At Large group.  The two organizations co-existed until 2010 when they decided to combine forces.  Currently, the combined organization is called CUR and it sponsors a NCUR each year.

'''New Hampshire State Prison for Men''' (NHSPM) is a [[New Hampshire Department of Corrections]] [[prison]] in [[New Hampshire]], [[United States]].  Located in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], it is equipped to accept maximum, medium, and minimum security prisoners.

Opened in 1878 to replace an earlier prison built in 1812, State Prison for Men is the State of New Hampshire's oldest prison facility. Renovated and expanded in the 1980s, it includes a 60-bed secure psychiatric unit/residential treatment unit, and is the only facility operated by the [[New Hampshire Department of Corrections]] which houses maximum security male prisoners.

The New Hampshire Corrections Special School District operates a high school within this facility, which provides both a high school diploma or the [[G.E.D.]]  

A full-time health services center including dental and long term health care wing is operated within this facility and is capable of housing both male and female prisoners in need of long term, chronic, or terminal care.

Eighteen wardens have run this facility since it opened in 1878.

[[File:Pacatnamu walls.jpg|thumb|Pacatnamu archaeological site, Peru.]]

The '''Pacatnamu''' site is located at the mouth of the [[Jequetepeque Valley]] on the northern coast of [[Peru]]. Rocky cliffs protect two of its sides and a manmade wall protects the third. This area of Peru does not have a tropical environment; it gets very little precipitation and has a mild climate, which sometime can become very humid.

== Excavation history ==
[[File:Pacatnamu landscape.jpg|thumb|Pacatnamu landscape.]]
Explorers had mentioned the site of Pacatnamu since the late 1800s, but the site was not studied in detail until 1925. [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Kroeber]] made some sketches of the main architectural features of the site but only of one portion of the site. [[Archaeological excavations]] first began in 1937–39 by German archaeologist, Ubbelohde-Doering. He conducted more excavations in 1952–53 and again in 1962–63. His work resulted in more excavations of more pyramid complexes.

Wolfgang and Giesela Hecker joined Ubbelohde-Doering on his 1962–63 excavations. They produced a general map of the site as a whole as well as some detailed maps of the architectural features. Richard Keatinge conducted an extensive surface survey in 1974 and published several brief reports on his findings. In 1983 the Instituto Nacional de Cultura in Lima approved the Museum of Cultural History at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] request to do a five-year excavation permit at Pacatanamu. This excavation was extremely successful and from their research they produced hundreds of artifacts and created a chronology of occupation for the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Donnan |first1=Christopher B. |last2=Cock |first2=Guillermo A. |year=1986 |title=Pacatnamu Papers Volume One and Two.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
There are two periods of occupation-an early period when [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] ceramics were in use, and a later period characterized by the use of [[Chimu]] ceramics. Brick serration used in construction allows us to see a chronology of occupation with in each of those times of occupation. Pacatnamu was unoccupied before the end of Moche IV or the beginning of the Moche V (ca. A.D. 600). During this Moche period some ceremonial architecture was constructed. During this time of occupation ceramics clearly show some [[Huari culture|Huari]] influence, but the textiles are clearly Moche. Also the burials from this time simply reflect Moche styles. Near the end of Moche occupation (ca. A.D. 900) a new ceramic for was added and this has clearly signaled the end of the Moche occupation. In approximately A.D. 1050 there is a break between the Moche occupation and Chimu occupation.

This period coincides with extensive flooding in this area and a dramatic change in nearly all artifact types. Around A.D. 1100–1150 there was another large population living in Pacatnamu with a new style of ceramics, textiles and bricks, and new architectural forms that help us date the sites occupational periods. The second outbreak of population is known as the Chimu occupation. Major walls were built at this time because of a need for defense. There is a bit of unfinished wall to the north, which suggests they were trying to expand near the end of their occupation. Not much is known about why the Chimu occupation ended but it happened sometime around A.D. 1370. It is possible that more populations occupied Pacatnamu after 1370, but by the time the Inca conquered the North Coast the site was mostly in ruins.

== Agriculture and economy ==

It is possible that more populations occupied Pacatnamu after 1370, but by the time the [[Inca]] conquered the North Coast the site was mostly in ruins.

=== Evidence of animal use ===
[[Llama]] proved to be an important animal at Pacatnamu both for everyday use and ritualistic purposes. Their bones are found in many burials throughout the site. The [[black vulture]] was also an important animal of religious life at Pacatnamu; its bones are often found with mass burials associated with ritualistic killings.

=== Trade ===
The site was one used for a pilgrimage site. There are good present from all over the nearby valley and spanning from many different occupational cultures, but there is no evidence of trade and there is repeated spiritual architecture and evidence of those buildings being used for much longer than other administrative buildings at the site. Otherwise there is no real evidence of a substantial economy. Ceramics, textiles, and some copper goods were things found at burials or religious centers throughout the city.

=== Specialization ===
Many of the buildings show detailed specialization, especially in the bricks, where it was necessary to specialize in making bricks. Textiles are very important to this society; they often show great specialization because of the varied array of weaving patterns and symbols (Hyer 1981). There are textiles found at almost every burial site. Also many buildings in the compound show use of textiles or evidence of textiles being made in the building itself. Pacatnamu has the largest number of Moche textiles found to date. (Donnan and Cock 1986) There is also evidence for bead and copper specialization. The textile business was completely dominated by the elite families, who all specialized in, to some degree, textile production.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Hyer |first=Sally |year=1981 |title=Textiles from Pacatnamu in Jequetepeque}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the peoples associated with being master fishermen were only part-time specialists because their households were usually found outside of the city walls and their refuse piles show an even variation between shellfish and other marine life and wildly collected plants. This suggests that these people spent equal time in fields and in the water working to supply the higher classes with food, but also trying to collect food for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gumerman |first=George |year=1994 |title=Feeding Specialists: The Effect of Specialization on Subsistence Variation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artifacts and agriculture ==

=== Architecture ===
Scholars disagree about what architectural style is most represented at Pacatnamu. The Moche and Chimu peoples are the two most usually associated with this site, but recently the [[Sican culture|Lambayeque]] group has been associated with Pacatnamu. Most of the archaeologists who work at Pacatnamu study the extensive wall system and the many [[huaca]]s, truncated [[pyramids]] with mound top structures). The largest Huaca is the compound Huaca 1, located in the central portion of the site. The site is found with many distinctions between right and left entrances.

Apparently this right-left dichotomy is found in many Chimu sites. The right hand entrances in Pacatnamu are more elaborate, easily accessible while the left is usually filled with debris and more closed off, leading to more domestic buildings where evidence of food preparation has been found. The right side has then been more associated with ceremonial uses and/ or administrative purposes. The architecture is more concerned with visual perception and movement rather than function also leading scholars to believe it was a religious center and not one intended for normal living conditions.
*Huaca 1
:: 70 × 70m 10m high. The areas around this complex include courtyards, a two-level mound named the East Pyramid, and a large enclosure filled with compels architecture known as the Major [[Quadrangle (architecture)|Quadrangle]]. Both Huaca 1 and the Quadrangle are associated with the Initial Chimu phase.
*Major quadrangle
:: 175 × 170m walls were originally 5m tall. There are three main hallways leaving this section the right hall is more architecturally complex and well organized. There is little debris visible, whereas the left entrance is smaller, less complex. Scholars believe this is evidence to Pacatnamu's past as a pilgrimage site. The right was more for ceremony, and/ or administrative purposed, and the left was for everyday use or food preparation. While the majority of this structure comes from the Initial Chimu Phase it also shows a lot of construction from the Terminal Chimu Phase.
*Complex A
:: Complex A is found leaving out of the West Corridor from the Major Quadrangle. It is notable for its audiencia and a textile fragment depicting a ceremony in progress.
*Audiencia
:: Contains three Disturbed Burial chambers and an amazing collection of miniature ceramics and 93 miniature textiles, tine [[ponchos]], loincloths, and a crown.
*Complex E
:: Is found leaving the central pathway towards the entrance gate of the site. The archaeologists found layers of plaster, which suggest a storage facility for ceremonial wood artifacts, adding more evidence that this was primarily a religious center.
*Funerary mound (H1M1?)
:: Located in the southwestern corner of the Major Quadrangle. It was built using case-and-fill construction and is approximately 30m in diameter and 2.5&amp;nbsp;m tall.
*Huaca 31 &amp; associated structures
:: Construction of these structures span the entire history of occupation, but they feature Classic Moche Bricks (flat rectangular) *N. Wall Built with, to a degree, Terminal Chimu Phase bricks (Flat-Bottomed ovoid shape)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moore |first=Jerry |year=1996 |title=Architecture and Power in the Ancient Andes: The Archaeology of public buildings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership and inequality ==
The structure of leadership at Pacatnamu is hard to determine because many archaeologists believe it was strictly a ceremonial or pilgrimage site, however Gumerman mentions that some of her research indicates that the elite of Pacatnamu were considered administrative and ritual specialists who were removed from subsistence production. This means the nobility had a place in a governmental/ ritualistic power over others. Some architectural features throughout the site show that peoples of higher rank in the over arching Chimu or Moche culture would come here for ceremonies, so there are special place for them, but there are no names of documents available stating direct leadership in the site of Pacatnamu. In general the architecture throughout the site is an indication of wealth and power differences; the more powerful received grander styles of monumental architecture while the commoners had a very common plain style of architecture.

There are no sources indicating that the site of Pacatnamu had a centralized government or leadership system, therefore many archaeologists believe Pacatnamu was a part of a greater civilization. Later periods of occupation show the residence building defensive walls, but later research into those walls suggests that while one main reason for their construction is defense it isn't the only reason. The walls have many functions, but there needed many hands to help build them, so their construction may be because a lord or king asked for them to be built and sent peasants to do the labor.

The building of the sites many walls suggests that there was an actual need for defense or whomever controlled the site perceived a threat, either way there have to be an army to help defend the city should it be attacked. While there is no documentation of a physical army or a battle happening at Pacatnamu the walls suggest that a height standing person asked for them because they could with their status and therefore there must have also been an army to help protect those walls.

The architecture of the site has been studied extensively and many of the large courtyards throughout the site have a right-left oriented structure. For Pacatnamu the more grandiose buildings with more ceremonial artifacts are found down hallways towards the right while down the left side hallways we find more debris less monumental structures. These left side hallways usually lead to areas that were used for storage or food preparation. The main monumental pyramid, Huaca 1, is surrounded by high walls that completely block the view of the mound from view, these walls have been speculated to keep those who were not allowed to know about or join in on the ceremonies, so this creates a hierarchy of those who can participate and know what's going on and those who cannot. The variation of artifacts throughout the site indicates that those of higher rank had more specialized and unique items and more complex architectural buildings were as the commoners had non-monumental structures and less fine wear beads and textiles.

Many of the studied burials at Pacatnamu have lots of [[grave goods]] such as, textiles, ceramics, sacrifices, copper and more. There isn't much differentiation between burials in terms of what's found in them, but some people are buried closer to ceremonial buildings like Huaca 1 and there are some people actually buried within the pyramid itself so that sets them apart from other people. All the burials at Pacatnamu have textiles, which were very important to this culture, ceramics, and copper. Lama sacrifices were important for ceremonies and are rare to find in burials, but there is evidence of this. The textiles found rage in their preservation and the overall quality of the item, the most impressive textiles are associated with people with more status, but there isn't anything else in the burials alerting us to the person’s identity.

Many of the burials at Pacatnamu have been looted so many of the skeletons have been badly damaged. In many all that kind be determined is the age of the person, but not their sex. Around the entrance of Huaca 1 is found a mass burial of mutilated young men. There are three separate burials all on top of one another; each burial was done at a different time. All 14 of the bodies found are of men around the age of 14, many of them died by multiple stab wounds to the chest and back region and it's speculated that multiple people did the stabbing. It's hard to determine why exactly these individuals met with this end, but it may have been part of a ceremony because it's obvious these individuals were not chosen at random. According to ethnohistoric evidence we know that some people accused of rebellion in Incan culture had many different punishments and many of these individuals share these injuries.

== Religion and ideology ==
"Pacatnamu offers "laboratory conditions" for the study of the art, architecture, and population of a major religious center shaped by the dynamics of local development and foreign conquest." - Christopher B. Donnan

Throughout the history of Pacatnamu many archaeologists believed it to be a major ceremonial and pilgrimage center for the Jequetepeque valley as a whole, but new evidence suggests that Pacatnamu was likely only used for ceremonies and for political and administrative uses and not for pilgrimages because of the lack of ceramics from the larger [[Jequetepeque Valley|Jequetepeque valley]] and the burials in Pacatnamu suggest only the immediate residents and not a larger population of people. There are no written records from Pacatnamu even after Spanish colonial expansion. By the time the Incas controlled much of Peru the site was already in ruins. Much of its specific history still remains mostly a mystery to us.

Overall the general architecture from the Moche period leads us to believe it was a ceremonial or administrative center. There is monumental architecture, which demonstrates that it was the place of many ritual and ceremonies. The only evidence of rituals or ceremonies the offering room and the ritual burial near one of the defensive walls, mentioned earlier.
The offering room confused archaeologists when it was first discovered in 1984. It was discovered in the Huaca 1complexe. There were two other rooms connected to it, but they were both completely empty except for room 3, the actual site of the ritual. The room was very full of artifacts including ceramics, bone (both human and [[camelid]]), metal, textile, shell, and organic residue. The whole room showed evidence of being burned once all the artifacts had been stored inside. Before this discovery the archaeologists had never encountered this ritual, but in 1995 at the site of Dos Cabezas there was a similar room found with almost exactly the same items inside of it.

There is already a tradition in Peru of burning offering so to give them to the gods instead of keeping them on earth. The Incas often burned textiles every morning to begin the day making the gods happy.

In Pacatnamu there isn't sufficient evidence to name or actually identify persons of higher ranking, such as kings or priests, but there are a few graves North of Huaca 31 that have evidence of high status people. We have no evidence about specific gods that the people of Pacatnamu believed in.

== Death ==

=== Treatment of the body ===
The burials in Pacatnamu do not show much variation between the sexes, but there is a small degree of variation when it comes to children's burials. We do not have sufficient evidence to tell for sure whether or not the peoples of Pacatnamu fit in with the traditional burial techniques of Peruvian ancients, but the Spanish noted that when a village member would die they would be mourned for five days then washes and prepared for burial. The bodies in Pacatnamu show great preservation, but we have no evidence of this practice in Pacatnamu. Women and girls usually have their hair brained, but overall most people are found with their hands and feet wrapped in yarn.

Their faces are not always but usually covered in cloth; clothing is also usually present, but this material does not always preserve so we have no way of telling if only some people were buried with clothing or all of them. Textiles are a constant in all burials in Pacatnamu. Donnan and Cock mentioned that the only elite class burial is north of Huaca 31 otherwise all other graves show signs of being those of common people. (Donnan and Cock 1986) Elite peoples were buried in a series around Huaca 31 during the late intermediate period while during the same time frame a large number of common burials were found elsewhere at the site, but the ratio of elites to commoners is more in the favor of the commoners. Their graves are found most often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Margaret |year=2008 |title=Fauna and Ritual at the Moche sites of El Brujo and Pacatnamu, Peru.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are five different ways a body can be encased:
*Shroud Wrap
*Splint Reinforced
*Cane Frame
*Cane Tube
*Cane Coffin

=== Burial goods ===

====Ceramics====
Were found in both adult male and female burials. Ceramics are a very constant burial good and artifact all across the site.
Gourds: [[Gourds]] were used to hold organic goods like [[corncobs]] and other agricultural crops although the people of Pacatnamu ate marine life their burial goods were usually agricultural crops like corn and [[quinoa]]. Gourds are more common than ceramics in burials.

====Plants====
Left out in the open plant life is seldom found, most of the data the archaeologist have found come from gourds.

====Animals====
Animal bones are found in most adult male and female burials, but usually only pieces of the animal, there is only one burial that has a complete llama skeleton. Other animals that have been found include: Fish, [[Guinea pig]]s, and birds.

====Metal====
Copper is found in all burials non-dependent on size or sex.

====Decorative elements====
*Ear ornaments
These are only found in adult female burials.
*Beads
Found in almost all burials, throughout all ages and non-determinate on sex.
*Feathered Headdress
Only one of these was found in Pacatnamu. In other Moche sites feathered headdresses have appeared and are usually associated with high standing priests, but in this case the archaeologists believe this is not the case for the Pacatnamu one because instead of being made in copper it is made with bone and of lesser quality, so this is probably a common individuals try and making this type of artifact.
*Textiles
These are the most common burial good; they are found in all graves, but men usually have more than women.
*Spindle Whorls
Only found in graves of adult women.
*Net Spacers
Only found in graves of adult men, these are significant to fishing practices.

=== Disease and trauma ===

====Degenerative Joint Disease ([[Osteoarthritis]])====
Mostly found in older people in their hips, knees, shoulders, and elbows. Usually associated with regular life stresses on the body. When found in the shoulders and elbows it suggests lots of upper body labor and when found in the back, knees and hips it suggests lots of lower body lifting and kneeling.

====[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]====
Harder to detect than normal arthritis, but the archaeologists are confident they have found minimal skeletal evidence of it.

====[[Dental pathology]]====
Most common people faced usually present with tooth loss and disease. This caused the most day-to-day pain the people of Pacatnamu suffered. This is usually associated with the diet of those living in Pacatnamu, while it was nutritious and well balanced; it was very damaging to their teeth.

====Trauma====
Fractures and dislocations were very uncommon in Pacatnamu, but the archaeologists found two examples of previously healed fractures, one case of multiple unhealed fractures and one case of a severe spinal injury, it was a skeleton belonging to a middle aged woman whose spine fractured at a 90&amp;nbsp;degree angle they stabilized the fracture and kept her at that angle for the rest of her life. Her knees showed some sings of stress and the archaeologists agree she continued to move around and function after the injury. There was also one case of an extensive injury to an adult males left eye; it is likely he lost the use of this eye in response to the injury or infection. (Donnan and Cock 1986)
The archaeologists found two cases of tumors both were most likely benign and [[cartilaginous]] in nature. The first example was discovered in a young male's [[femur]] the second case was found in a male's left thumb, it was growing in the bone shaft, this is known as [[Chondroma]].

====Developmental Anomalies====
#The head of the left radius bone in an adult female: [[Articular surface]] of the bone was convex rather than concave, the bones surrounding this were deformed themselves to make room for the deformity.
#The right [[humerus]] of an adult male was much shorter than the left and his head was very deformed. The left side of his face around the [[occiput|occipital]] region was much larger than the right side of his skull.
#Female spine deformity known as a "butterfly" [[vertebrate]].

== Warfare and violence ==
Although in the later periods of occupation the Chimu people built an extensive wall system it has been argued that the main point of these walls was not in fact for protection because of the many doors built into the walls. It is obvious thought that the Chimu were expanding Pacatnamu. There is no evidence of warfare specifically, but the mass burial of young men may be an indication that there was a small battle or the mass burial was for strictly religious purposes.
Pacatnamu has no written documents to make a historical chronology off of, even once the Spanish arrived they never mention Pacatnamu, this is likely because when they arrive the site is already in ruins and abandoned.

== Writing system, art, and symbolism ==
There was no writing system used in Pacatnamu, so we have no documents or written records to research, but textiles were an extremely important feature of the cultures of Peru and South America. Many of these textiles depict important rituals and ceremonies so they can almost be interpreted as a written document in a more artistic form.

===Symbols===
Animals were very important to the culture in Pacatnamu, the black vulture and llamas show up frequently in the textiles. They obviously not only had an important impact on everyday life, with labor and food, but they both hold significant religious properties. Usually in textiles that are depicting a religious ceremony there is one person who appears to be more refined, the one who is probably in charge of the ceremony, but there is no indication about who this person actually is.

Hyer details the differences between the many different types of weave that could be used to weave a particular textile. Some designated a finer piece of material. One of the tombs found during the Moche IV holds the remains of an adult female, who is possibly a priestess. She was placed in a cane [[sarcophagus]], or the cane coffin method mentioned above. Buried with her were a series of juvenile camelid placed around the head and feet of other juvenile camelids along with other offerings. There are many burial sites that have camelid bones as offerings this makes it clear that llama were indeed a very important part of the ritual aspect of Moche society.
*Plain weave
*Tapestry weave
*Alternating float weave
*Gauze
*Openwork
*Twill
*Complementary weft
*Supplementary warp and weft

Wool yarn is the most used for weaving and usually makes the finest material. For grave textiles they were usually done in cotton and wool weft, supplementary weft float pattering and plain weave techniques. These patterns are also found throughout the coastal regions of Peru.

== End of occupation ==
The date usually given for the end of the main period of occupation of Pacatnamu is around A.D 1370. Donnan and Cock speculate that there was probably a small group of people who continued to live there, but it was not very extensive. The majority of the population probably left in response to the Chimu conquest of the lower Jequetepeque Valley whose capital was at [[Chan Chan]]. Although there was a small group of people in Pacatnamu during this period by the time the Inca conquered the northern coast (A.D 1470) the site of Pacatnamu was empty.

There is no indication of why the people finally decided to leave for good, but the site still had significance to outsiders, there is some evidence that people went back and had small ceremonies there, but these were probably only a few families and by no means was it a pilgrimage center. Offerings still appear during the early part of the colonial period, but after this time the site loses its use because no colonial documents note its location or significance.

A '''plant epithet''' is a name used to label a person or group, by association with some perceived quality of a [[plant]]. [[Vegetable]] [[epithet]]s may be [[pejorative]], such as [[turnip]] readily giving offence, or positive, such as the [[rose]] or other [[flower]]s implying beauty. [[Tree]] and flower forenames such as Hazel, Holly, Jasmine and Rose are commonly given to girls. Tree surnames such as Oakes (Oak) and Nash (Ash) are [[toponym]]ic, given to a person in the [[Middle Ages]] who lived in a place near a conspicuous tree. A few plant surnames such as Pease and Onions are [[metonym]]ic, for sellers of [[pea]]s and [[onion]]s respectively. Finally, plant surnames are sometimes [[emblem]]atic, as in the name Rose, used as a family emblem.

==Vegetable insults==

Plant epithets may be [[pejorative]], used humorously and sometimes offensively. Some plant epithets are used directly as insults, as when people are called [[turnip]]s, [[potato]]es, or [[cabbage]]s.&lt;ref name=Dunlop/&gt; When the [[England football team]] lost to [[Sweden football team|Sweden]] under [[Graham Taylor]], ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper led with the headline "Swedes 2 Turnips 1", swede being a pun on [[rutabaga|a particular vegetable]], and turnip being an insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=England: The Official F.A History |author=Edworthy, Niall |publisher=Virgin |date=1997 |isbn=1-85227-699-1 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In English the collective term [[vegetable]] is also pejorative. Plant epithets are used around the world, but the choice of plants and their meanings vary. Thus in China, "stupid melon" is used as an insult.&lt;ref name=Dunlop&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dunlop |first1=Fuchsia |title=You turnip! Vegetable insults around the world |url=http://www.fuchsiadunlop.com/you-turnip-vegetable-insults-around-the-world/ |accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, [[coconut]] is sometimes used by black people [[List of ethnic slurs|to insult other coloured people]]; the term indicates betrayal, as coconuts are brown on the outside but white on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grice |first1=Elizabeth |title=Was it necessary to turn an insult involving coconuts into a criminal prosecution? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7862137/Was-it-necessary-to-turn-an-insult-involving-coconuts-into-a-criminal-prosecution.html |accessdate=25 July 2016 |agency=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trembling or quaking like an [[aspen]] leaf means shaking with fear; this may be descriptive or pejorative, and is recorded from around 1700 onwards, starting with [[Edward Taylor]]'s ''Poems''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whiting |first=Bartlett Jere |title=Early American Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuvqPkAq2bkC&amp;pg=PA13 |year=1977 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-21981-6 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flower and tree names==
[[File:Lorbeerkranz Zypern rem.jpg|thumb|The [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] symbolised victory in Ancient Greece and Rome in the form of a wreath, leading to its use as a name. [[Gold]]en laurel wreath, probably from Cyprus, 4th/3rd century BC]]

In contrast to vegetable epithets, [[flower]] and [[tree]] names are generally positive. [[English rose (epithet)|"English rose"]] has traditionally been used to describe an attractive English woman with a [[light skin|fair complexion]]. An early documented usage is in [[Basil Hood]]'s 1902 [[comic opera]] ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dent |first1=edited by Susie |title=Brewer's dictionary of phrase &amp; fable |date=2012 |publisher=Chambers |isbn=978-0-550-10245-4 |page=445 |edition=19th}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in modern times, the actress [[Gemma Arterton]] has been so described.&lt;ref name=EnglishRose/&gt;

Flower and tree names are used in many countries for girls; examples in English include [[Bryony]], [[Bellis perennis|Daisy]], [[Iris (plant)|Iris]], [[Hazel]], [[Calluna vulgaris|Heather]], [[Holly]], [[Hyacinth (plant)|Hyacinth]], [[Jasmine]], [[Lily]], [[Rose]], and [[Viola (plant)|Violet]]. Forms of the generic term flower are also popular, including for example Fleur, Flora, Florence and Flores,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flower Names for Girls and Boys|url=http://www.parents.com/baby-names/flower-girl-and-boy/|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girl Flower Names|url=http://www.top-100-baby-names-search.com/girl-flower-names.html|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other languages Anthea, Blodwen, Kveta, Leilani, and Zahrah.&lt;ref name=BBN/&gt; English flower names are less common for boys, but include [[Crataegus|Hawthorn]]; in the form of May, the same flower is used as a girl's name.&lt;ref name=BBN&gt;{{cite web |title=May Names |url=http://www.britishbabynames.com/blog/2012/05/may-names.html |publisher=British Baby Names |accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurel (given name)|Laurel]], for a victor's [[wreath]] made of [[Laurus nobilis|the sweet bay or laurel]], with feminine forms such as Laura, is used for both boys and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laurel|url=http://www.babynames.co.uk/names/laurel/|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant surnames==

People acquired plant surnames in the [[Middle Ages]] for different reasons. [[Toponym]]ic surnames were given to people who lived by a significant feature such as a large isolated tree, a group of trees, or a wood: or, very often, in a village beside such a feature. [[Metonym]]ic surnames, on the other hand, denoted a person's profession, and include Pease, for a seller of [[pea]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 343&lt;/ref&gt; and Onions, for a seller of [[onion]]s (though some people with that surname got it from the Old Welsh name Enniaum).&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 330&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Robert Plant at the Palace Theatre, Manchester.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Robert Plant]], lead singer of [[Led Zeppelin]]. The surname may be metonymic for a gardener or toponymic for an orchard or a town in France.]]

Plant or Plante itself may be a metonym (gardener), as with Plantebene (a grower of beans, 1199) and Planterose (a grower of roses, 1221), a metaphor meaning a branch of a family, or a toponym, as with de la Plaunt (1273) and de Plantes (1275, 1282), from a place in France such as [[Le Plantis|le Plantis]] ([[Orne]]), or from a planted place such as a vineyard or orchard.&lt;ref name="Hanks"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hanks |first1=Patrick |last2=Coates |first2=Richard |last3=McClure |first3=Peter |date=2016 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-967776-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Plant&gt;{{cite web |title=Last Name: Plant |url=http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Plant |publisher=The Internet Surname Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 354&lt;/ref&gt;

Toponymic surnames include [[Oak]], with variants such as Oake, Oke, Oakes, Noke and Roke since 1273,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Last name: Oak |url=http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Oak |publisher=The Internet Surname Database |accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 327&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fraxinus|Ash]], with variations such as Ashe, Asche, Aish, Esch and Nash since 1221,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Last Name: Ash |url=http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Ash |publisher=The Internet Surname Database |accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Birch]] or Birchwood, since 1182.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hazel]] is recorded in many toponymic surnames (sometimes via villages named for the tree), including Hazel itself from 1182, Hazelwood/Aizlewood, Hazelton, Hazelhurst, Hazelgrove, Hazelden and Heseltine.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; Surnames such as Hollies and Hollin(g)s, since 1275, mean a person who lived by a [[holly]] or [[holm oak]] tree.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 235–236&lt;/ref&gt; Surnames such as Plumtree, Plumpton, and Plumstead denote people who lived in places by a [[plum]] tree or [[orchard]].&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, page 260&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Appleby, Appleton, Applegarth and Appleyard name people who lived by an [[apple]] orchard, or in villages in Cheshire, Cumbria, Kent and Yorkshire which were named for their apple orchards.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Surnames including Apps, Asp, Epps and Hesp record that a person lived by an [[aspen]] tree, the letters often being [[Metathesis (linguistics)|swapped over]].&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - Proserpine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]'', 1874, by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], portrayed by [[Jane Morris]]]]
The '''Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood ''' (later known as the '''Pre-Raphaelites''') was a group of [[England|English]] [[Painting|painter]]s, [[poets]], and [[art critic]]s, founded in 1848 by [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The three founders were joined by [[William Michael Rossetti]], [[James Collinson]], [[Frederic George Stephens]] and [[Thomas Woolner]] to form the seven-member "brotherhood". Their principles were shared by other artists, including [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]] and [[Marie Spartali Stillman]].

A later, medievalising strain inspired by Rossetti included [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and extended into the twentieth century with artists such as [[John William Waterhouse]].

The group's intention was to reform art by rejecting what it considered the mechanistic approach first adopted by [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists who succeeded [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]]. Its members believed the [[Classicism|Classical]] poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the [[academic art|academic]] teaching of art, hence the name "Pre-Raphaelite". In particular, the group objected to the influence of [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], founder of the English [[Royal Academy of Arts]], whom they called "Sir Sloshua". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, "sloshy" meant "anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Timothy (1970).  ''The Pre-Raphaelites'', p. 46.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The brotherhood sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions of [[Quattrocento]] Italian art. The group associated their work with [[John Ruskin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landow|first1=George P.|title=Pre-Raphaelites: An Introduction|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb/1.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an English critic whose influences were driven by his religious background.

The group continued to accept the concepts of [[history painting]] and [[mimesis]], imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. The Pre-Raphaelites defined themselves as a reform movement, created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]'', to promote their ideas. The group's debates were recorded in the ''Pre-Raphaelite Journal''.

==Beginnings==
[[File:Germ.jpg|thumb|Illustration by Holman Hunt of Thomas Woolner's poem "My Beautiful Lady", published in ''The Germ'', 1850]]
The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in John Millais's parents' house on [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], London in 1848. At the first meeting, the painters [[John Everett Millais]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[William Holman Hunt]] were present. Hunt and Millais were students at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and had met in another loose association, the Cyclographic Club, a sketching society. At his own request Rossetti became a pupil of [[Ford Madox Brown]] in 1848.&lt;ref name=McGann&gt;McGann, Jerome J. ''The Complete Writings and Pictures of Dante Gabriel Rossetti'', NINES consortium, Creative Commons License; http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/s40.rap.html retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At that date, Rossetti and Hunt shared lodgings in [[Cleveland Street, London|Cleveland Street]], [[Fitzrovia]], Central London. Hunt had started painting ''The Eve of St. Agnes'' based on [[The Eve of St. Agnes|Keats's poem of the same name]], but it was not completed until 1867.&lt;ref name=hilton28&gt;Hilton (1970), pp. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aspiring poet, Rossetti wished to develop the links between [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poetry and art. By autumn, four more members, painters [[James Collinson]] and [[Frederic George Stephens]], Rossetti's brother, poet and critic [[William Michael Rossetti]], and  sculptor [[Thomas Woolner]], had joined to form a seven-member-strong brotherhood.&lt;ref name=hilton28/&gt; Ford Madox Brown was invited to join, but the more senior artist remained independent but supported the group throughout the PRB period of Pre-Raphaelitism and contributed to ''The Germ''. Other young painters and sculptors became close associates, including [[Charles Allston Collins]], and [[Alexander Munro (sculptor)|Alexander Munro]]. The PRB intended to keep the existence of the brotherhood secret from members of the Royal Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hisour.com/art-movements/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood-1848-1855/|title=Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood 1848 - 1855 - HiSoUR Art Culture Exhibition|date=2017-02-22|work=HiSoUR Art Culture Exhibition|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early doctrines==
The brotherhood's early doctrines, as defined by William Michael Rossetti, were expressed in four declarations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# to have genuine ideas to express;
# to study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them;
# to sympathise with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading&lt;!-- "parading" NOT "parodying" --&gt; and learned by rote; and
# most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Latham, pp. 11-12; see also his comments&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principles were deliberately non-dogmatic, since the brotherhood wished to emphasise the personal responsibility of individual artists to determine their own ideas and methods of depiction. Influenced by [[Romanticism]], the members thought freedom and responsibility were inseparable. Nevertheless, they were particularly fascinated by [[medieval]] culture, believing it to possess a [[spirituality|spiritual]] and creative integrity that had been lost in later eras. The emphasis on medieval culture clashed with principles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] which stress the independent observation of nature. In its early stages, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood believed its two interests were consistent with one another, but in later years the movement divided and moved in two directions. The realists were led by Hunt and Millais, while the medievalists were led by Rossetti and his followers, [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[William Morris]]. The split was never absolute, since both factions believed that art was essentially spiritual in character, opposing their [[idealism]] to the [[materialism|materialist]] realism associated with [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Impressionism]].

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was greatly influenced by nature and its members used great detail to show the natural world using bright and sharp focus techniques on a white canvas. In attempts to revive the brilliance of colour found in Quattrocento art, Hunt and Millais developed a technique of painting in thin [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]s of pigment over a wet white ground in the hope that the colours would retain jewel-like transparency and clarity. Their emphasis on brilliance of colour was a reaction to the excessive use of [[bitumen]] by earlier British artists, such as Reynolds, [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] and [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]]. Bitumen produces unstable areas of muddy darkness, an effect the Pre-Raphaelites despised.

In 1848, Rossetti and Hunt made a list of "Immortals", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, some of whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings, notably including [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-pre-raphaelites&lt;/ref&gt;

==First exhibitions and publications==
The first exhibitions of Pre-Raphaelite work occurred in 1849. Both Millais's ''[[Isabella (Millais painting)|Isabella]]'' (1848–1849) and Holman Hunt's ''[[Rienzi vowing to obtain justice for the death of his young brother, slain in a skirmish between the Colonna and the Orsini factions|Rienzi]]'' (1848–1849) were exhibited at the Royal Academy.  Rossetti's ''[[:File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 004.jpg|Girlhood of Mary Virgin]]'' was shown at a Free Exhibition on Hyde Park Corner. As agreed, all members of the brotherhood signed their work with their name and the initials "PRB". Between January and April 1850, the group published a literary magazine, ''The Germ'' edited by William Rossetti which published poetry by the Rossettis, Woolner, and Collinson and essays on art and literature by associates of the brotherhood, such as [[Coventry Patmore]]. As the short run-time implies, the magazine did not manage to achieve sustained momentum. (Daly 1989)

==Public controversy==
[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|320px|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'', by John Everett Millais, 1850]]
In 1850, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood became the subject of controversy after the exhibition of Millais' painting ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' was considered to be [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] by many reviewers, notably [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Michael (2009). ''Charles Dickens'', p. 309. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens considered Millais' Mary to be ugly.&lt;ref&gt;Andres, Sophia (2005). ''The Pre-Raphaelite Art of the Victorian Novel: Narrative Challenges to Visual Gendered Boundaries'', p. 9. Ohio State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Millais had used his sister-in-law, Mary Hodgkinson, as the model for Mary in his painting. The brotherhood's  medievalism was attacked as backward-looking and its extreme devotion to detail was condemned as ugly and jarring to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, 3 May 1851; pg. 8; Issue 20792: Exhibition of the Royal Academy. (Private View.), First Notice: ''"We cannot censure at present, as amply or as strongly as we desire to do, that strange disorder of the mind or the eyes which continues to rage with unabated absurdity among a class of juvenile artists who style themselves "P.R.B.," which being interpreted means ''Pre-Raphael Brethren''. Their faith seems to consist in an absolute contempt for perspective and the known laws of light and shade, an aversion to beauty in every shape, and a singular devotion to the minute accidents of their subjects, including, or rather seeking out, every excess of sharpness and deformity."''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dickens, Millais made the Holy Family look like alcoholics and slum-dwellers, adopting contorted and absurd "medieval" poses. A rival group of older artists, [[The Clique]], used its influence against the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and its principles were publicly attacked by the President of the Academy, Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

After the controversy, Collinson left the brotherhood and the remaining members met to discuss whether he should be replaced by Charles Allston Collins or [[Walter Howell Deverell]], but were unable to make a decision. From that point the group disbanded, though its influence continued. Artists who had worked in the style initially continued but no longer signed works "PRB".{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'', by [[John Everett Millais]]]]
The brotherhood found support from the critic [[John Ruskin]], who praised its devotion to nature and rejection of conventional methods of composition. The Pre-Raphaelites were influenced by Ruskin's theories. He wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' defending their work and subsequently met them. Initially, he favoured Millais, who travelled to Scotland in the summer of 1853 with Ruskin and Ruskin's wife, Euphemia Chalmers Ruskin, née Gray (now best known as [[Effie Gray]]). The main object of the journey was to paint Ruskin's portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Dearden, James S. (1999). ''John Ruskin: A Life in Pictures'', pp. 36–37. Sheffield Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Effie became increasingly attached to Millais,&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, pp. 49–94.&lt;/ref&gt; creating a crisis. In subsequent annulment proceedings, Ruskin himself made a statement to his lawyer to the effect that his marriage had been unconsummated.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was annulled on grounds of non-[[consummation]], leaving Effie free to marry Millais,&lt;ref&gt;Dearden (1999), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; but causing a public scandal. Millais began to move away from the Pre-Raphaelite style after his marriage, and Ruskin ultimately attacked his later works. Ruskin continued to support Hunt and Rossetti and provided funds to encourage the art of Rossetti's wife [[Elizabeth Siddall]].

By 1853 the original PRB had virtually dissolved,&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Michael |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of art terms - Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford |isbn=9780199569922}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only Holman Hunt remaining true to its stated aims. But the term "Pre-Raphaelite" stuck to Rossetti and others, including [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], with whom he became involved in [[Oxford]] in 1857.&lt;ref name="Whiteley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whiteley |first=Jon |title=Oxford and the Pre-Raphaelites |year=1989 |publisher=Ashmolean Museum |location=Oxford |isbn=0907849946}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence the term Pre-Raphaelite is associated with the much wider and long-lived art movement, including the dreamy, yearning images of women produced by Rossetti and several of his followers.

==Later developments and influence==
[[File:De Morgan Medea.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Medea]]'' by Evelyn De Morgan, 1889, in [[quattrocento]] style]]
Artists influenced by the brotherhood include [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[Philip Calderon]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Evelyn De Morgan]],&lt;ref name=hilton202&gt;Hilton (1970), pp. 202–05&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Sandys]] (who entered the Pre-Raphaelite circle in 1857)&lt;ref name=hilton202/&gt; and [[John William Waterhouse]]. [[Ford Madox Brown]], who was associated with them from the beginning, is often seen as most closely adopting the Pre-Raphaelite principles. One follower who developed his own distinct style was [[Aubrey Beardsley]], who was pre-eminently influenced by Burne-Jones.&lt;ref name=hilton202/&gt;

After 1856, Dante Gabriel Rossetti became an inspiration for the medievalising strand of the movement. He was the link between the two types of Pre-Raphaelite painting (nature and Romance) after the PRB became lost in the later decades of the century. Rossetti, although the least committed to the brotherhood, continued the name and changed its style. He began painting versions of femme fatales using models like [[Jane Morris]], in paintings such as ''Proserpine'', ''The Blue Silk Dress'', and ''La Pia de' Tolomei''. His work influenced his friend [[William Morris]], in whose firm [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co.]] he became a partner, and with whose wife Jane he may have had an affair. Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones also became partners in the firm. Through Morris's company, the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood influenced many interior designers and architects, arousing interest in [[medieval]] designs and other crafts leading to the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] headed by William Morris. Holman Hunt was involved with the movement to reform design through the [[Della Robbia Pottery]] company.

After 1850, Hunt and Millais moved away from direct imitation of medieval art. They stressed the realist and scientific aspects of the movement, though Hunt continued to emphasise the spiritual significance of art, seeking to reconcile religion and science by making accurate observations and studies of locations in [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] for his paintings on biblical subjects. In contrast, Millais abandoned Pre-Raphaelitism after 1860, adopting a much broader and looser style influenced by Reynolds. William Morris and others condemned his reversal of principles.

[[File:The Death of King Arthur by James Archer (1860).jpg|thumb|left|James Archer, ''The Death of King Arthur'', 1860]]
Pre-Raphaelitism had a significant impact in Scotland and on Scottish artists. The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460-1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860), which contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821-1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of Millais and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855). His later paintings, like those of Millais, have been criticised for descending into popular sentimentality.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460-1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millais was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823-1904) and whose work includes ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Barber, ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief'' (Harvard University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0674013905}}, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Raphaelism also inspired painters like [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fineartbookstore.com/s-120-Pre-Raphaelites|title=Fine Art Books Art Instruction {{!}} Photography Books {{!}} Visual Arts Periods, Groups &amp; Movements: Pre-Raphaelites|last=|first=|date=|website=fineartbookstore.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement influenced many later British artists into the 20th century. Rossetti came to be seen as a precursor of the wider European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement. In the late 20th century the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]] based its aims on Pre-Raphaelitism, while the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] and the [[Birmingham Group (artists)|Birmingham Group]] have also derived inspiration from it.

[[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] has a world-renowned collection of works by Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites that, some claim, strongly influenced the young [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Bucher (2004) for a brief discussion on the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites on Tolkien.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', with influences taken from the same mythological scenes portrayed by the Pre-Raphaelites.
[[File:Arthur Hughes - Fair Rosamund - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|[[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], ''Fair Rosamund'', 1854]]
In the 20th century artistic ideals changed, and art moved away from representing reality. Since the Pre-Raphaelites were fixed on portraying things with near-photographic precision, though with a distinctive attention to detailed surface-patterns, their work was devalued by many painters and critics. After the [[First World War]], British [[Modernism|Modernists]] associated Pre-Raphaelite art with the repressive and backward times in which they grew up. In the 1960s there was a major revival of Pre-Raphaelitism. Exhibitions and catalogues of works, culminating in a 1984 exhibition in London's [[Tate Gallery]], re-established a canon of Pre-Raphaelite work.&lt;ref&gt;Barringer, Tim (1999). ''Reading the Pre-Raphaelites'', p. 17. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Among many other exhibitions, there was another large show at [[Tate Britain]] in 2012–13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde ''Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde''], Tate Britain, accessed 27 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustration and poetry==
Many members of the ‘inner’ Pre-Raphaelite circle ([[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]]) and ‘outer’ circle ([[Frederick Sandys]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Simeon Solomon]], [[Henry Hugh Armstead]], [[Joseph Noel Paton]], [[Frederic Shields]], [[Matthew James Lawless]]) were working concurrently in painting, illustration, and sometimes poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Illustration: The Pre-Raphaelites, the Idyllic School and the High Victorians|last=Goldman|first=Paul|publisher=Lund Humphries|year=2004|isbn=|location=Burlington, VT|pages=1–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian morality judged literature as superior to painting, because of its “noble grounds for noble emotion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Williams Buchanan|Robert Buchanan]] (a writer and opponent of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) felt so strongly about this artistic hierarchy that he wrote: “The truth is that literature, and more particularly poetry, is in a very bad way when one art gets hold of another, and imposes upon it its conditions and limitations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Robert W.|date=October 1871|title=The Fleshly School of Poetry: Mr. D.G. Rossetti|url=|journal=The Contemporary Review|volume=|pages=|via=}} as cited in Welland, D.S.R. The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art. London, UK: George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd., 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the hostile environment in which Pre-Raphaelites were defiantly working in various media. The Pre-Raphaelites attempted to revitalize [[subject painting]], which had been dismissed as artificial. Their belief that each picture should tell a story was an important step for the unification of painting and literature (eventually deemed the [[Sister Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/1.1.html|title=Chapter One: Ruskin's Theories of the Sister Arts — Ut Pictura Poesis|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or at least a break in the rigid hierarchy promoted by writers like Robert Buchanan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letter from D.G. Rossetti to William Allingham|last=Rossetti|first=Dante Gabriel|work=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|publisher=|year=1855|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pre-Raphaelite desire for more extensive affiliation between painting and literature also manifested in illustration. Illustration is a more direct unification of these media and, like subject painting, can assert a narrative of its own. For the Pre-Raphaelites, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti specifically, there was anxiety about the constraints of illustration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1855, Rossetti wrote to [[William Allingham]] about the independence of illustration: “I have not begun even designing for them yet, but fancy I shall try the ‘Vision of Sin’ and ‘Palace of Art’ etc. – those where one can allegorize on one’s own hook, without killing for oneself and everyone a distinct idea of the poet’s."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This passage makes apparent Rossetti’s desire to not just support the poet’s narrative, but to create an allegorical illustration that functions separately from the text as well. In this respect, Pre-Raphaelite illustrations go beyond depicting an episode from a poem, but rather function like subject paintings within a text.

==Collections==
[[File:William Holman Hunt 001.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''[[The Hireling Shepherd]]'', 1851]]
There are major collections of Pre-Raphaelite work in United Kingdom museums such as the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], the [[Tate Gallery]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Manchester Art Gallery]], [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]], and Liverpool's [[Walker Art Gallery]]. The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] and the [[Delaware Art Museum]] in the US have the most significant collections of Pre-Raphaelite art outside the UK. The [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]] in Puerto Rico also has a notable collection of Pre-Raphaelite works, including Sir Edward Burne-Jones' ''[[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon]]'', [[Frederic Lord Leighton]]'s ''[[Flaming June]]'', and works by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and [[Frederic Sandys]].

There is a set of Pre-Raphaelite murals in the Old Library at the [[Oxford Union]], depicting scenes from the [[Arthurian legend]]s, painted between 1857 and 1859 by a team of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris, and Edward Burne-Jones.  The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] houses at [[Wightwick Manor]], [[Wolverhampton]], and at [[Wallington Hall]], [[Northumberland]], both have significant and representative collections. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] is an avid collector of Pre-Raphaelite works, and a selection of 300 items from his collection were shown at an exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 2003.

[[Kelmscott Manor]], the country home of [[William Morris]] from 1871 until his death in 1896, is owned by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] and is open to the public. The Manor is featured in Morris' work ''[[News from Nowhere]]''. It also appears in the background of [[Water Willow (Rossetti)|''Water Willow'']], a portrait of his wife, [[Jane Morris]], painted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] in 1871.  There are exhibitions connected with Morris and Rossetti’s early experiments with photography.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
The story of the brotherhood, from its controversial first exhibition to being embraced by the art establishment, has been depicted in two [[BBC]] television series. The first, ''[[The Love School]]'', was broadcast in 1975; the second is the 2009 BBC television drama serial ''[[Desperate Romantics]]'' by [[Peter Bowker]]. Although much of the latter's material is derived from [[Franny Moyle]]'s factual book ''Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/25/romantics.shtml Desperate Romantics press pack: introduction] ''BBC Press Office''. Retrieved on 24 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the series occasionally departs from established facts in favour of dramatic licence and is prefaced by the disclaimer: "In the mid-19th century, a group of young men challenged the art establishment of the day. The pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were inspired by the real world around them, yet took imaginative licence in their art. This story, based on their lives and loves, follows in that inventive spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC2 drama on icons among Pre-Raphaelites |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6626470.ece|author=Armstrong, Stephen|work=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken Russell]]'s television film ''[[Dante's Inferno (1967 TV film)|Dante's Inferno]]'' (1967) contains brief scenes on some of the leading Pre-Raphaelites but mainly concentrates on the life of Rossetti, played by [[Oliver Reed]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14363">In [[phonetics]], '''preaspiration''' (sometimes spelled '''pre-aspiration''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nance|Stuart-Smith|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a period of [[Voice (phonetics)|voicelessness]] or [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] preceding the closure of a voiceless [[obstruent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Silverman|2003|p=575}}&lt;/ref&gt; basically equivalent to an {{IPA|[h]}}-like sound preceding the obstruent. In other words, when an obstruent is preaspirated, the [[glottis]] is opened for some time before the obstruent closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Stevens|Hajek|2004|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; To mark preaspiration using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], the diacritic for regular aspiration, {{angbr|{{IPA|ʰ}}}}, can be placed before the preaspirated consonant. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}{{page missing|date=August 2018}} prefer to use a simple cluster notation, e.g. {{angbr|{{IPA|hk}}}} instead of {{angbr|{{IPA|ʰk}}}}.

==Typology==
Preaspiration is comparatively uncommon across languages of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Silverman|2003|p=592}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is claimed by some to not be [[Phoneme|phonemically]] [[Minimal pair|contrastive]] in any language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Tronnier|2002|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}} note that, at least in the case of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], preaspirated stops have a longer duration of aspiration than normally aspirated (post-aspirated) stops, comparable to clusters of {{IPA|[h]}}+consonant in languages with such clusters.  As a result, they view preaspiration as purely a distributional feature, indistinguishable phonetically and phonologically from clusters with {{IPA|/h/}}, and prefer to notate preaspirated stops as clusters, e.g. Icelandic ''kappi'' {{IPA|/ˈkʰahpi/}} "hero" rather than {{IPA|/ˈkʰaʰpi/}}.

A distinction is often made between so-called ''normative'' and ''non-normative'' preaspiration: in a language with normative preaspiration of certain voiceless obstruents, the preaspiration is obligatory even though it is not a distinctive feature; in a language with non-normative preaspiration, the preaspiration can be phonetically structured for those who use it, but it is non-obligatory, and may not appear with all speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gordeeva|Scobbie|2007|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|McRobbie-Utasi|2003|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preaspirated consonants are typically in free variation with [[spirant]]-stop clusters, though they may also have a relationship (synchronically and diachronically) with long vowels or {{IPA|[s]}}-stop clusters.&lt;ref name="Silverman"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Silverman|2003|p=593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preaspiration can take a number of different forms; while the most usual is [[Glottal consonant|glottal]] [[Fricative consonant|friction]] (an {{IPA|[h]}}-like sound), the precise phonetic quality can be affected by the obstruent or the preceding vowel, becoming for example {{IPA|[ç]}} after [[close vowel]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Stevens|Hajek|2004|pp=334–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; other potential realizations include {{IPA|[x]}}&lt;ref name="Silverman" /&gt; and even {{IPA|[f]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|McRobbie-Utasi|1991|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preaspiration is very unstable both synchronically and diachronically and is often replaced by a fricative or by a lengthening of the preceding vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Silverman|2003|pp=592, 595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Preaspiration is perhaps best known from [[North Germanic languages]], most prominently in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]], but also some dialects of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. It is also a prominent feature of [[Scottish Gaelic phonology#Preaspiration|Scottish Gaelic]]. The presence of preaspiration in Gaelic has been attributed to Scandinavian influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nordic Languages |author=Oskar Bandle, Gun Widmark |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6b7WwBC5tRAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=scottish+gaelic+%22vowel+breaking%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Mxv4T5iQPMmz8QO33MSGBw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=scottish%20gaelic&amp;f=false |page=2059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Northwestern Europe preaspiration is furthermore found in most [[Sami languages]]. Preaspiration is absent from [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]], where it has been replaced by postaspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sammallahti|1998|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical relationship between preaspiration in Sami and Scandinavian is disputed: there is general agreement of a connection, but not on whether it represents Sami influence in Scandinavian, or Scandinavian influence in Sami.

Elsewhere in the world, preaspiration occurs in [[Mongolian language|Halh Mongolian]] and in several [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|American Indian languages]], including dialects of [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], [[Fox language|Fox]], [[Miami-Illinois]],  [[Hopi language|Hopi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rießler|2004|p=?}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|McRobbie-Utasi|1991|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|McRobbie-Utasi|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Svantesson|2003|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[P'urhépecha language|Purepecha]].

==Examples==

===English===
In certain accents, such as [[Geordie]] (among younger women)&lt;ref name="wa268"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watt|Allen|2003|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some speakers of [[Hiberno-English|Dublin English]]&lt;ref name="unidue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=https://www.uni-due.de/vcde/VCDE_Glossary.htm#GlossE|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; word- and utterance-final {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} can be preaspirated.

===Faroese===
Some examples of preaspirated [[Plosive consonant|plosive]]s and [[Affricate consonant|affricate]]s from [[Faroese language|Faroese]] (where they occur only after stressed vowels):

* {{lang|fo|klappa}} {{IPA-fo|ˈkʰlaʰpːa|}}, 'clap'
* ''hattur'' {{IPA-fo|ˈhaʰtːʊɹ|}}, 'hat'
* ''takka'' {{IPA-fo|ˈtʰaʰkːa|}}, 'thank'
* ''søkkja'' {{IPA-fo|ˈsœʰt͡ʃːa|}}, 'sink' (transitive)

Furthermore, the dialects of [[Vágar]], northern [[Streymoy]] and [[Eysturoy]] also have ungeminated preaspirated plosives and affricates (except after close vowels/diphthongs):

* ''apa'' {{IPA-fo|ˈɛaːʰpa|}}, 'ape', but: ''vípa'' {{IPA-fo|ˈvʊiːpa|}}, '[[northern lapwing]]'
* ''eta'' {{IPA-fo|ˈeːʰta|}}, 'eat', but: ''hiti'' {{IPA-fo|ˈhiːtɪ|}}, 'heat'
* ''vøka'' {{IPA-fo|ˈvøːʰka|}}, 'wake', but: ''húka'' {{IPA-fo|ˈhʉuːka|}}, to 'squat'
* ''høkja'' {{IPA-fo|ˈhøːʰt͡ʃa|}}, 'crutch', but: ''vitja'' {{IPA-fo|ˈviːt͡ʃa|}}, to 'visit'

===Icelandic===
Some examples of preaspirated [[Plosive consonant|plosive]]s from [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (where they occur only after stressed vowels):&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Silverman|2003|p=582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''kappi'' {{IPA-is|ˈkʰaʰpi|}}, 'hero'
*''hattur'' {{IPA-is|ˈhaʰtʏr|}}, 'hat'
*''þakka'' {{IPA-is|ˈθaʰka||is-þakka.ogg}}, 'thank'

===Huautla Mazatec===
In [[Mazatecan languages|Huautla Mazatec]], preaspirates can occur word-initially, perhaps uniquely among languages which contain preaspirates:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Silverman|2003|pp=590–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{IPA-xx|ʰti|}} - 'fish'
*{{IPA-xx|ʰtse|}} - 'a sore'
*{{IPA-xx|ʰtʃi|}} - 'small'
*{{IPA-xx|ʰka|}} - 'stubble'

=== Sami languages===
Preaspiration in the Sami languages occurs on word-medial voiceless stops and affricates of all [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]] available: {{IPA|/p/, /t̪/, /t͡s/, /t͡ɕ/, /k/}}. In the Western Sami languages ([[Southern Sami language|Southern]], [[Ume Sami|Ume]], [[Pite Sami language|Pite]], [[Lule Sami language|Lule]] and [[Northern Sami language|Northern]]) as well as [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], preaspiration affects both long and half-long consonants; in most Eastern Sami languages ([[Akkala Sami language|Akkala]], [[Kildin Sami language|Kildin]] and [[Ter Sami language|Ter]]) only fully long consonants are preaspirated. This likely represents two waves of innovation: an early preaspiration of long consonants dating back to [[Proto-Sami language|Proto-Sami]], followed by a secondary preaspiration of half-long consonants that originated in the Western Sami area and spread eastwards to Skolt Sami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sammallahti|1998|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Sami languages, preaspirated stops/affricates contrast with lax voiceless stops, either due to denasalization of earlier clusters (e.g. *nt &gt; {{IPA|[d̥ː]}}) or in connection to [[consonant gradation]].

===Scottish Gaelic===
In Scottish Gaelic, however, due to the historical loss of voiced stops preaspiration is phonemic in medial and final positions after stressed vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Borgstrøm, C. ''The Dialects of the Outer Hebrides'' (1940) Norsk Tidskrift for Sprogvidenskap&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gaelic preaspiration.jpg|thumb|The approximate distribution of preaspiration in Gaelic dialects]]
Its strength varies from area to area and can manifest itself as {{IPA|[ʰ]}} or {{IPA|[h]}} or in areas with strong preaspiration as {{IPA|[ç]}} or {{IPA|[x]}}. The occurrence of preaspiration follows a hierarchy of c &gt; t &gt; p; i.e. if a dialect has preaspiration with p, it will also have it in the other places of articulation. Preaspiration manifests itself as follows:&lt;ref name=Survey&gt;Ó Dochartaigh, C. ''Survey of the Gaelic Dialects of Scotland I-V'' Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (1997) {{ISBN|1-85500-165-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==h-clusters==
Although distinguishing preaspirated consonants from clusters of /{{IPAlink|h}}/ and a voiceless consonant can be difficult, the reverse does not hold: there are numerous languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Finnish language|Finnish]] where such clusters are unanimously considered to constitute consonant clusters.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In [[religion]] and [[ethics]], the '''inviolability''' or '''sanctity of life''' is a principle of implied protection regarding aspects of [[sentience|sentient]] life that are said to be holy, [[sacred]], or otherwise of such [[Value theory|value]] that they are not to be violated. This can be applied to both animals and humans, for instance in religions that practice [[Ahimsa]], as both are seen as holy and worthy of life.

The concept of inviolability is an important tie between the ethics of religion and the ethics of law, as each seeks justification for its principles as based on both purity and natural concept, as well as in universality of application.

==In Christianity==
{{Main article|Christianity and abortion}}
The phrase ''sanctity of life'' refers to the idea that human life is [[sacred]], [[holy]], and precious, argued mainly by the [[pro-life]] side in political and [[Morality|moral]] debates over such controversial issues as [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[euthanasia]], [[embryonic stem-cell research]], and the "[[right to die]]" in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]] and other [[English-speaking countries]]. (Comparable phrases are also used in other languages.) Although the phrase was used primarily in the 19th century in [[Protestant]] discourse, after [[World War II]] the phrase has been used in [[Catholic moral theology]] and, following ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] moral rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Drutchas, Geoffrey Gilbert|title=Is Life Sacred? The Incoherence of the Sanctity of Life as a Moral Principle within the Christian Churches|publisher=Lancaster Theological Seminary|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sanctity of life principle, which is often contrasted with the "[[Quality of Life (Healthcare)|quality of life]]" to some extent, is the basis of all [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] teaching about the fifth commandment in the [[Ten Commandments in Catholic theology|Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzIMeFZZuycC |title=Jewish and Catholic Bioethics: An Ecumenical Dialogue |editor1=[[Edmund Pellegrino|Edmund D.

== In Eastern religions ==
In Western thought, sanctity of life is usually applied solely to the human species ([[anthropocentrism]], sometimes called [[dominionism]]), in marked contrast to many schools of [[Eastern philosophy]], which often hold that all animal life is sacred―in some cases to such a degree that, for example, practitioners of [[Jainism]] carry brushes with which to sweep insects from their path, lest they inadvertently tread upon them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/5greatvows.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Carlin]], American social critic and author, challenged this viewpoint in his 1996 album and HBO special ''[[Back in Town (George Carlin album)|Back in Town]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lybio.net/george-carlin-pro-life-abortion-and-the-sanctity-of-life/comedy/|title=George Carlin: Pro Life, Abortion, And The Sanctity Of Life|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Schiehallion experiment''' was an 18th-century [[experiment]] to determine the [[Arithmetic mean|mean]] [[density]] of the [[Earth]]. Funded by a grant from the [[Royal Society]], it was conducted in the summer of 1774 around the Scottish [[Mountains and hills of Scotland|mountain]] of [[Schiehallion]], [[Perthshire]]. The experiment involved measuring the tiny deflection of a [[pendulum]] due to the [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] of a nearby mountain. Schiehallion was considered the ideal location after a search for candidate mountains, thanks to its isolation and almost symmetrical shape. One of the triggers for the experiment were [[Mason–Dixon line#Systematic errors and experiments to weigh the Earth|anomalies]] noted during the survey of the [[Mason–Dixon line]].{{citation needed lead|date=February 2017}}

[[File:Schiehallion 01.jpg|right|thumb|240px|alt=We look across green fields to a mountain rising behind a line of trees. Its flanks are bare, and the mountain shows a distinctly symmetrical peak.|Schiehallion's isolated position and symmetrical shape lent well to the experiment]]

The experiment had previously been considered, but rejected, by [[Isaac Newton]] as a practical demonstration of his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|theory of gravitation]]. However, a team of scientists, notably [[Nevil Maskelyne]], the [[Astronomer Royal]], was convinced that the effect would be detectable and undertook to conduct the experiment. The deflection angle depended on the relative densities and volumes of the Earth and the mountain: if the density and volume of Schiehallion could be ascertained, then so could the density of the Earth. Once this was known, then this would in turn yield approximate values for those of the other planets, their [[natural satellites|moons]], and the [[Sun]], previously known only in terms of their relative ratios. As an additional benefit, the concept of [[contour line]]s, devised to simplify the process of surveying the mountain, later became a standard technique in [[cartography]].

==Background==
A [[pendulum]] hangs straight downwards in a symmetrical [[gravitational field]]. However, if a sufficiently large mass such as a mountain is nearby, its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's [[plumb-bob]] slightly out of true (in the sense that it doesn't point to the centre of mass of the Earth).  The change in plumb-line angle against a known object&amp;mdash;such as a star&amp;mdash;could be carefully measured on opposite sides of the mountain. If the mass of the mountain could be independently established from a determination of its [[volume]] and an estimate of the mean [[density]] of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, [[Earth mass|its mass]].

[[Isaac Newton]] had considered the effect in the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'',&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=R.D.|title=A Commemoration of Maskelyne at Schiehallion|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=26|issue=3|pages=289–294|bibcode=1985QJRAS..26..289D|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; but pessimistically thought that any real mountain would produce too small a deflection to measure.&lt;ref name=Principia&gt;{{Cite book|last=Newton|title=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica |volume=II |page=528 |url=http://scanserver.ulib.org/is/scanserver/newton/xml/doc.scn?pg=527&amp;rp=_n|isbn=0-521-07647-1}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}} Translated: Andrew Motte, First American Edition. New York, 1846&lt;/ref&gt; Gravitational effects, he wrote, were only discernible on the planetary scale.&lt;ref name=Principia/&gt; Newton's pessimism was unfounded: although his calculations had suggested a deviation of less than 2&amp;nbsp;[[minute of arc|minutes of arc]] (for an idealised three-mile high mountain), this angle, though very slight, was within the theoretical capability of instruments of his day.&lt;ref name="Sillitto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sillittopages.co.uk/schie/schie90.html|title=Maskelyne on Schiehallion: A Lecture to The Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow |last=Sillitto|first=R.M.|date=31 October 1990 |accessdate=28 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment to test Newton's idea would both provide supporting evidence for his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], and estimates of the mass and density of the Earth. Since the masses of astronomical objects were known only in terms of relative ratios, the mass of the Earth would provide reasonable values to the other [[planet]]s, their [[Natural satellite|moons]], and the [[Sun]]. The data were also capable of determining the value of [[Gravitational constant|Newton's gravitational constant]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|G}}, though this was not a goal of the experimenters; references to a value for {{mvar|G}} would not appear in the scientific literature until almost a hundred years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cornu|first=A.|author2=Baille, J.

===Chimborazo, 1738===
A pair of French astronomers named [[Pierre Bouguer]] and [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] were the first to attempt the experiment, conducting their measurements on the {{convert|6268|m|ft|adj=on}} volcano [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]]&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;At the time, part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Contemporary sources therefore refer to the 'Peruvian Expedition'.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1738.&lt;ref name="Poynting_p50-56"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Poynting|first=J.H.|title=The Earth: its shape, size, weight and spin|publisher=Cambridge|date=1913 |pages=50–56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their expedition had left France for South America in 1735 to try to measure the [[meridian arc]] length of one degree of latitude near the [[equator]], but they took advantage of the opportunity to attempt the deflection experiment. In December 1738, under very difficult conditions of terrain and climate, they conducted a pair of measurements at altitudes of 4,680 and 4,340&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name="Poynting_1894"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Poynting|first=J.

That a further attempt should be made on the experiment was proposed to the [[Royal Society]] in 1772 by [[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Astronomer Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maskelyne|first=N.|date=1772|title=A proposal for measuring the attraction of some hill in this Kingdom |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=65|pages=495–499 |bibcode=1775RSPT...65..495M|doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the experiment would "do honour to the nation where it was made"&lt;ref name="Sillitto"/&gt; and proposed [[Whernside]] in [[Yorkshire]], or the [[Blencathra]]-[[Skiddaw]] massif in [[Cumberland]] as suitable targets. The Royal Society formed the Committee of Attraction to consider the matter, appointing Maskelyne, [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] amongst its members.&lt;ref name="Danson_p115"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Danson|first=Edwin |title=Weighing the World |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|pages=115–116|isbn=978-0-19-518169-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNH_Y7ERFeoC&amp;pg=PA146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee despatched the astronomer and surveyor [[Charles Mason]]&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Mason, together with [[Jeremiah Dixon]], had earlier marked the Mason–Dixon line which separated the northern and southern United States.&lt;/ref&gt; to find a suitable mountain.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;

After a lengthy search over the summer of 1773, Mason reported that the best candidate was [[Schiehallion]] (then spelled ''Schehallien''), a {{convert|1083|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} peak lying between [[Loch Tay]] and [[Loch Rannoch]] in the central [[Scottish Highlands]].&lt;ref name="Danson_p115" /&gt; The mountain stood in isolation from any nearby hills, which would reduce their gravitational influence, and its symmetrical east–west ridge would simplify the calculations. Its steep northern and southern slopes would allow the experiment to be sited close to its [[centre of mass]], maximising the deflection effect. Coincidentally, the summit lies almost exactly at the latitudinal and longitudinal centre of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hewitt|first=Rachel |date=2010 |title= Map of a Nation: A Biography Of The Ordnance Survey|url= |location= |publisher=Granta Books |page= |isbn= 9781847084521|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mason however declined to conduct the work himself for the offered commission of one [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] per day.&lt;ref name="Danson_p115" /&gt; The task therefore fell to Maskelyne, for which he was granted a temporary leave of his duties as Astronomer Royal. He was aided in the task by mathematician and surveyor [[Charles Hutton]] and [[Reuben Burrow]], a mathematician of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. A workforce of labourers was engaged to construct observatories for the astronomers, and assist in the surveying. The science team was particularly well-equipped: its astronomical instruments included a {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on|adj=on}} brass [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] from [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's 1769 transit of Venus expedition]], a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[zenith sector]], and a regulator (precision [[pendulum clock]]) for timing the astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="Danson_p146"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Danson|first=Edwin |title=Weighing the World |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|page=146|isbn=978-0-19-518169-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNH_Y7ERFeoC&amp;pg=PA146}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also acquired a [[theodolite]] and [[Gunter's chain]] for surveying the mountain, and a pair of [[barometer]]s for measuring altitude.&lt;ref name="Danson_p146" /&gt; Generous funding for the experiment was available due to underspend on the [[transit of Venus]] expedition, which had been turned over to the Society by the [[George III of the United Kingdom|King]].&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sillitto" /&gt;

==Measurements==

===Astronomical===
[[File:Schiehallion angles.svg|right|300px|alt=A diagram shows a pendulum attracted slightly towards a mountain. A small angle is created between the true vertical indicated by a star and the plumb line.|thumb|The deflection is the difference between the true [[zenith]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|Z}} as determined by [[astrometry]], and the apparent zenith {{mvar|Z&amp;prime;}} as determined by a [[plumb-line]]]]
Observatories were constructed to the north and south of the mountain, plus a [[bothy]] to accommodate equipment and the scientists.&lt;ref name="Poynting_1894"/&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;These constructions are now ruined, but their remnants may still be found on the mountainside.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the workforce was however housed in rough canvas tents. Maskelyne's astronomical measurements were the first to be conducted. It was necessary for him to determine the [[zenith distance]]s with respect to the plumb line for a set of stars at the precise time that each passed due south.&lt;ref name="Sillitto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="countingthoughts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countingthoughts.com/ct/wtw/notes.pdf|title=The "Weigh the World" Challenge 2005|date=23 April 2005|publisher=countingthoughts|accessdate=28 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poynting_p56-59"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Poynting|first=J.H.|title=The Earth: its shape, size, weight and spin|publisher=Cambridge|date=1913|pages=56–59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather conditions were frequently unfavourable due to mist and rain. However, from the south observatory, he was able to take 76 measurements on 34 stars in one direction, and then 93 observations on 39 stars in the other. From the north side, he then conducted a set of 68 observations on 32 stars and a set of 100 on 37 stars.&lt;ref name="Poynting_1894" /&gt; By conducting sets of measurements with the plane of the zenith sector first facing east and then west, he successfully avoided any systematic errors arising from [[collimation|collimating]] the sector.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;

To determine the deflection due to the mountain, it was necessary to account for the curvature of the Earth: an observer moving north or south will see the local [[zenith]] shift by the same angle as any change in [[latitude]]. After accounting for observational effects such as [[precession]], [[aberration of light]] and  [[nutation]], Maskelyne showed that the difference between the locally determined zenith for observers north and south of Schiehallion was 54.6&amp;nbsp;arc seconds.&lt;ref name="Poynting_1894" /&gt; Once the surveying team had provided a difference of 42.94″ latitude between the two stations, he was able to subtract this, and after rounding to the accuracy of his observations, announce that the sum of the north and south deflections was 11.6″.&lt;ref name="Sillitto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poynting_1894"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maskelyne_results"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maskelyne |first=N.|date=1775|title=An Account of Observations Made on the Mountain Schiehallion for Finding Its Attraction|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=65|issue=0|pages=500–542|doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maskelyne published his initial results in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' in 1775,&lt;ref name="Maskelyne_results" /&gt; using preliminary data on the mountain's shape and hence the position of its [[center of mass|center of gravity]]. This led him to expect a deflection of 20.9″ if the mean densities of Schiehallion and the Earth were equal.&lt;ref name="Sillitto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="text-book"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Poynting|first=J. H.|author2=Thomson, J. J.  | title=A text-book of physics | pages=33–35| date=1909 |url=https://archive.org/download/textbookofphysic01poynuoft/textbookofphysic01poynuoft.pdf|isbn=1-4067-7316-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the deflection was about half this, he was able to make a preliminary announcement that the mean density of the Earth was approximately double that of Schiehallion.  A more accurate value would have to await completion of the surveying process.&lt;ref name="Maskelyne_results" /&gt;

Maskelyne took the opportunity to note that Schiehallion exhibited a gravitational attraction, and thus all mountains did; and that Newton's inverse square law of gravitation had been confirmed.&lt;ref name="Maskelyne_results" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mackenzie|first=A.S.|title=The laws of gravitation; memoirs by Newton, Bouguer and Cavendish, together with abstracts of other important memoirs|date=1900|pages=53–56|url=https://archive.org/download/lawsofgravitatio00mackrich/lawsofgravitatio00mackrich.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appreciative Royal Society presented Maskelyne with the 1775 [[Copley Medal]]; the biographer [[Alexander Chalmers|Chalmers]] later noting that "If any doubts yet remained with respect to the truth of the Newtonian system, they were now totally removed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chalmers|first=A.|title=The General Biographical Dictionary|date=1816|volume=25|page=317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uh8IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveying===
The work of the surveying team was greatly hampered by the inclemency of the weather, and it took until 1776 to complete the task.&lt;ref name="text-book"/&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;During a drunken party to celebrate the end of the surveying, the northern observatory was accidentally burned to the ground, taking with it a fiddle belonging to Duncan Robertson, a junior member of the surveying team. In gratitude for the entertainment Robertson's playing had provided Maskelyne during the four months of astronomical observations, he compensated him by replacing the lost violin with a [[Stradivarius]].&lt;/ref&gt; To find the volume of the mountain, it was necessary to divide it into a set of vertical [[prism (geometry)|prism]]s and compute the volume of each. The [[triangulation]] task falling to Charles Hutton was considerable: the surveyors had obtained thousands of bearings to more than a thousand points around the mountain.&lt;ref name="Danson_p153-154"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Danson|first=Edwin |title=Weighing the World |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|pages=153–154|isbn=978-0-19-518169-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNH_Y7ERFeoC&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the vertices of his prisms did not always conveniently coincide with the surveyed heights. To make sense of all his data, he hit upon the idea of [[interpolation|interpolating]] a series of lines at set intervals between his measure values, marking points of equal height. In doing so, not only could he easily determine the heights of his prisms, but from the swirl of the lines one could get an instant impression of the form of the terrain. Hutton had invented [[contour line]]s, in common use since for [[Cartographic relief depiction|depicting cartographic relief]].&lt;ref name="Poynting_1894"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danson_p153-154"/&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;This was arguably a rediscovery: [[Edmond Halley]] had plotted lines of equal magnetic variation ([[isogon]]s) in 1701, and [[Nicholas Cruquius]] lines of equal depth ([[isobath]]s) in 1727.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton had to compute the individual attractions due to each of the many prisms that formed his grid, a process which was as laborious as the survey itself. The task occupied his time for a further two years before he could present his results, which he did in a hundred-page paper to the Royal Society in 1778.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutton|first=C. |date=1778 |title=An Account of the Calculations Made from the Survey and Measures Taken at Schehallien |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=68 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1778.0034|issue=0 |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/68/689.citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the attraction of the plumb-bob to the Earth would be 9,933 times that of the sum of its attractions to the mountain at the north and south stations, if the density of the Earth and Schiehallion had been the same.&lt;ref name="Danson_p153-154"/&gt; Since the actual deflection of 11.6″ implied a ratio of 17,804:1 after accounting for the [[Earth's gravity#Latitude|effect of latitude on gravity]], he was able to state that the Earth had a mean density of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{17,804}{9,933}&lt;/math&gt;, or about &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{9}{5}&lt;/math&gt; that of the mountain.&lt;ref name="text-book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danson_p153-154"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton"/&gt; The lengthy process of surveying the mountain had not therefore greatly affected the outcome of Maskelyne's calculations. Hutton took a density of {{nowrap|2,500 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} for Schiehallion, and announced that the density of the Earth was &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{9}{5}&lt;/math&gt; of this, or {{nowrap|4,500 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Danson_p153-154"/&gt; In comparison with the modern accepted figure of {{nowrap|5,515 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}},&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt; the density of the Earth had been computed with an error of less than 20%.

That the mean density of the Earth should so greatly exceed that of its surface rocks naturally meant that there must be more dense material lying deeper. Hutton correctly surmised that the core material was likely metallic, and might have a density of {{nowrap|10,000 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Danson_p153-154"/&gt; He estimated this metallic portion to occupy some 65% of the diameter of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Hutton"/&gt; With a value for the mean density of the Earth, Hutton was able to set some values to [[Jérôme Lalande]]'s planetary tables, which had previously only been able to express the densities of the major solar system objects in relative terms.&lt;ref name="Hutton" /&gt;

==Repeat experiments==
{{Main|Cavendish experiment}}
A more accurate measurement of the mean density of the Earth was made 24 years after Schiehallion, when in 1798 [[Henry Cavendish]] used an exquisitely sensitive [[torsion balance]] to measure the attraction between large masses of [[lead]]. Cavendish's figure of {{nowrap|5,448 ± 33  kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} was only 1.2% from the currently accepted value of {{nowrap|5,515 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and his result would not be significantly improved upon until 1895 by [[C. V. Boys|Charles Boys]].&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;A value of {{math|5,480 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} appears in Cavendish's paper. He had however made an arithmetical error: his measurements actually led to a value of {{math|5,448 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}; a discrepancy that was not found until 1821 by [[Francis Baily]].&lt;/ref&gt; The care with which Cavendish conducted the experiment and the accuracy of his result has led his name to since be associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McCormmach | first = Russell |author2=Jungnickel, Christa  | title = Cavendish | publisher = [[American Philosophical Society]] | date = 1996 | pages = 340–341 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUoLAAAAIAAJ | isbn = 978-0-87169-220-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Playfair]] carried out a second survey of Schiehallion in 1811; on the basis of a rethink of its rock strata, he suggested a density of 4,560 to {{nowrap|4,870 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}},&lt;ref name="Ranalli"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ranalli|first=G.|date=1984|title=An Early Geophysical Estimate of the Mean Density of the Earth: Schehallien, 1774 |journal=Earth Sciences History|volume=3|issue=2|pages=149–152|url=http://hess.metapress.com/content/k43q522gtt440172/}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the then elderly Hutton vigorously defended the original value in an 1821 paper to the Society.&lt;ref name="Sillitto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutton|first=Charles|date=1821|title=On the mean density of the earth|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|url=https://archive.org/details/onmeandensityofe00huttiala}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playfair's calculations had raised the density closer towards its modern value, but was still too low and significantly poorer than [[Henry Cavendish|Cavendish]]'s computation of some years earlier.

[[File:Edinburgh Arthur Seat dsc06165.jpg|thumb|left|240px|alt=An irregular grass-covered mountain near sunset.|[[Arthur's Seat]], the site of Henry James's 1856 experiment]]
The Schiehallion experiment was repeated in 1856 by [[Henry James (Ordnance Survey)|Henry James]], director-general of the [[Ordnance Survey]], who instead used the hill [[Arthur's Seat]] in central [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="Poynting_1894" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poynting_p56-59"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=James|date=1856|title=On the Deflection of the Plumb-Line at Arthur's Seat, and the Mean Specific Gravity of the Earth|pages=591–606|volume=146|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|jstor=108603|doi=10.1098/rstl.1856.0029}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the resources of the Ordnance Survey at his disposal, James extended his topographical survey to a 21-kilometre radius, taking him as far as the borders of [[Midlothian]]. He obtained a density of about {{nowrap|5,300 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Sillitto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="text-book" /&gt;

An experiment in 2005 undertook a variation of the 1774 work: instead of computing local differences in the zenith, the experiment made a very accurate comparison of the period of a pendulum at the top and bottom of Schiehallion. The period of a pendulum is a function of ''[[g-force|g]]'', the local [[gravitational acceleration]]. The pendulum is expected to run more slowly at altitude, but the mass of the mountain will act to reduce this difference. This experiment has the advantage of being considerably easier to conduct than the 1774 one, but to achieve the desired accuracy, it is necessary to measure the period of the pendulum to within one part in one million.&lt;ref name="countingthoughts" /&gt; This experiment yielded a value of the mass of the Earth of {{nowrap|8.1 ± 2.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countingthoughts.com/ct/wtw/schiehallion%20results%20june.doc|title=The "Weigh the World" Challenge Results | publisher=countingthoughts |accessdate=28 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to a mean density of {{nowrap|7,500 ± 1,900 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Taking the volume of the Earth to be {{math|1.0832 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern re-examination of the geophysical data was able to take account of factors the 1774 team could not. With the benefit of a 120-km radius [[digital elevation model]], greatly improved knowledge of the geology of Schiehallion, and in particular a computer, a 2007 report produced a mean Earth density of {{nowrap|5,480 ± 250 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Smallwood"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smallwood|first=J.R.|date=2007|title=Maskelyne's 1774 Schiehallion experiment revisited|journal=Scottish Journal of Geology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=15&amp;nbsp;31 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/geol/sjg/2007/00000043/00000001/art00003|doi=10.1144/sjg43010015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to the modern figure of {{nowrap|5,515 kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it stood as a testament to the accuracy of Maskelyne's astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="Smallwood" /&gt;

==Mathematical procedure==
[[File:Schiehallion.svg|right|thumb|300px|alt=See accompanying text.|Schiehallion [[force diagram]]]]
Consider the [[force diagram]] to the right, in which the deflection has been greatly exaggerated. The analysis has been simplified by considering the attraction on only one side of the mountain.&lt;ref name="Ranalli" /&gt; A plumb-bob of mass&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|m}} is situated a distance&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|d}} from {{mvar|P}}, the [[centre of mass]] of a mountain of mass&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|M&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;}} and [[density]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|ρ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;}}. It is deflected through a small angle&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|θ}} due to its attraction&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|F}} towards {{mvar|P}} and its [[weight]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|W}} directed towards the Earth. The [[vector sum]] of {{mvar|W}} and {{mvar|F}} results in a [[Tension (physics)|tension]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|T}} in the pendulum string. The Earth has a mass&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|M&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}}, radius&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}} and a density&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The two gravitational forces on the plumb-bob are given by [[Newton's law of gravitation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
F = \frac {G m M_M} {d^2} ,\quad W = \frac {G m M_E} {r_E^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where {{mvar|G}} is [[Gravitational constant|Newton's gravitational constant]]. {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|m}} can be eliminated by taking the ratio of {{mvar|F}} to {{mvar|W}}:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {F} {W} 
= \frac {(G m M_M) / d^2} {(G m M_E) / r_E^2} 
= \frac {M_M}{M_E} {\left( \frac {r_E}{d} \right)}^2
= \frac {\rho_M} {\rho_E} \frac {V_M} {V_E} {\left( \frac {r_E}{d} \right)}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Where {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the volumes of the mountain and the Earth. Under [[static equilibrium]], the horizontal and vertical components of the string tension&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|T}} can be related to the gravitational forces and the deflection angle&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|θ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;
W = T \cos \theta ,\quad F = T \sin \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for {{mvar|T}}:

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan \theta
= \frac {F} {W} 
= \frac {\rho_M}{\rho_E} \frac {V_M}{V_E} {\left( \frac {r_E}{d} \right)}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}} are all known, {{mvar|θ}} has been measured and {{mvar|d}} has been computed, then a value for the ratio&amp;nbsp;{{math|''ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''}} can be obtained:&lt;ref name="Ranalli" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\rho_E}{\rho_M} = \frac {V_M}{V_E} {\left( \frac {r_E}{d} \right)}^2 \frac {1}{\tan \theta}
&lt;/math&gt;

A '''solecism''' is a [[Grammatical phrase|phrase]] that transgresses the rules of grammar.&lt;ref name="Garner2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan A Garner|title=A dictionary of modern legal usage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35dZpfMmxqsC&amp;pg=PA816|accessdate=20 May 2013|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514236-5|page=816}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is associated with [[linguistic prescriptivism]].

==Etymology==
The word originally was used by the Greeks for what they perceived as grammatical mistakes in their language. Ancient [[Ancient Athens|Athenians]] considered the dialect of the inhabitants of [[Soli, Cilicia|Soli, Cicilia]] to be a [[Corruption (grammar)|corrupted]] form of their pure [[Attic Greek|Attic]] dialect, and labelled the errors in the form as "solecisms" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: σολοικισμοί, ''soloikismoí''; sing.: σολοικισμός, ''soloikismós''). Therefore, when referring to similar grammatical mistakes heard in the speech of Athenians, they described them as "solecisms" and that term has been adopted as a label for grammatical mistakes in any language; in Greek there is often a distinction in the relevant terms in that a mistake in [[semantics]] (i.e., a use of words with other-than-appropriate meaning or a neologism constructed through application of generative rules by an outsider) is called a ''barbarism'' ({{lang|el|βαρβαρισμός}} ''barbarismos''), whereas ''solecism'' refers to mistakes in syntax, in the construction of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|soloikismo/s|σολοικισμός|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|- valign="top"
! Name !! Type of grammatical breach !! Example
|- valign="top"
| [[Catachresis]]   ||Wrong [[grammatical case]] || "This is just between you and '''I'''" for "This is just between you and ''me''" ([[hypercorrection]] to avoid the correct "you and me" form in the predicate of [[Copula (linguistics)|copulative]] sentences, even though "me" is the standard pronoun for the object of a preposition or the object of a verb).

"'''Whom''' shall I say is calling?" for "''Who'' shall I say is calling?" (hypercorrection resulting from the perception that "[[who (pronoun)|whom]]" is a formal version of "who" or that the pronoun is functioning as an object when, in fact, it is a subject [One would say, "Shall I say ''who'' is calling?]. The leading pronoun only could be an object if "say" were used transitively and the sentence were structured thus: "Whom shall I say to be calling?")
|- valign="top"
| Catachresis  || Double [[subject (grammar)|subject]]|| "The '''woman, she''' is here" for "The ''woman'' is here" or "''She'' is here" (nonstandard usage with the double subject "she")
|- valign="top"
| Catachresis   || [[Double negative]]|| "She '''can't hardly''' sleep" for "She ''can hardly'' sleep" (a [[double negative]], as both "can't" and "hardly" have a negative meaning)
|- valign="top"
| Catachresis   ||[[Double copula]] || "The issue '''is, is''' his attitude is poor." for "The issue ''is'' his attitude is poor."
|- valign="top"
| Catachresis   || Wrong [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] || "The reason '''being'''..." for "The reason ''is''..."

This usage is grammatically correct in a [[subordinate clause]] with an [[adverb]]ial function, e.g. ''The engineer stopped the train, the reason being a report of track failure ahead.''

In other grammatical contexts, it is a solecism because ''being'' is a [[participle]], and thus cannot form a complete sentence as a full [[verb]] can.
|- valign="top"
| Grammatical error   || Improper [[Complementizer#Empty_complementizers|empty complementizer]] || "The issue '''is his''' attitude is poor." for "The issue ''is that'' his attitude is poor."
The copula does not allow an empty complementizer. "The issue is his poor attitude." (without a complementizer phrase) and "They said his attitude is poor." (a sentence allowing an empty complementizer) would not require this.

'''Sophistication''' has come to mean a few things, but its original definition was "to denature, or simplify". Today it is common as a measure of refinement—displaying [[Taste (sociology)|good taste]], [[wisdom]] and subtlety rather than crudeness, [[stupidity]] and [[vulgarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OjwEQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Sophistication |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History |author=Faye Hammill|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the perception of [[social class]], sophistication can be linked with concepts such as [[social status|status]], [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]] and [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;

== Scope of sophistication ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In social terms, the connotations of sophistication depends on whether one is an insider or an outsider of the sophisticated class.  Sophistication can be seen as "a form of snobbery," or as "among the most desirable of human qualities."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of style conveys an idea of the range of possible elements through which one can demonstrate sophistication in [[elegance]] and [[fashion]], covering the art of "[...] the shoemaker, the hairdresser, the cosmetologist, the cookbook writers, the chef, the diamond merchant, the couturieres, and the fashion queens, the inventors of the folding umbrella ... and of champagne."&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In [[Ancient Greece]], ''sophia'' was the special [[insight]] of [[poet]]s and [[prophet]]s.  This then became the wisdom of [[philosophers]] such as [[sophists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sophistication |author=Mark Backman |chapter=The Roots of Our Sophistication |isbn=978-0-918024-91-6 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But their use of [[rhetoric]] to win arguments gave sophistication a derogatory quality. Sophistry was then the art of misleading.

The system of modern Western sophistication has its roots in France, arguably helped along its way by the policies of King [[Louis XIV]] (reigned 1643–1715).&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| last       = DeJean
| first      = Joan
| title         = The essence of style: how the French invented high fashion, fine food, chic cafes, style, sophistication, and glamour
| year      = 2003
| publisher = Free Press
| location  = New York
| isbn      = 978-0-7432-6413-6
| page      = 3
| quote         = In the sixteenth century, the French were not thought of as the most elegant or the most sophisticated European nation. By the early eighteenth century, however, people all over Europe declared that 'the French are stylish' or 'the French know good food,' just as they said, 'the Dutch are clean.' France had acquired a sort of monopoly on culture, style, and luxury living, a position that it has occupied ever since. [...] Beginning in the late seventeenth century, travelers were saying what novelists and filmmakers are still repeating: travel to Paris was guaranteed to add a touch of magic to every life. [...] [F]rom this moment on, that touch of magic became widely desired: elegance, luxury, and sophistication became factors to be reckoned with.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The English regarded sophistication as decadent and deceptive until the aristocratic [[sensibility|sensibilities]] and refined elegance of Regency [[dandy|dandies]] such as [[Beau Brummell]] (1778–1840) became fashionable and admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=413279&amp;sectioncode=26 |journal=[[Times Higher Education]] |author=Deborah Longworth |date=2 Sep 2010 |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of sophistication ==

Recognised varieties of sophistication include:

* cultural sophistication&lt;ref&gt;
For example:
{{cite book
| last       = Holt
| first      =  Douglas
|author2=Douglas Cameron
 | title         = Cultural Strategy: Using Innovative Ideologies to Build Breakthrough Brands
| url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=PNEQ7gGDGVwC
| accessdate    = 2011-02-24
| year      = 2010
| publisher = Oxford University Press
| isbn      = 0-19-958740-X
| pages      = 91–92
| quote         = The pursuit of cultural sophistication (Bourdieu's cultural capital) was until recently a niche phenomenon in America. It existed mainly in 'old-money' families, which dominated elite breeding grounds (prep schools, Ivy league universities, elite liberal arts colleges), and in the small Bohemian circles in the country's biggest cities. [...] The transformation of the American class dynamic from a single-minded striving for economic abundance to a multi-dimensional striving for sophistication in addition to abundance – a mixture of status pursuits more typical of Europe – was seeded in the 1960s.                   = adam markovich
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;(or culturedness)
* intellectual sophistication&lt;ref&gt;
For example:{{cite book
| last       = Hodgson
| first      = Marshall G. S
| authorlink = Marshall Hodgson
| title         = The venture of Islam: conscience and history in a world civilization
| url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=LKO5GRC8j1MC
| accessdate    = 2011-02-24
| volume    = 3
| year      = 1974
| publisher = University of Chicago Press
| isbn      = 978-0-226-34684-7
| page      = 323
| quote         = But the mutakallim's universe of discourse now included the whole range of Falsafah with its intellectual sophistication.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the analysis of [[humor]], [[Victor Raskin]] distinguishes "two types of sophistication: limited access, or allusive knowledge, and complex processing".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last       = Attardo
| first      = Salvatore
| authorlink = Salvatore Attardo
| title         = Linguistic theories of humor

| year      = 1994
| publisher = Walter de Gruyter
| isbn      = 978-3-11-014255-6
| page      = 216
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquiring sophistication ==

Methods of acquiring the appearance of personal sophistication include:

* educational travel – note the function of the traditional [[Grand Tour]] for European aesthetes&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last       = Warneke
| first      = Sara
| authorlink = Sara Warneke

| series    = Brill's studies in intellectual history
| volume    = 58
| year      = 1995
| publisher = Brill
| isbn      = 978-90-04-10126-5
| page      = 242
| quote         = By the second half of the seventeenth century the experience of the Grand Tour marked the socially successful gentleman. In 1678 Gailhard noted that many travelled Englishmen regarded their home-bred compatriots as their social inferiors and affected foreign accents, fashions and mannerisms in order to demonstrate their sophistication.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Finishing school]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| last1        = Mackintosh
| first1       = Prudence
|date=January 1986
| title        = Little Women
| journal      = [[Texas Monthly]]
| volume       = 14
| issue        = 1
| pages        = 154
| publisher    = Emmis Communications
| issn         = 0148-7736
| accessdate   = 2011-02-24
| url          = https://books.google.com/books?id=5isEAAAAMBAJ
| quote        = 1913 [–] Miss Ela Hockaday opens a finishing school in Dallas and single-handedly creates the Texas ideal of what a lady should be. [...] [D]aughters from remote West Texas ranches gained a measure of sophistication.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On a societal level commentators can associate various forms of sophistication with [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''sorites paradox''' ({{IPAc-en|s|oʊ|'|r|aɪ|t|iː|z}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sorites |website=Omnilexica |url=http://www.omnilexica.com/pronunciation/?q=Sorites}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as the '''paradox of the heap''') is a [[paradox]] that arises from [[vagueness|vague]] [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]].&lt;ref name=Allan2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Barker |first=C. |editor-last=Allan |editor-first=Keith |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Semantics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_1snsgmqU8C&amp;pg=PA1037 |year=2009 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-095968-9 |chapter=Vagueness |page=1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical formulation involves a heap of [[sand]], from which grains are individually removed. Under the assumption that removing a single grain does not turn a heap into a non-heap, the paradox is to consider what happens when the process is repeated enough times: is a single remaining grain still a heap? If not, when did it change from a heap to a non-heap?&lt;ref name=Sorensen2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Sorensen |first=Roy A. |editor1=Jaegwon Kim |editor2-last=Sosa |editor2-first=Ernest |editor3-last=Rosenkrantz |editor3-first=Gary S. |title=A Companion to Metaphysics |chapter=sorites arguments |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-5298-3 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7PG-Vk824UC&amp;pg=PA565 |page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The original formulation and variations ==

===Paradox of the heap===
The word "sorites" derives from the Greek word for heap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Many-Valued and Fuzzy Logic: Semantics, Algebras, and Derivation Systems|last = Bergmann|first = Merrie|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-521-88128-9|location = New York, NY|page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=zEwNfoAZEGoC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox is so named because of its original characterization, attributed to [[Eubulides|Eubulides of Miletus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Barnes|1982}}, {{Harv|Burnyeat|1982}}, {{Harv|Williamson|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox goes as follows: consider a [[wikt:heap|heap]] of sand from which [[grain]]s are individually removed. One might construct the argument, using [[premise]]s, as follows:&lt;ref name=Sorensen2009/&gt;

:''{{val|1000000|fmt=commas}} grains of sand is a heap of sand'' (Premise 1)
:''A heap of sand minus one grain is still a heap.'' (Premise 2)

[[Mathematical induction|Repeated applications]] of Premise 2 (each time starting with one fewer grain) eventually forces one to accept the [[logical consequence|conclusion]] that a heap may be composed of just one grain of sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9205.2004.t01-1-00230.x| title = Why Induction Is No Cure For Baldness| year = 2004| last1 = Dolev | first1 = Y.| journal = Philosophical Investigations| volume = 27| issue = 4| pages = 328–344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Read (1995) observes that "the argument is itself a heap, or sorites, of steps of ''[[modus ponens]]''":&lt;ref name="Read"&gt;Read, Stephen (1995). ''Thinking About Logic'', p.174. Oxford. {{ISBN|019289238X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''{{val|1000000|fmt=commas}} grains is a heap.''
:''If {{val|1000000|fmt=commas}} grains is a heap then {{val|999999|fmt=commas}} grains is a heap.''
:''So {{val|999999|fmt=commas}} grains is a heap.''
:''If {{val|999999|fmt=commas}} grains is a heap then {{val|999998|fmt=commas}} grains is a heap.''
:''So {{val|999998|fmt=commas}} grains is a heap.''
:''If ...''
:''... So {{val|1}} grain is a heap.''

===Variations===
[[File:Color gradient illustrating a sorites paradox with labels.png|thumb|Color gradient illustrating a sorites paradox, any adjacent colors being indistinguishable by the human eye]]

{{Quote|Then tension between small changes and big [[causality|consequences]] gives rise to the Sorites Paradox...There are many variations...[some of which allow] consideration of the difference between being...(a question of [[fact]]) and seeming...(a question of [[perception]]).&lt;ref name=Allan2009/&gt;}}

Another formulation is to start with a grain of sand, which is clearly not a heap, and then assume that adding a single grain of sand to something that is not a heap does not turn it into a heap. Inductively, this process can be repeated as much as one wants without ever constructing a heap.&lt;ref name=Allan2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorensen2009/&gt; A more natural formulation of this variant is to assume a set of colored chips exists such that two adjacent chips vary in color too little for human eyesight to be able to distinguish between them. Then by induction on this premise, humans would not be able to distinguish between any colors.&lt;ref name=Allan2009/&gt;

The removal of one drop from the ocean, will not make it 'not an ocean' (it is still an ocean), but since the volume of water in the ocean is finite, eventually, after enough removals, even a litre of water left is still an ocean.

This paradox can be reconstructed for a variety of predicates, for example, with "tall", "rich", "old", "blue", "bald", and so on. [[Bertrand Russell]] argued that all of natural language, even logical connectives, is vague; moreover, representations of propositions are vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |authorlink=Bertrand Russell|date=June 1923 |title=Vagueness |journal=The Australasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=84–92 |issn=1832-8660 |doi=10.1080/00048402308540623 |url=http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Russell/vagueness|accessdate=November 18, 2009 }} [[Cosma Shalizi|Shalizi]]'s [http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Russell/vagueness/ 1995 etext] is archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20080515181625/cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Russell/vagueness/ at archive.org] and [https://www.webcitation.org/5lNl9fNiP at WebCite].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed resolutions==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2009}}
{{Original research|section|date=August 2009}}

On the face of it, there are some ways to avoid this conclusion. One [[Denying the antecedent|may object to the first premise]] by denying {{val|1000000|fmt=commas}} grains of sand makes a [[dict:heap|heap]]. But {{val|1000000|fmt=commas}} is just an arbitrarily large number, and the argument will go through with any such number. So the response must [[dict:deny|deny]] outright that there are such things as heaps. [[Peter Unger]] defends this solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Unger |first=Peter |title=There Are No Ordinary Things |journal=Synthese |year=1979 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=117–154 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00869568#page-1 |accessdate=19 July 2013 |doi=10.1007/bf00869568 |jstor=20115446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, one may object to the second premise by stating that it is not true for all heaps of sand that removing one grain from it still makes a heap.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Setting a fixed boundary===
A common first response to the paradox is to call any set of grains that has more than a certain number of grains in it a heap. If one were to set the "fixed boundary" at, say, {{val|10000|fmt=commas}} grains then one would claim that for fewer than {{val|10000|fmt=commas}}, it is not a heap; for {{val|10000|fmt=commas}} or more, then it is a heap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Rory |title=On the Borders of Vagueness and the Vagueness of Borders |journal=Vassar College Journal of Philosophy |date=2018 |volume=5 |page=32 |url=https://philosophy.vassar.edu/docs/2018-spring-VCJP%20Borders%20w%20CFP.pdf |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such solutions are unsatisfactory as there seems little significance to the difference between {{val|9999|fmt=commas}} grains and {{val|10000|fmt=commas}} grains. The boundary, wherever it may be set, remains as arbitrary and so its precision is misleading. It is objectionable on both philosophical and linguistic grounds: the former on account of its arbitrariness, and the latter on the ground that it is simply not how we use natural language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Rory |title=On the Borders of Vagueness and the Vagueness of Borders |journal=Vassar College Journal of Philosophy |date=2018 |volume=5 |page=35 |url=https://philosophy.vassar.edu/docs/2018-spring-VCJP%20Borders%20w%20CFP.pdf |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second response attempts to find a fixed boundary that reflects common usage of a term. For example, a dictionary may define a "heap" as "a collection of things thrown together so as to form an elevation."&lt;ref&gt;"[[wikt:heap|heap]]". ''Wiktionary''. Accessed 2017-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt; This requires there to be enough grains that some grains are supported by other grains. Thus, adding one grain atop a single layer produces a heap, and removing the last grain above the bottom layer destroys the heap.

===Unknowable boundaries (or epistemicism)===
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
[[Timothy Williamson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williamson |first=Timothy |title=Inexact Knowledge |journal=Mind |year=1992 |volume=101 |issue=402 |pages=218–242 |jstor=2254332 |doi=10.1093/mind/101.402.217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williamson |first=Timothy |title=Vagueness and Ignorance |journal=Supplementary Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society |year=1992 |volume=66 |pages=145–162 |jstor=4106976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Williamson |title=Vagueness |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roy Sorensen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sorensen |first=Roy |title=Blindspots |year=1988 |publisher=Clarendeon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; hold an approach that there are fixed boundaries but that they are necessarily unknowable.

===Supervaluationism===

[[Supervaluationism]] is a semantics for dealing with irreferential [[singular term]]s and [[vagueness]]. It allows one to retain the usual [[tautology (logic)|tautological laws]] even when dealing with undefined truth values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fine |first=Kit |title=Vagueness, Truth and Logic |journal=Synthese |date=Apr–May 1975 |volume=30 | number= 3/4|pages=265–300 |doi=10.1007/BF00485047 |jstor=20115033 |url=http://www.niu.edu/~gpynn/Fine_Vagueness_Truth%26Logic.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://ontologievorlesung.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/van-fraassen-gaps-and-singular-terms.pdf | first=Bas C. |last=van Fraassen |author-link=Bas van Fraassen| title=Singular Terms, Truth-Value Gaps, and Free Logic | journal=Journal of Philosophy | volume=63 | number=17 | pages=481–495 | year=1966 | doi=10.2307/2024549 | jstor=2024549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kamp |first=Hans |editor-last=Keenan |editor-first=E. |title=Two Theories about Adjectives |year=1975 |pages=123–155 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dummett |first=Michael |title=Wang's Paradox |journal=Synthese |year=1975 |volume=30 |issue=3/4 |pages=301–324 |doi=10.1007/BF00485048 |jstor=20115034 |url=http://wylieb.com/Philosophy/ElectronicTexts/Transitivity/Dummett1975.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As an example for a proposition about an irreferential singular term, consider the sentence "''[[Pegasus]] likes [[licorice]]''".
Since the name "''Pegasus''" [[failure of reference|fails to refer]], no [[truth value]] can be assigned to the sentence; there is nothing in the myth that would justify any such assignment. However, there are some statements about "''Pegasus''" which have definite truth values nevertheless, such as "''Pegasus likes licorice or Pegasus doesn't like licorice''". This sentence is an instance of the tautology "&lt;math&gt;p \vee \neg p&lt;/math&gt;", i.e. the valid schema "''&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; or not-&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;''". According to supervaluationism, it should be true regardless of whether or not its components have a truth value.

Similarly, "''{{val|1000|fmt=commas}} grains of sand is a heap of sand''" may be considered a border case having no truth value, but "''{{val|1000|fmt=commas}} grains of sand is a heap of sand, or {{val|1000|fmt=commas}} grains of sand is not a heap of sand''" should be true.

Precisely, let &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; be a classical [[valuation (logic)|valuation]] defined on every [[atomic sentence]] of the language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;At(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of distinct atomic sentences in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Then for every sentence &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, at most &lt;math&gt;2^{At(x)}&lt;/math&gt; distinct classical valuations can exist. A supervaluation &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a function from sentences to truth values such that, a sentence &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is super-true (i.e. &lt;math&gt;V(x) = \text{True}&lt;/math&gt;) if and only if &lt;math&gt;v(x) = \text{True}&lt;/math&gt; for every classical valuation &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;; likewise for super-false. Otherwise, &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; is undefined—i.e. exactly when there are two classical valuations &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;v(x)=\text{True}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v'(x) = \text{False}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, let &lt;math&gt;L \; p&lt;/math&gt; be the formal translation of "''Pegasus likes licorice''". Then there are exactly two classical valuations &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v'&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;L \; p&lt;/math&gt;, viz. &lt;math&gt;v(L \; p) = \text{True}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v'(L \; p) = \text{False}&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;L \; p&lt;/math&gt; is neither super-true nor super-false. However, the tautology &lt;math&gt;L \; p \lor \lnot L \; p&lt;/math&gt; is evaluated to &lt;math&gt;\text{True}&lt;/math&gt; by every classical valuation; it is hence super-true. Similarly, the formalization of the above heap proposition &lt;math&gt;H \; 1000&lt;/math&gt; is neither super-true nor super-false, but &lt;math&gt;H \; 1000 \lor \lnot H \; 1000&lt;/math&gt; is super-true.

===Truth gaps, gluts, and multi-valued logics===
Another approach is to use a [[multi-valued logic]]. From this point of view, the problem is with the [[principle of bivalence]]: the sand is either a heap or is not a heap, without any shades of gray. Instead of two logical states, ''heap'' and ''not-heap'', a three value system can be used, for example ''heap'', ''indeterminate'' and ''not-heap''. However, three valued systems do not truly resolve the paradox as there is still a dividing line between ''heap'' and ''indeterminate'' and also between ''indeterminate'' and ''not-heap''. The third truth-value can be understood either as a ''truth-value gap'' or as a ''truth-value glut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-values/ | title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| chapter=Truth Values| publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[fuzzy logic]] offers a continuous spectrum of logical states represented in the [[unit interval]] of real numbers [0,1]—it is a many-valued logic with infinitely-many truth-values, and thus the sand moves smoothly from "definitely heap" to "definitely not heap", with shades in the intermediate region. Fuzzy hedges are used to divide the continuum into regions corresponding to classes like ''definitely heap'', ''mostly heap'', ''partly heap'', ''slightly heap'', and ''not heap''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zadeh |first=L. A. |title=Fuzzy Sets |journal=Information and Control |year=1965 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=338–353 |doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(65)90241-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goguen |first=J. A. |title=The Logic of Inexact Concepts |journal=Synthese |year=1969 |volume=19 |issue=3–4 |pages=325–378 |doi=10.1007/BF00485654 |jstor=20114646 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;Though the problem remains of where these borders occur; e.g. at what number of grains sand starts being 'definitely' a heap.

===Hysteresis===
Another approach, introduced by Raffman,&lt;ref&gt;Unruly Words: A Study of Vague Language (OUP, 2014){{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to use [[hysteresis]], that is, knowledge of what the collection of sand started as. Equivalent amounts of sand may be called heaps or not based on how they got there. If a large heap (indisputably described as a heap) is slowly diminished, it preserves its "heap status" to a point, even as the actual amount of sand is reduced to a smaller number of grains. For example, suppose {{val|500}} grains is a pile and {{val|1000|fmt=commas}} grains is a heap. There will be an overlap for these states. So if one is reducing it from a heap to a pile, it is a heap going down until, say, {{val|750}}. At that point one would stop calling it a heap and start calling it a pile. But if one replaces one grain, it would not instantly turn back into a heap. When going up it would remain a pile until, say, {{val|900}} grains. The numbers picked are arbitrary; the point is, that the same amount can be either a heap or a pile depending on what it was before the change. A common use of hysteresis would be the thermostat for air conditioning: the AC is set at 77&amp;nbsp;°F and it then cools down to just below 77&amp;nbsp;°F, but does not turn on again instantly at 77.001&amp;nbsp;°F—it waits until almost 78&amp;nbsp;°F, to prevent instant change of state over and over again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8284.2005.00558.x |jstor=3329033 | title = How to understand contextualism about vagueness: reply to Stanley| year = 2005| last1 = Raffman | first1 = D.| journal = Analysis| volume = 65| issue = 287| pages = 244–248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group consensus===
{{original research|date=October 2014}}
One can establish the meaning of the word "heap" by appealing to [[consensus]]. Williamson, in his epistemic solution to the paradox, assumes that the meaning of vague terms must be determined by group usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Rory |title=On the Borders of Vagueness and the Vagueness of Borders |journal=Vassar College Journal of Philosophy |date=2018 |volume=5 |page=33 |url=https://philosophy.vassar.edu/docs/2018-spring-VCJP%20Borders%20w%20CFP.pdf |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus approach typically claims that a collection of grains is as much a "heap" as the proportion of people in a [[social group|group]] who believe it to be so. In other words, the ''[[probability]]'' that any collection is considered a heap is the [[expected value]] of the distribution of the group's views.

A group may decide that:
*One grain of sand on its own is not a heap.
*A large collection of grains of sand is a heap.

Between the two extremes, individual members of the group may disagree with each other over whether any particular collection can be labelled a "heap". The collection can then not be definitively claimed to ''be'' a "heap" or "not a heap". This can be considered an appeal to [[descriptive linguistics]] rather than [[prescriptive linguistics]], as it resolves the issue of definition based on how the population uses natural language. Indeed, if a precise prescriptive definition of "heap" is available then the group consensus will always be unanimous and the paradox does not arise.

===Dropping transitivity of the relations involved===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
In the [[#Variations|above]] color example, the argument is tacitly based on considering the relation "for the human eye, color ''X'' is indistinguishable from ''Y''" as an [[equivalence relation]], in particular as [[Transitive relation#Formal definition|transitive]].  To drop the transitivity assumption is a possibility to resolve the paradox.

Similarly, the paradox is based on considering the relation "for the human eye, color ''X'' looks more or equally red than ''Y''" as a reflexive [[total ordering]]; again, dropping its transitivity resolves the paradox.

Instead, the relation between colors can be described as a [[quasitransitive relation]], employing a concept introduced by [[microeconomist]] Amartya Sen in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sen | first=Amartya | authorlink=Amartya Sen | title=Quasi-transitivity, rational choice and collective decisions | zbl=0181.47302 | journal=The Review of Economic Studies | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=381–393 | year=1969 | doi=10.2307/2296434 | jstor=2296434 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The table shows a simple example, with color differences overdone for readability. A "Q" and a "T" indicates that the row's color looks more or equally red than column's color in the quasitransitive and the transitive version of the relation, respectively. In the quasitransitive version, e.g. the colors '''{{color|#f01000|f01000}}''' and '''{{color|#e02000|e02000}}''' are modelled as indistinguishable, since a "Q" appears in both their intersection cells. A "P" indicates the [[Quasitransitive relation#Formal definition|asymmetric part]] of the quasitransitive version.

To resolve the original heap variation of the paradox with this approach, the relation "''X'' grains are more a heap than ''Y'' grains" should be considered quasitransitive rather than transitive.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}{{clarify|date=December 2016|reason=How does it resolve?}}

'''Sustainable Archaeology''' (SA) is a digital archaeological research facility and  collections repository that advances a sustainable form of practice and research [[archaeology]] in [[Ontario]]. Sustainable Archaeology is an inter-institutional collaborative research facility between the [[University of Western Ontario]] (Western) and [[McMaster University]].

Sustainable Archaeology's research facilities are located in [[London, Ontario]], and [[Hamilton, Ontario]].

Sustainable Archaeology is funded by the [[Canadian Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) and the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation Ontario Research Fund (ORF).

Sustainable Archaeology consolidates [[archaeological]] collections from across Ontario digitally into the [[#Informational Platform|Informational Platform]], a web-based [[database]] and research interface, bringing together thousands of collections generated through research and commercial or [[cultural resource management]] (CRM) archaeology in Ontario. Collections are held in-trust by Sustainable Archaeology for the people of Ontario.&lt;ref name="SustainableArchaeology"&gt;''Sustainable Archaeology Collections Procedures and Standards''. Document on file at Sustainable Archaeology. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The consolidation of data and collections facilitates collaborative research between divergent fields of archaeological study, and access to both recent and previously excavated archaeological materials. [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifact]]s, field records, contextual datasets, and reporting are converted into digital information and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] images and integrated into the Informational Platform, a web-based research oriented database system.

== Background ==
Since the 1970s, provincial legislation in Ontario has mandated that lands projected for development must first be assessed for evidence of [[cultural heritage]], including [[archaeological sites]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Tourism and Culture (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport]]. [http://www.mtc.gov.on.ca/en/archaeology/archaeology_planning.shtml "Land Use Planning and Development"] Accessed 31 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the number of archaeological sites identified and excavated in the province, and the amount of data and collections amassed, has grown steadily over the past several decades.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, Neal and Aubrey Cannon, [https://www.academia.edu/1660165/Capacities_for_a_Sustainable_Archaeology "Capacities for a Sustainable Archaeology"], Paper presented at the [[Ontario Archaeological Society]] Annual Meeting, Waterloo, Ontario, 17 October 2009. Accessed 30 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, 80-90% of archaeological practice in Ontario is conducted as commercial-based fieldwork, undertaken on behalf of the public and private sector by [[cultural resource management]] (CRM) companies.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Archaeology. http://sustainablearchaeology.org/. Accessed 30 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of archaeological artifacts from licensed excavations has exceeded storage capabilities in Ontario. Collections have remained largely inaccessible to researchers, students, and local and Descendant communities.&lt;ref name="academia"&gt;Ferris and Cannon, [https://www.academia.edu/1660165/Capacities_for_a_Sustainable_Archaeology "Capacities for a Sustainable Archaeology"]&lt;/ref&gt; This "crisis" in curation reflects broader trends in the management of archaeological collections internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Lynne P. and S. Terry Childs. ''Curating Archaeological Collections: From the Field to the Repository''. Oxford: AltaMira Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project Development ===
In 2009 Dr. Neal Ferris of the University of Western Ontario was awarded a $9.8 million grant from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Research and Innovation.[http://www.mri.gov.on.ca/english/news/ORF120709_bd1.asp "Funding Announcement: Projects Funded in London"], 7 December 2009. Accessed 30 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Foundation for Innovation. [http://www.innovation.ca/en/Media/News/GovernmentCanadaInvestsinResearchInfrastructure "Government of Canada Invests in Research Infrastructure"], 18 June 2009. Accessed 30 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The grant was awarded for the collaborative initiative between University of Western Ontario under Dr. Ferris as the [[Principal Investigator]], and McMaster University, under Principal Investigator Dr. Aubrey Cannon to establish a research and digital data cooperative and physical repository for collections. Construction of the Western facility in London, Ontario began in the fall of 2010. The London facility is located off-campus, adjacent to the [[Museum of Ontario Archaeology]]. The McMaster facility was constructed off-campus in a renovated space at [[McMaster Innovation Park]] in Hamilton, Ontario.

Construction at the Western facility was completed in the fall of 2011. Renovations at the McMaster facility at McMaster Innovation Park were completed in 2012.

==Mission statement==
Sustainable Archaeology operates under the following mission statement:

"Sustainable Archaeology is dedicated to advancing a transformative practice of archaeology that integrates the many forms of the discipline – commercial, academic, avocational – by consolidating the extensively recovered archaeological record from Ontario and converting that material and contextual data into broadly accessible digital information, to allow for ongoing and innovative research that engages with this compiled and rich archaeological heritage left by the countless previous generations of those who loved, lived, and died in this place, and by all those today who draw connections, meaning, value, and identity from the human heritage of this place."&lt;ref name="SustainableArchaeology" /&gt;

== Informational Platform ==
The Sustainable Archaeology Informational Platform is a web-based research oriented database system that incorporates a range of diverse data sets, including direct access to raw artifact data. The database serves as means of [[digital curation]] for site reports, maps and [[archaeological plan|site plans]], [[geographic information system|geospatial data]], photographs, and other datasets generated by archaeological studies and excavations in Ontario, and linked to collections held physically at the two facilities.&lt;ref name="academia" /&gt; The Informational Platform incorporates value added studies completed at the Sustainable Archaeology facilities, including macro and microscopic analyses, and digital imaging.&lt;ref name="academia" /&gt; The Informational Platform is informed by both archaeological and descendant community cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Westby, Kira.

'''''Taking Rights Seriously''''' is a 1977 book about the [[philosophy of law]] by [[Ronald Dworkin]]. In this landmark book, Dworkin argues against the dominant philosophy of Anglo-American [[legal positivism]] as presented by [[H. L. A. Hart]] in ''The Concept of Law'' (1961) and [[utilitarianism]] by proposing that rights of the individual against the state exist outside of the written law and function as "trumps" against the interests or wishes of the majority.

Most of the book's chapters are revised versions of previously published papers. In addition to his critique of legal positivism and utilitarian ethics, Dworkin includes important discussions of constitutional interpretation, judicial discretion, [[civil disobedience]], reverse discrimination, [[John Rawls]]' theory of justice, and the Hart–Devlin debate on legislating morality.

A revised edition of book was published in 1978 and includes a lengthy reply by Dworkin to his critics.

'''''The Birds of Haiti and the Dominican Republic''''' is a book published as no.155 in the [[zoology|zoological]] [[monograph]] series ''Bulletin of the United States National Museum''.  It was authored by [[Alexander Wetmore]], with the assistance of Bradshaw H. Swales, and was published by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington DC]] in 1931.  It is in [[octavo]] format (248 x 156&amp;nbsp;mm) and contains iv + 484 pages bound in a grey paper cover.  It includes 26 [[black-and-white]] plates, both of paintings of the birds by [[Allan Brooks]], and of photographs of the habitat.

The book is an [[ornithology|ornithological]] treatise on the [[bird|avifauna]] of the island of [[Hispaniola]] (divided between the nations of [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]) in the [[Caribbean]].  It is based on the fieldwork carried out, and [[Collection (museum)|collections]] made, by various expeditions there, especially those of [[William Louis Abbott]], and of Wetmore himself.

The first 57 pages of the book are taken up by accounts of the [[physiography]] of the island, the history of ornithological exploration and of fieldwork for the Smithsonian Institution there, as well as a general discussion of the avifauna.  This section also contains notes on adjacent islands including [[Gonâve Island|Gonave]], [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortue]], [[Cayemites|Grande Cayemite]], [[Saona Island|Saona]], and [[Navassa Island|Navassa]].  The rest of the book comprises individual accounts of the bird species recorded from Hispaniola, ending with a comprehensive [[bibliography]] and [[Index (publishing)|index]].

'''''The Faith of Our Fathers: a Plain Exposition and Vindication of the Church Founded by Our Lord Jesus Christ''''' is a book by archbishop [[James Gibbons]] which was published in Baltimore in 1876,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0pM77M1OrkrTDGast4&amp;id=uIVNCtk5bSwC&amp;pg=PA3 The Faith of Our Fathers]''&lt;/ref&gt; which became a best-selling conversion manual in the [[United States]] and by 1980 was in its 111th printing. 

In his 1917 preface to the 83rd edition, the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] noted that "since the first edition appeared, in 1876 up to the present time, fourteen hundred thousand copies have been published and the circulation of the book is constantly increasing. The work has been translated into nearly all the [[languages of Europe]]." The well-known agnostic, literary critic and fellow Baltimorean [[H. L. Mencken]] wrote, in his survey of religion ''Treatise on the Gods'', that "the best exposition of [[Catholic]] doctrine is probably ''The Faith of our Fathers''', by the late Cardinal Gibbons."

'''''The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore''''' is a 2011 animated short film directed by [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] and [[Brandon Oldenburg]], and produced by [[Moonbot Studios]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higa |first=Michelle |title=The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore |url=http://www.shortoftheweek.com/2012/01/24/the-fantastic-flying-books-of-mr-morris-lessmore |publisher=Short of the Week |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as an "allegory about the curative powers of story," the film centers on [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] Lessmore and his custodianship of a magical library of flying books. It was created using [[computer animation]], [[Scale model|miniatures]] and traditional hand-drawn techniques.&lt;ref name=LosAngeles&gt;{{cite news|last=Rome|first=Emily|title=Oscar shorts: 'Morris Lessmore' has hybrid animation, iPad app|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/01/oscars-short-films-fantastic-flying-books-morris-lessmore-animation.html|accessdate=March 17, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning over a dozen film festivals, the film was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]] at the [[84th Academy Awards]]. An official [[iPad]] app based on the film was also released in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App Store]]. This however requires updating as it does not work with the current iOS. A book adaptation was released in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore" Nominated for Best Animated Short in 2011 Oscars |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fantastic-flying-books-of-mr-morris-lessmore-nominated-for-best-animated-short-in-2011-oscars-2012-01-24 |publisher=[[MarketWatch]] |date=January 24, 2012 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Morris Lessmore sits on a balcony in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]] writing a memoir. Suddenly a storm strikes, blowing Morris's writing out of his book and blowing him off the balcony. While Morris frantically grabs for his book, the storm blows away the buildings.

After the storm, Morris finds the city and its residents devastated. He walks through the streets strewn with book pages and into the countryside. There he sees a woman fly past, magically suspended by flying books which she is holding with ribbons. She sends one of the books down to Morris. The book's pages flip back and forth to animate an illustration of [[Humpty Dumpty]], who urges Morris to follow him.

The flying book takes Morris to a library where other flying books live. Morris finds no humans there, but notices several portraits on the wall, one of which is the woman he had seen. In the story the books could talk to Morris.

Morris then becomes the proprietor of the library. He takes care of the books, even saving the life of an early French edition of Jules Verne's ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' after it suffers a catastrophic injury falling from a shelf.{{#tag:ref|The large book on which Morris sleeps is the same title; its inclusion may reference the studio's name "Moonbot". The library also includes Moon globes and in one scene the Moon is featured prominently in a window.|group="Note"}} He also gives out books to those who visit the library from the city still suffering from the effects of the storm. Eventually Morris begins to rewrite his memoir, sharing passages with the flying books who gather around him on the grassy hill opposite the library.

Years later Morris, now an old man, finally completes the book. Satisfied with his life's work, he closes the book and heads for the door. The flying books swirl about him and Morris becomes young again. He then flies away, carried by flying books like the woman earlier. As he departs, his book, which had earlier been an ordinary book, becomes a flying book like the others, and returns to the library. Just then, a young girl arrives. She sits down on the steps of the library and begins to read Morris's book as the flying books gather around. The final scene shows Morris's portrait added to the picture wall in the library.

==Inspiration==
[[File:Porkpie.jpg|thumb|left|[[Buster Keaton]] wearing a [[pork pie hat]]]]
The book was inspired by William Morris, children's books publisher at [[HarperCollins]] and Joyce's mentor. Joyce wrote a story about a man who gives his life to books when he was on an airplane flight to visit Morris. Joyce read the story to Morris, who died a few days after that.&lt;ref name=LosAngeles /&gt;

Morris Lessmore was visually modeled after the silent film actor Buster Keaton. The film drew particular inspiration from the storm scene in Keaton's ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]'' and the tornado from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Also an inspiration was the real-life [[Hurricane Katrina]] which devastated New Orleans in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Like ''The Wizard of Oz'', the film utilizes the contrast of color and black-and-white as a narrative device. In this case, the black-and-white represents the sadness and despair brought about by the storm.

==Reception==
[[File:William Joyce Oscar Parade Shreveport Louisiana.jpg|thumb|right|Writer and co-director [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] holding the Academy Award won by the film in 2012]]
The film has received 14 awards, including the Audience Award at the [[Austin Film Festival]], "Best Animated Short" at the [[Cinequest Film Festival]], and the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].

Louisiana Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] congratulated Shreveport-based animation studio Moonbot Studios for winning an Oscar at the 84th Annual Academy Awards in Hollywood. "Louisiana celebrates this Oscar win with the exceptionally talented and creative staff of Moonbot Studios in Shreveport," Jindal said. "We're proud that Louisiana residents and a Louisiana-based company created this groundbreaking work that pays homage to a love of books and perseverance through a love of learning.&lt;ref name=cartoon&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.bcdb.com/louisiana-governor-salutes-moonbot-oscar-3268/ |title=Louisiana governor salutes Moonbot on Oscar |first=Paul|last=Anderson|publisher=Big Cartoon News |date=28 February 2012|accessdate=28 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book adaptation won a [[SIBA Book Award]] (children's category) in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8125">'''Theoretical linguistics''', or '''general linguistics''', is the branch of [[linguistics]] which inquires into the nature of [[language]] itself and seeks to answer fundamental questions as to what language is; how it works; how [[universal grammar]] (UG) as a domain-specific mental organ operates, if it exists at all; what are its unique properties; how does language relate to other cognitive processes, etc. Theoretical linguists are most concerned with constructing models of linguistic knowledge, and ultimately developing a linguistic theory.

The fields that are generally considered the core of theoretical linguistics are phonology, [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], syntax, and semantics. Although [[phonetics]] often guides phonology, it is often excluded from the purview of theoretical linguistics, along with [[semantics]]. Theoretical linguistics also involves the search for an explanation of linguistic universals, that is, properties that all, or many [[language]]s have in common.

==Terminology==

In the first half of the 20th century, the term "general linguistics" was more common (cf. Ferdinand de Saussure's famous ''Course in General Linguistics''), which could be contrasted with "language-particular linguistics" (which is more often called [[descriptive linguistics]]). Since the 1960s, the term "theoretical linguistics" has typically been used in more or less the same sense as "general linguistics", even though it also contrasts with [[applied linguistics]], and even though it is often said that language description is inherently theoretical. The usual terminology is thus not entirely clear and consistent.

==Major fields==
{{See|grammar|formal grammar|grammar framework}}

===Phonetics===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

Phonetics is the study of speech sounds with concentration on three main points :
* Manner of articulation|Articulation: the production of speech sounds in human speech organs.
* [[Perception]] : the way human ears respond to speech signals, how the human brain analyses them.
* Acoustic features : physical characteristics of speech sounds such as, loudness, amplitude, frequency etc.
According to this definition, phonetics can also be called linguistic analysis of human speech at the surface level. That is one obvious difference from [[phonology]], which concerns the structure and organisation of speech sounds in natural languages, and furthermore has a theoretical and abstract nature. One example can be made to illustrate this distinction:
In English, the suffix ''-s'' can represent either {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, or can be silent (written Ø) depending on context.
 
====Articulatory phonetics====

The field of [[articulatory phonetics]] is a subfield of phonetics. In studying [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], phoneticians attempt to document how humans produce speech sounds (vowels and consonants). That is, articulatory phoneticians are interested in how the different structures of the vocal tract, called the articulators (tongue, lips, jaw, palate, teeth etc.), interact to create the specific sounds.

====Auditory phonetics====

[[Auditory phonetics]] is a branch of phonetics concerned with the hearing, acquisition and comprehension of phonetic sounds of words of a language.  As articulatory phonetics explores the methods of sound production, auditory phonetics explores the methods of reception—the ear to the brain, and those processes.

====Acoustic phonetics====

[[Acoustic phonetics]] is a subfield of phonetics which deals with acoustic aspects of speech sounds. Acoustic phonetics investigates properties like the mean squared amplitude of a waveform, its duration, its [[fundamental frequency]], or other properties of its frequency spectrum, and the relationship of these properties to other branches of phonetics (e.g. articulatory or auditory phonetics), and to abstract linguistic concepts like phones, phrases, or utterances.

=== Phonology ===
{{See|Phonology}}

[[Phonology]] (sometimes called ''phonemics'' or ''phonematics'') is the study of how sounds are used in languages to convey meaning. Phonology includes topics such as [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

The basic unit of analysis for phonology is called [[phoneme]]. A phoneme is a group of sounds which are not distinguished by the language rules in determining the meaning. In English, for example, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[tʰ]}} are different [[allophone]]s that represent a single phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}.

===Morphology===
[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is the study of the internal structure of words. For example, in the sentences ''The dog runs'' and ''The dogs run'', the [[word form]]s ''runs'' and ''dogs'' have an affix ''-s'' added, distinguishing them from the base forms ''dog'' and ''run''. Adding this suffix to a [[noun|nominal]] stem gives plural forms, adding it to [[verb]]al stems restricts the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] to third person singular. Some morphological theories operate with two distinct suffixes ''-s'', called [[allomorph]]s of the [[morpheme]]s Plural and Third person singular, respectively. Languages differ with respect to their morphological structure. Along one axis, we may distinguish [[analytic language]]s, with few or no affixes or other morphological processes from [[synthetic language]]s with many affixes. Along another axis, we may distinguish [[agglutinative language]]s, where affixes express one grammatical property each, and are added neatly one after another, from [[fusional language]]s, with non-concatenative morphological processes ([[infixation]], [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]], [[ablaut]], etc.) and/or with less clear-cut affix boundaries.

===Syntax===
[[Syntax]] is the study of language structure and phrasal hierarchies, depicted in [[parse tree]] format. It is concerned with the relationship between units at the level of words or morphology. Syntax seeks to exactly delineate all and only those sentences which make up a given language, using  native speaker intuition. Syntax seeks to formally describe exactly how structural relations between elements (lexical items/words and operators) in a sentence contribute to its interpretation. Syntax uses principles of formal logic and Set Theory to formalize and accurately represent the hierarchical relationship between elements in a sentence. [[Abstract syntax tree]]s are often used to illustrate the hierarchical structures that are posited. Thus, in active declarative sentences in English the subject is followed by the main verb which in turn is followed by the object (SVO). This order of elements is crucial to its correct interpretation and it is exactly this which syntacticians try to capture. They argue that there must be a formal computational component contained within the language faculty of normal speakers of a language and seek to describe it.

===Semantics===
[[Semantics]] is the study of [[intension]], that is, the intrinsic meanings of words and phrases. Much of the work in the field of [[philosophy of language]] is concerned with the relation between meanings and the word, and this concern cross-cuts formal semantics in several ways. For example, both philosophers of language and semanticists make use of propositional, predicate and modal logics to express their ideas about word meaning.

This article lists a '''Timeline of notable political rivalries''' by country. [[Political parties|Political party]] rivalries are not to be confused with rival family houses within a nation, or warring factions from different nations. This list will not indicate every rival political party within a nation, such as in multiple-party governments. Only the most notable and significant political parties are presented. Rival political alliances may be included as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42162">This is a '''timeline of [[manifold]]s''', one of the major geometric concepts of mathematics. For further background see [[history of manifolds and varieties]].

Manifolds in contemporary mathematics come in a number of types. These include:

* [[Differentiable manifold|smooth]] manifolds, which are basic in [[calculus]] in several variables, [[analysis (mathematics)|mathematical analysis]] and [[differential geometry]];
* [[piecewise linear manifold|piecewise-linear]] manifolds;
* [[topological manifold]]s.

There are also related classes, such as [[homology manifold]]s and [[orbifold]]s, that resemble manifolds. It took a generation for clarity to emerge, after the initial work of [[Henri Poincaré]], on the fundamental definitions; and a further generation to discriminate more exactly between the three major classes. Low-dimensional topology (i.e., dimensions 3 and 4, in practice) turned out to be more resistant than the higher dimension, in clearing up Poincaré's legacy. Further developments brought in fresh geometric ideas, concepts from quantum field theory, and heavy use of category theory.

Participants in the first phase of axiomatisation were influenced by [[David Hilbert]]: with [[Hilbert's axioms]] as exemplary, by [[Hilbert's third problem]] as solved by Dehn, one of the actors, by [[Hilbert's fifteenth problem]] from the needs of 19th century geometry. The subject matter of manifolds is a strand common to [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]] and [[geometric topology]].

The [[maximal atlas]] approach to structures on manifolds had clarified the ''[[Hauptvermutung]]'' for a topological manifold ''M'', as a trichotomy. ''M'' might have no triangulation, hence no piecewise-linear maximal atlas; it might have a unique PL structure; or it might have more than one maximal atlas, and so more than one PL structure. The status of the conjecture, that the second option was always the case, became clarified at this point in the form that each of the three cases might apply, depending on ''M''.

The "combinatorial triangulation conjecture" stated that the first case could not occur, for ''M'' compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ranicki|first1=Andrew A.|editor1-link=Andrew Ranicki|last2=Casson|first2=Andrew J.|author2-link=Andrew Casson|last3=Sullivan|first3=Dennis P.|author3-link=Dennis Sullivan|first4=M.A.|last4=Armstrong|first5= Colin P. |last5=Rourke|author5-link=Colin Rourke|first6= G.E. |last6=Cooke|title=The Hauptvermutung Book: A Collection of Papers on the Topology of Manifolds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jTnpCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=7 July 2018|date=2013-03-09|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401733434|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kirby–Siebenmann result disposed of the conjecture.

{{Literature}}
'''Tragicomedy''' is a [[literary genre]] that blends aspects of both [[tragedy|tragic]] and [[comedy|comic]] forms. Most often seen in [[drama|dramatic literature]], the term can variously describe by either a tragic play which contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewar-Watson|first1=Sarah|author2=Eds. Subha Mukherji and Raphael Lyne|title=''"Aristotle and Tragicomedy."'' Early Modern Tragicomedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gbzzzpd6oCUC|accessdate=26 January 2012|year=2007|publisher=Brewer|isbn=978-1-84384-130-2|pages=15–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In theatre ==
===Classical precedent===
[[Image:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tragic Comic masks of [[Ancient Greek theatre]] represented in the [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic.]]

There is no complete formal definition of tragicomedy from the [[classical antiquity|classical]] age.  It appears that the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had something like the Renaissance meaning of the term (that is, a serious action with a happy ending) in mind when, in ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', he discusses tragedy with a dual ending.&lt;ref&gt;Poetics: XIII, End of 2nd paragraph, Trans: Bywater, Ingram, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, a number of [[Ancient Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[theatre of ancient Rome|Roman plays]], for instance ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', may be called tragicomedies, though without any definite attributes outside of plot.  The word itself originates with the Roman comic playwright [[Plautus]], who coined the term somewhat facetiously in the prologue to his play ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]''.  The character Mercury, sensing the indecorum of the inclusion of both kings and gods alongside servants in a comedy, declares that the play had better be a "tragicomoedia":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Verna A.|title=The Name and Nature of Tragicomedy|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|isbn=0-7546-3567-8|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|I will make it a mixture: let it be a tragicomedy.

===Renaissance revivals===
====Italy====
Plautus's comment had an arguably excessive impact on [[Renaissance]] aesthetic theory, which had largely transformed Aristotle's comments on drama into a rigid theory.  For "rule mongers" (the term is [[Giordano Bruno]]'s), "mixed" works such as those mentioned above, more recent "romances" such as ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', and even ''[[The Odyssey]]'' were at best puzzles; at worst, mistakes.  Two figures helped to elevate tragicomedy to the status of a regular genre, by which is meant one with its own set of rigid rules. [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]] Cinthio, in the mid-sixteenth century, both argued that the tragedy-with-comic-ending (''tragedia de lieto fin'') was most appropriate to modern times and produced his own examples of such plays.  Even more important was [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]].  Guarini's ''[[Il Pastor Fido]]'', published in 1590, provoked a fierce critical debate in which Guarini's spirited defense of generic innovation eventually carried the day.  Guarini's tragicomedy offered modulated action that never drifted too far either to comedy or tragedy, mannered characters, and a pastoral setting.  All three became staples of continental tragicomedy for a century and more.

====England====
In England, where practice ran ahead of theory, the situation was quite different.  In the sixteenth century, "tragicomedy" meant the native sort of romantic play that violated the unities of time, place, and action, that glibly mixed high- and low-born characters, and that presented fantastic actions.  These were the features [[Philip Sidney]] deplored in his complaint against the "mungrell Tragy-comedie" of the 1580s, and of which Shakespeare's Polonius offers famous testimony: "The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individuable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men." Some aspects of this romantic impulse remain even in the work of more sophisticated playwrights: [[Shakespeare]]'s last plays, which may well be called tragicomedies, have often been called romances.

By the early Stuart period, some English playwrights had absorbed the lessons of the Guarini controversy. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''The Faithful Shepherdess'', an adaptation of Guarini's play, was produced in 1608.  In the printed edition, Fletcher offered an interesting definition of the term, worth quoting at length: "A tragi-comedie is not so called in respect of mirth and killing, but in respect it wants deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy, yet brings some neere it, which is inough to make it no comedie."  Fletcher's definition focuses primarily on events: a play's genre is determined by whether or not people die in it, and in a secondary way on how close the action comes to a death.  But, as Eugene Waith showed, the tragicomedy Fletcher developed in the next decade also had unifying stylistic features: sudden and unexpected revelations, outré plots, distant locales, and a persistent focus on elaborate, artificial rhetoric.

Some of Fletcher's contemporaries, notably [[Philip Massinger]] and [[James Shirley]], wrote successful and popular tragicomedies. [[Richard Brome]] also essayed the form, but with less success. And many of their contemporary writers, ranging from [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] to [[Lodowick Carlell]] to Sir [[Aston Cockayne]], made attempts in the genre.

Tragicomedy remained fairly popular up to the closing of the theaters in 1642, and Fletcher's works were popular in the Restoration as well.  The old styles were cast aside as tastes changed in the eighteenth century; the "tragedy with a happy ending" eventually developed into [[melodrama]], in which form it still flourishes.

====Later developments====
The more subtle criticism that developed after the Renaissance stressed the thematic and formal aspects of tragicomedy, rather than plot. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] defined it as a mixture of emotions in which "seriousness stimulates laughter, and pain pleasure."  Even more commonly, tragicomedy's affinity with satire and "dark" comedy have suggested a tragicomic impulse in modern theatre with Luigi Pirandello who influenced Beckett.  Also it can be seen in [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] drama. [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], the Swiss dramatist, suggested that tragicomedy was the inevitable genre for the twentieth century; he describes his play ''[[The Visit (play)|The Visit]]'' (1956) as a tragicomedy.  Tragicomedy is a common genre in post-[[World War II]] [[United Kingdom|British]] theatre, with authors as varied as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[John Arden]], [[Alan Ayckbourn]] and [[Harold Pinter]] writing in this genre. Many writers of the [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] and [[postmodernist]] movements have made use of tragicomedy and/or [[gallows humor]]. A notable example of a [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] tragicomedy is [[David Foster Wallace]]'s 1996 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[Infinite Jest]]''.

The [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] is a subdivision of the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] that adjudicates petitions and processes forms related to citizenship, residency, and various kinds of authorization to live and work in the United States. Many of the forms it processes are prerequisites for people outside the United States who are not United States citizens or permanent residents to obtaining visas to enter the United States in the specified status. Many of the [[USCIS immigration forms]] have long processing times. The USCIS offers some guidance regarding expected processing times through its website and through reports.&lt;ref name=uscis-official&gt;{{cite web|url = https://egov.uscis.gov/cris/processTimesDisplayInit.do|title =  USCIS Processing Time Information|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This page describes the USCIS policies, the guidance they offer, and the courses of action in case of higher processing times.

Note that these processing times do not include the processing times for [[U.S. Department of Labor]] forms (such as [[Labor Condition Application]] and [[labor certification]]) that are prerequisites for some USCIS petitions and forms, nor do they include the [[National Visa Center]] wait times for immigrant visa numbers, the wait time for getting visas from a U.S. consulate abroad, or border wait times.

== Various kinds of USCIS processing ==

The USCIS offers processing time information for many different kinds of processing:&lt;ref name=uscis-official/&gt;&lt;ref name=aila-processing-times&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aila.org/infonet/processing-time-reports|title = Processing Time Reports|publisher = [[American Immigration Lawyers Association]]|accessdate = January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Processing forms (applications and petitions) at its Service Centers: There are four service centers: [[California]] Service Center, [[Nebraska]] Service Center, [[Vermont]] Service Center, and [[Texas]] Service Center. All USCIS immigration forms (but not the naturalization forms) go through Service Centers.&lt;ref name=uscis-official/&gt;
* Field Office processing: This is the final stage of processing for some forms that also require in-person interviews. These include [[Form I-485]], [[Form N-400]] and [[Form N-600]]. Note that when Form I-485 is filed concurrently with Form I-130, then the Form I-130 is first processed at the Service Center and then the Form I-485 is processed at the field office. The total wait time is the sum of the wait times for both forms.&lt;ref name=uscis-official/&gt;
* [[National Benefits Center]] processing: Some USCIS immigration forms go through the NBC. These are Forms I-102, I-131, I-600, I-601A, I-765, I-817, I-824, and I-90.&lt;ref name=uscis-official/&gt;
* Immigrant Investor Program Office processing: This Office processes Form I-526 petitions whose approval allows one to obtain an EB-5 visa).&lt;ref name=uscis-official/&gt;
* International Operations Offices processing: International Operations offices are used for [[Direct Consular Filing]] for some forms, notably [[Form I-130|I-130]] (most international offices), Form I-360, and Form I-730 (available only in some offices).&lt;ref name=uscis-official/&gt;
* [[Administrative Appeals Office]] processing: This includes processing for appeals to USCIS decisions for most USCIS forms, with the exception of [[Form I-130]] and Form I-360.&lt;ref name=aao-processing-times&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/directorates-and-program-offices/administrative-appeals-office-aao/aao-processing-times|title = AAO Processing Times|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The USCIS processing queue ==

Each form or petition the USCIS receives is put in a [[First-come, first-served|queue]] for processing once it is received by the part of the USCIS (typically a service center or field office) that will process it. The queue that a form is put in depends on two aspects:&lt;ref name=uscis-official/&gt;

* The service center or field office where the form is being processed.
* The type of form (note that the form number alone does not determine the queue, because there may be many categories that use the same form number; for instance, [[Form I-129]] is used for many different kinds of temporary work authorization, and each of them has a separate queue). Note that after initial review, if the form is awaiting a response from the applicant (to a [[Request For Evidence]], [[Notice of Intent to Deny]], or request for clarification), the application is placed in "active suspense" and is not part of the queue.

The queue operates in a standard [[first in, first out]] fashion: a form that is put in the queue at a later date will start being reviewed or adjudicated at a later date (there is an exception for those who use the [[Premium Processing Service]] discussed later, that can be used for [[Form I-129]] and [[Form I-140]]).

The time between the date of receipt of the form by the service center or field office and the date it is reviewed is called the "processing time" of the form. Due to the way the queue operates, the processing times for forms processed close by in time will be similar. Therefore, to estimate processing times for forms that are currently being reviewed, it suffices to know the date of receipt.

=== Processing time goals and backlogs ===

For each form, USCIS has a processing time goal.&lt;ref name=uscis-official/&gt; These  processing time goals are set by the USCIS Office of Performance and Quality (OPQ)&lt;ref name=telecon/&gt; that was established in January 2010.

If the processing time at a given time for a particular service center and form is significantly higher than the processing time goal, USCIS may either increase allocation of resources within the Service Center to process that form, or (in some extreme cases) reallocate some of the caseload to a different service center.

Typical reasons for increased backlog include significant additional demands on USCIS resources due to the introduction of new categories of forms or an increase in usage of existing forms. For instance, in the aftermath of [[Barack Obama]]'s executive action on [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] in June 2012, the USCIS faced increased workloads, and this was one of the factors in significantly increased wait times for [[Form I-130]] petitions.&lt;ref name=lawandborder-processing-times/&gt;

=== Courses of action for delayed processing ===

For [[Form I-765]] applications for an [[employment authorization document]], there is a promised 90-day processing time. If a Form I-765 application is close to or beyond the 90-day processing timeframe, the applicant may take the following actions:&lt;ref name=telecon/&gt;

* Contact the USCIS [[National Customer Service Center]]
* Submit a case inquiry using DHS Form 7001 to the Ombudsman's Office

For Forms I-129 and I-140, the petitioner may use the [[Premium Processing Service]] to get an initial review within 15 calendar days. The petitioner can obtain the Premium Processing Service for an already submitted application and can in fact obtain it electronically. The 15 calendar day clock begins from the time the petitioner's Premium Processing Service application is received by the USCIS.

In general, if a petition or application has not received a response even though the USCIS is showing a later date of applications currently being processed, the petitioner or applicant can raise the issue with the USCIS National Customer Service Center.

== Reporting of processing times ==

On the 15th of every month, the USCIS publishes information, for each of its processing queues (i.e., for every combination of service center/field office/other subdivision and form type) the processing time as observed 45 days ago. For instance, on January 15, 2016, the USCIS published this information for forms being processed as of November 30, 2015. The 45-day gap is to allow the USCIS to verify the data for quality.&lt;ref name=uscis-official/&gt;&lt;ref name=aila-processing-times/&gt;&lt;ref name=telecon&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.dhs.gov/telecon-recap-application-processing-times-conversation-uscis-office-performance-and-quality|title = Telecon Recap: Application Processing Times: A Conversation with USCIS Office of Performance and Quality|accessdate = January 24, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the 45-day delay in reporting, the information published by USCIS may not be very helpful to applicants for some forms whose processing times fluctuate wildly.&lt;ref name=telecon/&gt;

The USCIS reports processing times in two formats. For the categories where the USCIS is meeting its processing time goal, it simply reports the processing time goal in months. For other forms, the USCIS reports the average date of receipt for the forms being processed on the date the processing times were observed. For instance, in the data released on January 15, the USCIS reported the dates of forms being processed (for each combination of service center/field office/other subdivision and form category) as of November 30.&lt;ref name=uscis-official/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawandborder-processing-times&gt;{{cite web|url = http://lawandborder.com/abysmal-uscis-processing-times-130-immediate-relative-immigrant-petitions/|title = USCIS Processing Times for Immediate Relative I-130s Improving|last = Chodorow|first = Gary|date = May 3, 2014|accessdate = January 17, 2016|publisher = Law and Border}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few other caveats need to be noted when interpreting reported processing times:

* '''Initial review only; excludes active suspense''': While all forms being processed for initial review are processed in the order in which they were received, forms that are re-processed after receiving a response to a [[Request For Evidence]], [[Notice of Intent to Deny]], or a request for clarification from the applicant may not bear a relationship with the date of receipt of the original form. Forms that are awaiting a response from the applicant are said to be in "active suspense". When reporting processing times, the USCIS removes data on forms in active suspense. This is part of the quality control done by the USCIS and is one of the reasons for the 45-day delay in reporting.&lt;ref name=telecon/&gt;
* '''Data skewed by Premium Processing''': The USCIS does not separate out data for petitions that have requested the [[Premium Processing Service]], i.e., its estimate of processing time includes both petitions that have requested Premium Processing and those that have not. While this does not affect form categories ineligible for Premium Processing, it does skew the reported processing times for the forms eligible for Premium Processing. For instance, a [[Form I-129]] petition that did ''not'' have a Premium Processing Service request will likely take ''more'' time to process than the processing time reported by the USCIS.&lt;ref name=telecon/&gt;
* '''Guidelines for processing times for petitions after they receive a response to a RFE or NOID''': There are no general processing times reported for petitions after they receive a response to a RFE or NOID, since it varies from case to case, and it is best to communicate directly with the Service Center.

== Additional statistics ==

The USCIS also publishes quarterly reports (i.e., once every three months) for each form giving detailed statistics (by field office/service center location) of the number of applications received, accepted, denied, and pending.&lt;ref name=uscis-statistics&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-studies/immigration-forms-data|title = Immigration and Citizenship Data|accessdate = January 24, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premium Processing Service ==

{{further|Premium Processing Service}}

The USCIS offers a [[Premium Processing Service]] at an additional fee of $1225 for [[Form I-129]] (non-immigrant worker) and [[Form I-140]] (immigrant worker) petitions. The Premium Processing Service has a fee of $1225 and promises an initial review from the USCIS within 15 calendar days of receipt of the form, after which time it may approve, deny, or issue a [[Request For Evidence]] or [[Notice of Intent to Deny]].&lt;ref name=uscis-premium-processing/&gt; For the special case of cap-subject [[H-1B visa]]s where the applications are concentrated in the beginning of April, the start date for the 15-day countdown is generally delayed due to the huge influx of applications.&lt;ref name=uscis-premium-processing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/forms/how-do-i-use-premium-processing-service|title = How Do I Use the Premium Processing Service?|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Premium Processing Service was introduced in 2001 for Form I-129&lt;ref name=endelman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilw.com/articles/2001,0612-Endelman.shtm|title = Be Careful of What You Wish For: The Hidden Meaning of Premium Processing Fees|last = Endelman|first = Gary|publisher = [[Immigration Daily]]|date = June 12, 2001|accessdate = April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended to Form I-140 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.visaserve.com/Articles/New-Premium-Process-Rules-are-in-Effect.pdf|title = New Premium Processing Rules are in Effect|date = May 23, 2006|accessdate = April 5, 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121014195427/http://www.visaserve.com/Articles/New-Premium-Process-Rules-are-in-Effect.pdf|archivedate = October 14, 2012|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USCIS has been asked to extend the Premium Processing Service to Form I-526 (for EB-5 investors) and has also formulated proposals to do so, but as of January 2016, still uses the Premium Processing Service only for Forms I-129 and I-140.&lt;ref name=eb5-expediting&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eb5investors.com/blog/Expediting-an-EB-5-Application|title = Expediting an EB-5 Application|last= Kalmykov|first = Kate|date = August 28, 2012|accessdate = April 5, 2015|publisher = Greenberg Traurig LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb5-premium-processing-forum-question&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eb5investors.com/qa/premium-processing-alternative-available-through-uscis-for-eb5|title = Is there a premium processing alternative available through the USCIS for EB5 regional center applications?|accessdate = April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''World Tales''''', subtitled "'''The Extraordinary Coincidence of Stories Told in All Times, in All Places'''" is a book of 65 [[Fairy tale|folk tales]] collected by [[Idries Shah]] from around the world, mostly from literary sources. Some of the tales are very current, others are less well known.

==Content==
Each story is preceded by a short introduction by the author, giving a brief history of the tale's literary mutations, or remarking on the strange similarities that versions exhibit across great geographical or historical distances.&lt;ref&gt;For example, asking, with reference to the story of [[Childe Rowland]]: "How can it be that the same story is found in Scotland and also in pre-Columbian America?"&lt;/ref&gt; The collection has had a broad appeal. For instance Canadian poet [[P. K. Page]] cited it as the book she would give to a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/writersandcompany/98readings.html|title=Home - Writers &amp; Company with Eleanor Wachtel - CBC Radio|date=12 January 2016|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author and storyteller [[Norah Dooley]]:&lt;ref name="NorahDolley"&gt;{{cite web

Whilst Shah mentions many of the ancient and modern interpretations that have been placed on the tales, along with some of the theories of [[Fairy tale#Cross-cultural transmission|cross-cultural transmission]], he himself interprets them little, writing in the introduction: 
{{cquote| Working for thirty-five years among the written and oral sources of our world heritage in tales, one feels a truly living element in them which is startlingly evident when one isolates the 'basic' stories: the ones which tend to have travelled furthest, to have featured in the largest number of classical collections, to have inspired great writers of the past and present.}} 
The value that Shah put on folklore of this kind is clear, not only from the many volumes of tales that he published but also from books published by his children. The title alone of one of his daughter [[Saira Shah]]'s books, ''The Storyteller's Daughter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Shah
  | first = Saira
  | title = The Storyteller's Daughter
  | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd
  | year = 2004
  | isbn =  0-14-101026-6 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; gives some indication, while his son [[Tahir Shah]]'s book ''[[In Arabian Nights]]'', itself an exploration of the power of the folktale, recalls:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|When my father died a decade ago, I inherited his library. There were five reinforced boxes of books labeled "STORIES: VALUABLE, HANDLE WITH CARE". Among them were [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's ''Fables'']], [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and the [[Brothers Grimm]]. There were many others too, the Arab collections and volumes of tales from every corner of the world... }}

&lt;/ref&gt; with each tale illustrated. Originally Shah asked [[Ivan Tyrrell]] to find illustrations for the tales by the likes of [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Kay Nielsen]] and [[Edmund Dulac]]. Tyrrell instead suggested commissioning new work, Shah agreed to this and the idea was put to, and approved by, the publisher, [[William Jovanovich]].&lt;ref name="listening"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tyrrell|first1=Ivan|title=Listening to Idries Shah|date=2016|publisher=Human Givens Publishing|isbn=978-1899398089|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty seven artists&lt;ref&gt;David Aicken, Wayne Anderson, Philip Argent, [[Peter Brookes]], Fred Carver, Doranna, Roy Ellsworth, Brian Froud, Tim Gill, Peter Goodfellow, Melvyn Grant, Lynda Gray, Colin Hadley, Ivan Hissey, Ken Laidlaw, Roger Langton, Carol Lawson, Janina Lech, [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], James Marsh, Chris McEwan, Tony Meeuwissen, Martin Newton, David O'Connor, Joe Petagno, Sue Porter, Peter Richardson, Carolyn Scrace, Caroline Smith, Mike Terry, [[Alan Tunbridge]], [[Ivan Tyrrell]], George Underwood, Malcolm Walker, Mai Watts, Juan Wijngaard and Ray Winder&lt;/ref&gt; contributed. This edition is no longer in print; the [[Octagon Press]] edition is text only.

Agnes Perkins, writing in the ''[[Children's Literature Association Quarterly]]'' cited this "lavish" edition of ''World Tales'' as an example of books that bridge the gap between illustrated books of folktales published for the juvenile market which pay little attention to sources or to authenticity of tone and language and which supply none of the working tools developed for folklore scholarship which might lead readers to further study of tales from the oral tradition, and collections by folklorists concerned primarily with local variants and the unusual persistence of motifs which ignore questions of the value of the stories from a literary standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Agnes Perkins|year= 1981|title= Folklore and Children's Books: Bridging the Gap|journal= [[Children's Literature Association Quarterly]]  |volume= 6|issue= 2|pages= 1–37 |doi=10.1353/chq.0.1667}}&lt;/ref&gt;
