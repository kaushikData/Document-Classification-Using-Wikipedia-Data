'''Al-Hidayah''' (meaning "The Guidance") was founded in 2004 as a UK-based youth-oriented forum of [[Minhaj-ul-Quran UK]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-hidayah.co.uk Al Hidayah]&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Hidayah has been held as an annual 3 day residential retreat held at various locations in the [[United Kingdom]] under the spiritual guidance of [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]].

Al-Hidayah 2018 was held between the dates of 17–19 August 2018 at [https://www.hoteldoorwerth.nl/en/ Fletcher Hotel Doorwerth-Arnhem] in [[Arnhem]] under the spiritual guidance of [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam, Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]]. More information can be found by visiting [https://alhidayah.nl/ alhidayah.nl]

== Al-Hidayah 2005 (Pioneer Centre, Shropshire) ==
In 2005, [[Minhaj-ul-Quran UK]] began 'Al-Hidayah', a series of annual 3 day residential educational and spiritual retreats, targeted at British Muslims, and inviting the foremost Islamic scholars from around the world.

Al-Hidayah 2005 was held in the picturesque surroundings of the Pioneer Centre, [[Shropshire]] under the spiritual guidance of his imminence [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]] head of Minhaj ul Quran International.

Over 300 young Muslims attended the 3 day event and due to its success the residential retreat has been held as an annual event. The aims and objectives of Al Hidayah were to provide British youth with true knowledge of Islamic teachings based on love, peace and humanity. 

== Al-Hidayah 2006 (Heythrop Park, Oxfordshire) ==
Al-Hidayah 2006, was held between Friday 25 August to Monday 28 August 2006 in [[Heythrop Park]], [[Oxfordshire]]. The main speaker at the event was [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]]. The event was also attended by Shaykh [[Asad Muhammad Saeed as-Sagharji]], who was a great scholar from the Islamic world.

The main feature of the event was the keynote speech of Shaykh-ul-Islam on the Life and Travels of Imam Bukhari. The organisers attracted more than 600 participants from [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]] and as far as the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/5285924.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} UK {{!}} England {{!}} Oxfordshire {{!}} Meeting to combat radical Islam|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Al-Hidayah 2007 (Heythrop Park, Oxfordshire) ==
The third annual Al-Hidayah Residential Spiritual and Educational Retreat took place at the same venue as the 2006 event, in Heythrop Park Oxfordshire.

Hundreds of participants from all over the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]] came to benefit from the one in a lifetime opportunity of spending four days in the company of [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]].

The previous two retreats were life changing for the young participants who were blessed with the opportunity of elevating their spirituality and to purify their inner-selves from lusts of the material world, to be replaced by a longing for the Creator.

Alongside being a Mufassir, Muhadith and Faqih; among a long list of responsibilities that Shaykh-ul-Islam has taken upon himself in order to carry out his work for the Ummah, he is also one of the greatest Sufi leaders of the time. He is the ultimate all-in-one entity perfectly qualified to meet all the needs of those who want to escape from the clutches of materialism. Knowledge alone is not sufficient for this, thus a mere scholar is unable to bring about these changes in his followers. It is only when oceans of knowledge merge with galaxies of spiritualism, does a person qualify to carry out such a task.

The venue selected by the Al-Hidayah organisers was the perfect environment for both gaining knowledge and also experiencing spiritual uplift. The peaceful and green surroundings together with the spiritual teachings and company'' ''of Shaykh-ul-Islam made the venue a practical fountain of Tazkiyyah, Ihsan and Tasawwuf. The venue also catered for all the needs of the participants including accommodating the needs of families with children, separate facilities for brothers and sisters such as gym, swimming pool, sports activities, excellent dining facilities and accommodation and much more.

Shaykh [[Asad Muhammad Saeed as-Sagharji]], [[Damascus]] [[Syria]], was the chief guest. Shaykh Abdurahman al-Hammami and Sayyid Muadh were also special guests from Syria. Shaykh [[Abdul-Hakim Murad]] ([[University of Cambridge]]), a renowned British scholar was a guest speaker.

== Al-Hidayah 2009 (University of Warwick) ==
[[Minhaj-ul-Quran UK]] organised a three-day annual "Al-Hidayah Youth Camp" at the [[University of Warwick]] in August 2009, which was attended by more than 1200 participants, from across the world. The participants started arriving at 9am on 8 August 2009. After the computerised verification of all delegates, they were issued passes. Renowned Syrian scholar, Shaykh [[Asad Muhammad Saeed as-Sagharji]], delivered the first lecture to the participants on the subject of "Discipline &amp; Morality". Shaykh [[Abdul-Hakim Murad]] Murad of [[University of Cambridge]], another British scholar of immense erudition, delivered his talk on the importance of relations with other religions in a non-Muslim society.

The proceedings of the first day were punctuated with the occasional recitation from the Quran and presentation of [[Nasheed]] to keep the participants spiritually energised. In addition to Shaykh Abdur Rahman and his companions, the "Qawals" of Hassan Minhaj Naat Council kept the audience spiritually ecstatic with their presentations in Arabic, Urdu and Punjabi languages. [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]] was given a standing ovation and huge round of applause upon his arrival in the hall as chief organiser Dr Zahid Iqbal, welcomed Shaykh-ul-Islam and invited him to deliver his keynote speech.

Shaykh-ul-Islam made "Peace &amp; Unity" the subject of his address. Former minister of [[Egypt]], Prof Yahya Jamal, attended the camp on the first day and delivered a special lecture. The pictorial exhibition of renowned British photographer, Peter Sanders, who embraced Islam in 1991, was also the focus of people's attention. His pictures highlighted religious, social and sociological behaviours and trends in different societies. The participants liked the exhibition very much.

Dr Raheeq Ahmad Abbasi, Secretary General of [[Minhaj-ul-Quran]], gave comprehensive briefing to the participants about the organisations worldwide network. The office bearers of [[Minhaj Welfare Foundation]] also gave briefing about their activities whose chief highlight was the ongoing project of ‘Aagosh’ (Orphan Care Home), which is estimated to cost 34 million rupees. The briefing also included details of [[Minhaj Welfare Foundation]] activities in other areas etc.

The highlight of the camp was the question &amp; answer session. The panel, which asked questions, included Canon Dr Christopher Lamb, representative of Archbishop of Canterbury Dr [[Rowan Williams]], Professor Ron Geaves, Professor of the Comparative Study of Religion, [[Liverpool Hope University]], Dr Sophie Gilliat-Ray, Director, Centre for the Study of Islam in the UK, [[Cardiff University]], Dr Tahir Abbas, Director of the Centre for the Study of Ethnicity and Culture, [[University of Birmingham]], Phil Rees, prominent journalist and producer, Maqsood Ahmed, Senior Advisor from Communities Ministry and Zahoor Niazi, Chief-Editor of [[Jang News]] London, Peter Sanders, prominent photographer. The thrust of every question revolved around the issue of terrorism, extremism and practical steps that could be taken to save the Muslim Youth from these scourges. The participants gave cheering applause and kept clapping in response to the answers given to these questions by Shaykh-ul-Islam, which speaks volumes of the satisfaction they must have derived from this informed discourse.

Shaykh-ul-Islam reminded the youth attending the camp that they should not allow their love and association with the worldly life to exceed a particular limit. Rather they should focus on their morality, character and values so that they could not feel embarrassed in front of Prophet Muhammad on the Day of Judgement. He urged the youth to start implementing the teachings of Islam and following Prophet Muhammad ideal life for both material and spiritual success.

Denouncing extremism and terrorism, Shaykh-ul-Islam said that peace was the main message of Islam. He threw light on the difference between Jihad and Terrorism, saying that Prophet Muhammad prescribed guidelines to be followed during war etc. The Muslims were prohibited from bringing any harm to non-combatants such as children, women, old people, and destroying orchards, animals and buildings of the enemy etc. "Whatever is being perpetrated in the name of religion is complete negation of what Islam stands for and it is clear violation of Islamic teachings," Shaykh-ul-Islam said while referring to Islamic history.

Shaykh-ul-Islam instructed the youth to devote themselves fully to obtaining an education and said that it is by playing positive role and making positive contribution to their respective societies that they can increase the esteem of their country and religion. He said that ideal character of forefathers was responsible for the spread of Islam around the globe, not the sword.

Shaykh-ul-Islam said that [[Minhaj-ul-Quran]] was promoting the real message of Islam through its network by engaging other religions and communities in constructive dialogue for better tomorrow. He urged the youth to stand up to the extremists and terrorist who were out to malign Islam through their practices in collaboration with their communities and government institutions. "This is through joint action and understanding that we can eliminate extremism and terrorism," he held.

The three-day camp concluded on the determination to work collectively to spread awareness about Islamic teachings and defeat terrorists at intellectual levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-41657420090810?sp=true|title='Muslim Camp' draws UK teens to combat extremism|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=Reuters India|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Al-Hidayah 2010 (University of Warwick) ==
Al-Hidayah 2010 was held at The [[University of Warwick]] between 7 August and 9 August 2010 under the spiritual guidance of [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]]. Al Hidayah held in 2010 was of great significance as it was the year Shaykh-ul-Islam released the world famous work titled [[Fatwa on Terrorism]] which is an Islamic edict condemning all forms of terrorism in the world.

At the opening press conference [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]] shed light on the aims and objectives of the camp and emphasised on the reasons why he believes it is necessary to train the youth to tackle extremist ideologies. He said that this 3-day initiative is aimed at awakening the Muslim youth to challenge the arguments of the extremist and to promote the need of collective action for promotion of peace, interfaith dialogue, and harmony and addressing the misunderstandings and confusions the concepts of jihad, khilafah and democracy. Analysing the emergence of terrorism, he said that cancer of terrorism does not emerge from nowhere but it begins as an ‘ideological infection’ which is a narrow interpretation and vision of Islam. It is misinterpretation of the Quran, Hadith and classical authorities of Islam. He said this process begins in mosques, schools, Universities, and through the internet by extremist groups. They initially start persuading their argument which leads towards brainwashing. He said that "terrorism is a cancer that begins from and an ideological infection."

Shaykh-ul-Islam said that following the publication of [[Fatwa on Terrorism]], it put a stop to its practice of stereotyping the Muslims and conveyed the Islamic message of tolerance, harmony and interfaith dialogue to a wide range of people and regions. This step dealt a lethal blow to the extremists and encouraged the reformers.

The event attracted over 1200 youngsters from all over [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/anti-terrorism-summer-camp-held-in-britain-100649109/170175.html|title=Anti-Terrorism Summer Camp Held In Britain|last=Ridgwell|first=Henry|access-date=2017-02-05|language=en|newspaper=VOA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10900478|title=Muslim group Minhaj ul-Quran runs 'anti-terrorism' camp|last=Casciani|first=Dominic|date=2010-08-07|access-date=2017-02-05|language=en-GB|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peace for Humanity Conference 2011 (Wembley Arena) ==
‘Peace for Humanity’ Conference was held on 24 September 2011 at the [[Wembley Arena]] under the banner of [[Minhaj-ul-Quran UK]]. [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]] presided over the Conference attended by 12,000 people, which was also attended by human rights and peace activists, religious scholars, opinion leaders and key leaders and followers of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism.

In his address, Shaykh-ul-Islam said that the world needed peace, security and brotherhood more than before. He said that after 9/11, the difficulties of the Muslims around the globe have increased manifold. The picture of Islam spread in the world has nothing to do with Islam and 99% of Muslims are peace-loving. He said that terrorism and extremism had affected the Muslims more than the world. He said that thousands of people were killed in terrorist incidents, affecting millions of families. Extremism, he said, divided people and produced pessimism and despondency. He congratulated MQI UK on holding such a grand and purposeful Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15044797|title=Muslim peace conference condemns terrorism|date=2011-09-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Al-Hidayah 2016 (Keele University, Staffordshire) ==
[[Minhaj-ul-Quran UK]] Al-Hidayah project team arranged Al-Hidayah 2016 with a relevant and much needed focus on developing future leadership. This year’s event was the first three day event since Al-Hidayah 2010, and the objectives of the event were geared towards nurturing and inspiring future leaders from amongst the youth.

[[Keele University]] in [[Staffordshire]], was chosen as the venue for the event, set in 600 acres of scenic greenery and with all accommodation, facilities and events on campus, it provided the ideal environment for three days of learning and development.

It is also worthy of note that this was Minhaj-ul-Qur’an International’s first three day residential event of this size organised anywhere in the world outside of [[Pakistan]], without the direct participation of the founder of Minhaj-ul-Qur’an International, his eminence [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]]. However, the event was presided over by the main keynote speaker Shaykh Dr. Hussain Mohi-ud-Din Qadri (President of the Minhaj Education Society), eloquently and with an ideal blend of knowledge, inspiration and motivation.

== Regional Events 2017 ==
In preparation for Al-Hidayah 2017 to be held at [[Keele University]] in [[Staffordshire]] between 26 August and 28 August, the Al-Hidayah team organised Al-Hidayah regional events in the cities of [[Glasgow]], [[Luton]], [[Walsall]] and [[Manchester]]. The events emphasised the importance of the work of [[Minhaj-ul-Quran]] in our times and how youngsters can participate in propagating the works of [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]].

==Al-Hidayah 2017 (Keele University, Staffordshire)==

==Early life==
She was born in 1880 in New York City, the daughter of Rebecca (Goldsmith) and Joseph Frankau, an actor. Joseph was a cousin of London cigar importer [[Arthur Frankau]] and thus, by marriage, of novelist and art historian [[Julia Frankau|Frank Danby]], whom Aline recalled visiting as a child when Joseph Frankau was performing in London.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Aline (1941) ''An Actor's Daughter'', A. A. Knopf – Ch. 7 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Her family was Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/bernstein-aline&lt;/ref&gt; By the time she was 17, both of her parents had died and she was raised by her aunt, Rachel Goldsmith. Goldsmith had a theatrical boarding house on West 44th Street in New York City.

==Career==
[[File:Wish-To-Be-Alone-Grand-Hotel-1930.jpg|thumb|One of Bernstein's set designs for the original Broadway production of ''Grand Hotel'' (1930)]]
[[File:The-Children's-Hour-1935-1.jpg|thumb|Bernstein's setting for the original Broadway production of ''[[The Children's Hour (play)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1934)]]
Between 1916 and 1951, Bernstein would do set design, costuming, or both for 51 productions.&lt;ref name ="IBDB"/&gt;

Bernstein was a theater set and costume designer for the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] on the Lower East Side, volunteering her work to make her name.

In 1926 she struggled but prevailed in becoming the first female member of the designers union. This membership opened up opportunities for Broadway commissions. However, as a woman, she still found that it was much easier to find work as a costume designer rather than as a set designer.&lt;ref name="Essin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Essin|first1=Christin|title=Stage Designers in Early Twentieth-Century America: Artists, Activists, Cultural Critics|date=2012|publisher=Publshr|location=Loc|page=43| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0M-cNuICBMoC&amp;pgn=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her career ran in phases; early on, she focused largely on costume design. After about 14 years of work, in 1930, she was able to move into set design. For about a decade, she primarily did set design work, only to return to costume design again around 1940 for the final phase of her career.&lt;ref name ="IBDB"/&gt;

In the 1930s she also began to write, with two books published by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], a highly respected publisher at that time.&lt;ref name="Essin" /&gt; She was personal friends with [[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.|Arthur]] and [[Blanche Knopf]].&lt;ref name="marshall 229"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mauldin |first=Joanne Marshall |year=2007 |title=Thomas Wolfe: When Do the Atrocities Begin? |publisher=University of Tennessee Press |isbn=1-57233-494-0 |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first book, ''Three Blue Suits'', helped to more firmly establish her as a designer in New York. The book included a series of three stories in which three very different men wear the same blue serge suit. The details regarding how each man wears – or drags (the jacket on the floor) – his suit, reveal aspects of each man's character in subtle ways. A common trope among costume designer is that costumes, if they are good, should ultimately not be noticed. In contrast, the blue suit stories reveal Bernstein's ability to discern how critical details of costume evoke, and interact with, a character, and ultimately her skill as a costume designer at making this happen effectively.&lt;ref name= "Essin" /&gt;

Some of her publications include:
* "Three Blue Suits" (collection of short stories), 1933
* ''The Journey Down'' (over her relationship with Wolfe), Knopf, 1938
* ''Miss Condon'', Knopf, 1947
* ''An Actor's Daughter'' (memoir), 1940
* ''The Martha Washington Doll Book'', 1945
* ''Masterpieces of Women's Costume of the 18th and 19th Centuries'', 1959 (published posthumously)

In 1950, Aline Bernstein finally won some hard earned recognition. In 1949 she had designed costumes for the [[opera]] ''Regina''. The music and [[libretto]] were written [[Marc Blitzstein]] but based on the play ''[[The Little Foxes]]'' by [[Lillian Hellman]], a play for which Bernstein had previously designed costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grout|first =Donald Jay|authorlink = Donald Jay Grout|author2=Hermine Weigel Williams|title=A Short History of Opera|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2003|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11958-5|page=742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBDB" /&gt; Although that production of ''Regina'' (it would be regularly revived in the 20th century) only ran for a month and a half, Bernstein won a [[Tony Award|Tony]] for her costume design in 1950.&lt;ref name="IBDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aline Bernstein|url=http://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/Aline-Bernstein-24670|website=Internet Broadway Database|publisher=The Broadway League, Inc.|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfe immortalized Bernstein as the character Esther Jack in his novels ''[[Of Time and the River]]'', ''[[The Web and the Rock]]'', and ''[[You Can't Go Home Again]]''. Bernstein, in turn, centered her autobiographical novel ''The Journey Down'' around her affair with Wolfe.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Bernstein's and Wolfe's affair ended after a few years, but their friendship continued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2722">In [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[mythology]] an '''aloja''' ({{IPA-ca|əˈlɔʒə}}; plural ''aloges''), also known as '''dona d'aigua''', '''goja''' or '''paitida''', is a [[Femininity|feminine]] being that lives in places with [[fresh water]]. These "water-women" are said to be able to turn into water [[common blackbird|blackbird]]s.

==Legend==
According to legend, these women are not [[immortality|immortal]], but can live for thousands of years and retain their youth.

It is said that the lakes where the ''dones d'aigua'' [[Bathing|bathe]] can boil in anger if any stranger enters them. In [[Majorca]], the most famous water-woman is Maria Enganxa. According to tradition, she lives inside all the [[Water well|wells]] and cisterns and takes all the children that pass near them with her hook.

==Appearance==
Water-women symbolize the [[fertility]] and life-giving [[virtue]]s of water and are said to possess [[Dream|oneiric]] [[beauty]].

They are said to appear as small and innocent women, with a high [[self-esteem]] and very prideful of their beauty. They are good women and try to bring [[wealth]] and well-being to the areas they live in.

According to myth, water-women are nocturnal; have shimmering gold or [[red hair]], and [[emerald]] or deep blue eyes; wear fine, rich clothes; and enjoy viewing their reflections in [[lake]]s on full-moon nights. Some of them are said to have beautiful wings of various colors. Many are said to carry magic [[wand]]s carved from [[hazel]], which is considered to be the only wood capable of casting spells.

==Human interaction==
There are many legends about romance and [[marriage]] between water-women and humans. In order to marry a water-woman, a human must agree to the water-woman's conditions. Often, one of the conditions is that the husband cannot reveal that his wife is a water-woman. If he does, the water-woman leaves him and disappears with his [[Wealth|fortune]]. However, it is also said that the water-woman will still comb her children's hair and dress them every morning.

Water-women are purported to avoid any relations with [[human]]s, though this is not always possible. When contact with humans does occur, it often turns out ill for the humans.

{{Nihongo|'''Ame-no-tajikarao'''|アメノタジカラオ}} is a Japanese deity ([[kami]]) who appears in [[Japanese mythology]]. Ame-no-tajikarao is written as 天手力男神 in ''[[Kojiki]]'', and 天手力雄神 in ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''.

== Mythological description ==
At the event of [[Amano-Iwato]], Ame-no-tajikarao waited at the caves' door to pull out (in the ''Nihon Shoki'' and the [[Kogo Shūi]], 'to pull open') [[Amaterasu]] (天照) from the cave, and thus return light to the world.

During the [[Tenson kōrin]], Amaterasu had [[Omoikane (Shinto)|Omoikane]], Ame-no-tajikarao, and Ama-no-iwato-wake-no-kami accompany the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]] when it went to the [[Ise province]] to be enshrined at [[Ise Grand Shrine]].

== Explanation ==
The name Ame-no-tajikarao carries the connotation of a male god with great physical brute strength.

== Religious Belief ==
Ame-no-tajikaro is believed to be a god of sports and physical power, and is enshrined at shrines associated with Ise Grand Shrine such as [[Togakushi Shrine]] (戸隠神社), Sano Shrine (佐那神社), Shiroi Shrine (白井神社), Oyama Shrine (雄山神社), Tejikarao Shrine (手力雄神社) (Gifu), Tejikarao Shrine (手力雄神社) (Kakamigahara), Toake Shrine (戸明神社), and Ame-no-ta-nagao Shrine (天手長男神社). His own Shinto priests think he was originally a protector of agriculture (maybe because he brought back sun light to the world, or maybe because peasants need fitness to work in the fields). Strangely, this god is often in association with [[Sugawara no Michizane]], as the god ''[[Tenjin (kami)|Tenjin]]''.

At the Togakushi Shrine there's a legend that says that the cave door that Ame-no-tajikarao threw away landed on Togakushi mountain (戸隠山) in [[Shinano Province]] (信濃国).

'''Amrit Sanchar''' (also called '''Khande di Pahul''') is the [[Sikh]] ceremony of initiation or [[baptism]]. The Amrit Sanchar is the initiation rite introduced by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] when he founded the [[Khalsa]] in 1699.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh|title=Amrit ceremony|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/ritesrituals/amrit.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sikh]] who has been initiated into the [[Khalsa]] is titled as "Amritdhari" or "Khalsa" after ''Singh'' (man) or ''Kaur'' (woman). Those who undergo initiation are expected to dedicate themselves to [[Waheguru]] and work toward the establishment of the [[Khalsa Raj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|last=Woodhead|first=Linda|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9780415858809|location=New York|pages=140|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sikh Reht Maryada.

==History==

Khande di Pahul was initiated in the times of Guru Gobind Singh ji when the Guru established the Order of [[Khalsa]] at [[Anandpur Sahib]] on the day of [[Vaisakhi]] in 1699. [[Guru Gobind Singh]] addressed the congregation from the entryway of a tent pitched on a hill (now called Kesgarh Sahib). He drew his sword and asked for a volunteer who was willing to sacrifice his head. No one answered his first call, nor the second call, but on the third invitation, a person called Daya Ram (later known as Bhai Daya Singh) came forward and offered his head to the Guru. Guru Gobind Singh took the volunteer inside the tent, and emerged shortly, with blood dripping from his sword. He then demanded another head. One more volunteer came forward, and entered the tent with him. The Guru again emerged with blood on his sword. This happened three more times. Then the five volunteers came out of the tent unharmed. Everyone was very confused.

These five men came to be known as [[Panj Piare]] or the "Beloved Five". These five were initiated into the [[Khalsa]] by receiving Amrit. These five were [[Bhai Daya Singh]], [[Bhai Mukham Singh]], [[Bhai Sahib Singh]], [[Bhai Dharam Singh]] and [[Bhai Himmat Singh]]. Sikh men were then given the name ''[[Singh]]'' meaning "[[lion]]" and the women received the last name ''[[Kaur]]'' meaning "princess"

''Khande Di Pahul'' not only embodies the primary objects of Sikh faith and the promises connected therewith, but also is itself a promise to lead a pure and pious life to unite with Almighty Lord. It is about inward cleansing of the conscience and seeking unity with Supreme Lord through His Grace. The word ''Pahul'' is a derivative from the substantive ''Pahu'' – which is an agent which brightens, accelerates or sharpens the potentialities of a given object

==Ceremony==
[[Max Arthur Macauliffe]] wrote:

:''"The Guru caused  his five faithful Sikhs to stand up. He put pure water into an iron vessel and stirred it with a Khanda or two edged sword. He then repeated over it the sacred verses which he appointed for the ceremony, namely, the Japji, the Jaap, Guru Amar Das's Anand, and certain swaiyas or quatrains of his own composition."''
   
::– The Sikh Religion by M.A. Macauliffe, V–5, p. 94

*The ceremony is to be conducted in any quiet and convenient place. In addition to the Guru Granth Sahib, the presence of six Sikhs is necessary, one ''granthi'' to read from the holy text and five, representing the original five beloved disciples, to administer it.
*Washing of the hair prior to the ceremony is mandatory by those who are receiving the initiation and those who are administering.
*Any Sikh who is mentally and physically sound (male or female) may administer the rites of initiation if he himself had received the rites and continues to adheres to the Sikh ''Rehni'' (Way of Life) and wear the Sikh ''Articles of Faith'', i.e. [[Five Ks|5 Ks]].
*There is no minimum age requirement, but a person who is considering to be Amritdhari should not be of a very young age but have attained a plausible degree of discretion.
*The person to be Amritdhari must have taken bath and washed the hair and must wear the five holy symbols, the [[Five Ks]]: Kesh (unshorn hair), strapped Kirpan (sword), Kachhehra (prescribed shorts), Kanga (comb tucked in the tied-up hair), Karha (steel bracelet). He/she must not have on his/her person any jewellery, distinctive marks or token associated with any other faith. He/she must not have his/her head bare or be wearing a cap. The head must be covered with a cloth. He/she must not be wearing any ornaments piercing through any part of the body. The persons to be Amritdhari must stand respectfully with hands folded facing the Guru Granth Sahib.
*Anyone seeking re-initiation after having resiled from his previous vows may be assigned a penance by the five administering initiation before being re-admitted.
*During the ceremony, one of the five ''Pyare'' (the beloved ones), stands and explains the rules and obligations of the [[Khalsa|Khalsa Panth]].
*Those receiving initiation have to give their assent as to whether they are willing to abide by the rules and obligations.
*After their assent, one of the five ''Pyare'' utters a prayer for the commencement of the preparation of the Amrit and a randomly selected passage (hukam, or word of God) is taken from Sri Guru Granth Sahib.

The person being initiated ''"Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh"''. The salutation is repeated and the holy water is sprinkled on their eyes and hair, five times. The remainder of the nectar is shared by all receiving the initiation, all drinking from the same bowl.

After this, all those taking part in the ceremony recite the [[Mool Mantra]] and they are inducted into the [[Khalsa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4092">[[File:Antistes of Zurich.png|thumb|The Antistes of [[Zurich]] from [[Zwingli]] to Nüscheler]]
'''Antistes''' (from [[Latin Language]] "anti "before" and sto "stand") was from the 16th to the 19th century the title of the head of the church in the [[Reformed Churches]] in [[Switzerland]]. It was the highest office in churches with [[synod]]al church governance. 

The word was used first in 1525 as an unofficial title of honor for [[Huldrych Zwingli]] in [[Canton of Zurich|Zurich]], then 1530 for [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] in [[Canton of Basel|Basel]] and 1532 for [[Heinrich Bullinger]] in Zurich.

The antistes was elected by the great council (the parliament) of the city and held besides this office also a pastorship of one of the main churches. 

The antistes had to be an ordained minister. He was the official representative of the church. He was presiding the [[synod]], and the theological examinations of candidates for the  office of pastor. His direct rights were very limited, but a man with high leadership capabilities like Zwingli or Bullinger could exert a great influence on the church in this office.

In the late 19th century the title was replaced by other office designations, e.g. church president or president of the church council.

'''Chibafruime''', also spelled as '''Chibrafruime''', was a minor deity in the [[Muisca religion|religion]] of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]].&lt;ref name=Bogotalogo_p55&gt;Bogotálogo, 2012, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; It was the god of [[Muisca warfare|war]].&lt;ref&gt;Triana de Riveros, 1996, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henao, 2011, p.317&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muisca mythology|Mythological tales]] about Chibafruime have been noted in [[Bojacá]], [[Bosa (Bogotá)|Bosa]], [[Guatavita]], [[Turmequé]] and [[Cajicá]].&lt;ref&gt;Quintana de Afanador, 2002, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henao, 2011, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henao, 2011, p.139, p.143-146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henao, 2011, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henao, 2011, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henao, 2011, p.284&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Chibafruime and his appearance, which may have been in the shape of a [[jaguar]]. The Muisca were more [[Muisca economy#Trade|traders]] than warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Daza, 2013, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Their negotiation skills were admired by the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|conquistadors who made first contact with the Muisca]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 1993, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of Muisca scholars|Scholar]] [[Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita]] has provided the little information about Chibafruime.

{{Violence against Buddhists}}

The '''Chittagong Hill Tracts conflict''' was a political and armed conflict between the government of [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti]] (United People's Party of the Chittagong Hill Tracts) and its armed wing, the [[Shanti Bahini]], over the issue of autonomy and the land rights of [[Jumma people]], [[Chakma people]] and the other indigenous of [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. Shanti Bahini launched an insurgency against government forces in 1977, when the country was under [[Military coups in Bangladesh|military rule]], and the conflict continued for twenty years until the government and the PCJSS signed the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="KS"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rashiduzzaman | first = M. |date=July 1998 | title = Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord: Institutional Features and Strategic Concerns | journal = Asian Survey | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 653–70 | publisher = University of California Press | jstor =2645754| doi = 10.1525/as.1998.38.7.01p0370e}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CVX"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bangladesh peace treaty signed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/despatches/36256.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2 December 1997 |accessdate=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZV"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chittagong marks peace anniversary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/226373.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2 December 1998 |accessdate=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mohsin |first=Amena |year=2012 |chapter=Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, 1997 |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chittagong_Hill_Tracts_Peace_Accord,_1997 |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mochta"&gt;[http://www.mochta.gov.bd/faq.php Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708205108/http://www.mochta.gov.bd/faq.php |date=8 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actions carried out by the armed forces and the paramilitary groups helping them have been projected by tribals as [[genocide]] and [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="Arens 2010 p123" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonassohn 1998 p257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Begovich 2007 p166" /&gt; There have been reports of mass rapes by the paramilitary [[Bangladesh Ansars]], though these have been disputed.&lt;ref name="Jonassohn 1998 p258" /&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]] as of June 2013 the Bangladeshi government made "praiseworthy progress" in implementing the terms of the peace accord and in addressing the Jumma people's concerns over the return of their land. Amnesty estimate that there are currently only 900 internally displaced Jumma families.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Erueti ABC 2013" /&gt;

==Background==
The conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts dates back to when [[Bangladesh]] was the [[East Pakistan|eastern wing]] of [[Pakistan]]. Widespread resentment occurred over the displacement of as many as 100,000 of the native peoples due to the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in 1962. The displaced did not receive compensation from the government and many thousands fled to [[India]]. After the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|creation of Bangladesh]] in 1971, representatives of the Chittagong Hill Tracts who were against Bangladeshi independence such as the [[Chakma people|Chakma]] politician [[Manabendra Narayan Larma]] sought autonomy and recognition of the rights of the peoples of the region. Larma and other Hill Tracts representatives protested the draft of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]]. It did not recognise the ethnic identity and culture of the non-Muslim, non-[[Bengali people|Bengali]] peoples of Bangladesh. The government policy recognised only the [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali culture]] and the [[Bengali language]], and designated all citizens of Bangladesh as [[Bengali people|Bengalis]]. In talks with a Chittagong Hill Tracts delegation led by Manabendra Narayan Larma, the country's founding leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] expressed that the ethnic groups of the Hill Tracts as citizen of Bangladesh should have the Bengali identity.&lt;ref name="F"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nagendra K.

==Insurgency==
Larma and others founded the Parbatya Chhatagram Jana Shanghatti Samiti (PCJSS) as a united political organisation of all native peoples and tribes in 1973. The armed wing of the PCJSS, the [[Shanti Bahini]] was organised to resist government policies.&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nagendra K. Singh |title= Encyclopaedia of Bangladesh |pages=229 |publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt. Ltd. |year=2003 |isbn=81-261-1390-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis aggravated during the [[emergency rule]] of Sheikh Mujib, who had banned all political parties other than his [[BAKSAL]] and the successive [[Military coups in Bangladesh|military regimes]] that followed after his [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|assassination in 1975]]. In 1977, the Shanti Bahini launched their first attack on a [[Bangladesh Army]] convoy.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/11/world/bangladeshi-insurgents-say-india-is-supporting-them.html Bangladeshi Insurgents Say India Is Supporting Them – New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F1"/&gt; It is alleged that the Indian government helped the Shanti Bahini set up bases across the border from Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2504753/Bangladesh_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Chittagong_Hill_Tract_CHT_Peace_Accord|title=Bangladesh: A Critical Review of the Chittagong Hill Tract (CHT) Peace Accord|author=A. Kabir|publisher=|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shanti Bahini divided its area of operations into zones and raised forces from the native people, who were formally trained. The Shanti Bahini attacked Bengali police and soldiers, government offices and personnel and the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] settlers in the region. The group also attacked any native believed to be opposing it and supporting the government.&lt;ref name="CV2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kader |first=Rozina |year=2012 |chapter=Shanti Bahini |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shanti_Bahini |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to government sources between 1980 and 1991, 1,180 people were killed by the Shanti Bahini, and 582 were kidnapped.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031203114/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA130012000 Human rights in the Chittagong Hill Tracts]; February 2000; [[Amnesty International]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human rights abuses against the Jumma ==
[[File:Sculpture Glorifying Bangladesh Military - Bandarban - Chittagong Hill Tracts - Bangladesh (13240275903).jpg|thumbnail|Sculpture glorifying the Bangladeshi military in the Bandarban Hill tracts.]]
Bangladesh was under military rule for fifteen years and democracy was restored in 1990.&lt;ref name="British Broadcasting Corporation" /&gt; During this period there were several massacres of Jumma peoples in the CHT, the main perpetrators of these acts of mass violence being the Bangladesh armed forces.&lt;ref name="Roy 2005 p123" /&gt; The UN special rapporteur has reported on extrajudicial, arbitrary and summary executions and that he had received reports of numerous human rights violations.&lt;ref name="Roy 2000 p123" /&gt;

===Massacres===
* In 1980, Bangladeshi armed forces attacked the village of Kawkhali and left 300 dead.&lt;ref name="Roy 2000 p123" /&gt;
* Another massacre occurred on 3 March when the Bangladeshi armed forces killed between 3,000 and 4,000 people.&lt;ref name="Jonassohn 1998 p257" /&gt;
* Another massacre occurred on 25 March 1981 in which settlers attacked and killed 500 people in Matiranga.&lt;ref name="Roy 2000 p123" /&gt;
* Shanti Bahini killed 13 Bengali civilians and 24 members of Bangladesh Rifles on 23 June 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4B0vAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Shanti+Bahini&amp;dq=Shanti+Bahini&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1kr2v3anTAhUL64MKHbrGBVcQ6AEItgEwGg|title=The Election Archives|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|publisher=Shiv Lal|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=218|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another massacre occurred in 1986 in Panchari.
* Another massacre occurred in 1989 in Longudu which left 40 Jumma peoples dead and displaced a further 13,000.&lt;ref name="D'Costa 2012 p136" /&gt;
* Another massacre occurred in 1992 in [[Logang massacre|Logang]] which caused the deaths of hundreds of people with reports that hundreds had been burned alive and others shot dead while trying to escape. The incident led to the EU passing a resolution requesting that Bangladesh put a halt to continued violence in the CHT.&lt;ref name="Roy 2000 p123" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy 2000 p222" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arens 2010 p 141" /&gt;

* Another massacre took place in 1996, when 28 Bengali Woodcutters were killed by Members of the Shanti Bahini.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/09/11/d40911070266.htm|title=Army pullout from CHT opposed by settlers|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapes===

Between 1981 and 1994 it is estimated that 2,500 Jumma women had been raped by Bangladesh armed forces and in 1995 it was estimated that of over 94% of rapes between 1991 and 1993 had been by the Bangladesh armed forces, with allegations that 80% of those raped were Jumma. According to Kabita Chakma and Glen Hill, the sexual abuse against Jumma women is endemic.&lt;ref name="Chakma 2013 p144" /&gt; During the conflict, the security forces had used a deliberate strategy of rape, torture, arbitrary arrests, mass imprisonment and kidnapping against the Jumma.&lt;ref name="Begovich 2007 p169" /&gt;

===Recent Developments===

The accords of the peace treaty have yet to be fully implemented which has resulted in the region remaining heavily militarised and mass inward migration continuing. Human rights violations continue with arbitrary arrests, killing and rapes occurring and human rights activists are targeted for questioning and arrests.&lt;ref name="Wessendorf 2009 pp12-23" /&gt; According to a report from the Asian Centre for Human Rights on 26 August 2003 the UPDF in conjunction with tribals planned and launched an attack on ten villages. Hundreds of people were displaced and it is estimated that ten women, some who were Jumma were raped. It was reported that a nine-month-old child was strangled after it was grabbed from its grandmother who the settlers raped.&lt;ref name="Chakma 2003 p4" /&gt;

As yet the Jumma peoples have not been given constitutional recognition and are known as "backward segments of the population"&lt;ref name="Wessendorf 2011 p328" /&gt;

==Government reaction==
[[File:Chittagong Hill Tracts locator map.svg|thumb|200px|right|A map of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.]]
At the outbreak of the insurgency, the Government of Bangladesh deployed the army to begin counter-insurgency operations. The then-[[President of Bangladesh]] [[Ziaur Rahman]] created a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board]] under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust amongst the native people against the government. The government failed to address the long-standing issue of the displacement of people, numbering an estimated 100,000 caused by the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="internal"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displaced peoples did not receive compensation and more than 40,000 Chakma tribals had fled to India.&lt;ref name="internal"/&gt; In the 1980s, the government began settling Bengalis in the region, causing the eviction of many natives and a significant alteration of demographics. Having constituted only 11.6% of the regional population in 1974, the number of Bengalis grew by 1991 to constitute 48.5% of the regional population.

In 1989, the government of then-president [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]] passed the District Council Act created three tiers of local government councils to devolve powers and responsibilities to the representatives of the native peoples, but the councils were rejected and opposed by the PCJSS.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

==Peace accord==
{{main|Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord}}
Peace negotiations were initiated after the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh in 1991, but little progress was made with the government of Prime Minister [[Begum Khaleda Zia]], the widow of Ziaur Rahman and her [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]].&lt;ref name="CV3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Majumder |first=Shantanu |year=2012 |chapter=Parbatya Chattagram Jana-Samhati Samiti |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Parbatya_Chattagram_Jana-Samhati_Samiti |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh rounds of talks began in 1996 with the newly elected prime minister [[Sheikh Hasina Wajed]] of the [[Awami League]], the daughter of Sheikh Mujib.&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt; The peace accord was finalised and formally signed on 2 December 1997.&lt;ref name="Mochta"/&gt;

The '''dambana''', in modern times, may refer to shrines of indigenous religions in the [[Philippines]] (mainly [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] areas), altar of Philippine churches, or monuments erected to remember Philippine history. However, before the introduction of Roman Catholicism in the Philippines, the dambana ([[Old Tagalog]]: '''lambana''')&lt;ref name="blumetritt"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferdinand Blumentritt |editor =|title =Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes|chapter =Alphabetisches Verzeichnis der bei den philippinischen Eingeborenen üblichen Eigennamen, welche auf Religion, Opfer und priesterliche Titel und Amtsverrichtungen sich beziehen.

Additionally, these ''dambanas'' were also traditionally called as '''simbahan''', however, the latter's meaning was fully transformed by the Spanish in the 16th century until it only referred to 'Catholic church' by the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/modules/modules/philippinereligions/article_indigenous_beliefs.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional dambana beliefs, all deities, beings sent by Bathala, and ancestor spirits are collectively called ''[[anito]]s''. Supernatural non-[[anito]] beings are called ''lamang-lupa'' (beings of the land) or ''lamang-dagat'' (beings of the sea or other water bodies). The ''dambana'' is usually taken cared of by the ''[[katalonan]]'', the indigenous spiritual leader of the ''[[barangay]]'' (community), and to some extent, the ''datu'' (barangay political leader) and the ''lakan'' (barangay coalition political leader) as well. Initially unadorned and revered minimally,&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Emma Helen; Robertson, James Alexander, eds. (1903). Relation of the Conquest of the Island of Luzon. The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898. 3. Ohio, Cleveland: Arthur H. Clark Company. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; ''damabanas'' later on were filled with adornments centering on religious practices towards ''larauan'' statues due to trade and religious influences from various independent and vassal states.&lt;ref&gt;http://opinion.inquirer.net/78366/history-in-language&lt;/ref&gt; It is adorned with statues home to ''anitos'' traditionally-called ''larauan'', statues reserved for future burial practices modernly-called ''likha'', scrolls or documents with ''[[suyat]]'' ''[[baybayin]]'' calligraphy,&lt;ref&gt;http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/985669/protect-all-ph-writing-systems-heritage-advocates-urge-congress&lt;/ref&gt; and other objects sacred to ''dambana'' practices such as ''lambanog'' (distilled coconut wine), ''tuba'' (undistilled coconut wine), ''bulaklak'' or flowers (like [[sampaguita]], [[Ixora coccinea|santan]], [[Hibiscus|gumamela]], [[jade vine|tayabak]], and native [[orchid]]s), ''palay'' (unhusked rice), ''bigas'' (husked rice), shells, pearls, jewels, beads, native crafts such as ''banga'' (pottery),&lt;ref&gt;http://malacanang.gov.ph/75832-pre-colonial-manila/&lt;/ref&gt; native swords and bladed weapons (such as ''[[kampilan]]'', ''[[dahong palay]]'', ''[[Bolo knife|bolo]]'', and ''[[panabas]]''), bodily accessories (like ''singsing'' or rings, ''kwintas'' or necklaces, and ''hikaw'' or earrings), war shields (such as ''[[kalasag]]''), enchanted masks,&lt;ref&gt;https://aboutphilippines.ph/documents-etc/Anthropological-reflection-on-Philippine-masks.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; battle weapons used in ''[[arnis|pananandata or kali]]'', charms called ''[[agimat]]'' or ''anting-anting'',&lt;ref&gt;https://businessmirror.com.ph/filipinization-and-the-flag-as-amulet-against-bad-luck/&lt;/ref&gt; curse deflectors such as ''[[Buntot Pagi|buntot pagi]]'', native garments and embroideries, food, and gold in the form of adornments (gold belts, necklace, wrist rings, and feet rings) and barter money (''[[piloncitos]]'' and gold rings).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagalog-dictionary.com/search?word=dambana&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/ispeak/60815-identity-crisis-filipino&lt;/ref&gt;

==Man-made (Built) Dambanas==

The dambana can be a sacred structure built with different materials, depending on the locality, but the usual dambana structure is made from indigenous [[wood]] with [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]] roofs. No metal nails are used in its construction. The wood pieces are shaped in a way that each block would stick tightly to each other. At the same time, the wood bonds are strengthened by [[rattan]] strips. Majority of these man-made ''dambana'' structures (along with the materials assigned to dambana traditions such as statues home to anitos called ''larauan'', statues reserved for burial practices in the future called ''likha'', and documents with ''[[baybayin]]'' writings and calligraphy)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=mhBgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Likha+statues&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xEIvxrQVCM&amp;sig=M6zYYs0ofLrZClZJZXK6Bpo3cJ8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj_lILHnfzaAhWEfrwKHX82C5MQ6AEwCXoECAAQSg#v=onepage&amp;q=Likha&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; were unfortunately destroyed by the Spanish in the 16th century, while transforming the land where the ''dambana'' structures were built upon into Catholic cemeteries or locations for Roman Catholic churches. The purge against ''dambana'' structures and all things related to indigenous religion was continued by the Spanish until the 18th century to destroy ''Anitism'' or the indigenous religion of the Tagalog people, leaving no ''dambana'' structures left throughout areas subjugated by the Spanish Crown.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagalog-dictionary.com/search?word=dambana&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural and non-house Dambanas==

In addition, not all ''dambanas'' are house structures. Some dambanas may be traditional non-Western cemeteries (''libingan''), ancient ruins or old places (''sinaunang pook''), rivers (''ilog''), [[mountain]]s (''bundok''), mounds (''burol''), seas (''karagatan''), [[cave]]s (''yungib''), lakes (''lawa''), forests (''gubat'') giant trees (''malalaking puno'') such as ''balete'' (one of the three most sacred trees for the Tagalogs, the other two being ''kawayan'' or bamboo and ''buko'' or coconut tree), and other places known to the natural and spiritual world, except for swamps, which are called ''buhay na tubig'' (living waters)&lt;ref&gt;http://ichcourier.ichcap.org/en/experiencing-healing-rituals-of-the-philippines-2/&lt;/ref&gt; and are considered as sacred but dangerous to the Tagalog people in pre-colonial times due to the presence of life-threatening supernatural beings. The presence of these natural ''dambanas'' is one of the primary reasons why indigenous belief systems continued to exist despite the Spanish-imposed all-out destruction of ''dambana'' structures. The ethnic group that is usually associated with the dambana are the [[Tagalog people]], although the majority of the Tagalogs have been converted into Christianity through forced religious Spanish rule between the 16th to 19th centuries. Due to this, majority of the indigenous Tagalog dambana practices have been lost, fragmented severely, or absorbed into Christian practices, such as the case in pilgrim devotion practices in [[Mount Makiling]], which has Catholic and indigenous Tagalog practices involved. The unaltered ''dambana'' practices of the Tagalog people are similar to [[shrine]] practices in Asia, such as the shrine practices in [[Japan]], [[Bali]], and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagalog-dictionary.com/search?word=dambana&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anitos==
{{see also|Deities of Philippine mythology#Ancient Tagalog Deities}}
''Dambana'' practices are performed through various means such as thanksgiving, wish prayers, or even memorializing an event. All deities, beings sent by Bathala, and ancestral spirits are collectively called ''anito''. The deity who is most invoked in ''dambana'' practices is [[Bathala]], the supreme god of the Tagalog people who controls non-deity anitos and the [[tigmamanukan]] omens. Bathala is among the five primordial deities in the Tagalog pantheon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvnb|Mabel Cook Cole|pp=99–101, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that he lives in an abode called ''Kaluwalhatian''&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=likha+statue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gx1jPG-5XB&amp;sig=PwbZZzZD7pD10HLZJvq17xoINJs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit0provMLbAhWFgbwKHWZFDk0Q6AEIhAEwEA#v=onepage&amp;q=likha%20statue&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; with other deities such as Amanikable, god of hunters and turbulent waters,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rebecca Ramilio Ongsotto, Reynaldo Castillo Ramilo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idiyanale, goddess of labor,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rebecca Ramilio Ongsotto, Reynaldo Castillo Ramilo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimangan, god of good harvests, Lakapati, god/goddess of fertility and cultivated fields, Mapulon, god of seasons, Mayari, goddess of the moon,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Erlinda D. Lalic, Avelina J. Matic |pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tala, goddess of the stars, Hanan, goddess of morning, Dumakulem, god of mountains, Anitun Tabu, goddess of wind and rain, Anagolay, goddess of lost things, Apolaki, god of the sun,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Erlinda D. Lalic, Avelina J. Matic |pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Diyan Masalanta, goddess of love. Minor deities who live in Kaluwalhatian include Liwayway, a dawn goddess, Tag-ani, a harvest goddess, Kidlat, a lightning god, and Hangin, a wind god.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/rainbows-in-philippine-mythology-folklore/&lt;/ref&gt; The abode ''Kaluwalhatian'', however, is not to be associated as a place where ancestral spirits go to. The place where good ancestral spirits go to is located below the earth and is called ''Maca'', while the place where evil ancestral spirits go to is called ''Kasamaan'' (or ''Kasanaan'')&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=likha+statue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gx1jPG-5XB&amp;sig=PwbZZzZD7pD10HLZJvq17xoINJs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit0provMLbAhWFgbwKHWZFDk0Q6AEIhAEwEA#v=onepage&amp;q=likha%20statue&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;, which is also below the earth. Unlike ''Kasanaan'', which is a 'village of grief and affliction', ''Maca'' is peaceful and filled with the joyous bounties good ancestral spirits deserve in the afterlife. ''Maca'' is ruled jointly by [[Bathala]], who has the prowess to summon and order spirits from ''Maca'' (and ''Kasamaan'') if he pleases, and Sitan while ''Kasamaan'' is ruled solely by a deity named Sitan, keeper of all souls and master of four evil deities, namely, Manggagaway, causer of diseases, Manisilat, destroyer of families, Mangkukulam, causer of fires, and Hukluban, causer of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Thelma B. Kintanar, Jose V. Abueva, pp. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thelma B. Kintanar, Jose V. Abueva, pp. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagaloglang.com/bathala-the-tagalog-god/&lt;/ref&gt;

Deities living with humans, and not in ''Kaluwalhatian'', ''Maca'', or ''Kasamaan'' are also known in the Tagalog pantheon of anitos. These deities include Aman Sinaya, god of oceans and one of the five primordial deities, Amihan, deity of peace and one of the five primordial deities, Sinaya, god of inventors and fisherfolks, Haik, god of calm waters, Lakambakod, god of protections, Lakambini, god of purity, food, and festivities, Lingga, god of medicine, Bibit, god of illness, Uwinan Sana, god of grasslands and forests, Melupa, crow god of the earth, Silagan, god of proper burial practices, Mananangal, goddess of fright, Bighari, goddess of rainbows,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/rainbows-in-philippine-mythology-folklore/&lt;/ref&gt; and Mankukutod, god of the coconut and direct descendant of the ashes of Ulilang Kaluluwa and Galang Kaluluwa, two of the five primordial deities.&lt;ref&gt;Leticia Ramos Shahani, Fe B. Mangahas, Jenny R. Llaguno, pp. 27, 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonia M. Zaide, Gregorio F. Zaide, pp. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Anitos sent by Bathala to aid mankind, aside from the deities, are also called as anitos. These include [[Maria Makiling|Makiling]], anito of Mount Makiling, and other community-based anitos. Ancestral spirits are also referred as anitos. These ancestral spirit anitos can be called upon by his or her descendants, relatives, friends, or stern followers in aid of a task. However, the approval of Bathala is needed first so that the ancestral spirit may be allowed to leave ''Maca'' and aid a person through dreams or apparitions. Popular ancestral spirits that are called upon are ''[[katalonan]]s'', ''[[datu]]s'', ''[[lakan]]s'', expert craftsmen, and brave warriors who have passed away and are believed to have journeyed to ''Maca'' successfully.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/bathala/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/ancient-tagalog-deities-in-philippine-mythology/&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest beings in Anitism are always the primordial deities, which is led by [[Bathala]]. Of these five primordial deities, only Bathala, Amihan, and Aman Sinaya are living deities. The other two, Ulilang Kaluluwa and Galang Kaluluwa, have turned into ashes during the first centuries of the cosmic creation. The next in rank are the deity anitos, whether they live in ''Kaluwalhatian'', ''Kasamaan'', or in the middle world.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=likha+statue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gx1jPG-5XB&amp;sig=PwbZZzZD7pD10HLZJvq17xoINJs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit0provMLbAhWFgbwKHWZFDk0Q6AEIhAEwEA#v=onepage&amp;q=likha%20statue&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The third in rank are the anitos sent by Bathala to aid mankind. These anitos usually serve specific communities, and seldom spread their influence from their domain, such as the case of the anito, [[Maria Makiling|Makiling]]. Like mankind, these anitos are sometimes prone to misdeeds but are generally good.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/legend-of-the-firefly/&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth in rank are mankind's anito ancestral spirits (known as ''kaluluwa''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/&lt;/ref&gt;, the second and last form of the soul). The last rank includes ''tao'' (mankind) which houses the ''kakambal''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/&lt;/ref&gt; (literally twin; the first form of soul known as the living soul who wanders when the body is asleep), ''mga hayop'' (animals), ''halaman at puno'' (plants and trees), ''lamang lupa'' (supernatural beings of the land), and ''lamang dagat'' (supernatural beings of the waters).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leticia Ramos Shahani, Fe B.

==Notable Dambanas==
Most of the remaining ''dambanas'' are natural, and not man-made, as majority of the man-made ''dambanas'' were completely destroyed by the Spanish during a 300-year Catholic-colonial period from the 16th century to the 19th century. However, remnants of man-made ''dambanas'' have been rediscovered since the middle of the 20th century, such as the [[Angono Petroglyphs]] in [[Rizal]] which was rediscovered in 1965 and the [[Limestone tombs of Kamhantik]] in [[Quezon province]] which was rediscovered in 2011. Other archaeological sites with traditional religious artifacts have been rediscovered in [[Calatagan, Batangas]], [[Santa Ana, Manila]], [[Bulacan]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bulsu.edu.ph/news/2017/05/19/25/from-history-to-prehistory-the-archaeology-of-tanggapan-cave-biak-na-bato&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marinduque]],&lt;ref&gt;Zugwalt, E. "Archaeology in the Philippines". Treasure and Antique Seeking. Retrieved&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cavite]], and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]].&lt;ref&gt;Vitales, Timothy James. 2013. Archaeological Research in the Laguna de Bay area, Philippines. Hukay, Volume 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent natural ''dambanas'' include [[Mount Makiling]], [[Mount San Cristobal]], [[Mount Banahaw]], [[Laguna de Bay]], [[Taal Volcano]] and lake, the [[Seven Lakes of San Pablo]], the southern chain of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre mountains]], the Bathala caves of [[Marinduque]], the [[Lobo, Batangas|Lobo mountain chain]], and various falls, rivers, and bays in the southern Tagalog region and certain areas in central Luzon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawstude.net/2012/05/marinduque-bathala-caves.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://philurbanlegends.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-first-article-i-created-here-about.html&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, traditional Tagalogs also believe in a reappearing ''dambana'' called Mount Batala, which is [[Bathala]]'s most sacred mountain and is filled with [[tigmamanukan]] omen birds. However, Bathala is said to disallow ordinary mortals from entering the realm.&lt;ref&gt;Leticia Ramos Shahani, Fe B. Mangahas, Jenny R. Llaguno, pp. 27, 28, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some tigmamanukan omen birds living within the realm are colored 'yellow', and considered extremely sacred.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/role-birds-serpents-philippine-mythology/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration of Anitism==
The Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines, which is primarily governed by the Vatican, and other Christian churches are against the revitalization of ''Anitism'' since the 16th century as they view the indigenous Tagalog religion as 'less than European religions'. However, in recent years, a number of Tagalog people have reverted to '''Anitism''', or the indigenous religion of pre-colonial Tagalogs, from colonially-imposed Roman Catholicism or other Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/apolakis-lament-gods/&lt;/ref&gt; Today's practices are notably influenced by modernity, same as all religions in the world, due to an array of inevitable religious dynamisms.&lt;ref&gt;https://upaasvblog.wordpress.com/2017/11/02/apolakis-lament-who-killed-the-ancient-filipino-gods/&lt;/ref&gt; Although no expansive ''dambana'' structures have been built, natural dambanas such as Mount Makiling and Mount Banahaw are thoroughly used to preserve the ancient religion. There is no specific area in a room where the sacred ''larauan''&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Ca5XDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA402&amp;lpg=PA402&amp;dq=likha+statue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HG51WVQP1n&amp;sig=KzrodilYRN_OPsWQhQoSSpd07Mg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-uPH5vMLbAhXMxrwKHd8mALs4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=likha%20statue&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; was placed on during the classical era,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=likha+statue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gx1jPG-5XB&amp;sig=PwbZZzZD7pD10HLZJvq17xoINJs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit0provMLbAhWFgbwKHWZFDk0Q6AEIhAEwEA#v=onepage&amp;q=likha%20statue&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; but in modern practices, the eastern areas within the house of Anitism adherents are used as dambanas through an altar form, while prayers are offered to Bathala and other Tagalog deities and anitos. One of the primary reasons for this is the influence from other Asian religions and the belief that the east represents a new morning or age (personified by Hanan), the sun (personified by Apolaki), and the moon (personified by Mayari), thus personifying Bathala, ruler of everything. Traditionally, the ''larauan'' and ''likha''&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=jvOjDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=likha+statue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NsM_O8_-B2&amp;sig=FM-7bp8qJCVAwv8nX4IU4cwXvN8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit0provMLbAhWFgbwKHWZFDk0Q6AEIfjAO#v=onepage&amp;q=likha%20statue&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; statues placed on the ''dambana'' altar inside a house ''dambana'' or outside within a natural ''dambana'' are 4-12 inches tall, 2-8 inches wide, and are made of [[coral]] stone, [[limestone]], volcanic stone, clay, packed [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]], packed [[cogon]], or [[hardwood]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/7541675_266-philippines-limestone-sculpture-called-a-likha&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://prezi.com/nrxd-i9ya8_y/early-forms-and-traditional-sculpture-in-the-philippines/&lt;/ref&gt; The ''larauan'' statues are always larger than the ''likha'' statues. Due to modern influences, some ''larauan'' statues have also been made in human sizes.&lt;ref&gt;Vitaliano R. Gorospe, S.J., Chrisitian Renewal of Filipino Values.

'''Demiurge''' is an [[Anglicisation]] of a [[Greek language|Greek]] term, δημιουργός (''demiourgos'', "public worker"). It was used to describe a [[socioeconomic class]] and [[politics|political]] class in [[Ancient Greek]], and was adopted by [[Plato]] and later writers to describe a creator in their [[metaphysics]].

==Social==
# Beginning with [[Homeric Greek|Homer]] and continuing with later Greek writers, any skilled worker, including [[artisan]]s, [[herald]]s, and practical [[physician]]s (as opposed to scientific/research physicians and medical writers).
#  A member of the ''[[Demiourgoi]]'', a skilled-worker [[middle class]] between the aristocratic ''[[Eupatridae]]'' and the smallholder ''[[Geomori]]'' farmers, into which the mythical [[Theseus]] had purportedly divided the inhabitants of [[Attica]], according to [[Aristotle]]; a fourth class, the propertlyless ''[[thetes]]'', were excluded from government until the reforms of [[Solon]] and the creation of the [[timocracy]], a reformed [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] constitution that eventually evolved into the [[Athenian democracy]].

==Political==
{{main|Demiurge (magistrate)}}
# A [[magistrate]] in many [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesian]] and other Greek city-states, including [[Corinth]] and [[Argos]], originally drawn from the artisan class. In the [[Achaean League]], the assembly of members was presided over by ten elected ''demiourgoi''; Corinth sent ''epidemiourgoi'' annually to [[Potidaea]] to report to the [[Sparta]]n [[harmost]]s. The term is variously rendered ''daimourgos'', ''daimorgos'', and ''damiergos'' in [[Doric Greek]], and ''demiorgos'' in [[Ionic Greek]] on the island of [[Samos]]. In the Archaic Argolid, the demiurge seems to have served as a judge, and when one was lacking, his role could be fulfilled by a [[hierogrammat]], according to an inscription from [[Mycenae]] recorded in the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' IV, 493.

==Religion and Metaphysics==
# A philosophical concept, in [[Platonism]], [[Neoplatonism]], and [[Gnosticism]], of a supernatural fashioner of the [[universe]]. (See ''[[Demiurge]]'').
# In [[Berliner griechische Urkunden|third century papyri]], a term used by Greek writers to describe a member of one of the [[Religion in ancient Rome#Public priesthoods and religious law|various Roman priestly colleges]].

==Career==
Sears started writing plays when she was in college.&lt;ref name="writer in pines" /&gt; Her first novel was not published until 1997. She specializes in historical fiction. She chooses to write her books out by hand.&lt;ref name="writer in pines" /&gt; Many of her books center around female protagonists. Her novels often feature elements of [[Mormonism]] and [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref name="finding aid" /&gt; She often juxtaposes church principles and government ideologies.&lt;ref name="Deseret News jade box"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rappleye|first1=Christine|title='Letters in the Jade Dragon Box' explores family, faith|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705394028/Letters-in-the-Jade-Dragon-Box-explores-family-faith.html?pg=all|accessdate=6 July 2016|work=Deseret News|date=10 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to write her books, she spends hundreds of hours researching historical events and various cultures. In order to stay organized, she divides her research into folders.

The '''''haftarah''''' or (in [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] pronunciation) '''''haftorah''''' (alt. '''haphtara''', [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: הפטרה; "parting," "taking leave",&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], ''The Hirsch Siddur'' (orig. German 1868, English transl. 1978 (1978, NY, Feldheim Publrs) page 339, "The term Haftarah, derived from &amp;#1508;&amp;#1496;&amp;#1512; [''feter''], 'to dismiss' [as in 2nd Chron. 23:8] is the designation used.... It is the concluding portion of the Schaharith [morning] service, and marks the 'dismissal' of the congregation from the first part of the service, as it were."&lt;br&gt;  Or ''feter'' can mean "to set free", as in 1st Chron. 9:33 and Prov. 17:14. Solomon Gaon, ''Minhath Shelomo: A Commentary on the Book of Prayer of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews'' (1990, NY, Union of Sephardic Congregations) page 147; Israel Abrahams, ''A Companion to the Authorised Daily Prayer Book'' (1922, rev. ed., London) pages clvi-clvii; Israel Abrahams, ''Studies in Pharisaism and the Gospels'' (1917, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1st series) page 4-5; it appears that in antiquity the Sabbath service ended with the haftarah so that the congregation was dismissed and free to go home. The word ''haftaro'' - הפטרה - is used in  ''[[Midrash Rabbah]]'' of Genesis, sec. 69 (last paragraph), for "farewell speech".&lt;/ref&gt; plural ''haftoros'' or ''haftorot'' is a series of selections from the books of ''[[Nevi'im]]'' ("Prophets") of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (''Tanakh'') that is publicly read in [[synagogue]] as part of [[Judaism|Jewish religious practice]]. The Haftarah reading follows the [[Torah reading]] on each [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and on [[Jewish holidays|Jewish festivals]] and [[Ta'anit|fast day]]s. Typically, the ''haftarah'' is thematically linked to the ''[[parasha]]'' ([[Weekly Torah portion|Torah Portion]]) that precedes it.&lt;ref&gt;Goswell argues that the arrangement "suggests we should understand the books of Joshua - Kings as illustrating and applying the theology and ethics of the [[Pentateuch]]." Gregory Goswell, "The Hermeneutics of the Haftarot," ''[[Tyndale Bulletin]]'' 58 (2007), 100.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''haftarah'' is sung in a chant (known as "''trope''"  in [[Yiddish]] or "[[Cantillation]]" in English). Related blessings precede and follow the Haftarah reading.

The origin of haftarah reading is lost to history, and several theories have been proposed to explain its role in Jewish practice, suggesting it arose in response to the persecution of the [[Jews]] under [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] which preceded the [[Maccabean revolt]], wherein Torah reading was prohibited,&lt;ref name="Rabinowitz, Louis 2007"&gt;Rabinowitz, Louis. "Haftarah." Encyclopaedia Judaica. Eds. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 8. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 198-200. 22 vols. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Gale.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah: Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md.: Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; or that it was "instituted against the [[Samaritans]], who denied the [[Biblical canon|canon]]icity of the Prophets (except for Joshua), and later against the [[Sadducees]]."&lt;ref name="Rabinowitz, Louis 2007"/&gt;  Another theory is that it was instituted after some act of persecution or other disaster in which the synagogue Torah scrolls were destroyed or ruined - it was forbidden to read the Torah portion from any but a ritually fit parchment scroll, but there was no such requirement about a reading from Prophets, which was then "substituted as a temporary expedient and then remained."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew B. Schwartz, ''Torah Reading in the Ancient Synagogue'', Ph.D. dissertation, Wayne State Univ., 1975, page 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Talmud]] mentions that a ''haftarah'' was read in the presence of Rabbi [[Eliezer ben Hyrcanus]], who lived c.70 CE,&lt;ref&gt;Tosefta, Megillah, 4 (3): 1, gives the haftarot for the Four Special Sabbaths. A baraita in Megillah 31a, which has later additions by the Babylonian amoraim who add the haftarot for the second days of the festivals (and who sometimes change the order of the haftarot as a result) – gives the haftarot for every one of the festivals, including their intermediate Sabbaths, as well as a Sabbath which is also Rosh Hodesh, the Sabbath which immediately precedes Rosh Hodesh, and Hanukkah.&lt;/ref&gt; and that by the time of [[Rabbah bar Nahmani|Rabbah]] (the 3rd century) there was a "Scroll of Haftarot", which is not further described,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Babli, ''Gittin'' 60a.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]] several references suggest this Jewish custom was in place during that era.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 13:15 states that "after the reading of the law and the prophets" Paul was invited to deliver an exhortation. Luke 4:17 states that during the Sabbath service in Nazareth the Book of Isaiah was handed to Jesus, "and when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written," the passage being Isaiah 61:1–2. Unfortunately, the Greek word used there meaning "found" does not make it clear whether the passage read was fixed beforehand or whether it was chosen at random. See Rabinowitz, Louis. "Haftarah." Encyclopaedia Judaica. Eds. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 8. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 198-200. 22 vols. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Gale. Also Matthew B. Schwartz, ''Torah Reading in the Ancient Synagogue'', Ph.D. dissertation, Wayne State Univ., 1975, page 184, "In fact, the selection must have been made beforehand.",   The earliest source for evidence of haftarah readings is the New Testament, but it has been suggested that Jewish authorities following the New Testament period very deliberately avoided using as a haftarah any selection of the Prophets that had been mentioned in the New Testament. Hananel Mack, ''What happened to Jesus' haftarah?'' Haaretz, Aug. 12, 2005.  But D. Monshouwer, ''The Reading of the Prophet in the Synagogue at Nazareth'', Biblica, vol. 72, nr. 1 (1991) page 90-99, suggests that the quotation of Isaiah 61:1 is not a haftarah reading but the beginning of a sermon or homily, and suggests that the occasion was [[Yom Kippur]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
No one knows for certain the origins of reading the haftarah, but several theories have been put forth. The most common explanation, accepted by some traditional Jewish authorities is that in 168 BCE, when the [[Hanukkah#The story|Jews were under the rule]] of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], they were forbidden to [[Torah reading|read]] the Torah and made do with a substitute. When they were again able to read the Torah, they kept reading the ''haftarah'' as well. However this theory was not articulated before the 14th century, when it was suggested by Rabbi [[David Abudirham]],&lt;ref&gt;Sol Scharfstein, ''The Book of Haftarot for Shabbat, Festivals, and Fast Days'' (2006, NJ, [[KTAV Publ.]]) page 14;  Samuel N. Hoenig, "Haftarah-Sidrah: Mirror Images" in Michael A. Schmidman, ed., ''Turim: Studies in Jewish History and Literature Presented to Dr. Bernard Lander'' (2007, L.A., Touro College Press) vol.1, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; but this explanation has several weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah: Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md.: Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) pages 4-5. Among the reasons for doubting, ancient sources list many oppressive acts by Antiochus but none mentions this, the reading of Haftarot also dates from antiquity in places that Antiochus never ruled, and it seems doubtful that any anti-Jewish villain would be so punctilious as to forbid only the Mosaic books but permit the Prophetic books. Stephen Gabriel Rosenberg, ''The Haphtara Cycle'' (2000, NJ. Jason Aronson) page xxi, "But this [attribution to the Seleucid era] is a doubtful proposition as the Book of Maccabees tells us that the Jews were not permitted to even keep the Sabbath (I Macc. 1:45-50 and II Macc. 6:11) and that all scrolls of the Law were burnt (I Macc. 1:56). So ''all'' forms of Sabbath worship would have been prohibited in the Temple or outside of it.  Josephus in his version of the events adds that ''all'' sacred books of the Law were destroyed (''Antiquities'' XII:256). There is no reason to think therefore that the books of the ''Nevi'im'' [Prophets] would be allowed any more than the scrolls of the Law (Torah) themselves, and in any case it is hardly likely that such manuscripts were available to ordinary people." (emphasis in original).  Also, Jacob Mann, "Changes in the Divine Service of the Synagogue Due to Religious Persecutions", ''Hebrew Union College Annual'' vol. 4 (1927) pages 282-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation, offered by Rabbis [[Reuven Margolies]] and [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (except where otherwise identified, this is the Hirsch cited throughout this article),&amp;nbsp;is that the haftarah reading was instituted to fight the influence of those [[sects]] in Judaism that viewed the Hebrew Bible as consisting only of the Torah.

However, all offered explanations for the origin of reading the haftarah have unanswered difficulties.

Certainly the haftarah was read &amp;mdash; perhaps not obligatorily nor in all communities nor on every Sabbath — as far back as circa 70 CE: The Talmud mentions that a ''haftarah''&amp;nbsp;was read in the presence of Rabbi [[Eliezer ben Hyrcanus]], who lived at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah: Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md.: Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) pages 120-121, citing ''Megillah'' 25b. Oddly, the Talmudic story is that the Rabbi found fault with the choice of haftara - but that selection is still read as the haftara for another parsha.  Moreover, a study of the writings of Philo Judaeus, who died circa 50 CE, shows extensive reliance ("an overwhelming degree of correlation") on the same prophetic passages read as the haftarot for various special Sabbaths and holidays, which indicates that those haftarot were part of the liturgy decades earlier than the Talmud suggests; see Naomi G. Cohen, ''Philo's Scriptures: Citations from the Prophets and Writings, Evidence for a Haftarah Cycle in Second Temple Judaism'' (2007, Leiden, NL: E.J. Brill, ''Supplements to the Journal for the Study of Judaism'', vol. 123) page 69.  A fragment from the 11th or 12th century in Cairo lists a few haftarot not now in use -- but also shows that the Torah readings used were different from what is now virtually universal (e.g. one Torah portion is Numbers 25:1-10, but the ubiquitous practice for the past several centuries is that one Torah portion, ''Balak'', ends with verse 9, and the next week's, ''Pinchas'', begins with verse 10). E.N. Adler, "MS. of Haftaras of the Triennial Cycle", ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', vol. 8, nr. 3 (April 1896) page 529.&lt;/ref&gt;  The New Testament indicates that readings from the Prophets - but not necessarily a fixed schedule - was a common part of the Sabbath service (Luke 4:16-17; Act 13:15 &amp; 13:27) in Jerusalem synagogues even earlier than 70 CE.

==Who reads the ''haftarah''==
Only one person reads the haftarah portion.&lt;ref name="Ismar Elbogen 1913, page 146"&gt;Ismar Elbogen, ''Jewish Liturgy: A Comprehensive History'' (German 1913, English transl. 1993, Philadelphia, Jewish Publ'n Society) page 146.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from the procedure in Torah reading, wherein the text is divided into anywhere from three to seven portions, which may be read by one person or divided amongst several.

The haftarah is traditionally read by the ''[[maftir]]'', or the last person to be called up to the Torah scroll.

Traditions varied or evolved with regard to which person could read the haftarah.  As an indication that, perhaps to make clear that the haftarah reading was not the same status as the Torah reading, a minor (i.e., a boy not yet bar mitzvah age) was permitted to chant the haftarah (at least on an ordinary Sabbath), and there were even communities where the haftarah reading was reserved exclusively for minor boys.  In recent centuries, when the attainment of bar mitzvah age is celebrated with a distinct ceremony, the bar mitzvah boy (now an adult) will read the ''maftir''&amp;nbsp;portion and the haftarah.&lt;ref&gt;Macy Nulman, "The Liturgical and Musical Development and Significance of the Haftarah", ''Journal of Jewish Music &amp; Liturgy'', vol. 15 (1992) page 26; Ismar Elbogen, ''Jewish Liturgy: A Comprehensive History'' (German 1913, English transl. 1993, Philadelpha, Jewish Publ'n Society) page 146.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some other communities, the haftarah could only be read by one who had participated in the Torah reading (in some practices, the ''maftir'' - the last man to have read from the Torah), or even the whole congregation would read the haftarah to themselves from the available ''humashim'' - this evidently to avoid embarrassing a reader who might make a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Macy Nulman, "The Liturgical and Musical Development and Significance of the Haftarah", ''Journal of Jewish Music &amp; Liturgy'', vol. 15 (1992) pages 26-27; Ismar Elbogen, ''Jewish Liturgy: A Comprehensive History'' (German 1913, English transl. 1993, Philadelpha, Jewish Publ'n Society) page 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] (16th century) reported that for many years there were no set haftarot: the ''maftir'' chose an appropriate passage from the ''Nevi'im''.&lt;ref&gt;''Kesef Mishneh'', Laws of Tefillah 12:12&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, certain choices became established in certain communities; in contemporary Jewish observance one may not choose his or her own haftarah, explained Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], as that would run against accepted custom.&lt;ref&gt;''Igrot Moshe, Orah Hayim Simanin'' &amp;nbsp; 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Karo's explanation, however, helps to explain why communities have varying customs regarding what to read as haftarah.

==What form of the text is read==
Unlike the Torah portion, the haftarah is, nowadays, normally read from a printed book. This may be either a [[Tanakh]] (entire Hebrew Bible), a [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (or "Humash") (volume containing the Torah with haftarot) or, in the case of the festivals, the prayer book; there are also books containing the haftarot alone in large print.  Even when a scroll of haftarah readings is used, that scroll - unlike the Torah scroll - may be made of paper and may include such embellishments as the vowel points and ''trope.''&lt;ref&gt;Ismar Elbogen, ''Jewish Liturgy: A Comprehensive History'' (German 1913, English transl. 1993, Philadelpha, Jewish Publ'n Society) page 146.  The first printed Humash was published in Brescia, Italy, in 1492; [[Christian David Ginsburg|C. David Ginsburg]], Introduction to the Massoretico-Critical Editions of the Hebrew Bible (1897, London, Trinitarian Bible Soc.; reprinted 1966, NJ, [[KTAV Publ'g]]) pages 865-871 (its description as the ''first'' is in the index, page 1010, s.v. "Haphtaroth") - it was also the first Biblical publication of the famous [[Soncino family (printers)|Soncino family]] of Hebrew printers.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to most halakhic decisors (''posqim'' ), it is preferable to read the haftarah out of a parchment scroll, and according to a small minority of posqim (mainly the followers of the [[Vilna Gaon]]), such a parchment scroll is an absolute requirement. This may take various forms.
* According to some older traditions, the haftarot were read out of a special scroll containing just the selections of the Prophetic Books which were used in actual haftarot; this was known as a ''Sifra De'aftarta'' (ספרא דאפטרתא), and can still be found in a few communities today, both Ashkenazic and Sephardic; in some communities the scroll is made of paper. These scrolls sometimes contain [[Niqqud|vowel points]] and te`amim (cantillation signs), and sometimes do not. &lt;ref&gt;There was, in fact, a early opinion that scrolls of haftarah selections were forbidden because it was forbidden to write less than a complete Biblical book. cf. Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah: Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md.: Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) page 203 (citing [[Rashi]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
*However, the Vilna Gaon instituted that haftarot be read only from scrolls which contained the full text of a Prophetic Book (e.g., full text of Joshua, or full text of Judges, or full text of Isaiah), just as a Torah scroll contains the full text of the Pentateuch. These scrolls are written in accordance with the laws of writing Torah scrolls, and thus - in the opinion of the Vilna Gaon - do not contain vowel points or cantillation signs.&lt;ref&gt;See Binyomin Hamburger, ''Shorshei Minhag Ashkenaz'', volume III, chapter "Sifra De'aftarta"; &amp;nbsp; Ismar Elbogen, ''Jewish Liturgy: A Comprehensive History'' (German 1913, English transl. 1993, Philadelpha, Jewish Publ'n Society) page 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Such scrolls are used for the reading of the haftarot in many, perhaps most, Lithuanian-style [[yeshivot]], and in a number of Ashkenazic synagogues, especially in Israel.
*Some (few) Orthodox insist that a scroll of haftarot is not sufficient, nor the scroll of an individual prophetic book, but require a scroll of the entire Prophetic segment of the Bible (''Sefer Navi''), which is relatively uncommon (and would necessarily be much larger than a Torah scroll), although some would allow such a scroll to be written in ordinary ink or on ordinary paper (unlike Torah scrolls), and if such a scroll is unavailable the entire congregation must read the haftarah for themselves, silently or in a murmur, from books rather than the ''maftir'' reciting aloud from something other than a scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Ziegler, "Halachic Positions: Reading the Haftara", ''The Jewish Press, 20 March 1998; Hershel Schachter, "Lesser-Known Laws of Torah Reading", ''Journal of Jewish Music and Liturgy'', vol. 7 (1984) page 7; Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah: Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md.: Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) page 199
&lt;/ref&gt;

It would seem that the initial resistance to using a printed book has diminished as the technology of printing, and therefore the accuracy and characteristics of the printed books, has improved.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah: Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md.: Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) chap. 38, pages 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were opinions that a haftarah scroll should not be stored in the [[Torah Ark|holy ark]], but other opinions (such as Rabbi [[Ovadiah Yosef]]) were that it was permitted&lt;ref&gt; Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah: Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md.: Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) page 210.&lt;/ref&gt;; however the haftarah scroll is not decorated in the manner of the Torah scrolls but may be given distinctive (and inferior, such as copper) decorations.&lt;ref&gt; Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah: Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md.: Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) page 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blessings and customs==
Blessings both precede and follow the haftarah reading. These blessings are derived from the minor (and uncanonical) Talmudic tractate ''[[Soferim (Talmud)|Massekhet Soferim]]'' - also called, simply, ''Soferim'', which dates back to the 7th or 8th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph H. Hertz, ''The Authorised Daily Prayer Book (NYC: Bloch Publ'g Co., rev.ed. 1948) page 497. A.Z. Idelsohn, ''Jewish Liturgy and Its Development (NY: Henry Holt, 1932, reprinted NY: Dover Publ'ns, 1995) page 140, citing ''Soferim'' 13:9-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  But it is possible that these blessings, or at least some of them, date from before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Macy Nulman, "The Liturgical and Musical Development and Significance of the Haftarah", ''Journal of Jewish Music and Liturgy'', vol. 15 (1992) page p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;  At least some haftarah blessings were in use by the second century (Talmud Babli, ''Shabbat'' 24a). The blessings are read by the person designated to read the haftarah portion; the blessing before the haftarah is read in the tune of the haftarah. The Sephardic practice is to recite, immediately after the text of the haftarah and before the concluding blessings, the verse of Isaiah 47:4 ("Our Redeemer! The Lord of Hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel!"). The blessings following the haftarah are standard on all occasions the haftarah is read, except for the final blessing, which varies by date and is omitted on some days.

There are five blessings, one before, and the others after, the haftarah reading.  These blessings may go back as far as the haftarah ritual itself.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold S. Rosenberg, ''Jewish Liturgy as a Spiritual System'' (2000, NJ: Jason Aronson) page 127; Macy Nulman, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ: Jason Aronson) s.v. "Birkhot Hahaftarah" page 113.&lt;/ref&gt;  It will be immediately noticed that the haftarah has more, and longer, blessings than the reading of the Torah itself; it is plausible that the reading from the Prophets was given this distinction in order to emphasize the sacred nature of the Prophetic books in the face of Samaritan rejection.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard S. Jacobson, ''The Sabbath Service: An exposition and analysis of its structure, contents, language and ideas'' (Hebrew 1968, Engl. transl. 1981, Tel-Aviv, Sinai Publ'g) pages 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt;   If the haftarah is read by the ''maftir'', then he had already recited two blessings for the Torah reading and the five haftarah blessings means he has recited a total of the significant number of seven blessings.&lt;ref&gt;Macy Nulman, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ: Jason Aronson) s.v. "Birkhot Hahaftarah" page 113; Macy Nulman, "The Liturgical and Musical Development and Significance of the Haftarah", ''Journal of Jewish Music and Liturgy'', vol. 15 (1992) page 27; Bernhard S. Jacobson, ''The Sabbath Service: An exposition and analysis of its structure, contents, language and ideas'' (Hebrew 1968, Engl. transl. 1981, Tel-Aviv, Sinai Publ'g) page 270.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first blessing is not recited until the Torah scroll has been rolled shut.&lt;ref&gt;Ismar Elbogen, ''Jewish Liturgy: A Comprehensive History'' (German 1913, English transl. 1993, Philadelpha, Jewish Publ'n Society) pages 143 and 146 (citing ''Sotah'' 39b); Macy Nulman, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ: Jason Aronson) s.v. "Birkhot Hahaftarah" page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; And, similarly, the haftarah text itself - whether a book or a scroll - remains open on the lectern until after the final haftarah blessing is concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Macy Nulman, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ: Jason Aronson) s.v. "Birkhot Hahaftarah" page 114; Macy Nulman, "The Liturgical and Musical Development and Significance of the Haftarah", ''Journal of Jewish Music and Liturgy'', vol. 15 (1992) page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The blessings have changed but only a little over the centuries, the current text apparently coming from the late 11th century ''[[Machzor Vitry]]'', with slight differences from the texts perpetuated in the tractate [[Soferim|Massekhet Soferim]] (possibly 7th or 8th century), and the writings of [[Maimonides]], dating back to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard S. Jacobson, ''The Sabbath Service: An exposition and analysis of its structure, contents, language and ideas'' (Hebrew 1968, Engl. transl. 1981, Tel-Aviv, Sinai Publ'g) pages 270-280. Mentions of variants in the blessings are from this reference and from Macy Nulman, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ: Jason Aronson) s.v. "Birkhot Hahaftarah" pages 112-115, and Ismar Elbogen, ''Jewish Liturgy: A Comprehensive History'' (German 1913, English transl. 1993, Philadelpha, Jewish Publ'n Society) pages 147-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first blessing, chanted before the haftarah portion read, uses the same melody as the haftarah chant itself, also in minor mode. For this reason, many prayerbooks print this first blessing with the cantillation marks used in the Bible itself for the books of the Prophets, possibly the only instance of a non-biblical text to be equipped with such marks.&lt;ref name="Macy Nulman 1992 page 30"&gt;Macy Nulman, "The Liturgical and Musical Development and Significance of the Haftarah", ''Journal of Jewish Music and Liturgy'', vol. 15 (1992) page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  This initial blessing is only two verses, but both begin with blessing God, yet are not interrupted by an intervening Amen.

The blessings are as follows:  The '''first blessing''' precedes the reading:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Blessed are you, ''Lord'' &amp;nbsp; [YHVH], our God, King of the universe,
Who has chosen good prophets,
And was pleased with their words spoken in truth.

Blessed are you, ''Lord'', who has chosen the Torah, and his servant Moses, 
And his people Israel,
And the prophets of truth and righteousness.
:::[''congregation'': Amen.]
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is a somewhat free translation from the very poetic Hebrew text which is the same in both Ashkenazic and Sephardic prayerbooks.  This first blessing is straight from the minor tractate [[Soferim (Talmud)|Massekhet Soferim]], chapter 13, paragraph 7.  The first verse praises God, "who has chosen good prophets" (presumably distinguished from false prophets not called by God), the second verse is one of the few places in the Sabbath liturgy that mentions Moses, also chosen by God as were the prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold S. Rosenberg, ''Jewish Liturgy as a Spiritual System'' (2000, NJ: Jason Aronson) page 129; Macy Nulman, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ: Jason Aronson) s.v. "Birkhot Hahaftarah" page 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, 'Israel' means world Jewry wherever they may be.

Immediately after the last word of the haftarah has been read, many Sefardic, Mizrahi, and Italic congregations traditionally recite two Bible verses, which are then repeated by the maftir:&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Benisch, ''The Pentateuch and the Haftaroth, newly translated'' (Rodelheim, 2nd ed. 1864) vol.1, Genesis page 227, Exodus page 195, etc.; Macy Nulman, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ: Jason Aronson) s.v. "Birkhot Hahaftarah" page 113; Rabbi Eliezer Toledano, The Orot Sephardic Shabbat Siddur ("Siddur Kol Sassoon")(Lakewood, NJ, Orot, 1995) page 434.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Our Redeemer - ''the Lord'' &amp;nbsp; of Hosts is his name - the holy one of Israel. &amp;nbsp; [Isaiah 47:4]
Blessed be ''the Lord'' &amp;nbsp; forever. Amen and Amen. &amp;nbsp; [Psalm 89:53] &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The blessings that follow the reading of the haftarah are chanted in the pentatonic scale.&lt;ref name="Macy Nulman 1992 page 30"/&gt;

The '''second blessing''' follows the end of the Prophetic reading:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Blessed are you, ''Lord'', our God, King of the universe,
Rock of all the worlds, righteous through all eras,
The trustworthy God, who says and does, who speaks and fulfills,
For all his words are true and just.

Trustworthy are you, ''Lord'', and trustworthy are your words,
And not a single one of your words is recalled as unfulfilled,
Because you are God, king, trustworthy.
Blessed are you ''Lord'', the God who is trustworthy in all his words.
:::[''congregation'': Amen.]
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Again, this is straight from [[Soferim (Talmud)|Massekhet Soferim]], paragraphs 8 and 10; Paragraph 9 set out a congregational response which seems not to have been adopted; after the first verse the congregation would rise and say "Faithful are you ''Lord''  our God, and trustworthy are your words. O faithful, living, and enduring, may you constantly rule over us forever and ever."  This response apparently was in use in antiquity - the Jews of the eastern diaspora would recite this while seated, the Jews of Eretz Yisrael would stand.  This practice appears to have ceased during the Middle Ages (it is not in Amram's prayerbook of the 9th century although a phrase of it ["Trustworthy are you ''Lord''  our God, living and enduring forever", right after "words are true and just"] is in the ''Mahzor Vitry '',  (ca. 1100), but in the 18th century Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] criticized its omission.  The second half of the blessing echoes Isaiah 45:23 and 55:11.
 
The '''third blessing''' follows immediately:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Be merciful to Zion, because it is the home of our life, 
And save the downtrodden soon, in our own days.
Blessed are you ''Lord'', who makes glad the children of Zion [''or'' &amp;nbsp; makes Zion to rejoice in her children].
:::[''congregation'': Amen.]
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Very similar to [[Soferim (Talmud)|Massekhet Soferim]], paragraph 11, which begins "Comfort &amp;nbsp; [''Naham'', instead of ''rahaym'' ], ''Lord'' &amp;nbsp;our God, Zion your city..." &amp;nbsp; and ends "who comforts the children of Zion."  Zion means Mount Zion, the hill in Jerusalem on which the Temple stood, although it had been destroyed centuries before this blessing was composed.  It is possible that Mount Zion is mentioned deliberately to refute the Samaritans, who centered their devotion to [[Mount Gerizim]] instead of Mount Zion.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard S. Jacobson, ''The Sabbath Service: An exposition and analysis of its structure, contents, language and ideas'' (Hebrew 1968, Engl. transl. 1981, Tel-Aviv, Sinai Publ'g) page 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of "save" the downtrodden, Massekhet Soferim has "avenge" &amp;nbsp; [''tenikum '',  instead of ''toshiya'' ], which is used in the Yemenite version of the blessing. By the time of [[Amram Gaon]] (9th century) and [[Saadiah Gaon]] (10th century), as well as the ''Mahzor Vitry''  (ca. 1100), 'be merciful' had replaced 'comfort' - but 'avenge' was still part of the text—and into the last century was still part of both Romaniot and Yemenite versions. It has been suggested that "save"  replaced "avenge"  in so many communities because of Christian and Moslem censorship or intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard S. Jacobson, ''The Sabbath Service: An exposition and analysis of its structure, contents, language and ideas'' (Hebrew 1968, Engl. transl. 1981, Tel-Aviv, Sinai Publ'g) page 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fourth blessing''' follows immediately:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Make us glad, ''Lord'' &amp;nbsp;our God,
with the Prophet Elijah, your servant,
and with the kingdom of the house of David, your anointed,
May he arrive soon and bring joy to our hearts.
Let no stranger sit upon his throne, 
Nor let others continue to usurp his glory.
For you swore by your holy name that through all eternity his lamp will never go dark.
Blessed are you ''Lord'',  shield of David.
:::[''congregation'':  Amen.]
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is virtually identical to the text in [[Soferim (Talmud)|Massekhet Soferim]], paragraph 12, until the last line.  Before the second "Blessed are you", Soferim contains this line (quoting Jeremiah 23:6): "And in his days may Judah be made safe, and Israel to dwell securely, and he shall be called, '''the Lord'' &amp;nbsp; is our vindicator'." &amp;nbsp; This line remained in Romaniot liturgy.  Instead of "Shield of David", Soferim has "who brings to fruition the mighty salvation of his people Israel."  But by the 3rd century, "shield of David" was the text in use (Talmud Babli, ''Pesachim'' 117b), predating Soferim.&lt;br&gt;The lines "let no stranger sit on his throne" and "others continue to usurp his glory" might date back to the earliest Talmudic times, when the Hasmoneans and Herodians, rather than true descendants of the royal house of David, were rulers of the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph H. Hertz, ''The Authorised Daily Prayer Book (NYC: Bloch Publ'g Co., rev.ed. 1948) page 497.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fifth (final) blessing''' follows immediately and is a bit longer than the previous one:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For the Torah reading, and for the worship service, and for [the reading from] the Prophets,
And for this Sabbath day [''or'' &amp;nbsp; for this (''holiday''  )], which you have given us, ''Lord''  our God,
For holiness and for respite, for honor and for splendor,
For all of this, ''Lord''  our God, 
We gratefully thank you, and bless you.
May your name be blessed by every living mouth,
Always and forever.
Blessed are you ''Lord'', who sanctifies the Sabbath.
:::[''congregation'': Amen.] 
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is from paragraph 13 of Soferim, which does not contain the phrase "by every living mouth", and which concludes with "who sanctifies ''Israel and the Day of whatever '' "  (this last word to be replaced by the proper name of the holy occasion).  Amram Gaon and Maimonides concluded with "who rebuilds Jerusalem," but this appears to have been discarded by all factions. This final blessing is modified for the various festivals and holidays.&lt;ref&gt;Macy Nulman, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ: Jason Aronson) s.v. "Birkhot Hahaftarah" pages 113-114;  Joseph H. Hertz, ''The Authorized Daily Prayer Book'' (rev. ed., 1948, NYC, Bloch Pub'g) pages 496-501;  Nosson Scherman, ed., ''The Stone Edition Tanach'' (1996, Brooklyn, Mesorah Pub'ns) pages xxiv-xxv; Nosson Scherman &amp; Meir Zlotowitz, ''Siddur Imrei Ephraim - The Complete ArtScroll Siddur - Nusach Sefard'' (1985, Brooklyn, Mesorah Pub'ns) pages 486-487.&lt;/ref&gt;  In all traditions that last phrase, "who sanctifies the Sabbath", is replaced by the appropriate substitute when the occasion is something other than an ordinary Sabbath, if a holiday falling on a Sabbath the phrasing is "And for this Sabbath day and for this day of this...." (if not on a Sabbath, then merely "and for this day of ..."); e.g. (for Passover) "Festival of Matzos", (on Shavuous) "Festival of Shavuous", (on Succos) "Festival of Succos, (on Shemini Atzeres or Simhas Torah) "Festival of the Assembly", (on Rosh Hashana) "Day of Remembrance", (on Yom Kippur) "Day of Atonement", - but it appears from [[Kol Bo]] (14th century) that Yom Kippur is the only fast day with a name and therefore this final blessing is not recited at all on other fast days, such as Gedaliah or Esther or Tisha B'Av, since they have no such names that can be inserted into the blessing&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah: Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md.: Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) pages 164-165.&lt;/ref&gt; - and then the festival version of the blessing concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
 "... that you, ''Lord''  our God, have given us [(''on Sabbaths'') &amp;nbsp; for holiness and respite,] 
 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  for gladness and joy [''on Yom Kippur this is replaced with'' : &amp;nbsp; for pardon, forgiveness, and atonement],
 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  for honor and splendor.
For all this ''Lord''  our God we thank you and praise you. 
May your name be blessed by every living mouth, always and forever. 
Blessed are you ''Lord'', who sanctifies [the Sabbath and] Israel and the Festivals."
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''And on Yom Kippur, replace the last line with'' :
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Blessed are you ''Lord'', 
 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; the King who pardons and forgives our sins and the sins of his people, the family of Israel, 
 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  and who removes our iniquities year after year,
King over all the earth, who sanctifies [the Sabbath,]  Israel, and the Day of Atonement.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ancient times the haftarah, like the Torah, was [[Targum|translated into Aramaic]] as it was read, and this is still done by [[Yemenite Jews]]. The Talmud lays down that, while the Torah must be translated verse by verse, it is permissible to translate other readings (such as the Haftarah) in units of up to three verses at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Mishna, Megilla 4:4, 4th sentence.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some generalities have been drawn from the haftarah choices, but they have exceptions.  For example, that the haftarot have something in common, or some relevancy, with the Torah reading.  But, for example, the relevance for the parsha ''Bamidbar'' &amp;nbsp; (Numbers 1:1-4:20) is the one word, "wilderness", in Hosea 12:16 (and, of course, the haftarot for special Sabbaths and holidays do not require any relation to the Torah reading for that week).  Or, that the haftarah should be at least 21 verses in length, to match the minimal Torah reading (see Talmud Babli, ''Megilla'' 23a &amp; 23b, which mentions this as a doubtful requirement), but, e.g., the haftarah for ''Ki Teitzei'' &amp;nbsp; (Deuteronomy 21:10-25:19) is, for Ashkenazim and Sephardim, only 10 verses; and the haftarah for ''Miketz'' &amp;nbsp; (Genesis 41:1-44:17) is, for Ashkenazim and Sephardim only 15 verses, and for Italic Jews only 14 verses.  The [[Tosefta]] mentions a haftarah in antiquity (before the 2nd century C.E.) that was just one verse, namely Isaiah 52:3, and some others that were only four or five verses.&lt;ref&gt;Ismar Elbogen, ''Jewish Liturgy: A Comprehensive History'' (German 1913, English transl. 1993, Philadelpha, Jewish Publ'n Society) page 145; Arnold S. Rosenberg, ''Jewish Liturgy as a Spiritual System'' (2000, NJ: Jason Aronson) page 127. The Tosefta mention is in ''Megillah'' 4:18.&lt;/ref&gt;   Another, that the haftarah reading should not end on a macabre or distressing verse, and therefore either the penultimate verse is repeated at the very end or else verses from elsewhere (sometimes even from different prophetic books) are used as a coda, such as with the haftarah for ''Tzav'' &amp;nbsp; (Leviticus 6:1-8:36) (Ashkenazim and Sephardim skip ahead in the same prophet to avoid concluding with the description of the dire fate of the wicked, a total of 19 verses; Chabad and Yemenite also skip ahead to avoid concluding with a different disquieting verse, a total of 16 verses; Karaites and Romaniote go back and repeat the penultimate verse, promising the reappearance of Elijah, rather than end with the word "desolation" - and the same applies when everyone else reads the same passage on ''Shabbat Hagadol'' ). Among the consistent characteristics is that entire verses are read; never is only a part of a verse read.

In antiquity there was no prescribed list of haftarah readings for the year, although the Talmudic literature (including the Midrash and Tosefta) does report some recommendations for specific holidays.  It would appear that, in antiquity, the choice of portion from the Prophets was made ''ad hoc'', without regard for the choice of previous years or of other congregations, either by the reader or by the congregation or its leaders;  this is evidenced by recommendations in Talmudic literature that certain passages should not be chosen for haftarah readings, which indicates that, to that time, that a regular list for the year's readings did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Büchler, "The Reading of the Law and Prophets in a Triennial Cycle (part ii)"  ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', vol. 6, nr. 1 (Oct. 1893) page 2 (citing the Mishna of ''Megilla'' iv, 10, which discourages the use of 2nd Samuel, chap. 13 - the rape of Tamar - and Ezekiel, chap. 1 - the vision of the heavenly chariot. Also, Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah: Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md.: Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) pages 117-123.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further evidence of the lack of an ancient authoritative list of readings is the simple fact that, while the practice of reading a haftarah every Sabbath and most holy days is ubiquitous, the different traditions and communities around the world have by now adopted differing lists, indicating that no solid tradition from antiquity dictated the haftarah selections for a majority of the ordinary Sabbaths.&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Adolf Büchler, "The Reading of the Law and Prophets in a Triennial Cycle (part i)"  ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', vol. 5, nr. 31 (April 1892) pages 420-468 and "part ii)" (Oct. 1893) pages 1-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cantillation==
The ''haftarah'' is read with [[cantillation]] according to a unique melody (not with the same [[cantillation]] melody as the Torah). The tradition to read ''Nevi'im'' with its own special melody is attested to in late medieval sources, both [[Ashkenazic]] and [[Sephardic]]. A medieval Sephardic source notes that the melody for the ''haftarot'' is a slight variation of the tune used for reading the books of [[Nevi'im]] in general (presumably for study purposes), and Jews of Iraqi origin to this day preserve separate "Neviim" and "Haftarah" melodies.

Note that although many selections from [[Nevi'im]] are read as ''haftarot'' over the course of the year, the books of [[Nevi'im]] are ''not'' read in their entirety (as opposed to the Torah). Since [[Nevi'im]] as a whole is not covered in the liturgy, the melodies for certain rare [[cantillation]] notes which appear in the books of [[Nevi'im]] but not in the ''haftarot'' have been forgotten. For more on this, see [[Nevi'im]].

As a generality, although the Torah was chanted in a major key (ending in a minor key), the haftarah is chanted in a minor key (as is the blessing before the reading of the haftarah) and ends in a pentatonic mode (and the blessings following the haftarah reading are also pentatonic).&lt;ref&gt;Macy Nulman, "The Liturgical and Musical Development and Significance of the Haftarah", ''Journal of Jewish Music &amp; Liturgy'', vol. 15 (1992) pages 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haftarot for the morning of Tisha b'Av, and for the Shabbat preceding it, are, in many synagogues, predominantly read to the [[cantillation]] melody used for the public reading of the [[Book of Lamentations]], or ''Eicha.''

[[Leonard Bernstein]] employed the Haftarah cantillation melody extensively as a theme in the second movement ("Profanation") of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Bernstein)|Symphony No. 1 ("Jeremiah")]].

==On Sabbath afternoon==
Some [[Rishonim]], including ''[[Rabbenu]]'' [[Rabbenu Tam|Yaakov Tam]], report that a custom in the era of the [[Talmud]] was to read a haftarah at the ''[[mincha]]'' service each [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] afternoon &amp;mdash; but that this haftarah was from the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' rather than from the ''[[Nevi'im]]''. Most [[halachic]] authorities maintain that that was not the custom in Talmudic times, and that such a custom should not be followed. In the era of the [[Geonim]], some communities, including some in [[Persian Empire|Persia]], read a passage from ''Nevi'im'' (whether or not in the form of a haftarah) Sabbath afternoons.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, ''Geonica'', vol. 2 p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this practice is virtually defunct, most halachic authorities maintain that there is nothing wrong with it.

Rabbi [[Reuven Margolies]] claims that the now-widespread custom of individuals' reciting [[Psalm]] 111 after the Torah reading Sabbath afternoon derives from the custom reported by ''Rabbenu'' Tam. [[Louis Ginzberg]] makes the analogous claim for the custom of reciting Psalm 91 in ''Motza'ei Shabbat''.

==As a ''B'nai Mitzvah''   ritual==
In many communities the ''haftarah'' is read by a Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah at his or her respective ceremonies, along with some, all, or, sometimes none of the Torah portion. This is often referred to, mainly in [[Hebrew school]]s and ''bar''   preparatory programs, as a ''haftarah portion''.

The reading of the ''haftarah'' by the Bar Mitzvah is a relatively new custom, since it is not derived from either Bible nor Talmud.  According to the Talmud, the lesson from the Prophets may be read by a minor (i.e., a boy younger than 13), if he is sufficiently educated to do it.  A tradition that might have dated back to medieval times was that a boy would read the ''haftarah'' on the Sabbath ''prior'' to his Bar Mitzvah, and on the day of his Bar Mitzvah read the portion from the Torah but not the ''haftarah''; this custom changed, in the United States, in the late 19th century or early 20th century, when the Bar Mitzvah would read both the Torah and ''haftarah'' on the Sabbath immediately following his 13th birthday. The custom of the Bar Mitzvah reading the ''haftarah'' is so recent that the appropriate procedure for a ''haftarah'' reading when two boys are Bar Mitzvah on the same day is still unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Katz, ''The Haftarah - Laws, Customs &amp; History'' (2000, Silver Spring, Md., Hamaayan/The Torah Spring) chapter 4, pages 54-58. &lt;/ref&gt;

==List of ''Haftarot''==
The selections of haftarot readings for the various weeks, and holy days, of the year differs from tradition to tradition - Ashkenazic from Sefardic from Yemenite from Mizrachi, etc.  And even within a tradition there is no one authoritative list, but a multitude of different lists from different communities and congregations, usually differing from each other by only one or two haftarot.  A study of the antiquity of each of these lists, and how they differ from each other, is beyond the scope of this (or any other brief) article but may be most informative on the history (including the contacts and separations) of the various communities.&lt;ref&gt;David E. S. Stein, "The Haftarot of Etz Hayim", ''Conservative Judaism''  vol.54 nr.3 (spring 2002)([http://www.scholar.davidesstein.name/Articles/HaftarotOfEtzHayim--Stein.pdf reprint] pages 5-12 and the accompanying notes).&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection from ''[[Nevi'im]]'' [the Prophets] read as the ''haftarah'' is not always the same in all Jewish communities. When customs differ, this list indicates them as follows: ''A''=[[Ashkenazic]] custom (''AF''=[[Frankfurt am Main]]; ''AH''=[[Chabad]]; ''AP''= [[Polin|Poland]]); ''I''=[[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] custom; ''S''=[[Sephardic]] and [[Mizrahi]] custom (''SM''=[[Maghreb]] [North Africa]; ''SZ''= [[Mizrahi]] [Middle and Far East]); ''Y''=[[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] custom; ''R''=[[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] (Byzantine, eastern Roman empire, extinct)&lt;ref&gt;"The prophetic readings of the Byzantine ritual differed fundamentally from those of the other Rabbanite Jews of the diaspora.  They have been preserved in the editions of the haftarot published with the Commentary of David Kimchi in Constantinople, 1505; and in the edition of the Pentateuch and haftarot, published in Constantinople, 1522" (and theorizing the Romaniote readings were a perpetuation of the selections of early medieval Eretz Yisrael).  Louis Finkelstein, "The Prophetic Readings According to the Palestinian, Byzantine, and Karaite Rites", ''Hebrew Union College Annual'', vol. 17 (1942-1943) page 423; Adolf Büchler, "The Reading of the Law and Prophets in a Triennial Cycle (part ii)" ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', vol. 6, nr. 1 (Oct. 1893) pages 1-73, discusses in some detail evidence of very early choices of haftarot, particularly of the Karaites.&lt;/ref&gt; custom; and ''K''=[[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] custom.  In some instances ''Isr.Wikip'' = the Israeli version of Wikipedia (in Hebrew) of this article had different readings in its list.  In several instances, authorities did not agree on the readings of various communities.&lt;ref&gt;Among the authorities used were editions of ''humashim''
by: [[Joseph H. Hertz]],(1937, 2nd ed. 1960 [the second edition added several holiday haftarot, probably on the authority of someone other than Hertz (see article on Etz Hayim by Stein)], London, Soncino Press)(cited as "Hertz"; [[Nosson Scherman]], ''The Stone Edition'' (1993, Brooklyn, Mesorah Publ'ns, the [[ArtScroll]] Series)(cited as "ArtScroll"); [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], ''T'rumatch Tzvi'', one-volume edition (1990, NY, Judaica Press)(cited as "Hirsch"); and lists appearing in editions of the Bible, including ''[[Jerusalem Crown]]:  The Bible of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem'' (2000, Jerusalem)(cited as "Jerusalem Crown"); [[Umberto Cassuto]] (1969, Hebrew Univ. in Jerusalem)(cited as "Cassuto"); [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem|Koren Publishers]] (2006, Jerusalem)(cited as "Koren"); Elias Hiam Lindo, ''A Jewish Calendar for 64 Years [1838-1902]'' (London, 1838)(cited as "Lindo", sets forth the 1838 list of major Sephardic and Ashkenazic ("German") London congregations, his end verse numbers are invariably a verse beyond all the other sources so it appears that his end verse number is excluded rather than included. Lindo does not set forth any of the Special/Festival occasions nor the combined parshot); Bible Society in Israel (1991, Jerusalem)(cited as "Isr. Bible Soc."; Aron Dotan, ''Biblia Hebraica Leningradensia'' (2001, Massachusetts, Hendrickson Publ'rs)(cited as "Dotan"); also by Aron Dotan, the Bible published for the chaplains and troops of the Israeli Defense Forces (1973, Tel Aviv)(cited as ''IDF''); Jewish Publication Society translations in English (generally as "JPS"; specifically, the [[Jewish Publication Society of America Version|''American Jewish Version'']] cited as "JPS1917", and the [[JPS Tanakh|JPS ''Tanakh'']] cited as "JPS1985"); [[Abraham Benisch]], ''The Pentateuch and the Haftaroth, newly translated'' (Rodelheim, 2nd ed. 1864)(cited as "Benisch"); Rabbinical Assembly, United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism (organization formerly known as United Synagagues of America), ''Etz Hayim:  Torah and Commentary'' (2001, Phil., Jewish Publ'n Society)(cited as "SCJ"; see article on Etz Hayim by Stein).  And, of course, the very extensive list published as an appendix to volume 10 of the ''Encyclopedia Talmudit'' (1961, Tel Aviv) cols. 701-728.  The 1854 book, ''A Jewish Calendar for Fifty Years from A.M. 5614 till A.M. 5664 [Sept 1853 to Sept 1904]'' by Jacques J. Lyons and Abraham De Sola (rabbis of similarly named synagogues, respectively Ashkenazic in New York and Sephardic in Montreal), which provided lists identified as the "German" and "Portuguese" custom, presumably the practice in their own congregations (cited as "Lyons"). All of these provided both Ashkenazic and Sephardic lists; Yemenite lists were provided in Koren, Cassuto, Jerusalem Crown, IDF; Italic lists were provided in Cassuto, Dotan; Mahgreb, Frankfurt-on-Main, and some others were provided in Hirsch, Dotan; the Encyclopedia Talmudit provided all of these and some others, citing more than a dozen sources. The Hebrew language version of this Wikipedia article, worked up by an Israeli team, as it read in the Spring of 2014 was also used (cited as "Isr.Wikip."). It is very probable that various lists represent the practices only temporarily favored, perhaps more than century ago, by only a few or even one congregation, possibly under the leadership of a particular rabbi or while using a particular humash then available, and therefore the lists were subject to change and might well have changed and changed again in the intervening decades. No two lists were entirely the same, and compiling such lists required different materials and expertise than used to edit or comment on the Bible.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because, in the Diaspora, certain holy days and festivals are observed for an additional day, which day is not so observed in Eretz Yisrael, sometimes different haftarot are read simultaneously inside and outside Eretz Yisrael.

===[[Special Sabbaths]], festivals, and fast days===
In general, on the dates below, the haftarot below are read, even if that entails overriding the haftarah &lt;br&gt; for a Sabbath Torah portion. However, in certain communities, the first two haftarot below &lt;br&gt; (that for Rosh Hodesh and that for the day preceding Rosh Hodesh) are replaced by the regular &lt;br&gt; weekly haftarah when the weekly reading is ''Masei'' &amp;nbsp; (occurring in mid-summer) or later.&lt;br&gt; Some of these occasions also have specific Torah readings, which (for A and S) are noted parenthetically. &lt;br&gt;

*Sabbath coinciding with [[Rosh Hodesh]] (new moon, the beginning of a month), except Rosh Hodesh of the months&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; of Adar, Nisan, Tevet, or (in some communities) Av or Elul; and except Rosh Hashanah &lt;br&gt;(Torah reading:  Numbers 28:9-15, acc to JPS, Hirsch, Soncino Chumash; Numbers 28:1-15, acc to Hertz, ArtScroll)

*Sabbath coinciding with the day preceding [[Rosh Chodesh|Rosh Hodesh]], &amp;nbsp; (known as ''[[Shabbat Mevarchim|Machar Hodesh]]'' ), &amp;nbsp; except &lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  Rosh Hodesh of the months of [[Nisan]], [[Tevet]], [[Adar]], or (in most communities) [[Elul]] and except [[Rosh Hashanah]]

**Hosea 14:2-10. Also, some communities add either Joel 2:15 (or 2:11)&amp;ndash;27 or Micah 7:18&amp;ndash;20.&lt;br&gt; Hirsch says, because the Hosea reading ends on a sad note, A added the passage from Joel, S added&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  the one from Micah. However, many communities nowadays add both these passages.

**The choice of the reading from Hosea is almost universal because its opening words are ''Shuvah Yisrael'' - "Return, O Israel, to ''the Lord'' &amp;nbsp; your God". &lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; "Some few congregations" (acc to ArtScroll) read Isaiah 55:6&amp;ndash;56:8 (the haftarah associated with Vayelech and with the [[minchah]] of fast&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; days) instead. &amp;nbsp; (Some lists or books have no specific entry for Shabbat Shuva, leading to the supposition that the haftarah usually&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; associated with the week's parsha - usually Vayelech - is to be read; and some apply a more complex exchange of haftarot if there is - as&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; often occurs - a Sabbath in the four days between Yom Kippur and the beginning of ''Sukkot'';in which case that Sabbath is Parsha Haazinu.)&lt;ref&gt;Menahem Ben-Yashar, ''The Haftarah Readings of Shabbat (Te)shuvah'', Bar-Ilan University's Parashot Hashavua Study Center, Rosh Hashana 5768 (Sept. 2007) http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/rosh/eny.html; and Rabbi Mosheh Lichtenstein, ''Shabbat Shuva'', the Israel Koschitzky Virtual Beit Midrash, http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/haftara/54shuva.htm.

===For a bridegroom===
It was customary in many communities to read Isaiah 61:10 - 62:8 &amp;nbsp;(Italic would read 61:9 - 62:9) &amp;nbsp; if a bridegroom (who had married within the previous week) was present in the synagogue.&lt;br&gt;
Customs varied:
* In some communities, this entire haftarah was read, supplanting the usual haftarah of that week.
* In some communities, only a few verses (possibly Isaiah 61:10 - 62:5, although the literature is unclear) were read. They were&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; read ''after''  the usual haftarah, either before or after &amp;mdash; depending on local custom &amp;mdash; the closing blessings of the haftarah.

When a [[Talmud]]ically specified haftarah was to be read on a certain Sabbath (e.g., on Sabbath of [[Hanukkah]]), some communities &lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;did not read the bridegroom's haftarah, preferring to keep to the standard haftarah of the week. Again, customs varied:
* In some communities, the bridegroom's haftarah was read.
* Some communities, even though they normally read the entire bridegroom's haftarah for a bridegroom, now merely appended a few verses of it to the weekly haftarah.
* Some communities omitted the bridegroom's haftarah altogether, reading the weekly haftarah instead.
Nowadays, this custom has virtually disappeared. No one reads a special haftarah for a bridegroom any longer, except the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] and perhaps intensely Orthodox congregations.

'''The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor''' was an initiatic [[occultism|occult]] organisation that first became public in late 1894, although according to an official document of the order&lt;ref&gt;Godwin,Chanel,Deveney, 1995, pages 92-97&lt;/ref&gt; it began its work in 1870.  According to this document, authored by Peter Davidson, the order was established by [[Max Theon]], who when in England was [[initiation|initiated]] as a [[wikt:neophyte|Neophyte]] by "an adept of the serene, ever-existing and ancient Order of the original H. B. of L."&lt;ref&gt;Godwin,Chanel,Deveney, 1995, page 95&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Order's relation, if any, with the mysterious "Brotherhood of Luxor" that [[Helena Blavatsky]] spoke of is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin,Chanel,Deveney, 1995, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Theon thus became Grand Master of the Exterior Circle of the Order. However, apart from his initiatory role, he seems to have little to do with the day to day running of the order, or of its teachings. He seems to have left these things to Peter Davidson, who was the Provincial Grand Master of the North (Scotland), and later also the Eastern Section (America). 

The order's teachings drew heavily from the magico-sexual theories of [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], who influenced groups such as the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.) (later headed by [[Aleister Crowley]]) (Greenfield 1997) although it is not clear whether or not Randolph himself was actually a part of the Order.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin,Chanel,Deveney, 1995, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the rise of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] in 1888 the HBoL was the only order that taught [[practical occultism]] in the [[Western Mystery Tradition]]. Among its members were a number of occultists, [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualists]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]]. Initial relations between the Order and the [[Theosophical Society]] were cordial, with most members of the order also prominent members of the T.S.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin,Chanel,Deveney, 1995, page 52&lt;/ref&gt;  

Later there was a falling out, as the Order was opposed to the eastern-based teachings of the later Blavatsky (Davidson considered that Blavatsky had fallen under the influence of "a greatly inferior Order, belonging to the Budhist [sic] Cult"). Conversely, the conviction in 1883 of the Secretary of the Order, [[Thomas Henry Burgoyne]] for fraud, was claimed by the Theosophists to show the immorality of the Order.

'''Hong Xiuquan''' (洪秀全) (1 January 1814&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 10 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash;  1 June 1864), born '''Hong Huoxiu''' and with the [[courtesy name]] '''Renkun''', was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[Chinese people|Chinese]] leader of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] against the [[Qing Dynasty]]. He established the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] over varying portions of southern China, with himself as the "[[Tian Wang|Heavenly King]]" and self-proclaimed brother of [[Jesus Christ]].

==Early life and education==
Hong Xiuquan (洪秀全), born "Hong Huoxiu", was the third and youngest son of a poor{{how|date=August 2018}} [[Hakka people|Hakka]] family.&lt;ref name="CW165"&gt;''China at War '' 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 12 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim his family was "well to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fall of Imperial China|first=Frederic Jr.|last=Wakeman|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in Fuyuan Springs, Hua county (now part of [[Huadu District]], [[Guangzhou]]), [[Guangdong]] to Hong Jingyang, a farmer and elected [[Dibao|headman]], and Madam Wang.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz H. Michael]], The Taiping Rebellion: History 21-22 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 11-12 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 27 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; He and his family moved to Guanlubu Village shortly after his birth.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 10 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Upon marrying his wife Lai Xiying, Hong received the courtesy name "Renkun."&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 10 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong showed an interest in scholarship at an early age, so his family made financial sacrifices to provide a formal education for him, in the hope that he could one day complete all of the [[Imperial examination|civil service examination]]s.&lt;ref name="CW165" /&gt; Hong began studying at a primary school in his village at the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 12 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was able to recite the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Four Books]] after five or six years.  He then took the local [[xiucai]] preliminary civil service examinations and placed first.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 13 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, he traveled to the nearby city of [[Guangzhou]] to take the imperial examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 13 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;   He was unsuccessful and, his parents being unable to afford to continue his education, he was forced to return to agricultural work.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 13 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;  The next year, he accompanied a wealthy schoolmate elsewhere for a year of study and became a village schoolteacher upon his return.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 13 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1836, at the age of 22, Hong returned to Guangzhou to retake the imperial examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 13 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; While in Guangzhou, Hong heard [[Edwin_Stevens_(missionary)|Edwin Stevens]], a foreign missionary, and his interpreter preaching about Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 14 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; From them, Hong received a set of pamphlets entitled "Good Words for Exhorting the Age", which were written by [[Liang Fa]], Stevens's assistant, and contained excerpts from the Bible along with homilies and other material prepared by Liang.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 14-15 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, Hong only briefly looked over these pamphlets and did not pay much attention to them at the time.&lt;ref name="CW165" /&gt; Unsurprisingly, he again failed the imperial examinations, which had a pass rate of less than one percent.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1990), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visions and iconoclasm==
In 1837, Hong attempted and failed the imperial examinations for a third time, leading to a [[nervous breakdown]].&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 15-18 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was delirious for days and his family feared for his life.&lt;ref&gt;Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 23 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; While [[convalescing]], Hong dreamt that he visited Heaven and discovered that he possessed a celestial family distinct from his earthly family, which included a heavenly father, mother, elder brother, sister-in-law, wife, and son.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 47-48 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; His heavenly father, wearing a black dragon robe and high-brimmed hat with a long golden beard, lamented that men were worshiping demons rather than him and presented Hong with a sword and golden seal with which to slay the demons infesting Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 48 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hong dreamt that he did so with the help of his celestial older-brother and a heavenly army.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 48 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The father figure later informed Hong that his given name violated taboos and must be changed, suggesting as one option the "Hong Xiuquan" moniker ultimately adopted by Hong.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 49 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  In later embellishments, Hong would declare that he also saw [[Confucius]] being punished by Hong's celestial father for leading the people astray.&lt;ref&gt;Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 28 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; His acquaintances would later claim that after awakening from his dreams Hong became more careful, friendly, and open, while his pace became imposing and firm and his height and size increased.&lt;ref&gt;Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 23 (1966) (quoting Theodore Hamberg, The Visions of Hung-Siu-tshuen and Origin of the Kwang-si Insurrection 14 (Hong Kong, 1854))&lt;/ref&gt; Hong stopped studying for the imperial examinations and sought work as a teacher. For the next several years Hong taught at several schools around the area of his hometown.

In 1843, Hong failed the imperial examinations for the fourth and final time.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 19 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; It was only then, prompted by a visit by his cousin, that Hong took time to carefully examine the Christian pamphlets he had received.&lt;ref&gt;Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 20 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; After reading these pamphlets, Hong came to believe that they had given him the key to interpreting his visions: his celestial father was [[God the Father]] (whom he identified with [[Shangdi]] from Chinese tradition), the elder brother that he had seen was [[Jesus Christ]], and he had been directed to rid the world of demon worship.&lt;ref name=sources&gt;{{Cite book| last=De Bary| first= Wm. Theodore; Lufrano, Richard| title=Sources of Chinese Tradition| volume=2| year=2000| publisher=Columbia University Press| isbn=978-0-231-11271-0| pages=213–215| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 64 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation led him to conclude that he was the literal son of God and younger brother to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 65 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to some of the later leaders of his movement, Hong appears to have genuinely believed in his ascent to Heaven and divine mission.&lt;ref&gt;Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 36 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; After coming to this conclusion Hong began destroying idols and enthusiastically preaching his interpretation of Christianity.&lt;ref name="CW165" /&gt;  As a symbolic gesture to purge China of Confucianism, he and the cousin asked for two giant swords, three ''[[Chi (unit)|chi]]'' (about 1 metre) long and nine ''[[Catty|jin]]'' (about 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg), called the "demon-slaying swords" (斬妖劍), to be forged.&lt;ref&gt;Spence (1996), p. 67. "The two men discuss Hong's dream, and feel that some of it, at least, can be understood literally. So together they ordered a local craftsman to forge two double-edged swords--each sword nine pounds in weight, and three feet in length--with three characters carved upon each blade, 'Sword for exterminating demons'."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong began by burning all [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Buddhist statue]]s and books in his house, and began preaching to his community about his visions. Some of his earliest converts were relatives of his who had also failed their examinations and belonged to the Hakka minority, [[Feng Yunshan]] and [[Hong Rengan]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 67 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated with them to destroy holy statues in small villages, to the ire of local citizens and officials. Hong and his converts' acts were considered [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]] and they were persecuted by Confucians who forced them to leave their positions as village tutors. In April 1844, Hong, Feng Yunshan, and two other relatives of Hong left Hua county to travel and preach.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 69 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; They first journeyed to Guangzhou and preached in the outlying areas before heading northwest to White Tiger Village.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 71 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  There, Hong and Feng Yunshan split off and traveled some 250 miles to the southwest to the village of Sigu, [[Guiping county]], [[Guangxi]], where distant relatives of Hong's resided, including two early converts who had returned home.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 71 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; It is in or near Sigu that Hong begins to draft "Exhortations to Worship the One True God," his first substantial work.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 72 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1844, after having preached in Guangxi for five months, Hong returned home without Feng and resumed his previous job as a village teacher, while continuing to write religious tracts.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 78-79 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The God Worshippers==
In 1847, Hong Xiuquan was invited by a member of the Chinese Union to study with the American [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] missionary, Reverend [[Issachar Jacox Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 93 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Hong accepted and traveled to Guangzhou with his cousin Hong Rengan.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 93 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Once there, Hong studied [[Karl Gützlaff|Karl Gützlaff's]] translations of the Old and New Testaments and requested to be baptized by Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 93 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts refused to do so, possibly due to Hong being tricked by the other converts into requesting monetary aid from Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 93 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hong left Guangzhou on July 12, 1847 to search for Feng Yunshan.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 93-94 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although robbed of all of his possessions, including his demon-slaying sword, by bandits in the town of [[Meizixun]],{{where|date=August 2018}} he eventually reached [[Thistle Mountain]] on August 27, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 94-95 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  There, he reunited with Feng and discovered the Society of God-Worshippers Feng had founded.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 95 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1848, Feng Yunshan was arrested and banished to [[Guangdong]], and Hong Xiuquan left for Guangdong shortly thereafter to once again reunite with Feng.&lt;ref&gt;Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 34-37 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;  In Feng and Hong's absence, [[Yang Xiuqing]] and [[Xiao Chaogui]] emerged to lead the God Worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 35 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both claimed to enter trances which allowed them to speak as a member of the [[Trinity]]; God the Father in the case of Yang and Jesus Christ in the case of Xiao.&lt;ref&gt;Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 35 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;  When Hong and Feng returned in the summer of 1849, they investigated Yang and Xiao's claims and declared them to be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 37 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hong administered to the faithful in outdoor meetings strongly resembling the Baptist tent revivals he had witnessed with Issachar Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Kyle Crossley, The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800 104 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Hong Xiuquan's knowledge of the scriptures came from the books known as "Good Words to Admonish the Age" by the Chinese preacher [[Liang Fa]] and a localized Bible translated into Chinese. Many Western missionaries grew jealous of Hong and his local ministry. These missionaries were fond of spreading rumors about him, one such rumor being that he had not been baptized (Hong and his cousin were in fact both baptized according to the way prescribed in the pamphlet "Good words to admonish the age").&lt;ref&gt;The Taiping rebellion History and Documents Volume 1 p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847, Hong began his translation and adaptation of the Bible, what came to be known as "Authorized Taiping Version of the Bible, or "[[Bible translations into Chinese#The Taiping Bible|The Taiping Bible]]", which he based on Gutzlaff's translation. He presented his followers with the Bible as a vision of the authentic religion that had existed in ancient China before it was wiped out by Confucius and the imperial system. The deity of the Old Testament punished evil nations and rewarded those who followed his commandments, even music, food, and marriage laws.&lt;ref name="Reilly "/&gt; 

Hong made some minor changes in the text, such as correcting misprints and improving the prose style, but adapted the meaning elsewhere to fit his own theology and moral teachings. For instance, in Genesis 27:25 the Israelites did not drink wine, and in Genesis 38:16-26 he omitted the sexual relations between the father and his son's widow.&lt;ref name="Reilly " &gt;Thomas H. Reilly. ''The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom: Rebellion and the Blasphemy of Empire.''(Seattle: University of Washington Press,  2004).   {{ISBN|0295984309}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=wm4CuSvIYiEC&amp;dq=Chinese+Vernacular+Bible+Translations&amp;q=Taiping+Bible#v=snippet&amp;q=Taiping%20Bible&amp;f=false  pp. 74-79]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hong preached a mixture of communal utopianism, [[evangelism]], and Christianity. While proclaiming sexual equality, the sect segregated men from women and encouraged all its followers to pay their assets into a communal treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Michael The Taiping Rebellion History and Documents pg. 47, pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hong returned to Guangxi, he found that [[Feng Yunshan]] had accumulated a following of around 2,000 converts. Guangxi was a dangerous area at this time with many bandit groups based in the mountains and pirates on the rivers. Perhaps due to these more pressing concerns, the authorities were largely tolerant of Hong and his followers. However, the instability of the region meant that Hong's followers were inevitably drawn into conflict with other groups, not least because of their predominately Hakka ethnicity. There are records of numerous incidents when local villages and clans, as well as groups of pirates and bandits, came into conflict with the authorities, and responded by fleeing to join Hong's movement. The rising tension between the sect and the authorities was probably the most important factor in Hong's eventual decision to rebel.

==Rebellion and the Heavenly Kingdom==
{{Main article|Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Heavenly Kingdom}}
By 1850 Hong had between 10,000 and 30,000 followers. The authorities were alarmed at the growing size of the sect and ordered them to disperse. A local force was sent to attack them when they refused, but the imperial troops were routed and a deputy magistrate killed. A full-scale attack was launched by government forces in the first month of 1851, in what came to be known as the [[Jintian Uprising]], named after the town of Jintian (present-day [[Guiping]], [[Guangxi]]) where the sect was based. Hong's followers emerged victorious and beheaded the [[Manchu]] commander of the government army. Hong declared the founding of the "Heavenly Kingdom of Transcendent Peace" on 11 January 1851.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hongxiuquan.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Hong Xiuquan|302x302px]] --&gt;
Despite this evidence of planning, Hong and his followers faced immediate challenges. The local [[Green Standard Army]] outnumbered them ten to one, and had recruited the help of the river pirates to keep the rebellion contained to Jintian. After a month of preparation the rebels managed to break through the blockade and fight their way to the town of Yongan (not to be confused with [[Yong'an]]), which fell to them on 25 September 1851.

Hong and his troops remained in Yongan for three months, sustained by local landowners who were hostile to the Manchu-ruled Qing Dynasty. The imperial army regrouped and launched another attack on the rebels in Yongan. Having run out of gunpowder, Hong's followers fought their way out by sword, and made for the city of [[Guilin]], to which they laid siege. However, the fortifications of Guilin proved too strong, and Hong and his followers eventually gave up and set out northwards, towards [[Hunan]]. Here, they encountered an elite militia created by a local member of the gentry specifically to put down peasant rebellions. The two forces fought at Soyi Ford on 10 June 1852 where the rebels were forced into retreat, and 20% of their troops were killed. However, in March 1853, Hong's forces managed to take [[Nanjing]] and turned it into the capital of their movement.

After establishing his capital at [[Nanjing]] Hong implemented an ambitious programme of reforms. He created an elaborate civil bureaucracy, reformed the calendar used in his kingdom, outlawed opium use, and introduced a number of reforms designed to make women more socially equal to men.&lt;ref name="CW165" /&gt; Hong ruled by making frequent proclamations from his Heavenly Palace, demanding strict compliance with various moral and religious rules. Most trade was suppressed, and some communal land ownership was introduced. [[Polygamy]] was forbidden and men and women were separated, although Hong and other leaders maintained groups of concubines.

[[Yang Xiuqing]], also known as the "East King", was a fellow Taiping leader who had directed successful military campaigns and who often claimed to speak with the voice of God. Hong became increasingly suspicious of Yang's ambitions and his network of spies. In 1856, he and others in the Taiping élite had Yang and his family murdered in a purge that spiralled out of control, resulting in the further purge of its main perpetrator Wei Changhui.&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Kuhn, "The Taiping Rebellion." Late Ch'ing 1800–1911, Part I. Ed. John K. Fairbank.
(Cambridge University Press, 1978). Cambridge Histories Online. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a failed attempt by the Taiping rebels to take Shanghai in 1860, Qing government forces, aided by Western officers, slowly gained ground.

==Death==
In the spring of 1864, Nanjing was besieged and dangerously low on food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 324 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hong's solution was to order his subjects to eat [[manna]], which had been translated into Chinese as sweetened dew and a medicinal herb.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 324-25 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hong himself gathered weeds from the grounds of his palace, which he then ate.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 325 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hong fell ill in April 1864, possibly due to his ingestion of the weeds, and died on June 1, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 325 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Hong likely died of his illness, suicide by poison has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 325 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 173 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was buried in a yellow-silk shroud without a coffin in the bare ground, per Taiping custom.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D.

Spence, God's Chinese Son 325 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 1864, Qing forces exhumed, beheaded, and burned his body.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 371 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; His body was later exhumed on orders of Zeng Guofan to verify his death, and then cremated. Hong's ashes were later blasted out of a cannon in order to ensure that his remains have no resting place as eternal punishment for the uprising. The Taiping Rebellion was suppressed by Qing forces later in 1864.

==Legacy==
Views and opinions on Hong differ greatly. The [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] under [[Mao Zedong]] generally admired Hong and his movement as a legitimate peasant uprising that anticipated their own.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;Cohen, Paul A. (2003). China Unbound: Evolving Perspectives on the Chinese Past, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun Yat-sen]] came from the same area as Hong and was said to have identified with Hong since his childhood days.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

In 1959, the People's Republic of China established a small museum, Hong Xiuquan's Former Residence Memorial Museum (洪秀全故居紀念館), in his birthplace, where there is a [[longan]] tree planted by him. The museum's plate is written by the famous literary figure [[Guo Moruo]] (1892&amp;ndash;1978). The residence and Book Chamber Building were renovated in 1961.

There has been an active academic debate on the degree to which Hong is similar or dissimilar to [[Falun Gong]] founder [[Li Hongzhi]]. Scholars that promote the opinion that a strong similarity exists between Li and Hong note that both rallied a large number of people behind a religious or spiritual cause in order to challenge the ''status quo''. Scholars disputing a close relationship note that Li's political intentions are debatable.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Noah.

'''Inn Babawayh cemetery''', '''Ebn-e Babveyh''', or '''Ibn-e Baabevey''' &lt;ref name="irib"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.irib.ir/Ouriran/mashahir/mazhabi/ebnbaboyeh/html/en/page.htm |title=Ibn Babviyeh |work= |publisher= Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting Website |accessdate=2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fa|'''ابن بابويه'''}}) is located in [[Iran]] in the town of [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] (now inside [[Greater Tehran]]  metropolitan area).

The cemetery is named after the most famous occupant, [[Ibn Babawayh]] (d.991 CE) a famous scholar of [[Shia]] Islam. He taught in [[Baghdad]] and lived in [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] at the end of his life. His works (more than 300 volumes) are used as valid sources in [[Jurisprudence]]. His most famous book is ''Man La-yahzar al-faqih''. He died in 381 A.H. and his tomb is in Ebn-e Babooyeh.&lt;ref name="irib"/&gt;

Many Iranian giants of sports, literature, arts, culture, religion, and politics are buried there. The reason for this is Rey being a Shiite pilgrimage site because of the [[Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine]], which led many pious people to be buried near to this place.

I'''ndochristian art''', or '''''arte indocristiano''''', is a type of Latin American art that combines European colonial influences with Indigenous artistic styles and traditions.

During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, [[Franciscans|Franciscan]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], and [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monks extensively converted indigenous peoples to Christianity, introducing them to European arts and aesthetics. The arts of this period reflect a fusion of European and indigenous religious beliefs, aesthetics, and artistic traditions.

The term Indochristian art was coined by [[Constantino Reyes-Valerio]], a scholar of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture and arts, in his book, ''Indochristian Art, Sculpture and Painting of 16th Century Mexico''. Reyes-Valerio's work focused on the painting and sculpture of churches and monasteries in [[New Spain]], but had broader implications for the analysis of art throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azulmaya.com/indocristiano/index.php|title=Arte Indocristiano: Pintura y Escultura en la Nueva España|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|date=2000|website=www.azulmaya.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the term ==

=== Coinage of term ''Indochristian Art'' ===
The term ''indochristian art'' was coined by Constantino Reyes-Valerio in his 1978 work, ''Arte indocristiano: escultura del siglo XVI en México''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arte indocristiano: escultura del siglo XVI en México|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|publisher=Escuela Nacional de Conservación, Restauración y Museografía "Prof. Manuel del Castillo Negrete", SEP, Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' This work was followed by an analysis of indochristian mural painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El pintor de conventos: los murales del siglo XVI en la Nueva España|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two books were re-published in combined form in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arte indocristiano|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Reyes-Valerio defines indochristian art as art that is indigenous in its production but Christian in its themes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; using the term as a designation for artwork that blended symbolic elements of Christian and pre-Hispanic cultures. An expert in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican sculpture, Reyes-Valerio focuses his studies on art produced in monastic settings in New Spain, primarily examining sculptures and paintings that ornament monasteries and convents, and identifying iconographic connections to earlier indigenous works.

Reyes-Valerio's coinage of the term indochristian art was based on his 45 years of experience studying pre-Columbian and colonial monuments throughout Mexico.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosquillas Quiles|first=Hortensia|date=Spring 2008|title=Constantino Reyes-Valerio, Arte indocristiano, México, INAH (Obra diversa), 2000, 486 pp., epílogo, apéndice y bibliografía|url=|journal=BOLETÍN DE MONUMENTOS HISTÓRICOS|volume=12|pages=159–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tracing the indigenous influence on colonial art, Reyes-Valerio relies primarily on close analysis of artistic details and motifs, a process he calls “speaking to the art”, but supports this analysis with documentary sources such as the journals of Augustinian, Franciscan, and Dominican friars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reyes-Valerio not only discusses indigenous artistic production, but ties this art to the educational systems created by European monks. He argues that the use of traditional native religious imagery by Indian artists is a form of rebellion intended to keep their traditions alive. 

=== Criticisms of the term ===
Although the significance of Reyes-Valerio's contribution to the identification of indigenous iconography within colonial monastic art is widely recognized, a number of art historians have criticized the implications of the word "indochristian" as well as Reyes-Valerio's analysis of the cultural context in which the art was produced.

In the book, ''Mestizaje and Globalization : Transformations of Identity and Power,'' Stefanie Wickstrom argues against the use of the term "indochristian". Wickstrom claims that the term oversimplifies colonial monastic art and the intentions of the artists by categorizing each element as either Indian or Christian in symbolism, failing to account for the evolution of a mestizo art form as Christian symbolism made contact with new cultures and evolved.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mestizaje and Globalization : Transformations of Identity and Power|last=Wickstrom|first=Stefanie|last2=Young|first2=Philip D.|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Tucson|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have objected to Reyes-Valerio's discussion of colonization; in discussing the colonization of New Spain, Reyes-Valerio makes the controversial claim that the spiritual conquest of Europeans over indigenous people was more damaging than the armed conquest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further, in his descriptions of the interactions between monks and indigenous people, Reyes-Valerio focuses primarily on the psychological harm done to the indigenous people as they lost their ancestral religious beliefs, and tends to overlook the physical harm inflicted upon them by Christian leaders. 

=== Related discussion of Indigenous artistic influence ===
Throughout the twentieth century, there were a number of movements to re-evaluate the role of indigenous peoples in creation of Latin American national identities. In Mexico following the revolution, the [[Indigenismo in Mexico|Indigenismo]] movement placed increased value on indigenous culture and historical significance. This shift was reflected in a shift in art historian’s attitudes towards indigenous art and aesthetics. These influences on colonial art had largely been overlooked up until this point.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Recognition of indigenous artistic influences varied widely, with art historians only gradually recognizing the existence of an indigenous influence on Mexican colonial art. In 1939, Agustin Velazquez Chavez described the art of New Spain as the product of a mixing of Indian and Spanish cultures in conflict, placing special significance on the “Mexican” nature of this entwining of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tres siglos de pintura colonial mexicana|last=Velázquez Chávez|first=Agustín|publisher=Editiorial Polis|year=1939|isbn=|location=Mexico|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the Churrigueresque art of Mexico, Miguel Toussaint used the term “mestizo,” recognizing the participation of Indigenous people in the art of colonial Mexico.

The term “Tequitqui” was created by Jose Moreno Villa to categorize artistic works with a fusion of Spanish and Indigenous elements. With this term, which in Nahuatl means “tributary,” Moreno Villa drew a comparison between the art of colonial Mexico and the [[Mudéjar]] art of Muslims in Spain during the Reconquista.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La escultura colonial mexicana|last=Moreno Villa|first=Jose|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1942|isbn=|location=Mexico City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tequitqui was the first term used specifically to identify art combining colonial and indigenous influences, however, Moreno Villa limited its application to works in which the indigenous artist represents atavistic religious symbols. In later works Moreno Villa elaborates on his interpretation of Mexican colonial art, stating that the indigenous contribution to the genre was limited to the non-Christian deities represented, while claiming that the artistic style of colonial artworks was not tied to indigenous artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lo Mexicano en las artes plasticas|last=Moreno Villa|first=Jose|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1948|isbn=|location=Mexico City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of Indochristian Art ==
[[File:Malinalco Hallway.jpg|thumb|Murals at the mission church of San Salvador, Malinalco, Mexico use native flora and fauna and indigenous concepts of the afterlife to depict the Christian garden of paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frames for conversion: The assimilation of native motifs in the monastic decoration of New Spain (1540–1580)|last=Dominguez Torres|first=Monica|publisher=University of Toronto|year=2004|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although the term "indochristian art" was originally only used to describe Mexican monastic sculpture and murals, by definition, it applies to any art that is created by indigenous artists and contains Christian themes. It can be applied to a wide variety of artistic traditions from colonial Latin America. The term becomes increasingly difficult to apply to art in the late colonial and post-colonial periods, however, as it relies upon a clearly defined opposition between indigenous artist and Euro-Christian themes. The way that indochristian art is defined overlooks the entanglement of Native and European identities and the mixing of cultures that gradually developed throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Religious artworks from colonial Latin America often demonstrate indochristian influence in a variety of ways. Indochristian art often includes depictions of atavistic deities and religious symbols, hieroglyphs, figures with indigenous features and traditional indigenous dress, and native flora and fauna. In addition, it may use traditional artistic styles of representation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Monastic Art ===
In the early years of colonization, art was primarily commissioned by the church. As Augustinian, Dominican, and Franciscan missionaries attempted to convert the native populations of the Americas, their techniques varied widely, but frequently involved threats of violence. Missionaries generally attempted to eliminate indigenous culture, converting native people not only to Christianity, but also to European social practices.

Much Latin American monastic art of the colonial period could be designated as indochristian. Murals, paintings, architectural designs, sculptures, and ornamental objects all were frequently created by native craftspeople and incorporated indigenous iconography.

=== Cuzco School ===
The [[Cuzco School]] was an artistic tradition associated with Cusco, Peru. Following the Spanish conquest of the Incan empire, a group of Spanish religious artists were sent to Cusco to aid in the conversion of Inca people to Catholicism. This group of artists began a school, teaching Quechua and mestizo people to draw and use oil paints according to European styles.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of Colonial Latin America|last=Bailey|first=Gauvin Alexander|publisher=Phaidon|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Sor María Juana de Señor San Rafael y Martínez.jpg|thumb|An example of a crowned nun, combining traditional Mesoamerican flower art with Christian iconography]]Based on pre-columbian artistic traditions, Cusqueño painters created artworks anonymously and included native flora and fauna in their works. They also created a tradition of painting Inca monarchs – a departure from Christian religious themes and an expression of cultural pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America|last=Bethell|first=Leslie|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ángel Arcabucero (Arquebusier Angel) ===
[[Ángel arcabucero]] is a genre of painting tied to the Cuzco school. These paintings depict angels holding an arquebus, or early firearm, and dressed in clothing reminiscent of that worn by Andean nobility. These angels are believed to be connected to pre-Hispanic winged warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ángeles apócrifos en la América virreinal|last=Mujica Pinilla|first=Ramon|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1992|isbn=|location=Lima|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monja Coronada (Crowned Nun) ===
Monja Coronada (Crowned nun) is a genre of portrait paintings common among Mexican convents. These commemorative portraits of nuns wearing bridal clothes and floral crowns were common in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.virreinato.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=88|title=Monjas Coronadas. Vida conventual femenina|last=|first=|date=|website=Museo Nacional de Virreinato|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a Euro-Christian perspective, the nuns' bridal trappings allude to the Virgin Mary crowned, symbolizing mystical marriage to God and victory over sin. This Christian symbolism is, however, combined with Mesoamerican imagery; the paintings frequently replace the traditional European palm frond with a Mesoamerican flower staff, and ornament the crown with flowers according to traditional flower art practices. In addition, the bird and butterfly imagery that is frequently included in crowned nun portraits may symbolize indigenous beliefs regarding the soul and the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cordova|first=James M.|date=2011-12-01|title=Clad in Flowers: Indigenous Arts and Knowledge in Colonial Mexican Convents|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00043079.2011.10786018|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=93|issue=4|pages=449–467|doi=10.1080/00043079.2011.10786018|issn=0004-3079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JewTube''' is a free [[video sharing]] website comprising Jewish-oriented [[user-generated content]]. It offers a selection of curated Jewish-themed videos.  JewTube was founded by Matthew Kwok, a Los Angeles-based [[entrepreneur]].

Visitors to the site view videos on a wide array of Jewish-themed content, with subjects as varied as [[Jewish cooking]] and "alternative animated endings" to the [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] film, ''[[Borat (film)|Borat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Seeking a skullcap for your dog? Try www.JewTube.com" (http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/879405.html).  Ha'aretz (Haaretz.com). 8 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, Google challenged a New York City based company, NetParty, for the use of the name "JewTube", on trademark grounds, as they felt the name was too similar to the [[YouTube]] video sharing website.  NetParty is not related or affiliated with the JewTube website.&lt;ref&gt;"Google: JewTube Is Not Kosher" (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/14/google-jewtube-is-not-ko_n_64490.html).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">[[File:Radost ordynka.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Icon of the Mother of God “Joy of all who Sorrow”]]

In [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] [[Christianity]], the '''Joy of All Who Sorrow''' ({{lang-ru|Всех скорбящих Радость}}) is a title given to the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mary, the mother of Jesus]]). The iconography is specifically Russian, without Byzantine precedent.

It is also a type of [[icon]] that depicts the [[Theotokos]] in a specific manner, standing beneath her Son, who is in Heaven as a king, and surrounded by people and [[angels]]. In addition, specific hymns are dedicated to celebrating her role of bringing hope and salvation into the world, thus becoming joy for all who sorrow:

:"To Thee, the champion leader, do we Thy servants dedicate a hymn of victory and thanksgiving, as ones who have been delivered from eternal death by the Grace of Christ our God Who was born of Thee and by Thy maternal mediation before Him. As Thou dost have invincible might, free us from all misfortunes and sorrowful circumstances who cry aloud:

:Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos, full of Grace, Joy of all who sorrow!". 

Many Orthodox parishes are named "Joy of all who Sorrow" and specific commemoration of the Joy of all who Sorrow is on July 23, on Orthodox calendars.

==Background==

The [[Catholic Church]] is not measured similarly as it doesn't meet the characteristics of a megachurch.&lt;ref name="Hartford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/megachurch/definition.html |title=The Definition of a Megachurch |publisher=Hartford Institute for Religion Research |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2013-07-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514173618/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/megachurch/definition.html |archivedate=2016-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 3,000 Catholic churches have 2,000+ attending each week,&lt;ref name="Hartford"/&gt; which is more than the 2,000 members for listing here. St Ann's in [[Coppell, Texas]], would be near the top, with almost 30,000 registered parishioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stannparish.org/ |title=Welcome to St. Ann Catholic Parish |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership numbers of the following churches give only a very rough indication of size. They vary from year to year. Also, some churches report typical Sunday attendance while others report the number who are listed in church records or make financial contributions, which may be higher. Some of the larger churches are [[multi-site church]]es. Many churches deliver their message through [[television]] or other media, sometimes reaching much higher numbers than those who physically attend the church.

'''Lorraine Pascale''' (born 17 November 1972) is an English television cook and former model, best known for selling almost one million books in the UK alone. She has presented three television series for the [[BBC]] and has opened her own retail outlet in London selling baked goods.

==Personal life==
Pascale was born to [[Afro-Caribbean|African-Caribbean]] parents&lt;ref name=gua/&gt; in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] at The Mothers' Hospital and was fostered shortly after she was born.&lt;ref&gt;''Fostering and Me with Lorraine Pascale.'' BBC documentary. (Shown on BBC2 on 19 June 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[adoption|adopted]] at 18 months old and brought up in [[Oxfordshire]] by an ethnically English family. When her adoptive parents divorced when she was three years old, Pascale remained with her mother, who subsequently became ill. At this point, at age seven, she was [[Foster care|fostered]] to more than one family, with differing degrees of 'fit'. Eventually she returned to her mother. She won a full scholarship given by the [[Buttle UK|Buttle Trust]] and so was educated at a [[boarding school]] in Devon.&lt;ref name=gua&gt;{{cite web | last=McGrath | first=Nick | title=Lorraine Pascale: My family values | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=22 January 2011 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/22/lorraine-pascal-baking-cakes | accessdate=22 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascale has an elder adoptive brother and a half-sister (her adoptive father had a daughter after the divorce). She knows her biological parents' identity and their four other children, but she does not wish to re-establish contact.&lt;ref name=gua /&gt;

Pascale was married to Polish musician Count Kazimierz Balinski-Jundzill and the couple had a daughter, actress [[Ella Balinska]]. The couple separated in 2000 and subsequently divorced.&lt;ref name=gua /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dunbar | first=Polly | title=From the catwalk to TV's Queen of Cakes: Lorraine Pascale tells her inspiring story | work=Daily Mail | date=14 February 2011 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1356398/From-catwalk-TVs-Queen-Cakes-Lorraine-Pascale-tells-inspiring-story.html | accessdate=8 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At age 16, Pascale was spotted as potential model by the agent who had found [[Naomi Campbell]].&lt;ref name=fmd&gt;{{cite web | last= | first= | title=Lorraine Pascale | work=[[Fashion Model Directory]] | date=2 January 2011 | url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/Lorraine_Pascale/| accessdate=22 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in New York, she achieved recognition as the first black British model to appear on the cover of American ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]''.&lt;ref name=obs&gt;{{cite web | last=Cooke | first=Rachel | title=Lorraine Pascale: 'I absolutely eat what I cook' | work=[[The Observer]] | date=2 January 2011 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jan/02/lorraine-pascale-ellas-bakery-cupcakes | accessdate=22 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in the 1998 [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue|''Sports Illustrated'' swimsuit issue]],&lt;ref name="sportsillustrated"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/swimsuit/modelfeatured/lorraine_pascale/1998/model/1/5/index.htm |title=Swimsuit collection – Lorraine Pascale |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured as one of the '[[Bond Girls]]' in [[Robbie Williams]] "[[Millennium (song)|Millennium]]" video.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/baking-hot-with-new-bbc-chef-lorraine-pascale-6566152.html Baking hot with new BBC chef, Lorraine Pascale]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascale recognised the need to ensure her future after modelling and embarked on a series of career "try-outs", including [[hypnotherapy]] and [[car mechanic]]s. She took a diploma cookery course at Leith's School of Food and Wine in 2005 and found that cookery fitted her "like a pair of old jeans". After gaining her diploma, she did a series of 'stages' in some London restaurants but, realising that restaurant hours would not suit her, Pascale established herself as a specialist cakemaker, with a contract with [[Selfridges]]. Her introduction to Selfridges was at the suggestion of chef [[Marco Pierre White]] and in 2008 and 2010 she supplied the London store with over 1000 Christmas cakes. Pascale has opened her own cupcake shop in [[Covent Garden]]. She also studied Culinary Arts at Thames Valley University (now [[University of West London]]) and in March 2012 graduated with a first class degree.&lt;ref name=obs /&gt;&lt;ref name=obsa&gt;{{cite web | last=Vernon | first=Polly | title=The model baker | work=[[The Observer]] | date=24 May 2009 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/may/24/lorraine-pascale-model-baker | accessdate=22 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Pascale said she practises [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] to relax after work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fitspiration – Lorraine Pascale|url=http://hipandhealthy.com/fitspiration-lorraine-pascale/|website=Hip &amp; Healthy|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=5 March 2015|quote=To unwind after a busy day I practise transcendental meditation which I do morning and evening for 20 minutes each time. ... The meditation keeps me grounded, learn to be honest with myself, and only do the things which I feel will make me happy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and publishing work===
In January 2011,  Pascale presented a television bakery programme in 2011, ''Baking Made Easy'', on [[BBC]] television&lt;ref name=obs /&gt; and published a bakery book based upon this series. Later that year, a second series, ''Home Cooking Made Easy'', was broadcast in September and October, with an accompanying book. A ''Last Minute Christmas'' programme aired on BBC Two on 22 December 2011. A third book was published in 2012 and a series based upon it, called ''Fast, Fresh &amp; Easy Food'', aired in August and September 2012 on [[BBC Two]].

Since January 2014, Pascale co-presents and judges the UK version of ''[[My Kitchen Rules (UK TV series)|My Kitchen Rules]]'' with [[Jason Atherton]] on [[Sky Living]]. In early 2014, it was announced that Pascale was to host a new six-part television series called ''Lorraine Pascale: How to be a Better Cook'' that would air later in the year on [[BBC Two]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atvtoday.co.uk/54372-bbc/ |title=Lorraine Pascale gives novice cooks a helping hand in BBC Two factual series |publisher=ATV Today |date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, she co-hosted ''The Nation's Favourite Food'' alongside [[the Hairy Bikers]]. The show aired for one episode on BBC Two.

Lorraine is also a judge on [[Food Network]]'s ''[[Holiday Baking Championship]]'' and ''[[Spring Baking Championship]]'' as well as a mentor on ''[[Worst Bakers in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/hosts/lorraine-pascale/bio.html?oc=linkback|title=Lorraine Pascale Bio : Food Network|website=www.foodnetwork.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a judge in a few episodes of the first season of ''Bakers Vs Fakers'', and became the hostess for Season 2.

'''Netu Yukam''', according to [[Ayyavazhi mythology]], was a time when another fragment of [[Kroni]] was created into two wicked persons called [[Thillaimallalan]] and [[Mallosivahanan]]. They ruled over the people most wickedly by extracting [[Uliyam]] and [[Iraikal]] ([[taxes]]) from them. When it became unbearable, the [[Thevarkal]] (celestial beings) complained to [[Shiva|Isvaran]], who in turn commissioned [[Thirumal|Mayon]] to carry out the destruction of the wicked rulers, which he later did.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3263">{{missing information|examples|date=May 2008}}In [[Roman Catholic]] teaching, '''occasions of sin''' are "external circumstances--whether of things or persons--which either because of their special nature or because of the frailty common to humanity or peculiar to some individual, incite or entice one to sin."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11196a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;



There are both proximate and remote occasions, where a proximate occasion is one in which men of like calibre for the most part fall into [[mortal sin]], or one in which experience points to the same result from the special weakness of a particular person. The remote occasion lacks these elements. All theologians are agreed that there is no obligation to avoid the remote occasions of sin both because this would, practically speaking, be impossible and because they do not involve serious danger of sin.

The proximate occasion may be '''necessary''', that is, such as a person cannot abandon or get rid of. Whether this impossibility be physical or moral does not matter for the determination of the principles hereinafter to be laid down.  A proximate occasion may be deemed necessary when it cannot be given up without grave [[Scandal (theology)|scandal]] or loss of good name or without notable temporal or spiritual damage. 

It may be '''voluntary''', within the competency of one to remove. Moralists distinguish between a proximate occasion which is continuous and one which, whilst it is unquestionably proximate, yet confronts a person only at intervals. Someone who is in the presence of a proximate occasion at once voluntary and continuous is bound to remove it. 

In [[Confession (religion)|confession]], a refusal on the part of a penitent to do so would make it imperative for the confessor to deny absolution. It is not always necessary for the confessor to await the actual performance of this duty before giving absolution; he may be content with a sincere promise, which is the minimum to be required.

In [[root cause analysis]] the occasion of sin is identical to the idea of "set-up factors", i,e, situations in which it is likely for a person to perform dysfunctionally. In the nuclear industry community there is a set of ideas called "Event Free tools" that includes the idea of avoiding "Error Likely Situations", which are also called "Human Error Precursors."  

In social counseling there is the acronymic advice, HALT (Hungry? Angry? Lonely? Tired?) relating to situations in which judgment is impaired.  These may be regarded as "occasions of sin."

The rulers of Singhasari and Majapahit trace their origins back to the mysterious figure of [[Ken Arok]] or Sri Ranggah Rajasa, who founded the Rajasa dynasty early in the 13th century. According to the [[Pararaton]], Ken Arok was born in the Tumapel region (present day [[Malang]], [[East Java]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastjava.com/books/majapahit/html/dynasty.html |title=Rajasa Dynasty|publisher=East Java.com|date=|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered as the dynasty founder of both the Singhasari and Majapahit line of monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA1208&amp;lpg=PA1208&amp;dq=Rajasa+Dynasty+is+the+Singhasari+Majapahit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3VwRFf5dXV&amp;sig=8DfkNK8l9qK94JNkfNLuDsWrcoc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7lxMTIXRBYXCrAeQzaG5Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rajasa%20Dynasty%20is%20the%20Singhasari%20Majapahit&amp;f=false |title=Southeast Asia: a historical encyclopedia|publisher=Books Google|date=|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common syncretic religion is [[Santería]], which combined the [[Yoruba religion]] of the [[Slavery in Cuba|African slaves]] with Catholicism and some Native American strands; it shows similarities to [[Brazil]]ian [[Umbanda]] and has been receiving a degree of official support.
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] estimates that 60 percent of the population is Catholic,&lt;ref name="StateDep"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127386.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2009: Cuba | date= October 2009| accessdate=2010-07-16 | publisher=US State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only 5% of that 60% attends mass regularly,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wola.org/es/comentario/comunidades_de_fe_en_cuba_primera_parte_de_la_serie_de_fondo_de_wola_sobre_la_religion_en "Comunidades de Fe en Cuba: Primera parte de la serie de fondo de WOLA sobre la religión en Cuba" Washington Office on Latin America, March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; while independent sources estimate that as few 1.5% of the population does so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laarena.com.ar/opinion-cada_uno_en_lo_suyo__con_coincidencias_y_discrepancias-72748-111.html "Cada uno en lo suyo, con coincidencias y discrepancias", La Arena (Argentina), March 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in [[Protestant]] churches is estimated to be 5 percent and includes [[Baptists]], [[Pentecostals]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Presbyterians]], [[Anglicans]], [[Methodists]], [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), and [[Lutherans]]. In recent decades Cuba has seen a rapid growth of Evangelical Protestants: "Cuba’s Christians have thrived despite the island’s politics and poverty. Their improbable, decades-long revival is often described as being rivaled only by China’s. “It’s incredible. People just come on their own, looking for God,” says a Western Baptist leader." &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2015/november/will-success-spoil-cuba-revival-havana-us-embargo.html?share=sWB%2ftrGdBkDqJGldddmS3gYj1MfMoyag|title=Will success spoil Cuba's Revival?|work=Christianity Today October 26,2015|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian denominations include the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons).   

Non-Christian minority religions in Cuba include [[Hinduism in the West Indies|Hinduism]] and [[Chinese folk religion]], which each account for 0.2% of the population, as well as the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jews in Cuba|Judaism]], [[Islam in Cuba|Islam]], and [[New religious movement|Neoreligions]], which all have non-negligible numbers of followers accounting for less than 0.1% of Cuba's population. In addition to the above, 18.0% of Cubans declared themselves to be [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] and 5.1% claimed to be [[Atheism|atheists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_63_2.asp|title=The Association of Religion Data Archives {{!}} National Profiles|website=www.thearda.com|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba is home to a variety of syncretic religions of largely African cultural origin. According to a US State Department report,&lt;ref name="StateDep"/&gt; some sources estimate that as much as 80 percent of the population consults with practitioners of religions with West African roots, such as Santeria or Yoruba. Santería developed out of the traditions of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], one of the African peoples who were imported to Cuba during the 16th through 19th centuries to work on the sugar plantations. Santería blends elements of [[Christianity]] and [[West African]] beliefs and as such made it possible for the slaves to retain their traditional beliefs while appearing to practice Catholicism. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (Our Lady Of Charity) is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and is greatly revered by the Cuban people and seen as a symbol of Cuba. In Santería, she has been syncretized with the goddess [[Ochún]]. The important religious festival "La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre" is celebrated by Cubans annually on 8 September. Other religions practised are [[Palo Monte]], and [[Abakuá]], which have large parts of their liturgy in African languages.

Although restrictions on religion in Cuba were minimal compared to other [[communist nation]]s like the [[Soviet Union]] or [[China]], the large atheist population was most likely caused by the communist atmosphere of [[Marxist-Leninist atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/cuba/religion.htm|title=Religion in Cuba|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the [[Cuban Revolution|communist revolution]] of 1959, the government of Cuba restricted religious practice.  Religious people were not allowed to join the Cuban Communist Party due to religion being contradictory to the party's Marxist philosophy. In August 1960, several bishops signed a joint pastoral letter condemning communism and declaring it incompatible with Catholicism, and calling on Catholics to reject it.&lt;ref name="Mallin1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay Mallin|title=Covering Castro: Rise and Decline of Cuba's Communist Dictator|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUGwuKQWXW8C|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2053-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro gave a four-hour speech the next day, condemning priests who serve "great wealth" and using fears of [[Falangism in Latin America|Falangist]] influence to attack Spanish born priests, declaring "There is no doubt that [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] has a sizeable group of fascist priests in Cuba."

However, the stance of the Cuban Communist Party has shifted. Raúl Castro said in a 2015 televised news conference in which he discussed [[Pope Francis]]'s September 2015 visit, "I am from the Cuban Communist Party that doesn't allow believers, but now we are allowing it. It's an important step."&lt;ref&gt;Jim Yardley, "Praising Pope, Cuban President says he might return to Church." ''New York Times'' May 11, 2015 A4.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro indicated he might return to being a practicing Catholic and that he would attend the Masses that the pope celebrates in Cuba.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2015"&gt;''New York Times'', May 11, 2015, A4&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies appeared that attempted to link Afro-Cuban religions with mental illness.&lt;ref name="Hernandez-Ramdwar, Camille 2006"&gt;
Hernandez-Ramdwar, Camille. "Christine Ayorinde: Afro-Cuban Religiosity, Revolution, and National Identity." Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies 31.62 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign for the eradication of racial discrimination in Cuba was (and still is) used as grounds to forbid the creation of Afro-Cuban institutions, because doing so was labelled as racially divisive.&lt;ref name="Hernandez-Ramdwar, Camille 2006"/&gt;

Pastor Clara Rodes Gonzalez claims "we suffered discrimination in the schools and at work."&lt;ref name="Oliva, Enrique Lopez 1994"&gt;Oliva, Enrique Lopez. "Religious reawakening: stirrings in Cuba." "&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-15861163/religious-reawakening-stirrings-in-cuba |title=Religious reawakening: stirrings in Cuba.| publisher=The Christian Century 111.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decade following the 1960s was turbulent, and many people lost interest in religion because much of the religious hierarchy opposed the popular revolution.  The [[Archdiocese of Havana]] in 1971 reported only 7000 baptisms.&lt;ref name="Oliva, Enrique Lopez 1994"/&gt; In 1989 this figure had increased to 27,609 and in 1991 to 33,569.&lt;ref name="Oliva, Enrique Lopez 1994"/&gt;

In 1985 the [[Council of State of Cuba|Council of State]] in Havana published a best-selling book called ''Fidel y la Religion'', which was the condensed transcription of 23 hours of interviews between [[Fidel Castro]] and a Brazilian [[liberation theology]] friar named [[Frei Betto]], O.P. He claimed responsibility for excluding non-atheists from Communist Party membership on grounds that:

&lt;blockquote&gt; What we were demanding was complete adherence to Marxism-Leninism...It was assumed that anybody who joined the party would accept the party's policy and doctrine in all aspects.&lt;ref name="Oliva, Enrique Lopez 1994"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the years following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the state adopted a more conciliatory position towards religion and lessened its promotion of atheism. In November 1991 the Communist Party began to allow believers into its ranks. In July 1992, the constitution was amended to remove the definition of Cuba as being a state based on Marxism–Leninism, and article 42 was added, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of religious belief.&lt;ref name="Oliva, Enrique Lopez 1994"/&gt; Small worship centers were legally permitted to exist again. In the early 1990s, weekly church-attendance on the island of 11 million was estimated{{by whom|date=October 2013}} at around 250,000 or about 2% of the population (with an even division between Catholics and Protestants).&lt;ref name="Oliva, Enrique Lopez 1994"/&gt; Cuba had fewer priests per inhabitant than any other Latin American country.

Since 1992, restrictions have been eased, and direct challenges by state institutions to the right to believe eased somewhat, though the Roman Catholic church still faces restrictions of written and electronic communication and can only accept donations from state-approved funding sources. The Roman Catholic Church is made up of the [[Conference of Catholic Bishops of Cuba|Cuban Catholic Bishops' Conference]] (CCBC), led by [[Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino]], Cardinal Archbishop of [[Havana]]. It has eleven dioceses, 56 orders of nuns and 24 orders of priests.

The Cuban Bishops' Conference has severely criticized the US embargo against Cuba and has claimed that the entire population has suffered from it. The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] has been influenced by this and has argued for the exclusion of food and medicine from the embargo.&lt;ref name="Oliva, Enrique Lopez 1994"/&gt;

In January 1998, although he was an [[Anticommunism|anti-communist]], [[Pope John Paul II]] paid a historic visit to the island, invited by the Cuban government and the Catholic Church in Cuba. The pope criticized the US embargo during his visit.  [[Pope Benedict XVI]] visited Cuba in 2012 and [[Pope Francis]] visited in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' May 11, 2015, A4&lt;/ref&gt; In a shift in policy, the Cuban government has issued permits to allow the construction of a new church in Cuba, the first since 1959.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2015"/&gt;

On October 20, 2008, the first [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Cuba opened during an official ceremony attended by [[Raul Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santeria in Cuba==
{{see also|Afro-American religion}}
The arrival and endurance of Santeria (also known as ''Regla de Ocha'') in Cuba  results from multiple contributing factors. The roots of Santeria stem from [[Nigeria]] and were transported to Cuba by way of the [[Lucumí people]]. However, the Lucumi people only consisted of about 8% of the overall slave population in Cuba from 1760 until about 1850.&lt;ref name="Brandon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brandon |first=George |title=Santería from Africa to the New World: The Dead Sell Memories |publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington and Indianapolis|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With such low numbers to draw upon, the religion was under constant attack in the form of dilution through more dominant numbers in the form of reproductive outsourcing and the cruelty inflicted through the employment of slavery.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt;

Between 1800 and 1850 almost the entire population in Cuba consisted of people of African descent.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt; This factor created a sense of uncertainty for plantation owners because of tensions amongst the slave population. The slave rivalries eventually resulted in an ever rising loss in production. The method for combating the losses yielded that an increase in the Lucumi population would serve the plantation best. Lucumi people were known to be hard workers and mild-mannered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vega |first=Marta Moreno |title=Interlocking African Diaspora Cultures in the Work of Fernando Ortiz |journal=Journal of Black Studies |volume=31 |issue=1 |date=September 2000 |pages=39–50 |doi=10.1177/002193470003100103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As result of increasing import of slaves the population of the Lucumi rose sharply to about 34%.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt; Attributing to the increase of Santeria was that many other slaves and freemen began to practice the religion of Santeria, thereby increasing the span of influence and affiliation in a more diverse manner. The disposition of colonialism brought a significant strain on all religions outside of Catholicism. Over the course of a 90-year span, the Lucumi maintained the practice of the religion of Santeria. The religion of Santeria encompasses sacrificial food, song, dance, costumes, spiritual deities and the use of artifacts. In the beginning the Lucumi and other worshippers of Santeria would have to practice in secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Simpson |first=George Eaton |title=Black Religions in the New World |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They would create hasty areas in which they would conduct structuralized practice of Santeria and return to their colonial life after. However, the practice of Santeria on a more regular basis takes place not on the sugar plantations but in the urban areas.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt; The syncretism that modernized Santeria was introduced when high-class mulattoes needed to find ways to alleviate ailments such as stress or sickness. There was no formal medical aid available to the community at the time. In light of this disposition high-class Mulattoes pulled from whatever resources that they could find. They employed the practices of Christian-educated slaves with Afro-Cuban healers and Spanish curanderos.

The Afro-Cuban healers and Spanish [[curandero]]s served as the only medical practitioners in Cuba and were responsible for treating both the black and white population.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt; The distance between the city and the countryside made it very difficult for slaves to participate in the syncretism of Santeria with Catholicism and Christianity. This was due to geography. Most of the European religious churches were located the urban areas or towns and to attend services would require traveling over long distances, which would interfere with the sugar production.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt; In the urban areas slaves worked alongside freemen and White Cubans in a less restricted atmosphere.

They were educated and trusted to perform skilled labor and given a great deal of responsibility. They served in a number of diverse jobs, which acted as a catalyst for the syncretism of Santeria with Catholicism and Christianity.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt; Not every slave in Cuba complied with the employment of slavery. ''Cimarrones'', as the Cuban slave owners labeled them, were a group of slaves who fled captivity and formed communities consisting of thousands of people. They took refuge in the wilderness and the mountains of Cuba where they maintained the practice of Santeria. They were considered a very serious threat to the colonial government's hold on slavery and oppression.

The Cimarrones were able to elude capture and to provide aid and shelter to other escaped slaves. Over the course of time they developed the means to communicate with other surrounding secret camps via the plantation slaves and friendly White Cubans.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt; Other slaves and freemen who lived in rural areas formed secret societies and groups in which they exercised their religious beliefs of Santeria out of public view to avoid colonial reform and oppression.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt; After the abolishment of slavery Palenque, the Cimarrones establishment was converted into a town named [[El Cobre, Cuba|El Cobre]] after surviving for fifty years.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt;

In the religion of Santeria the emphasis of conscious existence binds the understanding of nature, the higher powers, and the channels of lineage together through ritual practice and clairvoyance. The circle is a symbol that is divided into three sections that begin at the core with people and extend out into two other sections being ancestors and finally divinities.&lt;ref name="Daniel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniel |first= Yvonne |title= Dancing Wisdom: Embodied knowledge in Haitian Vodou, Cuban Yoruba, and Bahian Candomblé |publisher= Frank Ward Photo |year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of people at the inner core stand to represent the present day of existence and understanding in the form of perception within the individual as he or she can interpret the information surrounding them.

The outer layer of the ancestor represents the heritable understanding that the individual carries with them as a source of how and why to interpret values of perception within a given realm. The outmost layer represents divinity is the value of knowledge, direction and understanding that is acquired from Orishas and personal experience. The existence the circle represents is not a fixed plain of understanding but stands as an interchangeable ever-evolving and rotating sense of awareness and being.&lt;ref name="Daniel"/&gt; Santeria lineage is structured in the connection through Sibs (a group of kin) with each Sib being traced back to a common male ancestor linking the bloodlines to the religion.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt; "There were three different routes for the transmission of Orisha worship. A child could inherit an Orisha from either its mother or father and continue their worship of it. In this case a triangular relationship existed between the child, the parent, and the Orisha."&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt;

==Jehovah's Witnesses==
As of 2016, there were about 96,000 active [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] in [[Cuba]] (about 0.85% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/2017-yearbook/jehovahs-witnesses-service-report-2016/|title=2017 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/worldwide/CU/ |title=Jehovah’s Witnesses Around the World: Cuba |publisher=Watchtower |date= |accessdate=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1938 to 1947, the number of Jehovah's Witnesses in Cuba increased from about 100 to 4,000.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1388816| jstor = 1388816| title = Organizational Change and Religious Commitment: Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh-Day Adventists in Cuba, 1938-1965| journal = The Pacific Sociological Review| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 171| year = 1980| last1 = Aguirre | first1 = B.

A branch office of Jehovah's Witnesses, with a print shop, was opened in Havana in the same year. In 1998, Witnesses were permitted to meet at larger conventions in major cities in Cuba.

A '''religious denomination''' is a subgroup within a [[religion]] that operates under a common name, tradition, and identity.
[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|500px|Major denominations and religions of the world.]]
The term refers to the various [[Christian denomination]]s (for example, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and the many varieties of [[Protestantism]]). It is also used to describe the four branches of [[Judaism]] ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]]). Within Islam, it can refer to the branches or sects (such as [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], [[Shia Islam|Shia]], and [[Ahmadiyya]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aaron W.

== Christianity ==
{{Main|Christian denomination}}
{{Main list|List of Christian denominations}}

A [[Christian denomination]] is a generic term for a distinct religious body identified by traits such as a common name, structure, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by doctrine and church authority; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy often separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are known as branches of [[Christianity]].

==Hinduism==
{{further|History of Hinduism|Hindu denominations}}
In [[Hinduism]], the major deity or philosophical belief identifies a denomination, which also typically has distinct cultural and religious practices. The major denominations include [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Smartism]].

==Islam==
{{further|History of Islam|Muslim denominations}}

[[History of Islam|Historically]], Islam was divided into three major sects well known as [[Sunni]], [[Khawarij]] and [[Shī‘ah]].

==Judaism==
{{main|Jewish religious movements}}

Jewish religious movements, sometimes called "denominations" or "branches", include different groups which have developed among [[Jew]]s from ancient times. Today, the main division is between the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] lines, with several smaller movements alongside them. This threefold denominational structure is mainly present in the United States, while in Israel the fault lines are between the religious Orthodox and the [[Jewish secularism|non-religious]].

The movements differ in their views on various issues. These issues include the level of observance, the methodology for interpreting and understanding [[Halakha|Jewish law]], [[Historical criticism|biblical authorship]], [[textual criticism]], and the nature or role of [[Messiah in Judaism|the messiah]] (or [[messianic age]]). Across these movements there are marked differences in [[Jewish services|liturgy]], especially in the language in which services are conducted, with the more traditional movements emphasizing Hebrew. The sharpest theological division occurs between Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews who adhere to other denominations, such that the non-Orthodox movements are sometimes referred to collectively as the "liberal denominations" or "progressive streams."

==Multi-denominational==
The term "multi-denominational" may describe (for example) a [[religious]] event that includes several religious denominations from sometimes unrelated religious groups. Many [[civic engagement|civic]] events include religious portions led by representatives from several religious denominations to be as inclusive or representational as possible of the expected population or audience.  For example: the Sunday [[thanksgiving]] mass at Campamento Esperanza (English: [[Camp Hope]]) in [[Chile]], where [[Church service|services]] were led by both a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] and by an [[Evangelical]] [[preacher]] during the [[Chile]]an [[2010 Copiapó mining accident]].&lt;ref name=sundaymassbbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11561355 Chile mine: Rescued men attend service of thanks], BBC News, 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sundaymass&gt;{{cite web |last= Raphael |first=Angie |url= http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/freed-miners-return-to-camp-hope/story-e6frf7jx-1225939966063 |title= Freed miners return to Chile's Camp Hope|publisher= Herald Sun |date= 18 October 2010 |accessdate= 18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chaplains]] - frequently [[ordained]] [[clergy]] of any [[religion]] - are often assigned{{by whom|date=January 2015}} to [[secular]] organizations to provide [[Spirituality|spiritual]] support to its members who may belong to any of many different religions or denominations.  Many of these chaplains, particularly those serving with the [[military]] or other large secular organizations, are specifically trained to minister to members of many different faiths, even faiths with opposing religious [[ideology]] from that of the chaplain's own faith.&lt;ref name=prisonchap&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0712/S00172.htm Christmas in Prison - A Quiet One], Independent News, New Zealand, Press Release: Department Of Corrections, 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Military organizations that do not have large numbers of members from several individual smaller but related denominations will routinely hold multi-denominational religious services, often generically called "[[Protestant]]" Sunday services, so minority Protestant denominations are not left out or unserved.&lt;ref name=obamachurch&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4792">'''C. René Padilla''' (born 1932) is an [[Ecuadorians|Ecuadorian]] [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Theology|theologian]] and [[Missiology|missiologist]] known for coining the term ''[[integral mission]]'' ({{Lang-es|misión integral}}) in the 1970s to articulate Christianity's dual priority in evangelism and social activism. He would popularize this term in Latin American evangelicalism through the [[Latin American Theological Fellowship]] and through global evangelicalism through the [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne Conference]] of 1974.

== Life ==
Padilla was born into a poor family in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], in 1932. Due to the [[Great Depression]], his family would move when he was two years old to [[Colombia]], where he would grow up.&lt;ref name="Marks2008" /&gt; He would later pursue a BA in philosophy and a MA in theology at [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]], before continuing on to complete a PhD in the New Testament from the [[University of Manchester]], under [[F. F. Bruce]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theworkofthepeople.com/person/rene-padilla|title=René Padilla|last=|first=|date=|website=The Work Of The People|publisher=|access-date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His education and experiences with [[InterVarsity Christian Fellowship]] underscored Padilla's evangelical foundations and the priority he would place on the [[Historical criticism|historical-critical approach]] to [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name="Marks2008"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjnJCnZQwY0C&amp;pg=PA127|title=Shaping a Global Theological Mind|last=Padilla|first=C.

In his work with universities throughout Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador, Padilla would be faced with a tense sociopolitical context. Students were immersed in Marxist writings and grappled with the possibility of revolution. This would be the context which produced not only [[Liberation theology#Latin American liberation theology|Catholic liberation theology]], but also challenged Padilla to develop a new evangelical social theology which he would later term "[[integral mission]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David C.|date=April 2016|year=|title=C.

Padilla would bring his ideas to the global stage at the [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne Conference]] of 1974.&lt;ref name="GreenmanGreen2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxdsAQgn9z8C&amp;pg=PA74|title=Global Theology in Evangelical Perspective: Exploring the Contextual Nature of Theology and Mission|last=Escobar|first=Samuel|publisher=InterVarsity Press|others=Gene L.

In 1992, Padilla would receive an honorary [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree from Wheaton College.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He is the father of the theologian [[Ruth Padilla DeBorst]].

[[File:Mahmud in robe from the caliph.jpg|thumb|[[Mahmud of Ghazni]] dons a robe of honour sent by Caliph [[al-Qadir]]]]
A '''robe of honour''' ([[Arabic]]: ''khilʿa'' or ''tashrīf'') was a term designating rich garments given by medieval and early modern Islamic rulers to subjects as tokens of honour, often as part of a ceremony of appointment to a public post, or as a token of confirmation or acceptance of vassalage of a subordinate ruler. They were usually produced in government factories and decorated with the inscribed bands known as ''[[tiraz|ṭirāz]]''.

It is located in the middle of the place earlier known as Koladvipa. The Math has been continuing as a famous religious spot thronged by thousands of devotees every year.

==History==

In 1940,&lt;ref&gt;Bryant&amp;Ekstrand, 2004. p. 118-122&lt;/ref&gt; after jagad-guru [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura|Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura Prabhupada]] entered aprakata-lila, one of his intimate associates, [[Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Goswami|Srila Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Gosvami Maharaja]], established [[Sri Gaudiya Vedanta Samiti]] (GVS) &lt;ref&gt;Bryant&amp;Ekstrand, 2004.p 76-80&lt;/ref&gt; in a rented building.  He later purchased an extensive piece of land on which he established a matha with a beautiful temple.

==Inside the Temple==

The following deities preside in the five chambers of the temple and samadhi mandir respectively:
 
'''Temple'''
* [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura|Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura Prabhupada]], 
* [[Sri Gauranga]] and Sri Radha-Vinoda-bihari, and 
* [[Varaha|Sri Koladeva]], or [[Varaha]]deva, the presiding deity of Sri Koladvipa.

'''Samadhi'''
* [[Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Goswami|Srila Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Gosvami Maharaja]]
* Srila Bhaktivedanta Vamana Gosvami Maharaja

==Nava-vidha Bhakti==
[[Image:Brahma_Madhya_Gaudiya_Tilaka.svg|right|thumb|160px|The Brahma Madhya Gaudiya Tilaka, a mark usually worn by the Gaudiya Vaishnavas on forehead.]]
The temple's nine towers each represent one limb of nava-vidha-bhakti, the nine types of devotional 
service.

* Hearing, 
* Chanting, 
* Remembering, 
* Serving the Lord's lotus feet, 
* Worshipping, 
* Offering prayers, 
* Engaging as a servant, 
* Serving as a friend, and 
* Completely surrendering oneself.

==Nava-vidha Khandas==
[[Image:Sri Gauranga and Sri Radha-Vinoda-bihari.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The deities of the Mandir - Gauranga and Sri Radha-Vinoda-bihari, [[Nabadwip]], West Bengal]]

The matha is divided into the following nine parts (khandas):

* Paramartha-khanda - the printing press where devotional literature and magazines are produced.
* Kirtana-khanda - the place where sankirtana, lectures on Bhagavatam and other scriptures take place. 
* Upasya-khanda - the temple where the deities of Srila Sarasvati Thakura Prabhupada, Sri Gauranga, Sri Radha-Vinona-bihari and Sri Koladeva are worshipped.
* Sevaka-khanda - the place where the residents of the matha live.
* Bhoga-khanda - the storehouse and kitchen.
* Govardhana-khanda - the cow shed.
* Vaisnnava-granthagara-khanda - the library.
* Udayana-Khanda - the garden.
* Jnana-khanda - the bathrooms and latrines.

These sections are divided on the basis of activities favourable to [[bhakti]], which are to be accepted and those unfavourable which are to be avoided. [[Jnana]] and [[karma]] which are devoid of bhakti are always to be rejected just as one rejects stools. For this reason the bathrooms and latrines of the matha are called Jnana-khanda.

It was Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami's long-held desire that a deity of Sri Koladeva be established on the Ganga's western bank in the old Kuliya-nagara. To fulfill this desire, Srila 
Bhakti Prajnana kesava Gosvami Maharaja has manifested the service of Sri Koladeva at the place.

==The Past and the Present==

* [[Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Goswami|Srila Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Gosvami Maharaja]] - Founder Acharya.

'''{{lang|it|Tarantella}}''' ({{IPA-it|taranˈtɛlla}}) is a group of various  [[Italian folk dance|folk dances]] characterized by a fast upbeat tempo, usually in [[Time signature|{{music|time|6|8}} time]] (sometimes {{music|time|12|8}} or {{music|time|4|4}}), accompanied by [[tambourine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Morehead, P.D., ''Bloomsbury Dictionary of Music'', London, Bloomsbury, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; It is among the most recognized forms of traditional southern Italian music. The specific dance-name varies with every region, for instance ''[[tammurriata]]'' in [[Campania]], ''[[pizzica]]'' in the [[Salento]] region, [[Calabrian Tarantella|''Sonu a ballu'']] in Calabria. Tarantella is popular in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Argentina]]. The term may appear as '''{{lang|it|tarantello}}''' in a [[Gender (linguistics)|linguistically masculine]] construction.
&lt;!-- There is mention in the article on Taranto that its name derives from an exorcism ritual, which seems rather improbable.  John T. La Barbera may have picked up a myth here.
The term "tarantella" originally referred to an exorcism ritual that existed in Greece around the year 2000 BC and was connected to the gods [[Dionysus]] and [[Apollo]] (the Greek gods of wine and music). It continued on in [[southern Italy]], an area known as [[Magna Grecia]] (greater Greece).&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Apollon Mokritsky Rim Italyanki na Terrase 1846.jpg|thumb|Italian women dance the tarantella, 1846]]

In the Italian [[province of Taranto]], [[Apulia]], the bite of a locally common type of [[Lycosa tarantula|wolf spider]], named "tarantula" after the region,&lt;ref&gt;[[Linnaeus]] named the spider ''[[Lycosa tarantula]]'' in 1758.&lt;/ref&gt; was popularly believed to be highly venomous and to lead to a hysterical condition known as [[tarantism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22646978 |title=POISONOUS SPIDER BITES. |newspaper=[[The Queenslander]] |date=8 September 1923 |accessdate=1 September 2013 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the Tarantella. R. Lowe Thompson proposed that the dance is a survival from a "[[Diana (goddess)|Dianic]] or [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] cult", driven underground.&lt;ref&gt;R.Lowe Thompson. ''The History of the Devil''. Paul, Trench, Tubner and Co. (1929), p.164.&lt;/ref&gt; John Compton later proposed that the [[Roman Senate]] had suppressed  these ancient [[Bacchanalian]] [[rite]]s. In 186 BC the tarantella went underground, reappearing under the guise of emergency therapy for bite victims.&lt;ref&gt;John Compton. ''The Life of the Spider''. Mentor Books (1954), p. 56f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courtship vs tarantism dances==
The stately courtship tarantella danced by a couple or couples, short in duration, is graceful and elegant and features characteristic music.  On the other hand, the supposedly curative or symptomatic tarantella was danced solo by a victim of a ''[[Lycosa tarantula]]'' spider bite (not to be confused with what is commonly known as a [[tarantula]] today); it was agitated in character, lasted for hours or even up to days, and featured characteristic music. However, other forms of the dance were and still are couple dances usually either mimicking courtship or a sword fight. The confusion appears to arrive from the fact that the spiders, the condition, its sufferers ('tarantolati'), and the dances all have similar names to the city of [[Taranto]].&lt;ref name="Toschi"&gt;Toschi, Paolo (1950). Proceedings of the Congress Held in Venice September 7th to 11th, 1949: "A Question about the Tarantella", ''Journal of the International Folk Music Council'', Vol. 2. (1950), p. 19. Translated by N. F.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance originated in the [[Apulia]] region, and spread throughout the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].
The Neapolitan tarantella is a [[courtship dance]] performed by couples whose  "rhythms, melodies, gestures, and accompanying songs are quite distinct" featuring faster more cheerful music. Its origins may further lie in "a fifteenth-century fusion between the Spanish [[Fandango]] and the [[Moresca|Moresque]] 'ballo di sfessartia'." 
The "magico-religious" tarantella is a solo dance performed supposedly to cure through perspiration the delirium and contortions attributed to the bite of a spider at harvest (summer) time. The dance was later applied as a supposed cure for the behavior of neurotic women ('Carnevaletto delle donne').&lt;ref name="Ettlinger"&gt;Ettlinger, Ellen (1965). Review of "La Tarantella Napoletana" by Renato Penna (''Rivista di Etnografia''), ''Man'', Vol. 65. (Sep. – Oct., 1965), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several traditional tarantella groups: '[[Cantori di Carpino]]', '[[Officina Zoé]]', 'Uccio Aloisi gruppu', 'Canzoniere Grecanico Salentino', 'Selva Cupina', 'I Tamburellisti di Torrepaduli'.

The tarantella is most commonly played with a [[mandolin]], a guitar, an [[accordion]] and [[tambourines]]. [[Flute]], [[fiddle]], [[trumpet]] and [[clarinet]] are also used.

The tarantella is a dance in which the dancer and the drum player constantly try to upstage each other by playing faster or dancing longer than the other, subsequently tiring one person out first.

==Tarantism==
{{Main|Tarantism}}
Tarantism, as a ritual, has roots in the ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]]. Reportedly, victims who had collapsed or were convulsing would begin to dance with appropriate music and be revived as if a tarantula had bitten them. The music used to treat [[dancing mania]] appears to be similar to that used in the case of tarantism though little is known about either. [[Justus Hecker]] (1795–1850), describes in his work ''Epidemics of the Middle Ages'': &lt;blockquote&gt;A convulsion infuriated the human frame [...]. Entire communities of people would join hands, dance, leap, scream, and shake for hours [...]. Music appeared to be the only means of combating the strange epidemic [...] lively, shrill tunes, played on trumpets and fifes, excited the dancers; soft, calm harmonies, graduated from fast to slow, high to low, prove efficacious for the cure.&lt;ref&gt;Hecker, Justus. Quoted in Sear, H. G. (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The music used against spider bites featured drums and clarinets, was matched to the pace of the victim, and is only weakly connected to its later depiction in the tarantellas of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], and Heller.&lt;ref&gt;Sear, H. G. (1939). "Music and Medicine", p.45, ''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 20, No. 1. (Jan., 1939), pp. 43–54. Note that Sear may mistake the Neapolitan and Apulian tarantellas and that those by Romantic composers to which he refers may have been intended as Neapolitan.&lt;/ref&gt;

While most serious proponents speculated as to the direct physical benefits of the dancing rather than the power of the music a mid-18th century medical textbook gets the prevailing story backwards describing that tarantulas will be compelled to dance by violin music.&lt;ref name="Rishton"/&gt; It was thought that the ''Lycosa tarantula'' [[wolf spider]] had lent the name "tarantula" to [[tarantula|an unrelated family of spiders]], having been the species associated with Taranto, but since ''L. tarantula'' is not inherently deadly,&lt;ref name="Rishton"&gt;[[Tim Rishton|Rishton, Timothy J.]] (1984). "Plagiarism, Fiddles and Tarantulas", ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 125, No. 1696. (Jun., 1984), pp. 325–327.&lt;/ref&gt; the highly venomous Mediterranean black widow, ''[[Latrodectus tredecimguttatus]]'', may have been the species originally associated with Taranto's manual grain harvest.

==''Tarantella'' ballet==
The Balanchine ballet [[Tarantella (ballet)|''Tarantella'']] is set to the  ''[[Grande Tarantelle (Gottschalk)|Grande Tarantelle]] for Piano and Orchestra'', Op. 67 (ca. 1866) by [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]], reconstructed and orchestrated by [[Hershy Kay]]. The profusion of steps and the quick changes of direction that this brief but explosive pas de deux requires typify the ways in which Balanchine expanded the traditional vocabulary of classical dance.

'''Temperance''' "'''Bones'''" '''Brennan, Ph.D.''' (born '''Joy Keenan''') is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] portrayed by [[Emily Deschanel]] in the American [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]''.  An [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], [[Forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologist]], and [[Kinesiology|kinesiologist]], she is described in the series as a leading [[authority]] in the field of [[forensic anthropology]]. Brennan first appeared on television, along with other series characters, in the "[[Pilot (Bones)|Pilot]]" episode of ''Bones'' on September 13, 2005. She is the main protagonist of the series along with FBI Special Agent [[Seeley Booth]] ([[David Boreanaz]]).

Brennan is loosely based on author [[Kathy Reichs]].

==Character history==
Temperance "Bones" Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who works in the Medico-Legal lab at the Jeffersonian Institute in Washington, D.C. She received her Ph.D. from [[Northwestern University]], as stated in "The Girl in the Fridge". She has three doctorates, as referred to by Dr. Jack Hodgins in the episode "The Parts of the Sum in the Whole", in [[anthropology]], [[forensic anthropology]] and [[kinesiology]]; it is implied that most of her work at the lab was related to either long-dead bodies or victims of [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="Pilot"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Pilot|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 1|number=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parts in the Sum"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Parts in the Sum of the Whole|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= 2010-04-08|season= 5|number= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her occasional contract work for the FBI shifted the focus of her work.&lt;ref name="Parts in the Sum"/&gt;  She was paired with FBI Special Agent [[Seeley Booth]], and helped to solve two difficult cases;&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parts in the Sum"/&gt; since then, they have worked together almost exclusively on modern-day murder cases.

Brennan works with a group of other well-qualified colleagues, including the [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Jack Hodgins (Bones)|Jack Hodgins]], her boss and [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] [[Camille Saroyan]], [[forensic art]]ist [[Angela Montenegro]], and a host of eager graduate students. Booth refers to her crew of colleagues as "squints", because they come to crime scenes and squint at evidence.  He is also responsible for her nickname, "Bones", which she initially detested.&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt;

In the first-season finale (which aired on May 17, 2006), Brennan stated that she was born in 1976,&lt;ref name="Woman in Limbo"/&gt; which would have made her either 29 or 30 (approximately the same age as Deschanel, who was born on October 11, 1976). In the fifth-season episode "The Death of the Queen Bee" (which aired nearly four years later, on April 15, 2010), it is implied that her then-current age was 33 years (based on Brennan's identification of a former high school classmate as the victim and statement that the classmate was 33).

First mentioned in season 1, Brennan has a love of dolphins, which she shared with her late mother: in the season one finale, "The Woman in Limbo", Brennan examines a custom-made belt with a dolphin on the buckle, which had belonged to her mother, and which she mentions having once borrowed without asking first.  Brennan's love of dolphins is highlighted again in season 2 episodes "The Titan on the Tracks", "The Killer in the Concrete" and "Stargazer in a Puddle", when she mentions the constellation [[Delphinus]], (the Dolphin), her and her mother's favorite. In season 6, "The Doctor in the Photo", she is shown to wear a dolphin ring.

In "Mummy in the Maze", Brennan exhibited [[ophidiophobia]] when confronted with snakes, but later only shows a moment of fright when confronted with another snake in "The Mastodon in the Room". She takes note of this, voicing her observation that she only seems to lose her head around snakes when Booth is also "there to be jumped upon", and also she mentions that she once had a pet snake during high school. It should also be noted that, in "The Man in the Morgue," Brennan handled a snake without any trace of fear, even while Booth is in the room.

In season one, in "A Man on Death Row", Dr. Brennan expresses her stance on the [[death penalty]]; "I believe in the death penalty. There are certain people who shouldn't be in this world. The people who [[Rwandan genocide|hacked hundreds of innocent children to death]] in [[Rwanda]]; beheaded them at their desks at school! The people who did that, they should be executed."  In "The Woman at the Airport", Dr. Brennan is shown to have a strong dislike for [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeons]], believing them to be no more than "glorified butchers with medical degrees", and this dislike is voiced again in [[Bones (season 4)|season 4]], in "Cinderella in the Cardboard".  In "The Woman in the Car", Dr. Brennan reveals that her third doctorate is in [[kinesiology]], a field that would allow her and Angela to unravel how one of the bodies that had been found had been killed.

In season two, she expressed the desire to get a pet pig, whom she would have named "Jasper".  Brennan's expertise in [[kinesiology]] would again prove its worth in "The Truth in the Lye" (she could tell that one of the murder suspects was pregnant just from having observed her [[Gait (human)|gait]]), in "The Girl with the Curl" (she could tell if one of the young beauty pageant contestants was suffering from [[scoliosis]] just by watching them perform on stage), and in "The Woman in the Sand" (while undercover with Booth, she was able to tell Booth exactly how to beat his opponent from just having watched his moves).  In "Judas on a Pole", she and her brother are identified as having the same [[blood type]], blood type O.  In "Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House", she is shown to be a good cook: Booth's comment on her [[Macaroni and cheese|mac and cheese]] is that he'd "like to be alone with it".

In the season 3 episode, "Mummy in the Maze", it is revealed that Brennan's favorite [[superhero]] is [[Wonder Woman]], and that she always goes as Wonder Woman to the Jeffersonian's [[Halloween]] party.  In "The Baby in the Bough", it is revealed that Brennan is a registered [[foster parent]], at her brother's request, to take in his stepdaughters in case anything should happen to him and his girlfriend.  In the season 3 episode, "Intern in the Incinerator", Booth reveals that Brennan's favorite flower is a [[Daffodil]], her second favorite flower is a [[Asteraceae|Daisy]], and her favorite planet is [[Jupiter]].

In season 5, in "The Death of the Queen Bee", when asked if she'd had a pet rat, Brennan discloses that she, in fact, had a pet mouse, snake and some spiders.  During her time at [[Tim Burton|Burtonsville]] high school, her only friend was the school custodian, [[Robert Englund|Ray Buxley]], with whom she would enjoy long, in-depth conversations on life and death, and who would also provide her with dead animals to dissect (Brennan having set out to become a [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologist]],) and who would later be one of her books' biggest fans (she having named the killer in her first book, ''Bred in the Bone'', after him).  According to the Burtonsville high school on-line [[yearbook]] entry on Brennan, in her senior year, she was a member of the [[Chemistry]] club and [[mathematics|Math]] club, her interests were chemistry and mathematics, and she was a [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholar]] and an Academic All Star.

In the season 6 episode, "The Blackout in the Blizzard", Brennan mentions her pet iguana for the first time.  This same episode show that one of the number of scientific publications that Brennan reads is ''Medicinal Physics Quarterly'', with one article on [[electrostatic]]s and triboluminescence proving useful during the lab's power outage.  Further concerning her pet iguana in "The Truth in the Myth", as a part of his rehab from alcohol abuse, Vincent Nigel-Murry made apologies for, among other things, having borrowed her iguana one night, wearing him as a hat for a party. She comments that he must have taken good care of her iguana as she has observed nothing wrong with him and further expresses some surprise that Vincent Nigel-Murry was able to get her iguana to stay perched atop his head, to which he replies that he was good with ribbons.

In season 8, "The Tiger in the Tale", Booth mentions to Sweets that Dr. Brennan once took [[Peyote]] with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].

In season 11, "The Senator in the Street Sweeper", Dr. Brennan is mentioned to be a member of the [[Green Party of the United States]] along with Dr. Hodgins.

===Family and early life===
Although Brennan seemed to have a relatively normal childhood, her parents disappeared when she was 15 years old.&lt;ref name="Fallout Shelter"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Man in the Fallout Shelter |series=Bones|airdate=2005-12-13 |season=1 |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her older brother [[List of Bones characters#Russ Brennan|Russ]], himself still an adolescent, was unable to care for her and she was put in the foster care system. By the time she started college she had been to twelve different schools and has specifically said that she hated the lack of consistency.&lt;ref name="Guck"/&gt;

There has been contradictory evidence about her time in the system; in one episode, Brennan stated that her grandfather got her out of the foster system,&lt;ref name="Boy in a Bush"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= A Boy in a Bush|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate=2005-11-08 |season= 1|number= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in a later episode, she indicates that she never knew her grandparents (possibly the two references are to two separate sets of grandparents, [[paternal]] and [[maternal]]).&lt;ref name="Stargazer"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Stargazer in the Puddle|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= 2007-05-16|season= 2|number= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, taking into consideration the fact that Brennan's parents had assumed new identities when she was 3-years-old, the grandfather who had taken her in from her time in the foster system may not have been her biological grandfather.

Her time in foster care was quite [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] and abusive; Brennan indicated that she was once locked in the trunk of a car for two days because she broke a plate,&lt;ref name="Mayhem"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Mayhem on the Cross|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=4 |number=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the episode "The Finger in the Nest", she reveals to Booth that she walked into her elderly neighbor's house to find the woman dead. In the same episode, she also mentions to Booth that her parents were very concerned about her afterwards, because she started faking her own death.  In Season 2, she mentions that during her time in the foster care system, she kept a list of foster homes she had been kicked out of on the bottom of her shoe.

In the first season she hands Booth the file on her parents' disappearance and he agrees to look into it as a personal favor.&lt;ref name="The Man on the Fairway"&gt;{{Cite episode | title=The Man on the Fairway|episodelink=Bones (season 1)#ep14|series=Bones|serieslink= Bones (TV series)| network= Fox| airdate=March 8, 2006| season=1|number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed in Season 2 that her parents, who were bank robbers specializing in [[safety deposit box]]es, changed the family's identity after they stole some damaging FBI documents regarding the murder of an FBI agent and the false imprisonment of civil rights activist Marvin Beckett. Brennan's birth name was Joy Keenan.&lt;ref name="Woman in Limbo"/&gt; Her mother (real name Ruth Keenan, known under the assumed identity of Christine Brennan) had hoped to someday return to her children and family, but made a tape for Brennan to watch on her 16th birthday in case that never happened.  Brennan later discovered that Ruth/Christine was murdered in 1993, two years after she and her husband went on the run.

Her father [[List of Bones characters#Matthew Brennan / Max Keenan|Max Keenan]] re-entered Brennan's life when she and her brother were being threatened by an old acquaintance, who turned out to be Booth's boss, Deputy Director Kirby.&lt;ref name="Judas on a Pole"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Judas on a Pole |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=2 |number=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max evades capture after killing Kirby, and takes Russ into hiding to protect him.&lt;ref name="Judas on a Pole"/&gt;  Later, Max allows Booth to arrest him in order to improve his relationship with his daughter.&lt;ref name="Stargazer"/&gt;  At trial, Max is acquitted of murdering Director Kirby (due in large part to a defense Booth indirectly came up with, positing an alternate theory of the crime in which Temperance was the killer instead, creating reasonable doubt), and he begins to rebuild his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Verdict in the Story |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 3|number= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He temporarily works at the Jeffersonian as a guide for children visiting the place and demonstrates his brilliant talent as a former science teacher. However, Brennan is concerned about a convicted felon having access to a lab that investigates crimes.&lt;ref name="Bones that Blew"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Bones that Blew |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 4|number=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Max also introduces Brennan to her cousin [[List of Bones characters#Margaret Whitesell|Margaret Whitesell]],&lt;ref name="Goop on the Girl"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Goop on the Girl |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 5|number= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; portrayed by Deschanel's real-life sister [[Zooey Deschanel]].

Brennan is best friends with her coworker, Angela, saying in the 6th-season premiere she loves Angela "like a sister" and is going to be an aunt to Hodgins' and Angela's newborn child. It is revealed at the end of the season six finale "The Change in the Game" that Brennan is pregnant and the father is Booth.

In Season 7, episode 2 "The Hot Dog in the Competition", Brennan and Booth found out they were having a baby girl. Their daughter, Christine Angela Booth (named for Brennan's mother and her best friend), was born in a stable during the episode "The Prisoner in the Pipe".  In the Season 7 finale, "The Past in the Present", key evidence in the death of her friend, Ethan Sawyer, is linked to Brennan. [[List of Bones characters#Matthew Brennan / Max Keenan|Max]] convinces her to go on the run along with Christine, saying that if she is arrested, even if she is found innocent, she may never see her daughter again.

In Season 8 premiere, it is revealed that while on the run, Brennan was communicating with Angela, via [[Language of flowers|flowers]], and eventually used this as a way to communicate with Booth. Despite being on the run, Brennan risks her safety and decides to meet directly with Booth in a hotel room after months of being a single mother. Eventually, they arrest Christopher Pelant, who was the real murderer of Ethan Sawyer, and Brennan is allowed to return to her family. Although Pelant blackmails Booth to prevent him from accepting Brennan's proposal by threatening to kill five innocent people if Booth accepted, also warning Booth not to give a reason for his refusal, this threat is removed when the team manage to kill Pelant, and Booth and Brennan marry in the Season 9 episode 'The Woman in White'.

In the Season 10 episode, "The Eye in the Sky", Brennan learns that she is pregnant with her and Booth's second child.

==Characterization==
Throughout the course of the series, Brennan is portrayed as a straightforward, brilliant anthropologist, who lacks social skills. Her social ineptitude is especially apparent when it comes to sarcasm, metaphors which she often interprets literally, and pop culture jokes and is often the source of comedy in the show.&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; An example of this is when she mistakes [[Colin Farrell]] for [[Will Ferrell]].&lt;ref name="Boy in a Bush"/&gt; In earlier seasons, she was characterized as straightforward and unable to detect social cues – she states that Booth once told her that she "stinks at non-verbal communication"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Fire in the Ice|episodelink=Bones (season 4)#ep71|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=January 22, 2009|season=4|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and was well-known within the FBI for being extremely difficult to work with. She began to acknowledge her lack of sensitivity after Booth bluntly told her outright that she was "bad with people" in "[[A Boy in a Tree]]". Her lack of "political savvy" and social skills was also a reason why she was passed over for Dr. Camille Saroyan as head of the Jeffersonian in Season 2. Other characters have described her as "no fun"&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt; and "a rigid traditionalist".&lt;ref name="Guck"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Geek in the Guck |series= Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|episodelink=Bones (season 10)#ep194|network= Fox|airdate=October 16, 2014 |season=10|number= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a difficult adolescence, and it is implied, often by Sweets, that her withdrawn social tendencies are a defense mechanism. She also sometimes struggles in identifying and explaining her emotions, and takes comfort in the rationality of her anthropological discipline. Although it has been stated that Brennan was based on a person with [[Asperger syndrome]], this has never been confirmed in the plot of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ellen |last=Gray |url=http://www.philly.com/dailynews/columnists/ellen_gray/20070131_Ellen_Gray___Boreanaz_says__Bones__is_not_procedural.html |title=Boreanaz says 'Bones' is not procedural |date=31 January 2007 |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creator of the series has stated that the character was never labeled as having the syndrome in order to increase the appeal of the show on network television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alan |last=Sepinwall |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/02/how_tv_shows_try_or_choose_not.html |title=How TV shows try (or choose not) to depict Asperger's syndrome |accessdate=2010-03-01 |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |location=Newark, N.J. |date=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This influence on her character also helps to explain her extreme rationality in early seasons, as well as some of her social difficulties. Brennan is a self-proclaimed atheist and often points out what she believes to be the irrationality of religious and spiritual beliefs.  This has led to more than one argument with Booth, who is a devout Roman Catholic; he becomes particularly irate when she compares less common religions, such as [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]], to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Man in the Morgue"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Man in the Morgue|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= 2006-04-16|season= 1|number= 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' crossover episode "Dead Men Tell No Tales", ''Sleepy Hollow'' protagonist Ichabod Crane notes that Brennan is so sceptical that she would dismiss the demon Moloch &amp;mdash; the primary antagonist in the first two seasons of ''Sleepy Hollow'' &amp;mdash; as nothing more than a tall man with a skin condition, although this does leave him reassured that she will not realise the nature of the secret tomb they have uncovered underneath the White House.

Brennan is a bestselling author, who has been on the [[The New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' Best Seller List]] for 18 weeks.&lt;ref name="Wannabe"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Wannabe in the Weeds|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate=2008-05-12|season=2 |number= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is trained in three types of martial arts,&lt;ref name="Man in the Morgue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aliens in the Spaceship"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Aliens in the Spaceship |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=2 |number=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has hunting licenses in four states,&lt;ref name="Man in the Morgue"/&gt; and has a legally registered gun&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; as well as a diving certificate.&lt;ref name="The Man with the Bone"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Man with the Bone|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 1|number= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She promised to consider becoming a vegetarian after seeing how pigs were slaughtered (which was also the way her mother had been killed).&lt;ref name="Woman in Limbo"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Woman in Limbo|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 1|number= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in "The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken" (season 5, episode 6) Angela cites health reasons for Brennan's vegetarian diet.  Brennan is also a trained amateur [[tightrope walker|highwire performer]],&lt;ref name="Double Trouble"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Double Trouble in the Panhandle |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 4|number= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speaks at least seven other languages, including Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Woman in the Garden|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 1|number= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; Latin,&lt;ref name="Boy in a Tree"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= A Boy in a Tree |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=1 |number= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese,&lt;ref name="Bride in the River"/&gt; Pashto&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Source in the Sludge|series=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=|season=9|number=16|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese,&lt;ref name="Girl in the Mask"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Girl in the Mask |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 4|number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian (although she says only "skull" and avers that, as a forensic anthropologist, this is a word she knows "in just about every language"),&lt;ref name="Mayhem"/&gt; Farsi, and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Blonde in the Game|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=2 |number= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has also admitted to knowing a bit of Russian.&lt;ref name="Double Trouble"/&gt; She often says she does not "put much stock in psychology" and makes a point of noting that Dr. Sweets is not a real scientist as he "bases his life on the vagary of psychology and emotions".

Brennan's personality undergoes significant changes throughout the course of the series. Her thinking becomes less rigid in later seasons, something which is observed by Dr. Gordon Wyatt, who notes that she is now able to distinguish the difference between accuracy and truth.&lt;ref name="Dwarf in the Dirt"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Dwarf in the Dirt|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 5|number=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In season 4, Booth takes her along to his interrogations and helps her learn how to set aside her scientific perspective and relate with the victim's family and suspects on a more interpersonal level. She is also able to put aside her rationality to support her friends in sometimes irrational pursuits, such as Angela's quest to raise money to save a pig from slaughter,&lt;ref name="Tender Chicken"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken |series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=5 |number= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to comfort Booth, even using science or quoting directly from the Bible to rationalize his religious beliefs. Her sensitivity and empathy towards others are also much improved, seen quite strongly when she comforts his grandfather,&lt;ref name="Foot in the Foreclosure"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Foot in the Foreclosure"|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season= 5|number= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when she attends a funeral so that the victim's single mother won't be alone.&lt;ref name="Goop on the Girl"/&gt; She also displays more "typical" human emotions when in extreme stress. One example of this is her fear of snakes in "The Mummy in the Maze," when a girl is in the process of being scared to death in a room, the floor teeming with snakes. This goes against her empirical nature, as, when Booth tells her that the snakes aren't venomous, she states that she is aware, but still refuses to step in the room, causing Booth to carry her on his back.

Brennan begins to feel both dissatisfaction and discomfort with her work toward the end of the fifth season.&lt;ref name="Boy with the Answer"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Boy with the Answer|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=5 |number= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also sees some futility in her work, stating that no matter how many killers they catch, there will always be more.&lt;ref name="Beginning in the End"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Beginning in the End|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= |season=5 |number=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To help her gain new perspective, she later decides to head up an anthropological expedition to Indonesia for a year to identify some ancient proto-human remains, after mulling it over during the episode.&lt;ref name="Beginning in the End"/&gt; However, 7 months later, she and everyone else return to D.C. in order to save Cam's job, and they all decide to stay.

As season 6 progresses, Brennan must confront her feelings for Booth, whom she rejected in the 100th episode from the previous season. Having returned from 7 months of introspection, she has come to terms with her romantic affection towards him, even admitting that she regretted not having given them a chance together, midway through the season. However, Booth returns from Afghanistan with a new love interest, war correspondent Hannah Burley, whom Brennan befriends. When Hannah rejects Booth's marriage proposal, Brennan must help him through the emotional fallout.

In the second to last episode of season 6 Booth and Brennan had sex, consummating their relationship, and it is revealed in the last few moments of the season finale that as a result, Brennan has become pregnant, with Booth the father. Throughout the episode ("The Change in the Game") Brennan has been seen asking Angela questions and making comments that make her seem excited and apprehensive; when she sees that Booth is happy with the news, she also seems overjoyed. This reflects her earlier desire to become a mother, circa season 4, as well as her desire that Booth be the father of the baby.

In the Season 8 episode "The Shot in the Dark", Brennan is shot while working in the lab late at night.  While undergoing emergency surgery, she experiences a vision of meeting with her deceased mother, Christine Brennan.  Initially dismissing this as a hallucination, Brennan experiences several more visions throughout the episode. During these discussions, it's revealed that Brennan's hyper rationalization originates from the very last piece of advice her mother gave to her (before going on the run) which was to use her brain instead of her heart.  While that advice enabled Brennan to survive all these years, the vision of her mother explains, it's now time for Brennan to do more than just survive.

Since entering a relationship with and marrying Booth and then having children, the character has undergone development personally and is shown to be a caring wife and protective mother. She would often put aside her own atheistic views and uses her hyper-rationality to justify Booth's religious beliefs, as shown in season 8 where she references the Bible in order to persuade Booth to forgive his mother&lt;ref name="party"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Party in the Pants|episodelink=Bones (season 8)#ep164|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=April 15, 2013|season=8|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the season finale where she agrees to a church wedding, rationalizing that she could appreciate the "beauty" of the ceremony and its significance to Booth.&lt;ref name="siege"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Secret in the Siege|episodelink=Bones (season 8)#ep166|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=April 29, 2013|season=8|number=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
Brennan has had a number of relatively short relationships, including an ill-fated date with a man who turned out to be a murderer&lt;ref name="Headless Witch"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Headless Witch in the Woods | series = Bones (TV series) | network = Fox| air-date = 2006-11-26|season= 2|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the re-kindling of a romance with her former thesis supervisor.  She has stated that although she does not always feel the need for a committed emotional relationship, she has engaged in casual relationships to "satisfy biological urges".&lt;ref name = "Girl in the Fridge"&gt;{{Cite episode | title = The Girl in the Fridge|series= Bones (TV series)| network = Fox | air-date= 2005-11-29|season= 1| number = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one episode, she was spending time with two men, one for his intelligence and the other for his sexual skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.buddytv.com/articles/bones/bones-episode-42-the-man-in-th-22676.aspx | title = Bones: Episode 4.2 "The Man in the Outhouse" Recap |format= web article|work=BuddyTV | access-date = 2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Season 5, episode "The Plain in the Prodigy", she tells Booth she lost her virginity at the age of 22 and when asked why she waited so long, she said it was because the decision was "important to her". FBI psychologist Lance Sweets postulates in a number of episodes that Brennan's apprehension over having relationships is largely due in part to the abandonment and abuse she experienced as a teenager after her parents disappeared. It is said that she "hides" herself behind a front of hyper-rationalism and she always keeps people at arms' length, except for those closest to her (namely FBI partner Seeley Booth and best friend Angela Montenegro). After much character growth, Temperance Brennan is now married to her principal love interest of the series Seeley Booth, and they have a daughter (Season 7) and a son together.

===Seeley Booth===
FBI Special Agent [[Seeley Booth]] is Brennan's husband and partner, and the principal liaison between the Jeffersonian and law enforcement agencies. Prior to their marriage, he is also Brennan's principal love interest throughout the series. Although his working style initially clashed with Brennan's,&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; they have since become full-fledged partners.  Their compatibility has become one of the central points of the show, with many new characters mistaking them for a couple and co-workers, especially Angela, constantly speculating that they were "more than partners".&lt;ref name = "Man in the Morgue" /&gt; Booth and Brennan have repeatedly risked their safety to save each other, including when Booth took a bullet meant for Brennan.&lt;ref name="Wannabe"/&gt;  After Booth rescues Brennan from the corrupt Agent Kenton, Booth lifts her off the hook she was hung on by putting her tied hands around his neck even though he himself was severely injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Two Bodies in the Lab|episodelink=Two Bodies in the Lab|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=March 15, 2006|season=1|number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Two Bodies in the Lab]]", in season 1, and in "The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle", in season 5, Brennan and Booth's mutual love for [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s [[Hot Blooded]] is mentioned; Booth even refers to it as 'their song' in "The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle". Brennan once commented to Dr. Gordon Wyatt (Stephen Fry) that she "[couldn't] think of anything [she] wouldn't do to help Booth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = The Dwarf in the Dirt|series= Bones (TV series)|network = Fox|airdate= |season=5 |number=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brennan's novels are also dedicated to him and the character Special Agent Andy Lister is based on him even though she still denies it.

Initially Brennan was mostly dismissive of Booth due to their opposing worldviews and work styles – which is a source of friction and banter between them. Although she refused to admit it at first, Brennan enjoyed working with him from the beginning, even after their falling out when Booth got her drunk and "fired" her, and, in Season 1, she cajoled him into launching an investigation after finding three bone fragments on a golf course so he could work with the Jeffersonian team on the case despite the fact that the FBI technically had no jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="The Man on the Fairway"/&gt; She often unknowingly offends him on a number of occasions during the first few seasons with her tactlessness, only realizing after being gently admonished by Angela or another member of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Man in the Bear|episodelink=The Man in the Bear|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=November 1, 2005|season=1|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Man in the Fallout Shelter|episodelink=The Man in the Fallout Shelter|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=December 13, 2005|season=1|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Proof in the Pudding|episodelink=Bones (season 5)#ep96|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=January 21, 2010|season=5|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She comes to admire his ability to connect with people and read behavioral cues when interrogating suspects after coming to terms with her own lack of social skills. After finding out about his abusive childhood and haunted past in the Army, she also begins to respect him as a person. Booth, who is particularly taciturn in revealing emotions or speaking about his past, begins to open up to and confide in her. Since entering a relationship with (and eventually marrying) Booth, she is shown to be extremely supportive of him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The High in the Low|episodelink=Bones (season 9)#ep186|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=April 7, 2014|season=9|number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Male in the Mail|episodelink=Bones (season 7)#ep133|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=December 1, 2011|season=7|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= The Cold in the Case|episodelink=Bones (season 9)#ep187|series=Bones|serieslink= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate=April 14, 2014|season=9|number=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; even at the expense of her friendship with Angela.&lt;ref name="mystery"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Mystery in the Meat|episodelink=Bones (season 9)#ep176|series=Bones|serieslink=Bones (TV series)|network=Fox|date=November 22, 2013|season=9|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she put aside her own misgivings several times for Booth's benefit; for example, she agrees to have Christine christened into the Catholic church and referenced the Bible when trying to talk Booth into forgiving his mother.

Brennan acquired the nickname "Bones" from Booth. She initially disliked it but comes to regard it with affection. Booth and his son Parker are the only characters in the show she permits to use it and the former rarely addresses her by her first name or "Tempe".

In Season 2 Brennan shot and killed a person for the first time while working on a string of murders connected to serial killer Howard Epps. She was forced to pull the trigger after Epps' accomplice attacked and injured Booth with a pipe. At the end of the episode she confides in Booth of her conflicted feelings and finds comfort in the fact that Booth understood how she felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= The Blonde in the Game|episodelink=Bones (season 2)#ep26|series=Bones|serieslink= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate=September 20, 2006|season=4|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Brennan and Booth has often become strained when either partner has a significant other. For example, Booth was quite irritable when Brennan dated Agent Sully,&lt;ref name="Girl in the Gator"/&gt; and their relationship was also strained when Booth's brother Jared was showing an interest in Brennan. Brennan constantly needled Booth while he was dating Tessa.

When Brennan decided that she wanted to have a baby, she asked Booth if he would be the sperm donor. He agrees to Brennan's request at first, but subsequently struggles with the thought of not being involved in the life of his prospective child. Eventually he tells Brennan he cannot let her have his child if he is not allowed to be a father to it. Soon thereafter, it is discovered that he has a (benign) brain tumour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Critic in the Cabernet|series = Bones (TV series) |network= Fox|airdate= |season = 4 | number = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has to undergo surgery, and though the surgery is successful, a poor reaction to anesthesia left him in a coma for several days. While in his coma, Brennan reads to him from her new novel, and he has an elaborate dream in which Brennan is his wife and that she is pregnant, and that the staff at the Jeffersonian play the characters in the novel. When he awakens, he initially suffers from amnesia, not recognizing Brennan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The End in the Beginning |series= Bones (TV series) | network = Fox| airdate = |season = 4 | number = 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Harbingers in the Fountain| series = Bones (TV series) | network = Fox|airdate= | season =5 |number=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although for the majority of the series Booth and Brennan denied that their relationship was anything more than friendly professionalism, they admitted to Dr. Sweets that they kissed and nearly spent the night together after their very first case together. After this discussion, Booth attempted to convince Brennan to give a relationship a try. However, she declined, telling him that she, unlike him, is not a gambler, and isn't able to take that kind of a chance.&lt;ref name="Parts in the Sum" /&gt; They have subsequently attempted to date other people,&lt;ref name="Predator in the Pool"&gt;{{Cite episode | title = The Predator in the Pool| series = Bones (TV series) | network = Fox | airdate = | season = 5 | number = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the fact that Booth once comments that he regards Brennan as his "standard" for other women suggests that he, at least, has not completely moved on. Brennan does admit to her best friend Angela Montenegro that as time has gone on, she is unsure if she wants to keep doing consulting work for the FBI, citing that she is tired of murderers and victims, and is constantly worried that something will happen to Booth and she will be unable to save him. In the climax of Season Five, Brennan and Booth part ways for a year – he goes to [[Afghanistan]] while she leaves for the [[Maluku Islands]] in [[Indonesia]] – but they promise to meet, one year from that day, at the Lincoln Memorial.&lt;ref name="Beginning in the End"/&gt;

In the beginning of season six (7 months later), they reunite in the stated place. Booth came back from Afghanistan, along with everyone else from various places, to help save Cam's job. They all decided to stay. Booth has a serious new girlfriend, Hannah, and despite the hints of her colleagues at Brennan's unconscious jealousy of their relationship, she vehemently denies feeling uncomfortable with the new situation. Through subsequent episodes her jealousy and resentfulness began becoming more apparent as Hannah and Booth started becoming more serious. In the episode "The Doctor in the Photo", Brennan realizes she is in love with Booth and confronts him, but she is let down when Booth says that he loves Hannah and she is not a "consolation prize", prompting Brennan to conclude that she has missed her chance, later reflecting that she should move on. In episode 10 of the sixth season "The Body in the Bag", Booth tells his girlfriend about the incident, stating that it (his love for Temperance) was all in the past and whatever he felt, he does not feel it anymore, except for Hannah. However it was clear in the following episode that he still has feelings for Brennan.

Despite her apparent resolve to move on, Brennan later showed sorrow when her father noted that he always thought she and Booth would end up together. During a subsequent case involving a [[polygamist]] who would spend the night with his first wife on the night he was scheduled to sleep alone, Booth commented that, while you can love several people, there is only ever one person you love the most, prompting Brennan to ask what happens when you push that person away, something Booth answered saying that it never truly leaves, adding further weight to the implication that he still has feelings for Brennan. Following Hannah's departure, the two have begun to reconnect, to the point that, during a case that saw the two trapped in an elevator during a blackout for several hours, Booth and Brennan admitted that they are each interested in a relationship, but require more time to sort out their own feelings before they make such a commitment.

In episode 22 of season 6, "The Hole in the Heart", which saw the death of Vincent Nigel-Murray (Brennan's favorite intern) at the hands of renegade sniper Jacob Broadsky, Booth has Brennan stay at his apartment for her safety.  Later that night, Brennan, still overcome with shock and grief over Vincent's death, goes into Booth's bedroom and they talk about the events of that day, and then allows Booth to hold her in bed. It is implied in the following day that they had sex.  In the last scene of the season 6 finale, "The Change in the Game", after the birth of Angela and Hodgins' son, Brennan tells Booth that she is pregnant and that he is the father.

At the start of Season 7, a very pregnant Brennan and Booth are a couple but are going back and forth between apartments. Booth suggests that they should have their own place, whereas Brennan wants Booth to move into her apartment. It causes a minor rift between them, but is resolved when Booth admits why he wants to move into a new house and Brennan having some time to think over it says it's a good idea because she'd need him practically, emotionally and sexually. In episode 6, "The Crack in the Code," they decide to buy a two-story house in the suburbs—which they jokingly called "The Mighty Hut"—that Booth found at a police auction and renovate it, (according to a mailed check sent to Brennan in "The Heiress in the Hill", in [[Bones (season 9)|season 9]], the "Mighty Hut"'s address is "1297 Janus Street, Washington DC, 20002").  In episode 7, "The Prisoner in the Pipe", Brennan goes into labor inside a prison just as she discovers who killed in an inmate there and Booth rushes her out with the intention to take her to the nearest hospital, but they both know she won't make it in time. This leads them to driving to an inn close to the prison. At first, they are rejected and are told to leave, but after some desperate pleading from an agonized Brennan, the two of them are led to a stall where she gives birth to their daughter, [[List of Bones characters#Christine Angela Booth|Christine Angela Booth]] (named after Temperance's mother, Christine Brennan, and Temperance's best friend [[Angela Montenegro]]). Some time after the delivery, Temperance and Seeley both go back to their home where they celebrate with their friends from the Jeffersonian, who brought dinners that would last a few nights as well as a few baby supplies. In "The Past in the Present", Brennan becomes the prime suspect in the murder of her schizophrenic friend, Ethan Sawyer, after supposedly threatening to kill Christine. Max advises Brennan to get off the grid and go into hiding, but she and Booth do not follow up at this suggestion. However, at the end of the episode, after Christine is [[Infant baptism|christened]] in a Catholic church, it is revealed Brennan decided to take her father's advice and flee with her daughter until her name is cleared. Just before Brennan flees town with Christine, she tells Booth she loves him and not just because of their daughter. After she is cleared of Sawyer's murder, Brennan, Booth and Christine resume their family life.

At the end of Season 8, Brennan finally decides to marry Booth. However, their plans are ruined when a vengeful Christopher Pelant blackmails Booth, threatening to kill five random people if Booth marries Brennan. Booth calls off the wedding, but does not explain the real reason to Brennan.  Brennan is devastated but pretends to be fine with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzalez|first=Sandra|title='Bones' season finale shocker: Boss says Booth 'will make this right'|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/04/30/bones-season-8-finale-post-mortem/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time Inc]]|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title='Bones' Finale: Pelant Returns And Leaves A Devastated Brennan In His Wake (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/30/bones-finale-pelant-booth-brennan-video_n_3183598.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the season 9 premiere, Brennan fears that since Booth turned down her proposal, she fears that the love from their life is fading. After talking with bartender Aldo Clemens, a former priest and Army chaplain Booth confessed to, she realizes that it was uncharacteristic for Booth to suddenly cancel the wedding as he believed in marriage and that he likely had a legitimate reason to do so. Despite her colleagues' anger at Booth, she decides to stay with him, telling him that she understands that he has his reasons and has faith that he will resolve the issue. In the episode 4, "The Sense in the Sacrifice", after Booth singlehandedly tracks Pelant down through an abandoned building and kills him with a single gunshot, he reveals to her that Pelant had blackmailed him. Pelant had threatened to kill five innocent people if Booth continued with the wedding or went to the police or FBI. At the end of the episode he proposes and she happily accepts; unknown to them, Caroline, Angela and Hodgins witnessed it via the security cameras. In "The Woman in White", Booth and Brennan marry at a small garden ceremony outside the Jeffersonian.

Their infant son Hank Jr. (named after Booth's grandfather) was born off-screen sometime after season 10 and before the beginning of season 11.

===Tim "Sully" Sullivan===
Brennan had a brief relationship with FBI Agent Tim Sullivan ([[Eddie McClintock]]), also known as Sully, whom she met while on a case when Booth was in therapy due to his grief-induced rage over his self-perceived role in the death of serial killer Howard Epps. Sully asked Dr. Brennan out on a date after their case was completed, and they began a relationship.&lt;ref name="Girl in the Gator"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Girl in the Gator|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= 2007-02-07 |season= 2| number= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Their relationship ended, however, when Sully decided to sail a boat down to the Caribbean, and Brennan declined to leave the Jeffersonian to go with him despite Angela trying to persuade her to follow him;&lt;ref name="Bride in the River"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Boneless Bride in the River|series= Bones (TV series)|network= Fox|airdate= 2007-03-21|season= 2|number= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychiatrist Doctor Gordon Wyatt ([[Stephen Fry]]) speculated that this was due to Brennan being unable to live a life without purpose.
Despite Dr. Wyatt's original perception as to why she stayed, there exist strong indications, especially through Angela's observations of the situation, that the real reason she stayed was because of Booth. Sully returns in Season 12.

{{Tengrianism}}
'''Tengrism''', also known as '''Tengriism''', '''Tenggerism''', or '''Tengrianism''',&lt;!-- Do not put non-English translations on the English Wikipedia page --&gt; is a [[Central Asia]]n [[Central Asia#Religions|religion]] characterized by [[shamanism]], [[animism]], [[totemism]], [[polytheism|poly-]], and [[monotheism]],&lt;ref&gt;The spelling ''Tengrism'' is found in the 1960s, e.g. Bergounioux (ed.), ''Primitive and prehistoric religions'', Volume 140, Hawthorn Books, 1966, p. 80. ''Tengrianism'' is a reflection of the Russian term, {{lang|ru|Тенгрианство}}. It is reported in 1996 ("so-called Tengrianism") in Shnirelʹman (ed.), ''Who gets the past?: competition for ancestors among non-Russian intellectuals in Russia'', Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5221-3}}, [{{Google books |plainurl= yes |id=4iwHp8asmsdEC |page=31 }} p. 31] in the context of the nationalist rivalry over [[Bulgars#Legacy|Bulgar legacy]]. The spellings ''Tengriism'' and ''Tengrianity'' are later, reported (deprecatingly, in scare quotes) in 2004 in ''Central Asiatic journal'', vol. 48–49 (2004), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=GeRVAAAAYAAJ |page= 238}} p. 238].  The Turkish term {{lang|tr|Tengricilik}} is also found from the 1990s. Mongolian {{lang|mn|Тэнгэр шүтлэг}} is used in a 1999 biography of [[Genghis Khan]] (Boldbaatar et. al, {{lang|mn|Чингис хаан, 1162-1227}},  {{lang|mn| Хаадын сан}}, 1999, [{{Google books |plainurl= yes |id=OMIMAQAAMAAJ |page=18 }} p. 18]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.

In ''[[Irk Bitig]]'', Tengri is mentioned as ''Türük Tängrisi'' (God of Turks).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Roux, Die alttürkische Mythologie, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Tengrism has been advocated in intellectual circles of the [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries#Current independent states|Turkic nations]] of Central Asia (including [[Tatarstan]], [[Buryatia]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Kazakhstan]]) since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Robert A. and Vlad Strukov |title= Historical Dictionary of the Russian Federation |year= 2010 |publisher= Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn= 978-0-81085475-8 |pages=412–13 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id= l_uAoNJiOMwC}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still practiced, it is undergoing an organized revival in [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]], [[Khakas people|Khakassia]], [[Tuvans|Tuva]] and other Turkic nations in [[Siberia]]. [[Burkhanism]], a movement similar to Tengrism, is concentrated in [[Altai Republic|Altay]].

''Khukh tengri'' means "blue sky" in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Mongols|Mongolians]] still pray to ''Munkh Khukh Tengri'' ("Eternal Blue Sky") and Mongolia is sometimes poetically called the "Land of Eternal Blue Sky" (''Munkh Khukh Tengriin Oron'') by its inhabitants. In modern [[Turkey]], Tengrism is known as the ''Göktanrı dini'' ("Sky God religion");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id= CORMAAAAMAAJ }} |title=Eski Türk dini (gök tanrı inancı) ve Alevîlik-Bektaşilik |author=Mehmet Eröz | date=2010-03-10 |accessdate= 2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Turkish "Gök" (sky) and "Tanrı" (God) correspond to the Mongolian ''khukh'' (blue) and ''Tengri'' (sky), respectively. According to Hungarian archaeological research, the religion of the [[Hungarians]] until the end of the 10th century (before [[Christianity]]) was Tengrism.&lt;ref name= 'Fodor 2006'&gt;Fodor István, [http://silver.drk.hu/MVT/letolt/vt6.pdf A magyarok ősi vallásáról (About the old religion of the Hungarians)] Vallástudományi Tanulmányok. 6/2004, Budapest, p. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with shamanism==
The word "Tengrism" is a fairly new term. It is conventionally used to describe a form of Tengri-centered shamanism that prevailed on the Eurasian steppes mostly among early Turkic and Mongol Khanates. Tengrism differs from Siberian shamanism in that the polities practicing it were not small bands of hunter gatherers like the [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberians]] but a continuous succession of pastoral, semi-sedentarized Khanates and empires from the Xiongnu Empire (founded 209 BC) till the Mongol Empire (13th century). Among Turkic peoples it was radically supplanted by Islam while in Mongolia it survives as a synthesis with Tibetan Buddhism while surviving in purer forms around [[Lake Khovsgol]] and [[Lake Baikal]]. Unlike Siberian shamanism which has no written tradition, Tengrism can be identified from Turkic and Mongolic historical texts like the [[Orkhon inscriptions]], [[Secret History of the Mongols]] and [[Altan Tobchi]]. However, these texts are more historically oriented and are not strictly religious texts like the scriptures and sutras of sedentary civilizations which have elaborate doctrines and religious stories. On a scale of complexity Tengrism lies somewhere between the Proto-Indo-European religion (a pre-state form of pastoral shamanism on the western steppe) and its later form the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]]. The eastern steppe where Tengrism developed had more centralized, hierarchical polities than the western steppe. Tengrism has been noted as more centralized, less polytheistic, less myth-intensive and more historically focused than the paganism that grew out of the western Proto-Indo-European religion. Nonetheless, the chief god Tengri (Heaven) is considered strikingly similar to the Indo-European sky god [[Dyeus|*Dyeus]] and the structure of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion is closer to that of the early Turks than to the religion of any people of Near Eastern or Mediterranean antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], John C. Holt, ''Patterns in comparative religion'', 1958, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kurşun dökme (Dropping lead onto one's head).png|thumb|alt=Three photos of something being ladled into a bowl over a covered person|''Kurşun dökme'' in Turkey]]

Tengrists view their existence as sustained by the eternal blue sky ([[Tengri]]), the fertile mother-earth spirit ([[Eje (goddess)|Eje]]) and a ruler regarded as the holy spirit of the sky. Heaven, earth, spirits of nature and ancestors provide for every need and protect all humans. By living an upright, respectful life, a human will keep his world in balance and perfect his personal [[Wind Horse]], or spirit. The Huns of the northern Caucasus reportedly believed in two gods: Tangri Han (or Tengri Khan), considered identical to the Persian [[Esfandiyār|Aspandiat]] and for whom horses were sacrificed, and Kuar (whose victims are struck by lightning).&lt;ref name="Hungarians &amp; Europe"&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=I-RTt0Q6AcYC |page= 151}} |title=Hungarians &amp; Europe in the Early Middle Ages: An Introduction to Early... - András Róna-Tas |publisher= |date= |accessdate= 2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tengrism is practised in [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]], [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]], [[Tuva]] and [[Mongolia]] in parallel with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Burkhanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Balkanlar'dan Uluğ Türkistan'a Türk halk inançları Cilt 1, Yaşar Kalafat, Berikan, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kyrgyz'' means "we are forty" in the [[Kyrgyz language]], and [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s [[Flag of Kyrgyzstan|flag]] has 40 uniformly-spaced rays. Tengrist [[Khazars]] aided [[Heraclius]] by reportedly sending 40,000 soldiers during a joint [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628|Byzantine-Göktürk operation]] against the [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]].

Several Kyrgyz politicians are advocating Tengrism to fill a perceived ideological void. [[Dastan Sarygulov]], secretary of state and former chair of the Kyrgyz state gold-mining company, established the {{Interlanguage link multi|Tengir Ordo|tr}} (Army of Tengri): a civic group promoting the values and traditions of Tengrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDermott |first=Roger |url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=31177 |title=The Jamestown Foundation: High-Ranking Kyrgyz Official Proposes New National Ideology |publisher=Jamestown.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarygulov also heads a Tengrist society in [[Bishkek]] claiming nearly 500,000 followers and an international scientific center of Tengrist studies.

Articles on Tengrism have been published in social-scientific journals in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. [[Kazakhstan]] President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] and former Kyrgyz president [[Askar Akayev]] have called Tengrism the national, "natural" religion of the Turkic peoples.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Tengrism was brought to Eastern Europe by the [[Bulgars]].&lt;ref&gt;Bulgars and the Slavs followed ancestral religious practices and worshipped the sky-god Tengri. {{Google books |id=JmFetR5Wqd8C |page=79 |title=Bulgaria, Patriarchal Orthodox Church of -- }}&lt;/ref&gt; It lost importance when the [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uighuric kagans]] proclaimed [[Manichaeism]] the state religion in the eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist studies review, Volumes 6-8, 1989, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tengrism also played a large role in the religion of the Gok-Turk and [[Mongol Empire]]s. ''Gok-Turk'' translates as "celestial Turk". Genghis Khan and several generations of his followers were Tengrian believers until his fifth-generation descendant, Uzbeg Khan, turned to Islam in the 14th century.

The original Mongol khans, followers of Tengri, were known for their tolerance of other religions.&lt;ref name="Turan"&gt;Osman Turan, ''The Ideal of World Domination among the Medieval Turks'', in Studia Islamica, No. 4 (1955), pp. 77-90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Möngke Khan]], the fourth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, said: "We believe that there is only one God, by whom we live and by whom we die, and for whom we have an upright heart. But as God gives us the different fingers of the hand, so he gives to men diverse ways to approach him." ("Account of the Mongols. Diary of William Rubruck", religious debate in court documented by [[William of Rubruck]] on May 31, 1254).

==Three-world cosmology==
As in most ancient beliefs, there is a "celestial world" and an "underground world" in Tengrism. The only connection between these realms is the "[[World tree|Tree of Worlds]]" that is in the center of the worlds.

The celestial and the subterranean world are divided into seven layers (the underworld sometimes nine layers and the celestial world 17 layers). Shamans can recognize entries to travel into these realms. In the multiples of these realms, there are beings, living just like humans on the earth. They also have their own respected souls and shamans and [[nature spirit]]s. Sometimes these beings visit the earth, but are invisible to people. They manifest themselves only in a strange sizzling fire or a bark to the shaman.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.tripod.com/Mongolian_Page/shaman.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Türk Mitolojisi'', Murat Uraz, 1992 {{ISBN|9759792359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subterranean world (underworld)===
{{Main|Tamag}}
There are many similarities between the earth and the underworld and its inhabitants resemble humans, but have only two souls instead of three. They lack the "Ami soul", that produces body temperature and allows breathing. Therefore, they are pale and their blood is dark. The sun and the moon of the underworld give far less light than the sun and the moon of the earth. There are also forests, rivers and settlements underground.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.tripod.com/Mongolian_Page/shaman.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erlik|Erlik Khan]] (Mongolian: Erleg Khan) one of the sons of [[Tengri]], is the ruler of the underworld. He controls the souls here, some of them waiting to be [[Reincarnation|reborn]] again. If a sick human is not dead yet, a shaman can move to the underworld to negotiate with Erlik to bring the person back to life. If he fails, the person dies.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.tripod.com/Mongolian_Page/shaman.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heavenly world ===
The celestial world has many similarities with the earth,as if there would be no humams. There is a healthy, untouched nature here, and the natives of this place have never deviated from the traditions of their ancestors. This world is much righter than the earth and is under the auspices of [[Ulgen]] another son of Tengri. Shamans can also visit this world.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.tripod.com/Mongolian_Page/shaman.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

On some days, the doors of this heavenly world are opened and the light shines through the clouds. During this moment, the prayers of the shamans are most influential. A shaman performs his imaginary journey, which takes him to the heavens, by ridig a black bird, a deer or a horse or by going into the shape into these animals. Otherwise he may scale the World-Tree or pass the [[rainbow]] to reach the heavenly world.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.tripod.com/Mongolian_Page/shaman.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

=== View of the world ===
According to the adherence of Tengrism, the world is not only a three-dimensional environment, but also a rotating circle. Everything is bound by this circle and the tire is always renewed without stopping. The three dimensions of the Earth consists of the movement of the sun, the season which are constantly moving, and the souls of all creatures that are born again after death.

== Three souls of human ==
It is believed that people and animals have many souls. Generally, each person is considered to have three souls, but the names, characteristics an numbers of the souls may be different among some of the tribes: For example, for [[ Samoyedic peoples|Samoyets]], a Mongol tribe living in the north of Siberia, believe that women consist of four and men of five souls. Since animals also have souls, humans must respect animals.

=== Soul types ===
According Paulsen and Jultkratz, who conducted research in [[North America]], [[North Asia]] and [[Central Asia]] by Paulsen and Jultkratz, explained two souls of this belief are the same to all people:
* ''Nefes'' (''Breath'' or ''[[Nafs]]'', life or bodily spirit)
* Shadow soul / Free soul

=== Soul names ===
There are many different names for human souls among the Turks and the Mongols, but their features and meanings have not been adequately researched yet.
* Among Turks: Özüt, Süne, [[Kut (mythology)|Kut]], Sür, Salkin, Tin, Körmös, Yula
* Among Mongols: Sünesün, Amin, Kut, Sülde&lt;ref&gt; ''Götter und Mythen in Zentralasien und Nordeurasien Käthe Uray-Kőhalmi'', Jean-Paul Roux, Pertev N. Boratav, Edith Vertes: {{ISBN|3-12-909870-4}} İçinden: Jean-Paul Roux: Die alttürkische Mythologie (Eski Türk mitolojisi)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these spirits, [[Jean Paul Roux]] draws attention to the "Özkonuk" spirit mentioned in the writings from the Buddhist periods of the Uighurs.

[[Julie Stewart]], who devoted her life to research in Mongolia described the belief in the soul in one of her articles:
* '''Amin ruhu''': Provides breathing and body temperature. It is the soul which invigorates. (The Turkish counterpart is probably ''Özüt'')
* '''Sünesün ruhu''': Outside of the body, this soul moves through water. It is also the part of soul, which reincarnates. After a human died, this part of the soul moves to the world-tree. When it is reborn, it comes out of a source and enters the new-born. (Also called ''Süne ruhu'' among Turks)
* '''Sülde ruhu''': It is the soul of the self that gives a person a personality. If the other souls leave the body, they only loss consciousness, but if this soul leaves the body, the human dies. This soul resides in nature after death and is not reborn.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Stewart - Mongolian Shamanism (İng.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Tengrist movement in Central Asia}}Central Asia==
A revival of Tengrism has played a role in Central Asian [[Pan-Turkism|Turkic nationalism]] since the 1990s. It developed in [[Tatarstan]], where the Tengrist periodical ''Bizneng-Yul'' appeared in 1997. The movement spread during the 2000s to [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Buryatia]] and [[Mongolia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The term "shamanism" was first applied by Western anthropologists as outside observers of the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols, as well as those of the neighbouring Tungusic and Samoyedic-speaking peoples. Upon observing more religious traditions across the world, some Western anthropologists began to also use the term in a very broad sense. The term was used to describe unrelated magico-religious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and even completely unrelated parts of the Americas, as they believed these practices to be similar to one another.

Since the 1990s, Russian-language literature uses {{lang|ru|Тенгрианство}} ("Tengrism" or "Tengrinity") in the general sense of Mongolian shamanism. [[Buryat people|Buryat]] scholar Irina S. Urbanaeva developed a theory of Tengrianist esoteric traditions in Central Asia after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the revival of national sentiment in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Irina S. Urbanaeva (Урбанаева И.С.),

Although Tengrism has few active adherents, its revival of a [[State religion|national religion]] reached a larger audience in intellectual circles. Presenting Islam as foreign to the Turkic peoples, adherents are found primarily among the nationalistic parties of Central Asia. Tengrism may be interpreted as a Turkic version of [[Russian neopaganism]]. A related phenomenon is the revival of [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

By 2006, a Tengrist society in [[Bishkek]], an "international scientific centre of Tengrist studies" and a civic group (Tengir Ordo, the "army of Tengri") were established by Kyrgyz businessman and politician Dastan Sarygulov. His ideology incorporated [[ethnocentrism]] and [[Pan-Turkism]], but did not receive strong support. After the [[Kyrgyzstani presidential election, 2005|Kyrgyzstani presidential elections of 2005]], Sarygulov became state secretary and set up a workgroup dealing with ideological issues.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Marat, [http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/126 Kyrgyz Government Unable to Produce New National Ideology], 22 February 2006, CACI Analyst, Central Asia-Caucasus Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArghunLetterToPhilippeLeBelExtract1289.jpg|thumb|alt=Old manuscript|Arghun Khan's 1289 letter to [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], in classical [[Mongolian script]]. The letter was given to the French king by [[Buscarel of Gisolfe]].]]
[[Arghun]] expressed the association of Tengri with imperial legitimacy and military success. The majesty (''suu'') of the khan is a divine stamp granted by Tengri to a chosen individual through which Tengri controls the world order (the presence of Tengri in the khan). In this letter, "Tengri" or "Mongke Tengri" ("Eternal Heaven") is at the top of the sentence. In the middle of the magnified section, the phrase ''Tengri-yin Kuchin'' ("Power of Tengri") forms a pause before it is followed by the phrase ''Khagan-u Suu'' ("Majesty of the Khan"):
{{quote | Under the Power of the Eternal Tengri. Under the Majesty of the Khan ([[Kublai Khan]]). Arghun Our word.  To the Ired Farans (King of France). Last year you sent your ambassadors led by Mar Bar Sawma telling Us: "if the soldiers of the Il-Khan ride in the direction of Misir (Egypt) we ourselves will ride from here and join you", which words We have approved and said (in reply) "praying to Tengri (Heaven) We will ride on the last month of winter on the year of the tiger and descend on Dimisq (Damascus) on the 15th of the first month of spring." Now, if, being true to your words, you send your soldiers at the appointed time and, worshipping Tengri, we conquer those citizens (of Damascus together), We will give you Orislim (Jerusalem). How can it be appropriate if you were to start amassing your soldiers later than the appointed time and appointment? What would be the use of regretting afterwards? Also, if, adding any additional messages, you let your ambassadors fly (to Us) on wings, sending Us luxuries, falcons, whatever precious articles and beasts there are from the land of the Franks, the Power of Tengri (''Tengri-yin Kuchin'') and the Majesty of the Khan (''Khagan-u Suu'') only knows how We will treat you favorably. With these words We have sent Muskeril (Buscarello) the Khorchi. Our writing was written while We were at Khondlon on the sixth khuuchid (6th day of the old moon) of the first month of summer on the year of the cow.&lt;ref&gt;For another translation [http://www.pony-express.net/west-east/china/expo/catalogue_text/cat32_text.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:LetterArghunToNicholasIV1290VaticanArchives.jpg|thumb|alt=Another old manuscript|1290 letter from Arghun to Pope Nicholas IV]]
Arghun expressed Tengrism's non-dogmatic side. The name ''Mongke Tengri'' ("Eternal Tengri") is at the top of the sentence in this letter to [[Pope Nicholas IV]], in accordance with Mongolian Tengriist writing rules). The words "Tngri" (Tengri) and "zrlg" (zarlig, decree/order) are still written with vowel-less archaism:
{{quote| ... Your saying "May [the Ilkhan] receive ''silam'' (baptism)" is legitimate. We say: "We the descendants of Genghis Khan, keeping our own proper Mongol identity, whether some receive silam or some don't, that is only for Eternal Tengri (Heaven) to know (decide)." People who have received ''silam'' and who, like you, have a truly honest heart and are pure, do not act against the religion and orders of the Eternal Tengri and of Misiqa (Messiah or Christ). Regarding the other peoples, those who, forgetting the Eternal Tengri and disobeying him, are lying and stealing, are there not many of them? Now, you say that we have not received silam, you are offended and harbor thoughts of discontent. [But] if one prays to Eternal Tengri and carries righteous thoughts, it is as much as if he had received silam. We have written our letter in the year of the tiger, the fifth of the new moon of the first summer month (May 14th, 1290), when we were in Urumi.&lt;ref&gt;Translation on page 18 [http://globalmiddleages.org/sites/default/files/pdf-files/atwood.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 17th century Mongolian chronicle [[Altan Tobchi]] (''Golden Summary'') contains references to Tengri.

This is similar to the fusion of Buddhism and Shinto in Japan. The Altan Tobchi contains the following prayer at its very end:

==Tengrism in the Secret History of the Mongols==
[[File:Burkhan Khaldun mount2.jpg|thumb|alt=Burkhan Khaldun|[[Burkhan Khaldun|Mount Burkhan Khaldun]] is a place where Genghis Khan regularly prayed to Tengri.]]
Tengri is mentioned many times in the Secret History of the Mongols written in 1240. The book starts by listing the ancestors of Genghis Khan starting from Borte Chino (Blue Wolf) born with "destiny from Tengri". Bodonchar Munkhag the 9th generation ancestor of Genghis Khan is called a "son of Tengri". When Temujin was brought to the Qongirat tribe at 9 years old to choose a wife, Dei Setsen of the [[Qongirat]] tells Yesugei the father of Temujin (Genghis Khan) that he dreamt of a white falcon, grasping the sun and the moon, come and sit on his hands. He identifies the sun and the moon with Yesugei and Temujin. Temujin then encounters Tengri in the mountains at the age of 12. The [[Taichiud]] had come for him when he was living with his siblings and mother in the wilderness, subsisting on roots, wild fruits, sparrows and fish. He was hiding in the thick forest of Terguun Heights. After three days hiding he decided to leave and was leading his horse on foot when he looked back and noticed his saddle had fallen. Temujin says "I can understand the belly strap can come loose, but how can the breast strap also come loose? Is Tengri persuading me?" He waited three more nights and decided to go out again but a tent-sized rock had blocked the way out. Again he said "Is Tengri persuading me?", returned and waited three more nights. Finally he lost patience after 9 days of hunger and went around the rock, cutting down the wood on the other side with his arrow-whittling knife, but as he came out the Taichiud were waiting for him there and promptly captured him. [[Toghrul]] later credits the defeat of the Merkits with Jamukha and Temujin to the "mercy of mighty Tengri" (paragraph 113). Khorchi of the Baarin tells Temujin of a vision given by "Zaarin Tengri" where a bull raises dust and asks for one of his horns back after charging the ger cart of Jamukha (Temujin's rival) while another ox harnessed itself to a big ger cart on the main road and followed Temujin, bellowing "Heaven and Earth have agreed to make Temujin the Lord of the nation and I am now carrying the nation to you". Temujin afterward tells his earliest companions Boorchi and Zelme that they will be appointed to the highest posts because they first followed him when he was "mercifully looked upon by Tengri" (paragraph 125). In the Battle of Khuiten, Buyuruk Khan and Quduga try using zad stones to cause a thunderstorm against Temujin but it backfires and they get stuck in slippery mud. They say "the wrath of Tengri is upon us" and flee in disorder (paragraph 143). Temujin prays to "father Tengri" on a high hill with his belt around his neck after defeating the Taichiud at Tsait Tsagaan Tal and taking 100 horses and 50 breastplates. He says "I haven't become Lord thanks to my own bravery, but I have defeated my enemies thanks to the love of my father mighty Tengri". When Nilqa Sengum the son of Toghrul Khan tries to convince him to attack Temujin, Toghrul says "How can I think evil of my son Temujin? If we think evil of him when he is such a critical support to us, Tengri will not be pleased with us". After Nilqa Sengum throws a number of tantrums Toghrul finally relents and says "I was afraid of Tengri and said how can I harm my son. If you are really capable, then you decide what you need to do".&lt;ref&gt;http://altaica.ru/SECRET/cleaves_shI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

When Boorchi and Ogedei return wounded from the battle against Toghrul, Genghis Khan strikes his chest in anguish and says "May Eternal Tengri decide" (paragraph 172). Genghis Khan tells Altan and Khuchar "All of you refused to become Khan, that is why I led you as Khan. If you would have become Khan I would have charged first in battle and brought you the best women and horses if high Khukh Tengri showed us favor and defeated our enemies". After defeating the Keraits Genghis Khan says "By the blessing of Eternal Tengri I have brought low the Kerait nation and ascended the high throne" (paragraph 187). Genghis sends [[Subutai]] with an iron cart to pursue the sons of Togtoa and tells him "If you act exposed though hidden, near though far and maintain loyalty then Supreme Tengri will bless you and support you" (paragraph 199). Jamukha tells Temujin "I had no trustworthy friends, no talented brothers and my wife was a talker with great words. That is why I have lost to you Temujin, blessed and destined by Father Tengri." Genghis Khan appoints [[Shikhikhutug]] chief judge of the Empire in 1206 and tells him "Be my eyes to see and ears to hear when I am ordering the empire through the blessing of Eternal Tengri" (paragraph 203). Genghis Khan appoints [[Muqali]] "Gui Wang" because he "transmitted the word of Tengri when I was sitting under the spreading tree in the valley of Khorkhunag Jubur where Hotula Khan used to dance" (paragraph 206). He gives Khorchi of the Baarin 30 wives because he promised Khorchi he would fulfill his request for 30 wives "if what you say comes true through the mercy and power of Tengri" (paragraph 207). Genghis mentions both Eternal Tengri and "heaven and earth" when he says "By the mercy of Eternal Tengri and the blessing of heaven and earth I have greatly increased in power, united all the great nation and brought them under my reins" (paragraph 224). Genghis orders Dorbei the Fierce of the [[Dorbet]] tribe to "strictly govern your soldiers, pray to Eternal Tengri and try to conquer the Khori Tumed people" (paragraph 240). After being insulted by Asha Khambu of the Tanguts of being a weak Khan Genghis Khan says "If Eternal Tengri blesses me and I firmly pull my golden reins, then things will become clear at that time" (paragraph 256). When Asha Khambu of the Tangut insults him again after his return from the Khwarezmian campaign Genghis Khan says "How can we go back (to Mongolia) when he says such proud words? Though I die I won't let these words slip. Eternal Tengri, you decide" (paragraph 265). After Genghis Khan "ascends to Tengri" (paragraph 268) during his successful campaign against the Tangut (Xi Xia) the wheels of the returning funeral cart gets stuck in the ground and Gilugdei Baatar of the [[Sunud]] says "My horse-mounted divine lord born with destiny from Khukh Tengri, have you abandoned your great nation?" [[Batu Khan]] sends a secret letter to [[Ogedei Khan]] saying "Under the power of the Eternal Tengri, under the Majesty of my uncle the Khan, we set up a great tent to feast after we had broken the city of Meged, conquered the Orosuud (Russians), brought in eleven nations from all directions and pulled on our golden reins to hold one last meeting before going our separate directions" (paragraph 275).&lt;ref&gt;http://altaica.ru/SECRET/cleaves_shI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tohil''' ({{IPA|/toˈχil/}}) (also spelled '''Tojil''') was a [[deity]] of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]] period of [[Mesoamerica]].

At the time of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Conquest]], Tohil was the patron god of the K'iche'.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; Tohil's principal function was that of a [[Fire worship|fire deity]] and he was also both a [[Solar deity|sun god]] and the god of rain.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.79.n.152. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.718. Orellana 1981, p.160.&lt;/ref&gt; Tohil was also associated with mountains and he was a god of [[Maya warfare|war]], [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] and sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.358. Carmack 2001b, p.124. Sachse &amp; Christenson 2005, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the K'iche' epic [[Popul Vuh]], after the first people were created, they gathered at the [[Maya mythology|mythical]] [[Tollan]], the Place of the Seven Caves, to receive their [[K'iche' language|language]] and their [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]]. The K'iche', and others, there received Tohil.&lt;ref&gt;Read &amp; González 2000, p.90.&lt;/ref&gt; Tohil demanded blood sacrifice from the K'iche' and so they [[bloodletting in Mesoamerica|offered their own blood]] and also that of [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] captives taken in battle. In the Popul Vuh this consumption of blood by Tohil is likened to the [[suckling]] of an infant by its mother.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tohil may originally have been the same god as [[Q'uq'umatz]], and shared the attributes of the [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|feathered serpent]] with that deity,&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1987, 2008, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; but they later diverged and each deity came to have a separate priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Orellana 1981, p.159.&lt;/ref&gt; Sculptures of a human face emerging between the jaws of a serpent were common from the end of the Classic Period through to the Late Postclassic and may represent Q'uq'umatz in the act of carrying [[Maya Hero Twins|Hunahpu]], the youthful avatar of the sun god Tohil, across the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1987, 2008, pp.60, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The god's association with [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]] meant that Tohil was one of the first deities that the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] clergy tried to eradicate after the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquest of Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Orellana 1981, p.173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==
There is disagreement over the meaning of the name of the deity. It has been interpreted as meaning "[[obsidian]]",&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; as deriving from the word ''toh'' ("rain")&lt;ref&gt;Recinos et al 1954, p.132.&lt;/ref&gt; and as meaning "tribute" or "payment".&lt;ref&gt;Sachse &amp; Christenson 2005, p.15.n.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Tohil was one of a trinity of gods worshipped by the K'iche' elite, together with [[Awilix]] and [[Jacawitz]]. The concept of a triad of deities was ancient in [[Maya religion]], dating as far back as the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]].&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.61.n.65.&lt;/ref&gt; The triad of K'iche' gods were sometimes referred to collectively as Tohil.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.228.n.646.&lt;/ref&gt; Tohil has been equated with the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] [[God K]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; The deity also possesses attributes that suggest a link with [[Mixcoatl]], a hunting god of the [[Aztec gods|Aztecs]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Akkeren 1999, p.285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tohil was the patron deity of the Kaweq lineage of the K'iche'.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.718.&lt;/ref&gt; He was associated with a sacred deerskin bundle that was said to embody him, and one of his titles was ''Qajawal Kej'' ("Our Lord Deer").&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, pp.220, 239.n.680. Sachse &amp; Christenson 2005, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The deity was associated with thunder, lightning and the sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1989, p.660.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
{{double image|right|Catherwood - Santa Cruz del Quiche - Qumarkaj - Tohil Temple.jpg|205|Utatlan3.jpg|200|Drawing of the Temple of Tohil at the former K'iche' capital of [[Q'umarkaj]], by Frederick Catherwood, published in 1841|The ruins of the Temple of Tohil as they appeared in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Kaweq lineage of the K'iche' built a temple to Tohil at their first capital Jacawitz, identified as the archaeological site of [[Chitinamit]]. Jacawitz was overlooked by a shrine to the god placed on a neighbouring peak, this shrine was known as Pa Tohil.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1989, pp.663-664.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the K'iche' built their main temple to Tohil at [[Q'umarkaj]], their new capital. They made him offerings on the day ''Toh'', one of the days of their [[Tzolk'in|20-day]] [[Maya calendar|calendar]] cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; The K'iche' performed the Great Dance of Tohil in honour of the deity in the month of ''Tz'ikin Q'ij'', prior to the [[maize]] harvest (which takes place in November).&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.220.n.620.&lt;/ref&gt; This dance took place at [[Q'umarkaj]] and involved a gathering of all the principal lineages subject to the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj]], and as is described in the K'iche' chronicle ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.260.n.775.&lt;/ref&gt; they were expected to bring tribute, slaves and sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Orellana 1981, p.160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maya priesthood|priests]] of Tohil were known as ''Aj Tohil'' and were selected from the ruling Kaweq lineage of Q'umarkaj. During their ceremonies to Tohil, the K'iche' would offer [[Resplendent quetzal|quetzal]] feathers to the god.&lt;ref&gt;Orellana 1981, pp.162-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing at the end of the 17th century, [[Francisco Ximénez]] described the tradition that upon the temple [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifices]] were tied before the representation of Tohil, where the priest would open the victim's chest and cut out his heart.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.356-357.&lt;/ref&gt; After sacrifice, the victim's body was probably hurled down the front stairway of the temple where his head would be severed to be placed on a [[Tzompantli|skull rack]] that was located in front of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.360.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalents to Tohil were worshipped by other groups closely related to the K'iche'. These included Belehe Toh of the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikels]] and Hun Toh of the [[Rabinal]],&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1998, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; this last name meaning "One Rain", a calendrical date.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos et al 1954, p.132.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaqchikel and the Rabinal did not merely think their own patrons were ''equivalent'' to Tohil, they claimed that they were the same deity under a different name.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1989, p.665.&lt;/ref&gt; The K'iche' themselves claimed in the Popul Vuh that their patron Tohil was the same as [[Quetzalcoatl]] of the [[Aztec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, pp.19, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temple of Tohil===
{{main|Q'umarkaj}}
The Temple of Tohil at Q'umarkaj was the tallest structure in the city. The rubble core of the building still stands but the stone facing has been looted. The temple was originally a pyramid with stairways on all four sides, the summit shrine faced towards the rising sun in the east. This form of radial pyramid temple was built by the Maya since the Late Preclassic with examples at many archaeological sites such as [[Tikal]], [[Copán]] and [[Chichen Itza]], among others. According to [[John Lloyd Stephens]], who visited the site in the 1830s, the temple base measured {{convert|66|ft|m}} square and it stood {{convert|33|ft|m}} high. At that time the radial stairways were more-or-less intact. The temple was originally covered in painted [[stucco]], with the decoration including the painted image of a [[jaguar]].&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, pp.268-269.n.821.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern worship==
Deerskins, the symbol of Tohil, are to this day venerated in many highland Maya communities and are used in dances.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.244.n.698.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern village of [[Santiago Atitlán]] in the [[Guatemalan highlands]], a traditional Maya priesthood performs rites to a powerful deity addressed as "''King Martin, Lord of the Three Levels, Lord of Rain, Lord of Maize, and Lord of all the Mountains''".&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.220.n.620.&lt;/ref&gt; This priest blesses deerskins prior them being worn, with head and antlers attached, during the Dance of Martin on November 11 prior to the maize harvest. King Martin is probably a [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|blend]] of Tohil and his deerskin bundle with the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Martin of Tours|St Martin of Tours]], whose feast falls on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.220.n.620.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rabinal]], Tohil was merged with [[St Paul]] while still retaining many of his characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Van Akkeren 1999, p.288.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toypurina''' (1760–1799) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hackel |first1=Steven W. |title=Sources of Rebellion: Indian Testimony and the Mission San Gabriel Uprising of 1785 |date=2003-01-01 |publisher=Ethnohistory |issn=0014-1801 |pages=643–670}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Medicine man|Medicine woman]] of the [[Tongva]] nation—a nation also known as the Gabrieliño, due to their association with the Spanish mission San Gabriel. She is famous for her opposition of the colonial rule by Spanish Missionaries in California, and for her part in the planned 1785 rebellion against the mission San Gabriel, where she recruited 6 of the 8 villages which participated in the attack.

==1785 rebellion==
The causes of the San Gabriel rebellion were complex. The rebellion originated from both the Togva people's frustration at the Spanish mission's imposition on their traditional territory, as well as their oppressive rule over the Tongva's culture, language, labor, and sexual life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castañeda |first1=Antonia I. |title=Three decades of engendering history: selected works of Antonia I. Castaneda |date=2014 |publisher=University of North Texas Press |pages=75–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the dissatisfaction and anger of the Neophytes (the Spanish term for newly Baptized Indigenous people) due to both poor treatment at the hands of the Spanish, and legal suppression of their culture and ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The tangible threat imposed by the Spanish colonies to the Tongva nation's territorial boundaries and settlements was a primary factor for growing anger among the Tongva. There was also a rapid growth in the population of new Neophytes at Mission San Gabriel, some of whom were from villages who had had previous conflicts with the Tongva. Their presence, along with the rapid increase in livestock numbers in the area which which increased pressure on the Tongva’s ability to survive off their land, created further tension and resentment of the Mission.&lt;ref name="Toypurina"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bauer |first1=William |title=Toypurina. |journal=News from Native California |date=Spring 2006 |volume= 19 |issue= 3 |pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baptized Indigenous peoples within Spanish missions experienced exploitation of labour and second-class citizenship under the Spanish. Tensions and resentment rose further, however, when in 1782, the Spanish governor ordered soldiers inside the missions to never allow baptized Indigenous people to have dances in their villages. In the fall, the season of the rebellion, the Tongva held their annual Mourning Ceremony, a culmination of a series of death rituals, and through its performance the souls of the deceased achieved release from the earth and entrance into the land of the dead. By the end of October 1785, Nicolás José—a Neophyte and key figure in the 1785 rebellion— and others at the mission seem to have concluded that the ban on dances was intolerable and that it jepordized the repose of their dead relative’s spirits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nicolás José approached Toypurina, who was widely renowned as a wise and talented Medicine person and whose brother was the head of her village—a kinship connection which was another likely reason for José coming to ask for her aid.  José reportedly gave her beads—as for Tongva people it is customary to give a gift to doctors in return for their services&lt;ref name="Toypurina"/&gt; —in exchange for her calling together a meeting of unbaptized Indigenous peoples from the area &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Toypurina agreed, and went on to contact leaders of other villages to convince them to join the revolt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the night of the attack, the men involved in the attack went to the mission armed with bows and arrows, Toypurina coming along unarmed with the intention of encouraging the men’s will to fight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, someone had betrayed the Tongva to the Mission guards, and the participants and ringleaders, Toypurina included, were captured.  Spanish officials sentenced five of the attack’s participants to twenty-five lashes, and another twelve to fifteen or twenty lashes. The punishments were carried out in public as a warning and lesson to all members of the mission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Toypurina"/&gt; Toypurina, Nicolás José and two other leaders of the rebellion, Chief Tomasajaquichi of Juvit village and a man named Alijivit, from nearby village of Jajamovit, were put on trial.

When questioned about the attack, Toypurina is famously quoted in as saying that she participated in the instigation because “[she hated] the padres and all of you, for living here on my native soil, for trespassing upon the land of my forefathers and despoiling our tribal domains. . . . I came [to the mission] to inspire the dirty cowards to fight, and not to quail at the sight of Spanish sticks that spit fire and death, nor [to] retch at the evil smell of gunsmoke—and be done with you white invaders!’ &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This quote, from Thomas Workman Temple II’s article “Toypurina the Witch and the Indian Uprising at San Gabriel” is arguably a mistranslation and embellishment of her actual testimony. According to the soldier who recorded her words, she stated simply that she ‘‘was angry with the Padres and the others of the Mission, because they had come to live and establish themselves in her land.’’ &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Spanish officials found her and the three other men on trial to be guilty of leading the attack. The three men were held at the prison (presidio) in San Diego, and Toypurina was imprisoned at the prison in San Gabriel while they awaited word of their punishment. In June 1788, nearly three years later, their sentences arrived from Mexico City: Nicolás José was banned from San Gabriel and sentenced to six years of hard labour in irons at the most distant penitentiary in the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Toypurina"/&gt; Toypurina was banished from Mission San Gabriel and sent to the most distant Spanish mission.

==Later life==

According to trial records, Toypurina was forcibly coerced into being baptized in 1787 at Mission San Gabriel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Toypurina"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ruiz, Korrol |first1=Vicki L., Virginia Sánchez |title=Latinas in the United States, set |date=2006 |publisher=Bloomington: Indiana University Press |pages=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, she was moved to Mission San Carlos Borromeo. Two years after her Baptism, she married a Spaniard and soldier named Mañuel Montero, who had been serving at el Pueblo de Los Angeles, and received a tract of land from the governor. They lived in Monterey and had 3 children together (Cesario, Juana de Dios, and Maria Clementina).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is debate between scholars over whether her marriage to this soldier was a sign of her accepting Spanish religion and ways of life, or whether the marriage was one of convenience; Toypurina seeking marriage as a way to protect herself from the often harsh conditions of Spanish missions.&lt;ref name="Toypurina"/&gt; On May 22, 1799, Toypurina died at Mission San Juan Bautista in northern Alta California at age 39.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Following the Spanish authorities’ arrest of twenty-one Gabrieliños on the night of the rebellion, four of the Indians identified by the guards as the revolt’s leaders were interrogated in early January 1786.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hackel|first=S. W.|date=2003-10-01|title=Sources of Rebellion: Indian Testimony and the Mission San Gabriel Uprising of 1785 |journal=Ethnohistory|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=643–669|doi=10.1215/00141801-50-4-643|issn=0014-1801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genealogist and descendant of some of the first Spanish partakers at the mission in Alta California, Thomas Workman Temple II, was the first scholar to study this interrogation’s testimony, and published an article in 1958, “Toypurina the Witch and the Indian Uprising at San Gabriel”. To this day, despite the book's exaggeration of events &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; it is one of the most complete accounts of the rebellion organized by Toypurina, used as a major reference in subsequent articles and books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Toypurina's popularity has stretched beyond the academic realm to Californians and Americans who now regard her as a symbol of Gabrieliño resistance to the missions, as well as a primordial figure among California Native women’s protests against Spanish colonialism.            

Her rebellion against Spanish missionaries was inspired by a matriarchal power structure in which women were at the center of a tribe’s ritual and spiritual life. After Toypurina’s death, Native American women continued to resist colonialism by forming a religious-political movement that awarded power and influence to female deities and entrusted women with maintaining the health and well-being of their own communities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898420976|title=Three decades of engendering history : selected works of Antonia I. Castaneda|last=I.,|first=Castaneda, Antonia|others=Heidenreich, Linda.|isbn=9781574415827|location=Denton|oclc=898420976}}&lt;/ref&gt; As William Bauer writes in ''Toypurina'', she “emerges from the historical record as a woman who not only confronted Spanish expansion in southern California but also charted a path for her survival and the endurance of her people.”

Well-known accounts of Toypurina’s rebellion often depict her as a treacherous witch or seductive sorceress, including Temple’s article, regarded as one of the most influential for subsequent writings on the Native woman. Nonetheless, Toypurina’s resistance against the colonial authorities through medicine and dialogue was coherent with the women’s “other means of creating counter-histories,” such as through “oral and visual traditions”. These are how subjected women under the Spanish missions succeeded in remaining within the collective memories and resist throughout generations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In “Engendering the History of Alta California, 1769-1848,” Castañeda suggests that “women themselves used witchcraft as a means of subverting the socio-sexual order sanctioned by religion and enshrined in the colonial honor code."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Using “sexualized magic to control men and subvert the male order by symbolically using their own bodies” was their way of re-asserting their power physically, in face of the overbearing colonial rule, manifested through torture, cruelty, and cultural repression and eradication.  

The ongoing portrayals of Toypurina’s revolutionary endeavor as being shrouded in dark magic and ominous mystery testify to the consistent undermining of Native women’s own resistance feats and tools, from the onset of colonial rule to the present.

== Artistic references ==
Toypurina has become somewhat of a pop icon for Native American female resistance in her region today, with many sketches and cartoons of her appearing on Google Images.  

On either side of El Monte, Toypurina is celebrated through monumental public works of art: Raul González, Ricardo Estrada, and Joséph “Nuke” Montalvo painted a 60-by-20-foot mural entitled ''Conoce Tus Raíces'' (2009) (Spanish for “Know Your Roots”) in East Los Angeles. The mural was completed on the main wall of Ramona Gardens, a public housing complex historically inhabited by Latin-American families. The radiant visage placed at the center of the work of Art, flashing a defiant stare and proud posture, is that of Toypurina. She is surrounded by the Ramona Gardens’ community’s numerous activities, such as children enjoying the recent library at the time of the mural’s creation, and the young residents’ sporting activities. One of the mural’s creators qualified Toypurina as incarnating “the ultimate strength, the woman fighter, the mother who protects her children from harm at Ramona Gardens.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tropicsofmeta.com/2014/01/23/toypurina-a-legend-etched-in-the-landscape/#_ftn1|title=Toypurina: A Legend Etched in the Landscape|date=2014-01-23|work=Tropics of Meta|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabrieliño traditionalist and Chicana artist, Judy Baca, also designed a 20-foot arch and a 100-foot plaza prayer mound named “Danzas Indígenas” (Indigenous Dances) in 1993, on a Metrolink commuter train platform in Baldwin Park. It was conceptualized as a public memorial dedicated to Toypurina, and as an artistic recreation of the nearby San Gabriel Mission’s historical archway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Baldwin Park also is known as a working class Latino suburb of Los Angeles, which speaks to the present relevance of Toypurina’s original struggle and her efforts’ universal appeal to all those who feel estranged from their cultures and lands under another civilization’s powerful influence, and seek to reconnect with and celebrate their roots. Some have hinted at the irony of the memorial’s location, a commuter train platform, which is typically associated with anonymity, unfamiliarity, transience, and separation of family, home, and work, in contrast with Native tribes’ communitarian organization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Baca described her work as seeking to “put memory back into a piece of the land.” A stone mound in her installation specifically was created as a replica of an original stone mound which Gabrieliños would have used for prayer.

Baca’s reminder of these monuments as active efforts to incorporate Toypurina’s memory in the land may be related to the ongoing legacy of Toypurina and other resistant Native women’s own protests against colonial rule through oral and visual transmissions that became absorbed in their people’s collective memory that was constantly acted upon as it was passed down from generation to generation after their disappearance. The artworks’ remoteness from the San Gabriel Mission’s original location also attest to the relevance and celebration of her fight among various communities.

On January 13, 2007, the Studio for Southern California History included Toypurina as one of the many women who made significant contributions to California history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socalstudio.org/|title=Studio for Southern California History|work=socalstudio.org|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tulsi Vivah''' is the ceremonial marriage of the [[Tulsi in Hinduism|Tulsi]] (holy basil) plant to the Hindu god [[Shaligram]] or [[Vishnu]] or to his avatar, Sri [[Krishna]]. The Tulsi wedding signifies the end of the monsoon and the beginning of the wedding season in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name = "lall"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Manohar Lall|title=Among the Hindus: A Study of Hindu Festivals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlqH4Q_gqCQC&amp;pg=PA184|year=1933|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1822-0|pages=184–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tarlo"/&gt;

The ceremonial festival is performed anytime between [[Prabodhini Ekadashi]] (the eleventh or twelfth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu month]] of [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]]) and [[Kartik Poornima]] (the full moon of the month). The day varies regionally.&lt;ref name = underhill&gt;{{cite book|author=M.M.

==Legend==
{{double image|left|Ocimum tenuiflorum2.jpg|150|Vishnu.jpg|150|Tulsi and Vishnu}}

Tulsi is venerated as a goddess in Hinduism and is sometimes considered as a wife of Vishnu, with the [[epithet]], ''“Vishnupriya”'', “the beloved of [[Vishnu]]”. The legend behind Tulsi Vivah and its rites are told in the scripture, ''[[Padma Purana]]''.&lt;ref name="Verma2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manish Verma|title=Fasts &amp; Festivals Of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4gzFFLdBoYC&amp;pg=PA58|year=2005|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|isbn=978-81-7182-076-4|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Hindu scripture]]’s, the Tulsi plant was a woman named “Vrinda” (Brinda; a synonym of Tulsi). She was married to the [[Asura]] king [[Jalandhara|Jalandhar]], who due to her piety and devotion to Vishnu, became invincible. Even [[Shiva]] could not defeat Jalandhar, so he requested Vishnu - the preserver in the Trinity - to find a solution. Vishnu disguised himself as Jalandhar and tricked Vrinda by touching her. She realized it was not her husband but vishnu. This destroyed her chastity.

With her [[chastity]] destroyed, Jalandhar lost his power and was killed by Shiva. Vrinda cursed Vishnu to become black in colour and to be separated from his wife, [[Lakshmi]]. This was later fulfilled when he was transformed into the black [[Shaligram]] stone (actually a fossil), and in his [[Rama]] avatar, was separated from his wife [[Sita]], who was kidnapped by the asura king [[Ravana]]. Vrinda then drowned herself in the ocean, and the gods (or Vishnu himself) transferred her soul to a plant, which was henceforth called Tulsi. 

As per a blessing by Vishnu to marry Vrinda in her next birth, Vishnu – in form of Shaligram - married Tulsi on Prabodhini Ekadashi. To commemorate this event, the ceremony of Tulsi Vivah is performed.&lt;ref name = "lall"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tarlo"/&gt;

Another minor legend narrates that Lakshmi slew a demon on this day and remained on earth as the Tulsi plant.&lt;ref name = underhill/&gt;

==Celebrations==

The marriage of Tulsi with Vishnu/Krishna resembles the traditional Hindu wedding.&lt;ref name = "lall"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tarlo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emma Tarlo|title=Clothing Matters: Dress and Identity in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ByoTXhXCuyAC|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=184-5|isbn=978-0-226-78976-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage ceremony is conducted at homes and at temples where a fast is observed on the Tulsi Vivah day until evening when the ceremony begins. A ''mandap'' (marriage booth) is built around the courtyard of the house where the Tulsi plant is usually planted in centre of the courtyard in a brick plaster called the ''Tulsi [[vrindavana]]''. It is believed that the soul of Vrinda resides in the plant at night and leaves in the morning.&lt;ref name = underhill/&gt; The bride Tulsi is clothed with a [[sari]] and ornaments including earrings and necklaces. A human paper face with a [[bindi (decoration)|bindi]] and nose-ring may be attached to Tulsi. The groom is a brass image or picture of Vishnu or Krishna or sometimes [[Balarama]] or more frequently the Shaligram stone - the symbol of Vishnu. The image is clothed in a [[dhoti]]. Both Vishnu and Tulsi are bathed and decorated with flowers and garlands before the wedding. The couple is linked with a cotton thread (mala) in the ceremony.&lt;ref name = "Tarlo"/&gt;

===In India===

[[File:Tulsi pooja 034.jpg|thumb|Tulsi plant worshipped as part of Tulsi Vivah celebrations.]]

At Prabhu Dham in [[Saunja, India]], the festival is collectively celebrated by whole village which makes it a significant point of attraction. Here it is celebrated as three day festival in the hindi month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]] from Ekadashi to Trayodashi. The festival is started with the vedic chanting of [[Ramcharitmanas]] or [[Ramayana]] by the villagers itself. The second day is celebrated as Sobha Yatra which is of significat importance in which the special prasad is [[Pongal]], and the third day is celebrated as Tilakotsav and Vivahotsav of Lord Vishnu and Devi Brinda. The villagers prepare 56 types of prasad known as Chapan  Bhog and distributed to all. All caste takes participation in this village accordingly. Devoties including saints and mahants all over from Bihar visit this place to celebrate this festive occasion.

In [[Maharashtra]], an important ritual in the ceremony is when the white cloth is held between the bride and the groom and the priest recites the ''Mangal Ashtaka'' [[mantra]]s. These mantras formally complete the wedding. Rice mixed with vermilion is showered by the attendees on Tulsi and Vishnu at the end of the recitation of the mantras with the word "Savadhan" (literally "be careful" implying "You are united now". The white curtain is also removed. The attendees clap signifying approval to the wedding. Vishnu is offered sandalwood-paste, men's clothing and the [[yagnopavita|sacred thread]]. The bride is offered saris, turmeric, vermilion and a wedding necklace called ''Mangal-sutra'', worn by married women. Sweets and food cooked for an actual wedding are cooked for Tulsi Vivah too. This ceremony is mostly performed by women.&lt;ref name = underhill/&gt;&lt;ref name = "lall"/&gt; The [[prasad]] of sugar-cane, coconut chips, fruits and groundnut is distributed to devotees.

The expenses of the wedding are usually borne by a daughter-less couple, who act as the parents of Tulsi in the ritual wedding. The giving away of the daughter Tulsi (''kanyadaan'') to Krishna is considered meritorious to the couple. The bridal offerings to Tulsi are given to a [[Brahmin]] priest or female ascetics after the ceremony.&lt;ref name = "Tarlo"/&gt;

In two Rama temples in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], the ceremony is more elaborate. An invitation card is sent to the groom's temple by the bride's temple. On Prabodhini Ekadashi, a ''barat'' bridal procession of ''Lalji'' - an image of Vishnu - sets off to the bride's temple. Lalji is placed in a palanquin and accompanied by singing and dancing devotees. The barat is welcomed on the outskirts of Tulsi's village and the ceremonial marriage is carried at the temple. At the bride's side, Tulsi is planted in an earthen pot for the ceremony. People desirous of children perform ''Kanyadaan'' from Tulsi's side acting as her parents. [[Bhajan]]s are sung throughout the night and in the morning the barat of Lalji returns to their village with Tulsi.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14459">'''Whare Ra''' is the name of the building which housed the [[New Zealand]] branch of the [[magic (paranormal)|magical order]] the [[Stella Matutina]].  It was designed and the construction overseen by one of New Zealand’s most famous architects, and a senior member of the Order, [[James Walter Chapman-Taylor]].

Whare Ra was one of the last surviving Temples that could trace its lineage back to the original [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].  It was the only Temple to operate in a permanent, purpose-built building.

==Early preparations==
[[Image:Cover of The Forerunner, No. 13, October 1913.jpg|thumb|Cover of The Forerunner, No. 16, October 1913.]]

The foundations for the Order in New Zealand were laid by Reginald Gardiner (1872-1959).&lt;ref name="Anon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Anon |year=2012 |title=The Lantern Volume I (A Wayfaring Man Part I) |publisher=Sub Rosa Press New Zealand |isbn=978-0-473-23184-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in New South Wales, Australia, he was the son of an Anglican vicar and brother of the Anglican vicar of St Luke's Church, [[Havelock North]], [[New Zealand]], where he finally settled in 1907.  He formed about him an artistic, cultural and spiritual group whose activities became known as the "[[Havelock Work]]", and produced a publication called “The Forerunner”.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellwood |first=Robert S. |year=1993 |title=Islands of the Dawn |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=0-8248-1487-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Havelock Work grew and in time the group became known as the Society of the Southern Cross.

In 1910, Revd. Father J. Fitzgerald travelled to New Zealand on Church business, and was introduced to the group.&lt;ref name="Zalewski"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zalewski |first=Patrick J. |year=1988 |title=Secret Inner Order Rituals of the Golden Dawn |publisher=Falcon Press |isbn=0-941404-65-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was suitably impressed, and prior to his return to Britain, promised to stay in touch and to do what he could to help.  One of the last G.H. Chiefs of the Order later recollected:

:"‘Needless to say, this visit filled the group with hope and expectation. They kept in touch with the priest after he returned to England and conducted their meetings as he instructed them’."&lt;ref name="Anon2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Anon |year=2015 |title=The Lantern Volume II (A Wayfaring Man Part II) |publisher=Sub Rosa Press New Zealand |isbn=978-0-473-33874-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In due course he wrote that if further progress were to be made, that certain people of his acquaintance would need to come out from England.&lt;ref name="von Dadelszen"&gt;{{cite book |last=von Dadelszen |first=John |date=September 9, 1983 |title=The Havelock Work 1909-39 |publisher=Te Mata Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912 Dr. [[Robert Felkin]], Chief of the Order of the Stella Matutina arrived, assisted by his appointment as Inspector of the Australasian Colleges&lt;ref name="Zalewski"/&gt; of the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] by [[William Wynn Westcott]], one of the original Chiefs of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Supreme Magus of the S.R.I.A.

==Founding of the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple No 49==
[[Image:08 Looking NW at Sth wall of Whare Ra.jpg|thumb|The South side of Whare Ra.]]
Travelling with his wife and daughter, he initiated a group of twenty-four members into the Order, twelve of whom were advanced to the "Second Order".&lt;ref name="Anon"/&gt;  A sizeable piece of land was donated, and a home for the Order constructed, which they named “Whare Ra”, or House of the Sun.  It was in the basement of this house, that the large Temple was built.

:"Whare Ra is a large 3,000 sq. ft. building with the upper floor having the same footprint as the Temple below. The reinforced concrete construction was an innovative choice at the time when there was still strong resistance to any building material other than timber. But 'Whare Ra' was to be a very different building from a domestic home and the advantages of fire resistance, low maintenance, permanence and durability appealed. Also, the monolithic quality could not be ignored and it was desirable that the Temple should be of one continuous form. The reinforced walls were six inches thick and were poured by sections at a time into boxing of around a metre in height."&lt;ref name="Siers"&gt;{{cite book |last=Siers |first=Judy |year=2007 |title=The Life and Times of James Walter Chapman-Taylor |publisher=Millwood Heritage Productions |isbn=978-0-473-11340-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their three-month stay, sufficient members had been initiated to make a beginning, and the building commissioned and sufficiently advanced to enable its Consecration.  Before leaving New Zealand to return to England, a Warrant was issued establishing the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple No. 49 of the Order of the Stella Matutina. The three Chiefs that appeared on the Warrant were Reginald Gardiner, Mason Chambers, and probably Harold Large (or possibly Thomas Chambers).&lt;ref name="Anon"/&gt;

A trust had been set up to manage the monetary affairs of the Order, with the trustees being Mason Chambers, his wife Margaret Chambers, the younger John Chambers, and Reginald Gardiner.  The trust deed stated that the group was formed:

:"For the purpose of instituting carrying on or developing such scientific, religious charitable and similar work as the trustees shall in this discretion deem expedient and also for the purpose of aiding and assisting the carrying out or developing of literary work in all its branches and crafts work and similar or analogous work of which the trustees may in their absolute discretion approve or for such one or more or all of the above purposes as the trustees may from time to time determine."&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Matthew |year=1996 |title=Havelock North, The History of a Village |publisher=Hastings District Council |isbn=0-473-03962-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John von Dadelszen, who spent most of his adult life in the Order, and who had been a Temple Warden and one of its last Chiefs, stated that the Order:

:"...used a threefold system of training, i.e. ceremonial, meditation and personal study. The ceremonial involved a series of grades, with an appropriate ritual for each grade; rather on the lines of Masonic degrees, but based on the symbolism of the Tree of Life, which is the Hebrew Qabalah. There was also a special ceremony, of a more cosmic nature, to mark the vernal and autumnal equinoxes."&lt;ref name="von Dadelszen"/&gt;

A contemporary of John von Dadelszen, and fellow Chief Archie Shaw, wrote of the role of the three Chiefs, in his 1960 address to members:

:"The three Chiefs are responsible for the conduct of the whole Order, under the guidance of the Divine Powers Who direct the Order.

:"Each Chief brings to his office his own particular talents.  Together they form an equilateral triangle - a balanced and harmonious whole, and should be regarded as equal in all respects.

:"The Chiefs should act in harmony and speak as one in all matters pertaining to the rule of the Order.  They have the responsibility of ensuring that the true traditions of the Order are preserved, no matter what changes may come about in the future.  They will consult as necessity arises, with the Council of the Order, composed of senior members, and may possibly delegate certain duties to senior members from time to time.

:"The three Wardens also form a triangle, and are responsible, as deputies of the three Chiefs, for the running of the Outer Order.  In practice they should be regarded as equal with one another in their office as Warden, notwithstanding that they may possibly be of different Grades.

:"The Chiefs will meet with the Wardens at regular intervals, and generally maintain such contact as is necessary for the smooth functioning of the whole."&lt;ref name="Anon2"/&gt;
 
==The temple prospers==
In 1916, at the invitation of the members of the New Zealand branch, and with the offer of life tenancy of “Whare Ra”, Dr Felkin and his family returned to New Zealand for good.   He issued a new constitution for the Order of the Stella Matutina in the same year, informing members that the Mother Temple of the Order was now in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=R. A. |year=1986 |title=The Golden Dawn Companion |publisher=Aquarian Press |isbn=0-85030-436-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Order, governed by three ruling Chiefs, prospered under their leadership.  By the time of the death of Dr Felkin in 1926, it had a very active membership and was well established – its membership included two Anglican Bishops, General Sir Arthur Russell, Lord Jellicoe, Governor General of New Zealand,&lt;ref name="Anon"/&gt; members of Parliament, and local dignitaries and officials.

Entrance to the Temple, by the candidate for initiation, was via a secret staircase behind a wardrobe, located in Dr Felkin's surgery.&lt;ref name="Anon"/&gt;

:“Halfway down the stairs, where the candidate was required to await further instructions, was a landing, known as “the Cave”, lined with hessian curtains on which Egyptian figures were worked in light blue. After an interval of time the candidate was met by two Temple officers dressed in robes and Egyptian headdresses, blind-folded by one of them, and then led into the Temple where the ceremony of initiation began.”&lt;ref name="Anon"/&gt;

[[Image:Dr Felkin’s Grave at Havelock North Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Felkin’s grave inscription.]]

In 1931 a devastating earthquake hit the area, and many buildings were levelled or damaged. With its fortress like construction, Whare Ra was unscathed.

:"The big earthquake of 1931 did no damage whatsoever. Except that the Black Pillar, being top-heavy fell on the paw of the black sphinx on the north side of the steps to the dais in the Temple below the house."&lt;ref name="Anon"/&gt;

Mr Gardiner replaced Dr Felkin as a Greatly Honoured Chief of the Order, and with Mrs and Miss Felkin,&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="von Dadelszen"/&gt; ruled for a further stable period of 33 years.

In its heyday during the 1930s, it has been estimated that its membership numbered some 300 men and woman, and during its 60-plus-year history that approximately 400–500 people had been initiated.&lt;ref name="Anon"/&gt;  It was during this time that the Temple distanced itself from the affairs of the Stella Matutina in Britain, and renamed itself simply the Order of Smaragdum Thallasses.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

In 1949, in the last issue of The Lantern, Mrs. Felkin stated:

:"Perhaps, before very long. someone else will take up the torch that I lay down and endeavour to carry the light a little further.  Put as briefly as I can express it, I think it is the conviction of the reality of a spiritual world, not beyond or above our ordinary, everyday world, but interwoven with it here and now."&lt;ref name="von Dadelszen"/&gt;

In the Annual Report for year ending 31 December 1959, the Order's Cancellarius reported that:

:"During the past year 18 Ceremonies were held and the number of members advanced to the higher grades will add greatly to the strength of the Order.  Four new members were admitted and we welcome them.  It may be said that four new members in one year is not many, but we must remember that the Path of Initiation is only for the few.  The Order does not actively seek members, but those who are ready are inevitably drawn to the Light".&lt;ref name="Anon2"/&gt;

In 1959 Mr Gardiner and Mrs Felkin died, followed by Miss Felkin three years later.

During the late 1960s, Frater Albertus of the Paracelsus Research Society visited Whare Ra. He reported this visit to members of the society in one of their bulletins.&lt;ref name="Albertus"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paracelsus Research Society |year=1968 |title=Alchemical Laboratory Bulletin, Paracelsus Research Society 3rd Quarter, 1968, No. 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In the heart of the north island--New Zealand has two main islands-- is an interesting spot where much activity centers about the ancient wisdom. Not only are the Maories custodians of this ancient wisdom, but the later settlers brought much with them from Europe that they know how to perpetuate. Dr. Felkin was one of them. Under the Maori name "Whare Ra" (house of the sun) the Order of the Golden Dawn has its present quarters and underground temple in a beautiful, secluded and heavily landscaped place.

:"The "chiefs" as they are called, heading Whare Ra, Messrs. von Dadelszen and Salt and Mrs. Jones, whom we met proved to be very fine people with a fervent interest in perpetuating the work of the Golden Dawn, brought to New Zealand by Dr. Felkin before the first World War."

==Decline==
However, by 1978 it was clear that Whare Ra was a spent force.  On 24 August 1978 a letter was circulated to members announcing the closure:

:"Dear Fratres and Sorores,

:This letter is addressed to all members of the Order of S.T., including members of the Second Order.

:It is with great great regret that we write to inform you that the Temple is closing and there will be no Vernal Equinox Ceremony.

:Those of you who have been present at recent Equinox Ceremonies will surely have been aware, not only of the lack of numbers, but also the lack of power, in the Temple.  Those who have read their annual reports can scarcely have failed to notice that no new members have been admitted since 1975. Indeed there have been no grade ceremonies at all for the last two years or more. ..."

Much to the regret of many esoteric historians they burnt most of the group's regalia, Temple furnishings and records.  Fortunately some things survived, including the Temple's pillars, the two sphinxes which flanked either side of the dais steps, and many copies of the rituals and lectures were  passed on and preserved.

Whare Ra is now in private hands, and has been registered as a category "I" protected building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.
