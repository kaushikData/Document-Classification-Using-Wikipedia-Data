      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5129">The '''American Association for the Promotion of Social Science''' (est.1865) was founded in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], by several high-profile academics. Officers in the first years of the society included [[William Barton Rogers|William B. Rogers]], [[Thomas Hill (clergyman)|Thomas Hill]], [[George S. Boutwell]], [[Francis Lieber]], [[Erastus Otis Haven|Erastus O. Haven]], Mary Eliot Parkman, David A. Wells, [[Emory Washburn]], [[Caroline Healey Dall]], [[Samuel Eliot]], [[Franklin Benjamin Sanborn|F. B. Sanborn]], Joseph White, George Walker, Theodore W. Dwight, and James J. Higginson.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite book |title=Constitution, address, and list of members of the American Association for the Promotion of Social Science, with the questions proposed for discussion: to which are added minutes of the transactions of the association |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1866 |publisher=Wright &amp; Potter |location=Boston |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By3zZYNsZlIC |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 the group intended "to aid the development of social science, and to guide the public mind to the best practical means of promoting the amendment of laws, the advancement of education, the prevention and repression of crime, the reformation of criminals, and the progress of public morality, the adoption of sanitary regulations, and the diffusion of sound principles on questions of economy, trade, and finance. It will give attention to pauperism, and the topics related thereto ; including the responsibility of the well-endowed and successful, the wise and educated, the honest and respectable, for the failures of others. It will aim to bring together the various societies and individuals now interested in these objects, for the purpose of obtaining by discussion the real elements of truth; by which doubts are removed, conflicting opinions harmonized, and a common ground afforded for treating wisely the great social problems of the day."&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt;

The society divided itself into departments of inquiry (education; health; jurisprudence; economy, trade and finance) and laid out research questions to guide collection of the most pertinent "data required." The questions proposed for research reflected key issues of the time in American society: national debt and a national currency; taxation and revenue; labor and capital; hasty and excessive legislation; crime and punishment; the province of law in regard to education, public  health, and social morals; education of neglected and vicious children; relative value of classical and scientific instruction in schools and colleges; fine arts in education and industry; half-time system of instruction; quarantine considered in its relation to cholera; the tenement house; inspection of food and drugs; pork as an article of food; sewerage of great cities; and management of hospitals and insane asylums."&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt;

Meetings took place in Boston at the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] (Oct. 1865) and the [[Lowell Institute]] (Dec. 1865);&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt; and in New York at the YMCA on 5th Ave. (Nov. 1867).&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Nov. 20, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 the group joined with the "Boston Social Science Association" to form a joint committee called the "[[American Social Science Association]]" (ASSA);&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt; the committee met in Boston's [[Old City Hall (Boston)|city hall]] to discuss school reform and other matters.  "The first annual meeting of the ASSA ... was ... held [in] 1868."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Lepawsky. The Politics of Epistemology. Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 17, No. 3, Supplement (Sep., 1964); L. L. Bernard and J. S. Bernard. Origins of American Sociology: The Social Science Movement in the United States (New York: Crowell, 1943).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arecibo Observatory''' is a [[radio telescope]] in the municipality of [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]], [[Puerto Rico]]. This [[observatory]] is operated by [[University of Central Florida]], [https://www.yangenterprises.com/ Yang Enterprises] and [[Metropolitan University (Puerto Rico)|UMET]], under cooperative agreement with the [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation (NSF)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/iconic-arecibo-radio-telescope-saved-university-consortium |title=Iconic Arecibo radio telescope saved by university consortium |work=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=22 Feb 2018 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all |access-date=March 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304172439/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/iconic-arecibo-radio-telescope-saved-university-consortium |archive-date=March 4, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucf"&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=https://today.ucf.edu/ucf-led-consortium-manage-arecibo-observatory-puerto-rico/|title=UCF-led Consortium to Manage Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico|publisher=[[UCF Today]]|date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The observatory is the sole facility of the '''National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center''' ('''NAIC'''), which is the formal name of the observatory&lt;!-- ", and the staff that operates it" -seems strange-observatory covers it --&gt;.&lt;ref name="2010RFP"/&gt; From its construction in the 1960s until 2011, the observatory was managed by [[Cornell University]].

For more than 50 years, the observatory's {{convert|1000|ft|0|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us}} [[radio telescope]] was the world's largest single-aperture telescope, from its completion in 1963 until July 2016 when the [[Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope]] (FAST) in China was completed. It is used in three major areas of research: [[radio astronomy]], [[atmospheric science]], and [[radar astronomy]]. Scientists who want to use the observatory submit proposals that are evaluated by an independent scientific board.

The observatory has appeared in film, gaming and television productions, gaining more recognition in 1999 when it began to collect data for the [[SETI@home]] project. It has been listed on the American [[National Register of Historic Places]] starting in 2008.&lt;ref name="newlistings20081003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpreg"&gt;{{cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center / Arecibo Observatory |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/weekly_features/IonosphereCenter.pdf |format=PDF |date=March 20, 2007 |author=Juan Llanes Santos |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=October 21, 2009}} (72 pages, with many historic b&amp;w photos and 18 color photos)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the featured listing in the [[National Park Service]]'s weekly list of October 3, 2008.&lt;ref name="featured"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/nrlist.htm |title=Weekly List Actions |accessdate=October 21, 2009 |publisher=National Park Service| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091202223221/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/nrlist.htm| archivedate= December 2, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:NAIC/Arecibo_Radiotelescope,_1963 |title=Milestones:NAIC/Arecibo Radiotelescope, 1963 |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=[[IEEE]] |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a visitor center that is open part-time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naic.edu/general/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=162:vc-description&amp;catid=107&amp;Itemid=638 Visitor Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106095641/http://www.naic.edu/general/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=162%3Avc-description&amp;catid=107&amp;Itemid=638 |date=January 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2017, high winds associated with [[Hurricane Maria]] caused the 430&amp;nbsp;MHz line feed to break and fall onto the primary dish, damaging about 30 out of 38,000 aluminum panels.

== General information ==
The main collecting dish is {{convert|305|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in diameter, constructed inside the depression left by a [[karst]] [[sinkhole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Jan03/NAIC.director.deb.html| title=Astrophysicist Robert Brown, leader in telescope development, named to head NAIC and its main facility, Arecibo Observatory| author=David Brand| publisher=[[Cornell University]]| date=21 January 2003| accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dish surface is made of 38,778 perforated aluminum panels, each about {{convert|3|by|6|ft|m|0}}, supported by a mesh of steel cables. The ground beneath is accessible and supports shade-tolerant vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Views of the Arecibo Observatory|url=http://www.naic.edu/public/about/photos/hires/ao010.jpg|work=Image Gallery|publisher=Arecibo Observatory|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory has four [[radar]] transmitters, with [[EIRP|effective isotropic radiated powers]] of 20&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Terawatt|TW]] (continuous) at 2380&amp;nbsp;MHz, 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Terawatt|TW]] (pulse peak) at 430&amp;nbsp;MHz, 300&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] at 47&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 6&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] at 8&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The reflector is a [[spherical reflector]], not a [[parabolic reflector]]. To aim the device, the receiver is moved to intercept signals reflected from different directions by the spherical dish surface of {{convert|870|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Genesis of the 1000-foot Arecibo dish|journal=Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage|volume=12|issue=2|pages=141|author=Cohen, M. H.|bibcode=2009JAHH...12..141C|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parabolic mirror would have varying [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]] when the receiver is off the focal point, but the [[spherical aberration|error of a spherical mirror]] is uniform in every direction.

The receiver is on a 900-ton platform suspended {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} above the dish by 18 cables running from three [[reinforced concrete]] towers, one {{convert|365|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} high and the other two {{convert|265|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} high, placing their tops at the same elevation. The platform has a rotating, bow-shaped track {{convert|93|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} long, called the [[azimuth]] arm, carrying the receiving antennas and secondary and tertiary reflectors. This allows the telescope to observe any region of the sky in a forty-degree cone of visibility about the local [[zenith]] (between −1 and 38 degrees of [[declination]]). [[Puerto Rico]]'s location near the Northern [[Tropic of Cancer|Tropic]] allows Arecibo to view the planets in the Solar System over the Northern half of their orbit. The round trip light time to objects beyond [[Saturn]] is longer than the 2.6 hour time that the telescope can track a celestial position, preventing [[radar]] observations of more distant objects.

The origins of the observatory trace to late 1950s efforts to develop [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) defences as part of the newly formed [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|ARPA's]] ABM umbrella-effort, Project Defender. Even at this early stage it was clear that the use of [[chaff (countermeasure)|radar decoys]] would be a serious problem at the long ranges needed to successfully attack a warhead, ranges on the order of {{convert|1000|mile|km}}.&lt;ref name=darpa&gt;Barry Rosenberg, [http://www.darpa.mil/Docs/Missile_Defense_200807180930582.pdf "DARPA Paves the Way for U.S. Efforts in Ballistic Missile Defense"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010418/http://www.darpa.mil/Docs/Missile_Defense_200807180930582.pdf |date=March 5, 2016 }}, 50 Years of Bridging the Gap, DARPA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=press&gt;[http://www.alternatewars.com/WW3/WW3_Documents/DARPA/DARPA_II_PRESS.htm "Defender Anti-Ballistic Missile"], DARPA Technical Accomplishments Volume II: A Historical Review Of Selected DARPA Projects, April 1991, Section I: PRESS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many Defender projects were several studies based on the concept that a re-entering [[nuclear warhead]] would cause unique physical signatures while still in the upper atmosphere. It was known that hot, high-speed objects caused ionization of the atmosphere that reflects [[radar]] waves, and it appeared that a warhead's signature would be different enough from decoys that a detector could pick out the warhead directly, or alternately, provide added information that would allow operators to focus a conventional tracking radar on the single return from the warhead.&lt;ref name=darpa/&gt;&lt;ref name=press/&gt;

Although the concept appeared to offer a solution to the tracking problem, there was almost no information on either the physics of re-entry or a strong understanding of the normal composition of the upper layers of the [[ionosphere]]. ARPA began to address both simultaneously. To better understand the radar returns from a warhead, several radars were built on [[Kwajalein Atoll]], while Arecibo started with the dual purpose of understanding the ionosphere's F-layer while also producing a general-purpose scientific radio observatory.&lt;ref name=darpa/&gt;&lt;ref name=press/&gt;

The observatory was built between mid-1960 and November 1963. [[William E. Gordon]] of [[Cornell University]] oversaw its design, who intended to use it to study the Earth's [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name="Gold 119"&gt;{{Citation

This design would have limited its use in other research areas, such as [[radar astronomy]], [[radio astronomy]] and atmospheric science, which require the ability to point at different positions in the sky and track those positions for an extended time as Earth rotates. Ward Low of the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) pointed out this flaw and put Gordon in touch with the [[Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories|Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory]] (AFCRL) in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where one group headed by Phil Blacksmith was working on spherical reflectors and another group was studying the propagation of [[radio wave]]s in and through the upper atmosphere. Cornell University proposed the project to ARPA in mid-1958 and a contract was signed between the AFCRL and the University in November 1959. Cornell University and Zachary Sears published a request for proposals (RFP) asking for a design to support a feed moving along a spherical surface {{convert|435|ft|m|0}} above the stationary reflector. The RFP suggested a tripod or a tower in the center to support the feed. On the day the project for the design and construction of the antenna was announced at Cornell University, Gordon had also envisioned a {{convert|435|ft|m|abbr=on}} tower centered in the {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} reflector to support the feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[George Doundoulakis]], who directed research at General Bronze Corporation in Garden City, New York, along with Zachary Sears, who directed Internal Design at Digital B &amp; E Corporation, New York, received the RFP from [[Cornell University]] for the antenna design and studied the idea of suspending the [[antenna feed|feed]] with his brother, [[Helias Doundoulakis]], a [[civil engineer]]. [[George Doundoulakis]] identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, (the most important area of the reflector), and devised a better design by suspending the [[antenna feed|feed]].&lt;ref name="Frè 276"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gold 119"/&gt; He presented his proposal to [[Cornell University]] for a doughnut or [[torus]]-type [[truss]] suspended by four cables from four towers above the reflector, having along its edge a rail track for the [[azimuth]]al [[truss]] positioning. This second [[truss]], in the form of an arc, or [[arch]], was to be suspended below, which would rotate on the rails through 360 degrees. The arc also had rails on which the unit supporting the feed would move for the feed's elevational positioning. A [[counterweight]] would move symmetrically opposite to the feed for stability and, if a hurricane struck, the whole feed could be raised and lowered. [[Helias Doundoulakis]] designed the [[Wire rope|cable]] suspension system which was finally adopted. Although the present configuration is substantially the same as the original drawings by George and [[Helias Doundoulakis]], (although with three towers, instead of the original four as drawn in the original patent), the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent office]] granted [[Helias Doundoulakis]] a patent,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference| number = 3273156| y = 1966| m = 09| d = 13| inventor = Helias Doundoulakis| title = Radio Telescope having a scanning feed supported by a cable suspension over a stationary reflector}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the brothers' innovative idea. Two other assignees on the patent were friends [[William J. Casey]], who later became director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]], and Constantine Michalos, an attorney.

The idea of a spherical reflecting mirror with a steerable secondary has since been used in optical telescopes, in particular, the [[Hobby–Eberly Telescope]] and the [[Southern African Large Telescope]].

Construction began in mid-1960, with the official opening on November 1, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..ar136000.a |title=Arecibo Observatory |publisher=History.com |accessdate=2008-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314225635/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..ar136000.a |archivedate=March 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the primary dish is [[spherical]], its focus is along a line rather than at one point, as would be the case for a [[parabolic reflector]]. As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations. Each line feed covered a narrow [[Frequency range|frequency band]]: 2–5% of the center frequency of the band. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope's flexibility.

Since then, the telescope has been upgraded several times. Initially, when the maximum expected operating frequency was about 500&amp;nbsp;MHz, the surface consisted of half-inch galvanized wire mesh laid directly on the support cables. In 1974, a high-precision surface consisting of 40,000 individually adjustable aluminum panels replaced the old wire mesh, and the highest usable frequency rose to about 5000&amp;nbsp;MHz. A [[Gregorian telescope|Gregorian reflector system]] was installed in 1997, incorporating secondary and tertiary reflectors to focus radio waves at one point. This allowed installing a suite of receivers, covering the full 1–10&amp;nbsp;GHz range, that could be easily moved to the [[Focus (optics)|focal point]], giving Arecibo more flexibility. A metal mesh screen was also installed around the perimeter to block the ground's thermal radiation from reaching the feed antennas. Finally, a more powerful 2400&amp;nbsp;MHz transmitter was added.

Many scientific discoveries have been made with the observatory.

From January 2010 to February 2011, American astronomers Matthew Route and [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] detected bursts of radio emission from the T6.5 brown dwarf 2MASS J10475385+2124234.

It is also the coolest brown dwarf (at a temperature of ~900K) from which radio emission has been observed.

In 1974, the [[Arecibo Message]], an attempt to communicate with potential [[extraterrestrial life]], was transmitted from the radio telescope toward the globular cluster [[Messier 13]], about 25,000 light-years away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15663534&amp;BRD=1395&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=216620&amp;rfi=6 |title=Making Contact |author=Larry Klaes |work=Ithaca Times |date=30 November 2005 |accessdate=2008-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205064953/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15663534&amp;BRD=1395&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=216620&amp;rfi=6 |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1,679 [[bit]] pattern of 1s and 0s defined a 23 by 73 pixel [[bitmap]] image that included numbers, stick figures, chemical formulas and a crude image of the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.utah.edu/~cassiday/p1080/lec06.html |title=The Arecibo Message |author=Geaorge Cassiday |publisher=The University of Utah: Department of Physics |accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr4m6eA5?url=http://www.physics.utah.edu/~cassiday/p1080/lec06.html |archivedate=January 17, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SETI and METI projects ===
{{main|SETI|Active SETI}}
[[Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] (SETI)&lt;ref&gt;J. Tarter (2001). The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). ''Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics. ''Vol. 39, pp. 511–548 {{doi|10.1146/annurev.astro.39.1.511}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the search for extraterrestrial life or advanced technologies.  SETI aims to answer the question "Are we alone in the Universe?" by scanning the skies for transmissions from intelligent civilizations elsewhere in our galaxy.
In comparison, METI (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) refers to the [[Active SETI|active search]] by transmitting messages.

Arecibo is the source of data for the [[SETI@home]] and [[Astropulse]] [[distributed computing]] projects put forward by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and was used for the [[SETI Institute]]'s [[Project Phoenix (SETI)|Project Phoenix]] observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/searchforlife/seti_arecibo_prep_030414.html |title=Project Phoenix: SETI Prepares to Observe at Arecibo |author=Peter Backus |publisher=[[Space.com]] |date=14 April 2003 |accessdate=2008-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204130953/http://www.space.com/searchforlife/seti_arecibo_prep_030414.html |archivedate=December 4, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Einstein@Home]] distributed computing project has found more than 20 [[pulsar]]s in Arecibo data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://einstein.phys.uwm.edu/radiopulsar/html/BRP4_discoveries/|title=Einstein@Home new discoveries and detections of known pulsars in the BRP4 search|date=August 27, 2012|publisher=Einstein@Home|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
Terrestrial aeronomy experiments at Arecibo have included the [[NASA Coqui|Coqui 2]] experiment, supported by [[NASA]]. The telescope also has [[military intelligence]] uses, some of which include locating [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[radar]] installations by detecting their signals [[EME (communications)|bouncing]] off the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Blank "Secret history of Silicon Valley" talk&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited amateur radio operations have occurred, using ''moon bounce'' or [[Earth–Moon–Earth communication]], in which radio signals aimed at the Moon are reflected back to Earth. The first of these operations was on June 13–14, 1964, using the call KP4BPZ. A dozen or so two-way contacts were made on 144 and 432&amp;nbsp;MHz. On July 3 and July 24, 1965, KP4BPZ was again activated on 432&amp;nbsp;MHz, making approximately 30 contacts on 432&amp;nbsp;MHz during the limited time slots available. For these tests, a very wide-band instrumentation recorder captured a large segment of the receiving bandwidth, enabling later verification of other amateur station callsigns. These were not two-way contacts. From April 16–18, 2010, again, the Arecibo Amateur Radio Club KP4AO conducted moon-bounce activity using the antenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/moonbounce-for-everyone-courtesy-of-the-arecibo-radio-telescope|title=ARRL; Moonbounce for everyone|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--There's a QST article, but I can't find a good reference to it.--&gt;
On November 10, 2013, the KP4AO Arecibo Amateur Radio Club conducted a Fifty-Year Commemoration Activation, lasting 7 hours on 14.250&amp;nbsp;MHz SSB, without using the main dish antenna.

== Funding concerns ==
Since the early 1970s, the Arecibo Observatory has been supported by the NSF (National Science Foundation divisions of Astronomical Sciences and of Atmospheric Sciences) with incremental support by NASA, for operating the planetary radar.&lt;ref name="SP4218"&gt;{{cite web |last=Butrica |first=Andrew J. |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4218/sp4218.htm |title=NASA SP-4218: To See the Unseen – A History of Planetary Radar Astronomy |publisher=NASA |date=1996 |access-date=August 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101060112/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4218/sp4218.htm |archive-date=November 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2001 and 2006, NASA decreased, then eliminated, its support of the planetary radar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/arecibo_cuts_011220.html |title=NASA Trims Arecibo Budget, Says Other Organizations Should Support Asteroid Watch |access-date=2008-07-08 |author=Robert Roy Britt |date=20 December 2001 |work=Space.com |publisher=Imaginova |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205190409/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/arecibo_cuts_011220.html |archive-date=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
but restored and increased the funding in FY-2010.

A report by the NSF division of Astronomical Sciences, made public on November 3, 2006, recommended substantially decreased astronomy funding for the Arecibo Observatory, from $10.5 million in 2007 to $4.0 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blandford |first=Roger |title=From the Ground Up: Balancing the NSF Astronomy Program |publisher=National Science Foundation |date=22 October 2006 |url=https://www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/seniorreview/sr_report_mpsac_updated_12-1-06.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=July 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626170308/https://www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/seniorreview/sr_report_mpsac_updated_12-1-06.pdf| archive-date=June 26, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weiss |first=Rick Weiss |title=Radio Telescope And Its Budget Hang in the Balance |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090801654.html?hpid=moreheadlines

The report also advised that 80 percent of observing time be allocated to the surveys already in progress, reducing available time for smaller programs.

Academics and researchers responded by organizing to protect and advocate for the observatory. They established the Arecibo Science Advocacy Partnership (ASAP), to advance the scientific excellence of Arecibo Observatory research and to publicize its accomplishments in astronomy, aeronomy and planetary radar.&lt;ref name="areciboscience.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://areciboscience.org/index.html |title=Areciboscience.org |publisher=Areciboscience.org |access-date=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASAP's goals included mobilizing the existing broad base of support for Arecibo science within the fields it serves directly, the broad scientific community; provide a forum for the Arecibo research community and enhance communication within it; promote the potential of Arecibo for groundbreaking science; suggest paths that will maximize it into the foreseeable future, and showcase the broad impact and far-reaching implications of the science currently carried out with this unique instrument.&lt;ref name="areciboscience.org"/&gt;

Contributions by the government of Puerto Rico may be one way to help fill the funding gap, but remain controversial and uncertain. At [[town hall meeting]]s about the potential closure, [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Senate President [[Kenneth McClintock]] announced an initial local appropriation of $3.0 million during fiscal year 2008 to fund a major maintenance project to restore the three pillars that support the antenna platform to their original condition, pending inclusion in the next bond issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp/s=Locales&amp;n=82569 |title=Buscan frenar cierre de Radiotelescopio en Arecibo |author=Liz Arelis Cruz Maisonave |work=[[El Vocero]] |language=Spanish |access-date=September 4, 2008}}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bond authorization, with a $3.0 million appropriation, was approved by the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]] on November 14, 2007, on the first day of a special session called by [[Aníbal Acevedo Vilá]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.primerahora.com/XStatic/primerahora/template/nota.aspx?n=128502 |title=Senado aprueba emisión de bonos de $450 millones |publisher=''Primera Hora''| language=Spanish |date=November 14, 2007 |access-date=September 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208135546/http://www.primerahora.com/XStatic/primerahora/template/nota.aspx?n=128502 |archivedate=December 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Puerto Rico House of Representatives]] repeated this action on June 30, 2008. Puerto Rico's governor signed the measure into law in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gerardo |first1=E. |last2=Alvarado |first2=León |title=Gobernador firma emisión de bonos |work=[[El Nuevo Día]] |date=August 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These funds were made available during the second half of 2009.

In a letter published on September 19, 2007, [[José Enrique Serrano]], a member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] Appropriations Committee, asked the [[National Science Foundation]] to keep Arecibo operating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://serrano.house.gov/PressRelease.aspx?NewsID=1473 |title=Serrano concerned about potential Arecibo closure |last=Serrano |first=José E. |publisher=serrano.house.gov |date=September 19, 2007 |access-date=2008-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730201844/http://serrano.house.gov/PressRelease.aspx?NewsID=1473 |archive-date=July 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language similar to that of the letter of September 19 was included in the FY-2008 omnibus spending bill. In October 2007, Puerto Rico's then-[[Resident Commissioner]], [[Luis Fortuño]], along with [[Dana Rohrabacher]], filed legislation to assure the continued operation of the famed observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct07/Arecibo.bill.lg.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008133308/http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct07/Arecibo.bill.lg.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 8, 2007 |title=Congress gets bill to save Arecibo Observatory |publisher=Cornell University |date=3 October 2007 |access-date=September 4, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar bill was filed in the [[U.S. Senate]] in April 2008 by the Junior Senator from New York, [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/nationworld/orl-arecibo2508apr25,0,5117790.story |title=Clinton turns attention to observatory in Puerto Rico |author=Jeannette Rivera-lyles |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=25 April 2008 |access-date=September 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930045739/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/nationworld/orl-arecibo2508apr25%2C0%2C5117790.story |archive-date=September 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, in an open letter to researchers, the NSF clarified the status of the budget for NAIC, stating the present plan could hit the targeted budgetary revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Dear Colleague Letter: Providing Progress Update on Senior Review Recommendations |publisher=The National Science Foundation |date=September 20, 2007 |url=https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf07052 |access-date=July 9, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628044214/https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf07052 |archive-date=June 28, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; No mention of private funding was made. However, in the event that its budget target is not reached, it must be noted that the NSF is undertaking studies to mothball or demolish the observatory to return it to its natural setting.

In November 2007, [[The Planetary Society]] urged the [[U.S. Congress]] to prevent the Arecibo Observatory from closing because of insufficient funding, since its radar contributes greatly to the accuracy of predictions of [[Impact event|asteroid impact]]s on [[the Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;Arecibo participated in 90 of the 111 asteroid radar observations in 2005–2007. See [http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/PDS.asteroid.radar.history.html JPL's list of all asteroid radar observations.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Planetary Society believes that continued operation of the observatory will reduce the cost of mitigation (that is, deflection of a [[near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroid]] on collision to Earth), should that be necessary.

Also in November of that year ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the consequences of the budget cuts at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, K., [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/20/science/space/20scop.html?scp=2 "A Hazy Future for a 'Jewel' of Space Instruments."], ''New York Times'', November 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, the British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that the funding crisis, due to federal budget cuts, was still very much alive.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqui Goddard, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/2291068/Threat-to-world%27s-most-powerful-radio-telescope-means-we-may-not-hear-ET.html "Threat to world's most powerful radio telescope means we may not hear ET"], ''Daily Telegraph'', July 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SETI@home]] program is using the telescope as a primary source for ET research. The program urges people to send a letter to their political representatives in support of full federal funding of the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/arecibo_letter.php "Save Arecibo: Write to Congress"]. Retrieved July 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAIC received $3.1 million from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. This was used for basic maintenance and for a second, much smaller, antenna to be used for [[very long baseline interferometry]], new [[Klystron]] amplifiers for the [[Radar astronomy|planetary radar]] system and student training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naic.edu/science/new12m_antenna_arecibo.html |title=12-m Phase Reference Antenna |publisher=Naic.edu |date=June 28, 2010 |access-date=May 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315121910/http://www.naic.edu/science/new12m_antenna_arecibo.html |archive-date=March 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allotment was an increase of about 30 percent over the FY-2009 budget. However, the FY-2010 funding request by NSF was cut by $1.2 million (−12.5%) over the FY-2009 budget, in light of their continued plans to reduce funding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2010/toc.jsp "FY2010 Budget Request to Congress"]. Retrieved May 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 NSF budget was reduced by a further $1.6 million, −15% compared to 2010, with a further $1.0 million reduction projected by FY-2014.&lt;ref name="2011budget"&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2011/pdf/22-Facilities_fy2011.pdf "Major multi-user research facilities"] p.&amp;nbsp;35–38. Retrieved 2010 Feb. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in FY-2010, NASA restored its historical support by contributing $2.0 million per year for [[planetary science]], particularly the study of [[near-Earth object]]s, at Arecibo. NASA implemented this funding through its Near Earth Object Observations program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121006232826/http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2010/04/27/NASAsupport_to_Planetary_Radar.pdf "NASA Support to Planetary Radar"] retrieved 2011 July 7&lt;/ref&gt; NASA increased its support to $3.5 million per year in 2012.

Furthermore, in 2010 the NSF issued a call for new proposals for the management of NAIC starting in FY-2012.&lt;ref name="2010RFP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2010/nsf10562/nsf10562.pdf |title=NSF request for proposals issued in 2010 |access-date=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, 2011, the agency informed [[Cornell University]] that, as of October 1, 2011, it would no longer be the operator of the NAIC and the Arecibo Observatory. At that time, Cornell transferred its operations to [[SRI International]], along with two other managing partners, [[Universities Space Research Association]] and [[Metropolitan University (Puerto Rico)|Universidad Metropolitana de Puerto Rico]], with a number of other collaborators.&lt;ref name="sri"&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://www.sri.com/newsroom/press-releases/sri-international-selected-national-science-foundation-manage-arecibo-observ|title=SRI International to Manage Arecibo Observatory|publisher=[[SRI International]]|date=2013-07-10|accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/June11/AreciboStmt.html |title=SRI International to manage Arecibo Observatory |work=[[Cornell Chronicle]] |date=June 3, 2011 |access-date=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the award of the new cooperative agreement for NAIC management and operation, NSF also decertified NAIC as a [[Federally Funded Research and Development Center|Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC)]],&lt;ref name="2011budget"/&gt; with the stated goal of providing the NAIC with greater freedom to establish broader scientific partnerships and pursue funding opportunities for activities beyond the scope of those supported by NSF.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5652 "Management and Operation of the NAIC"] retrieved 2013 Apr 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the NSF released a "Dear Colleague Letter" reiterating its desire for a "substantially reduced funding commitment from NSF".&lt;ref name="DCL2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16005/nsf16005.jsp |title=Dear Colleague Letter: Concepts for Future Operation of the Arecibo Observatory |date=26 October 2015 |access-date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2016, the NSF released a followup to the October 2015 "Dear Colleague Letter" announcing a solicitation for future operation of the Observatory stating "The subject Solicitation will request the submission of formal proposals involving the continued operation of Arecibo Observatory under conditions of a substantially reduced funding commitment from NSF."&lt;ref name="DCL2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16144/nsf16144.jsp |title=Dear Colleague Letter: Intent to Release a Solicitation Regarding Future Continued Operations of the Arecibo Observatory |date=September 30, 2016 |access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage sustained from [[Hurricane Maria]] in September 2017 further clouded the observatory's future.  Although the damage was minimal,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; restoring all the previous capabilities required more than the observatory's already-threatened operating budget, and users feared the decision would be made to decommission it instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hurricane damage threatens Arecibo Observatory's future |first=Daniel |last=Clery |date=September 26, 2017 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.aaq0598 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/hurricane-damage-threatens-arecibo-observatory-s-future |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was announced in February 2018 that a consortium led by the [[University of Central Florida]] will allow the NSF to reduce its contribution towards Arecibo's operating costs from $8 million to $2 million from the fiscal year 2022–2023, with the shortfall made up by the consortium partners, thus securing the observatory's future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clery |first=Daniel |title=Arecibo telescope saved by university consortium |journal=Science |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6379/965 |date=March 2, 2018 |volume=359 |issue=6379 |pages=965–966 |subscription=yes|bibcode=2018Sci...359..965C |doi=10.1126/science.359.6379.965 |pmid=29496850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Due to its unique shape and concept the observatory is featured in many movies, video games and novels.
* The observatory was featured on ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' in part 12, "Encyclopedia Galactica".
* The observatory was used as a filming location in the climax of the [[James Bond]] movie ''[[GoldenEye]]'' (1995), and as a level in the accompanying [[Nintendo 64]] video game ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]''.
* The film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997), based on the [[Carl Sagan]] [[Contact (novel)|1985 novel]] of the same name, features the main character using the observatory as part of a [[SETI]] project.
* The 1998 film The Survivor features the observatory as an interplanetary gateway that the protagonist Tharkin is sent to when he is condemned to life imprisonment on Earth
* [[Fox Mulder]] went to the observatory in ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode, "[[Little Green Men (The X-Files)|Little Green Men]]".
* The observatory is featured in the film ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' (1995).

* A radio telescope based on the observatory is featured in the videogame ''[[Just Cause 2]]''.
* Although never specifically named, the first lines of the [[Arthur C. Clarke]] novel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' strongly imply that the opening scene takes place at the observatory. However, for the 1984 [[2010 (film)|film adaptation]], this scene was filmed at the [[Very Large Array]] in [[New Mexico]].
* The ''[[Battlefield 4]]'' multiplayer map, Rogue Transmission, is inspired by the observatory.
* The (2010) movie of ''[[The Losers (film)|The Losers]]'' has one scene filmed in the observatory.
* [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s novel ''[[Where Is Joe Merchant?]]'' includes a character named Desdemona who once worked at the observatory, where she began receiving telepathic messages from outer space. Buffett also wrote a song about her, called "Desdemona's Building A Rocket Ship".
* In the game [[Supertuxkart]] there is a level called Alien Signal featuring a giant telescope in a natural sinkhole inspired by the observatory.
* The image used for Joy Division's [[Unknown Pleasures]] album cover, was originally created by radio astronomer Harold Craft at the Arecibo Observatory for his 1970 PhD thesis.

[[File:Diamond-33187.jpg|thumb|Rare Brazilian ballas]]
'''Ballas''' or '''shot [[bort]]''' is a term used in the [[diamond]] industry to refer to shards of non-[[Gemstone|gem]]-grade/quality diamonds. It comprises small diamond crystals that are concentrically arranged in rough spherical stones with a fibrous texture. Ballas is hard, tough, and difficult to cleave. It is mostly found in [[Brazil]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

'''Bibliomining''' is the use of a combination of [[data mining]], [[data warehousing]], and [[bibliometrics]] for the purpose of analyzing library services. The term was created in 2003 by Scott Nicholson, Assistant Professor, Syracuse University School of Information Studies, in order to distinguish data mining in a library setting from other types of data mining.

==How bibliomining works==
First a data warehouse must be created. This is done by compiling information on the resources, such as titles and authors, subject headings, and descriptions of the collections. Then the demographic surrogate information is organized. Finally the library information (such as the librarian, whether or not the information came from the reference desk or circulation desk, and the location of the library) is obtained. 

Once this is organized, the data can be processed and analyzed. This can be done via a few methods, such as online analytical processing ([[OLAP]]), using a data mining program, or through [[data visualization]].

==Uses of bibliomining==
Bibliomining is used to discover patterns in what people are reading and researching and allows librarians to target their community better. Bibliomining can also help library directors focus their budgets on resources that will be utilized. Another use is to determine when people use the library more often, so staffing needs can be adequately met. Combining bibliomining with other research techniques such as focus groups, surveys and cost-benefit analysis, will help librarians to get a better picture of their patrons and their needs.

==Issues==

There is some concern that data mining violates patron privacy. But by extracting the data, all [[personally identifiable information]] is deleted, and the data warehouse is clean. The original patron data can then be totally deleted and there will be no way to link the new data to a particular patron.  This can be done in a few ways. One, used with information regarding database access, is to track the IP address, but then replace it with a similar code, that will allow identification without violating privacy.  Another is to keep track of an item returned to the library and create a "demographic surrogate" of the patron. The demographic surrogate would not give any identifiable information such as names, library card numbers or addresses.

The other concern in bibliomining is that it only provides data in a very detached manner. Information is given as to how a patron uses library resources, but there is no way to track if the resources met the user's needs completely. Someone could take out a book on a topic, but not find the information they were seeking. Bibliomining only helps identify which books are used, not how useful they actually were. Bibliomining cannot provide information on how well a collection serves a patron. In order to counteract this, bibliomining must be used in accordance with other research techniques.

'''''Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science''''' is a 1979 book by astrophysicist [[Carl Sagan]]. Its chapters were originally articles published between 1974 and 1979 in various magazines, including ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[Physics Today]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Scientific American]]''.  In the introduction, Sagan wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science|first=Carl|last=Sagan|origyear=1979|year=2011|publisher=[[Random House Publishing Group]]|page=xiii|isbn=9780307800992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYpP6zmD9G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22broca's%20brain%22&amp;pg=PR13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|As long as there have been human beings, we have posed the deep and fundamental questions...If we don't destroy ourselves, most of us will be around for the answers...  By far the most exciting, satisfying and exhilarating time to be alive is the time in which we pass from ignorance to knowledge on these fundamental issues.|p. xiii}}

==Title==
The title essay is named in honor of the French [[physician]], [[anatomist]] and [[anthropologist]], [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880). He is best known for his discovery that different functions are assigned to different parts of the brain. He believed that by studying the brains of cadavers and correlating the known experiences of the former owners of the organs, human behavior could eventually be discovered and understood. To that end, he saved hundreds of human brains in jars of [[formalin]]; among the collection is his own neural organ. When Sagan finds it in [[Musée de l'Homme]], he poses questions that challenge some core ideas of human existence such as "How much of that man known as Paul Broca can still be found in this jar?"—a question that evokes both [[Religion|religious]] and [[Science|scientific]] argument.

==Contents==

A major part of the book is devoted to debunking "paradoxers" who either live at the edge of science or are outright [[charlatan]]s. An example of this is the controversy surrounding [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s ideas presented in the book ''[[Worlds in Collision]]''. Another large part of the book discusses naming conventions for the members of our solar system and their physical features. Sagan also discusses [[Science fiction]] at some length. Here, he mentions [[Robert A. Heinlein]] as being one of his favorite science fiction authors in his childhood. [[Near death experience]]s and their cultural ambiguity is another topic of the essays. Sagan also criticizes ideas developed in [[Robert K. G. Temple]]'s book ''[[The Sirius Mystery]]'', published three years earlier in 1975.

In the final section of the book, "Ultimate Questions." Sagan writes:
{{quote|...My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, our curiosity and intelligence were provided by such a god...on the other hand if such a god does not exist then our curiosity and intelligence are the essential tools for survival. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is essential for the welfare of the human species.}}

'''Charles Moore Wheatley''' (16 March 1822 [[Chipping Ongar|Ongar]], [[England]] – 6 May 1882 [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]]) was a noted [[English-American]] [[miner]] and [[Paleontology|palaeontologist]] of the 19th century.  He is noted for identifying several new fossilized species, some of which bear his name, and for his connection to the [[Port Kennedy Bone Cave]], which contained one of the most important middle [[Pleistocene]] ([[Irvingtonian]], approximately 750,000 years ago) fossil deposits in North America.

He also managed successful mines in [[Connecticut]] and [[Pennsylvania]], including a [[lead]] mine in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]].

'''Cold fusion''' is a hypothesized type of [[nuclear reaction]] that would occur at, or near, [[room temperature]]. This is compared with the [[nuclear fusion|"hot" fusion]] which takes place naturally within [[Main sequence|stars]], under immense pressure and at temperatures of millions of degrees, and distinguished from [[muon-catalyzed fusion]]. There is currently no accepted theoretical model that would allow cold fusion to occur.

In 1989 [[Martin Fleischmann]] (then one of the world's leading [[electrochemistry|electrochemists]]) and [[Stanley Pons]] reported that their apparatus had produced anomalous heat ("excess heat") of a magnitude they asserted would defy explanation except in terms of nuclear processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
Nuclear fusion is normally understood to occur at temperatures in the tens of millions of degrees.  Since the 1920s, there has been speculation that nuclear fusion might be possible at much lower temperatures by catalytically fusing hydrogen absorbed in a metal catalyst. In 1989, a claim by Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann (then one of the world's leading electrochemists) that such cold fusion had been observed caused a brief media sensation before the majority of scientists criticized their claim as incorrect after many found they could not replicate the excess heat. Since the initial announcement, cold fusion research has continued by a small community of researchers who believe that such reactions happen and hope to gain wider recognition for their experimental evidence.

===Early research===
The ability of [[palladium hydride|palladium to absorb hydrogen]] was recognized as early as the nineteenth century by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]].{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=7}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the Absorption and Dialytic Separation of Gases by Colloid Septa|url = http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/156/399|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|date = 1866-01-01|issn = 0261-0523|pages = 399–439|volume = 156|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1866.0018|first = Thomas|last = Graham|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151231225845/http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/156/399|archivedate = 31 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, two Austrian born scientists, [[Friedrich Paneth]] and [[Kurt Peters (chemist)|Kurt Peters]], originally reported the transformation of hydrogen into helium by nuclear catalysis when hydrogen was absorbed by finely divided palladium at room temperature. However, the authors later retracted that report, saying that the helium they measured was due to background from the air.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=7}}{{sfn|ps=|Paneth|Peters|1926}}

In 1927 Swedish scientist John Tandberg reported that he had fused hydrogen into helium in an [[electrolytic cell]] with palladium electrodes.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=7}} On the basis of his work, he applied for a Swedish patent for "a method to produce helium and useful reaction energy".{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=7}} Due to Paneth and Peters's retraction and his inability to explain the physical process, his patent application was denied.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=7}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyteknik.se/popular_teknik/smatt_gott/article3092779.ece Kall fusion redan på 1920-talet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210020/http://www.nyteknik.se/popular_teknik/smatt_gott/article3092779.ece |date=3 March 2016 }}, Ny Teknik, Kaianders Sempler, 9 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; After [[deuterium]] was discovered in 1932, Tandberg continued his experiments with [[heavy water]].{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=7}} The final experiments made by Tandberg with heavy water were similar to the original experiment by Fleischmann and Pons.&lt;ref name="similar_to_tandberg"&gt;{{harvnb|Pool|1989}}, {{harvnb|Wilner|1989}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=19–21}} {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=13–14, 271}}, {{harvnb|Taubes|1993|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleischmann and Pons were not aware of Tandberg's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="text" name="tandberg_not_known_by_FP" /&gt;&lt;ref group="text" name="tandberg_not_known_by_FP2" /&gt;

The term "cold fusion" was used as early as 1956 in a ''New York Times'' article about [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]]'s work on [[muon-catalyzed fusion]].{{sfn|ps=|Laurence|1956}} [[Paul Palmer (physicist)|Paul Palmer]] and then [[Steven E. Jones|Steven Jones]] of [[Brigham Young University]] used the term "cold fusion" in 1986 in an investigation of "geo-fusion", the possible existence of fusion involving hydrogen isotopes in a [[planetary core]].{{sfn|ps=|Kowalski|2004|loc=II.A2}} In his original paper on this subject with Clinton Van Siclen, submitted in 1985, Jones had coined the term "piezonuclear fusion".{{sfn|ps=|Kowalski|2004|loc=II.A2}}&lt;ref&gt;C. DeW. Van Siclen and S. E. Jones, "Piezonuclear fusion in isotopic hydrogen molecules," J. Phys. G: Nucl. Phys. 12: 213–221 (March 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fleischmann–Pons experiment===
The most famous cold fusion claims were made by Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann in 1989. After a brief period of interest by the wider scientific community, their reports were called into question by nuclear physicists. Pons and Fleischmann never retracted their claims, but moved their research program to France after the controversy erupted.

====Events preceding announcement====
[[File:Cold fusion electrolysis.svg|thumb|Electrolysis cell schematic]]
[[Martin Fleischmann]] of the [[University of Southampton]] and [[Stanley Pons]] of the [[University of Utah]] hypothesized that the high compression ratio and mobility of [[deuterium]] that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}} To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy water within a calorimeter, an insulated vessel designed to measure process heat. Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the [[heavy water]] being renewed at intervals.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}} Some deuterium was thought to be accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}} For most of the time, the power input to the cell was equal to the calculated power leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30&amp;nbsp;°C. But then, at some point (in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50&amp;nbsp;°C without changes in the input power. These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The calculated power leaving the cell was significantly higher than the input power during these high temperature phases. Eventually the high temperature phases would no longer occur within a particular cell.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}}

In 1988 Fleischmann and Pons applied to the [[United States Department of Energy]] for funding towards a larger series of experiments. Up to this point they had been funding their experiments using a small device built with $100,000 [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket]].{{sfn|ps=|Crease|Samios|1989|p=V1}} The grant proposal was turned over for [[peer review]], and one of the reviewers was [[Steven E. Jones|Steven Jones]] of [[Brigham Young University]].{{sfn|ps=|Crease|Samios|1989|p=V1}} Jones had worked for some time on [[muon-catalyzed fusion]], a known method of inducing nuclear fusion without high temperatures, and had written an article on the topic entitled "Cold nuclear fusion" that had been published in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in July 1987. Fleischmann and Pons and co-workers met with Jones and co-workers on occasion in [[Utah]] to share research and techniques. During this time, Fleischmann and Pons described their experiments as generating considerable "excess energy", in the sense that it could not be explained by [[chemical reaction]]s alone.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}} They felt that such a discovery could bear significant commercial value and would be entitled to [[patent|patent protection]]. Jones, however, was measuring neutron flux, which was not of commercial interest.{{sfn|ps=|Crease|Samios|1989|p=V1}}{{clarify|date=November 2015}} To avoid future problems, the teams appeared to agree to simultaneously publish their results, though their accounts of their 6 March meeting differ.{{sfn|ps=|Lewenstein|1994|pp=8–9}}

====Announcement====
In mid-March 1989, both research teams were ready to publish their findings, and Fleischmann and Jones had agreed to meet at an airport on 24 March to send their papers to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' via [[FedEx]].{{sfn|ps=|Lewenstein|1994|pp=8–9}} Fleischmann and Pons, however, pressured by the University of Utah, which wanted to establish priority on the discovery,&lt;ref name="utah patent"/&gt; broke their apparent agreement, submitting their paper to the ''Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry'' on 11 March, and disclosing their work via a press release&lt;ref name=Utahpress1989&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|mode=cs2|last=University of Utah|title='Simple experiment' results in sustained n-fusion at room temperature for first time|url=http://newenergytimes.com/v2/reports/UniversityOfUtahPressRelease.shtml|accessdate=28 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014224924/http://newenergytimes.com/v2/reports/UniversityOfUtahPressRelease.shtml|archivedate=14 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and press conference on 23 March.{{sfn|ps=|Crease|Samios|1989|p=V1}} Jones, upset, faxed in his paper to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' after the press conference.{{sfn|ps=|Lewenstein|1994|pp=8–9}}

Fleischmann and Pons' announcement drew wide media attention.&lt;ref name=Brooks&gt;For example, in 1989, the ''Economist'' editorialized that the cold fusion "affair" was "exactly what science should be about." {{Cite book |ref=harv |mode=cs2 |first=JK|last=Footlick|title=Truth and Consequences: how colleges and universities meet public crises|isbn=978-0-89774-970-1|page=51|location=Phoenix|publisher=Oryx Press|year=1997}} as cited in {{Cite book |ref=harv |mode=cs2 |first=M|last=Brooks|title=13 Things That Don't Make Sense|isbn=978-1-60751-666-8|page=67|location=New York|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|year=2008|title-link=13 Things That Don't Make Sense }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the 1986 discovery of [[high-temperature superconductivity]] had made the scientific community more open to revelations of unexpected scientific results that could have huge economic repercussions and that could be replicated reliably even if they had not been predicted by established theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|pp=57–60}}, {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientists were also reminded of the [[Mössbauer effect]], a process involving [[Isomeric transition|nuclear transitions]] in a solid. Its discovery 30 years earlier had also been unexpected, though it was quickly replicated and explained within the existing physics framework.{{sfn|ps=|Goodstein|1994}}

The announcement of a new purported clean source of energy came at a crucial time: adults still remembered the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the problems caused by oil dependence, anthropogenic [[global warming]] was starting to become notorious, the [[anti-nuclear movement]] was labeling nuclear power plants as dangerous and getting them closed, people had in mind the consequences of [[strip mining]], [[acid rain]], the [[greenhouse effect]] and the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]], which happened the day after the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Petit|2009}}, {{harvnb|Park|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the press conference, [[Chase N. Peterson]], Fleischmann and Pons, backed by the solidity of their scientific credentials, repeatedly assured the journalists that cold fusion would solve environmental problems, and would provide a limitless inexhaustible source of clean energy, using only seawater as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=xviii–xx}}, {{harvnb|Park|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said the results had been confirmed dozens of times and they had no doubts about them.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=xx–xxi}} In the accompanying press release Fleischmann was quoted saying: "What we have done is to open the door of a new research area, our indications are that the discovery will be relatively easy to make into a usable technology for generating heat and power, but continued work is needed, first, to further understand the science and secondly, to determine its value to energy economics."&lt;ref name="Utahpress1989"/&gt;

====Response and fallout====
Although the experimental protocol had not been published, physicists in several countries attempted, and failed, to replicate the excess heat phenomenon. The first paper submitted to ''Nature'' reproducing excess heat, although it passed peer-review, was rejected because most similar experiments were negative and there were no theories that could explain a positive result;&lt;ref group="notes" name="Beaudette rejection"/&gt;{{sfn|ps=|Beaudette|2002|pp=183, 313}} this paper was later accepted for publication by the journal ''Fusion Technology''. [[Nathan Lewis (chemist)|Nathan Lewis]], professor of chemistry at the [[California Institute of Technology]], led one of the most ambitious validation efforts, trying many variations on the experiment without success,&lt;ref name="CAB"&gt;{{cite web |last=Aspaturian |first=Heidi |date=14 December 2012&lt;!-- pdf metadata, archive record page updated 2012-12-26 --&gt; |title=Interview with Charles A.

In April 1989, Fleischmann and Pons published a "preliminary note" in the ''[[Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry]]''.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}} This paper notably showed a gamma peak without its corresponding [[Compton edge]], which indicated they had made a mistake in claiming evidence of fusion byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tate|1989|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Platt|1998}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=277–288, 362–363}}, {{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=141, 147, 167–171, 243–248, 271–272, 288}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=63, 138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleischmann and Pons replied to this critique,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv |mode=cs2 |title=Measurement of gamma-rays from cold fusion (letter by Fleischmann et al. and reply by Petrasso et al.) |journal=Nature |volume=339 |issue=6227 |date=29 June 1989 |doi=10.1038/339667a0 |url=http://www.psfc.mit.edu/icf/Home%20Page/Papers/Petrasso_Nature.pdf |bibcode=1989Natur.339..667F |page=667 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720173049/http://www.psfc.mit.edu/icf/Home%20Page/Papers/Petrasso_Nature.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2013 |df= |last1=Fleischmann |first1=Martin |last2=Pons |first2=Stanley |last3=Hawkins |first3=Marvin |last4=Hoffman |first4=R.

Nevertheless, Fleischmann and Pons and a number of other researchers who found positive results remained convinced of their findings.{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}} The University of Utah asked Congress to provide $25 million to pursue the research, and Pons was scheduled to meet with representatives of President Bush in early May.{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}}

On 30 April 1989 cold fusion was declared dead by the ''New York Times''. The ''Times'' called it a circus the same day, and the ''Boston Herald'' attacked cold fusion the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|p=242}} (Boston Herald's is {{harvnb|Tate|1989}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 1989 the [[American Physical Society]] held a session on cold fusion in Baltimore, including many reports of experiments that failed to produce evidence of cold fusion. At the end of the session, eight of the nine leading speakers stated that they considered the initial Fleischmann and Pons claim dead, with the ninth, [[Johann Rafelski]], abstaining.{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}} [[Steven E. Koonin]] of [[Caltech]] called the Utah report a result of "''the incompetence and delusion of Pons and Fleischmann,''" which was met with a standing ovation.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|p=266}} [[Douglas R. O. Morrison]], a physicist representing [[CERN]], was the first to call the episode an example of [[pathological science]].{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/physics/Cold-fusion/vince-cate/aps.ascii|title=APS Special Session on Cold Fusion, May 1–2, 1989|author=|date=|website=ibiblio.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726071304/http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/physics/Cold-fusion/vince-cate/aps.ascii|archivedate=26 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May, due to all this new criticism, the meetings with various representatives from Washington were cancelled.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=267–268}}

From 8 May only the A&amp;M tritium results kept cold fusion afloat.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=275, 326}}

In July and November 1989, ''Nature'' published papers critical of cold fusion claims.{{sfn|ps=|Gai|Rugari|France|Lund|1989|pp=29–34}}{{sfn|ps=|Williams|Findlay|Craston|Sené|1989|pp=375–384}} Negative results were also published in several other [[scientific journal]]s including ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', and ''[[Physical Review|Physical Review C]]'' (nuclear physics).&lt;ref group="notes" name="nature critical papers"/&gt;

In August 1989, in spite of this trend, the state of [[Utah]] invested $4.5 million to create the National Cold Fusion Institute.{{sfn|ps=|Joyce|1990}}

The [[United States Department of Energy]] organized a special panel to review cold fusion theory and research.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=39}} The panel issued its report in November 1989, concluding that results as of that date did not present convincing evidence that useful sources of energy would result from the phenomena attributed to cold fusion.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=36}} The panel noted the large number of failures to replicate excess heat and the greater inconsistency of reports of nuclear reaction byproducts expected by established [[conjecture]]. Nuclear fusion of the type postulated would be inconsistent with current understanding and, if verified, would require established conjecture, perhaps even theory itself, to be extended in an unexpected way. The panel was against special funding for cold fusion research, but supported modest funding of "focused experiments within the general funding system."{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=37}} Cold fusion supporters continued to argue that the evidence for excess heat was strong, and in September 1990 the National Cold Fusion Institute listed 92 groups of researchers from 10 different countries that had reported corroborating evidence of excess heat, but they refused to provide any evidence of their own arguing that it could endanger their patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no further DOE nor NSF funding resulted from the panel's recommendation.{{sfn|ps=|Mallove|1991|pp=246–248}} By this point, however, academic consensus had moved decidedly toward labeling cold fusion as a kind of "pathological science".&lt;ref name="nytdoe"/&gt;{{sfn|Rousseau|1992}}

In March 1990 Michael H. Salamon, a physicist from the [[University of Utah]], and nine co-authors reported negative results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salamon|first1=M. H.|last2=Wrenn|first2=M.

In early May 1990 one of the two A&amp;M researchers, [[Kevin Wolf]], acknowledged the possibility of spiking, but said that the most likely explanation was tritium contamination in the palladium electrodes or simply contamination due to sloppy work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=410–411}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=270, 322}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=118–119, 121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1990 an article in ''Science'' by science writer [[Gary Taubes]] destroyed the public credibility of the A&amp;M tritium results when it accused its group leader [[John Bockris]] and one of his graduate students of spiking the cells with tritium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=410–411, 412, 420}}, the Science article was {{harvnb|Taubes|1990}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=122, 127–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1990 Wolf finally said that the results were explained by tritium contamination in the rods.{{sfn|ps=|Huizenga|1993|pp=122–123}} An A&amp;M cold fusion review panel found that the tritium evidence was not convincing and that, while they couldn't rule out spiking, contamination and measurements problems were more likely explanations,&lt;ref group="text" name="spiking"/&gt; and Bockris never got support from his faculty to resume his research.

On 30 June 1991 the National Cold Fusion Institute closed after it ran out of funds;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |mode=cs2 |title=National Cold Fusion Institute Records, 1988–1991 |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/UU_EAD&amp;CISOPTR=160 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717185323/http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/UU_EAD&amp;CISOPTR=160 |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it found no excess heat, and its reports of tritium production were met with indifference.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|p=424}}

On 1 January 1991 Pons left the University of Utah and went to Europe.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|p=424}}{{sfn|ps=|Huizenga|1993|p=184}} In 1992, Pons and Fleischman resumed research with [[Toyota Motor Corporation]]'s IMRA lab in France.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|p=424}} Fleischmann left for England in 1995, and the contract with Pons was not renewed in 1998 after spending $40 million with no tangible results.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=136–138}} The IMRA laboratory stopped cold fusion research in 1998 after spending £12 million.{{sfn|ps=|Voss|1999}} Pons has made no public declarations since, and only Fleischmann continued giving talks and publishing papers.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=136–138}}

Mostly in the 1990s, several books were published that were critical of cold fusion research methods and the conduct of cold fusion researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Close|1992}}, {{harvnb|Taubes|1993}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993}}, and {{harvnb|Park|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, several books have appeared that defended them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallove|1991}}, {{harvnb|Beaudette|2002}}, {{harvnb|Simon|2002}}, {{harvnb|Kozima|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1998, the University of Utah had already dropped its research after spending over $1 million, and in the summer of 1997, Japan cut off research and closed its own lab after spending $20 million.&lt;ref name="wired steam"/&gt;

===Subsequent research===
A 1991 review by a cold fusion proponent had calculated "about 600 scientists" were still conducting research.&lt;ref name="small community 600"&gt;{{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=210–211}} citing {{cite journal |ref=harv |mode=cs2  |title=Nuclear Fusion in an Atomic Lattice: An Update on the International Status of Cold Fusion Research |last=Srinivisan |first=M.|journal=Current Science |volume=60 |page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1991, cold fusion research only continued in relative obscurity, conducted by groups that had increasing difficulty securing public funding and keeping programs open. These small but committed groups of cold fusion researchers have continued to conduct experiments using Fleischmann and Pons electrolysis set-ups in spite of the rejection by the mainstream community.&lt;ref name="small community" /&gt;{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=131–133, 218}} ''The Boston Globe'' estimated in 2004 that there were only 100 to 200 researchers working in the field, most suffering damage to their reputation and career.{{sfn|ps=|Daley|2004}} Since the main controversy over Pons and Fleischmann had ended, cold fusion research has been funded by private and small governmental scientific investment funds in the United States, Italy, Japan, and India.

== Current research ==
Cold fusion research continues today in a few specific venues, but the wider scientific community has generally marginalized the research being done and researchers have had difficulty publishing in mainstream journals.{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}}&lt;ref name="most scientists" /&gt;&lt;ref name="small community" /&gt; The remaining researchers often term their field '''Low Energy Nuclear Reactions''' ('''LENR'''), '''Chemically Assisted Nuclear Reactions''' ('''CANR'''),{{sfn|ps=|Mullins|2004}} '''Lattice Assisted Nuclear Reactions''' ('''LANR'''), '''Condensed Matter Nuclear Science''' ('''CMNS''') or '''Lattice Enabled Nuclear Reactions'''; one of the reasons being to [[euphemism|avoid the negative connotations]] associated with "cold fusion".{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=131–133, 218}}{{sfn|ps=|Seife|2008|pp=154–155}} The new names avoid making bold implications, like implying that fusion is actually occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|pp=131}}, citing {{harvnb|Collins|Pinch|1993|loc=p. 77 in first edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers who continue acknowledge that the flaws in the original announcement are the main cause of the subject's marginalization, and they complain of a chronic lack of funding&lt;ref name="bbc march 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | ref=harv | mode=cs2 | title=Cold fusion debate heats up again | journal=[[BBC]] | date=23 March 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7959183.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111172930/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7959183.stm | archivedate=11 January 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and no possibilities of getting their work published in the highest impact journals.{{sfn|ps=|Feder|2004|p=27}} University researchers are often unwilling to investigate cold fusion because they would be ridiculed by their colleagues and their professional careers would be at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=292, 352, 358}}, {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}, {{harvnb|Adam|2005}} (comment attributed to George Miley of the University of Illinois)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, [[David Goodstein]], a professor of physics at [[Caltech]], advocated for increased attention from mainstream researchers and described cold fusion as:

{{blockquote|1=A pariah field, cast out by the scientific establishment. Between cold fusion and respectable science there is virtually no communication at all. Cold fusion papers are almost never published in refereed scientific journals, with the result that those works don't receive the normal critical scrutiny that science requires. On the other hand, because the Cold-Fusioners see themselves as a community under siege, there is little internal criticism. Experiments and theories tend to be accepted at face value, for fear of providing even more fuel for external critics, if anyone outside the group was bothering to listen. In these circumstances, crackpots flourish, making matters worse for those who believe that there is serious science going on here.{{sfn|ps=|Goodstein|1994}}}}

===United States===

[[File:Spawar1stGenCFCell.JPG|thumb|upright|Cold fusion apparatus at the [[Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego]] (2005)]]
United States Navy researchers at the [[Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center]] (SPAWAR) in San Diego have been studying cold fusion since 1989.{{sfn|ps=|Mullins|2004}}&lt;ref name=MosierBoss2009 /&gt; In 2002 they released a two-volume report, "Thermal and nuclear aspects of the Pd/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system," with a plea for funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/tr/1862/tr1862-vol1.pdf Szpak, Masier-Boss: Thermal and nuclear aspects of the Pd/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216190531/http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/tr/1862/tr1862-vol1.pdf |date=16 February 2013 }}, Feb 2002. Reported by {{harvnb|Mullins|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and other published papers prompted a 2004 [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) review.{{sfn|ps=|Mullins|2004}}

{{anchor|2004 DOE panel}}
In August 2003, the [[U.S. Secretary of Energy]], [[Spencer Abraham]], ordered the DOE to organize a second review of the field.{{sfn|ps=|Brumfiel|2004}} This was thanks to an April 2003 letter sent by MIT's [[Peter L. Hagelstein]],&lt;ref name="Weinberger2004"/&gt;{{rp|3}} and the publication of many new papers, including the Italian ENEA and other researchers in the 2003 International Cold Fusion Conference,&lt;ref name=ENEA_Magazin/&gt; and a two-volume book by U.S. [[SPAWAR]] in 2002.{{sfn|ps=|Mullins|2004}} Cold fusion researchers were asked to present a review document of all the evidence since the 1989 review. The report was released in 2004. The reviewers were "split approximately evenly" on whether the experiments had produced energy in the form of heat, but "most reviewers, even those who accepted the evidence for excess power production, 'stated that the effects are not repeatable, the magnitude of the effect has not increased in over a decade of work, and that many of the reported experiments were not well documented.'"{{sfn|ps=|Brumfiel|2004}}{{sfn|ps=|Feder|2005}} In summary, reviewers found that cold fusion evidence was still not convincing 15 years later, and they didn't recommend a federal research program.{{sfn|ps=|Brumfiel|2004}}{{sfn|ps=|Feder|2005}} They only recommended that agencies consider funding individual well-thought studies in specific areas where research "could be helpful in resolving some of the controversies in the field".{{sfn|ps=|Brumfiel|2004}}{{sfn|ps=|Feder|2005}} They summarized its conclusions thus:

{{quotation|While significant progress has been made in the sophistication of calorimeters since the review of this subject in 1989, the conclusions reached by the reviewers today are similar to those found in the 1989 review.

The current reviewers identified a number of basic science research areas that could be helpful in resolving some of the controversies in the field, two of which were: 1) material science aspects of deuterated metals using modern characterization techniques, and 2) the study of particles reportedly emitted from deuterated foils using state-of-the-art apparatus and methods. The reviewers believed that this field would benefit from the peer-review processes associated with proposal submission to agencies and paper submission to archival journals.|Report of the Review of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions, US Department of Energy, December 2004{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|2004}}}}

Cold fusion researchers placed a "rosier spin"{{sfn|ps=|Feder|2005}} on the report, noting that they were finally being treated like normal scientists, and that the report had increased interest in the field and caused "a huge upswing in interest in funding cold fusion research."{{sfn|ps=|Feder|2005}} However, in a 2009 BBC article on an American Chemical Society's meeting on cold fusion, particle physicist [[Frank Close]] was quoted stating that the problems that plagued the original cold fusion announcement were still happening: results from studies are still not being independently verified and inexplicable phenomena encountered are being labelled as "cold fusion" even if they are not, in order to attract the attention of journalists.&lt;ref name="bbc march 2009"/&gt;

In February 2012, millionaire [[Sidney Kimmel]], convinced that cold fusion was worth investing in by a 19 April 2009 interview with physicist [[Robert Duncan (physicist)|Robert Duncan]] on the US news-show ''[[60 Minutes]]'',&lt;ref name=Columbia_Tribune_SKINR /&gt; made a grant of $5.5 million to the [[University of Missouri]] to establish the Sidney Kimmel Institute for Nuclear Renaissance (SKINR).

===India===

In the 1990s India stopped its research in cold fusion at the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] because of the lack of consensus among mainstream scientists and the US denunciation of the research.{{sfn|ps=|Jayaraman|2008}} Yet, in 2008, the [[National Institute of Advanced Studies]] recommended that the Indian government revive this research. Projects were commenced at the [[Chennai]]'s [[Indian Institute of Technology]], the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the [[Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research]].{{sfn|ps=|Jayaraman|2008}} However, there is still skepticism among scientists and, for all practical purposes, research has stalled since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref= harv |mode= cs2 |title= Our dream is a small fusion power generator in each house |journal= Times of India |date= 4 February 2011 |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-04/interviews/28358904_1_cold-fusion-hydrogen-and-nickel-scientists |deadurl= no |archiveurl= http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110826044622/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-04/interviews/28358904_1_cold-fusion-hydrogen-and-nickel-scientists |archivedate= 26 August 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A special section in the Indian multidisciplinary journal ''[[Current Science]]'' published 33 cold fusion papers in 2015 by major cold fusion researchers including several Indian researchers.&lt;ref name="currentscience.ac.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/php/feat.php?feature=Special+Section:+Low+Energy+Nuclear+Reactions&amp;featid=10094|title=Current Science - Archive|author=|date=|website=www.currentscience.ac.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reported results==
A cold fusion experiment usually includes:
* a metal, such as [[palladium]] or [[nickel]], in bulk, thin films or powder; and
* [[deuterium]], [[hydrogen]], or both, in the form of water, gas or plasma.

Electrolysis cells can be either open cell or closed cell. In open cell systems, the electrolysis products, which are gaseous, are allowed to leave the cell. In closed cell experiments, the products are captured, for example by catalytically recombining the products in a separate part of the experimental system. These experiments generally strive for a steady state condition, with the electrolyte being replaced periodically. There are also "heat-after-death" experiments, where the evolution of heat is monitored after the electric current is turned off.

The most basic setup of a cold fusion cell consists of two electrodes submerged in a solution containing palladium and heavy water. The electrodes are then connected to a power source to transmit electricity from one electrode to the other through the solution.&lt;ref name="reignites"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when anomalous heat is reported, it can take weeks for it to begin to appear—this is known as the "loading time," the time required to saturate the palladium electrode with hydrogen (see "Loading ratio" section).

The Fleischmann and Pons early findings regarding helium, neutron radiation and tritium were never replicated satisfactorily, and its levels were too low for the claimed heat production and inconsistent with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|US DOE|1989|p=29}}, {{harvnb|Taubes|1993}}{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutron radiation has been reported in cold fusion experiments at very low levels using different kinds of detectors, but levels were too low, close to background, and found too infrequently to provide useful information about possible nuclear processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffman|1995|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excess heat and energy production===
An excess heat observation is based on an [[First law of thermodynamics|energy balance]]. Various sources of energy input and output are continuously measured. Under normal conditions, the energy input can be matched to the energy output to within experimental error. In experiments such as those run by Fleischmann and Pons, an electrolysis cell operating steadily at one temperature transitions to operating at a higher temperature with no increase in applied current.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}} If the higher temperatures were real, and not an experimental artifact, the energy balance would show an unaccounted term. In the Fleischmann and Pons experiments, the rate of inferred excess heat generation was in the range of 10–20% of total input, though this could not be reliably replicated by most researchers.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|2004|p=3}} Researcher [[Nathan Lewis (chemist)|Nathan Lewis]] discovered that the excess heat in Fleischmann and Pons's original paper was not measured, but estimated from measurements that didn't have any excess heat.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=256–259}}

Unable to produce excess heat or neutrons, and with positive experiments being plagued by errors and giving disparate results, most researchers declared that heat production was not a real effect and ceased working on the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=x, 22–40, 70–72, 75–78, 97, 222–223}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=211–214, 230–232, 254–271}}, {{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=264–266, 270–271}} {{harvnb|Choi|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, after their original report, Fleischmann reported "heat-after-death" experiments—where excess heat was measured after the electric current supplied to the electrolytic cell was turned off.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|1993}} This type of report has also become part of subsequent cold fusion claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mengoli|Bernardini|Manduchi|Zannoni|1998}}, {{harvnb|Szpak|Mosier-Boss|Miles|Fleischmann|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helium, heavy elements, and neutrons===
[[File:Triple tracks in CR-39.jpg|right|thumb|"Triple tracks" in a [[CR-39]] plastic radiation detector claimed as evidence for neutron emission from palladium deuteride]]
Known instances of nuclear reactions, aside from producing energy, also produce [[nucleon]]s and particles on readily observable ballistic trajectories. In support of their claim that nuclear reactions took place in their electrolytic cells, Fleischmann and Pons reported a [[neutron flux]] of 4,000 neutrons per second, as well as detection of tritium. The classical [[Branching fraction|branching ratio]] for previously known fusion reactions that produce tritium would predict, with 1 [[watt]] of power, the production of 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons per second, levels that would have been fatal to the researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dEJJqgw8pvwC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;vq=radiation+He-4+4,000+1012+neutrons&amp;dq=Voodoo+science&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 49]}}, {{harvnb|Park|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xzCK6-Kqs6QC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=neutron+neutrons+tritium+gamma+rays 17–18]}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=7}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=306–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Mosier-Boss et al. reported what they called the first scientific report of highly energetic neutrons, using [[CR-39]] plastic radiation detectors,&lt;ref name=MosierBoss2009&gt;{{harvnb|Mosier-Boss|Szpak|Gordon|Forsley|2009}}, {{harvnb|Sampson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the claims cannot be validated without a [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative analysis]] of neutrons.{{sfn|ps=|Barras|2009}}{{sfn|ps=|Berger|2009}}

Several medium and heavy elements like calcium, titanium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, copper and zinc have been reported as detected by several researchers, like [[Tadahiko Mizuno]] or [[George H. Miley|George Miley]]. The report presented to the [[United States Department of Energy|United States Department of Energy (DOE)]] in 2004 indicated that deuterium-loaded foils could be used to detect fusion reaction products and, although the reviewers found the evidence presented to them as inconclusive, they indicated that those experiments did not use state-of-the-art techniques.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|2004|pp=3, 4, 5}}

In response to doubts about the lack of nuclear products, cold fusion researchers have tried to capture and measure nuclear products correlated with excess heat.{{sfn|ps=|Hagelstein|2010}} Considerable attention has been given to measuring &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He production.{{sfn|ps=|Hagelstein|McKubre|Nagel|Chubb|2004}} However, the reported levels are very near to background, so contamination by trace amounts of helium normally present in the air cannot be ruled out. In the report presented to the DOE in 2004, the reviewers' opinion was divided on the evidence for &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He; with the most negative reviews concluding that although the amounts detected were above background levels, they were very close to them and therefore could be caused by contamination from air.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|2004|pp=3,4}}

One of the main criticisms of cold fusion was that deuteron-deuteron fusion into helium was expected to result in the production of [[gamma rays]]—which were not observed and were not observed in subsequent cold fusion experiments.{{sfn|ps=|Schaffer|1999|p=2}}{{sfn|ps=|Rogers|Sandquist|1990}} Cold fusion researchers have since claimed to find X-rays, helium, neutrons{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|p=215}} and [[nuclear transmutation]]s.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=150–153, 162}} Some researchers also claim to have found them using only light water and nickel cathodes.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|p=215}}  The 2004 DOE panel expressed concerns about the poor quality of the theoretical framework cold fusion proponents presented to account for the lack of gamma rays.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|2004|pp=3,4}}

==Proposed mechanisms==
Researchers in the field do not agree on a theory for cold fusion.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=153, 214–216}} One proposal considers that hydrogen and its [[Isotopes of hydrogen|isotopes]] can be absorbed in certain solids, including [[palladium hydride]], at high densities. This creates a high partial pressure, reducing the average separation of hydrogen isotopes. However, the reduction in separation is not enough by a factor of ten to create the fusion rates claimed in the original experiment.&lt;ref name="distance" /&gt; It was also proposed that a higher density of hydrogen inside the palladium and a lower potential barrier could raise the possibility of fusion at lower temperatures than expected from a simple application of [[Coulomb's law]]. [[Effective nuclear charge|Electron screening]] of the positive hydrogen nuclei by the negative electrons in the palladium lattice was suggested to the 2004 DOE commission,{{sfn|ps=|Hagelstein|McKubre|Nagel|Chubb|2004|pp=14–15}} but the panel found the theoretical explanations not convincing and inconsistent with current physics theories.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|2004}}

==Criticism==
Criticism of cold fusion claims generally take one of two forms: either pointing out the theoretical implausibility that fusion reactions have occurred in electrolysis set-ups or criticizing the excess heat measurements as being spurious, erroneous, or due to poor methodology or controls. There are a couple of reasons why known fusion reactions are an unlikely explanation for the excess heat and associated cold fusion claims.&lt;ref group="text" name="branching_and_gamma" /&gt;

===Repulsion forces===

Because nuclei are all positively charged, they strongly repel one another.{{sfn|ps=|Schaffer|1999|p=2}} Normally, in the absence of a catalyst such as a [[Muon-catalyzed fusion|muon]], very high [[Kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] are required to overcome this [[Coulomb's law|charged repulsion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Saeta|1999|loc= (pages 3–5; "Assessment"; Morrison, Douglas R.O.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapolating from known fusion rates, the rate for uncatalyzed fusion at room-temperature energy would be 50 orders of magnitude lower than needed to account for the reported excess heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|p=viii}} "''Enhancing the probability of a nuclear reaction by 50 orders of magnitude (...) via the chemical environment of a metallic lattice, contradicted the very foundation of nuclear science.''", {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}, {{harvnb|Scaramuzzi|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In muon-catalyzed fusion there are more fusions because the presence of the muon causes deuterium nuclei to be 207 times closer than in ordinary deuterium gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=32, 54}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; But deuterium nuclei inside a palladium lattice are further apart than in deuterium gas, and there should be fewer fusion reactions, not more.&lt;ref name="distance"&gt;{{harvnb|US DOE|1989|pp=7–8, 33, 53–58 (appendix 4.A)}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=257–258}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|p=112}}, {{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=253–254}} quoting [[Howard Kent Birnbaum]] in the special cold fusion session of the 1989 spring meeting of the Materials Research Society, {{harvnb|Park|2000|pp=17–18, 122}}, {{harvnb|Simon|2002|p=50}} citing {{cite journal |ref=harv |mode=cs2  |author1=Koonin S.E. |author2=M Nauenberg |year= 1989 |title= Calculated Fusion Rates in Isotopic Hydrogen Molecules |journal= Nature |issue= 6227|pages= 690–692 |doi= 10.1038/339690a0 |bibcode = 1989Natur.339..690K |volume=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paneth and Peters in the 1920s already knew that palladium can absorb up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen gas, storing it at several thousands of times the [[atmospheric pressure]].{{sfn|ps=|Close|1992|pp=19–20}} This led them to believe that they could increase the nuclear fusion rate by simply loading palladium rods with hydrogen gas.{{sfn|ps=|Close|1992|pp=19–20}} Tandberg then tried the same experiment but used electrolysis to make palladium absorb more deuterium and force the deuterium further together inside the rods, thus anticipating the main elements of Fleischmann and Pons' experiment.{{sfn|ps=|Close|1992|pp=19–20}}&lt;ref name="similar_to_tandberg" /&gt; They all hoped that pairs of hydrogen nuclei would fuse together to form helium, which at the time was needed in Germany to fill [[zeppelin]]s, but no evidence of helium or of increased fusion rate was ever found.{{sfn|ps=|Close|1992|pp=19–20}}

This was also the belief of geologist Palmer, who convinced Steven Jones that the helium-3 occurring naturally in Earth perhaps came from fusion involving hydrogen isotopes inside catalysts like nickel and palladium.{{sfn|ps=|Close|1992|pp=63–64}} This led their team in 1986 to independently make the same experimental setup as Fleischmann and Pons (a palladium cathode submerged in heavy water, absorbing deuterium via electrolysis).{{sfn|ps=|Close|1992|pp=64–66}} Fleischmann and Pons had much the same belief,{{sfn|ps=|Close|1992|pp=32–33}} but they calculated the pressure to be of 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; atmospheres, when cold fusion experiments only achieve a loading ratio of one to one, which only has between 10,000 and 20,000 atmospheres.&lt;ref group="text" name="pressure" /&gt; [[John R. Huizenga]] says they had misinterpreted the [[Nernst equation]], leading them to believe that there was enough pressure to bring deuterons so close to each other that there would be spontaneous fusions.{{sfn|ps=|Huizenga|1993|pp=33, 47}}

===Lack of expected reaction products===

Conventional deuteron fusion is a two-step process,&lt;ref group="text" name="branching_and_gamma" /&gt; in which an unstable high energy intermediary is formed:
:[[deuterium|D]] + D → [[Alpha particle|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]][[Nuclear isomer|&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]] + 24 [[MeV]]
Experiments have observed only three decay pathways for this excited-state nucleus, with the [[Branching fraction|branching ratio]] showing the probability that any given intermediate follows a particular pathway.&lt;ref group="text" name="branching_and_gamma"/&gt; The products formed via these decay pathways are:
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; → [[neutron|n]] + [[Helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]] + 3.3 MeV ([[Branching fraction|ratio]]=50%)
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; → [[proton|p]] + [[Tritium|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]] + 4.0 MeV (ratio=50%)
:[[Isomeric transition|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]] + [[gamma particle|γ]] + 24 MeV (ratio=10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;)
Only about one in one million of the intermediaries decay along the third pathway, making its products comparatively rare when compared to the other paths.{{sfn|ps=|Schaffer|1999|p=2}} This result is consistent with the predictions of the [[Bohr model]].&lt;ref group="text" name="consistent"/&gt; If one watt (1 eV = 1.602 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; joule) of nuclear power were produced from deuteron fusion consistent with known branching ratios, the resulting neutron and tritium (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H) production would be easily measured.{{sfn|ps=|Schaffer|1999|p=2}}{{sfn|ps=|Huizenga|1993|pp=7}} Some researchers reported detecting &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He but without the expected neutron or tritium production; such a result would require branching ratios strongly favouring the third pathway, with the actual rates of the first two pathways lower by at least five orders of magnitude than observations from other experiments, directly contradicting both theoretically predicted and observed branching probabilities.&lt;ref group="text" name="branching_and_gamma" /&gt; Those reports of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He production did not include detection of [[gamma ray]]s, which would require the third pathway to have been changed somehow so that gamma rays are no longer emitted.&lt;ref group="text" name="branching_and_gamma" /&gt;

The known rate of the decay process together with the inter-atomic spacing in a [[metallic crystal]] makes heat transfer of the 24 MeV excess energy into the host metal lattice prior to the [[Reaction intermediate|intermediary]]'s decay inexplicable in terms of conventional understandings of [[momentum]] and energy transfer,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scaramuzzi|2000|p=4}}, {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=207–208, 218}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even then there would be measurable levels of radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=308–309}} "Some radiation would emerge, either electrons ejected from atoms or X-rays as the atoms are disturbed, but none were seen."&lt;/ref&gt; Also, experiments indicate that the ratios of deuterium fusion remain constant at different energies.&lt;ref name="Huizenga_chemical_environment"&gt;{{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=268}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, pressure and chemical environment only cause small changes to fusion ratios.&lt;ref name="Huizenga_chemical_environment" /&gt; An early explanation invoked the [[Oppenheimer–Phillips process]] at low energies, but its magnitude was too small to explain the altered ratios.{{sfn|ps=|Huizenga|1993|pp=75–76, 113}}

===Setup of experiments===
Cold fusion setups utilize an input power source (to ostensibly provide [[activation energy]]), a [[platinum group]] [[electrode]], a deuterium or hydrogen source, a [[calorimeter]], and, at times, detectors to look for byproducts such as helium or neutrons. Critics have variously taken issue with each of these aspects and have asserted that there has not yet been a consistent reproduction of claimed cold fusion results in either energy output or byproducts. Some cold fusion researchers who claim that they can consistently measure an excess heat effect have argued that the apparent lack of reproducibility might be attributable to a lack of quality control in the electrode metal or the amount of hydrogen or deuterium loaded in the system. Critics have further taken issue with what they describe as mistakes or errors of interpretation that cold fusion researchers have made in calorimetry analyses and energy budgets.

====Reproducibility====
In 1989, after Fleischmann and Pons had made their claims, many research groups tried to reproduce the Fleischmann-Pons experiment, without success. A few other research groups, however, reported successful reproductions of cold fusion during this time. In July 1989, an Indian group from the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] ([[P. K. Iyengar]] and M. Srinivasan) and in October 1989, [[John Bockris|John Bockris']] group from [[Texas A&amp;M University]] reported on the creation of tritium. In December 1990, professor [[Richard Oriani]] of the [[University of Minnesota]] reported excess heat.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=364–365}}

Groups that did report successes found that some of their cells were producing the effect, while other cells that were built exactly the same and used the same materials were not producing the effect.{{sfn|ps=|Platt|1998}} Researchers that continued to work on the topic have claimed that over the years many successful replications have been made, but still have problems getting reliable replications.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=145–148}} [[Reproducibility]] is one of the main principles of the scientific method, and its lack led most physicists to believe that the few positive reports could be attributed to experimental error.{{sfn|ps=|Platt|1998}}&lt;ref group="text" name="reger"/&gt; The DOE 2004 report said among its conclusions and recommendations:

{{quote|text="Ordinarily, new scientific discoveries are claimed to be consistent and reproducible; as a result, if the experiments are not complicated, the discovery can usually be confirmed or disproved in a few months. The claims of cold fusion, however, are unusual in that even the strongest proponents of cold fusion assert that the experiments, for unknown reasons, are not consistent and reproducible at the present time. (...) Internal inconsistencies and lack of predictability and reproducibility remain serious concerns. (...) The Panel recommends that the cold fusion research efforts in the area of heat production focus primarily on confirming or disproving reports of excess heat."{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|2004}}}}

=====Loading ratio=====
[[File:Gas-ColdFusionCell-SRI-Intl-McKubre.jpg|thumb|upright|Michael McKubre working on deuterium gas-based cold fusion cell used by [[SRI International]]]]
Cold fusion researchers ([[Michael McKubre|McKubre]] since 1994,{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=145–148}} [[Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development|ENEA]] in 2011&lt;ref name=ENEA_Magazin/&gt;) have speculated that a cell that is loaded with a deuterium/palladium ratio lower than 100% (or 1:1) will not produce excess heat.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=145–148}} Since most of the negative replications from 1989–1990 did not report their ratios, this has been proposed as an explanation for failed replications.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=145–148}} This loading ratio is hard to obtain, and some batches of palladium never reach it because the pressure causes cracks in the palladium, allowing the deuterium to escape.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=145–148}} Fleischmann and Pons never disclosed the deuterium/palladium ratio achieved in their cells,{{sfn|ps=|Huizenga|1993|p=82}} there are no longer any batches of the palladium used by Fleischmann and Pons (because the supplier uses now a different manufacturing process),{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=145–148}} and researchers still have problems finding batches of palladium that achieve heat production reliably.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=145–148}}

====Misinterpretation of data====
Some research groups initially reported that they had replicated the Fleischmann and Pons results but later retracted their reports and offered an alternative explanation for their original positive results. A group at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] found problems with their neutron detector, and Texas A&amp;M discovered bad wiring in their thermometers.{{sfn|ps=|Bird|1998|pp=261–262}} These retractions, combined with negative results from some famous laboratories,{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}} led most scientists to conclude, as early as 1989, that no positive result should be attributed to cold fusion.{{sfn|ps=|Bird|1998|pp=261–262}}{{sfn|ps=|Saeta|1999|loc= (pages 5–6; "Response"; Heeter, Robert F.)}}

====Calorimetry errors====
The calculation of excess heat in electrochemical cells involves certain assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biberian|2007}}&amp;nbsp;– (Input power is calculated by multiplying current and voltage, and output power is deduced from the measurement of the temperature of the cell and that of the bath")&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in these assumptions have been offered as non-nuclear explanations for excess heat.

One assumption made by Fleischmann and Pons is that the efficiency of electrolysis is nearly 100%, meaning nearly all the electricity applied to the cell resulted in electrolysis of water, with negligible [[Joule heating|resistive heating]] and substantially all the electrolysis product leaving the cell unchanged.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}} This assumption gives the amount of energy expended converting liquid D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into gaseous D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990|loc=Appendix}} The efficiency of electrolysis is less than one if hydrogen and oxygen recombine to a significant extent within the calorimeter. Several researchers have described potential mechanisms by which this process could occur and thereby account for excess heat in electrolysis experiments.{{sfn|ps=|Shkedi|McDonald|Breen|Maguire|1995}}{{sfn|ps=|Jones|Hansen|Jones|Shelton|1995|p=1}}{{sfn|ps=|Shanahan|2002}}

Another assumption is that heat loss from the calorimeter maintains the same relationship with measured temperature as found when calibrating the calorimeter.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}} This assumption ceases to be accurate if the temperature distribution within the cell becomes significantly altered from the condition under which calibration measurements were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biberian|2007}}&amp;nbsp;– ("Almost all the heat is dissipated by radiation and follows the temperature fourth power law. The cell is calibrated . . .")&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen, for example, if fluid circulation within the cell becomes significantly altered.{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989|loc=para. 16}}{{sfn|ps=|Wilson|Bray|Kosky|Vakil|1992}} Recombination of hydrogen and oxygen within the calorimeter would also alter the heat distribution and invalidate the calibration.{{sfn|ps=|Shanahan|2002}}{{sfn|ps=|Shanahan|2005}}{{sfn|ps=|Shanahan|2006}}

== Publications ==
The [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI]] identified cold fusion as the scientific topic with the largest number of published papers in 1989, of all scientific disciplines.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=180–183, 209}} The [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Julian Schwinger]] declared himself a supporter of cold fusion in the fall of 1989, after much of the response to the initial reports had turned negative. He tried to publish his theoretical paper "Cold Fusion: A Hypothesis" in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', but the peer reviewers rejected it so harshly that he felt deeply insulted, and he resigned from the [[American Physical Society]] (publisher of ''PRL'') in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |mode=cs2 | title=Climbing the Mountain: The Scientific Biography of Julian Schwinger|author1=Jagdish Mehra |author2=K.

The number of papers sharply declined after 1990 because of two simultaneous phenomena: first, scientists abandoned the field; second, journal editors declined to review new papers. Consequently cold fusion fell off the ISI charts.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=180–183, 209}}{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=180–183}} Researchers who got negative results turned their backs on the field; those who continued to publish were simply ignored.{{sfn|ps=|Huizenga|1993|pp=208}} A 1993 paper in ''Physics Letters A'' was the last paper published by Fleischmann, and "one of the last reports [by Fleischmann] to be formally challenged on technical grounds by a cold fusion skeptic."&lt;ref group="text" name="last_challenged" /&gt;

The ''Journal of Fusion Technology'' (FT) established a permanent feature in 1990 for cold fusion papers, publishing over a dozen papers per year and giving a mainstream outlet for cold fusion researchers. When editor-in-chief [[George H. Miley]] retired in 2001, the journal stopped accepting new cold fusion papers.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=180–183}} This has been cited as an example of the importance of sympathetic influential individuals to the publication of cold fusion papers in certain journals.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=180–183}}

The decline of publications in cold fusion has been described as a "failed information epidemic".&lt;ref group="text" name="fie" /&gt; The sudden surge of supporters until roughly 50% of scientists support the theory, followed by a decline until there is only a very small number of supporters, has been described as a characteristic of [[pathological science]].&lt;ref group="text" name="pathological" /&gt;&lt;ref group="notes" name="Langmuir" /&gt; The lack of a shared set of unifying concepts and techniques has prevented the creation of a dense network of collaboration in the field; researchers perform efforts in their own and in disparate directions, making the transition to "normal" science more difficult.{{sfn|ps=|Bettencourt|Kaiser|Kaur|2009}}

Cold fusion reports continued to be published in a small cluster of specialized journals like ''[[Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry]]'' and ''[[Il Nuovo Cimento]]''. Some papers also appeared in ''[[Journal of Physical Chemistry]]'', ''[[Physics Letters A]]'', ''[[International Journal of Hydrogen Energy]]'', and a number of Japanese and Russian journals of physics, chemistry, and engineering.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=180–183}} Since 2005, ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'' has published cold fusion papers; in 2009, the journal named a cold fusion researcher to its editorial board. In 2015 the Indian multidisciplinary journal ''[[Current Science]]'' published a special section devoted entirely to cold fusion related papers.&lt;ref name="currentscience.ac.in"/&gt;

In the 1990s, the groups that continued to research cold fusion and their supporters established (non-peer-reviewed) periodicals such as ''Fusion Facts'', ''Cold Fusion Magazine'', ''[[Infinite Energy Magazine]]'' and ''New Energy Times'' to cover developments in cold fusion and other fringe claims in energy production that were ignored in other venues. The internet has also become a major means of communication and self-publication for CF researchers.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=183–187}}

== Conferences ==
Cold fusion researchers were for many years unable to get papers accepted at scientific meetings, prompting the creation of their own conferences. The first [[International Conference on Cold Fusion]] (ICCF) was held in 1990, and has met every 12 to 18 months since. Attendees at some of the early conferences were described as offering no criticism to papers and presentations for fear of giving ammunition to external critics,{{sfn|ps=|Park|2000|pp=12–13}} thus allowing the proliferation of [[Crank (person)|crackpots]] and hampering the conduct of serious science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}, the first three conferences are commented in detail in {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=237–247, 274–285}}, specially 240, 275–277&lt;/ref&gt; Critics and skeptics stopped attending these conferences, with the notable exception of Douglas Morrison,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=276}}, {{harvnb|Park|2000|pp=12–13}}, {{harvnb|Simon|2002|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; who died in 2001. With the founding in 2004 of the International Society for Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (ISCMNS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscmns.org/faq.htm#ref1|title=ISCMNS FAQ|author=|date=|website=www.iscmns.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223114431/http://www.iscmns.org/faq.htm#ref1|archivedate=23 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the conference was renamed the International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=131–133, 218}}{{sfn|ps=|Seife|2008|pp=154–155}}&lt;ref name="taubes378"&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=378, 427}} ''anomalous effects in deuterated metals,'' which was the new, preferred, politically palatable nom de science for cold fusion [back in October 1989]."&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; for reasons that are detailed in the [[#Subsequent research|subsequent research section]] below &amp;mdash; but reverted to the old name in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iscmns.org/iccf14/ProcICCF14b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731065530/http://www.iscmns.org/iccf14/ProcICCF14b.pdf |archivedate=31 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold fusion research is often referenced by proponents as "low-energy nuclear reactions", or LENR,&lt;ref name="bbc march 2009" /&gt; but according to sociologist [[Bart Simon]] the "cold fusion" label continues to serve a social function in creating a [[collective identity]] for the field.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=131–133, 218}}

Since 2006, the [[American Physical Society]] (APS) has included cold fusion sessions at their semiannual meetings, clarifying that this does not imply a softening of skepticism.&lt;ref name="aps meeting"&gt;{{harvnb|Chubb|McKubre|Krivit|Chubb|2006}}, {{harvnb|Adam|2005}} ("[Absolutely not]. Anyone can deliver a paper. We defend the openness of science"&amp;nbsp;– Bob Park of APS, when asked if hosting the meeting showed a softening of scepticism)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|ps=|Van Noorden|2007}} Since 2007, the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) meetings also include "invited symposium(s)" on cold fusion.{{sfn|ps=|Van Noorden|2007|loc=para. 2}} An ACS program chair said that without a proper forum the matter would never be discussed and, "with the world facing an energy crisis, it is worth exploring all possibilities."{{sfn|ps=|Van Noorden|2007}}

On 22–25 March 2009, the American Chemical Society meeting included a four-day symposium in conjunction with the 20th anniversary of the announcement of cold fusion. Researchers working at the U.S. Navy's [[Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center]] (SPAWAR) reported detection of energetic [[neutrons]] using a heavy water electrolysis set-up and a [[CR-39]] detector,&lt;ref name="ACS Press Release" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reignites" /&gt; a result previously published in ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]''.{{sfn|ps=|Barras|2009}} The authors claim that these neutrons are indicative of nuclear reactions;&lt;ref name="afp march 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |mode=cs2 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j2QobOQnlULUZ7oalSRUVjnlHjng |title=Scientists in possible cold fusion breakthrough |accessdate=24 March 2009 |journal= |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327020127/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j2QobOQnlULUZ7oalSRUVjnlHjng |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; without quantitative analysis of the number, energy, and timing of the neutrons and exclusion of other potential sources, this interpretation is unlikely to find acceptance by the wider scientific community.{{sfn|ps=|Barras|2009}}{{sfn|ps=|Berger|2009}}

==Patents==
Although details have not surfaced, it appears that the University of Utah forced the 23 March 1989 Fleischmann and Pons announcement to establish priority over the discovery and its patents before the joint publication with Jones.&lt;ref name="utah patent"/&gt; The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) announced on 12 April 1989 that it had applied for its own patents based on theoretical work of one of its researchers, [[Peter L. Hagelstein]], who had been sending papers to journals from the 5 to 12 April.&lt;ref name=Broad1989/&gt; On 2 December 1993 the University of Utah licensed all its cold fusion patents to ENECO, a new company created to profit from cold fusion discoveries,{{sfn|ps=|Lewenstein|1994|p=43}} and in March 1998 it said that it would no longer defend its patents.&lt;ref name="wired steam"&gt;{{cite journal |ref= harv |mode= cs2 |title= Cold Fusion Patents Run Out of Steam |author= Wired News Staff Email |date= 24 March 1998 |publisher= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url= https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1998/03/11179 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140104170533/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1998/03/11179 |archivedate= 4 January 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) now rejects patents claiming cold fusion.&lt;ref name="Weinberger2004"/&gt; Esther Kepplinger, the deputy commissioner of patents in 2004, said that this was done using the same argument as with [[perpetual motion machine]]s: that they do not work.&lt;ref name="Weinberger2004"/&gt; Patent applications are required to show that the invention is "useful", and this [[Utility (patent)|utility]] is dependent on the invention's ability to function.&lt;ref name="incredible"/&gt; In general USPTO rejections on the sole grounds of the invention's being "inoperative" are rare, since such rejections need to demonstrate "proof of total incapacity",&lt;ref name="incredible"/&gt; and cases where those rejections are upheld in a Federal Court are even rarer: nevertheless, in 2000, a rejection of a cold fusion patent was appealed in a Federal Court and it was upheld, in part on the grounds that the inventor was unable to establish the utility of the invention.&lt;ref name="incredible"/&gt;&lt;ref group="notes" name="patent case"/&gt;

A U.S. patent might still be granted when given a different name to disassociate it from cold fusion,{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=193, 233}} though this strategy has had little success in the US: the same claims that need to be patented can identify it with cold fusion, and most of these patents cannot avoid mentioning Fleischmann and Pons' research due to legal constraints, thus alerting the patent reviewer that it is a cold-fusion-related patent.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=193, 233}} David Voss said in 1999 that some patents that closely resemble cold fusion processes, and that use materials used in cold fusion, have been granted by the USPTO.&lt;ref name="voss-science"/&gt; The inventor of three such patents had his applications initially rejected when they were reviewed by experts in nuclear science; but then he rewrote the patents to focus more in the electrochemical parts so they would be reviewed instead by experts in electrochemistry, who approved them.&lt;ref name="voss-science"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv |mode=cs2 |title=A Case Study of Inoperable Inventions: Why Is the USPTO Patenting Pseudoscience? |author=Daniel C.

At least one patent related to cold fusion has been granted by the [[European Patent Office]].&lt;ref name=Fox1994a/&gt;

A patent only legally prevents others from using or benefiting from one's invention. However, the general public perceives a patent as a stamp of approval, and a holder of three cold fusion patents said the patents were very valuable and had helped in getting investments.&lt;ref name="voss-science"/&gt;

==Cultural references==
A 1990  [[Michael Winner]] film ''[[Bullseye! (1990 film)|Bullseye!]]'', starring [[Michael Caine]] and [[Roger Moore]], referenced the Fleischmann and Pons experiment. The film — a comedy — concerned conmen trying to steal scientists' purported findings. However, the film had a poor reception, described as "appallingly unfunny".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Radio Times Guide to Films 2014 |journal=[[Radio Times]] |isbn=978-0956752369 |pages=181{{ndash}}182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Undead Science'', sociologist Bart Simon gives some examples of cold fusion in popular culture, saying that some scientists use cold fusion as a synonym for outrageous claims made with no supporting proof,{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=91–95, 116–118}} and courses of ethics in science give it as an example of pathological science.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=91–95, 116–118}} It has appeared as a joke in ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=91–95, 116–118}} It was adopted as a software product name [[Adobe ColdFusion]] and a brand of protein bars (Cold Fusion Foods).{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=91–95, 116–118}} It has also appeared in advertising as a synonym for impossible science, for example a 1995 advertisement for [[Pepsi Max]].{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=91–95, 116–118}}

The plot of ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]'', a 1997 action-adventure film, parallels the story of Fleischmann and Pons, although with a different ending.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=91–95, 116–118}} The film might have affected the public perception of cold fusion, pushing it further into the science fiction realm.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=91–95, 116–118}}

"[[Final Exam (The Outer Limits)|Final Exam]]", the 16th episode of season 4 of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', depicts a student named Todtman who has invented a cold fusion weapon, and attempts to use it as a tool for revenge on people who have wronged him over the years. Despite the secret being lost with his death at the end of the episode, it is implied that another student elsewhere is on a similar track, and may well repeat Todtman's efforts.

In the ''[[DC's Legends of Tomorrow]]'' episode "No Country for Old Dads," Ray Palmer theorizes that cold fusion could repair the shattered Fire Totem, if it wasn't only theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6464560/|title=No Country for Old Dads|author=|date=5 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213195325/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6464560/|archivedate=13 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damien Dahrk reveals that he assassinated a scientist in 1962 East Germany that developed a formula for cold fusion. Ray and Dahrk's daughter Nora time travel from 2018 to 1962 in an attempt to rescue the scientist from the younger version of Dahrk and/or retrieve the formula.

&lt;ref group="notes" name="differences"&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=228–229, 255}} "(...) there are indeed chemical differences between heavy and light water, especially once lithium is added, as it was in the Pons-Fleischmann electrolyte. This had been in the scientific literature since 1958. It seems that the electrical conductivity of heavy water with lithium is considerably less than that of light water with lithium. And this difference is more than enough to account for the heavy water cell running hotter (...) (quoting a member of the A&amp;M group) 'they're making the same mistake we did'"&lt;/ref&gt;

(...) theory can even accommodate the subtle variations in the ratio at these low temperatures [below 200 °C, where the first channel predominates due to 'molecular resonance excitation']", {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=6–7, 35–36, 75, 108–109, 112–114, 118–125, 130, 139, 173, 183, 217–218, 243–245}} "[page 7] [the first two branches of the reaction] have been studied over a range of deuteron kinetic energies down to a few kiloelectron volts (keV).

[page 108] The near equality of [the first two reaction branches] has been verified also for muon-catalyzed fusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4798">The '''continuum concept''' is an idea, coined by [[Jean Liedloff]] in her 1975 book '''''The Continuum Concept''''', that [[human being]]s have an [[innate]] set of expectations (which Liedloff calls the '''continuum''') that our evolution as a species has designed us to meet in order to achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional [[Human development (biology)|development and adaptability]]. According to Liedloff, in order to achieve this level of development, young humans—especially babies—require the kind of experience to which our species adapted during the long process of [[human evolution|our evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. For infants, these include, for example, that they experience:

*Immediate placement, after birth, in their mothers' arms: Liedloff comments that the common hospital protocol of immediately separating a newborn from its mother may hormonally disrupt the mother, possibly explaining high rates of [[postpartum depression]];
*Constant carrying or physical contact with other people (usually their mothers or fathers) in the several months after birth, as these adults go about their day-to-day business (during which the infants observe and thus learn, but also nurse, or sleep); this forms a strong basis of personal security for infants, according to Liedloff, from which they will begin developing a healthy drive for independent exploration by eventually starting to naturally creep, and then crawl, usually at six to eight months; She calls this the "In-Arms" phase.
* Sleeping in the parents' bed (called [[co-sleeping]]), in constant physical contact, until leaving of their own volition (often about two years); 
* [[Breastfeeding]] "on cue"&amp;mdash;involving infants' bodily signals being immediately answered by their mothers' nursing them; 
* Caregivers' immediate response to the infants' urgent body signals (flaring temper, crying, sniffling, etc.), without judgment, displeasure, or invalidation of the children's needs, but also not showing any undue concern or focusing on or overindulging the children; 
* Sensing (and fulfilling) elders' expectations that the infants are innately social and cooperative and have strong self-preservation instincts, and that they are welcome and worthy (yet without making them the constant center of attention)

[[File:Namibian woman with her baby on her back.jpg|thumb|Namibian woman with her baby on her back]]

Liedloff suggests that when certain evolutionary expectations are not met as infants and toddlers, compensation for these needs will be sought, by alternate means, throughout life—resulting in many forms of mental and social disorders. She also argues that these expectations are largely distorted, neglected, and/or not properly met in civilized cultures which have removed themselves from the natural evolutionary process, resulting in the aforementioned abnormal psychological and social conditions. Liedloff's recommendations fit in more generally with [[evolutionary psychology]], [[attachment theory]], and the philosophy known as the [[Paleolithic lifestyle]]: optimizing well-being by living more like our [[hunter-gatherer]] ancestors, who Liedloff refers to as "evolved" humans, since their lifeways developed through natural selection by living in the wild.

The '''[[Denmark|Danish]] bicycle [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]]-system''' is a system introduced in 1942 by the Danish government, providing all [[bicycle]]s in Denmark with a unique code. The code is a combination of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] and [[Numerical digit|digits]] embedded into the [[bicycle frame]] and consists of a manufacturer code, a serial number, and construction year code.

Since 1948, it has been illegal&lt;ref name='law135of1948'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=122988 | title = Lov nr. 135 af 23. marts 1948: Bekendtgørelse af lov om mærkning af cykelstel m.v. | accessdate = 2011-06-18 | date = 1948-03-23 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sell bicycle frames in Denmark without an embedded VIN. Because of this, insurance companies in Denmark will not pay [[Insurance claim|indemnities]] for stolen bicycles without a VIN.&lt;ref name='dr1'&gt;{{cite news | first = Preben | last = Lund | title = Demand for marking of stolen goods | date = 2011-06-12 | url = http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2011/06/12/010459.htm | work = DR Nyheder | accessdate = 2011-06-18 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location of the VIN ==
By default, the VIN is to be [[Engraving|engraved]] into the [[Bicycle frame#Seat_tube|seat tube]] or the [[Bicycle frame#Down_tube|down tube]], but if these are made of such a material that hinders this, it may alternately be put on the [[Bottom bracket|bottom bracket shell]]. In very special instances, and only with the approval of the [[Rigspolitiet#Leadership|Danish National Police Commissioner’s Office]], it may be applied by other means and on other locations.&lt;ref name="law135of1948"/&gt;

== Components of the VIN ==
The bicycle VIN is constructed of three elements: a letter-block, a digit-block and a letter-block:

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"

The manufacturers-code, is a 1, 2, 3 or 4-letter block. If the code starts with a W, it is an imported bicycle frame. The second block is the frame serial number from that manufacturer. This shall have at least one digit, but can otherwise have any number of digits. The third block is a single letter code that identifies the production year. Certain limits regarding letters are instated for the VIN:&lt;ref name='askalex'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ask-alex.dk/artikler/Haandbogen/Bil-&amp;-Cykel/Find-cyklens-alder/e_140_3644.page |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311211953/http://www.ask-alex.dk/artikler/Haandbogen/Bil-%26-Cykel/Find-cyklens-alder/e_140_3644.page |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-11 |title=How to decode the bicycles age |accessdate=2011-07-07 |author=Dansk Cyklist Forbund |language=Danish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* I is omitted as it can be confused with 1 (one)
* O is omitted as it can be confused with 0 (zero)
* Y is omitted as it can be confused with V
* Since 1956 Q is omitted, as it can be confused with 0 (zero)
* W is omitted, to avoid confusion with the manufacturer code (where W is reserved for imported frames)

In the examples above, the first bicycle is a bicycle imported by FDB, with serial number ''1234'' and made in either 1963, 1984 or 2005. The second bike is a SCO bicycle, with serial number ''57'', made in 1942, 1964, 1985 or 2006.

The '''DeLano Award for Computational Biosciences''' is a prize in the field of [[computational biology]]. It is awarded annually for "the most accessible and innovative development or application of computer technology to enhance research in the life sciences at the molecular level".&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web|title=DeLano Award for Computational Biosciences|url=http://www.asbmb.org/Page.aspx?id=6130|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize was established by the [[American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]] (ASBMB) in memory of [[Warren Lyford DeLano]], an American bioinformatician. DeLano developed the [[PyMOL]] open source molecular viewer software and was an advocate for the increased adoption of open source practices in the sciences. DeLano died unexpectedly in 2009.&lt;ref name="urlWarren L.

The '''Debussy''' [[quadrangle (geography)|quadrangle]] (H-14) is one of [[List of quadrangles on Mercury|fifteen quadrangles on Mercury]]. It runs from 270 to 360° longitude and from -20 to -70° latitude. Named after the [[Debussy (crater)|Debussy]] crater, it was mapped in detail for the first time after ''[[MESSENGER]]'' entered orbit around [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 2011. It had not been mapped prior to that point because it was one of the six quadrangles that was not illuminated when ''[[Mariner 10]]'' made its flybys in 1974 and 1975.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5081">The '''European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences''' ''(Premio Europeo Amalfi per la Sociologia e le Scienze Sociali)'' is a prestigious [[Italy|Italian]] award in the social sciences. Established in 1987 on the initiative of the Section for Sociological Theories and Social Transformations of the [[Italian Association of Sociology]], it is conferred annually in [[Amalfi]] to the author of a  book or an article which was published within the previous two years and has made an important contribution to sociology.

The award ceremony is accompanied by an international sociological conference.
The awardees are selected by a jury currently consisting of [[Margaret Archer]], [[Allessandro Cavalli]], [[Salvador Giner]], [[Joachim Israel]], [[Michel Maffesoli]], [[Carlo Mongardini]] (chair), [[Birgitta Nedelmann]], [[Helga Nowotny]], and [[Piotr Sztompka]]. Previous members include [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Peter Gerlich]] and [[Friedrich H. Tenbruck]].

The award was suspended in 1993 and 1996, 1992 and 2011-2015 the jury decided not to assign the award.

In 1999, a biennial special award for an outstanding first book was established and named after Norbert Elias, the first recipient of the Amalfi Award. There are also other auxiliary awards in various categories; the main award can also be split.

Frost boils are amongst the most common features of [[patterned ground]], the pervasive process shaping the topology of soils in [[periglacial]] regions. They generally form regular patterns of polygons. Frost boils are a type of nonsorted [[Patterned ground#circles|circle]], and are characterized from other circles by barren centres of mineral soil and intercircle regions filled with vegetation and peat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=R.

Frost boils have been observed on [[Mars]], indicating the presence of periglacial processes similar to those on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-11-01|title=Mars periglacial punctual features analyses|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063312002899|journal=Planetary and Space Science|language=en|volume=72|issue=1|pages=53–61|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2012.09.014|issn=0032-0633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
The most accepted theory involves [[cryoturbation]] caused by differences in moisture conditions and ground temperature. Other recent research posits that frost boils are formed by several interacting mechanisms, including [[Frost heaving|differential frost heaving]], [[Load cast|load casting]], [[convection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Vliet-Lanoë|first=Brigitte|date=1991|title=Differential frost heave, load casting and convection: Converging mechanisms; a discussion of the origin of cryoturbations|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ppp.3430020207|journal=Permafrost and Periglacial Processes|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=123–139|doi=10.1002/ppp.3430020207|issn=1045-6740|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Frost weathering|frost cracking]], [[Displacement (fluid)|mass displacement]], and [[Sorting (sediment)|soil sorting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-11-01|title=Mars periglacial punctual features analyses|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063312002899|journal=Planetary and Space Science|language=en|volume=72|issue=1|pages=53–61|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2012.09.014|issn=0032-0633}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional model of injection, however, may still apply for some frost boils. Models generally presume soil is predominately silt or clay, for the reasons listed under the injection subsection.

=== Injection ===
Frost boils occur in soils of poorly-sorted sediments with significant silt and/or clay content. These soils include perennially frozen [[till]], [[marine clay]], [[colluvium]], and other [[Mud|muds]]. These soils have low [[Atterberg limits#Liquid limit|liquid limits]], low [[Plastic limit|plasticity limits]], and high natural moisture contents. These soils liquefy and flow readily in response to slight changes to either internal or external stress, or a change in water content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shilts|first=William W.|date=1978|title=Nature and genesis of mudboils, central Keewatin, Canada|url=https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrcresearchpress.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1139%2Fe78-113|journal=Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=15|issue=7|pages=1053–1068|doi=10.1139/e78-113|issn=0008-4077|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Localized stresses are often the result of moisture being confined in the [[active layer]] by the underlying permafrost and a semi-rigid carapace of dried surface mud, created by [[desiccation]] during the late summer. The moisture content of soils may increase during summer due to rain. Other stresses include the volumetric change of water during the freezing and thawing, and the flow of groundwater.  

The subsequent increase of [[Hydrostatics|hydrostatic]], [[Artesian aquifer|artesian]], and/or [[pore water pressure]] pressures on slopes. When internal stresses cannot be contained, the semi-rigid surface layer ruptures. The saturated mud bursts above the surface, creating a mud boil. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=French|first=Hugh M.|date=2007-01-26|title=The Periglacial Environment|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118684931|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=243|doi=10.1002/9781118684931|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===[[Liquefaction|Soil Liquefaction]]===
This process is analogous to the formation of [[Sand boil|sand boils]]. Where soils are badly drained, soil temperatures are more sensitive to changes in the atmospheric temperature. [[Soil aggregate stability|Soil aggregates]] are less stable near the surface as freezing occurs more rapidly. Deeper soils experience longer periods of stability due to [[Freeze-drying|freeze drying]], or cryodesiccation. Deeper soils also experience greater stresses due to the [[Frost heaving#Micro-scale processes|secondary refreezing of soil]] in late autumn. As a result, the introduction of additional water due to thaw or groundwater flows is likely to cause deeper soil to [[Soil liquefaction|liquefy]] and deform like plastic. The high viscosity of water close to 0°C promotes aggregate explosion and particle dispersion. 

This process is commonplace in alpine regions where soil temperatures rarely drop below -10°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Vliet-Lanoë|first=Brigitte|date=1991|title=Differential frost heave, load casting and convection: Converging mechanisms; a discussion of the origin of cryoturbations|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ppp.3430020207|journal=Permafrost and Periglacial Processes|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=123–139|doi=10.1002/ppp.3430020207|issn=1045-6740|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyroturbation ===
&lt;div class="mod-gallery mod-gallery-default mod-gallery-center"&gt;
Soil that are silty or loamy, as described above, can hold larger moisture contents. Thus, segregated ice lenses are formed preferentially in these locations. The soil thus experiences greater [[frost heave]] than surrounding regions, becoming more highly elevated than its surroundings. Although the ice lenses melt during summer, the ground does not fully subside into its original elevation and remains at a slightly higher elevation than before. Over years, soil particles are preferentially transported upwards to form a frost boil. At the surface of the boil, [[soil creep]] takes place and soil are transported towards the rim where it is inter-mixed with organic soil from the active layer. Over many years, this process creates distinct organic soil horizons in inter-boil areas. Permeating ground water eventually carry dissolved organic material and particles downwards through the process of [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]]. These particles accumulates in segregated ice lenses, and the cycle repeats.

Cyroturbation of this form is a slow process, often taking centuries for a single cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Donald A.|last2=Epstein|first2=Howard E.|last3=Gould|first3=William A.|last4=Kelley|first4=Alexia M.|last5=Kade|first5=Anja N.|last6=Knudson|first6=Julie A.|last7=Krantz|first7=William B.|last8=Michaelson|first8=Gary|last9=Peterson|first9=Rorik A.|date=2004|title=Frost-boil ecosystems: complex interactions between landforms, soils, vegetation and climate|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ppp.487|journal=Permafrost and Periglacial Processes|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=171–188|doi=10.1002/ppp.487|issn=1045-6740|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internal characteristics ==
&lt;/div&gt;
[[Frost heaving]] is greater at the center of frost boils when compared to the margins of frost boils due to the ice-rich conditions at the center and vegetative cover at the margins. Due to the higher moisture content, ice predominantly form [[Ice segregation|segregated ice lenses]] in shallow soils near the center of the frost boil. Moisture content at the margins, however, are predominantly in the form of pore ice. Ground subsistence at the center of frost boils during thawing season is correspondingly more rapid and of a greater magnitude when compared to the margins. Subsidence at the margins advances slowly in the earlier thawing period but increases to rates comparable to center by mid-summer. [[File:Huge frost boil.jpg|thumb]]Measurements conducted on frost boils in [[Adventdalen|Adventdalen, Svalbard]] has found that the ground subsistence rates at center of frost boils of averaged 8 mm per day during late May but decreased to less than 1 mm per day in mid-July. The same found that heaving was considerably greater at centers (c. 9.5 mm per day) than margins (c. 1.6 mm per day). Correspondingly, [[ice core]] analyses conducted on frost boils has found that samples extracted from the center of Frost Boils have higher concentration of ice lenses in shallow soils, when compared to cores extracted from marginal and intercircle regions. Most ice lenses have a diameter smaller than 3 mm. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watanabe|first=Tatsuya|last2=Matsuoka|first2=Norikazu|last3=Christiansen|first3=Hanne H.|date=2012|title=Mudboil and ice‐wedge dynamics investigated by electrical resistivity tomography, ground temperatures and surface movements in svalbard|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-0459.2012.00470.x?needAccess=true|journal=Geografiska Annaler: Series A, Physical Geography|language=en|volume=94|issue=4|pages=445–457|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0459.2012.00470.x|issn=0435-3676|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topology ==
Frost boils often occur in groups, and may form terraces if a series of them occur on a slope. On slopes, frost boils are sometimes protected from erosion by a thin layer of [[Moss|mosses]] and [[Lichen|lichens]] which retains moisture through surface tension as sediments flow downslope to form a lobe. These landforms eventually settle like a [[Continuous track|caterpillar track]].

Common characteristics of landforms created by frost boils include a bowl-shaped boil, an elevated center, a formation of an organic layer on the outer edge, and resistance of the soil surface to vegetation colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shur|first=Y|last2=Ping|first2=C|date=2003|title=The Driving Force of Frost Boils and Hummocks Formation|url=|journal=American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2003|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drainage on frost boils differs as a result of micro relief across the frost boil surface. In warm seasons (summer), the elevated center of the frost boil is moderately well drained compared to the depressed inter boil. The permafrost table surface is also affected by differing activity across the boil. The inner boil is more active and generally has more than twice the active depth than the inter boil, which causes the permafrost table surface to be in a nearly perfect bowl shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ping|first=C.L.|author2=G. J. Michaelson|author3=J. M. Kimble|author4=Y. L. Shur|author5=D. A. Walker|date=Nov 2002|title=Morphogenesis of Soils Associate With Frost Boils|volume=83|pages=F259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biology ==
Frost boils may be the predominant form of topology and [[patterned ground]] in tundras. Three elements of frost boils may repeat over large areas: patches (the center of frost boils), rims, and troughs. The density of these elements are higher in the high arctic when compared to southern tundras. Each element of frost boils is a distinct [[microecosystem]]. Although vegetation is rare on patches, it may host many species of small [[Moss|mosses]], [[Crustose lichen|crustose lichens]], and solitary small [[Vascular plant|vascular plants]]. Well-developed moss covers the surface of most rims and troughs. Rims and troughs are also home to a large number of [[Herb|herbs]] and small or stunted [[Shrub|shrubs]].&lt;ref&gt;Chernov, Y.I. &amp; Matveyeva, N. V., 1997, ‘Arctic ecosystem in Russia’, in F.E. Wielgolaski (ed.), Ecosystems of the World, p. 411-412, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arctic soils acidify over time due to the presence of aerobic bacteria which breaks down water-soluble salts within soil moisture, reducing the fertility of most periglacial regions. [[Cryoturbation]] within active frost boils may allow water containing basic salts to permeate from depth to the surface, neutralizing soil acidity and replenishing the supply of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=R. A.|last2=Krantz|first2=W. B.|date=2008-09-01|title=Differential frost heave model for patterned ground formation: Corroboration with observations along a North American arctic transect|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007JG000559#jgrg306-fig-0001|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=G3|pages=1-2|doi=10.1029/2007jg000559#jgrg306-fig-0001|issn=2156-2202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrients in plant matter, particularly carbon and nitrogen, are deposited and concentrated in troughs. These nutrients are intensely recycled in each stage of [[ecological succession]]. Troughs thus have an overall higher net ecosystem production and carbon accumulation rate than patches. Other reasons contributing to the greater carbon accumulation in troughs include a higher soil moisture content that makes troughs unfavorable for [[decomposition]]. Troughs may also have a higher carbon content due to it being older and having experienced a longer period of soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=C.|last2=Meyer|first2=H.|last3=Biasi|first3=C.|last4=Rusalimova|first4=O.|last5=Barsukov|first5=P.|last6=Richter|first6=A.|date=2005|title=Storage and mineralization of carbon and nitrogen in soils of a frost-boil tundra ecosystem in Siberia|url=http://journals.scholarsportal.info/details/09291393/v29i0002/173_samocaafteis.xml|journal=Applied Soil Ecology|volume=29|issue=2|pages=173–183|doi=10.1016/j.apsoil.2004.10.005|issn=0929-1393}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The presence of plants affect the development of frost boils. In the high arctic where plants are rare, physical processes of heave and soil formation are dominant. In warmer temperate regions, dense vegetation insulates inter-boil areas, lowering soil temperatures and decreasing the potential for heave. The strong contrast between vegetated inter-boil regions and center patches lead to maximum differential heave, resulting in frost boils being better developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Donald A.|last2=Epstein|first2=Howard E.|last3=Gould|first3=William A.|last4=Kelley|first4=Alexia M.|last5=Kade|first5=Anja N.|last6=Knudson|first6=Julie A.|last7=Krantz|first7=William B.|last8=Michaelson|first8=Gary|last9=Peterson|first9=Rorik A.|date=2004|title=Frost-boil ecosystems: complex interactions between landforms, soils, vegetation and climate|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ppp.487|journal=Permafrost and Periglacial Processes|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=183-184|doi=10.1002/ppp.487|issn=1045-6740|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:P53.png|thumb|The p53 protein, shown interacting with a strand of [[DNA]], is overexpressed in HT-29 cells]]
Initially derived in 1964 by Jorden Fogh from a 44-year-old Caucasian female, HT-29 cells form a tight monolayer while exhibiting similarity to [[enterocytes]] from the [[small intestine]]. HT-29 cells overproduce the [[p53]] tumor antigen, but have a mutation in the p53 gene at position 273, resulting in a [[histidine]] replacing an [[arginine]]. The cells proliferate rapidly in media containing [[suramin]], with corresponding high expression of the ''[[c-myc]]'' oncogene. However, ''c-myc'' is deregulated, but may have a relation with the growth factor requirements of HT-29 cells.&lt;ref name=two /&gt;

==Applications==
In preclinical research, HT-29 cells have been studied for their ability to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] and thus simulate real colon tissue ''in vitro'', a characteristic that has made HT-29 useful for [[epithelial]] cell research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=HT-29 cells are an in vitro model for the generation of cell polarity in epithelia during embryonic differentiation|first1=M|last1=Hirn|display-authors=etal|date=1988|pmc=279498|volume=85|issue=1|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=136–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells can also be tested ''in vivo'' via [[xenografts]] with rodents. HT-29 cells terminally differentiate into enterocytes with the replacement of [[glucose]] by [[galactose]] in cell culture, and with the addition of [[butyrate]] or acids, the differentiation pathways can be closely studied along with their dependence on surrounding conditions.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Accordingly, studies of HT-29 cells have shown induced differentation as a result of [[forskolin]], [[Colchicine]], [[nocodazole]], and [[taxol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Induced differentiation in HT29, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line|pmid=10413674|first1=E|last1=Cohen|display-authors=etal|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=August 1999|volume=112|pages=2657–2666}}&lt;/ref&gt; with galactose-mediated differentiation also causing the strengthening of [[adherens junctions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Early enterocytic differentiation of HT-29 cells: biochemical changes and strength increases of adherens junctions|first1=S|last1=Gout|display-authors=etal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482704003386|journal=Experimental Cell Research|volume=299|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.06.008|date=1 October 2004|pages=498–510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culturing===
Though HT-29 cells can proliferate in cell culture lacking growth factors with a doubling time of around 4 days, the doubling time can be reduced to one day with added [[fetal bovine serum]].&lt;ref name=two&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proliferation of the Human Colon Carcinoma Cell Line HT29: Autocrine Growth and Deregulated Expression of the c-myc Oncogene|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/49/23/6566.full.pdf|journal=Cancer Research|volume=49|pages=6566–6571|date=1 December 1989|first1= Anne-Marie |last1=Coudray|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells have high glucose consumption, and in standard medium containing 25 mM glucose and 10% serum, remain undifferentiated.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2511">In systematics, an '''ideotype''' is a specimen identified as belonging to a specific taxon by the author of that taxon, but collected from somewhere other than the type locality.

The concept of ideotype in [[plant breeding]] was introduced by Donald in 1968 to describe the idealized appearance of a plant variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Donald |first=C. M. |date=December 1968 |title=The breeding of crop ideotypes |journal=Euphytica |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=385–403 |doi=10.1007/BF00056241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It literally means 'a form denoting an idea'. According to Donald, ideotype is a biological model which is expected to perform or behave in a particular manner within a defined environment: "a crop ideotype is a plant model, which is expected to yield a greater quantity or quality of grain, oil or other useful product when developed as a cultivar." Donald and Hamblin (1976) proposed the concepts of isolation, competition and crop ideotypes. Market ideotype, climatic ideotype, edaphic ideotype, stress ideotype and disease/pest ideotypes are its other concepts. The term ideotype has the following synonyms: model plant type, ideal model plant type and ideal plan type.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, B. D. (2001) Plant Breeding. Kalyani Publications, Ludhiana-141 008 India {{ISBN|81-7663-600-2}} (first published in 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used in [[cognitive science]] and [[cognitive psychology]], where Ronaldo Vigo (2011, 2013, 2014) introduced it to refer to a type of concept metarepresentation that is a compound memory trace consisting of the structural information detected by humans in categorical stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vigo, R |title=Towards a Law of Invariance in Human Conceptual Behavior |journal=In L.

He is currently chairman and CEO of Biotechonomy LLC, a life sciences research and investment firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-07/juan-enriquez-discusses-advances-in-synthetic-biology-video.html|title=Juan Enriquez Discusses Advances in Synthetic Biology|date=7 July 2010|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|accessdate=11 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402073343/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-07/juan-enriquez-discusses-advances-in-synthetic-biology-video.html|archivedate=2 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=8074080&amp;privcapId=25238113|title=Juan Enriquez: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-10-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301135254/https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=8074080&amp;privcapId=25238113|archivedate=1 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written several articles, including "Transforming Life, Transforming Business: the Life Science Revolution," which was co-authored with Ray Goldberg and which received a [[McKinsey Prize]] in 2000 (2nd place). Enríquez also co-authored the first map of global [[nucleotide]] data flow, as well as HBS's working papers on "Life Sciences in Arabic Speaking Countries," "Global Life Science Data Flows and the IT industry," "[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]], [[Smallpox]], and Business Unusual," and "Technology, Gene Research and National Competitiveness." ''Harvard Business School Interactive'' picked Enríquez as one of the best teachers at the school, and showcased his work in its first set of faculty products.

The ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' showcased his ideas as one of the breakthrough concepts in its first HBR List. ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' profiled him as "Mr. Gene." The [[Van Heyst Group]] asked him to co-organize the life sciences summit commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of [[DNA]]. The summit "The Future of Life" was sponsored by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. ''[[Seed (magazine)|Seed]]'' picked his ideas as one of fifty that "shaped our identity, our culture, and the world as we know it".

==Business ventures==
Enríquez serves on a variety of boards including: [[Cabot Corporation]], Zipongo, ShapeUp, [[Synthetic Genomics]], the [[Harvard Medical School]] Genetics Advisory Council, the Chairman's International Council of the [[Americas Society]], the Visiting Committee of Harvard's [[David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies|David Rockefeller Center]], [[Tufts University]]'s [[EPIIC]], TED's Brain Trust, Harvard Business School's PAPSAC, [[WGBH Educational Foundation|WGBH]], and the [[Museum of Science (Boston)]].

Enríquez joined a multi-stage world sailing discovery voyage led by [[J. Craig Venter]], who sequenced the [[human genome]]. The expedition voyage sampled microbial [[genome]]s throughout the world's oceans. This expedition involved a number of institutions and top scholars including [[The Institute for Genomic Research]], [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], The [[Explorers Club]], and Prof. [[E. O. Wilson]]. It also led to the discovery of an unprecedented number of new species.

Enríquez served as CEO of [[Mexico City|Mexico]] City's Urban Development Corporation, coordinator general of economic policy and chief of staff for Mexico's secretary of state, and as a member of the peace commission that negotiated the cease-fire in [[Chiapas]]' [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/speakers/juan_enriquez.html|title=Juan Enriquez Profile on TED.com|accessdate=6 June 2012|work=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604140438/http://www.ted.com/speakers/juan_enriquez.html|archivedate=4 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biotechonomy.com/juan.htm|title=Juan Enriquez Bio on Biotechonomy|accessdate=6 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620183202/http://www.biotechonomy.com/juan.htm|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Juno''''' is a [[NASA]] [[space probe]] orbiting the planet [[Jupiter]]. It was built by [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems|Lockheed Martin]] and is operated by [[NASA]]{{'s}} [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]. The spacecraft was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] on August 5, 2011 ([[UTC]]), as part of the [[New Frontiers program]],&lt;ref name=blastoff&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunn |first=Marcia |title=NASA probe blasts off for Jupiter after launch-pad snags |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44034674/ns/technology_and_science-space/ |work=MSN |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered a [[polar orbit]] of Jupiter on July 5, 2016 (UTC),&lt;ref name="NYT-20160705"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20160628"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=NASA's Juno Spacecraft Will Soon Be in Jupiter's Grip |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/science/nasa-jupiter-juno.html |date=June 28, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to begin a scientific investigation of the planet.&lt;ref name=JunoMission&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Mission Jupiter |publisher=[[Science (TV network)|Science Channel]] |format=Television documentary |first=Dan |last=Riskin |date=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing its mission, ''Juno'' will be intentionally deorbited into Jupiter's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="JunoMission"/&gt;

''Juno''{{'s}} mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, [[gravity field]], [[magnetic field]], and [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|polar magnetosphere]]. It will also search for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, [[mass distribution]], and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to {{convert|618|km/h|mph|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/jupiter_lrs.html |title=Winds in Jupiter's Little Red Spot Almost Twice as Fast as Strongest Hurricane |publisher=NASA |first1=Andrew |last1=Cheng |first2=Mike |last2=Buckley |first3=Bill |last3=Steigerwald |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Juno'' is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the [[nuclear power]]ed [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' orbiter]], which orbited from 1995 to 2003.&lt;ref name="JunoMission"/&gt; Unlike all earlier spacecraft sent to the outer planets,&lt;ref name="JunoMission"/&gt; ''Juno'' is powered by [[Solar panel|solar arrays]], commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the [[Solar System#Inner Solar System|inner Solar System]], whereas [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s are commonly used for missions to the [[Solar System#Outer Solar System|outer Solar System]] and beyond. For ''Juno'', however, the three largest solar array wings ever deployed on a planetary probe play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft as well as generating power.&lt;ref name="Juno Solar Cells"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/launch/Juno_solarpower.html |title=Juno's Solar Cells Ready to Light Up Jupiter Mission |publisher=NASA |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Juno''{{'s}} name comes from [[classical mythology|Greek and Roman mythology]].

During the science mission, [[infrared]] and [[microwave]] instruments will measure the thermal radiation emanating from deep within [[Atmosphere of Jupiter|Jupiter's atmosphere]]. These observations will complement previous studies of its composition by assessing the abundance and distribution of water, and therefore oxygen. This data will provide insight into Jupiter's origins. ''Juno'' will also investigate the [[convection]] that drives natural circulation patterns in Jupiter's atmosphere. Other instruments aboard ''Juno'' will gather data about its gravitational field and polar [[magnetosphere]]. The ''Juno'' mission was planned to conclude in February 2018, after completing 37 orbits of Jupiter. The probe was then intended to be [[Atmospheric entry#Deorbit disposal|de-orbited]] and burn up in Jupiter's outer atmosphere,&lt;ref name="NYT-20160705" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20150921"&gt;{{cite web |last=Greicius |first=Tony |title=Juno – Mission Overview |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html |date=September 21, 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid any possibility of impact and biological contamination of one of its moons.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt;

=== Flight trajectory ===

==== Launch ====
''Juno'' was launched atop the [[Atlas V]] at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The Atlas V (AV-029) used a Russian-built [[RD-180]] main engine, powered by [[kerosene]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. At ignition it underwent checkout 3.8&amp;nbsp;seconds prior to the ignition of five strap-on [[solid rocket booster]]s (SRBs). Following the SRB burnout, about 93 seconds into the flight, two of the spent boosters fell away from the vehicle, followed 1.5&amp;nbsp;seconds later by the remaining three. When heating levels had dropped below predetermined limits, the [[payload fairing]] that protected ''Juno'' during launch and transit through the thickest part of the atmosphere separated, about 3&amp;nbsp;minutes 24&amp;nbsp;seconds into the flight. The Atlas&amp;nbsp;V main engine cut off 4&amp;nbsp;minutes 26&amp;nbsp;seconds after liftoff. Sixteen seconds later, the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur second stage]] ignited, and it burned for about 6&amp;nbsp;minutes, putting the satellite into an initial [[parking orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/atlas/av029/ascenttimeline.html |title=Atlas/Juno launch timeline |date=July 28, 2011 |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle coasted for about 30 minutes, and then the Centaur was reignited for a second firing of 9&amp;nbsp;minutes, placing the spacecraft on an Earth escape trajectory in a [[heliocentric orbit]].

Prior to separation, the Centaur stage used onboard [[reaction engine]]s to spin ''Juno'' up to 1.4&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|r.p.m.]]. About 54&amp;nbsp;minutes after launch, the spacecraft separated from the Centaur and began to extend its [[solar panel]]s. Following the full deployment and locking of the solar panels, ''Juno''{{'s}} batteries began to recharge. Deployment of the solar panels reduced ''Juno''{{'s}} spin rate by two-thirds. The probe is spun to ensure stability during the voyage and so that all instruments on the probe are able to observe Jupiter.&lt;ref name=Profile&gt;[http://www.spaceflight101.com/juno-mission-profile-and-timeline.html Juno Mission Profile &amp; Timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125214512/http://www.spaceflight101.com/juno-mission-profile-and-timeline.html |date=November 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/launch/Juno_solarpower.html |title=Juno's Solar Cells Ready to Light Up Jupiter Mission |first=NASA |last=Administrator |date=June 27, 2016 |publisher= |accessdate=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Orbit and environment ====
[[File:Juno trajectory through radiation belts.png|thumb|right|''Juno''{{'s}} elliptical orbit and the Jovian radiation belts]]

''Juno''{{'s}} highly elliptical initial polar orbit takes it within {{convert|4200|km|mi|sp=us}} of the planet and out to {{convert|8.1|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}}, far beyond [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]'s orbit. An [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]-reducing burn, called the Period Reduction Maneuver, was planned that would drop the probe into a much shorter 14 day science orbit.&lt;ref name="nasasf20160903"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/09/juno-closest-approach-jupiter-readies-for-primary-science-mission/ |title=Juno provides new data on Jupiter; readies for primary science mission |work=NASA Spaceflight |first=Chris |last=Gebhardt |date=September 3, 2016 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, ''Juno'' was expected to complete 37 orbits over 20 months before the end of its mission. Due to problems with helium valves that are important during main engine burns, mission managers announced on February 17, 2017, that ''Juno'' would remain in its original 53-day orbit, since the chance of an engine misfire putting the spacecraft into a bad orbit was too high.&lt;ref name="nasa20170217" /&gt; ''Juno'' will now complete only 12 science orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan, ending July 2018.&lt;ref name="sfnow20170221"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2017/02/21/nasas-juno-spacecraft-to-remain-in-current-orbit-around-jupiter/ |title=NASA's Juno spacecraft to remain in current orbit around Jupiter |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=February 21, 2017 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbits were carefully planned in order to minimize contact with Jupiter's dense [[magnetosphere of Jupiter|radiation belt]]s, which can damage spacecraft electronics and solar panels, by exploiting a gap in the radiation envelope near the planet, passing through a region of minimal radiation.&lt;ref name="JunoMission"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spaced"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Juno_Gets_A_Little_Bigger_With_One_More_Payload_For_Jovian_Delivery_999.html |title=Juno Gets A Little Bigger With One More Payload For Jovian Delivery |work=Space Daily |last=Moomaw |first=Bruce |date=March 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Juno Radiation Vault]]", with 1-centimeter-thick [[titanium]] walls, also aids in protecting Juno's electronics.&lt;ref name="armored-up"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2010-230 |title=Juno Armored Up to Go to Jupiter |accessdate=July 11, 2016 |date=July 12, 2010 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the intense radiation, JunoCam and the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) are expected to endure at least eight orbits, while the Microwave Radiometer (MWR) should endure at least eleven orbits.&lt;ref name="HomeOrbit"&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Juno's Orbit: An Interview with NASA's Scott Bolton |url=http://www.universetoday.com/123711/understanding-junos-orbit-interview-nasas-scott-bolton/ |website=Universe Today |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Juno'' will receive much lower levels of radiation in its polar orbit than the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' orbiter]] received in its equatorial orbit.

Although the mission's lifetime is inherently limited by radiation exposure, almost all of this dose was planned to be acquired during the perijoves. {{asof|2017}}, the 53.4 day orbit was planned to be maintained through July 2018 for a total of twelve science-gathering perijoves. At the end of this prime mission, the project was planned to go through a science review process by NASA's Planetary Science Division to determine if it will receive funding for an extended mission.&lt;ref name="nasa20170217" /&gt;

In June 2018, NASA extended the mission operations plan to July 2021.&lt;ref name=nasa20180606&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-re-plans-juno-s-jupiter-mission NASA Re-plans Juno’s Jupiter Mission]. NASA News. June 6, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Juno'' reaches the end of the mission, it will perform a controlled deorbit and disintegrate into Jupiter's atmosphere. During the mission, the spacecraft will be exposed to high levels of radiation from [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|Jupiter's magnetosphere]], which may cause future failure of certain instruments and risk collision with Jupiter's moons.&lt;ref name=skytel20170221/&gt;&lt;ref name=insider20160705/&gt;

*Obtain a better estimate of Jupiter's core mass, which will also help distinguish among prevailing theories linking Jupiter's formation to the Solar System.
*Precisely map Jupiter's [[gravity|gravitational]] field to assess the distribution of mass in Jupiter's interior, including properties of its structure and dynamics.
*Precisely map Jupiter's [[magnetic field]] to assess the origin and structure of the field and how deep in Jupiter the magnetic field is created. This experiment will also help scientists understand the fundamental physics of [[dynamo theory]].
*Map the variation in atmospheric composition, temperature, structure, cloud opacity and dynamics to pressures far greater than {{convert|100|bar|MPa psi|-1|lk=on|abbr=out}} at all latitudes.

== Operational components ==

=== Solar panels ===
[[File:Illumination test on one of Juno's solar panels.jpg|thumb|Illumination test on one of ''Juno''{{'s}} solar panels]]

''Juno'' is the first mission to Jupiter to use [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] instead of the [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTG) used by ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', the [[Voyager program]], ''[[Ulysses spacecraft|Ulysses]]'', ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'', ''[[New Horizons]]'', and the [[Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'' orbiter]]. It is also the farthest solar-powered trip in the history of space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA's Juno Mission to Jupiter to Be Farthest Solar-Powered Trip |url=http://www.space.com/12541-juno-jupiter-mission-solar-panels-power.html |accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in orbit around Jupiter, ''Juno'' receives only 4% as much sunlight as it would on Earth, but the global shortage of [[Plutonium-238#United States supply|plutonium-238]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Dickinson |title=US to restart plutonium production for deep space exploration |url=http://phys.org/news/2013-03-restart-plutonium-production-deep-space.html |publisher=Universe Today |date=March 21, 2013 |accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenfieldboyce |first=Nell |title=Plutonium Shortage Could Stall Space Exploration |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113223613 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenfieldboyce |first=Nell |title=The Plutonium Problem: Who Pays For Space Fuel? |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/08/141931325/the-plutonium-problem-who-pays-for-space-fuel |publisher=NPR |accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Plutonium Production May Avert Spacecraft Fuel Shortage |url=http://www.space.com/15184-plutonium238-spacecraft-fuel-production.html |accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as advances made in solar cell technology over the past several decades, makes it economically preferable to use solar panels of practical size to provide power at a distance of 5 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the [[Sun]].

The ''Juno'' spacecraft uses three solar panels symmetrically arranged around the spacecraft. Shortly after it cleared Earth's atmosphere, the panels were deployed. Two of the panels have four hinged segments each, and the third panel has three segments and a [[magnetometer]]. Each panel is {{convert|2.7|by|8.9|m|ft|sp=us}} long,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/news/juno20110527.html |title=Juno Solar Panels Complete Testing |first=NASA |last=Administrator |date=June 24, 2016 |publisher= |accessdate=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the biggest on any NASA deep-space probe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/news/juno20110805.html NASA's Juno Spacecraft Launches to Jupiter] "... and that its massive solar arrays, the biggest on any NASA deep-space probe, have deployed and are generating power."&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined mass of the three panels is nearly {{convert|340|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa-usa.de/mission_pages/juno/launch/Juno_solarpower.html |title=Juno's Solar Cells Ready to Light Up Jupiter Mission |accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the panels were optimized to operate at Earth, they would produce 12 to 14 kilowatts of power.  Only about 486&amp;nbsp;W was generated when ''Juno'' arrived at Jupiter, projected to decline to near 420&amp;nbsp;W as radiation degrades the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://machinedesign.com/article/juno-prepares-for-mission-to-jupiter-1104 |title=Juno prepares for mission to Jupiter |publisher=[[Machine Design]] |accessdate=November 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031152907/http://machinedesign.com/article/juno-prepares-for-mission-to-jupiter-1104 |archivedate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solar panels will remain in sunlight continuously from launch through the end of the mission, except for short periods during the operation of the main engine and eclipses by Jupiter. A central power distribution and drive unit monitors the power that is generated by the solar panels and distributes it to instruments, heaters, and experiment sensors, as well as to batteries that are charged when excess power is available. Two 55-amp-hour [[lithium-ion]] batteries that are able to withstand the radiation environment of Jupiter provide power when ''Juno'' passes through eclipse.&lt;ref name="Spaceflight 101"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflight101.com/juno-spacecraft-information.html |title=Juno Spacecraft Information – Power Distribution |accessdate=August 6, 2011 |year=2011 |work=Spaceflight 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunications ===
[[File:Juno's high-gain antenna just before installation.jpg|thumb|''Juno''{{'s}} high-gain antenna dish being installed]]
''Juno'' uses [[in-band signaling]] ("tones") for several critical operations as well as status reporting during cruise mode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key Terms |at=Section TONES |work=Mission Juno |publisher=Southwest Research Institute |url=https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/key-terms/#tones |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505170851/https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/key-terms/ |archivedate=May 5, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is expected to be used infrequently. Communications are via the {{convert|34|m|ft|adj=on}} and {{convert|70|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s of the [[NASA Deep Space Network]] (DSN) utilizing an [[X band]] direct link.&lt;ref name='Spaceflight 101'/&gt; The command and data processing of the ''Juno'' spacecraft includes a flight computer capable of providing about 50 Mbit/s of instrument throughput. Gravity science subsystems use the X-band and [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-band]] [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] tracking and autoranging.

Due to telecommunications constraints, ''Juno'' will only be able to return about 40 megabytes of JunoCam data during each 11-day orbital period, limiting the number of images that are captured and transmitted during each orbit to somewhere between 10 and 100 depending on the compression level used.&lt;ref name="planetary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2011/3133.html |title=Junocam will get us great global shots down onto Jupiter's poles |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall amount of data downlinked on each orbit is significantly higher and used for the mission's scientific instruments; JunoCam is intended for public outreach and is thus secondary to the science data. This is comparable to the previous [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' mission]] that orbited Jupiter, which captured thousands of images&lt;ref name="galileoimages"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/gallery/index.cfm |title=Images |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite its slow data rate of 1000 bit/s (at maximum compression level) due to the [[Galileo (spacecraft)#Main antenna problem|failure of its high-gain antenna]].

The communication system is also used as part of the [[Gravity Science (Juno)|Gravity Science]] experiment.

=== Propulsion ===
''Juno'' uses a [[LEROS|LEROS 1b]] main engine with [[hypergolic propellant]], manufactured by [[Moog Inc]] in [[Westcott, Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |title=Juno Jupiter probe gets British boost |date=September 4, 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19477618 |work=BBC News |accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses [[hydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] for propulsion and provides a thrust of 645 [[newton (unit)|newton]]s. The engine bell is enclosed in a debris shield fixed to the spacecraft body, and is used for major burns. For control of the vehicle's orientation ([[attitude control]]) and to perform trajectory correction maneuvers, ''Juno'' utilizes a [[monopropellant]] [[reaction control system]] (RCS) consisting of twelve small thrusters that are mounted on four engine modules.&lt;ref name='Spaceflight 101'/&gt;

== Galileo plaque and minifigures ==
[[File:Galileo plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Galileo plaque]]
''Juno'' carries a plaque to Jupiter, dedicated to [[Galileo Galilei]]. The plaque was provided by the [[Italian Space Agency]] and measures {{convert|7.1|by|5.1|cm|in|sp=us}}. It is made of flight-grade aluminum and weighs {{convert|6|g|oz}}.&lt;ref name="plaque"&gt;{{cite web |title=Juno Jupiter Mission to Carry Plaque Dedicated to Galileo |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/news/galileo20110803.html |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque depicts a portrait of Galileo and a text in Galileo's own handwriting, penned in January 1610, while observing what would later be known to be the [[Galilean moons]].&lt;ref name="plaque" /&gt; The text translates as:

{{quote|On the 11th it was in this formation - and the star closest to Jupiter was half the size than the other and very close to the other so that during the previous nights all of the three observed stars looked of the same dimension and among them equally afar; so that it is evident that around Jupiter there are three moving stars invisible till this time to everyone.}}

The spacecraft also carries three [[Lego minifigure]]s representing Galileo, the Roman god Jupiter, and his sister and wife, the goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. In Roman mythology, Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief. Juno was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. The Juno minifigure holds a magnifying glass as a sign of searching for the truth, and Jupiter holds a lightning bolt. The third Lego crew member, Galileo Galilei, has his telescope with him on the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Juno'' Spacecraft to Carry Three Lego minifigures to Jupiter Orbit |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/news/lego20110803.html |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figurines were produced in partnership between NASA and Lego as part of an outreach program to inspire children's interest in [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM).&lt;ref name="nasa20110803"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/news/lego20110803.html |title=Juno Spacecraft to Carry Three Figurines to Jupiter Orbit |publisher=NASA |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most Lego toys are made of plastic, Lego specially made these minifigures of aluminum to endure the extreme conditions of space flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2390527,00.asp |title=Jupiter Probe Successfully Launches With Lego On Board |work=PC Magazine |first=Peter |last=Pachal |date=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leo Cluster''' ([[List of Abell clusters|Abell]] 1367) is a [[galaxy cluster]] about 330 million [[light-year]]s distant ([[Redshift|z]] = 0.022&lt;ref name="NED"/&gt;) in the [[constellation]] Leo, with at least 70 major galaxies. The galaxy known as [[NGC 3842]] is the brightest member of this cluster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Along with the [[Coma Cluster]], it is one of the two major clusters comprising the [[Coma Supercluster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/com.html|title=The Coma Supercluster|website=www.atlasoftheuniverse.com|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is part of the [[CfA2 Great Wall]], which is hundreds of millions light years long and is one of the largest known structures in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webbdeepsky.com/galaxies/object?object=NGC3842|title=Webb Deep-Sky Society: Galaxy of the Month: NGC3842|website=www.webbdeepsky.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A team of scientists decided to observe the Leo Cluster with the intention of creating a catalog of extended ionized gas clouds, or EIGs. This data also led to the discovery of many star-forming parents (galaxies) within the cluster. These star-forming galaxies turned out to be very similar to those found in the neighboring Coma cluster. The EIGs in the Leo cluster, however, turned out to be longer in the Leo cluster compared to the Coma cluster. This likely means that the Leo cluster and its stars are probably younger than most comparable clusters in the universe and evolve at a different pace. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yagi|first=Masafumi|last2=Yoshida|first2=Michitoshi|last3=Gavazzi|first3=Giuseppe|last4=Komiyama|first4=Yutaka|last5=Kashikawa|first5=Nobunari|last6=Sadanori Okamura|date=2017|title=Extended Ionized Gas Clouds in the Abell 1367 Cluster|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/839/i=1/a=65|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=839|issue=1|pages=65|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/aa68e3|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1703.10301|bibcode=2017ApJ...839...65Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most dense galaxy clusters are composed mostly of elliptical galaxies. The Leo Cluster, however, mostly contains spiral galaxies, suggesting that it is much younger than other comparable clusters, such as the [[Coma Cluster]]. It is also home to one of the universe's largest known black holes, which lies in the center of [[NGC 3842]]. The black hole is 9.7 billion times more massive than our sun. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/are-you-ready-willing-and-abell/|title=Are You Ready, Willing, and Abell? - Sky &amp; Telescope|date=2017-04-26|work=Sky &amp; Telescope|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It can be very difficult for stars to form within the Leo Cluster. This is because infalling galaxies have a tendency to strip gas away from other stars that are attempting to form. This has led to the creation of a "hot zone" where stars are unable to maintain their gas long enough to properly form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beskeen.com/gallery/galaxy/abell1367/abell1367.shtml|title=Abell 1367 - The Leo Galaxy Cluster|website=www.beskeen.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There appears to be a number of subpopulations within the Leo Cluster. The first consists of elliptical galaxies that seem to be roughly as old as the universe. The second subpopulation contains red-sequence lenticular (lens shaped) galaxies whose ages are directly tied to their mass. The third and final subpopulation is of galaxies where star formation is still taking place,and are morphologically distributed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouhcine|first=M.|last2=Kriwattanawong|first2=W.|last3=James|first3=P.

'''Lighthouse Labs''' is a [[coding bootcamp]] for [[web development|web]] and mobile software development in multiple cities across [[Canada]]. The establishment organizes an annual free learn-to-code event, [[The HTML500]], in partnership with [[Telus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/01/26/html500-vancouver_n_6542302.html|title=The HTML500 Bootcamp Teaches Free Coding To Promote Digital Literacy|date= 25 Jan 2015|website=huffingtonpost.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the bootcamp became the first organization to offer a remote-hybrid [[web development]] program in [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] through a partnership with the Government of [[Yukon]].&lt;ref name="gov.yk.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.yk.ca/news/15-189.html#.VXc4E1xVhHw|title=Coding boot camp trains future Yukon web developers|date= 27 May 2015|website=gov.yk.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==

===Vancouver===
Opened in 2013, Lighthouse Labs' first immersive bootcamp facility is based out of Launch Academy, an [[Business Incubator|incubator]] in the heart of the city's [[Gastown]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://betakit.com/new-vancouver-based-coding-academy-lighthouse-labs-to-launch-this-fall/ |title=New Vancouver-Based Coding Academy to launch this fall|author=Joseph Czikk |date= 3 September 2013|website=betakit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students learn front and back-end development through the bootcamp's Web and iOS programs.&lt;ref name="VanCity Buzz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2015/04/lighthouse-labs-vancouver-coding-bootcamp/|title=A new coding bootcamp is filling the talent gap in Vancouver|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The iOS program, launched in July 2014, is arguably Canada's first immersive iOS immersive program.&lt;ref name="Tech Vibes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/lighthouse-labs-launches-ios-bootcamp-2014-04-14|title=Vancouver's Lighthouse Labs Launches Canada's First iOS Bootcamp Course|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toronto===
As part of a national partnership with Highline, a seed stage investment platform, Lighthouse Labs announced the launch of its Toronto operations during [[The HTML500]] in February 2015.&lt;ref name="Toronto Is Awesome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontoisawesome.com/lifestyle/torontos-newest-tech-bootcamp-will-change-your-career-forever/ |title=Toronto’s Newest Tech Bootcamp Will Change Your Career Forever |accessdate=2015-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516161031/http://www.torontoisawesome.com/lifestyle/torontos-newest-tech-bootcamp-will-change-your-career-forever |archivedate=2015-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in Highline's office in downtown Toronto, the facility offers enrollment in any of the bootcamp's full-time or part-time programs. It joins existing Toronto-based bootcamps such as Bitmaker Labs, BrainStation, HackerYou, and Red Academy as one of several developer bootcamps that offer in-person learning opportunities to individuals in the [[Greater Toronto Area]].&lt;ref name="HackerYou"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hackeryou.com/learn-to-code-in-2015-a-list-of-torontos-in-person-learning-opportunities/|title=Learn to Code in 2015: A List of Toronto’s In-Person Learning Opportunities|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calgary===
In April 2015, Lighthouse Labs launched a 'pop-up' program in Calgary through its national partnership with Highline, a co-venture platform that helps early stage digital startups. Lighthouse Labs in Calgary currently offers students the opportunity to enroll in a 6-week part-time program focused primarily on learning the fundamentals of web development.&lt;ref name="HIGHLINE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highline.vc/articles/highline-lighthouse-labs/|title=National Partnership with Highline|accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lighthouse Labs Calgary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lighthouselabs.ca/calgary|title=Lighthouse Labs Calgary|accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whitehorse===
In partnership with the Government of [[Yukon]], Lighthouse Labs launched the territory's first web development bootcamp via a remote-hybrid program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukoners-brave-intense-eight-week-coding-camp-1.3088670 |title=Yukoners brave intense eight-week 'coding camp'|date= 25 Feb 2015|website=cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students remotely attend lectures from the bootcamp's Vancouver location and have access to on-site assistance through Mentors in the facility &lt;ref name="gov.yk.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.biv.com/article/2015/5/hybrid-coding-boot-camp-aims-bring-global-tech-sec/|title=‘Hybrid’ coding boot camp aims to bring tech sector to rural Canada|date= 4 May 2015|website=www.biv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarships ==

=== Simon Fraser University ===
The 'Lighthouse Labs Prize' is an annual scholarship open to students of [[Simon Fraser University]]'s [[The Faculty of Communication, Art and Technology at Simon Fraser University|Faculty of Communication, Art &amp; Technology]]. Worth over $7000, the scholarship awards one student a spot in the bootcamp's web-development program in Vancouver and is currently in its second year of institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/fcat/blog/spring-2015/lighthouse-labs-prize-.html|title=Apply Today to Earn a Spot in Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp|date=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is  list of '''Mars analogs''', which simulate aspects of the conditions human beings could experience during a future mission to [[Mars]], or different aspects of Mars such as its materials or conditions. This is often used for testing aspects of spacecraft missions to that planet

;Crew analog experiments
[[File:ConcordiaFromTower.jpg|360px|thumb|Concordia Research Station at Dome Charlie. Concordia station is a Franco-Italia effort that replicates certain aspects of the human Mars mission and supports the ESA Aurora program.&lt;ref name="esa.int"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Research/Mission_to_Mars_via_Antarctica Mission to Mars via Antarctica 21 December 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:FMARS Crew 3 at Marine Rock 2001-07-20.jpg|thumb|Crew for a Mars research mission practice techniques on [[Devon Island]], in the Canadian arctic]]

Some examples of analog tests with people include NASA conducting a 120-day study in Hawaii to test a space food diet (HI-SEAS),&lt;ref name=hiseas/&gt; and equipment tests inside Austrian mountain caves in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,831024,00.html Christoph Seidler – '''Austrian Cave Sets Stage for Red Planet Voyage''' (2012) – Der Spiegel]&lt;/ref&gt; A future Mars base has been compared to the  [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] in Antarctica, because relatively small groups must survive in extreme conditions there.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://scienceillustrated.com.au/blog/science/a-new-era/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mars analogs are sometimes chosen for their location, for example, [[Devon Island]] is at 75°N latitude which provides solar radiance similar to the Martian Equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tomatosphere.org/teachers/guide/grades-8-10/mars-agriculture |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623152330/http://tomatosphere.org/teachers/guide/grades-8-10/mars-agriculture |archivedate=2015-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, high altitudes can provide an equivalent to the low pressure of the Mars atmosphere

Mars regolith has been attempted to be replicated by [[Mars regolith simulant]]

Among these are:
*[[Mars-500]], simulated a 520-day mission in Moscow.
*[[Mars Analogue Research Station Program]], simulated Mars habitats
**[[Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station]]
**[[Mars Desert Research Station]]
**[[European Mars Analog Research Station]]

At about 28 miles (45&amp;nbsp;km,  150 thousand feet ) Earth altitude the pressure starts to be equivalent to Mars surface pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/barfor.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the major component of Mars air, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, is denser than Earth air for a given pressure.&lt;ref name=morton&gt;[http://quest.nasa.gov/aero/planetary/MarsAir.html Oliver Morton – MarsAir How to build the first extraterrestrial airplane. – NASA Quest]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps more significantly there is no land at this altitude on earth. The highest point on earth is the summit of [[Mount Everest]] at about 5.5 miles (8.8&amp;nbsp;km,  29 thousand feet), where the pressure is about fifty times greater than on the surface of Mars. The correct atmospheric pressure can be created by a [[vacuum chamber]]. [[NASA]]'s [[Space_Power_Facility#Thermal-Vacuum_Test_Chamber|Space Power Facility]] was used to test the airbag landing systems for the [[Mars Pathfinder]] and the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, Spirit and Opportunity, under simulated Mars atmospheric conditions.

;Gravity
The gravity of Mars is about 38% of Earth's gravity at the surface,&lt;ReF&gt;[http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/73-How-strong-is-the-gravity-on-Mars-]&lt;/ref&gt; about 3.7 meters per second&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ReF&gt;[https://www.universetoday.com/14859/gravity-on-mars/]&lt;/reF&gt; This can be simulated for short time by an aircraft following a flight profile that causes this type of acceleration.&lt;reF&gt;[http://www.nature.com/articles/31374]&lt;/reF&gt; This technique (using a variation on free-fall) has allowed the gait of people in Mars gravity to be studied.&lt;reF&gt;[http://www.nature.com/articles/31374]&lt;/reF&gt;

==20th century==
The Russians conducted the [[BIOS-3]] study in the 60s and 70s which had 315 cubic meters of space, and a later confinement study was [[Mars 500]].&lt;ReF&gt;[http://scienceillustrated.com.au/blog/in-the-mag/dreaming-of-mars-part-1/]&lt;/reF&gt;

[[File:LBolk.jpg|thumb|Louis Bolk.]]  
'''Lodewijk 'Louis' Bolk''' (December 10, 1866, [[Rotterdam|Overschie]] &amp;ndash; June 17, 1930, [[Amsterdam]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Anatomy|anatomist]] who created the [[fetalization theory]] about the human body. It states that when a human being is born, it is still a [[fetus]], as can be seen if one pays attention to its (proportionally) big head, to its uncoordinated motility or to its absolute helplessness, for instance. Furthermore, this "[[prematuration]]" is specifically human.

[[Gavin de Beer]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] wrote about him and further developed this theory, which is sometimes called [[neoteny]]. 

Also [[Jacques Lacan]] took Bolk's fetalization theory into account in order to introduce his own thesis on the [[mirror stage]].

The '''Madagascar sucker-footed bat''', '''Old World sucker-footed bat''', or simply '''sucker-footed bat''' (''Myzopoda aurita'') is a species of [[bat]] in the family [[Myzopodidae]] [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Madagascar]], especially in the eastern part of the forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=H.|first=Schliemann|author2=Goodman, S.M.|title=''Myzopoda aurita'', Old World sucker-footed bat|journal=The natural history of Madagascar|year=2003|pages=1303–1306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genus was thought to be monospecific until a second species, ''[[Myzopoda schliemanni]]'', was discovered in the central western lowlands.&lt;ref name=Goodman2006&gt;{{cite journal |author= Goodman, S.M. |author2=Rakotondraparany, F. |author3=Kofoky, A.|title=The description of a new species of ''Myzopoda'' (Myzopodidae: Chiroptera) from western Madagascar|journal=Mammalian Biology |year=2006 |volume=72 |pages=65–81 |doi=10.1016/j.mambio.2006.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was classified as Vulnerable in the 1996 [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] but is now known to be more abundant and was reclassified in 2008 as of "[[Least Concern]]".&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

The bat is named for the presence of small cups on its wrists and ankles. They roost inside the rolled leaves of the [[Ravenala madagascariensis|traveller's tree]],&lt;ref name=Ralisata2010/&gt; using their suckers to attach themselves to the smooth surface.&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 807|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the name, it is now known that the bats do not use [[suction]] to attach themselves to roost sites, but instead use a form of [[Arboreal locomotion#Adhesions|wet adhesion]] by secreting a body fluid at their pads.&lt;ref name=bun1&gt;Brown University News, December 2009,  [http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2009/12/myzopoda|Sucker-Footed Bats Don’t Use Suction After All]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice Cossmann''', full name '''Alexandre Édouard Maurice Cossmann''' (18 September 1850 – 17 May 1924) was a French [[paleontologist]] and [[malacologist]].

Maurice Cossmann's father was an artist draughtsman and a talented lithographer. His early education was at [[Lycée Condorcet|Condorcet College]] in Paris and he later gained the Diploma of the [[École centrale Paris|Central School of Arts and Manufacturing]] in the same city. He was then employed by the [[Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord]]. Cossmann made all his career there, finally as Chief of the Engineering services (Ingénieur Chef des Services Techniques). Married and without a child, he loved to tell how the  arrival of a small collection of fossils had led to his future studies of paleontology. Cossman specialised in the fossils of the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] periods. Certain of his works are still a major reference especially:
*''Iconographie complète des coquilles fossiles de l'Éocène des environs de Paris'', in English Iconography of the fossil shells of the [[Eocene]] of the Paris basin) written with [[G. Pissaro]] (1904–1913, ca. 3000 pages and 110 plates) and
*''Conchyliologie néogénique de l’Aquitaine'' in English [[Neogene]] Conchology of [[Aquitaine]] with [[A. Peyrot]] (in Actes de la Société Linnéenne de Bordeaux, 1909–1932, vol. 45–85, ca. 4500 pages and 121 plates).

Cossman published, sometimes collaboratively, 186 works (scientific papers and monographs) between 1879 and 1926 and he was the Editor of ''Revue critique de paléozoologie et de paléophytologie'' Paris 1897&amp;ndash;1919. His work is described in two obituaries written by G.F.Dollfus in 1925 and A.R.Kabat in 1989.

Garcia-Moreno, and R. Sastre, Long-pulse narrow-linewidth disperse solid-state dye laser oscillator, ''Appl. Opt.'' '''37''', 3987–3989 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The grating in this particular oscillator is deployed in Littrow configuration.]]

==Excitation==

Multiple-prism grating laser oscillators can be excited either electrically, as in the case of gas lasers and semiconductor lasers,&lt;ref name="TLO"&gt;[http://www.tunablelaseroptics.com F. J. Duarte, ''Tunable Laser Optics'', 2nd Ed. (CRC, New York, 2015)].&lt;/ref&gt; or optically, as in the case of crystalline lasers and organic dye lasers.&lt;ref name="DLP"/&gt;  In the case of optical excitation it is often necessary to match the polarization of the excitation laser to the polarization preference of the multiple-prism grating oscillator.&lt;ref name="DLP"/&gt;  This can be done using a [[polarization rotator]] thus improving the laser conversion efficiency.&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;

==Linewidth performance==

The [[multiple-prism dispersion theory]] is applied to design these beam expanders either in additive configuration, thus adding or subtracting  their dispersion to the dispersion of the grating, or in compensating configuration (yielding zero dispersion at a design wavelength) thus allowing the diffraction grating to control the tuning characteristics of the laser cavity.&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt; Under those conditions, that is, zero dispersion from the multiple-prism beam expander, the single-pass [[laser linewidth]] is given by&lt;ref name="DLP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\lambda \approx \Delta \theta \left(M {\partial\theta\over\partial\lambda}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the beam divergence and ''M'' is the beam magnification provided by the beam expander that multiplies the angular dispersion provided by the diffraction grating.  In the case of multiple-prism beam expanders this factor can be as high as 100-200.&lt;ref name="DLP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;

When the dispersion of the multiple-prism expander is not equal to zero, then the single-pass linewidth is given by&lt;ref name="DLP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\lambda \approx \Delta \theta \left(M {\partial\theta\over\partial\lambda} + {\partial\phi_{2,m}\over\partial\lambda} \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where the first differential refers to the angular dispersion from the grating and the second differential refers to the overall [[multiple-prism dispersion theory|dispersion from the multiple-prism beam expander]].&lt;ref name="DLP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;

Optimized solid-state multiple-prism grating laser oscillators have been shown, by [[F. J. Duarte|Duarte]], to generate pulsed single-longitudinal-mode emission limited only by [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name=FJD1999&gt;F. J. Duarte, Multiple-prism grating solid-state dye laser oscillator: optimized architecture, ''Appl. Opt.'' '''38''', 6347-6349 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[laser linewidth]] in these experiments is reported as &lt;math&gt;\Delta \nu&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 350&amp;nbsp;MHz (or &lt;math&gt;\Delta \lambda&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 0.0004&amp;nbsp;nm at 590&amp;nbsp;nm) in pulses ~ 3 ns wide, at power levels in the kW regime.&lt;ref name=FJD1999/&gt;

==Applications==
Applications of these tunable narrow-linewidth lasers include:

The '''Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer''' ('''NICMOS''') is a [[Measuring instrument|scientific instrument]] for [[infrared astronomy]], installed on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST), operating from 1997 to 1999, and from 2002 to 2008. Images produced by NICMOS contain data from the near-infrared part of the light spectrum.

NICMOS was conceived and designed by the NICMOS Instrument Definition Team centered at [[Steward Observatory]], [[University of Arizona]], USA. NICMOS is an imager and spectrometer built by [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp.]] that allows the HST to observe [[infrared light]], with [[wavelength]]s between 0.8 and 2.4 micrometers, providing imaging and slitless spectrophotometric capabilities. NICMOS contains three near-infrared detectors in three optical channels providing high (~ 0.1 arcsecond) resolution, coronagraphic and polarimetric imaging, and slitless spectroscopy in 11-, 19-, and 52-arcsecond square fields of view.  Each optical channel contains a 256×256 pixel photodiode array of [[mercury cadmium telluride]] [[infrared detector]]s bonded to a sapphire substrate, read out in four independent 128×128 quadrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Chris J. |last1=Skinner|first2= Louis E. |display-authors=4 |last2=Bergeron |first3=Alfred B. |last3=Schultz |first4=John W. |last4=MacKenty|first5= A. |last5=Storrs|first6= Wolfram |last6=Freudling|first7= D. |last7=Axon|first8= Howard A. |last8=Bushouse|first9= Daniela |last9=Calzetti|first10= L. |last10=Colina|first11= D. |last11=Daou|first12= D. |last12=Gilmore|first13= Sherie T. |last13=Holfeltz|first14= Joan |last14=Najita|first15= Keith |last15=Noll|first16= Christine E. |last16=Ritchie|first17= William B. |last17=Sparks |first18=A. |last18=Suchkov|title=On-orbit properties of the NICMOS detectors on HST|journal=Proc.

NICMOS last worked in 2008, and has been largely replaced by the infrared channel of [[Wide Field Camera 3]] after its installation in 2009.

==Limitations==

The infrared performance of the Hubble has limitations since it was not designed with infrared performance as an objective. For example, the mirror is kept at a stable and relatively high temperature (15&amp;nbsp;°C) by heaters.

&lt;blockquote&gt;HST is a warm telescope. The IR background flux collected by cooled focal plane IR instruments like NICMOS or WFC3 is dominated, at rather short wavelengths, by telescope thermal emission rather than by zodiacal scattering. NICMOS data show that the telescope background exceeds the zodiacal background at wavelengths longer than λ ≈ 1.6μm, the exact value depending on the pointing on the sky and on the position of the Earth on its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Performance of HST as an Infrared Telescope |last1=Robberto|first1= M.|display-authors= 4|last2= Sivaramakrishnan|first2= A.|last3= Bacinski|first3= J.J.|last4= Calzetti|first4= D.|last5= Krist|first5= J.E.|last6= MacKenty|first6= J.W.|last7= Piquero|first7= J. |last8= Stiavelli|first8= M. |url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/published/spie4013386.pdf  |format=PDF|journal=Proc. SPIE |volume=4013 |pages=386–393 |date=2000 |doi=10.1117/12.394037 |series=UV, Optical, and IR Space Telescopes and Instruments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, the combination of Hubble's mirror and NICMOS offered never-before seen levels of quality in near-infrared performance at that time.&lt;ref name="spaceflightnow.com"&gt;[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0206/06nicmos/]&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated infrared telescopes like the [[Infrared Space Observatory]] were ground-breaking in their own way, but had a smaller primary mirror, and were also out of service at the time of NICMOS installation because they ran out of coolant. NICMOS later overcame this problem by using a machine chiller like a refrigerator, which allowed it operate for years until it went offline in 2008

==History of NICMOS==

NICMOS was installed on Hubble during its second servicing mission in 1997 ([[STS-82]]) along with the [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]], replacing two earlier instruments.  NICMOS in turn has been largely superseded by the [[Wide Field Camera 3]], which has a much larger field of view (135 by 127 arcsec, or 2.3 by 2.1 arcminutes), and reaches almost as far into the infrared. 
[[File:STS-82 crew.jpg|thumb|NICMOS was installed by the crew of STS-82, this [[Space Shuttle]] mission in 1997 also installed the STIS instrument on Hubble Space Telescope, a scale model of the telescope is shown with this crew photo]]

[[File:STS082-323-017.jpg|thumb|Shuttle crew EVA with Hubble Space Telescope]]
When conducting infrared measurements, it is necessary to keep the infrared detectors cooled to avoid having infrared interference from the instrument's own thermal emissions. NICMOS contains a cryogenic [[Dewar flask|dewar]], that cooled its detectors to about 61&amp;nbsp;K, and optical filters to ~ 105&amp;nbsp;K, with a block of [[solid nitrogen]] ice. When NICMOS was installed in 1997, the [[dewar flask]] contained a 230-pound (104&amp;nbsp;kg) block of nitrogen ice. Due to a thermal short that arose on March 4, 1997, during the instrument commissioning, the dewar ran out of [[nitrogen]] coolant sooner than expected in January 1999.

A new software upload in September 2008 necessitated a brief shutdown of the NICMOS cooling system.  Several attempts to restart the cooling system were unsuccessful due to issues with the cryogenic circulator. After waiting more than six weeks for parts of the instrument to warm up, and theorized ice particles to sublimate from the neon circulating loop, the cooler once again failed to restart. An Anomaly Review Board (ARB) was then convened by NASA. The ARB concluded that ice or other solid particle migrated from the dewar to the circulator during the September 2008 restart attempt and that the circulator may be damaged, and determined an alternative set of startup parameters.  A successful restart at 13:30 EST on 16 December 2008 led to four days of cooler operations followed by another shutdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/nicmos/newsItems/Nicmosncs_status_01232009|title=NICMOS/NCS Status|date=January 23, 2009|publisher=[[Space Telescope Science Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2009, the cooler was restarted again;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble Space Telescope Status Report|date=August 5, 2009|publisher=[[NASA]]|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/SM4/news/HST_update_5Aug2009.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; NICMOS was expected to resume operations in mid-February 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NICMOS Late Breaking News Page|date=December 16, 2009|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/nicmos/localNews?display_type=all#NICMOS_NCS_status_12162009}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and operated through October 22, 2009, at which point a lock-up of Hubble's data handling system caused the telescope to shut down.  The circulation flow rate to NICMOS was greatly reduced during this operating period confirming blockage in the circulation loop.  Continued operation at reduced flow rates would limit NICMOS science so plans for purging and refilling the circulation system with clean neon gas were developed by NASA.  The circulation loop is equipped with an extra neon tank and remotely operated solenoid valves for on-orbit purge-fill operations.  As of 2013, these purge-fill operations have not yet been performed.

On June 18, 2010, it was announced NICMOS would not be available for science during the latest proposal Cycle 18.  As of 2013, a decision as to whether the purge-fill operations will be performed and whether NICMOS will be available for science in the future has not been made.

NICMOS is also the name of the devices's 256×256-pixel imaging sensor built by Rockwell International Electro-Optical Center (now DRS Technologies).

==Scientific results==

NICMOS was noted for its performance in Near-infrared space astronomy, in particular its ability to see objects through dust.&lt;ref name="spaceflightnow.com"/&gt; It was used for about 23 months after it was installed, its life limited by set amount of cryo-coolant, and then later it was used for several years when a new cyro-cooler was installed in 2002.&lt;ref name="spaceflightnow.com"/&gt; NICMOS combined near infrared performance with a large mirror.&lt;ref name="spaceflightnow.com"/&gt;

NICMOS allowed investigation of high [[redshift]] galaxies and QSO with high spatial resolution, which was especially useful when analyzed in conjunction with other instruments such as the STIS, and it also allowed deeper investigation of stellar populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cds.cern.ch/record/439513/files/0005495.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In planetary science, NICMOS was used to discover an impact basin on the bottom asteroid [[4 Vesta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oa289IxCvAAC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=discovered+with+nicmos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=szdqmjFens&amp;sig=96fouO_ShaIEGxB7YHvnENx6BoI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigpfDtjszQAhWF7iYKHTY-CrM4FBDoAQg2MAg#v=onepage&amp;q=discovered%20with%20nicmos&amp;f=falseAsteroids: Overview, Abstracts, and Bibliography By Edward C. Blair - Page 115] (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; (4 Vesta was later visited by [[Dawn (spacecraft)]] in the 2010s which investigated it more closely by orbiting it)

In 2009, an old NICMOS image was processed to show a predicted [[exoplanet]] around the star [[HR 8799]].&lt;ref name=exoplanets/&gt; The system is thought to be about 130 [[light-years]] from Earth.&lt;ref name=exoplanets/&gt;

In 2011, around that same star, four exoplanets were rendered viewable in a NICMOS image taken in 1998, using advanced data processing.&lt;ref name=exoplanets&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/elusive-planets.html NASA - Astronomers Find Elusive Planets in Decade-Old Hubble Data - 10.06.11]&lt;/ref&gt; The exoplanets were originally discovered with the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck telescopes]] and the [[Gemini North]] telescope between 2007 and 2010.&lt;ref name=exoplanets/&gt; The image allows the orbits of the exoplanets to be analyzed more closely, since they take many decades, even hundreds of Earth years, to orbit their host star.&lt;ref name=exoplanets/&gt;

NICMOS observed the exoplanet [[XO-2Nb|XO-2b]] at star [[XO-2 (star)|XO-2]], and a spectroscopy result was obtained for this exoplanet in 2012.&lt;ref name="cds.cern.ch"&gt;[http://cds.cern.ch/record/1489206]&lt;/ref&gt; This uses the spectroscopic abilities of the instrument, and in astronomy spectroscopy during a planetary transit (an exoplanet passes in front of star from the perspective of Earth) is a way to study that exoplanet's possible atmosphere.&lt;ref name="cds.cern.ch"/&gt;

In 2014, researchers recovered planetary discs in old NICMOS data using new image processing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/april/astronomical-forensics-uncover-planetary-disks-in-nasas-hubble-archive/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Human Nature''''' (1978; second edition 2004) is a book by Harvard biologist [[E. O. Wilson]], in which the author attempts to explain human nature and society through [[sociobiology]]. Wilson argues that evolution has left its traces on characteristics such as generosity, self-sacrifice, worship and the use of sex for pleasure, and proposes a sociobiological explanation of [[homosexuality]].{{sfn|Wilson|1995|page=143}} He attempts to complete the Darwinian revolution by bringing biological thought into social sciences and humanities. Wilson describes ''On Human Nature'' as a sequel to his earlier books ''The Insect Societies'' (1971) and ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' (1975).

The book won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1979.

==Summary==
Wilson writes that ''On Human Nature'' is the third of a trilogy, the previous volumes of which were ''The Insect Societies'' (1971) and ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis'' (1975), and that its thesis is that general sociobiology, "the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization", is the appropriate means of closing "the famous gap between the two cultures". He proposes that [[homosexuality]] may be "a distinctive beneficent behavior that evolved as an important element of early human social organization", describing it as "above all a form of bonding", possibly based on a genetic predisposition.{{sfn|Wilson|1995|pages=ix–x, 143–144}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
The biologist [[Jerry Coyne]], writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', accused Wilson of trying to use evolutionary psychology to control social science and social policy, arguing that ''On Human Nature'' was similar in this respect to Wilson's subsequent book ''[[Consilience (book)|Consilience]]'' (1998) and to the biologist [[Randy Thornhill]] and the anthropologist Craig Palmer's ''[[A Natural History of Rape]]'' (2000).{{sfn|Coyne|2000|pages=27–34}}

Bryan Walsh, writing in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 2011, named ''On Human Nature'' as one of the "100 best and most influential" books written in English since 1923. He considered Wilson's "real achievement" to be to "show how a sociobiological view of humanity could still have grandeur."{{sfn|Walsh|2011}} The computer scientist Paul Brown, writing in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' in 2018, stated that ''On Human Nature'' is "still brimful with ideas and insights about who we are, how we got here, and how to get wherever we want to go."{{sfn|Brown|2018|pages=58-59}}

===Academic journals===
''On Human Nature'' was discussed by Gregory Hanlon in the ''[[Journal of Interdisciplinary History]]''. Hanlon credited Wilson with helping to establish that human behavior could not be understood solely in terms of "learned cultural values", that the behavioral sciences could help to explain "the interpersonal actions in past societies." He compared the book to the ethnologist [[Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt]]'s ''[[Human Ethology (book)|Human Ethology]]'' (1989) and the historian [[Daniel Lord Smail]]'s ''Deep History and the Brain'' (2008).{{sfn|Hanlon|2009|pages=1–31}}

===Evaluations in books===
The anthropologist [[Sarah Blaffer Hrdy]], writing in ''The Woman That Never Evolved'' (1981), argued that a reading of the book refutes the accusation that Wilson aims to use sociobiology to reinforce traditional sex roles.{{sfn|Hrdy|1981|page=200}} The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], writing in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986), criticized Wilson's sociobiological explanations of human social behavior, arguing that because of Wilson's "polemical purpose" he was forced to oversimplify the facts. However, he granted that sociobiological explanations of the sort favored by Wilson might possibly be correct.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=185–186, 403}} The anthropologist [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald E. Brown]], writing in ''[[Human Universals]]'' (1991), commented that he at first failed to read Wilson's book because his views were still conditioned by the "sociocultural perspectives" in which he had been trained. However, Brown concluded that "sociobiologists might be more convincing if they confined their explanations to universals rather than attempting to show that virtually everything that humans do somehow maximizes their reproductive success."{{sfn|Brown|1991|page=viii}}

Science writers [[John Gribbin]] and Mary Gribbin, writing in ''Being Human'' (1993), described ''On Human Nature'' as an "accessible account of the application of sociobiology to people".{{sfn|Gribbin|Gribbin|1993|page=286}} The sociologist [[Ullica Segerstråle]], writing in ''Defenders of the Truth: The Battle for Science in the Sociobiology Debate and Beyond'' (2000), considered ''On Human Nature'' essentially a development of Wilson's earlier ideas. Segerstråle commented that, unlike opponents of sociobiology, Wilson saw it as having liberal political implications, and tried to develop these suggestions in ''On Human Nature''.{{sfn|Segerstråle|2000|pages=157, 377}} The psychologist [[David P. Barash]], writing with Ilona A. Barash in ''The Mammal in the Mirror: Understanding Our Place in the Natural World'' (2001), called ''On Human Nature'', "A wide-ranging, thoughtful, and controversial classic of human sociobiology".{{sfn|Barash|Barash|2001|page=362}}

'''Operation Moonwatch''' (also known as ''Project Moonwatch'' and, more simply, as ''Moonwatch'') was an [[citizen science|amateur science program]] formally initiated by the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO) in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-sihistory.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!1159!0 |title=Operation Moonwatch Begins |website=Siris-sihistory.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAO organized Moonwatch as part of the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) which was probably the largest single scientific undertaking in history. Its initial goal was to enlist the aid of amateur astronomers and other citizens who would help professional scientists [[Satellite watching|spot the first artificial satellites]]. However, until professionally manned optical tracking stations came on-line in 1958, this network of amateur scientists and other interested citizens played a critical role in providing crucial information regarding the world’s first satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Auchincloss |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=120766 |title=Smithsonian Astronomers Keep Hectic Pace &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; The Harvard Crimson |website=Thecrimson.com |date=1957-11-09 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Moonwatch==
Moonwatch’s origins can be traced to two sources. In the United States, there was a thriving culture of amateur scientists including thousands of citizens who did astronomy for an [[avocation]]. During the Cold War, the United States also encouraged thousands of citizens to take part in the [[Ground Observer Corps]], a nationwide program to spot Soviet bombers. Moonwatch brought together these two activities and attitudes, melding curiosity and vigilance into a thriving activity for citizens. Moonwatch, in other words, was an expression of 1950s popular culture and fixed properly within the context of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=327104 |accessdate=June 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010052130/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=327104 |archivedate=October 10, 2007|title=Russians Launch Artificial Satellite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moonwatch was the brainchild of [[Harvard]] astronomer [[Fred L. Whipple]]. In 1955, as the recently appointed director of the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] in Cambridge, MA, Whipple proposed that amateurs could play a vital role in efforts to track the first satellites. He overcame the objections of colleagues who doubted ordinary citizens could do the job or who wanted the task for their own institutions. Eventually, Whipple carved out a place for amateurs in the IGY.

==Moonwatch's members==
In the late 1950s, thousands of teenagers, housewives, amateur astronomers, school teachers, and other citizens served on Moonwatch teams around the globe. Initially conceived as a way for citizens to participate in science and as a supplement to professionally manned optical and radio tracking stations, Moonwatchers around the world found themselves an essential component of the professional scientists’ research program. Using specially designed telescopes, hand-built or purchased from vendors like [[Radio Shack]], scores of Moonwatchers nightly monitored the skies. Their prompt response was aided by the extensive training they had done by spotting pebbles tossed in the air, registering the flight of moths, and participating in national alerts organized by the [[Civil Air Patrol]].

Once professional scientists had accepted the idea that ordinary citizens could spot satellites and contribute to legitimate scientific research, Whipple and his colleagues organized amateurs around the world. Citizens formed Operation Moonwatch teams in towns and cities all around the globe, built their own equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmob.org/library/clubhistory.php |title=Amateur Telescope Makers of Boston |website=Atmob.org |date=1953-10-19 |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303142614/http://www.atmob.org/library/clubhistory.php |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and courted sponsors. In many cases, Moonwatch was not just a fad but an expression of real interest in science. By October 1957, Operation Moonwatch had some 200 teams ready to go into action, including observers in Hawaii &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifa.hawaii.edu/users/steiger/igy_period.htm |title=Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii |website=Ifa.hawaii.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aswa.info/articles/forty-years-ago.html |title=Astronomical Society of Western Australia (Inc.) |website=Aswa.info |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How Moonwatch worked==

Whipple envisioned a global network of specially designed instruments that could track and photograph satellites. This network, aided by a corps of volunteer satellite spotters and a computer at the [[MIT Computation Center]], would establish [[ephemerides]] – predictions of where a satellite will be at particular times. The instruments at these stations were eventually designed by [[Dr. James G. Baker]] and [[Joseph Nunn]] and hence known as [[Baker-Nunn camera]]s. Based on a series of super-Schmidt wide-angle telescopes and strategically placed around the globe at 12 locations, the innovative cameras could track rapidly moving targets while simultaneously viewing large swaths of the sky.

From the start, Whipple planned that the professionally manned Baker-Nunn stations would be complemented by teams of dedicated amateurs. Amateur satellite spotters would inform the Baker-Nunn stations as to where to look, an important task given that scientists working on the Vanguard program likened finding a satellite in the sky to finding a golf ball tossed out of a jet plane.  Amateur teams would relay the information back to the SAO in Cambridge where professional scientists would use it to generate accurate satellite orbits. At this point, professionals at the Baker-Nunn stations would take over the full-time task of photographing them.

==During the IGY==
[[File:Cincinnati Moonwatch Team sign.jpg|thumb|Historic marker for the [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] team]]
''[[Sputnik 1]]'s'' sudden launch was followed less than a month later with the Soviets orbiting [[Sputnik 2]] and the dog [[Laika]]. Moonwatch teams networked around the world who provided tracking information needed by scientists in Western nations. For the opening months of the Space Age, members of Moonwatch were the only organized worldwide network that was prepared to spot and help track satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862748,00.html |title=THE NATION: Red Moon Over the U.S. |publisher=TIME |date=1957-10-14 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information they provided was complemented by the radio tracking program called [[Minitrack]] the United States Navy operated as well as some information from [[amateur radio]] buffs.

In many cases, Moonwatch teams also had the responsibility of communicating news of [[Sputnik]] and the first American satellites to the public. The public responded, in turn, with infectious enthusiasm as local radio stations aired times to spot satellites and local and national newspapers ran hundreds of articles that described the nighttime activities of Moonwatchers.

Moonwatch caught the attention of those citizens interested in science or the Space Race during the late 1950s and much of the general public as well. Newspapers and popular magazines featured stories about Moonwatch regularly; dozens of articles appeared in the [[Los Angeles Times]], The New Yorker, and The [[New York Times]] alone.  Meanwhile, in the U.S. local businesses sponsored teams with monikers like Spacehounds and The Order of Lunartiks. Meanwhile, Moonwatch teams in Peru, Japan, Australia, and even the Arctic regularly sent their observations to the Smithsonian.

Moonwatch complemented the professional system of satellite tracking stations that Fred Whipple organized around the globe. These two networks – one composed of amateurs and the other of seasoned professionals – helped further Whipple’s personal goals of expanding his own astronomical empire. Operation Moonwatch was the most successful amateur activity of the IGY and it became the public face of a satellite tracking network that expanded the Smithsonian’s global reach. Whipple used satellite tracking as a gateway for his observatory to participate in new research opportunities that appeared in the early years of space exploration.

In February 1958, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] publicly thanked the SAO, Fred Whipple, and the global corps of satellite spotters that comprised Moonwatch for their efforts in tracking the first Soviet and American satellites.

==Moonwatch after the IGY==
Even after the IGY ended, the Smithsonian maintained Operation Moonwatch. Hundreds of dedicated amateur scientists continued to help NASA and other agencies track satellites. Their observations often rivaled those of professional tracking stations, blurring the boundary between professional and amateur.  Moonwatch members and the Smithsonian were important contributors to US Department of Defense satellite tracking research and development efforts, 1957–1961; see [[Project Space Track (1957-1961)|Project Space Track]].

Moonwatch continued long after the IGY ended in 1958. In fact, the Smithsonian operated Moonwatch until 1975 making it one of the longest running amateur science activities ever. As the fad of satellite spotting passed, the Smithsonian refashioned Operation Moonwatch to perform new functions. It encouraged teams of dedicated amateurs to contribute increasingly precise data for satellite tracking. Moonwatchers adapted to the needs of the Smithsonian through the activities of “hard core” groups in places like Walnut Creek, California. Throughout the 1960s, the Smithsonian gave them ever more challenging assignments such as locating extremely faint satellites and tracking satellites as they re-entered the earth’s atmosphere. At times, the precise observations and calculations of dedicated Moonwatchers surpassed the work of professionals.

One of the most notable activities of Moonwatchers after the IGY was the observance of [[Sputnik 4]] when it reentered the atmosphere in September 1962. Moonwatchers and other amateur scientists near Milwaukee, WI observed the flaming re-entry and their observations eventually led to the recovery and analysis of several fragments from the Soviet satellite.

==Moonwatch's legacy==
Moonwatch affected the lives of participants long after they stopped looking for satellites. When the Smithsonian discontinued the program in 1975, one long-time Moonwatcher compared his participation to “winning the Medal of Honor.” Moonwatch inspired some future scientists, for example, [[James A. Westphal]], a Moonwatcher from Oklahoma, who eventually helped design instruments for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] at [[Caltech]]. The program boosted science programs at many schools throughout the country and helped revitalize amateur science in the United States.

The [[United States Space Surveillance Network]] and other modern tracking systems are professional and automated, but amateurs remain active in [[satellite watching]].

== Modelling ==
Behaviour in this task can be modelled using a standard, model-free [[reinforcement learning]] algorithm. In this model, the values of the different actions are learned over time and are used to determine the next action according to a predefined action-selection rule. It was shown that a substantial effect of first experience on behaviour is consistent with the reinforcement learning model if one assumes that the outcome of first experience resets the values of the experienced actions, but not if  symmetric initial conditions are assumed.

Moreover, the predictive power of the resetting model outperforms previously published&lt;ref name="ErevErt2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erev|first1=Ido|last2=Ert|first2=Eyal|last3=Roth|first3=Alvin E.|last4=Haruvy|first4=Ernan|last5=Herzog|first5=Stefan M.|last6=Hau|first6=Robin|last7=Hertwig|first7=Ralph|last8=Stewart|first8=Terrence|last9=West|first9=Robert|last10=Lebiere|first10=Christian|title=A choice prediction competition: Choices from experience and from description|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=23|issue=1|year=2010|pages=15–47|issn=0894-3257|doi=10.1002/bdm.683|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/5343169/Roth_ChoicePrediction.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; models regarding the aggregate choice behaviour.

== Relation to other form of primacy ==
These findings suggest that first experience has a disproportionately large effect on subsequent actions, similar to [[Serial position effect#Primacy effect|primacy effects]] in other fields of cognitive psychology, such as in the application of the [[serial position effect]]. The mechanism of resetting of the initial conditions that underlies outcome primacy may thus also account for other forms of primacy.

A '''seed germinator''' is a device for [[seed germination|germinating seeds]].  Typically, these create an environment in which light, humidity and temperature are controlled to provide optimum conditions for the [[germination]] of [[seed]]s.

One type of germinator is the '''Copenhagen''' or '''Jacobsen tank'''.  The seeds rest upon [[blotting paper]] which is kept moist by [[Capillary action|wick]]s which draw from a bath of water whose temperature is regulated.  The humidity around each seed is kept high by means of glass funnels and a lid covering the tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The encyclopedia of seeds |page=104 |chapter=Copenhagen tank |isbn=978-0-85199-723-0 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Beyond the Standard Model|expanded=Supersymmetry}}

In [[particle physics]], '''supersymmetry''' ('''SUSY''') is a principle that proposes a relationship between two basic classes of elementary particles: [[boson]]s, which have an integer-valued [[Spin (physics)|spin]], and [[fermion]]s, which have a half-[[integer spin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haber|first1=Howie|title=SUPERSYMMETRY, PART I (THEORY)|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2014/reviews/rpp2014-rev-susy-1-theory.pdf|website=Reviews, Tables and Plots|publisher=Particle Data Group (PDG)|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title=supersymmetry | dictionary=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=October 2, 2017 | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supersymmetry}}&lt;/ref&gt; A type of [[Spacetime symmetries|spacetime symmetry]], supersymmetry is a possible candidate for [[physics beyond the Standard Model|undiscovered particle physics]], and seen as an elegant solution to many current problems in particle physics if confirmed correct, which could resolve various areas where current theories are believed to be incomplete. A supersymmetrical extension to the [[Standard Model]] would resolve major [[hierarchy problem]]s within [[gauge theory]], by guaranteeing that quadratic [[The problem of infinities|divergences]] of all orders will [[cancel out]] in [[perturbation theory]].

In supersymmetry, each particle from one group would have an associated particle in the other, which is known as its [[superpartner]], the spin of which differs by a half-integer. These superpartners would be new and undiscovered particles. For example, there would be a particle called a ''"selectron"'' (superpartner electron), a [[boson]]ic partner of the [[electron]]. In the simplest supersymmetry theories, with perfectly "[[broken symmetry|unbroken]]" supersymmetry, each pair of superpartners would share the same mass and internal [[quantum number]]s besides spin. Since we expect to find these "superpartners" using present-day equipment, if supersymmetry exists then it consists of a [[spontaneously broken symmetry]] allowing superpartners to differ in mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

There is no evidence at this time to show whether or not supersymmetry is correct, or what other extensions to current models might be more accurate. In part this is because it is only [[Large Hadron Collider|since around 2010]] that [[particle accelerator]]s specifically designed to study [[physics beyond the Standard Model]] have become operational, and because it is not yet known where exactly to look nor the energies required for a successful search. 

The main reasons for supersymmetry being supported by physicists is that the current theories are known to be incomplete and their limitations are well established, and supersymmetry would be an attractive solution to some of the major concerns.

Such EDM experiments are also much more scalable than conventional particle accelerators and offer a practical alternative to detecting physics beyond the standard model as accelerator experiments become increasingly costly and complicated to maintain.

These findings disappointed many physicists, who believed that supersymmetry (and other theories relying upon it) were by far the most promising theories for "new" physics, and had hoped for signs of unexpected results from these runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolchover |first=Natalie |title=Supersymmetry Fails Test, Forcing Physics to Seek New Ideas |journal=Quanta Magazine |date=November 20, 2012 |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20121120-as-supersymmetry-fails-tests-physicists-seek-new-ideas/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolchover |first=Natalie |title=What No New Particles Means for Physics |journal=Quanta Magazine |date=August 9, 2016 |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-no-new-particles-means-for-physics-20160809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former enthusiastic supporter [[Mikhail Shifman]]  went as far as urging the theoretical community to search for new ideas and accept that supersymmetry was a failed theory.&lt;ref&gt;M.

== Motivations ==

There are numerous phenomenological motivations for supersymmetry close to the electroweak scale, as well as technical motivations for supersymmetry at any scale.

=== The hierarchy problem ===
Supersymmetry close to the [[electroweak scale]] ameliorates the [[hierarchy problem]] that afflicts the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David|first1=Curtin|title=MODEL BUILDING AND COLLIDER PHYSICS ABOVE THE WEAK SCAE|date=August 2011|issue=COLLIDER PHYSICS ABOVE THE WEAK SCALE|url=http://www.lepp.cornell.edu/rsrc/Home/Research/GradTheses/Curtin_David.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Standard Model, the electroweak scale receives enormous [[Planck mass|Planck-scale]] quantum corrections. The observed hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale must be achieved with extraordinary [[fine tuning]]. In a [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|supersymmetric theory]], on the other hand, Planck-scale quantum corrections cancel between partners and superpartners (owing to a minus sign associated with fermionic loops). The hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale is achieved in a [[naturalness (physics)|natural]] manner, without miraculous fine-tuning.

=== Gauge coupling unification ===
The idea that the gauge symmetry groups unify at high-energy is called [[Grand unification theory]]. In the Standard Model, however, the [[weak interactions|weak]], [[strong interactions|strong]] and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] couplings fail to unify at high energy.  In a supersymmetry theory, the running of the gauge couplings are modified, and precise high-energy unification of the gauge couplings is achieved. The modified running also provides a natural mechanism for radiative [[electroweak symmetry breaking]].

=== Dark matter ===
TeV-scale supersymmetry (augmented with a discrete symmetry) typically provides a candidate [[dark matter]] particle at a mass scale consistent with thermal relic abundance calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Feng: [http://theory.fnal.gov/jetp/talks/feng.pdf Supersymmetric Dark Matter ''(pdf)''], University of California, Irvine, 11 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torsten Bringmann: [http://www.desy.de/~troms/teaching/SoSe11/DM_slides_05.pdf The WIMP "Miracle" ''(pdf)''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301033728/http://www.desy.de/~troms/teaching/SoSe11/DM_slides_05.pdf |date=2013-03-01 }} University of Hamburg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other technical motivations ===
Supersymmetry is also motivated by solutions to several theoretical problems, for generally providing many desirable mathematical properties, and for ensuring sensible behavior at high energies. Supersymmetric [[quantum field theory]] is often much easier to analyze, as many more problems become mathematically tractable. When supersymmetry is imposed as a ''local'' symmetry, Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] is included automatically, and the result is said to be a theory of [[supergravity]]. It is also a necessary feature of the most popular candidate for a [[theory of everything]], [[superstring theory]], and a SUSY theory could explain the issue of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmological inflation]].

Another theoretically appealing property of supersymmetry is that it offers the only "loophole" to the [[Coleman–Mandula theorem]], which prohibits spacetime and internal [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] from being combined in any nontrivial way, for [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] like the Standard Model with very general assumptions. The [[Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem]] demonstrates that supersymmetry is the only way spacetime and internal symmetries can be combined consistently.&lt;ref&gt;R. Haag, J. T. Łopuszański and M. Sohnius, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6TVC-4718W97-YF/1/bc160d55fb6a0faddac181fcff6871ce All Possible Generators Of Supersymmetries Of The S Matrix]", Nucl. Phys. B 88 (1975) 257&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|History of string theory}}

A supersymmetry relating [[mesons]] and [[baryons]] was first proposed, in the context of hadronic physics, by [[Hironari Miyazawa]] in 1966. This supersymmetry did not involve spacetime, that is, it concerned internal symmetry, and was broken badly. Miyazawa's work was largely ignored at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It remains a vital part of many proposed theories of physics.

The first realistic supersymmetric version of the Standard Model was proposed in 1977 by Pierre Fayet and is known as the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] or MSSM for short. It was proposed to solve, amongst other things, the [[hierarchy problem]].

== Applications ==

=== Extension of possible symmetry groups ===
One reason that physicists explored supersymmetry is because it offers an extension to the more familiar symmetries of quantum field theory. These symmetries are grouped into the [[Poincaré group]] and internal symmetries and the [[Coleman–Mandula theorem]] showed that under certain assumptions, the symmetries of the [[S-matrix]] must be a direct product of the Poincaré group with a [[Compact space|compact]] internal symmetry group or if there is not any [[mass gap]], the [[conformal group]] with a compact internal symmetry group. In 1971 Golfand and Likhtman were the first to show that the Poincaré algebra can be extended through introduction of four anticommuting spinor generators (in four dimensions), which later became known as supercharges.
in 1975 the [[Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius theorem]] analyzed all possible superalgebras in the general form, including those with an extended number of the supergenerators and [[central charge]]s. This extended super-Poincaré algebra paved the way for obtaining a very large and important class of supersymmetric field theories.

==== The supersymmetry algebra ====
{{Main article|Supersymmetry algebra}}
Traditional symmetries of physics are generated by objects that transform by the [[tensor]] [[representations of Lie groups|representations]] of the [[Poincaré group]] and internal symmetries. Supersymmetries, however, are generated by objects that transform by the [[spin representation]]s. According to the [[spin-statistics theorem]], [[boson]]ic fields [[commutative operation|commute]] while [[fermion]]ic fields [[anticommutativity|anticommute]]. Combining the two kinds of fields into a single [[Lie algebra|algebra]] requires the introduction of a [[graded algebra|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-grading]] under which the bosons are the even elements and the fermions are the odd elements. Such an algebra is called a [[Lie superalgebra]].

The simplest supersymmetric extension of the [[Poincaré algebra]] is the [[Super-Poincaré algebra]]. Expressed in terms of two [[Weyl spinor]]s, has the following [[commutator|anti-commutation]] relation:
:&lt;math&gt;\{ Q_{ \alpha }, \bar{Q}_{ \dot{ \beta }} \} = 2( \sigma{}^{\mu} )_{ \alpha \dot{ \beta }} P_{\mu} &lt;/math&gt;
and all other anti-commutation relations between the ''Q''s and commutation relations between the ''Q''s and ''P''s vanish. In the above expression &lt;math&gt; P_{\mu} = -i \partial{}_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; are the generators of translation and &lt;math&gt;\sigma{}^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Pauli matrices]].

There are [[representation of a Lie superalgebra|representations of a Lie superalgebra]] that are analogous to representations of a Lie algebra. Each Lie algebra has an associated Lie group and a Lie superalgebra can sometimes be extended into representations of a [[Lie supergroup]].

=== The Supersymmetric Standard Model ===
{{Main article|Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model}}
Incorporating supersymmetry into the [[Standard Model]] requires doubling the number of particles since there is no way that any of the particles in the Standard Model can be [[superpartner]]s of each other. With the addition of new particles, there are many possible new interactions. The simplest possible supersymmetric model consistent with the Standard Model is the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (MSSM) which can include the necessary additional new particles that are able to be [[superpartner]]s of those in the [[Standard Model]].
[[Image:Hqmc-vector.svg|thumb|300px|right|Cancellation of the [[Higgs boson]] quadratic [[mass renormalization]] between [[fermion]]ic [[top quark]] loop and [[scalar field|scalar]] stop [[squark]] [[tadpole (physics)|tadpole]] [[Feynman diagram]]s in a supersymmetric extension of the [[Standard Model]]]]

One of the main motivations for SUSY comes from the quadratically divergent contributions to the Higgs mass squared. The quantum mechanical interactions of the Higgs boson causes a large renormalization of the Higgs mass and unless there is an accidental cancellation, the natural size of the Higgs mass is the greatest scale possible. This problem is known as the [[hierarchy problem]].  Supersymmetry reduces the size of the quantum corrections by having automatic cancellations between fermionic and bosonic Higgs interactions. If supersymmetry is restored at the weak scale, then the Higgs mass is related to supersymmetry breaking which can be induced from small non-perturbative effects explaining the vastly different scales in the weak interactions and gravitational interactions.

In many supersymmetric Standard Models there is a heavy stable particle (such as [[neutralino]]) which could serve as a [[weakly interacting massive particle]] (WIMP) [[dark matter]] candidate. The existence of a supersymmetric dark matter candidate is related closely to [[R-parity]].

The standard paradigm for incorporating supersymmetry into a realistic theory is to have the underlying dynamics of the theory be supersymmetric, but the ground state of the theory does not respect the symmetry and supersymmetry is [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|broken spontaneously]]. The supersymmetry break can not be done permanently by the particles of the MSSM as they currently appear. This means that there is a new sector of the theory that is responsible for the breaking. The only constraint on this new sector is that it must break supersymmetry permanently and must give superparticles TeV scale masses. There are many models that can do this and most of their details do not matter. In order to parameterize the relevant features of supersymmetry breaking, arbitrary [[soft SUSY breaking]] terms are added to the theory which temporarily break SUSY explicitly but could never arise from a complete theory of supersymmetry breaking.

==== Gauge-coupling unification ====
{{Main article|Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model#Gauge-coupling unification}}
One piece of evidence for supersymmetry existing is gauge coupling unification.
The [[renormalization group]] evolution of the three gauge [[coupling constant]]s of the [[Standard Model]] is somewhat sensitive to the present particle content of the theory. These coupling constants do not quite meet together at a common energy scale if we run the renormalization group using the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="GKane"&gt;Gordon L. Kane, ''The Dawn of Physics Beyond the Standard Model'', [[Scientific American]], June 2003, page 60 and ''The frontiers of physics'', special edition, Vol 15, #3, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of minimal SUSY joint convergence of the coupling constants is projected at approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; [[GeV]].&lt;ref name="GKane"/&gt;

=== Supersymmetric quantum mechanics ===
{{Main article|Supersymmetric quantum mechanics}}
''Supersymmetric quantum mechanics'' adds the SUSY superalgebra to [[quantum mechanics]] as opposed to [[quantum field theory]]. Supersymmetric quantum mechanics often becomes relevant when studying the dynamics of supersymmetric [[solitons]], and due to the simplified nature of having fields which are only functions of time (rather than space-time), a great deal of progress has been made in this subject and it is now studied in its own right.

SUSY quantum mechanics involves pairs of [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]] which share a particular mathematical relationship, which are called ''partner Hamiltonians''. (The [[potential energy]] terms which occur in the Hamiltonians are then known as ''partner potentials''.) An introductory theorem shows that for every [[eigenstate]] of one Hamiltonian, its partner Hamiltonian has a corresponding eigenstate with the same energy. This fact can be exploited to deduce many properties of the eigenstate spectrum. It is analogous to the original description of SUSY, which referred to bosons and fermions. We can imagine a "bosonic Hamiltonian", whose eigenstates are the various bosons of our theory. The SUSY partner of this Hamiltonian would be "fermionic", and its eigenstates would be the theory's fermions. Each boson would have a fermionic partner of equal energy.

=== Supersymmetry in condensed matter physics ===

SUSY concepts have provided useful [[Supersymmetric WKB approximation|extensions]] to the [[WKB approximation]]. Additionally, SUSY has been applied to disorder averaged systems both quantum and non-quantum (through [[statistical mechanics]]), the [[Fokker-Planck equation]] being an example of a non-quantum theory. The 'supersymmetry' in all these systems arises from the fact that one is modelling one particle and as such the 'statistics' don't matter. The use of the supersymmetry method provides a mathematical rigorous alternative to the [[replica trick]], but only in non-interacting systems, which attempts to address the so-called 'problem of the denominator' under disorder averaging. For more on the applications of supersymmetry in [[condensed matter physics]] see the book&lt;ref&gt;''Supersymmetry in Disorder and Chaos'', Konstantin Efetov, Cambridge university press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The topological sector of the so-emerging [[supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics]] can be recognized as the [[Topological quantum field theory|Witten-type topological field theory]].

The meaning of the topological supersymmetry in dynamical systems is the preservation of the phase space continuity—infinitely close points will remain close during continuous time evolution even in the presence of noise. When the topological supersymmetry is broken spontaneously, this property is violated in the limit of the infinitely long temporal evolution and the model can be said to exhibit (the stochastic generalization of) the [[butterfly effect]]. From a more general perspective, spontaneous breakdown of the topological supersymmetry is the theoretical essence of the ubiquitous dynamical phenomenon variously known as [[Chaos theory|chaos]], [[turbulence]], [[self-organized criticality]] etc. The [[Goldstone boson|Goldstone theorem]] explains the associated emergence of the long-range dynamical behavior that manifests itself as [[Pink noise|1/f noise]], [[butterfly effect]], and the scale-free statistics of sudden (instantonic) processes, e.g., earthquakes, neuroavalanches, solar flares etc., known as the [[Zipf's law]] and the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]].

=== Supersymmetry in mathematics ===
SUSY is also sometimes studied mathematically for its intrinsic properties. This is because it describes complex fields satisfying a property known as [[holomorphic function|holomorphy]], which allows holomorphic quantities to be exactly computed. This makes supersymmetric models useful "[[toy model]]s" of more realistic theories. A prime example of this has been the demonstration of S-duality in four-dimensional gauge theories&lt;ref name="krasnitz02"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; that interchanges particles and [[Magnetic monopole|monopoles]].

The proof of the [[Atiyah-Singer index theorem#Heat equation|Atiyah-Singer index theorem]] is much simplified by the use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

=== Supersymmetry in quantum gravity ===
{{string theory|expanded=related}}

{{Main|Superstring theory|String theory}}

Supersymmetry is part of [[superstring theory]], a [[string theory]] of [[quantum gravity]], although it could in theory be a component of other quantum gravity theories as well, such as [[loop quantum gravity]]. For [[superstring theory]] to be consistent, supersymmetry seems to be required at some level (although it may be a strongly broken symmetry). If experimental evidence confirms supersymmetry in the form of [[supersymmetric particle]]s such as the [[neutralino]] that is often believed to be the lightest [[superpartner]], some people believe this would be a major boost to [[superstring theory]]. Since supersymmetry is a required component of superstring theory, any discovered supersymmetry would be consistent with superstring theory. If the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and other major particle physics experiments fail to detect supersymmetric partners, many versions of [[superstring theory]] which had predicted certain low mass superpartners to existing particles may need to be significantly revised.

== General supersymmetry ==
Supersymmetry appears in many related contexts of theoretical physics. It is possible to have multiple supersymmetries and also have supersymmetric extra dimensions.

=== Extended supersymmetry ===
It is possible to have more than one kind of supersymmetry transformation. Theories with more than one supersymmetry transformation are known as [[extended supersymmetry|extended supersymmetric]] theories. The more supersymmetry a theory has, the more constrained are the field content and interactions. Typically the number of copies of a supersymmetry is a power of 2, i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8. In four dimensions, a spinor has four degrees of freedom and thus the minimal number of supersymmetry generators is four in four dimensions and having eight copies of supersymmetry means that there are 32 supersymmetry generators.

The maximal number of supersymmetry generators possible is 32. Theories with more than 32 supersymmetry generators automatically have massless fields with spin greater than 2. It is not known how to make massless fields with spin greater than two interact, so the maximal number of supersymmetry generators considered is 32. This is due to the [[Weinberg-Witten theorem]]. This corresponds to an ''N'' = 8 supersymmetry theory. Theories with 32 supersymmetries automatically have a [[graviton]].

For four dimensions there are the following theories, with the corresponding multiplets&lt;ref&gt;Polchinski,J. ''String theory. Vol. 2: Superstring theory and beyond'', Appendix B
&lt;/ref&gt; (CPT adds a copy, whenever they are not invariant under such symmetry)
* ''N'' = 1
Chiral multiplet:
(0,{{frac|1|2}})
Vector multiplet:
({{frac|1|2}},1)
Gravitino multiplet:
(1,{{frac|3|2}})
Graviton multiplet:
({{frac|3|2}},2)
* ''N'' = 2
hypermultiplet:
(-{{frac|1|2}},0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,{{frac|1|2}})
vector multiplet:
(0,{{frac|1|2}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,1)
supergravity multiplet:
(1,{{frac|3|2}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,2)
* ''N'' = 4
Vector multiplet:
(-1,-{{frac|1|2}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;,0&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;,{{frac|1|2}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;,1)
Supergravity multiplet:

* ''N'' = 8
Supergravity multiplet:
(-2,-{{frac|3|2}}&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;,-1&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;,-{{frac|1|2}}&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;,0&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;,{{frac|1|2}}&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;,1&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;,{{frac|3|2}}&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;,2)

=== Supersymmetry in alternate numbers of dimensions ===
It is possible to have supersymmetry in dimensions other than four. Because the properties of spinors change drastically between different dimensions, each dimension has its characteristic. In ''d'' dimensions, the size of spinors is approximately 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''/2&lt;/sup&gt; or 2&lt;sup&gt;(''d''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2&lt;/sup&gt;. Since the maximum number of supersymmetries is 32{{why|date=October 2018}}, the greatest number of dimensions in which a supersymmetric theory can exist is eleven.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Fractional supersymmetry===
Fractional supersymmetry is a generalization of the notion of supersymmetry in which the minimal positive amount of spin does not have to be &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; but can be an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;1/N&lt;/math&gt; for integer value of ''N''. Such a generalization is possible in two or less [[spacetime]] dimensions.

==Current status==
Supersymmetric models are constrained by a variety of experiments, including measurements of low-energy observables – for example, the [[Anomalous magnetic dipole moment|anomalous magnetic moment of the muon]] at [[Fermilab]]; the [[WMAP]] dark matter density measurement and direct detection experiments – for example, [[XENON]]-100 and [[Large Underground Xenon experiment|LUX]]; and by particle collider experiments, including [[B-physics]], Higgs phenomenology and direct searches for superpartners (sparticles), at the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]], [[Tevatron]] and the [[LHC]].

Historically, the tightest limits were from direct production at colliders. The first mass limits for squarks and gluinos were made at [[CERN]] by the [[UA1 experiment]] and the [[UA2 experiment]] at the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]]. LEP later set very strong limits,&lt;ref&gt;LEPSUSYWG, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL experiments, charginos, large m0 LEPSUSYWG/01-03.1&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2006 were extended by the D0 experiment at the Tevatron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The D0-Collaboration |title=Search for associated production of charginos and neutralinos in the trilepton final state using 2.3 fb&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of data |year=2009 |arxiv=0901.0646 |bibcode = 2009PhLB..680...34D |doi = 10.1016/j.physletb.2009.08.011 |volume=680 |issue=1 |journal=Physics Letters B |pages=34–43|hdl=10211.3/195394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The D0 Collaboration |title=Search for squarks and gluinos in events with jets and missing transverse energy using 2.1 fb-1 of pp¯ collision data at s=1.96 TeV |arxiv=0712.3805 |year=2008 |bibcode = 2008PhLB..660..449D |doi = 10.1016/j.physletb.2008.01.042 |volume=660 |issue=5 |journal=Physics Letters B |pages=449–457}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003-2015, [[WMAP]]'s and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]'s [[dark matter]] density measurements have strongly constrained supersymmetry models, which, if they explain dark matter, have to be tuned to invoke a particular mechanism to sufficiently reduce the [[neutralino]] density.

Prior to the beginning of the LHC, in 2009 fits of available data to CMSSM and NUHM1 indicated that squarks and gluinos were most likely to have masses in the 500 to 800 GeV range, though values as high as 2.5 TeV were allowed with low probabilities. Neutralinos and sleptons were expected to be quite light, with the lightest neutralino and the lightest stau most likely to be found between 100 and 150 GeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0907.5568|title=Likelihood Functions for Supersymmetric Observables in Frequentist Analyses of the CMSSM and NUHM1|journal=The European Physical Journal C|volume=64|issue=3|pages=391–415|author=O.

The first run of the [[LHC]] found no evidence for supersymmetry, and, as a result, surpassed existing experimental limits from the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] and [[Tevatron]] and partially excluded the aforementioned expected ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roszkowski|first1=Leszek|last2=Sessolo|first2=Enrico Maria|last3=Williams|first3=Andrew J.|title=What next for the CMSSM and the NUHM: improved prospects for superpartner and dark matter detection|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|date=11 August 2014|volume=2014|issue=8|pages=67|doi=10.1007/JHEP08(2014)067|arxiv = 1405.4289 |bibcode = 2014JHEP...08..067R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011–12, the [[LHC]] discovered a [[Higgs boson]] with a mass of about 125 GeV, and with couplings to fermions and bosons which are consistent with the [[Standard Model]]. The MSSM predicts that the mass of the lightest [[Higgs boson]] should not be much higher than the mass of the [[Z boson]], and, in the absence of [[fine tuning]] (with the supersymmetry breaking scale on the order of 1 TeV), should not exceed 135 GeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Higgs Boson Theory and Phenomenology|author=Marcela Carena and Howard E. Haber|arxiv=hep-ph/0208209v3|year=2003|bibcode=2003PrPNP..50...63C|last2=Haber|volume=50|issue=1|pages=63–152|journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics|doi=10.1016/S0146-6410(02)00177-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[LHC]] result seemed problematic for the minimal supersymmetric model, as the value of 125 GeV is relatively large for the model and can only be achieved with large radiative loop corrections from top [[squarks]], which many theorists had considered to be "unnatural" (see [[naturalness (physics)]] and [[fine tuning]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Implications of a 125 GeV Higgs for the MSSM and Low-Scale SUSY Breaking|journal=Physical Review D|volume=85|issue=9|pages=095007|last1=Draper|first1=Patrick|date=December 2011|arxiv=1112.3068|bibcode = 2012PhRvD..85i5007D |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.85.095007 |last2=Meade|first2=Patrick|displayauthors=1|last3=Reece|first3=Matthew|last4=Shih|first4=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne''''', or just '''''The Natural History of Selborne''''' is a book by English [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] [[Gilbert White]]. It was first published in 1789 by his brother [[Benjamin White (publisher)|Benjamin]]. It has been continuously in print since then, with nearly 300 editions up to 2007.&lt;ref name=TH&gt;{{cite web | title=The Illustrated Natural History of Selborne | url=http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500284780.mxs?7aede63cc91090dcd78be0b3c1f44f59&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203211520/http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500284780.mxs?7aede63cc91090dcd78be0b3c1f44f59&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2013-02-03 | publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson | edition=2004 | accessdate=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was published late in White's life, compiled from a mixture of his letters to other naturalists — [[Thomas Pennant]] and [[Daines Barrington]]; a 'Naturalist's Calendar' (in the second edition) comparing [[phenology]] observations made by White and [[William Markwick]] of the first appearances in the year of different animals and plants; and observations of natural history organized more or less systematically by species and group. A second volume, less often reprinted, covered the antiquities of Selborne. Some of the letters were never posted, and were written for the book.

White's ''Natural History'' was at once well received by contemporary critics and the public, and continued to be admired by a diverse range of nineteenth and twentieth century literary figures including [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[John Ruskin]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[W.

==Overview==
[[File:North East view of Selborne from the Short Lythe. Foldout frontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Foldout frontispiece, ''North East view of Selborne from the Short Lythe'', drawn by [[Samuel Hieronymus Grimm]]]]

The main part of the book, the ''Natural History'', is presented as a compilation of 44 letters nominally to [[Thomas Pennant]], a leading British [[zoologist]] of the day, and 66 letters to [[Daines Barrington]], an English [[barrister]] and Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. In these letters, White details the natural history of the area around his family home at the vicarage of [[Selborne]] in [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref name= white&gt;{{cite book | last = White | first = Gilbert |title = The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne | year =  1887 |origyear=1789 |location=London | publisher =Cassell &amp; Company| oclc=3423785 |pages=38–39 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20933/20933-h/20933-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the 'letters' were never posted, and were written especially for the book. Patrick Armstrong, in his book ''The English Parson-Naturalist'', notes that in particular, "an obvious example is the first, nominally to Thomas Pennant, but which is clearly contrived, as it introduces the parish, briefly summarizing its position, geography and principal physical features."&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, 2000. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; White's biographer, Richard Mabey, estimates that up to 46 out of 66 'letters to Daines Barrington' "were probably never sent through the post";&lt;ref name=Mabey202&gt;Mabey, 1986. pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; Mabey explains that it is hard to be more precise, because of White's extensive editing. Some letters are dated although never sent. Some dates have been altered. Some letters have been cut down, split into shorter 'letters', merged, or distributed in small parts into other letters. A section about insect-eating birds in a letter sent to Barrington in 1770 appears in the book as letter 41 to Pennant. Personal remarks have been removed throughout. Thus, while the book is genuinely based on letters to Pennant and Barrington, the structure of the book is a literary device.&lt;ref name=Mabey202/&gt;

As a compilation of letters and other materials, the book as a whole has an uneven structure. The first part is a diary-like sequence of 'letters', with the breaks and wanderings that naturally follow. The second is a calendar, organized by [[phenology|phenological]] event around the year. The third is a collection of observations, organised by animal or plant group and species, with a section on meteorology. The apparently rambling structure of the book is in fact bracketed by opening and closing sections, arranged like the rest as letters, which "give form and scale and even a semblance of narrative structure to what would otherwise have been a shapeless anthology."&lt;ref name=Mabey202/&gt; The unposted Letter 1 begins

: The parish of Selborne lies in the extreme eastern corner of the county of [[Hampshire]], bordering on the county of [[Sussex]], and not far from the county of [[Surrey]]; is about fifty miles south-west of London, in latitude fifty-one, and near mid-way between the towns of [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]] and [[Petersfield]]. Being very large and extensive, it abuts on twelve parishes, two of which are in Sussex—viz, Trotton and Rogate.&amp;nbsp;... The soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the views and aspects. The high part of the south-west consists of a vast hill of chalk, rising three hundred feet above the village, and is divided into a sheep-down, the high wood and a long hanging wood, called The Hanger. The covert of this eminence is altogether ''[[beech]]'', the most lovely of all forest trees, whether we consider its smooth rind or bark, its glossy foliage, or graceful pendulous boughs. The down, or sheepwalk, is a pleasing park-like spot, of about one mile by half that space, jutting out on the verge of the hill-country, where it begins to break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being an assemblage of hill, dale, wood-lands, heath, and water. The prospect is bounded to the south-east and east by the vast range of mountains called the [[Sussex Downs]], by Guild-down near [[Guildford]], and by the Downs round [[Dorking]], and [[Reigate|Ryegate]] in Surrey, to the north-east, which altogether, with the country beyond Alton and [[Farnham]], form a noble and extensive outline.&lt;ref&gt;White, 1789. Letter 1 to Thomas Pennant.&lt;/ref&gt;

"No novelist could have opened better", wrote [[Virginia Woolf]]; "Selborne is set solidly in the foreground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Captain's Death Bed and Other Essays | publisher=Harcourt, Brace | author=Woolf, Virginia | authorlink=Virginia Woolf | year=1950 | work=White's Selborne}} cited by Mabey 1986, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition was illustrated with paintings by the Swiss artist [[Samuel Hieronymus Grimm]], engraved by W. Angus and aquatinted. Grimm had lived in England since 1768, and was quite a famous artist, costing 2½ guineas per week. In the event, he stayed in Selborne for 28 days, and White recorded that he worked very hard on 24 of them. White also described Grimm's method, which was to sketch the landscape in lead pencil, then to put in the shading, and finally to add a light wash of watercolour.&lt;ref&gt;Mabey 1986, pp. 156, 158, 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations were engraved (signed at lower right) by a variety of engravers including [[William Angus (engraver)|William Angus]] and [[Peter Mazell]].

[[File:ThomasPennant oil.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Correspondent: the Welsh author and naturalist [[Thomas Pennant]] (1726–1798)]]

==== Letters to Thomas Pennant ====
{{Quote box | quote= A little yellow bird (it is either a species of the ''Alauda trivialis'', or rather perhaps of the ''Motacilla trochilus'') still continues to make a sibilous shivering noise in the tops of tall woods. The stoparola of [[John Ray|Ray]] (for which we have as yet no name in these parts) is called in your zoology the [[Spotted flycatcher|flycatcher]]. There is one circumstance characteristic of this bird which seems to have escaped observation, and that is, it takes its stand on the top of some stake or post, from whence it springs forth on its prey, catching a fly in the air, and hardly ever touching the ground, but returning still to the same stand for many times together. | source=Gilbert White, ''The Natural History of Selborne''. Letter 10 to Pennant | align=right | width=33%}}

There are 44 letters to White's friend [[Thomas Pennant]] (1726–1798), of which the first nine were never posted and are thus undated. Of those that were posted, the first, Letter 10 giving an overview of Selborne, is dated 4 August 1767; the last, Letter 44 on wood pigeons, is dated 30 November 1780. It is not known how the men became friends, or even if they ever met; White writes repeatedly that he would like to meet "to have a little conversation face to face after we have corresponded so freely for several years"&lt;ref name=Mabey105&gt;Mabey, 1986, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; so it is certain they did not meet for long periods, and possible they never met at all. The letters are edited from the form in which they were actually posted; for example, Letter 10 as posted had a cringing introductory paragraph of thanks to Pennant which White edited out of the published version.&lt;ref name=Mabey105/&gt;

==== Letters to the Hon. Daines Barrington ====
[[File:Daines Barrington.jpg|thumb|upright|Correspondent: the English lawyer and naturalist [[Daines Barrington]] (1727–1800)]]

There are 66 letters to the lawyer [[Daines Barrington]]  (1727–1800), occupying half the book. Letter 1, on summer birds of passage, is dated 30 June 1769; Letter 66, on thunderstorms, is dated 25 June 1787. The Barrington letters therefore largely overlap the time frame of those to Pennant, but began and ended somewhat later. It was Barrington who suggested to White that he should write a book from his observations; although Pennant had been corresponding with White for a while, he was relying on White for natural history information for his own books, and, suggests White's biographer [[Richard Mabey]], must have wanted White as a continuing source of information, not as a rival author.&lt;ref name=Mabey119&gt;Mabey, 1986, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Barrington, on the other hand, liked to theorize about the natural world, but had little interest in making observations himself, and tended to accept claimed facts uncritically.&lt;ref name=Mabey119/&gt;

A character in some of the letters is a tortoise:

{{quote|The old tortoise, that I have mentioned in a former letter, still continues in this garden, and retired underground about the 20th of November, and came out again for one day on the 30th : it lies now buried in a wet swampy border under a wall facing to the south, and is enveloped at present in mud and mire !&lt;ref&gt;White, 1789. Letter 17 to Barrington.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Letter 65 describes the summer of 1783 as "an amazing and portentous one, and full of horrible phenomena; for, besides the alarming meteors and tremendous thunderstorms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom, the peculiar haze, or smoky fog, that prevailed for many weeks in this island, and in every part of Europe, and even beyond its limits, was a most extraordinary appearance, unlike anything known within the memory of man&amp;nbsp;... The sun, at noon, looked as blank as a clouded moon, and shed a rust-coloured ferruginous light on the ground, and floors of rooms; but was particularly lurid and blood-coloured at rising and setting. All this time the heat was so intense that butcher's meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;White, 1789. Barrington, Letter 65.&lt;/ref&gt; This was caused by the eruption of the [[Laki]] [[volcano]] in [[Iceland]] between 8 June 1783 and February 1784, killing up to a quarter of the people of Iceland and spreading a haze as far as Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/15/iceland-volcano-weather-french-revolution | title=How an Icelandic volcano helped spark the French Revolution | publisher=The Guardian | date=15 April 2010 | accessdate=2013-05-19 | author=Neale, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Antiquities of Selborne ===

This section, often omitted from later editions, consists like the ''Natural History'' of 26 "Letters", none of them posted, and without even the fiction of being addressed to Pennant or Barrington. Letter 1 begins "It is reasonable to suppose that in remote ages this woody and mountainous district was inhabited only by bears and wolves."&lt;ref&gt;White, 1789. ''Antiquities'', Letter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Letter 2 discusses Selborne in [[Anglo-Saxon|Saxon]] times; Selborne was according to White a royal manor, belonging to Editha, queen to [[Edward the Confessor]].&lt;ref&gt;White, 1789. ''Antiquities'', Letter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Letter 3 describes the village's church, which "has no pretensions to antiquity, and is, as I suppose, of no earlier date than the beginning of the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]."&lt;ref&gt;White, 1789. ''Antiquities'', Letter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Letter 5 describes the ancient [[Yew|Yew tree]] in the churchyard. Letter 7 describes the (ruined) priory. Letter 11 discusses the properties of the [[Knights Templar]] in and near the village.

Letter 14 describes the visit of bishop [[William of Wykeham]] in 1373, to correct the scandalous "particular abuses"&lt;ref name=Antiquities14&gt;White, 1789. ''Antiquities'', Letter 14.&lt;/ref&gt; in the religious houses in the parish. He orders the canons of Selborne priory (Item 5th) "to take care that the doors of their church and priory be so attended to that no suspected and disorderly females, ''suspectae at aliae inhonestae'', pass through their choir and cloiser in the dark";&lt;ref name=Antiquities14/&gt; (Item 10th) to cease "living dissolutely after the flesh, and not after the spirit"&lt;ref name=Antiquities14/&gt; as it has been proven that some of the canons "sleep naked in their beds without their breeches and shirts";&lt;ref name=Antiquities14/&gt; (Item 11th) to stop "keeping hounds, and publicly attending hunting-matches" and "noisy tumultuous huntings";&lt;ref name=Antiquities14/&gt; (Item 17th) to properly maintain their houses and the convent itself, since they have allowed "through neglect, notorious dilapidations to take place";&lt;ref name=Antiquities14/&gt; (Item 29th) to stop wearing "foppish ornaments, and the affectation of appearing like beaux with garments edged with costly furs, with fringed gloves, and silken girdles trimmed with gold and silver."&lt;ref name=Antiquities14/&gt; Richard Mabey describes White's reaction to the "Priory saga" as "grave disapproval of the monks' sensuality and&amp;nbsp;... general delinquency".&lt;ref&gt;Mabey, 1986. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sequence of Letters then relate the history of the priors of Selborne, until Letter 24 which relates the takeover of the priory by [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] under bishop [[William Waynflete]] in 1459. White describes this as a disastrous fall: "Thus fell the considerable and well-endowed priory of Selborne after it had subsisted about two hundred and fifty-four years; about seventy-four years after the suppression of priories alien by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]., and about fifty years before the general [[dissolution of the monasteries]] by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]."&lt;ref&gt;White, 1789. ''Antiquities'', Letter 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The final letter records that "No sooner did the priory .. become an appendage to the college, but it must at once have tended to swift decay."&lt;ref name=Antiquities26&gt;White, 1789. ''Antiquities'', Letter 26.&lt;/ref&gt; White notes that since then, even "the very foundations have been torn up for the repair of the highways"&lt;ref name=Antiquities26/&gt; so that nothing is left but a rough pasture "full of hillocks and pits, choaked with nettles, and dwarf-elder, and trampled by the feet of the ox and the heifer".&lt;ref name=Antiquities26/&gt; White had reason to be bitter about the takeover by Magdalen College, as it had made them Lords of the Manor of Selborne, which in turn gave them the right to appoint the parish priest.&lt;ref&gt;Mabey, 1986. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; White's biographer Richard Mabey casts doubt on the "frequent assumption" that White's "deepest regret was that he could never be vicar of Selborne",&lt;ref&gt;Mabey, 1986. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; but it was true that he was ineligible, as only fellows of Magdalen could be granted the living.&lt;ref name=Barnett/&gt;

=== A Naturalist's Calendar ===

==== From the year 1768 to the year 1793 ====

This section, compiled posthumously, contains a list of some 500 [[phenology|phenological]] observations in Selborne from White's manuscripts, organised by [[William Markwick]] (1739–1812), and supplemented by Markwick's own observations from [[Catsfield]], near Battle, Sussex. The observations depend on the latitude of these places and on the (global) climate, forming a baseline for comparison with modern observations. For example, "[[European cuckoo|Cuckoo]]  ''(Cuculus canorus)'' heard" is recorded by White for 7—26 April, and by Markwick for 15 April and 3 May (presumably only once at the earlier date) and "last heard" by Markwick on 28 June. The table begins as follows:

This is the longest section of the observations, with comments in each instance by Markwick.

; Observations on [[Quadrupeds]]
These are a few entries on sheep, rabbits, cats and squirrels, horse and hounds.

; Observations on [[Insects]] and Vermes
The 'Vermes' cover glow-worms, earthworms, snails and slugs, and a "snake's slough", a cast skin.

; Observations on [[Plants|Vegetables]]
The observations relate to trees, seeds, "beans sown by birds", "cucumbers set by bees", and a few fungi (truffles, ''Tremella nostoc'', and fairy rings).

; [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] Observations
These are a few curiosities such as frozen sleet and the "black spring" of 1771. He also recorded the effects on the weather of the 1783 volcanic eruption of the Icelandic crater [[Laki]].

==Reception==

===Contemporary===

White's lifelong friend John Mulso wrote to him in 1776, correctly predicting that "Your work, upon the whole, will immortalize your Place of Abode as well as Yourself."&lt;ref name=Mulso&gt;{{cite book | title=The Letters to Gilbert White of Selborne, From His Intimate Friend and Contemporary The Rev. John Mulso | publisher=R. H. Porter | author=Mulso, John | year=1906 | page=266 | editor=Holt-White, Rashleigh | work=Letter to Gilbert White, 16 July 1776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas White wrote "a long, appreciative, but.. properly restrained review"&lt;ref name=Mabey207&gt;Mabey, 1986. p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; of his brother's book in ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' of January 1789, commenting that "Sagacity of observation runs through the work".&lt;ref name=DH&gt;{{cite journal | title=Early Reviews of 'The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne' | author=Davidson-Houston, R. | journal=The Selborne Association Newsletter |date=December 2005 | issue=47 | pages=22–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous reviewer in ''The Topographer'' of April 1789 wrote that "A more delightful, or more original work than Mr. White's History of Selborne has seldom been published&amp;nbsp;... Natural History has evidently been the author's principal study, and, of that, ornithology is evidently the favourite. The book is not a compilation from former publications, but the result of many years' attentive observations to nature itself, which are told not only with the precision of a philosopher, but with that happy selection of circumstances, which mark the ''poet''."&lt;ref name=Mabey207/&gt;&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;

===Nineteenth century===

In 1830, an anonymous critic, in what critic Tobias Menely called a description of Selborne "as a place that lingers beyond the spatio-temporal horizon of modern life",&lt;ref name=Menely/&gt; wrote having visited the village that

:[T]he sequestered retreat of the naturalist still remains&amp;nbsp;... inaccessible to all the improved knowledge and refinement which belong to these enlightened and virtuous times. It has been excluded from the blessings of increasing commerce and population, from factories and filiations, manufactures and [[Methodism]], genius and gin, prosperity and pauperism.&lt;ref name=Holt-White&gt;{{cite journal | title=Selborne | author=Anon | journal=New Monthly Magazine | year=1830 | volume=30 | issue=2 | pages=565–566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edwardian era===

The 1907–1921 [[Cambridge History of English and American Literature]] begins its essay on White's ''Selborne'' with the words

:Gilbert White's ''Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'' (1789) holds a unique position in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It is not easy to give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=16.

White is sometimes treated as a pioneer of [[ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, D.L., Heinsohn, R.G. and Lindenmayer, D.B. 2005. Ecology. Pp.&amp;nbsp;97–112 in R.Q. Grafton, L. Robin and R.J. Wasson (eds.), ''Understanding the Environment: Bridging the Disciplinary Divides''. Sydney, NSW: University of New South Wales Press, (p. 99).&lt;/ref&gt; The British ornithologist [[James Fisher (naturalist)|James Fisher]] gives a more balanced view, writing in 1941:&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;James Fisher in the preface to the 1941 [[Penguin Books]] edition&lt;/ref&gt; 
:His world is round and simple and complete; the British country; the perfect escape.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt;

:"White has the strange power to make natural historians of his readers, whether gardeners, historians or biologists", noting that this demands analysis. He observes further that "White is straight out of [[Jane Austen]]. If it were not for his fame as a naturalist and writer, nothing in his life would distinguish him from hundreds of country parsons in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Natural History of Selborne is an oddly unassuming masterpiece, its haphazard construction revealing the process by which White came to write it."&lt;ref name=Barnett/&gt;

Barnett notes, too, that
:Part of White's appeal lies in this ability to summon a powerful, particular vision of pre-industrial England. He offers his readers the key to a walled garden of mellow [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne]] brick, lying beside [[Thomas Gray]]'s country churchyard and an ancient [[Water-meadow|water meadow]].&lt;ref name=Barnett/&gt;

[[Yale University|Yale]] nonfiction tutor Fred Strebeigh, writing in ''[[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon magazine]]'' in 1988, compared White with [[Henry Thoreau]]'s [[Walden]]:&lt;ref name=Strebeigh&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.strebeigh.com/dawn-natural-history.html | title=Letters from Selborne | publisher=Strebeigh.com (originally in ''Audubon'' magazine) | date=November 1988 | accessdate=2013-05-17 | author=Strebeigh, Fred}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Out of the ruts and the ways of its village, Selborne fashioned a new natural history.  It spoke simply, with a human voice.  But it looked profoundly.  It pioneered a way for students of nature who wished, as White did, not to roam the high Arctic or far Pacific but to fathom their own terrain.  It offered a wide world to anyone willing to dig deep.  Selborne said:  watch narrowly, skim close to the ground.  It whispered, hushed, what Thoreau would later broadcast:  "We are acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live.  Most have not delved six feet beneath the surface, nor leaped as many above it.  We know not where we are."  In those words, as in all Walden, Thoreau may have had in mind the village of Selborne and the Reverend Gilbert White--the town reached only by [[sunken lane|ruts running well beneath the surface]], the man whose book had leapt the ruts to round the globe.&lt;ref name=Strebeigh/&gt;

Tobias Menely of [[Indiana University]] notes that the book "has garnered praise from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], [[Virginia Woolf|Woolf]], and [[W. H. Auden|Auden]]"&lt;ref name=Menely&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/537462/Traveling_in_Place_Gilbert_Whites_Cosmopolitan_Parochialism | title=Traveling in Place:Gilbert White's Cosmopolitan Parochialism | author=Menely, Tobias | journal=Eighteenth-Century Life | year=2004 | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=46–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that

The [[naturalist]] Richard Mabey writes in his biography of White that&lt;ref name=Mabey3&gt;Mabey, 1986. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
:I must confess that, like many others, I did not come painlessly to the ''Natural History''. For years I was put off by the aura of sanctity and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.&lt;ref name=Mabey3/&gt;

==Manuscript==

The manuscript for the book stayed in the White family until 1895, when it was auctioned at Sotheby's. The purchaser was Stuart M. Samuel, who mounted the letters and bound the book in green Morocco leather. His library was sold in 1907. The manuscript was bought by the dealer A.S.W. Rosenbach in 1923, and passed into the collection of Arthur A. Houghton. The Houghton collection was auctioned by Christie's in 1980, where the manuscript was purchased by and for Gilbert White's museum at The Wakes, Selborne, where it is displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/heritage100/itemlist/item.htm?itemid=158 | title=Natural History of Selborne - Gilbert White's original manuscript | publisher=Hampshire County Council | year=2013 | accessdate=10 April 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190533/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/heritage100/itemlist/item.htm?itemid=158 | archive-date=4 March 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Bewick]], in the first volume (''Land Birds'') of his ''[[A History of British Birds]]'' (1797), presents a phenological list of 19 birds which are "chiefly selected from Mr. White's Natural History of Selborne, and are arranged nearly in the order of their appearing". The list begins with the [[wryneck]] ("Middle of March"), places the [[cuckoo]] in the middle of April, and ends with the [[Spotted flycatcher|flycatcher]] in the middle of May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of British Birds | publisher=Beilby and Bewick | author=Bewick, Thomas | year=1797–1804 | location=Newcastle | volume=1: Land Birds | chapter=Introduction | pages=xxii–xxiii | authorlink=Thomas Bewick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] read the ''Natural History'' as a young man, inspiring him to take "much pleasure in watching the habits of birds" and to wonder "why every gentleman did not become an ornithologist".&lt;ref name="Mayr1982"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |title=The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHThtE2R0UQC&amp;pg=PA397 |year=1982 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-36446-2 |page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sara Losh]], too, read the ''Natural History'' as part of her "wonderful, varied and advanced [home] education for a young girl".&lt;ref name="Uglow2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Uglow |first=Jenny |title=The Pinecone |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suS_sWzvHC4C&amp;pg=PT69 |year=2012 |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |isbn=978-0-571-29045-1 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White's ''Natural History'' has been continuously in print since its first publication. A paperback edition of ''The Illustrated Natural History of Selborne'' was reprinted by [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] in 2007. It was long held ("apocryphally", according to White's biographer, Richard Mabey) to be the fourth-most published book in the English language after the [[Bible]], the [[Complete Works of Shakespeare|works of Shakespeare]], and [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.&lt;ref name=Mabey&gt;Mabey, 1986. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

White's frequent accounts in ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'' of his [[tortoise]] Timothy, inherited from his aunt, form the basis for a variety of literary mentions. [[Verlyn Klinkenborg]]'s book, ''Timothy; or, Notes of an Abject Reptile'' (2006) is based wholly on that reptile, as is [[Sylvia Townsend Warner]]'s ''The Portrait of a Tortoise'' (1946).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zaltzmann |first1=Helen |title=Slow and steady |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/01/fiction.features3 |accessdate=28 September 2016 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Books and Articles on the Tortoise in History, Literature, and Art |url=http://www.thetortoisetable.org.uk/site/reading_for_pleasure_33.asp |publisher=The Tortoise Table |accessdate=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002014909/http://www.thetortoisetable.org.uk/site/reading_for_pleasure_33.asp |archive-date=2 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tortoise also finds its way into science, as its species, ''[[Testudo whitei]]'' (Bennett 1836), long thought to be a synonym of ''[[Testudo graeca]]'', has been rediscovered in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Highfield |first1=A.C. |last2=Martin |first2=J. |title=New light on an old tortoise - Gilbert White's Selborne tortoise re-discovered |url=http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/algeria.html |publisher=Tortoise Trust |accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various writers have commented on the book. The poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] called it "This sweet delightful book".&lt;ref name=house&gt;{{cite web |title=Gilbert White |url=http://www.gilbertwhiteshouse.org.uk/gilbert-white/ |publisher=Gilbert White's House &amp; The Oates Collections |accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Virginia Woolf]] observed that "By some apparently unconscious device .. a door [is] left open, through which we hear distant sounds."&lt;ref name=house/&gt; Among poets, [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]] wrote that "In this present year, 1915, at least, it is hard to find a flaw in the life he led"&lt;ref name=house/&gt; while [[W. H. Auden]] stated that "Selfishly, I, too, would have plumbed to know you: I could have learned so much."&lt;ref name=house/&gt; The naturalist and broadcaster [[David Attenborough]] called White "A man in total harmony with his world."&lt;ref name=house/&gt; The novelist [[Roald Dahl]] has the main character in his short story "[[The Visitor (short story)|The Visitor]]" read the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dahl |first=Roald |title=The Visitor (A Roald Dahl Short Story) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSonAp195U0C&amp;pg=PT58 |year=2012 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-1-4059-1120-7 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer and zookeeper [[Gerald Durrell]] commented in ''The Amateur Naturalist'' that White "simply observed nature with a sharp eye and wrote about it lovingly."&lt;ref name=house/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">'''The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline''' (TOPP) is a set of computational tools that can be chained together to tailor problem-specific analysis pipelines for HPLC-MS data. It transforms most of the [[OpenMS]] functionality into small command line tools that are the building blocks for more complex analysis pipelines. The functionality of the tools ranges from data preprocessing (file [[data conversion|format conversion]], baseline reduction, noise reduction, peak picking, map alignment,...) over quantitation (isotope-labeled and label-free) to identification (wrapper tools for [[Mascot (software)|Mascot]], [[Sequest]], [[InsPecT]] and [[OMSSA]]).

TOPP is developed in the groups of Prof. Knut Reinert [http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-bio/] at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and in the group of Prof. Kohlbacher [http://www-bs.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/] at the [[University of Tübingen]].

For more detailed information about the TOPP tools, see the TOPP [http://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/pub/OpenMS/release-documentation/html/index.html documentation] of the latest release and the TOPP publication in the references.

The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline is [[free software]] released under the 3-clause [[BSD license]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://open-ms.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/open-ms/OpenMS/README?revision=10801&amp;view=markup readme], [http://open-ms.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/open-ms/OpenMS/License.txt?revision=10801&amp;view=markup license.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''University Physics''''' is the name of a two-volume physics textbook written by [[Hugh D. Young|Hugh Young]] and Roger Freedman. The first edition of ''University Physics'' was published by [[Mark Zemansky]] and [[Francis Sears]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="australia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pearson.com.au/student/university/product-listing-page/product-details-page/?isbn=9781442517110 |title=University Physics  |publisher=Pearson Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Young became a coauthor with Sears and Zemansky in 1973. Now in its 14th edition, ''University Physics'' is among the most widely used introductory textbooks in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/fac_staff/handbook/YoungBio.html |title=About Hugh D.

'''''Voyager 2''''' is a [[space probe]] launched by [[NASA]] on August 20, 1977, to study the [[outer planets]]. Part of the [[Voyager program]], it was launched 16 days before its twin, ''[[Voyager 1]]'', on a trajectory that took longer to reach [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] but enabled further encounters with [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name=ESBS/&gt; It is the only spacecraft to have visited either of the [[ice giants]].

Its primary mission ended with the [[Exploration of Neptune|exploration of the Neptunian system]] on October 2, 1989, after having visited the [[Exploration of Uranus|Uranian system]] in 1986, the [[Exploration of Saturn|Saturnian system]] in 1981, and the [[Exploration of Jupiter|Jovian system]] in 1979. ''Voyager 2'' is now in its extended mission to study the outer reaches of the Solar System and has been operating for {{Age in years, months and days|year=1977|month=08|day=20}} as of {{date|{{TODAY}}|mdy}}. It remains in contact through the [[NASA Deep Space Network|Deep Space Network]].&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/index.html Voyager - The Interstellar Mission Mission Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502011335/http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/index.html |date=2011-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

===Background===
In the early space age, it was realized that a coincidental alignment of the outer planets would occur in the late 1970s and enable a single probe to visit [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]] by taking advantage of the then-new technique of [[gravity assist]]s. [[NASA]] began work on a [[Grand Tour program|Grand Tour]], which evolved into a massive project involving two groups of two probes each, with one group visiting Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto and the other Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. The spacecraft would be designed with redundant systems to ensure survival through the entire tour. By 1972 the mission was scaled back and replaced with two Mariner-derived spacecraft, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. To keep apparent lifetime program costs low, the mission would include only flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, but keep the Grand Tour option open.&lt;ref name=ESBS/&gt;{{rp|263}} As the program progressed, the name was changed to Voyager.&lt;ref&gt;[https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/planetary.html Planetary Voyage] [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] – California Institute of Technology. March 23, 2004. Retrieved April 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary mission of ''Voyager 1'' was to explore Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. ''Voyager 2'' was also to explore Jupiter and Saturn, but on a trajectory that would have option of continuing on to Uranus and Neptune, or being redirected to Titan as a backup for ''Voyager 1''. Upon successful completion of ''Voyager 1''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s objectives, ''Voyager 2'' would get a mission extension to send the probe on towards Uranus and Neptune.&lt;ref name=ESBS&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butrica|first1=Andrew|title=From Engineering Science to Big Science|page=267|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter11.html|accessdate=2015-09-04|quote=Despite the name change, Voyager remained in many ways the Grand Tour concept, though certainly not the Grand Tour (TOPS) spacecraft. Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977, followed by Voyager 1 on September 5, 1977. The decision to reverse the order of launch had to do with keeping open the possibility of carrying out the Grand Tour mission to Uranus, Neptune, and beyond. Voyager 2, if boosted by the maximum performance from the Titan-Centaur, could just barely catch the old Grand Tour trajectory and encounter Uranus. Two weeks later, Voyager 1 would leave on an easier and much faster trajectory, visiting Jupiter and Saturn only. Voyager 1 would arrive at Jupiter four months ahead of Voyager 2, then arrive at Saturn nine months earlier. Hence, the second spacecraft launched was Voyager 1, not Voyager 2. The two Voyagers would arrive at Saturn nine months apart, so that if Voyager 1 failed to achieve its Saturn objectives, for whatever reason, Voyager 2 still could be retargeted to achieve them, though at the expense of any subsequent Uranus or Neptune encounter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spacecraft design===
Constructed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), ''Voyager 2'' included 16 [[hydrazine]] thrusters, [[three-axis stabilization]], [[gyroscopes]] and celestial referencing instruments (Sun sensor/[[Canopus]] Star Tracker) to maintain pointing of the [[high-gain antenna]] toward Earth. Collectively these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem ('''AACS''') along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects as it traveled through space.&lt;ref name="PDS-Host"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov/ds-view/pds/viewHostProfile.jsp?INSTRUMENT_HOST_ID=VG2 |title=VOYAGER 2:Host Information |date=1989 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Communications====
Built with the intent for eventual interstellar travel, ''Voyager 2'' included a large, {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} parabolic, [[high-gain antenna]] ('''''[[:File:Voyager Program - High-gain antenna diagram.png|see diagram]]''''') to transceive data via the [[Deep Space Network]] on [[the Earth]]. Communications are conducted over the [[S-band]] (about 13&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength) and [[X-band]] (about 3.6&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength) providing data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second at the distance of Jupiter, and then ever-decreasing as the distance increased, because of the [[inverse-square law]]. When the spacecraft [[Line-of-sight propagation|is unable to communicate with Earth]], the Digital Tape Recorder ('''DTR''') can record about 64 kilobytes of data for transmission at another time.&lt;ref name="nasa.77.136"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA News Press Kit 77-136 |publisher=JPL/NASA |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=9476.0;attach=591860|accessdate=December 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Power====
The spacecraft was equipped with 3 [[MHW-RTG|Multihundred-Watt radioisotope thermoelectric generators]] ('''MHW RTG'''). Each RTG includes 24 pressed plutonium oxide spheres, and provided enough heat to generate approximately 157 W of electrical power at launch. Collectively, the RTGs supplied the spacecraft with 470 watts at launch (halving every 87.7 years), and will allow operations to continue until at least 2020.&lt;ref name="PDS-Host" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voyager 2 Craft Details|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1977-076A|website=NASA-NSSDC-Spacecraft-Details|publisher=NASA|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NuclearNews"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furlong |first1=Richard R. |last2=Wahlquist |first2=Earl J. |date=1999 |title=U.S. space missions using radioisotope power systems |journal=Nuclear News |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=26–34 |url=http://www2.ans.org/pubs/magazines/nn/pdfs/1999-4-2.pdf |accessdate=January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch and trajectory==
The ''Voyager 2'' probe was launched on August 20, 1977, by NASA from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41|Space Launch Complex 41]] at [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]], aboard a [[Titan IIIE]]/[[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] [[carrier rocket|launch vehicle]]. Two weeks later, the twin ''Voyager 1'' probe would be launched on September 5, 1977. However, ''Voyager 1'' would reach both Jupiter and Saturn sooner, as ''Voyager 2'' had been launched into a longer, more circular trajectory.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In April 1978, a complication arose when no commands were transmitted to ''Voyager 2'' for a period of time, causing the spacecraft to switch from its primary radio receiver to its backup receiver.&lt;ref name="New-Scientist_January-31-1985"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=All set to encounter Uranus |page=24 |last=Henbest |first=Nigel |date=January 31, 1985 |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnxQfGl8qfkC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=voyager%20spacecraft%20receiver&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime afterwards, the primary receiver failed altogether. The backup receiver was functional, but a failed capacitor in the receiver meant that it could only receive transmissions that were sent at a precise frequency, and this frequency would be affected by the Earth's rotation (due to the [[Doppler effect]]) and the onboard receiver's temperature, among other things.&lt;ref name="New-Scientist_January-31-1985"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System |last=Littmann |first=Mark |year=2004 |publisher=[[Courier Corporation]] |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoJMadct4TQC&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=voyager%20spacecraft%20receiver&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 19, 2018|isbn=9780486436029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Voyage to the tilted planet |last=Davies |first=John |date=January 23, 1986 |page=42 |magazine=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYIJJP7audkC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=voyager%20spacecraft%20receiver&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each subsequent transmission to ''Voyager 2'', it was necessary for engineers to calculate the specific frequency for the signal so that it could be received by the spacecraft.
&lt;!--too editorial, complete rewrite necessary

===Complications===
Some weeks later, the ground controllers for the Voyager program became engrossed in an early post-launch problem with ''Voyager 1'', and they forgot to send an important updating code to ''Voyager 2''. (These space probes had been programmed to expect a radio message of some kind from the [[Deep Space Network]] at least once per week to verify that their radio systems were still working.) This failure to receive a radio message caused ''Voyager 2'' to shut down its primary radio receiver, and to switch over to its identical back-up receiver, which had a subtle defect in it. In the process of switching back and forth between the receivers a few times, a fuse in the DC power supply of the primary receiver blew, permanently disabling it. Thus the back-up receiver had to be relied upon for the entire mission.

Fortunately, after waiting one more week, ''Voyager 2'' automatically switched to its back-up radio receiver once more, and the Deep Space Network radio engineers were able to re-establish contact through the spacecraft's back-up radio receiver. This radio receiver has remained somewhat "finicky" ever since then, but it has been "nursemaided" along technically, and it has never failed. Also, periodically, files of procedures for ''Voyager 2'' to follow in the future have been uploaded via the Deep Space Network to give ''Voyager 2'' a sketchy plan of what to do for many months, in case the radio receiver ever did permanently fail, cutting off all messages from the Earth to ''Voyager 2''.

However, the back-up radio receiver for ''Voyager 2'' has not failed, and it remains in operation as of November 28, 2009. There has never been a problem with the two radio receivers for ''Voyager 1'', or any problem with the X-band [[traveling wave tube]] transmitters for either ''Voyager 1'' or ''Voyager 2''.

''Voyager 2's'' gyroscopes and its computer were operational during its Titan/Centaur launch phase, monitoring the sequence of events, in order for those systems to take over the space probe's [[Attitude dynamics and control|attitude control]] and other functions upon separation from the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stage. But at that point, the unexpected happened: ''Voyager 2's'' computer experienced robotic "vertigo". In its confusion, it helplessly switched to backup sensors, presuming its "senses" to be defective.

''Voyager 2's'' disoriented flight-control computer remained disconnected from ''Voyager's'' powerful thrusters at this point, so it did not cause damage to the launch during the launching itself. The Centaur's attitude-control system stayed in charge, suffering no "vertigo" and, as planned, it electronically corrected the disequilibrium of the ''Voyager's'' computer just before separation.

From the spacecraft's control center, engineers and technicians helplessly watched the antics of ''Voyager 2's'' disoriented computer. One hour and 11 minutes after lift-off, ''Voyager 2's'' own dedicated solid rocket fired for 45 seconds, to supply the final increment of [[momentum]] that it needed to get to Jupiter.

One-and-one-half minutes after ''Voyager 2's'' key rocket burn ended, the three-meter-long articulating arm holding the television camera and other remote-sensing instruments unlatched and deployed as planned. After this, ''Voyager 2's'' computer once again sensed an emergency for some reason. This time it switched to a different set of thrusters and activated valves to control the tiny bursts of gas that stabilized its attitude in space. ''Voyager 2's'' robotic "alter ego" (its executive program) then challenged portions of its own computer in a frantic attempt to correct the orientation failure that it sensed.

At this point, ''Voyager 2'' followed the normal procedures that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers had installed in the computer to cope with the most dreaded emergency for a robot spacecraft in deep space—attitude-control disorientation. ''Voyager 2'' shut down most communications with the Earth in order to begin its reorientation.

Seventy-nine minutes passed while ''Voyager 2'' struggled alone and unaided to find the Sun with a light sensor and to establish a known orientation point. Finally, ''Voyager 2'' radioed back to the Earth that it was operating normally. It was unknown at this point if the redundant sensors were malfunctioning, or if its on-board digital computer was defective.

The fault protection in ''Voyager 2's'' computer was operating at this point on the now-painful assumption that it would be triggered only by a hardware failure hundreds of millions of miles from Earth. In that event, ''Voyager 2'' would be unable to establish even emergency communications with its human flight controllers, who could not help it much at that distance, in any case.

''Voyager 2'' had been programmed to virtually shut off communications with the Earth during such deep-space emergencies and to attempt to fix itself. Somehow, these procedures had been triggered right after the launching, when they should not have been. There had been no hardware problems in the computer—just a slight but serious mis-setting of attitude-control parameters in the on-board computer.

===Encounter with Jupiter===
{{main|Exploration of Jupiter}}
[[File:Voyager-2 Jupiter-flyby July-10-1979.png|thumb|The trajectory of Voyager 2 through the Jupiter system]]
''Voyager 2''{{'}}s closest approach to Jupiter occurred on July 9, 1979. It came within {{convert|570,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the planet's cloud tops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/history/70s/Voyager2_1979.htm|title=History|website=www.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It discovered a few [[Rings of Jupiter|rings around Jupiter]], as well as volcanic activity on the moon [[Io (moon)|Io]].

The [[Great Red Spot]] was revealed as a complex storm moving in a counterclockwise direction. An array of other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds.

Discovery of active volcanism on Io was easily the greatest unexpected discovery at Jupiter. It was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. Together, the Voyagers observed the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io, and there is evidence that other eruptions occurred between the two Voyager fly-bys.

The moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] displayed a large number of intersecting linear features in the low-resolution photos from ''Voyager 1''. At first, scientists believed the features might be deep cracks, caused by crustal rifting or tectonic processes. The closer high-resolution photos from ''Voyager 2'', however, left scientists puzzled: The features were so lacking in topographic relief that as one scientist described them, they "might have been painted on with a felt marker." Europa is internally active due to tidal heating at a level about one-tenth that of Io. Europa is thought to have a thin crust (less than {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick) of water ice, possibly floating on a 50-kilometer-deep (30 mile) ocean.

Two new, small satellites, [[Adrastea (moon)|Adrastea]] and [[Metis (moon)|Metis]], were found orbiting just outside the ring. A third new satellite, [[Thebe (moon)|Thebe]], was discovered between the orbits of [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]] and Io.

===Encounter with Saturn===
{{main|Exploration of Saturn}}
The closest approach to Saturn occurred on August 26, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/EventQuery.jsp|title=NASA - NSSDCA - Master Catalog - Event Query|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While passing behind Saturn (as viewed from Earth), ''Voyager 2'' probed Saturn's upper atmosphere with its radio link to gather information on atmospheric temperature and density profiles. ''Voyager 2'' found that at the uppermost pressure levels (seven [[kilopascal]]s of pressure), Saturn's temperature was 70 [[kelvin]]s (−203&amp;nbsp;°C), while at the deepest levels measured (120 kilopascals) the temperature increased to 143&amp;nbsp;K (−130&amp;nbsp;°C). The north pole was found to be 10 kelvins cooler, although this may be seasonal (''see also [[Saturn#Best viewing|Saturn Oppositions]]'').

After the fly-by of Saturn, the camera platform of ''Voyager 2'' locked up briefly, putting plans to officially extend the mission to Uranus and Neptune in jeopardy. The mission's engineers were able to fix the problem (caused by an overuse that temporarily depleted its lubricant), and the ''Voyager 2'' probe was given the go-ahead to explore the Uranian system.

===Encounter with Uranus===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
{{main|Exploration of Uranus}}
The closest approach to Uranus occurred on January 24, 1986, when ''Voyager 2'' came within {{convert|81,500|km|mi|sp=us}} of the planet's cloud tops. ''Voyager 2'' also discovered the moons [[Cordelia (moon)|Cordelia]], [[Ophelia (moon)|Ophelia]], [[Bianca (moon)|Bianca]], [[Cressida (moon)|Cressida]], [[Desdemona (moon)|Desdemona]], [[Juliet (moon)|Juliet]], [[Portia (moon)|Portia]], [[Rosalind (moon)|Rosalind]], [[Belinda (moon)|Belinda]], [[Perdita (moon)|Perdita]] and [[Puck (moon)|Puck]]; studied the planet's unique atmosphere, caused by its [[axial tilt]] of 97.8°; and examined the [[Rings of Uranus|Uranian ring system]].

[[Uranus]] is the third largest (Neptune has a larger mass, but a smaller volume) planet in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a distance of about 2.8&amp;nbsp;billion kilometers (1.7&amp;nbsp;billion miles), and it completes one orbit every 84 Earth years. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by ''Voyager 2'' is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axial tilt is about 90°, meaning that its axis is roughly parallel with, instead of roughly perpendicular to, the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. This extremely large tilt of its axis is thought to be the result of a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet-sized body early in the history of the Solar System. Given the unusual orientation of its axis, with the polar regions of Uranus exposed for periods of many years to either continuous sunlight or darkness, planetary scientists were not at all sure what to expect when observing Uranus.

''Voyager 2'' found that one of the most striking effects of the sideways orientation of Uranus is the effect on the tail of the planetary magnetic field. This is itself tilted about 60° from the Uranian axis of rotation. The planet's magneto tail was shown to be twisted by the rotation of Uranus into a long corkscrew shape following the planet. The presence of a significant magnetic field for Uranus was not at all known until ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s arrival.

The radiation belts of Uranus were found to be of an intensity similar to those of Saturn. The intensity of radiation within the Uranian belts is such that irradiation would "quickly" darken — within 100,000 years — any methane that is trapped in the icy surfaces of the inner moons and ring particles. This kind of darkening might have contributed to the darkened surfaces of the moons and the ring particles, which are almost uniformly dark gray in color.

A high layer of haze was detected around the sunlit pole of Uranus. This area was also found to radiate large amounts of ultraviolet light, a phenomenon that is called "dayglow." The average atmospheric temperature is about 60&amp;nbsp;K (−350°[[Fahrenheit|F]]/−213°[[Celsius|C]]). Surprisingly, the illuminated and dark poles, and most of the planet, exhibit nearly the same temperatures at the cloud tops.

The Uranian moon [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], the innermost of the five large moons, was discovered to be one of the strangest bodies yet seen in the Solar System. Detailed images from ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s flyby of Miranda showed huge canyons made from [[Fault (geology)|geological faults]] as deep as {{convert|20|km|mi|sp=us}}, terraced layers, and a mixture of old and young surfaces. One [[hypothesis]] suggests that Miranda might consist of a reaggregation of material following an earlier event when Miranda was shattered into pieces by a violent impact.

All nine of the previously known Uranian rings were studied by the instruments of ''Voyager 2''. These measurements showed that the Uranian rings are distinctly different from those at Jupiter and Saturn. The Uranian ring system might be relatively young, and it did not form at the same time that Uranus did. The particles that make up the rings might be the remnants of a moon that was broken up by either a high-velocity impact or [[Roche limit|torn up by tidal effects]].

===Encounter with Neptune===
{{main|Exploration of Neptune}}
Following a mid-course correction in 1987, ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s closest approach to Neptune occurred on August 25, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Voyager Steered Toward Neptune|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/555835|accessdate=6 December 2017|work=Ukiah Daily Journal|date=15 March 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FactSheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/news/factsheet.html |title=Fact Sheet |publisher=JPL |date= |accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nardo|2002|p=15|Ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this was the last planet of the Solar System that ''Voyager 2'' could visit, the Chief Project Scientist, his staff members, and the flight controllers decided to also perform a close fly-by of [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], the larger of Neptune's two originally known moons, so as to gather as much information on Neptune and Triton as possible, regardless of Voyager 2's departure angle from the planet. This was just like the case of ''Voyager 1's'' encounters with Saturn and its massive moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

Through repeated computerized test simulations of trajectories through the Neptunian system conducted in advance, flight controllers determined the best way to route ''Voyager 2'' through the Neptune-Triton system. Since the plane of the orbit of Triton is tilted significantly with respect to the plane of the ecliptic, through mid-course corrections, ''Voyager 2'' was directed into a path about three thousand miles above the north pole of Neptune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Neptune |url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/neptune.html |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Triton was behind and below (south of) Neptune (at an angle of about 25 degrees below the ecliptic), close to the [[apoapsis]] of its elliptical orbit. The gravitational pull of Neptune bent the trajectory of ''Voyager 2'' down in the direction of Triton. In less than 24 hours, ''Voyager 2'' traversed the distance between Neptune and Triton, and then observed Triton's northern hemisphere as it passed over its north pole.

The net and final effect on ''Voyager 2'' was to bend its trajectory south below the plane of the ecliptic by about 30 degrees. ''Voyager 2'' is on this path permanently, and hence, it is exploring space south of the plane of the ecliptic, measuring magnetic fields, charged particles, etc., there, and sending the measurements back to the Earth via [[telemetry]].

While in the neighborhood of Neptune, ''Voyager 2'' discovered the "[[Great Dark Spot]]", which has since disappeared, according to observations by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Originally thought to be a large cloud itself, the "Great Dark Spot" was later hypothesized to be a hole in the visible cloud deck of Neptune.

With the decision of the [[International Astronomical Union]] to reclassify [[Pluto]] as a "[[dwarf planet]]" in 2006, the flyby of Neptune by ''Voyager 2'' in 1989 became the point when every known planet in the Solar System had been visited at least once by a space probe.

==Interstellar mission==
Once its planetary mission was over, ''Voyager 2'' was described as working on an interstellar mission, which NASA is using to find out what the [[Solar System]] is like beyond the [[heliosphere]]. ''Voyager 2'' is currently transmitting scientific data at about 160 [[bits per second]]. Information about continuing telemetry exchanges with ''Voyager 2'' is available from Voyager Weekly Reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/weekly-reports/index.htm |title=Voyager Weekly Reports |publisher=Voyager.jpl.nasa.gov |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 ''Voyager 2'' observed the nova [[V1974 Cygni]] in the far-ultraviolet.&lt;ref name=Ulivi449 /&gt; 

In July 1994 an attempt was made to observe the impacts fragments of the comet [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]] with Jupiter.&lt;ref name=Ulivi449 /&gt; The craft's position meant it had a direct line of sight to the impacts and observations were made in the ultraviolet and radio spectrum.&lt;ref name=Ulivi449 /&gt;  Voyager 2 failed to detect anything with calculations showing that the fireballs were just below the craft's limit of detection.&lt;ref name=Ulivi449&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ulivi |first1=Paolo |last2=Harland |first2= David M |date=2007 |title=Robotic Exploration of the Solar System Part I: The Golden Age 1957-1982  |publisher=Springer |page=449 |isbn=9780387493268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''November 29, 2006''', a telemetered command to ''Voyager 2'' was incorrectly decoded by its on-board computer—in a random error—as a command to turn on the electrical heaters of the spacecraft's magnetometer. These heaters remained turned on until December 4, 2006, and during that time, there was a resulting high temperature above {{convert|130|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, significantly higher than the magnetometers were designed to endure, and a sensor rotated away from the correct orientation. As of this date it had not been possible to fully diagnose and correct for the damage caused to ''Voyager 2's'' magnetometer, although efforts to do so were proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://vgrmag.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/voyager/quicklook/v2-warning Notes on Voyager 2 Quick Look Data: Data after November 29, 2006]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''August 30, 2007''', ''Voyager 2'' passed the [[termination shock]] and then entered into the [[heliosheath]], approximately 1 billion miles (1.6 billion km) closer to the Sun than ''Voyager 1'' did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager-20071210.html|title=NASA - Voyager 2 Proves Solar System Is Squashed|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the [[interstellar magnetic field]] of deep space.

On '''April 22, 2010''', ''Voyager 2'' encountered scientific data format problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/05/06/nasa_working_on_voyager_2_data_problem/ |title=NASA working on Voyager 2 data problem |author=John Antczak |date=May 6, 2010 |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On '''May 17, 2010''', JPL engineers revealed that a flipped bit in an on-board computer had caused the issue, and scheduled a bit reset for May 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-151 |title=Engineers Diagnosing Voyager 2 Data System |publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |accessdate=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On '''May 23, 2010''', ''Voyager 2'' resumed sending science data from deep space after engineers fixed the flipped bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/NASA_Fixes_Bug_On_Voyager_2_999.html |title=NASA Fixes Bug On Voyager 2 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently research is being made into marking the area of memory with the flipped bit off limits or disallowing its use. The Low-Energy Charged Particle Instrument is currently operational, and data from this instrument concerning [[charged particles]] is being transmitted to Earth. This data permits measurements of the [[heliosheath]] and [[termination shock]]. There has also been a modification to the on-board flight software to delay turning off the AP Branch 2 backup heater for one year. It was scheduled to go off February 2, 2011 (DOY 033, 2011–033).
[[File:Voy2 8feb2012.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Simulated view of the position of ''Voyager 2'' as of February 8, 2012 showing spacecraft trajectory since launch]]
On '''July 25, 2012''', ''Voyager 2'' was traveling at 15.447&amp;nbsp;km/s relative to the [[Sun]] at about {{Convert|99.13|AU|km}} from the Sun,&lt;ref name="where"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/index.html |title=Where are the Voyagers? |date=September 9, 2012 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at −55.29° [[declination]] and 19.888 h [[right ascension]], and also at an ecliptic latitude of −34.0 degrees, placing it in the constellation [[Telescopium]] as observed from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.heavens-above.com/SolarEscape.aspx | title= Spacecraft escaping the Solar System | website=Heavens Above |author=Peat, Chris |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This location places it deep in the [[scattered disc]], and traveling outward at roughly 3.264 AU per year. It is more than twice as far from the Sun as [[Pluto]], and far beyond the [[periapsis|perihelion]] of [[90377 Sedna]], but not yet beyond the outer limits of the orbit of the [[Eris (dwarf planet)|dwarf planet Eris]].

On '''September 9, 2012''', ''Voyager 2'' was {{Convert|99.077|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth and {{Convert|99.504|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from the Sun; and traveling at {{Convert|15.436|km/s|mph|abbr=on}} (relative to the Sun) and traveling outward at about 3.256 AU per year.&lt;ref name="Peat-20120909"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peat |first=Chris |title=Spacecraft escaping the Solar System |url=https://www.heavens-above.com/SolarEscape.aspx |date=September 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Heavens-Above]] |accessdate=September 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunlight takes 13.73 hours to get to ''Voyager 2''. The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft is magnitude -16.7.&lt;ref name="Peat-20120909" /&gt; ''Voyager 2'' is heading in the direction of the constellation [[Telescopium (constellation)|Telescopium]].&lt;ref name="Peat-20120909" /&gt; (To compare, [[Proxima Centauri]], the closest star to the Sun, is about 4.2 [[light-year]]s (or {{val|2.65|e=5|u=AU}}) distant. ''Voyager 2's'' current relative velocity to the Sun is {{convert|15.436|km/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}. This calculates as 3.254 AU per year, about 10% slower than ''Voyager 1''. At this velocity, 81,438 years would pass before ''Voyager 2'' reaches the nearest star, [[Proxima Centauri]], were the spacecraft traveling in the direction of that star. (''Voyager 2'' will need about 19,390 years at its current velocity to travel a complete light year)

On '''November 7, 2012''', ''Voyager 2'' reached 100 AU from the sun, making it the third human-made object to reach 100 AU. ''Voyager 1'' was 122 AU from the Sun, and ''Pioneer 10'' is presumed to be at 107 AU. While Pioneer has ceased communications, both the ''Voyager'' spacecraft are performing well and are still communicating.

Neptune is 30.1 AU from the Sun; thus the edge of interstellar space is more than three times as far from the Sun as the last planet.]]

In 2013 ''Voyager 1'' was escaping the solar system at a speed of about 3.6 AU per year, while ''Voyager 2'' was only escaping at 3.3 AU per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/fastfacts.html|title=Voyager - Fast Facts|website=voyager.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Each year ''Voyager 1'' increases its lead over ''Voyager 2'')

By '''November 02, 2018''', ''Voyager 2'' was at a distance of {{Convert|119|AU|km|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} from the Sun.&lt;ref name="where"/&gt; There is a variation in distance from Earth caused by the Earth's revolution around the Sun relative to ''Voyager 2''.&lt;ref name="where"/&gt;

==Future of the probe==
It was originally thought that ''Voyager 2'' would enter interstellar space in early 2016, with its plasma spectrometer providing the first direct measurements of the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, the spacecraft may instead reach interstellar space sometime in 2019.  ''Voyager 2'' is not headed toward any particular star, although in roughly 40,000 years it should pass 1.7 light-years from the star [[Ross 248]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 22, 2007 |url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/interstellar.html |title=Voyager – Mission – Interstellar Mission |publisher=NASA | accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; And if undisturbed for [[Timeline of the far future#Spacecreaft and space exploration|296,000 years]], ''Voyager 2'' should pass by the star [[Sirius]] at a distance of 4.3 light-years.
