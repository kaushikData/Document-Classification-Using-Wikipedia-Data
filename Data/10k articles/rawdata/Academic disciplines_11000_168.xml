'''Acrodynia''' is a condition of [[Pain and nociception|pain]] and dusky pink discoloration in the hands and feet most often seen in children chronically exposed to [[heavy metals]], especially  [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].

The word ''acrodynia'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]], where ακρος means ''end'' or ''[[wiktionary:extremity|extremity]]'' and οδυνη means pain. As such, it might be (erroneously) used to indicate that a patient has pain in the hands or feet. However, acrodynia is a disease rather than a symptom.&lt;ref name=siblings&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horowitz Y, Greenberg D, Ling G, Lifshitz M | year = 2002 | title = Acrodynia: a case report of two siblings | url = | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 86 | issue = 6| page = 453 | doi = 10.1136/adc.86.6.453 | pmid = 12023189 | pmc=1762992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition is known by a large number of other names including '''pink disease''', '''hydrargyria''', '''mercurialism''', '''erythredema''', '''erythredema polyneuropathy''', '''Bilderbeck's''', '''Selter's''', '''Swift's''' and '''Swift-Feer disease'''.

==Symptoms==
Besides [[peripheral neuropathy]] (presenting as [[paresthesia]] or [[itching]], burning or [[Pain and nociception|pain]]) and discoloration, swelling ([[edema]]) and [[desquamation]] may occur.

Since mercury blocks the degradation pathway of [[catecholamines]], [[epinephrine]] excess causes profuse sweating ([[Diaphoresis|diaphora]]), [[tachycardia]], [[salivation]] and [[hypertension|elevated blood pressure]]. Mercury is suggested to inactivate [[S-adenosyl-methionine]], which is necessary for catecholamine [[catabolism]] by [[catechol-o-methyl transferase]].

Affected children may show red [[cheeks]] and [[nose]], red ([[erythema]]tous) [[lips]], loss of [[hair]], [[teeth]], and [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], transient rashes, [[hypotonia]] and [[photophobia]]. Other symptoms may include [[kidney]] dysfunction (e.g. [[Fanconi syndrome]]) or neuropsychiatric symptoms (emotional lability, [[memory]] impairment, [[insomnia]]).

Thus, the clinical presentation may resemble [[pheochromocytoma]] or [[Kawasaki disease]].

There is some evidence that the same mercury poisoning may predispose to [[Young's syndrome]] (men with [[bronchiectasis]] and [[low sperm count]]).&lt;ref name=hendry&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hendry WF, ((A'Hern FPA)), Cole PJ | year = 1993 | title = Was Young's syndrome caused by mercury exposure in childhood? | url = | journal = [[BMJ]] | volume = 307 | issue = 6919| pages = 1579–82 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.307.6919.1579 | pmid = 8292944 | pmc=1697782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Mercury compounds like [[calomel]] were historically used for various medical purposes: as [[laxative]]s, [[diuretics]], [[antiseptics]] or [[Antimicrobial|antimicrobial drugs]] for [[syphilis]], [[typhus]] and [[yellow fever]]&lt;ref name=beck&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beck C, Krafchik B, Traubici J, Jacobson S | year = 2004 | title = Mercury intoxication: it still exists | url = | journal = Pediatr Dermatol | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 254–9 | doi = 10.1111/j.0736-8046.2004.21314.x | pmid = 15165207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Teething powders were a widespread source of [[mercury poisoning]] until the recognition of mercury [[toxicity]] in the 1940s.

However, mercury poisoning and acrodynia still exist today.&lt;ref name=weinstein&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weinstein M, Bernstein S | year = 2003 | title = Pink ladies: mercury poisoning in twin girls | journal = CMAJ | volume = 168 | issue = 2| page = 201 | pmid = 12538551 | pmc=140434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sources of mercury intoxication include broken [[thermometers]].&lt;ref name=torres&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Torres AD, Rai AN, Hardiek ML|title=Mercury intoxication and arterial hypertension: report of two patients and review of the literature|journal=Pediatrics|date=2000|volume=105|issue=3|pages=E34|pmid=10699136|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/105/3/e34.long|doi=10.1542/peds.105.3.e34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Removal of the inciting agent is the goal of treatment. Correcting fluid and electrolyte losses and rectifying any nutritional imbalances (vitamin-rich diets, vitamin-B complex) are of utmost importance in the treatment of the disease.

The chelating agent meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid has been shown to be the preferred treatment modality. It can almost completely prevent methylmercury uptake by erythrocytes and hepatocytes.

In the past, dimercaprol (British antilewisite; 2,3-dimer-capto-l-propanol) and D-penicillamine were the most popular treatment modalities. Disodium edetate (Versene) was also used. Neither disodium edetate nor British antilewisite has proven reliable. British antilewisite has now been shown to increase CNS levels and exacerbate toxicity. N -acetyl-penicillamine has been successfully given to patients with mercury-induced neuropathies and chronic toxicity, although it is not approved for such uses. It has a less favorable adverse effect profile than meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid. [13]

Hemodialysis with and without the addition of L-cysteine as a chelating agent has been used in some patients experiencing acute renal failure from mercury toxicity.

Peritoneal dialysis and plasma exchange also may be of benefit.

Tolazoline (Priscoline) has been shown to offer symptomatic relief from sympathetic overactivity.

Antibiotics are necessary when massive hyperhidrosis, which may rapidly lead to miliaria rubra, is present. This can easily progress to bacterial secondary infection with a tendency for ulcerating pyoderma.

==Therapy==
The [[standard of care]] is discontinuation of the environmental exposure, and [[chelation]] therapy done safely with the Andrew Cutler Protocol, DMPS/DMSA and ALA taken orally in small doses according to their half-lives over a 72 hour period, followed by a three day break.

'''Alvéole''' is a French company based in Paris and founded in 2010 by Quattrocento&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/quattrocento-leve-5-2-millions-d-euros-pour-developper-des-medtechs.N402482|title=Quattrocento lève 5,2 millions d'euros pour développer des medtechs.|last=Arnaud,|first=Dumas|date=July 16, 2016|work=L'USINE NOUVELLE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a business accelerator company in the life science field, in collaboration with researchers from the [[French National Center for Scientific Research]] with expertise in [[bioengineering]] and cell imaging.

Alvéole is specialized in the development of devices for controlling microenvironment ''in vitro''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://labiotech.eu/micropatterning-cells/|title=Here’s a Flashy New Technique to Model Disease|last=|first=|date=October 26, 2017|work=Labiotech.eu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its first product is PRIMO: a contactless and maskless photopatterning device allowing researchers to control the [[topography]] (via [[microfabrication]]) and [[biochemistry]] (via [[micropatterning]]) of cell [[Microenvironment (biology)|microenvironment]].

== Products ==
Alvéole's first product is PRIMO, a photopatterning device which can be docked on standard [[Inverted microscope|inverted microscopes]]. PRIMO photopatterning technique is based on LIMAP technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strale|first=Pierre-Olivier|last2=Azioune|first2=Ammar|last3=Bugnicourt|first3=Ghislain|last4=Lecomte|first4=Yohan|last5=Chahid|first5=Makhlad|last6=Studer|first6=Vincent|date=2015-12-21|title=Multiprotein Printing by Light-Induced Molecular Adsorption|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201504154|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=28|issue=10|pages=2024–2029|doi=10.1002/adma.201504154|issn=0935-9648}}&lt;/ref&gt; and combines a maskless and contactless [[photolithography]] system controlled by a dedicated software (Leonardo) and a specific photo-initiator (PLPP). This system modulate UV-light illumination through an array of micromirrors ([[Digital micromirror device|DMD]]). The UV light is then projected through the objective of the microscope onto the substrate in order to either perform microfabrication or protein micropatterning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pierre-Olivier Strale, Matthieu Opitz, Marie-Charlotte Manus, Grégoire Peyret, Aurélien Duboin, Louise Bonnemay, Josselin Ruaudel|first=|date=May 2018|title=Controlling the topography and biochemistry of cell culture substrates with PRIMO® photopatterning system|url=|journal=Nature Methods|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

- [[Microfabrication]]: The modulated UV light is projected on a photosensitive resist. The cured [[photoresist]] can then be used as a mold to deposit [[Polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]] and generate microstructured PDMS chips.

- Protein [[micropatterning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nanoscalelabs.com/micropatterning.html|title=Micropatterning|last=|first=|date=2017|website=nanoscaleLABS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: The modulated UV light is projected onto a standard cell culture [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] previously coated with an anti-fouling polymer and reacts with the PLPP photo-initiator to locally degrade this coating. [[Adhesion protein]]s can then be adsorbed on the illuminated area only, allowing for the creation of proteins micropatterns on which cells can adhere.

== Applications ==
By [[micropatterning]] [[Adhesion protein|adhesions proteins]] with a sub-cellular resolution, PRIMO enables to control [[Cell adhesion|cell adhesio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n and isolate single cells under highly reproducible conditions. This allows cell biology researchers from various fields – such as [[mechanobiology]], [[toxicology]], [[immunology]], [[oncology]] or [[neuroscience]]s – to control or study intracellular mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delépine|first=Chloé|last2=Meziane|first2=Hamid|last3=Nectoux|first3=Juliette|last4=Opitz|first4=Matthieu|last5=Smith|first5=Amos B.|last6=Ballatore|first6=Carlo|last7=Saillour|first7=Yoann|last8=Bennaceur-Griscelli|first8=Annelise|last9=Chang|first9=Qiang|date=2015-11-24|title=Altered microtubule dynamics and vesicular transport in mouse and human MeCP2-deficient astrocytes|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddv464|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=146–157|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddv464|issn=0964-6906|pmc=4690499|pmid=26604147}}&lt;/ref&gt; or screen the effect of molecules on cell functions.

On a larger scale, PRIMO also makes it possible to control complex cellular arrangements, to study [[cell migration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/51002/title/Image-of-the-Day--Cell-Dance-/|title=Image of the Day: Cell Dance|last=|first=|date=November 24, 2017|work=The Scientist|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[axon guidance]].

Furthermore,the micropatterning process with PRIMO can be performed on microstructures' sides, top or bottom, making it possible to confine single cells or multicellular arrangements in three-dimension&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Stoecklin|first=Celine|last2=Yue|first2=Zhang|last3=Chen|first3=Wilhelm W.|last4=Mets|first4=Richard de|last5=Fong|first5=Eileen|last6=Studer|first6=Vincent|last7=Viasnoff|first7=Virgile|date=2018-03-28|title=A new approach to design artificial 3D micro-niches with combined chemical, topographical and rheological cues|biorxiv=291104}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One last known possible application is the [[photopolymerization]] of photo-sensitive materials, such as resins for microfabrication or photosensitive hydrogel to include [[rheological]] cues in cell microenvironment&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or to create permeable membranes in microfluidic channels&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Decock|first=Jérémy|last2=Schlenk|first2=Mathias|last3=Salmon|first3=Jean-Baptiste|date=2018|title=In situ photo-patterning of pressure-resistant hydrogel membranes with controlled permeabilities in PEGDA microfluidic channels|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C7LC01342F|journal=Lab on a Chip|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1075–1083|doi=10.1039/c7lc01342f|issn=1473-0197}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10526">'''Asset-based community development''' ('''ABCD''') is a methodology for the [[sustainable development]] of communities based on their strengths and potentials. It involves assessing the resources, skills, and experience available in a community; organizing the community around issues that move its members into action; and then determining and taking appropriate action.&lt;ref name=NUIPR&gt;{{cite report|last1=McKnight|first1=John|first2=John|last2=Kretzmann|title=Mapping Community Capacity|url=http://www.abcdinstitute.org/docs/MappingCapacity.pdf|publisher=Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research |location=Evanston, IL |format=PDF |edition=Revised |date=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} This method uses the community's own assets and resources as the basis for development; it empowers the people of the community by encouraging them to utilize what they already possess. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathie|first=Alison|last2=Cameron|first2=Jenny|last3=Gibson|first3=Katherine|title=Asset-based and citizen-led development: Using a diffracted power lens to analyze the possibilities and challenges|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1464993416674302|journal=Progress in Development Studies|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=54–66|doi=10.1177/1464993416674302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABCD approach was developed by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann at the Institute for Policy Research at [[Northwestern University]] in Evanston, Illinois.  They co-authored a book in 1993, ''Building Communities from the Inside Out: A Path Toward Finding and Mobilizing A Community’s Assets'',&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out"/&gt; which outlined their asset-based approach to [[community development]].&lt;ref name="ABCD Institute Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset-Based Community Development Institute|url=http://www.abcdinstitute.org/|publisher=Northwestern University Center for Civic Engagement |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Community Development Program at Northwestern University’s Institute for Policy Research  established the Asset-Based Community Development Institute based on three decades of research and community work by John P. Kretzmann and John L. McKnight.

==Principles==
Whereas needs-based community development emphasizes local deficits and looks to outside agencies for resources, asset-based community development focuses on honing and leveraging existing strengths within the community.&lt;ref name="Neighborhood Transformation"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Stan |last1=Rowland |date=26 April 2008 |title=What is Asset Based Community Development (ABCD) |url=http://www.neighborhoodtransformation.net/pdfs/What_%20is_Asset_Based_Community_Development.pdf |format=PDF |website=Collaborative of Neighborhood Transformation |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Related to tenets of [[empowerment]], it postulates that solutions to community problems already exist within a community’s assets. Principles that guide ABCD include:
* ''Everyone has gifts'': Each person in a community has something to contribute.
* ''Relationships build a community'': People must be connected in order for sustainable community development to take place.
* ''Citizens at the center'': Citizens should be viewed as actors—not recipients—in development.
* ''Leaders involve others'': Community development is strongest when it involves a broad base of community action.
* ''People care'': Challenge notions of "apathy" by listening to people's interests.
* ''Listen'': Decisions should come from conversations where people are heard.
* ''Ask'': Asking for ideas is more sustainable than giving solutions.
* ''Inside-out organization'': Local community members are in control.
* ''Institutions serve the community'': Institutional leaders should create opportunities for community-member involvement, then "step back."&lt;ref name="Neighborhood Transformation"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

== Tools ==
The ABCD approach utilizes several tools to assess and mobilize communities.&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kretzmann|first1=John|last2=McKnight|first2=John|title=Building Communities From the Inside Out: A Path Toward Finding and Mobilizing a Community's Assets|date=1993|publisher=ACTA Publications|location=Chicago, IL|page=14|edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-87946-108-9 |oclc=36708153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capacity inventory===

# ''Skills Information'': lists the many skills that a person has gained at home, work, in the community, or elsewhere.  Examples of these skills can include internet knowledge, hair'''-'''cutting, listening, wallpapering, carpentry, sewing, babysitting, etc.&lt;ref name="The Abundant Community"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKnight|first1=John|last2=Block|first2=Peter|author2-link=Peter Block|title=The Abundant Community: Awakening the Power of Families and Neighborhoods|date=2010|publisher=Berrett-Koehler|location=San Francisco, CA|edition=1st |isbn=978-1-60509-584-4 |oclc=876604904}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Community Skills'': lists the community work in which a person has participated to determine future work they may be interested in.
# ''Enterprising Interests and Experience'': lists past experience in business and determines interest in starting a business.
# ''Personal Information'': lists minimum information for follow-up.

===Asset mapping===
There are five key assets in any given community: individuals, associations, institutions, physical assets, and connections.&lt;ref name="What is ABCD Toolkit"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Asset-based community development (ABCD)|url=http://www.abcdinstitute.org/docs/What%20isAssetBasedCommunityDevelopment(1)(3).pdf|website=ABCD Institute|publisher=Collaborative for Neighborhood Transformation|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These assets are broken down into three categories: Gifts of individuals, Citizens’ Associations, and Local Institutions.&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out" /&gt;   Asset maps are used in lieu of needs maps which focus solely on negative aspects of communities.  Asset maps, on the other hand, focus on community assets, abilities, skills, and strengths in order to build its future.

[[Time banks]] are an example of using community assets to connect individuals' assets to one another.&lt;ref name=TimeBanks&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Timebanking? |url=http://timebanks.org/what-is-timebanking/ |website=TimeBanks |publisher=TimeBanks USA |accessdate=22 February 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221100136/http://timebanks.org/what-is-timebanking/ |archive-date=2015-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors and local organizations share skills with one another and earn and spend ‘TimeBank Hours’ or ‘credits’ in the process, allowing an hour of child care to equal an hour of home repair or tax preparation.&lt;ref name=TimeBanks/&gt;

==Ethics==
Since ABCD relies on existing community assets to create change, it has been criticized for implying that disadvantaged communities have all the resources they need to solve community problems.&lt;ref name="Australian Social Work"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ennis|first1=G.|last2=West|first2=Deborah|title=Exploring the potential of social network analysis in asset-based community development practice and research|journal=Australian Social Work|date=2010|volume=64|issue=4|pages=404–417|doi=10.1080/0312407X.2010.508167}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ABCD Institute, however, ABCD methodology recognizes that systemic injustice may require disadvantaged communities to seek assistance from outside the community. ABCD maintains that interventions from exterior sources will be most effective when a community’s assets are leveraged at full capacity.&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out" /&gt;
ABCD is described as a more sustainable model of community development than needs-based community development, because needs-based approaches may perpetuate community problems by emphasizing deficiencies and the necessity for reliance on outside assistance. By contrast, ABCD aims to build capacity within communities by expanding their [[social capital]].&lt;ref name="Building Communities from the Inside Out" /&gt; By working with outside resources and simultaneously building trust within the community, more members can make use of a wider array of strengths.&lt;ref name="Development in Practice"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathie|first1=Alison|last2=Cunningham|first2=Gord|title=From clients to citizens: Asset-based Community Development as a strategy for community-driven development|journal=Development in Practice|date=2003|volume=13|issue=5|pages=474-486|doi=10.1080/0961452032000125857}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|480}}

[[File:Perilsofpauline.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1914 ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|Perils of Pauline]]'', which popularized the term '''cliffhanger''' in the medium of film.]]

A '''cliffhanger''', or '''cliffhanger ending''', is a [[plot device]] in [[fiction]] which features a main character in a precarious or difficult dilemma, or confronted with a shocking revelation at the end of an episode&lt;ref&gt;Some are placed before commercial breaks&lt;/ref&gt; of serialized fiction. A cliffhanger is hoped to ensure the audience will return to see how the characters resolve the dilemma.

Some serials end with the caveat "To Be Continued…" or "The End?"  In [[movie serials]] and [[television series]], the following episode sometimes begins with a [[recap sequence]].

==History==
The cliffhanger plot device dates back to the famous medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary]] work, the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. The [[framing device]] has [[Scheherazade]] narrating a [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|series of stories]] to King [[Shahryār]] for 1,001 nights, with each night ending on a cliffhanger, in order to save herself from execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire.|date=2009|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=1438119062|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXyyYs2cRDcC&amp;pg=PT292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444351729|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8tPlht9lyAC&amp;pg=PT86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers later appeared as an element of the Victorian [[serial (literature)|serial novel]] that emerged in the 1840s, with many associating the form with [[Charles Dickens]], a pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction.&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;{{cite news|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|publisher=The New Yorker|date=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040341/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"&gt;Grossman, Jonathan H. (2012). Charles Dickens's Networks: Public Transport and the Novel. p. 54. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s it had become a staple part of the sensation serials, while the term itself originated with [[Thomas Hardy]] in 1873 when a protagonist from one of his serials, Henry Knight, was left hanging off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Hardy"/&gt;

===Victorian serials and term origin===

Cliffhangers became prominent with the serial publication of narrative fiction, pioneered by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"/&gt; Printed episodically in magazines, Dickens’s cliffhangers triggered desperation in his readers. Writing in the ''New Yorker'', Emily Nussbaum captured the anticipation of those waiting for the next installment of Dickens' ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'';

{{quote|In 1841, Dickens fanboys rioted on the dock of New York Harbor, as they waited for a British ship carrying the next installment, screaming, “Is little Nell dead?.&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;}} 

The impact of Dickens' serial publications saw the cliffhanger become a staple part of the sensation serials by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rob (2014). "Serialization in Popular Culture". p. 41. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cliffhanger" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'' (which was published in ''[[William Tinsley (publisher)|Tinsley's Magazine]]'' between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left hanging off a [[cliff]].&lt;ref name="Hardy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diniejko,|first1=Andrzej|title=Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes As a Cliffhanger with a Post-Darwinian Message|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=27 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032925/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serial media==
Cliffhangers were especially popular in 1920s and 1930s [[Serial film|serials]] when [[movie theater]]s filled the cultural [[niche market|niche]] later primarily occupied by [[television]]. Cliffhangers are often used in [[television series]], especially [[soap opera]]s that end each episode on a cliffhanger. Prior to the early 1980s, season-ending cliffhangers were rare on U.S. television. The first such season-ender on U.S. TV was in the [[comedy]] send-up of soap operas ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' in 1978. Several [[Australia]]n [[soap opera]]s, which went off air over summer, such as ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', ''[[The Restless Years]]'', and ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', ended each year with major and much publicized catastrophe, such as a character being shot in the final seconds of the year's closing episode.

Cliffhangers are commonly used in Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In contrast to American [[superhero comics]], Japanese manga are much more frequently written with cliffhangers, often with each volume or issue. This is particularly the case with [[shōnen manga]], especially those published by ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', such as ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Shaman King]]'', and ''[[One Piece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mylonas|first1=Eric|title=Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors|date=2004|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0761546758|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHxLR1C8JBEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brandweek, Volume 47|journal=[[Brandweek]]|date=January 2006|volume=47|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bplaAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Adweek L.P.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its original run, [[Doctor Who]] was written in a serialised format that usually ended each episode within a serial on a cliffhanger. In the first few years of the show, the final episodes of each serial would have a cliffhanger that would lead into the next serial. [[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire Part One]] is notable for having a cliffhanger that involved [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] literally hanging from a cliff. This has been frequently criticised by fans for being a pointless cliffhanger, but script editor [[Andrew Cartmel]] gave an explanation for the reasoning of it in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|title=A Brief History Of Time (Travel): Dragonfire|author=|date=|website=www.shannonsullivan.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910200758/http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|archivedate=2015-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers were rare on American television before 1980, as television networks preferred the flexibility of airing episodes in any order. The phenomenal success of the 1980 "[[Who shot J.R.?]]" third season-ending cliffhanger of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', and the "[[Who Done It (Dallas)|Who Done It]]" fourth-season episode that finally solved the mystery, contributed to the cliffhanger becoming a common storytelling device on television.&lt;ref name="meisler19950507"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/arts/television-when-j-r-was-shot-the-cliffhanger-was-born.html?pagewanted=all | title=TELEVISION; When J. R.

The two main ways for cliffhangers to keep readers/viewers coming back is to either involve characters in a suspenseful, possibly life-threatening situation, or to feature a sudden shocking revelation. Cliffhangers are also used to leave open the possibility of a character being killed off due to the actor not continuing to play the role.

Cliffhangers are also sometimes deliberately inserted by writers who are uncertain whether a new series or season will be commissioned, in the hope that viewers will demand to know how the situation is resolved. Such was the case with the second season of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', which ended in a cliffhanger similar to the first season with a high degree of uncertainty about the fate of the protagonist, but the cliffhanger could not save the show from being canceled, resulting in the unresolved ending.

The cliffhanger has become a genre staple (especially in comics, due to the multi-part storylines becoming the norm instead of self-contained stories). To such a degree, in fact, that series writers no longer feel they have to be immediately resolved, or even referenced, when the next episode is shown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |title=The IT Crowd: Tramps Like Us |publisher=Noise to Signal |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311215959/http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; variously because the writer didn't feel it was "a strong enough opener,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |title=…and we like tramps! « Why, That\’s Delightful! |publisher=Whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324010610/http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "couldn't be bothered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Falk |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/1014/1014434_one_of_the_it_crowd.html |title=One of the IT Crowd &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News - menmedia.co.uk |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavily serialized television drama ''[[True Blood]]'' has become notorious for cliffhangers. Not only do the seasons conclude with cliffhangers, but almost every episode finishes at a cliffhanger directly after or during a highly dramatic moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |title='True Blood' Finale Sets Up More Cliffhangers |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020081054/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commercial break]]s can be a nuisance to [[screenwriter|script writer]]s because some sort of incompleteness or minor cliffhanger should be provided before each to stop the viewer from changing channels during the commercial break. Sometimes a series ends with an unintended cliffhanger caused by a very abrupt ending without a satisfactory [[dénouement]], but merely assuming that the viewer will assume that everything sorted itself out.

Sometimes a movie, book, or season of a television show will end with the defeat of the main villain before a second, evidently more powerful villain makes a brief appearance (becoming the villain of the next film). Occasionally an element other than a villain is also used to tease at a sequel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8640">[[Image:Collimator2.svg|thumb|In the lower picture, the light has been collimated.]]
A '''collimated beam''' of [[light]] has parallel [[ray (optics)|rays]], and therefore will spread minimally as it propagates. A perfectly collimated [[light beam]], with no [[beam divergence|divergence]], would not disperse with distance. Such a beam cannot be created, due to [[diffraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://file.lasersaur.com/docs-thirdparty/Lasers.pdf |title=Melles Griot Catalog |chapter=Introduction to Laser Technology |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--&gt; |page=36.6 |date=n.d. |publisher=Melles Griot |access-date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Light can be approximately collimated by a number of processes, for instance by means of a [[collimator]]. Perfectly collimated light is sometimes said to be ''focused at infinity''. Thus, as the distance from a point source increases, the spherical [[wavefront]]s become flatter and closer to [[plane wave]]s, which are perfectly collimated.

==Etymology==
The word "collimate" comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''collimare'', which originated in a misreading of ''collineare'', "to direct in a straight line".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|first=Charlton T. |last=Lewis|first2=Charles|last2=Short|location=Oxford; Medford|publisher=Clarendon Press; Perseus Digital Library|year=2010|origyear=1879|title=collimo|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=collimo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
===Lasers===
[[Laser]] light from gas or crystal lasers is highly collimated because it is formed in an [[optical cavity]] between two parallel [[mirror]]s which constrain the light to a path perpendicular to the surfaces of the mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldoflasers.com/laserproperties.htm |title=Properties of Lasers |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=World of Lasers |publisher=World of Lasers |access-date=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, gas lasers can use concave mirrors, flat mirrors, or a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joshi |date=2010 |title=Engineering Physics |publisher=[[Tata McGraw-Hill Education]] |page=517 |isbn=9780070704770 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Engineering Physics 1: For WBUT |location=India |publisher=Pearson Education India |pages=3–9 |date=n.d. |isbn=9788131755938 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=Paul |date=1992 |title=Elementary Modern Physics |publisher=MacMillan |page=149 |isbn=9780879015695 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The divergence of high-quality laser beams is commonly less than 1 [[milliradian]], and can be much less for large-diameter beams. [[Laser diode]]s emit less-collimated light due to their short cavity, and therefore higher collimation requires a collimating lens.

===Synchrotron light===
[[Synchrotron light]] is very well collimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winick |first=Herman |last2=Doniach |first2=S |date=2012 |title=Synchrotron Radiation Research |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |page=567 |isbn=9781461579984 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by bending relativistic electrons (i.e. those moving at [[Special relativity|relativistic]] speeds) around a circular track. When the electrons are at relativistic speeds, the resulting radiation is highly collimated, a result which does not occur at lower speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mobilio |first=Settimio |last2=Boscherini |first2=Federico |last3=Meneghini |first3=Carlo |date=2014 |title=Synchrotron Radiation: Basics, Methods, and Applications |publisher=Springer |page=31 |isbn=9783642553158 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distant sources===
The light from [[star]]s (other than the [[Sun]]) arrives at Earth precisely collimated, because stars are so far away they present no detectable angular size. However, due to refraction and turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere, starlight arrives slightly uncollimated at the ground with an [[astronomical seeing|apparent angular diameter of about 0.4 arcseconds]]. Direct rays of light from the Sun arrive at the Earth uncollimated by one-half degree, this being the [[angular diameter]] of the Sun as seen from Earth.  During a [[solar eclipse]], the Sun's light becomes increasingly collimated as the visible surface shrinks to a thin crescent and ultimately a [[Baily's beads|small point]], producing the phenomena of distinct shadows and [[shadow bands]].

===Lenses and mirrors===
[[Image:CollimatingLensSVG.svg|thumb|150px|right|An example of an optical collimating lens.]]A perfect [[parabolic mirror]] will bring parallel rays to a focus at a single point. Conversely, a point source at the focus of a parabolic mirror will produce a beam of collimated light creating a [[Collimator]]. Since the source needs to be small, such an optical system cannot produce much optical power. [[Spherical mirror]]s are easier to make than parabolic mirrors and they are often used to produce approximately collimated light. Many types of [[lens (optics)|lens]]es can also produce collimated light from point-like sources.

===Display system in flight simulators that uses collimated light===
[[File:Collimated display from side.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of a collimated-light display system, as seen from the side of a flight simulator]]
This principle is used in [[full flight simulator]]s (FFS), that have specially designed systems for displaying imagery of the Out-The-Window (OTW) scene to the pilots in the replica aircraft cabin.

In aircraft where two pilots are seated side by side, if the OTW imagery were projected in front of the pilots on a screen, one pilot would see the correct view but the other would see a view where some objects in the scene would be at incorrect angles.
[[File:Collimation - diagram and real sim.jpg|300px|right|Diagram of display system that uses collimated light and a real flight simulator]]
To avoid this, collimated optics are used in the simulator visual display system so that the OTW scene is seen by both pilots at a distant focus rather than at the focal distance of a projection screen.  This is achieved through an optical system that allows the imagery to be seen by the pilots in a mirror that has a vertical curvature, the curvature enabling the image to be seen at a distant focus by both pilots, who then see essentially the same OTW scene without any distortions. Since the light arriving at the eye point of both pilots is from different angles to the field of view of the pilots due to different projection systems arranged in a semi-circle above the pilots, the entire display system cannot be considered a collimated display, but a display system that uses collimated light.

==Collimation and decollimation==
"Collimation" refers to all the optical elements in an instrument being on their designed [[optical axis]]. It also refers to the process
of adjusting an optical instrument so that all its elements are on that designed axis (in line and parallel). With regards to a telescope, the term refers to the fact that the optical axis of each optical component should be centered and parallel, so that collimated light emerges from the eyepiece. Most amateur reflector telescopes need to be re-collimated every few years to maintain optimum performance. This can be done by simple visual methods such as looking down the optical assembly with no eyepiece to make sure the components are lined up, by using a [[Cheshire eyepiece]], or with the assistance of a simple laser collimator or [[autocollimator]]. Collimation can also be tested using a [[Shearing Interferometer|shearing interferometer]], which is often used to test laser collimation.

"Decollimation" is any mechanism or process which causes a beam with the minimum possible [[ray (optics)|ray]] divergence to diverge or converge from parallelism. Decollimation may be deliberate for systems reasons, or may be caused by many factors, such as [[refractive index]] inhomogeneities, occlusions, [[scattering]], [[Deflection (physics)|deflection]], [[diffraction]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], and [[refraction]]. Decollimation must be accounted for to fully treat many systems such as [[radio]], [[radar]], [[sonar]], and optical [[Telecommunication|communications]].

A '''comic book''' or '''comicbook''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw!]], Mike Kazaleh, "Secret Agent Orange," ''Annoying Orange'' #1, New York: Papercutz, December 2012, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''comic magazine''' or simply '''comic''', is a publication that consists of [[comic]] art in the form of sequential juxtaposed [[panel (comics)|panels]] that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in [[word balloon]]s emblematic of the comics art form. Although {{not a typo|comics has}} some origins in [[18th century]] [[Japan]], comic books were first popularized in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor [[comic strip]]s, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html A History of the Comic Book]. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''comic book'' derives from [[American comic book]]s once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the [[manga]] market in Japan was valued at {{JPY|586.4 billion|link=yes}} ({{US$|6{{ndash}}7 billion|long=no|link=yes}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schodt|first=Frederik|authorlink=Frederik L.

==Structure==
Comic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.
&lt;!--

Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==American comic books==
{{main|American comic book}}
Comics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in 1842 in hardcover,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/collections/books/ocn259708589/ocn259708589.html ''The Adventures of M. Obadiah Oldbuck''] at the [[Dartmouth College]] library&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing [[Dell Publishing]]'s 36-page ''Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics'' as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it "the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing".&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ron Goulart | last=Goulart | first=Ron | title = Comic Book Encyclopedia| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Entertainment]] | location=New York| year= 2004 | isbn=978-0060538163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s [[Superman]] in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goulart | first=Ron | authorlink=Ron Goulart | title=Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History | date= 2000 | publisher=Collectors Press | page=43 | isbn=978-1-888054-38-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ushered the [[Golden Age of Comics]]. The Golden Age originated the [[archetype]] of the [[superhero]].According to historian [[Michael A. Amundson]], appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeman|first1=Scott C.|last2=Amundson|first2=Michael A.|title=Atomic Culture: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=9780870817632|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-golden-age-of-comics/ | title= The Golden Age of Comics | work = History Detectives: Special Investigations | publisher = [[PBS]] | accessdate= February 18, 2015| quote= The precise era of the Golden Age is disputed, though most agree that it was born with the launch of Superman in 1938.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silver Age of comic books]] is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''  #4 (Oct. 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | title=DC Flashback: The Flash | accessdate=27 June 2008 | last=CBR News Team | date=2 July 2007 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65JDtF5cz?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | archivedate=8 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706  | title=Breaking the Border – Rants and Ramblings | accessdate=5 January 2010 | last=Zicari | first=Anthony | date=3 August 2007 | publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070826092448/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706 |archivedate = 26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time [[Marvel Comics]] revolutionized the medium with such [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] superheroes as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fantastic Four]] and Lee and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]]. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=libraries&gt;{{cite book | title=Comic Book Collections for Libraries | publisher=Libraries Unlimited | first=Bryan D. |last=Fagan  |first2= Jody Condit| last2= Condit | isbn=  978-1598845112 | year=2011| page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]] | year=2008 |volume=38| page= 1028 | chapter = Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s criticisms of the medium in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), which prompted the American [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jeffrey|title=Comic Book Fandom and Cultural Capital|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=1997|volume=30|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMAA instilled the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comic book fandom and cultural capital|last = Brown|first = Jeffrey|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Popular Culture|doi = 10.1111/j.0022-3840.1997.3004_13.x|pmid = |access-date = |issn = 0022-3840|volume = 30|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.

===   Underground comic books   ===
{{Main|Underground comix}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as [[underground comix]]. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure "[[Tijuana bibles]]". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]].

[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,&lt;ref name="Shelton"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=9 | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1-56097-780-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"/&gt; has been credited as the first underground comic;&lt;ref name="Shelton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1-56025-572-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[R. Crumb]] and the crew of cartoonists who worked on ''[[Zap Comix]]'' popularized the form.

===Alternative comics===
{{Main|Alternative comics}}

The rise of comic book [[specialty store]]s in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for "independent" or "[[alternative comics]]" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].

During the 1970s the "[[small press]]" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].

A number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The "[[minicomic]]s" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

Small publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].

===Graphic novels===
[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]
{{Main|Graphic novel}}
In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term "graphic novel".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger. ''Adult Comics: An Introduction''(Routledge New Accents Library Collection, 2005), p. 291 {{ISBN|978-0-415-29139-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-29139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Lynd Ward]] and others, including Stan Lee.
In 1950, [[St. John Publications]] produced the [[digest-sized]], adult-oriented "picture novel" ''[[It Rhymes with Lust]]'', a 128-page digest by [[pseudonym]]ous writer "Drake Waller" ([[Arnold Drake]] and [[Leslie Waller]]), penciler [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]] and inker [[Ray Osrin]], touted as "an original full-length novel" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist [[Gil Kane]] and collaborators devised the paperback "comics novel" ''[[Blackmark]]''. [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term "graphic novel" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work ''[[A Contract with God|A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' in 1978.

===Market size===
In 2017, the comic book market size for North America was just over $1 billion with digital sales being flat, book stores having a 1 percent decline, and comic book stores having a 10 percent decline over 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/industrywide/2017-industrywide.html |title=Comics and graphic novel sales down 6.5% in 2017 |work=Comichron |date=2018-07-13 |accessdate=2018-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic book collecting===
{{Main|Comic book collecting}}

The 1970s saw the advent of specialty [[comic book store]]s. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Comic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.

Some rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The "Pay Copy" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=818&amp;Lot_No=2020&amp;type=prte-pr091305a |title=Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 Pay Copy (First Funnies, Inc., 1939) CGC VF/NM 9.0 Cream to off-white pages. This is one of... Golden Age (1938–1955)Superhero |publisher=Comics.ha.com |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD {{as of|2010|December|lc=y}}, including two examples of [[Action Comics]] #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]],&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/26/news/economy/batman_comic/ Batman comic book beats Superman at auction, sets record] CNN Money 2-26-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/news/companies/comic-record/index.html Superman comic sells for record $3.2 million] (CNN Money) – 25 Auguest 2014&lt;/ref&gt; both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and [[Detective Comics]] #27, the first appearance of [[Batman]], via public auction.

Updating the above price obtained for ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]], the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Superman's Action Comics No. 1 sells for record $3.2 million on eBay|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/supermans-action-comics-no-1-sells-for-record-3-2-million-on-ebay|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Sentence fragment: Before [[Fawcett Comics]] introduced [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] --&gt;

Misprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen#Issue 5 recall|original press run]] of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' #5, which DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage [[Victorian era]] advertisement for "Marvel [[Douche]]", which the publisher considered offensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?article=2153 | publisher=Comic Book Resources | date=23 May 2005 | title=Alan's Previous Problems With DC (sidebar) | work=Lying in the Gutters | last=Johnston | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been [[Comics Guaranty LLC|CGC]] graded. (See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)

In 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to "slab" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. {{as of|2014||}}, there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as [http://comics.gocollect.com GoCollect] and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.

The original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.

When the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.

===Japanese manga===
{{Main|Manga}}

The first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as {{Nihongo|"red books"|赤本|akahon}}, {{Nihongo|"black books"|黒本|kurobon}}, and {{Nihongo|"blue books"|青本|aohon}}, these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book {{Nihongo|''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream''|金々先生栄花の夢|Kinkin sensei eiga no yume}}, an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the {{nihongo3|lit. ''yellow cover''|黄表紙|[[kibyōshi]]}}. Published in thousands of copies, the ''kibyōshi'' may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain [[Extant literature|extant]].

Modern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints {{Nihongo|''[[ukiyo-e]]''|浮世絵|}} with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term ''manga'' means "random (or whimsical) pictures", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as [[Santō Kyōden]]'s picturebook {{Nihongo|''Shiji no yukikai''|四時交加|}} (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's ''Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women'' (1798). During the [[Meiji period]], the term ''[[Akahon]]'' was also common.

Western artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in ''ukiyo-e'', as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as ''Ponchi-e'' (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or [[Yonkoma|four-picture format]].

Dr. [[Osamu Tezuka]] (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled {{Nihongo|''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]''|桃太郎　海の神兵|''Momotarō Umi no Shinpei''}} inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the ''ukiyo-e'' tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.

Though a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.

Manga magazines—also known as [[comics anthology|"anthologies"]]—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for [[List of manga series by volume count|many years]] if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called {{nihongo3|lit. ''stand-alone book''|単行本|[[tankōbon]]}}, the equivalent of the American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.

===Dōjinshi===

{{nihongo3|''fan magazine''|同人誌|Dōjinshi}}, [[fan-made]] Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American "underground comics" market; the largest dōjinshi fair, [[Comiket]], attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;Mizoguchi Akiko (2003).

===Korean manhwa===
{{Main|Manhwa}}

Korean manhwa have quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the [[Korean Wave]]. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.

===Webtoons===
{{Main|Webtoons}}

Webtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwaga]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.

{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}
[[File:René Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[René Goscinny]] (1926 – 1977), writer of the ''[[Astérix]]'' comic book series.]] 
France and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessinées'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone "Franco-Belgian" comics, but have their own distinct style.

The name ''bande dessinée'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as "the drawn strip"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word "bande" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms "comics" and "funnies", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvième art'' (literally, "the ninth art") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.

In France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.

Although ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. ''The Guardian'' refers to [[Ally Sloper]] as “one of the world’s first iconic cartoon characters”, and “as famous in Victorian Britain as [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]] would be a century later.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top hats off to Marie Duval, a lost Victorian cartoonist sensation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/oct/27/marie-duval-victorian-cartoonist-ally-sloper |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated [[penny dreadful]]s of the Victorian era (featuring [[Sweeney Todd]], [[Dick Turpin]] and ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'').&lt;ref name="histoday94"&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000228860 | title= Horror Comics: The Nasties of the 1950s | author= John Sringhall | work=[[History Today]]| issue= 7| volume= 44 | date=July 1994| publisher= [[Questia Online Library]]| accessdate=2010-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most popular British comic books, ''[[The Beano]]'' and ''[[The Dandy]]'', were first published by [[DC Thomson]] in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Stephen.

In 1954, ''[[Tiger (Fleetway)|Tiger]]'' comics introduced ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of [[Roy Race]] and the team he played for, [[Melchester Rovers]]. The stock media phrase "real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), "Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished. Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''2000 AD'' titles, have been published in a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] form. Underground comics and [[British small press comics|"small press"]] titles have also appeared in the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.

The content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.

In the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the "[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]]" in comic book history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/05/01/comics-unmasked-the-british-invasion | title= Comics Unmasked: The British invasion | author=  | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= Art Fund| accessdate=2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and "darker and edgier" comic books and jump start the [[Modern Age of Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://sequart.org/magazine/20743/1986-british-invasion-part-3-neil-gaiman-swamp-thing/ | title= The British Invasion, Part 3: Neil Gaiman &amp; Swamp Thing | author= Peter Sanderson | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= ''Sequart Organization''| accessdate=September 28, 2014 }} May 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Writers included [[Alan Moore]], famous for his ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', ''[[From Hell]]'', ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[Marvelman]]'', and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/ Please, Sir, I Want Some Moore / How Alan Moore transformed American comics], by Douglas Wolk in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], December, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Gaiman]] with ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' mythos and ''[[Books of Magic]]''; [[Warren Ellis]], creator of ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' and ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]''; and others such as [[Mark Millar]], creator of ''[[Wanted (comics)|Wanted]]'' and ''[[Kick-Ass (comic book)|Kick-Ass]]''.

At Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic [[Annual publication|annuals]], printed and bound as hardcover [[ISO 216#A series|A4]]-size books; [[Rupert Bear|"Rupert"]] supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. [[DC Thomson]] also repackages ''[[The Broons]]'' and ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.

In [[Italy]], comics (known in Italian as ''fumetti'') made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Guido Crepax]] exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as ''[[Diabolik]]'' or the ''[[Sergio Bonelli Editore|Bonelli]]'' line—namely ''[[Tex Willer]]'' or ''[[Dylan Dog]]''—remain best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/06/quanto-vendono-i-fumetti-bonelli-i-dati-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white [[digest size]] format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and [[Argentina]]. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of [[Walt Disney]] comic stories outside the U.S. [[Donald Duck]]'s superhero alter ego, [[Paperinik]], known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

===Czech comics===

''Čtyřlístek'' (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.

==Distribution==
Distribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The [[smartphone]] and the [[tablet computer|tablet]] have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.&lt;ref name=NYT72113&gt;{{cite news|title=Embracing Tablets, Comic Book Publishers Cash In on a Digital Revolution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/media/comic-books-cash-in-on-a-digital-revolution.html|accessdate=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2013|author=Gregory Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital distribution===
On November 13, 2007, [[Marvel Comics]] launched [[Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited]], a subscription service allowing readers to read many [[Digital comic|comics]] from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16781/avenging_spider-man_1_makes_digital_history|title=Avenging Spider-Man #1 Makes Digital History|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is [[comiXology]]. Some platforms, such as [[Graphicly]], have shut down.

== Comic collections in libraries ==
Many libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccgclibraries.com/integrating-comics-into-your-exhibits-and-collections/|title=» Integrating Comics Into Your Exhibits and Collections|website=ccgclibraries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest comic book ever published was on the 5th of August 2018 in São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. It is named ''[[Monica's Gang|Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!]]'' by [[Panini Comics|Panini Comics Brasil]] and [[Mauricio de Sousa|Mauricio de Sousa Editora]], and it measures at 69.9&amp;nbsp;cm by 99.8&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft 3.51 in by 3&amp;nbsp;ft 3.29 in).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-comic-book-published|title=Largest comic book published|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese manga author [[Eiichiro Oda]] has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the "Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". His widely popular comic titled [[One Piece]] was first serialised in [[Weekly Shonen Jump]] magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/6/japanese-manga-“one-piece”-is-most-printed-comic-series-by-one-author-ever-385868|title=Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An illustration of the dining philosophers problem.png|thumb|200px|The [[Dining philosophers problem|"Dining Philosophers"]], a classic problem involving concurrency and shared resources]]

In [[computer science]], '''concurrency''' refers to the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome.  This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems. In more technical terms, concurrency refers to the decomposability property of a program, algorithm, or problem into order-independent or partially-ordered components or units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamport|first1=Leslie|title=Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=July 1978|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/time-clocks.pdf|accessdate=4 February 2016|doi=10.1145/359545.359563}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including [[Petri net]]s, [[process calculi]], the [[parallel random-access machine]] model, the [[actor model]] and the [[Reo Coordination Language]].

== History ==
As [[Leslie Lamport]] (2015) notes, "While [[concurrent program]] execution had been considered for years, the computer science of concurrency began with [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s seminal 1965 paper that introduced the [[mutual exclusion]] problem. ... The ensuing decades have seen a huge growth of interest in concurrency—particularly in [[distributed system]]s. Looking back at the origins of the field, what stands out is the fundamental role played by Edsger Dijkstra".&lt;ref name="Lamport (2015)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/6/187316-turing-lecture-the-computer-science-of-concurrency/fulltext |author=[[Leslie Lamport|Lamport, Leslie]] |title=Turing Lecture: The Computer Science of Concurrency: The Early Years (Communications of the ACM, Vol. 58 No. 6, June 2015) |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |accessdate=22 Mar 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
Because computations in a concurrent system can interact with each other while being executed, the number of possible execution paths in the system can be extremely large, and the resulting outcome can be [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation|indeterminate]]. Concurrent use of shared [[Resource (computer science)|resources]] can be a source of indeterminacy leading to issues such as [[deadlock|deadlocks]], and [[resource starvation]].&lt;ref name="cleaveland1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cleaveland|first=Rance|author2=Scott Smolka|title=Strategic Directions in Concurrency Research|journal=ACM Computing Surveys|volume=28|issue=4|date=December 1996|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/242223.242252|pages=607|doi=10.1145/242223.242252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design of concurrent systems often entails finding reliable techniques for coordinating their execution, data exchange, [[memory allocation]], and execution scheduling to minimize [[latency (engineering)|response time]] and maximise [[throughput]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Colin | last1=Campbell | first2=Ralph | last2=Johnson | first3=Ade | last3=Miller | first4=Stephen | last4=Toub | title=Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff963542.aspx |date=August 2010 | publisher=Microsoft Press | isbn=978-0-7356-5159-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of academic disciplines]] --&gt;
Concurrency theory has been an active field of research in [[theoretical computer science]].  One of the first proposals was  [[Carl Adam Petri]]'s seminal work on [[Petri net]]s in the early 1960s. In the years since, a wide variety of formalisms have been developed for modeling and reasoning about concurrency.

=== Models ===
A number of formalisms for modeling and understanding concurrent systems have been developed, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Filman|first=Robert|author2=Daniel Friedman|title=Coordinated Computing -  Tools and Techniques for Distributed Software|year=1984|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-022439-0|url=http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/people/filman/text/dpl/dpl.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516135233/http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/people/filman/text/dpl/dpl.html|archivedate=2007-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[parallel random-access machine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jörg | last=Keller |author2=Christoph Keßler |author3=Jesper Träff   | title=Practical PRAM Programming | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[actor model]]
* Computational bridging models such as the [[bulk synchronous parallel]] (BSP) model
* [[Petri net]]s
* [[Process calculi]]
** [[Communicating sequential processes]] (CSP) model
* [[Tuple space]]s, e.g., [[Linda (coordination language)|Linda]]
* [[SCOOP (software)|Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming]] (SCOOP)
* [[Reo Coordination Language]]

Some of these models of concurrency are primarily intended to support reasoning and specification, while others can be used through the entire development cycle, including design, implementation, proof, testing and simulation of concurrent systems. Some of these are based on [[message passing]], while others have different mechanisms for concurrency.

The proliferation of different models of concurrency has motivated some researchers to develop ways to unify these different theoretical models. For example, Lee and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli have demonstrated that a so-called "tagged-signal" model can be used to provide a common framework for defining the [[denotational semantics]] of a variety of different models of concurrency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Edward|author2=Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli| title= A Framework for Comparing Models of Computation|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on CAD]]|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1217–1229|date=December 1998|doi=10.1109/43.736561}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Nielsen, Sassone, and Winskel have demonstrated that [[category theory]] can be used to provide a similar unified understanding of different models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author = Mogens Nielsen |author2=Vladimiro Sassone |author3=Glynn Winskel| title = Relationships Between Models of Concurrency |booktitle = REX School/Symposium|year = 1993|url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/article/nielsen94relationships.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Concurrency Representation Theorem in the actor model provides a fairly general way to represent concurrent systems that are closed in the sense that they do not receive communications from outside. (Other concurrency systems, e.g., [[process calculi]] can be modeled in the actor model using a [[two-phase commit protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Knabe. A Distributed Protocol for Channel-Based Communication with Choice PARLE 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) The mathematical denotation denoted by a closed system &lt;tt&gt;S&lt;/tt&gt; is constructed increasingly better approximations from an initial behavior called &lt;tt&gt;⊥&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; using a behavior approximating function &lt;tt&gt;'''progression'''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to construct a denotation (meaning ) for &lt;tt&gt;S&lt;/tt&gt; as follows:&lt;ref name="clinger1981"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=William Clinger|authorlink=William Clinger (computer scientist)|title=Foundations of Actor Semantics|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6935|publisher=MIT|version=Mathematics Doctoral Dissertation|date=June 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;tt&gt;'''Denote'''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ⊔&lt;sub&gt;i∈ω&lt;/sub&gt; '''progression'''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;(⊥&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;

In this way, &lt;tt&gt;S&lt;/tt&gt; can be mathematically characterized in terms of all its possible behaviors.

=== Logics ===
Various types of [[temporal logic]]&lt;ref name="stirling"&gt;{{cite book|first=Colin|last=Roscoe|title=Modal and Temporal Properties of Processes|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=0-387-98717-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to help reason about concurrent systems. Some of these logics, such as [[linear temporal logic]] and [[computation tree logic]], allow assertions to be made about the sequences of states that a concurrent system can pass through. Others, such as [[action computational tree logic]], [[Hennessy–Milner logic]], and [[Leslie Lamport|Lamport's]] [[temporal logic of actions]], build their assertions from sequences of ''actions'' (changes in state). The principal application of these logics is in writing specifications for concurrent systems.&lt;ref name="cleaveland1996"/&gt;

== Practice ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2007}}
[[Concurrent programming]] encompasses programming languages and algorithms used to implement concurrent systems.  Concurrent programming is usually considered to be more general than [[parallel programming]] because it can involve arbitrary and dynamic patterns of communication and interaction, whereas parallel systems generally have a predefined and well-structured communications pattern. The base goals of concurrent programming include ''correctness'', ''performance'' and ''robustness''. Concurrent systems such as [[Operating system]]s and [[Database management system]]s are generally designed to operate indefinitely, including automatic recovery from failure, and not terminate unexpectedly (see [[Concurrency control]]). Some concurrent systems implement a form of transparent concurrency, in which concurrent computational entities may compete for and share a single resource, but the complexities of this competition and sharing are shielded from the programmer.

Because they use shared resources, concurrent systems in general require the inclusion of some kind of [[Arbiter (electronics)|arbiter]] somewhere in their implementation (often in the underlying hardware), to control access to those resources. The use of arbiters introduces the possibility of [[indeterminacy in concurrent computation]] which has major implications for practice including correctness and performance.  For example, arbitration introduces [[unbounded nondeterminism]] which raises issues with [[model checking]] because it causes explosion in the state space and can even cause models to have an infinite number of states.

Some concurrent programming models include [[coprocess]]es and [[deterministic concurrency]]. In these models, threads of control explicitly [[Yield (multithreading)|yield]] their timeslices, either to the system or to another process.

A '''culmicole''' is an [[organism]] that lives on the apexes of [[grass]] [[leaves]] and stems. An example of a culmicole are [[species]] of [[planthopper]]s, which spend their lives perched on grass blades. The name was first coined by Lincoln et al. in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Animal Behavior Desk Reference: A Dictionary of Animal Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution| last=Barrows| first=Edward| year=2001| publisher=CRC Press| page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Aldrich Dictionary of Phobias and Other Word Families|first=Chris|last=Aldrich|publisher=Trafford Publishing|date=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7iDw172KBcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=18|isbn=9781553698869}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''economics of open data''' refers to the production, or loss, of wealth related to the use of [[open data]]. The cost of open data is a primary concern that can deter governments any companies from the opening up of data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The data revolution: big data, open data, data infrastructures &amp; their consequences|last=Kitchen|first=Rob|publisher=Sage|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=57|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While open data may theoretically have a low production cost, the cost of creating the original data set as well as maintaining that data once it is produced can be expensive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the creation of data may be expensive governments around the world such as France, the United States, and Japan, are anticipating substantial economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takagi|first=Soichiro|date=2014-12-11|title=Research Note: An Introduction to the Economic Analysis of Open Data|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12626-014-0048-6|journal=The Review of Socionetwork Strategies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=119–128|doi=10.1007/s12626-014-0048-6|issn=1867-3236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Data vs. Paid Data ==
Open data has the capability to increase economic benefit through both individuals' and companies' use of the information. As of March 2016, it was estimated that open data was generating 0.5% more [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] compared to paid data.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theodi.org/research-economic-value-open-paid-data|title=Research: The economic value of open versus paid data|last=The Open Data Institute|first=|date=|website=theodi.org|publisher=|access-date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of open data relies on either funding from government to create and maintain the data or funding in the form of grants and volunteers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Data made open by governments largely relies on the publication of [[public service]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/Open-Data-for-Economic-Growth.pdf|title=OPEN DATA FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH|last=|first=|date=June 25, 2014|website=worldbank.org|publisher=Transport &amp; ICT Global Practice|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the data has already been created for a purpose, there is no creation cost for it to be made available to the public.

The opening of data requires current and advance technologies as well as the employment of users who are skilled enough to complete such work. When data is collected it cannot be presented to the public in its [[Raw data|raw]] form and may be inaccessible due to the program is uses or how the data is presented may be unusable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Time and funding is required to be reallocated by those who create the original dataset in order to make the data more accessible and usable for citizens to understand and engage with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When government is the main source of funding for the production of data it does not necessarily mean that they are the singular entity creating or managing the data. Governments sometimes contract out the creation or management of data to a third party. In some cases the third party may provide access to the data in exchange for a nominal fee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Citizen led initiatives face similar issues, such as the requirement of time and funding. For these types of initiatives it can be especially difficult because they do not have access to a guaranteed steady income such as taxpayer money; these organizations largely depend on donations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Paying for the use of public data would cover some of the costs associated with creating, maintaining and formatting data, although it would reduced the economic value of what once was opened by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/309810679/Permission-granted-The-economic-value-of-data-assets-under-alternative-policy-regimes|title=The economic value of data assets under alternative policy regime: A Lateral Economics report for the Open Data Institute.|last=Open Data Institute|first=|date=March 2016|website=scribd.com|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paying for the data that is now available for free would result in a lack of innovation, decreasing the GDP, as well as an increase in the cost of services created from use of purchased data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The opening of data reduces costs associated with licensing that is usually associated with paid data, as it costs more money to license a dataset than to have no license at all,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; though there are open datasets that use licensing as well. The opening of data itself does not simply create economic prosperity; systematic reforms would take place in order for open data innovations to find a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-3/generating-economic-value-through-open-data/|title=Generating Economic Value through Open Data|website=beyondtransparency.org|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Data and Economic Opportunity ==
Open data gains additional economic value when governments support open data initiatives, although increased uptake and citizen engagement is vital to the economic success of open data. Greater economic impact depends on revenue growth, [[cost reduction]], and job creation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capgemini-consulting.com/resource-file-access/resource/pdf/opendata_pov_6feb.pdf|title=The Open Data Economy Unlocking Economic Value by Opening Government and Public Data|last=Cappgiemini Consulting|first=|date=2013|website=capgemini-consulting.com/|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue can be increased through the use of open data with the creation of new businesses, new good or services, or improved goods and services. When businesses profit from the creation of goods or services that rely upon open data not only does their company reap the financial benefits but the government does as well, through the increase of tax revenue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cost reduction helps to increase revenue for private sector businesses but is also an asset to government. Cost reduction in government, whether through reduction of services required or labor requirements, reduces government spending in some areas allowing for investment in others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Open data can also increase economic benefit through the creation of jobs. Jobs can be created through innovative entrepreneurship or through the requirement of skilled labourers to use and understand data.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Examples of Open Data Financial Models ==
There are numerous ways in which businesses currently support the generation, creation and upkeep of their data. In most cases businesses, or [[Information broker|data brokers]], will sell this information to third parties for a profit. As charging a fee for data would defeat the purpose of open data, governments and businesses must rely on different financial models. Normally a government or business would finance a public sector body to generate the data and profit or cost recovery would be achieved through users paying a licensing fee back to the public sector body. In turn, the profit made by the users could then be taxed and return finances to the government.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donker|first=Frederika Welle|last2=Loenen|first2=Bastiaan van|date=2016-07-28|title=Sustainable Business Models for Public Sector Open Data Providers|url=http://www.jedem.org/index.php/jedem/article/view/390|journal=JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=28–61|issn=2075-9517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Budget Financing Model ===
Budget financing a specific amount of funds is allocated toward the open data project from general revenue.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this case the funding invested in to the project is only expected to cover the minimal costs. Businesses and Governments often expect to see a return from the opening up of data such as increased efficiency within their work environment or more positive citizen perceptions of the company or government.

=== Community Model ===
This model relies on individual citizens to invest their time and skills into generating and maintaining open data.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A very successful example of this would be [[OpenStreetMap]], which is continually updated and expanded by everyday users. The community model can also easily incorporate interactive benefits such as user feedback and the improvement of data quality. In this case there is a lot of room for innovation and conversation though the strong dependence on citizen engagement means individuals must actively be engaged with the data on a regular basis or risk the decrease in data quantity and quality.

=== Advertising Model ===
The advertising model is a popular method that can be seen across many online publications. In order to cover operating costs an open data publisher relies on revenue from advertisers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In these cases citizens are exposed to add banners and pop ups displayed on the same site as the data they are attempting to access. While this may prove sustainable for individual company websites some governments have policies against displaying advertisements on government webpages, which could prevent them from adapting such a model.

An '''ecosystem''' is a [[community (ecology)|community]] made up of living organisms and [[abiotic component|nonliving components]] such as air, water, and mineral soil.&lt;ref&gt;Tansley (1934); Molles (1999), p. 482; Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 380; Schulze ''et al''. (2005); p. 400; Gurevitch ''et al''. (2006), p. 522; Smith &amp; Smith 2012, p. G-5&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems can be studied in two different ways. They can be thought of as interdependent collections of plants and animals, or as structured systems and communities governed by general rules.&lt;ref name="Sagoff2003" /&gt; The living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[abiotic component|abiotic]]) components interact through [[nutrient cycles]] and energy flows.&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;{{cite book |last=Odum |first=Eugene P |date=1971 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |edition=third |publisher=Saunders |location=New York |isbn=0-53442-066-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems include interactions among organisms, and between organisms and their environment.&lt;ref name = Schulze400&gt;Schulze ''et al''. (2005), p.400&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems can be of any size but each ecosystem has a specific, limited space.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 380; Schulze ''et al''. (2005); p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scientists view the entire planet as one ecosystem.&lt;ref name = "planet"&gt;Willis (1997), p. 269; Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 5; Krebs (2009). p. 572&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy, water, [[nitrogen]] and soil minerals are essential abiotic components of an ecosystem. The energy used by ecosystems comes primarily from the [[sun]], via [[photosynthesis]]. Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun and also captures [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere. [[Animal]]s also play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through ecosystems. They influence the amount of plant and [[microbe|microbial]] [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] that lives in the system. As organic matter dies, carbon is released back into the atmosphere. This process also facilitates [[nutrient cycling]] by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be used again by plants and other microbes.&lt;ref name="Chapin10"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ecosystems are controlled by both external and internal factors. External factors such as [[climate]], the [[parent material]] that forms the soil, [[topography]] and time each affect ecosystems. However, these external factors are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Chapin11"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecosystems are dynamic: they are subject to periodic disturbances and are often in the process of recovering from past [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] and seeking balance.&lt;ref name="Chapin281" /&gt; Internal factors are different: They not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. Another way of saying this is that internal factors are subject to [[feedback|feedback loops]].&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

[[Human]]s operate within ecosystems and can influence both internal and external factors.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt; [[Global warming]] is an alleged example of a cumulative effect of human activities. Ecosystems provide benefits, called "[[ecosystem services]]", which people depend on for their [[livelihood]]. [[Ecosystem management]] is more efficient than trying to manage individual [[species]].{{TOC limit|3}}

== Definition ==
There is no single definition of what constitutes an ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Sagoff2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sagoff|first=Mark|year=2003|title=The plaza and the pendulum: Two concepts of ecological science|journal=Biology and Philosophy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=529–552|doi=10.1023/A:1025566804906}}&lt;/ref&gt; German ecologist Ernst-Detlef Schulze and coauthors defined an ecosystem as an area which is "uniform regarding the biological turnover, and contains all the fluxes above and below the ground area under consideration." They explicitly reject [[Gene Likens]]' use of entire [[Drainage basin|river catchments]] as "too wide a demarcation" to be a single ecosystem, given the level of heterogeneity within such an area.&lt;ref name="Schulze399"&gt;Schulze ''et al''. 300–402&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have suggested that an ecosystem can encompass a much larger area, even the whole planet.&lt;ref name="planet" /&gt; Schulze and coauthors also rejected the idea that a single rotting log could be studied as an ecosystem because the size of the flows between the log and its surroundings are too large, relative to the proportion cycles within the log.&lt;ref name="Schulze399" /&gt; Philosopher of science Mark Sagoff considers the failure to define "the kind of object it studies" to be an obstacle to the development of theory in [[ecosystem ecology]].&lt;ref name="Sagoff2003" /&gt;

Ecosystems can be studied in a variety of ways. Those include theoretical studies or more practical studies that monitor specific ecosystems over long periods of time or look at differences between ecosystems to better understand how they work. Some studies involve experimenting with direct manipulation of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Carpenter1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Stephen R.|author2=Jonathan J. Cole|author3=Timothy E.

Carpenter]] has argued that microcosm experiments can be "irrelevant and diversionary" if they are not carried out in conjunction with field studies done at the ecosystem scale.

===Related concepts===

T[[terrestrial ecosystem|errestrial ecosystem]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (found on land) and [[aquatic ecosystems]] (found in water) are concepts related to ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems are split into [[marine ecosystem]]s and [[freshwater ecosystem]]s.

=== External and internal factors ===
Ecosystems are controlled both by external and internal factors. External factors, also called state factors, control the overall structure of an ecosystem and the way things work within it, but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. The most important of these is [[climate]].&lt;ref name="Chapin11"/&gt; Climate determines the [[biome]] in which the ecosystem is embedded. Rainfall patterns and seasonal temperatures influence photosynthesis and thereby determine the amount of water and energy available to the ecosystem.&lt;ref name = "Chapin11"/&gt; 

[[Parent material]] determines the nature of the soil in an ecosystem, and influences the supply of mineral nutrients. [[Topography]] also controls ecosystem processes by affecting things like [[microclimate]], soil development and the movement of water through a system. For example, ecosystems can be quite different if situated in a small depression on the landscape, versus one present on an adjacent steep hillside.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

Other external factors that play an important role in ecosystem functioning include time and potential [[biota (ecology)|biota]]. Similarly, the set of organisms that can potentially be present in an area can also significantly affect ecosystems. Ecosystems in similar environments that are located in different parts of the world can end up doing things very differently simply because they have different pools of species present.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt; The [[introduced species|introduction of non-native species]] can cause substantial shifts in ecosystem function.

Unlike external factors, internal factors in ecosystems not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. Consequently, they are often subject to [[feedback|feedback loops]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin11"/&gt; While the [[Resource (biology)|resource]] inputs are generally controlled by external processes like climate and parent material, the availability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors like decomposition, root competition or shading.&lt;ref name = "Chapin11"/&gt; Other factors like disturbance, succession or the types of species present are also internal factors. 

===Primary production===
[[File:Seawifs global biosphere.jpg|upright=1.8|thumb|Global oceanic and terrestrial [[phototroph]] abundance, from September 1997 to August 2000. As an estimate of [[autotroph]] biomass, it is only a rough indicator of primary production potential and not an actual estimate of it.]]
{{main article|Primary production}}
Primary production is the production of [[organic matter]] from inorganic carbon sources. This mainly occurs through [[photosynthesis]]. The energy incorporated through this process supports life on earth, while the carbon makes up much of the organic matter in living and dead biomass, [[soil carbon]] and [[fossil fuel]]s. It also drives the [[carbon cycle]], which influences global [[climate]] via the [[greenhouse effect]].

Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine [[carbon dioxide]] and water to produce [[carbohydrate]]s and [[oxygen]]. The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP).&lt;ref name = "Chapin97"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 97–104&lt;/ref&gt; About 48–60% of the GPP is consumed in plant respiration. 

The remainder, that portion of GPP that is not used up by respiration, is known as the [[net primary production]] (NPP).&lt;ref name="Chapin123"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 123–150&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Energy flow===

{{main article|Energy flow (ecology)}}
{{See also|Food web|Trophic level}}
[[Energy]] and [[carbon]] enter ecosystems through [[photosynthesis]], are incorporated into living tissue, transferred to other organisms that feed on the living and dead plant matter, and eventually released through respiration.&lt;ref name="Chapin123" /&gt;

The carbon and energy incorporated into plant tissues (net primary production) is either consumed by animals while the plant is alive, or it remains uneaten when the plant tissue dies and becomes [[detritus]]. In [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, roughly 90% of the net primary production ends up being broken down by [[decomposition|decomposers]]. The remainder is either consumed by animals while still alive and enters the plant-based trophic system, or it is consumed after it has died, and enters the detritus-based trophic system. 

In [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic systems]], the proportion of plant biomass that gets consumed by [[herbivore]]s is much higher.&lt;ref name="Chapin244"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002) pp. 244–264&lt;/ref&gt;
In trophic systems photosynthetic organisms are the primary producers. The organisms that consume their tissues are called primary consumers or [[secondary production|secondary producers]]—[[herbivores]]. Organisms which feed on [[microbe]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]) are termed [[microbivore]]s. Animals that feed on primary consumers—[[carnivore]]s—are secondary consumers. Each of these constitutes a [[trophic level]].&lt;ref name="Chapin244" /&gt; 

The sequence of consumption—from plant to herbivore, to carnivore—forms a [[food chain]]. Real systems are much more complex than this—organisms will generally feed on more than one form of food, and may feed at more than one trophic level. Carnivores may capture some prey which are part of a plant-based trophic system and others that are part of a detritus-based trophic system (a bird that feeds both on herbivorous grasshoppers and earthworms, which consume detritus). Real systems, with all these complexities, form [[food web]]s rather than food chains.&lt;ref name="Chapin244" /&gt;

====Ecosystem ecology====
{{Main article|Ecosystem ecology}}
{{See also|Ecosystem model}}
[[File:East Scotia Ridge - Plos Biol 04.tif|thumb|right|A [[hydrothermal vent]] is an ecosystem on the ocean floor. (The scale bar is 1 m.)]]
Ecosystem ecology studies "the flow of energy and materials through organisms and the physical environment". It seeks to understand the processes which govern the stocks of material and energy in ecosystems, and the flow of matter and energy through them. The study of ecosystems can cover 10 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]], from the surface layers of rocks to the surface of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 3–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decomposition===
{{See also|Decomposition}}
The carbon and nutrients in [[soil organic matter|dead organic matter]] are broken down by a group of processes known as [[decomposition]]. This releases nutrients that can then be re-used for plant and microbial production and returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (or water) where it can be used for [[photosynthesis]]. In the absence of decomposition, the dead organic matter would accumulate in an ecosystem, and nutrients and atmospheric carbon dioxide would be depleted.&lt;ref name= Chapin151&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 151–157&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 90% of terrestrial net primary production goes directly from plant to decomposer.&lt;ref name = "Chapin244"/&gt;

Decomposition processes can be separated into three categories—[[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], fragmentation and chemical alteration of dead material. 

==== Leaching ====
As water moves through dead organic matter, it dissolves and carries with it the water-soluble components. These are then taken up by organisms in the soil, react with mineral soil, or are transported beyond the confines of the ecosystem (and are considered lost to it).&lt;ref name="Chapin151" /&gt; Newly shed leaves and newly dead animals have high concentrations of water-soluble components and include [[sugar]]s, [[amino acid]]s and mineral nutrients. Leaching is more important in wet environments and much less important in dry ones.&lt;ref name="Chapin151" /&gt;

==== Fragmentation ====
Fragmentation processes break organic material into smaller pieces, exposing new surfaces for colonization by microbes. Freshly shed [[leaf litter]] may be inaccessible due to an outer layer of [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] or [[Bark (botany)|bark]], and [[protoplasm|cell contents]] are protected by a [[cell wall]]. Newly dead animals may be covered by an [[exoskeleton]]. Fragmentation processes, which break through these protective layers, accelerate the rate of microbial decomposition.&lt;ref name= Chapin151/&gt; Animals fragment detritus as they hunt for food, as does passage through the gut. [[Freeze-thaw cycle]]s and cycles of wetting and drying also fragment dead material.&lt;ref name= Chapin151/&gt;

==== Chemical alteration ====
The chemical alteration of the dead organic matter is primarily achieved through bacterial and fungal action. Fungal [[hypha]]e produce enzymes which can break through the tough outer structures surrounding dead plant material. They also produce enzymes which break down [[lignin]], which allows them access to both cell contents and to the nitrogen in the lignin. Fungi can transfer carbon and nitrogen through their hyphal networks and thus, unlike bacteria, are not dependent solely on locally available resources.&lt;ref name = "Chapin151"/&gt;

==== Decomposition rates ====
{{Further|Decomposition#Rate of decomposition}}
Decomposition rates vary among ecosystems. The rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors—the physical environment (temperature, moisture, and soil properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers, and the nature of the microbial community itself.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 159–174&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature controls the rate of microbial respiration; the higher the temperature, the faster microbial decomposition occurs. It also affects soil moisture, which slows microbial growth and reduces leaching. Freeze-thaw cycles also affect decomposition—freezing temperatures kill soil microorganisms, which allows leaching to play a more important role in moving nutrients around. This can be especially important as the soil thaws in the spring, creating a pulse of nutrients which become available.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt;

Decomposition rates are low under very wet or very dry conditions. Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils tend to become deficient in oxygen (this is especially true in [[wetland]]s), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth.

===Nutrient cycling===
{{See also|Nutrient cycle|Biogeochemical cycle}}
[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Biological nitrogen cycling]]
Ecosystems continually exchange energy and carbon with the wider [[environment (systems)|environment]]. Mineral nutrients, on the other hand, are mostly cycled back and forth between plants, animals, microbes and the soil. Most nitrogen enters ecosystems through biological [[nitrogen fixation]], is deposited through precipitation, dust, gases or is applied as [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name="Chapin197"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 197–215&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Nitrogen cycle ====
{{Main|Nitrogen cycle}}

Since most [[terrestrial ecosystems]] are nitrogen-limited, [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen cycling]] is an important control on ecosystem production.&lt;ref name="Chapin197" /&gt;

Until modern times, nitrogen fixation was the major source of nitrogen for ecosystems. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria either live [[symbiosis|symbiotically]] with plants or live freely in the soil. The energetic cost is high for plants which support nitrogen-fixing symbionts—as much as 25% of gross primary production when measured in controlled conditions. Many members of the [[legume]] plant family support nitrogen-fixing symbionts. Some [[cyanobacteria]] are also capable of nitrogen fixation. These are [[phototroph]]s, which carry out photosynthesis. Like other nitrogen-fixing bacteria, they can either be free-living or have symbiotic relationships with plants.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt; Other sources of nitrogen include [[acid deposition]] produced through the combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, [[ammonia]] gas which evaporates from agricultural fields which have had fertilizers applied to them, and dust.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt; Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs account for about 80% of all nitrogen fluxes in ecosystems.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt;

When plant tissues are shed or are eaten, the nitrogen in those tissues becomes available to animals and microbes. Microbial decomposition releases nitrogen compounds from dead organic matter in the soil, where plants, fungi, and bacteria compete for it. Some soil bacteria use organic nitrogen-containing compounds as a source of carbon, and release [[ammonium]] ions into the soil. This process is known as [[ammonification|nitrogen mineralization]]. Others convert ammonium to [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] ions, a process known as [[nitrification]]. [[Nitric oxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are also produced during nitrification.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt; Under nitrogen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions, nitrates and nitrites are converted to [[nitrogen|nitrogen gas]], a process known as [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt;

==== Other nutrients ====
Other important nutrients include [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]] and [[manganese]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin215"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 215–222&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorus enters ecosystems through [[weathering]]. As ecosystems age this supply diminishes, making phosphorus-limitation more common in older landscapes (especially in the tropics).&lt;ref name = "Chapin215"/&gt; Calcium and sulfur are also produced by weathering, but acid deposition is an important source of sulfur in many ecosystems. Although magnesium and manganese are produced by weathering, exchanges between soil organic matter and living cells account for a significant portion of ecosystem fluxes. Potassium is primarily cycled between living cells and soil organic matter.&lt;ref name = "Chapin215"/&gt;

===Function and biodiversity===
{{Main|Biodiversity}}
[[File:View of loch lomond.JPG|thumb|[[Loch Lomond]] in [[Scotland]] forms a relatively isolated ecosystem. The fish community of this lake has remained stable over a long period until a number of [[introduced species|introductions]] in the 1970s restructured it's [[food web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Adams | first=C.E. | title=The fish community of Loch Lomond, Scotland: its history and rapidly changing status | journal=Hydrobiologia | year=1994 | volume=290 | issue=1–3 | pages=91–102 | doi=10.1007/BF00008956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Spiny Forest Ifaty Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Spiny forest at Ifaty, [[Madagascar]], featuring various ''[[Adansonia]]'' (baobab) species, ''[[Alluaudia procera]]'' (Madagascar ocotillo) and other vegetation.]]
[[Biodiversity]] plays an important role in ecosystem functioning.&lt;ref name="Schulze449"&gt;Schulze ''et al''. (2005), pp. 449–453&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that ecosystem processes are driven by the number of species in an ecosystem, the exact nature of each individual species, and the relative abundance organisms within these species.&lt;ref name="Chapin265"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 265–277&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem processes are broad generalizations that actually take place through the actions of individual organisms. The nature of the organisms—the species, [[functional group (ecology)|functional groups]] and trophic levels to which they belong—dictates the sorts of actions these individuals are capable of carrying out and the relative efficiency with which they do so. 

Ecological theory suggests that in order to coexist, species must have some level of [[limiting similarity]]—they must be different from one another in some fundamental way, otherwise one species would [[competitive exclusion|competitively exclude]] the other.&lt;ref name="niche"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoener|first=Thomas W.|title=The Princeton Guide to Ecology|editor=[[Simon A. Levin]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|year=2009|pages=2–13|chapter=Ecological Niche|isbn=978-0-691-12839-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the cumulative effect of additional species in an ecosystem is not linear—additional species may enhance nitrogen retention, for example, but beyond some level of species richness, additional species may have little additive effect.&lt;ref name = "Chapin265"/&gt; 

The addition (or loss) of species which are ecologically similar to those already present in an ecosystem tends to only have a small effect on ecosystem function. Ecologically distinct species, on the other hand, have a much larger effect. Similarly, dominant species have a large effect on ecosystem function, while rare species tend to have a small effect. [[Keystone species]] tend to have an effect on ecosystem function that is disproportionate to their abundance in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Chapin265" /&gt; Similarly, an [[ecosystem engineer]] is any [[organism]] that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]].

===Dynamics===

Ecosystems are dynamic entities. They are subject to periodic disturbances and are in the process of recovering from some past disturbance.&lt;ref name="Chapin281"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A. Matson|author3=Harold A. Mooney|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95443-0|location=New York|pages=281–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a [[perturbation (biology)|perturbation]] occurs, an ecoystem responds by moving away from its initial state. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its [[resistance (ecology)|resistance]]. On the other hand, the speed with which it returns to its initial state after disturbance is called its [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; Time plays a role in the development of soil from bare rock and the [[ecological succession|recovery of a community from disturbance]].&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

From one year to another, ecosystems experience variation in their biotic and abiotic environments. A drought, an especially cold winter and a pest outbreak all constitute short-term variability in environmental conditions. Animal populations vary from year to year, building up during resource-rich periods and crashing as they overshoot their food supply. These changes play out in changes in [[net primary production]] [[decomposition]] rates, and other ecosystem processes.&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; Longer-term changes also shape ecosystem processes—the forests of eastern North America still show legacies of cultivation which ceased 200 years ago, while [[methane]] production in eastern [[Siberia|Siberian]] lakes is controlled by organic matter which accumulated during the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt;

[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]] also plays an important role in ecological processes. [[F. Stuart Chapin III|F. Stuart Chapin]] and coauthors define disturbance as "a relatively discrete event in time and space that alters the structure of populations, communities, and ecosystems and causes changes in resources availability or the physical environment".&lt;ref name = "Chapin 285"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; This can range from tree falls and insect outbreaks to hurricanes and wildfires to volcanic eruptions. Such disturbances can cause large changes in plant, animal and microbe populations, as well soil organic matter content.&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; Disturbance is followed by [[ecological succession|succession]], a "directional change in ecosystem structure and functioning resulting from biotically driven changes in resources supply."&lt;ref name = "Chapin 285"/&gt;

The frequency and severity of disturbance determine the way it affects ecosystem function. A major disturbance like a volcanic eruption or [[Glacier|glacial]] advance and retreat leave behind soils that lack plants, animals or organic matter. Ecosystems that experience such disturbances undergo [[primary succession]]. A less severe disturbance like forest fires, hurricanes or cultivation result in [[secondary succession]] and a faster recovery.&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; More severe disturbance and more frequent disturbance result in longer recovery times.

==Classification methods==
{{See also|Ecosystem diversity|Ecoregion|Ecological land classification|Ecotope}}

Classifying ecosystems into ecologically homogeneous units is an important step towards effective ecosystem management.&lt;ref name="Lugo1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugo|first=A. E.|author2=S.L.

A variety of systems exist, based on vegetation cover, remote sensing, and [[Holdridge life zones|bioclimatic classification]] systems.&lt;ref name = "Lugo1999"/&gt; 

[[Ecological land classification]] is a cartographical delineation or [[regionalisation]] of distinct [[ecology|ecological]] areas, identified by their [[geology]], [[topography]], [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], [[climate]] conditions, living species, [[habitat]]s, water resources, and sometimes also [[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellogg|first=Charles|title=A Method for the Classification of Rural Lands for Assessment in Western North Dakota|journal=The Journal of Land &amp; Public Utility Economics|date=February 1933|volume=9|issue=1|page=12|jstor=3138756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human activities==
Human activities are important in almost all ecosystems. Although humans exist and operate within ecosystems, their cumulative effects are large enough to influence external factors like climate.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

===Ecosystem goods and services===
[[File:Avalanche Lake, looking south.jpg|thumb|The [[High Peaks Wilderness Area]] in the {{convert|6000000|acre|sing=on}} [[Adirondack Park]] is an example of a diverse ecosystem.]]
{{Main article|Ecosystem services|Ecological goods and services}}
{{See also|Ecosystem valuation|Ecological yield}}
Ecosystems provide a variety of goods and services upon which people depend.&lt;ref name="Christensen1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Christensen |first1=Norman L. |first2=Ann M. |last2=Bartuska |first3=James H. |last3=Brown |first4=Stephen |last4=Carpenter |first5=Carla |last5=D'Antonio |first6=Robert |last6=Francis |first7=Jerry F. |last7=Franklin |first8=James A. |last8=MacMahon |first9=Reed F. |last9=Noss |first10=David J. |last10=Parsons |first11=Charles H. |last11=Peterson |first12=Monica G. |last12=Turner |first13=Robert G. |last13=Woodmansee |year=1996|title=The Report of the Ecological Society of America Committee on the Scientific Basis for Ecosystem Management|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=3|pages=665–691|doi=10.2307/2269460|citeseerx=10.1.1.404.4909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem goods include the "tangible, material products" of ecosystem processes such as food, construction material, medicinal plants.&lt;ref name="Brown2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Thomas C.|author2=John C. Bergstrom|author3=John B. Loomis|year=2007|title=Defining, valuing and providing ecosystem goods and services|url=http://lawlibrary.unm.edu/nrj/47/2/04_brown_goods.pdf|deadurl=yes|journal=Natural Resources Journal|volume=47|issue=2|pages=329–376|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525213257/http://lawlibrary.unm.edu/nrj/47/2/04_brown_goods.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also include less tangible items like [[tourism]] and recreation, and genes from wild plants and animals that can be used to improve domestic species.&lt;ref name="Christensen1998"/&gt; 

[[Ecosystem services]], on the other hand, are generally "improvements in the condition or location of things of value".&lt;ref name="Brown2007" /&gt; These include things like the maintenance of hydrological cycles, cleaning air and water, the maintenance of oxygen in the atmosphere, crop [[pollination]] and even things like beauty, inspiration and opportunities for research.&lt;ref name="Christensen1998" /&gt; While ecosystem goods have traditionally been recognized as being the basis for things of economic value, ecosystem services tend to be taken for granted.&lt;ref name="Brown2007" /&gt;

===Ecosystem management===
{{Main article|Ecosystem management}}
{{See also|Ecological economics|Sustainability|Sustainable development}}
When [[natural resource management]] is applied to whole ecosystems, rather than single species, it is termed [[ecosystem management]].&lt;ref name="Grumbine1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grumbine |first=R. Edward |year=1994 |title=What is ecosystem management? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=27–38 |url=http://www.pelagicos.net/MARS6920_spring2010/readings/Grumbine_1994.pdf |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1994.08010027.x |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051519/http://www.pelagicos.net/MARS6920_spring2010/readings/Grumbine_1994.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although definitions of ecosystem management abound, there is a common set of principles which underlie these definitions.&lt;ref name="Chapin362"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A. Matson|author3=Harold A. Mooney|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95443-0|location=New York|pages=362–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental principle is the long-term [[sustainability]] of the production of goods and services by the ecosystem;&lt;ref name = "Chapin362"/&gt; "intergenerational sustainability [is] a precondition for management, not an afterthought".&lt;ref name="Christensen1998"/&gt; 

While ecosystem management can be used as part of a plan for [[wilderness]] conservation, it can also be used in intensively managed ecosystems&lt;ref name="Christensen1998"/&gt; (see, for example, [[agroecosystem]] and [[close to nature forestry]]).

===Threats caused by humans===
{{see also|Planetary boundaries}}
As human population and per capita consumption grow, so do the resource demands imposed on ecosystems and the effects of the human [[ecological footprint]]. Natural resources are vulnerable and limited. The environmental impacts of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] actions are becoming more apparent. Problems for all ecosystems include: [[Pollution|environmental pollution]], [[climate change]] and [[biodiversity loss]]. For [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial ecosystems]] further threats include [[air pollution]], [[Soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]],  and [[deforestation]]. For [[aquatic ecosystems]] threats include also unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example [[overfishing]] of certain species), [[marine pollution]], [[microplastics]] pollution, [[water pollution]], and building on coastal areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Society is increasingly becoming aware that [[ecosystem services]] are not only limited but also that they are threatened by human activities. The need to better consider long-term [[ecosystem health]] and its role in enabling human habitation and economic activity is urgent. To help inform decision-makers, many ecosystem services are being assigned economic values, often based on the cost of replacement with anthropogenic alternatives. The ongoing challenge of prescribing economic value to nature, for example through [[biodiversity banking]], is prompting transdisciplinary shifts in how we recognize and manage the environment, [[social responsibility]], business opportunities, and our future as a species.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== History ==
The term "ecosystem" was first used in 1935 in a publication by British ecologist [[Arthur Tansley]].&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;The term ecosystem was actually coined by [[Arthur Roy Clapham]], who came up with the word at Tansley's request (Willis 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Willis1997"&gt;Willis (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Tansley devised the concept to draw attention to the importance of transfers of materials between organisms and their environment.&lt;ref name = "Chapin7"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 7–11)&lt;/ref&gt; He later refined the term, describing it as "The whole system, ... including not only the organism-complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the environment".&lt;ref name="Tansley1935"&gt;Tansley (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; Tansley regarded ecosystems not simply as natural units, but as "mental isolates".&lt;ref name="Tansley1935" /&gt; Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term [[ecotope]].&lt;ref name="Tansley1939"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1io8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|title=The British Islands and Their Vegetation|last=Tansley|first=A.G.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1939|authorlink=Arthur Tansley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]], a [[limnologist]] who was a contemporary of Tansley's, combined [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]'s ideas about [[Trophic level|trophic]] ecology with those of Russian geochemist [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. As a result, he suggested that mineral nutrient availability in a lake limited [[Algal bloom|algal production]]. This would, in turn, limit the abundance of animals that feed on algae. [[Raymond Lindeman]] took these ideas further to suggest that the flow of energy through a lake was the primary driver of the ecosystem. Hutchinson's students, brothers [[Howard T. Odum]] and [[Eugene P. Odum]], further developed a "systems approach" to the study of ecosystems. This allowed them to study the flow of energy and material through ecological systems.&lt;ref name = "Chapin7"/&gt;

[[File:Discharge pipe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wastewater]] discharge]]
'''Effluent''' is an outflowing of water or gas to a natural body of water, from a structure such as a [[wastewater treatment plant]], [[Sewerage|sewer pipe]], or industrial outfall. Effluent, in engineering, is the stream exiting a [[chemical reactor]].&lt;ref&gt; Scott Fogler, ''Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering'', page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Effluent is defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] as "''wastewater - treated or untreated - that flows out of a treatment plant, sewer, or industrial outfall. Generally refers to wastes discharged into surface waters''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/OCEPAterms/eterms.html |title=Terms of Environment Beginning With "E"    |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2010-06-09 |date=2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Compact Oxford English Dictionary defines effluent as "''liquid waste or sewage discharged into a river or the sea''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/effluent?view=uk |title=AskOxford: effluent |work=Ask Oxford.com |publisher=Oxford University Press, |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effluent in the artificial sense is in general considered to be [[water pollution]], such as the outflow from a [[sewage treatment]] facility or the [[wastewater]] discharge from industrial facilities. An effluent [[sump pump]], for instance, pumps waste from toilets installed below a main sewage line. Similar to wastewater produced in different establishments, industries, and facilities. These wastewater released can also accumulate and pollute the nearby communities and bodies of water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canencia|first=Oliva P|last2=Dalugdug|first2=Marlou D|last3=Emano|first3=Athena Marie|last4=Mendoza|first4=Richard|last5=Walag|first5=Angelo Mark P.|date=2016-08-31|title=Slaughter waste effluents and river catchment watershed contamination in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307931158_Slaughter_waste_effluents_and_river_catchment_watershed_contamination_in_Cagayan_de_Oro_City_Philippines | journal=ResearchGate | volume=9 | issue=2 | issn=2220-6663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[waste water treatment plants]], effluent that has been treated is sometimes called ''secondary effluent'', or ''treated effluent''.  This cleaner effluent is then used to feed the [[bacteria]] in [[biofilters]].

In the context of a [[thermal power station]], the output of the cooling system may be referred to as the effluent cooling water, which is noticeably warmer than the environment.  Effluent only refers to liquid discharge.  

In [[sugar beet]] processing, effluent is often settled in water tanks that allow the mud-contaminated water to settle. The mud sinks to the bottom, leaving the top section of water clear, free to be pumped back into the river or be reused in the process again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27829">{{short description|The hypothesis that, in the course of evolution, some entirely new properties, such as mind and consciousness, appear at certain critical points}}
'''Emergent evolution''' was the [[hypothesis]] that, in the course of [[evolution]], some entirely new properties, such as mind and [[consciousness]], appear at certain critical points, usually because of an unpredictable rearrangement of the already existing entities. The term was originated by the psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2001"&gt;Bowler, Peter J. (2001). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 140-142, pp. 376-384. {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis was widely criticized for providing no mechanism to how entirely new properties emerge, and for its historical roots in [[teleology]].&lt;ref name="Bowler 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, Brian P. (1992). ''The Rise and Fall of British Emergentism''. In A. Beckerman, H. Flohr, and J. Kim, eds., ''Emergence or Reduction? Essays on the Prospects of Nonreductive Physicalism''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. pp. 49–93. {{ISBN|3-11-012880-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, Charles A. (1929). ''The Philosophic Functions of Emergence''. ''[[The Philosophical Review]]''. Vol. 38, No. 4. pp. 372-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
The term ''[[emergence|emergent]]'' was first used to describe the concept by [[George Lewes]] in volume two of his 1875 book ''Problems of Life and Mind'' (p.&amp;nbsp;412).  [[Henri Bergson]] covered similar themes in his popular 1907 book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' on the [[Élan vital]].  Emergence was further developed by [[Samuel Alexander]] in his [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] during 1916–18 and published as ''Space, Time, and Deity'' (1920).  The related term ''emergent evolution'' was coined by [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] in his own Gifford lectures of 1921–22 at [[University of St. Andrews|St. Andrews]] and published as ''Emergent Evolution'' (1923). In an appendix to a lecture in his book, Morgan acknowledged the contributions of [[Roy Wood Sellars]]'s ''Evolutionary Naturalism'' (1922).

== Origins ==

=== Response to Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' ===

[[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s presentation of [[natural selection]], coupled to the idea of evolution in Western thought, had gained acceptance due to the wealth of observational data provided and the seeming replacement of divine law with natural law in the affairs of men.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robert G.B.|title=Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262182572|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mechanism of [[natural selection]] described at the time only explained how organisms adapted to variation. The cause of genetic variation was unknown at the time.

{{quote|Darwin knew that nature had to produce variations before natural selection could act …The problem had been caught by other evolutionists almost as soon as ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was first published. [[Sir Charles Lyell]] saw it clearly in 1860 before he even became an evolutionist…(Reid, p.3)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

[[St. George Jackson Mivart|St. George Jackson Mivart's]] ''On the Genesis of Species'' (1872) and [[Edward Drinker Cope|Edward Cope]]'s ''Origin of the Fittest'' (1887) raised the need to address the origin of variation between members of a species. [[William Bateson]] in 1884 distinguished between the origin of novel variations and the action of natural selection (''Materials for the Study of Variation Treated with Especial Regard to Discontinuity in the Origin of Species'').&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

=== Wallace's further thoughts ===

Wallace throughout his life continued to support and extend the scope of Darwin's theory of evolution via the mechanism of natural selection. One of his works, ''Darwinism'', was often cited in support of Darwin's theory. He also worked to elaborate and extend Darwin and his ideas on natural selection. However, Wallace also realized that the scope and claim of the theory was limited. Darwin himself had limited it.

{{quote|the most prominent feature is that I enter into popular yet critical examination of those underlying fundamental problems which Darwin purposely excluded from his works as being beyond the scope of his enquiry. Such are the nature and cause of Life itself, and more especially of its most fundamental and mysterious powers - growth and reproduction ...

Darwin always ... adduced the "laws of Growth with Reproduction," and of "Inheritance with Variability," as being fundamental facts of nature, without which Natural Selection would be powerless or even non-existent ...

... even if it were proved to be an exact representation of the facts, it would not be an explanation... because it would not account for the forces, the directive agency, and the organising power which are essential features of growth …&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=Theory of Life|year=1911|publisher=Moffat, Yard and Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_world_of_life.html?id=M6UUAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In examining this aspect, excluded ''ab initio'' by Darwin, Wallace came to the conclusion that ''Life'' itself cannot be understood except by means of a theory that includes "an organising and directive Life-Principle." These necessarily involve a "Creative Power", a "directive Mind" and finally "an ultimate Purpose" (the development of Man). It supports the view of [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] that "life is the cause, not the consequence" of the organisation of matter. Thus, life precedes matter and when it infuses matter, forms living matter (protoplasm).

{{quote|a very well-founded doctrine, and one which was often advocated by John Hunter, that life is the cause and not the consequence of organisation ... if so, life must be antecedent to organisation, and can only be conceived as indissolubly connected with spirit and with thought, and with the cause of the directive energy everywhere manifested in the growth of living things ... endowed with the mysterious organising power we term life ...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}
Wallace then refers to the operation of another power called "mind" that utilizes the power of life and is connected with a higher realm than life or matter:

{{quote|evidence of a foreseeing mind which...so directed and organised that life, in all its myriad forms, as, in the far-off future, to provide all that was most essential for the growth and development of man's spiritual nature ...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}

Proceeding from Hunter's view that Life is the directive power above and behind living matter, Wallace argues that logically, Mind is the cause of [[consciousness]], which exists in different degrees and kinds in living matter.

{{quote|If, as John Hunter, T.H. Huxley, and other eminent thinkers have declared, "life is the cause, not the consequence, of organisation," so we may believe that mind is the cause, not the consequence, of brain development.

... So there are undoubtedly different degrees and probably also different kinds of mind in various grades of animal life&amp;nbsp;... And&amp;nbsp;... so the mind-giver&amp;nbsp;... enables each class or order of animals to obtain the amount of mind requisite for its place in nature&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}

== Emergent evolution ==

=== Early roots ===
The issue of how change in nature 'emerged' can be found in classical Greek thought -  order coming out of chaos and whether by chance or necessity. [[Aristotle]] spoke of wholes that were greater than the sum of their parts because of emergent properties. The second-century anatomist and physiologist [[Galen]] also distinguished between the resultant and emergent qualities of wholes. (Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;72)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

[[Hegel]] spoke of the revolutionary progression of life from non-living to conscious and then to the spiritual and Kant perceived that simple parts of an organism interact to produce a progressively complex series of emergences of functional forms, a distinction that carried over to [[John Stuart Mill]] (1843), who stated that even chemical compounds have novel features that cannot be predicted from their elements. [Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;72]&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

The idea of an emergent quality that was something new in nature was further taken up by [[George Henry Lewes]] (1874–1875), who again noted, as with Galen earlier, that these evolutionary "emergent" qualities are distinguishable from adaptive, additive "resultants." [[Henry Drummond (evangelist)|Henry Drummond]] in ''The Descent of Man'' (1894) stated that emergence can be seen in the fact that the laws of nature are different for the organic or vital compared to the inertial inorganic realm.

{{quote|When we pass from the inorganic to the organic we come upon a new set of laws - but the reason why the lower set do not seem to operate in the higher sphere is not that they are annhilated, but that they are overruled. (Drummond 1883, p. 405, quoted in Reid)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

As Reid points out, Drummond also realized that greater complexity brought greater adaptability. (Reid. p.&amp;nbsp;73)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

[[Samuel Alexander]] took up the idea that emergences had properties that overruled the demands of the lower levels of organization. And more recently, this theme is taken up by John Holland (1998):

{{quote|If we turn reductionism on its head we add levels. More carefully, we add new laws that satisfy the constraints imposed by laws already in place. Moreover these new laws apply to complex phenomena that are consequences of the original laws; they are at a new level.&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=John|title=Emergence. From Chaos to Order|year=1998|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== C. Lloyd Morgan and emergent evolution ===
Another major scientist to question natural selection as the motive force of evolution was [[C. Lloyd Morgan]], a zoologist and student of [[T.H. Huxley]], who had a strong influence on Samuel Alexander. His ''Emergent Evolution'' (1923) established the central idea that an emergence might have the appearance of [[Saltation (biology)|saltation]] but was best regarded as "a qualitative change of direction or critical turning point."(quoted in Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;73-74)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  Morgan, due to his work in animal psychology, had earlier (1894) questioned the  continuity view of mental evolution, and held that there were various discontinuities in cross-species mental abilities. To offset any attempt to read [[anthropomorphism]] into his view, he created the famous, but often misunderstood methodological canon:
 
{{quote|In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale.|Morgan, 1894, p. 53}}
However, Morgan realizing that this was being misused to advocate reductionism (rather than as a general methodological caution), introduced a qualification into the second edition of his ''An Introduction to Comparative Psychology'' (1903):

{{quote|To this, however, it should be added, lest the range of the principle be misunderstood, that the canon by no means excludes the interpretation of a particular activity in terms of the higher processes, if we already have independent evidence of the occurrence of these higher processes in the animal under observation.|Morgan, 1903, p. 59}}

As Reid observes,

{{quote|While the so-called historiographical "rehabilitation of the canon" has been underway for some time now, Morgan's emergent evolutionist position (which was the highest expression of his attempt to place the study of mind back into such a "wider" natural history) is seldom mentioned in more than passing terms even within contemporary history of psychology textbooks.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

Morgan also fought against the [[Behaviorism|behaviorist school]] and clarified even more his emergent views on evolution:

{{quote|An influential school of 'behaviorists' roundly deny that mental relations, if such there be, are in any sense or in any manner effective... My message is that one may speak of mental relations as effective no less 'scientifically' than... physical relations...|Morgan, 1930, p. 72}}

His ''Animal Conduct'' (1930) explicitly distinguishes between three "grades" or "levels of mentality" which he labeled: 'percipient, perceptive, and reflective.' (p.&amp;nbsp;42)

=== Alexander and the emergence of mind ===

Morgan's idea of a polaric relationship between lower and higher, was taken up by Samuel Alexander, who argued that the mental process is not reducible to the neural processes on which it depends at the physical-material level. Instead, they are two poles of a unity of function. Further, the neural process that expressed mental process itself possesses a quality (mind) that the other neural processes don’t. At the same time, the mental process, because it is functionally identical to this particular neural process, is also a vital one.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Samuel|title=Space, Time and Deity|year=1916–18|publisher=Gifford Lectures|location=Glasgow|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Deity.html?id=v70tAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And mental process is also "something new, "a fresh creation", which precludes a psycho-physiological parallelism. Reductionism is also contrary to empirical fact.

{{quote|All the available evidence of fact leads to the conclusion that the mental element is essential to the neural process which it is said to accompany...and is not accidental to it, nor is it in turn indifferent to the mental feature. Epiphenomenalism is a mere fallacy of observation.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

At the same time Alexander stated that his view was not one of animism or vitalism, where the mind is an independent entity action on the brain, or conversely, acted upon by the brain. Mental activity is an emergent, a new "thing" not reducible to its initial neural parts.

{{quote|All the available evidence of fact leads to the conclusion that the mental element is essential to the neural process which it is said to accompany...and is not accidental to it, nor is it in turn indifferent to the mental feature. Epiphenomenalism is a mere fallacy of observation.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

For Alexander, the world unfolds in space-time, which has the inherent quality of motion. This motion through space-time results in new “complexities of motion” in the form of a new quality or emergent. The emergent retains the qualities of the prior “complexities of motion” but also has something new that was not there before. This something new comes with its own laws of behavior. Time is the quality that creates motion through Space, and matter is simply motion expressed in forms in Space, or as Alexander says a little later, “complexes of motion.” Matter arises out of the basic ground of Space-Time continuity and has an element of “body” (lower order) and an element of “mind” (higher order), or “the conception that a secondary quality is the mind of its primary substrate.”

Mind is an emergent from life and life itself is an emergent from matter. Each level contains and is interconnected with the level and qualities below it, and to the extent that it contains lower levels, these aspects are subject to the laws of that level. All mental functions are living, but not all living functions are mental; all living functions are physico-chemical, but not all physico-chemical processes are living - just as we could say that all people living in Ohio are Americans, but not all Americans live in Ohio. Thus, there are levels of existence, or natural jurisdictions, within a given higher level such that the higher level contains elements of each of the previous levels of existence. The physical level contains the pure dimensionality of Space-Time in addition to the emergent of physico-chemical processes; the next emergent level, life, also contains Space-Time as well as the physico-chemical in addition to the quality of life; the level of mind contains all of the previous three levels, plus consciousness. As a result of this nesting and inter-action of emergents, like fluid Russian dolls, higher emergents cannot be reduced to lower ones, and different laws and methods of inquiry are required for each level.

{{quote|Life is not an epiphenomenon of matter but an emergent from it&amp;nbsp;... The new character or quality which the vital physico-chemical complex possesses stands to it as soul or mind to the neural basis.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

For Alexander, the "directing agency" or entelechy is found "in the principle or plan".

{{quote|a given stage of material complexity is characterised by such and such special features…By accepting this we at any rate confine ourselves to noting the facts…and do not invent entities for which there seems to be no other justification than that something is done in life which is not done in matter.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

While an emergent is a higher complexity, it also results in a new simplicity as it brings a higher order into what was previously less ordered (a new simplex out of a complex). This new simplicity does not carry any of the qualities or aspects of that emergent level prior to it, but as noted, does still carry within it such lower levels so can be understood to that extent through the science of such levels, yet not itself be understood except by a science that is able to reveal the new laws and principles applicable to it.
 
{{quote|Ascent takes place, it would seem, through complexity.[increasing order] But at each change of quality the complexity as it were gathers itself together and is expressed in a new simplicity.
Within a given level of emergence, there are degrees of development.
 
... There are on one level degrees of perfection or development; and at the same time there is affinity by descent between the existents belonging to the level. This difference of perfection is not the same thing as difference of order or rank such as subsists between matter and life or life and mind ...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

The concept or idea of mind, the highest emergent known to us, being at our level, extends all the way down to pure dimensionality or Space-Time. In other words, time is the “mind” of motion, materialising is the “mind” of matter, living the “mind” of life. Motion through pure time (or life astronomical, mind ideational) emerges as matter “materialising” (geological time, life geological, mind existential), and this emerges as life “living” (biological time, life biological, mind experiential), which in turn give us mind “minding” (historical time, life historical, mind cognitional). But there is also an extension possible upwards of mind to what we call Deity.

{{quote|let us describe the empirical quality of any kind of finite which performs to it the office of consciousness or mind as its 'mind.' Yet at the same time let us remember that the 'mind' of a living thing is not conscious mind but is life, and has not the empirical character of consciousness at all, and that life is not merely a lower degree of mind or consciousness, but something different. We are using 'mind' metaphorically by transference from real minds and applying it to the finites on each level in virtue of their distinctive quality; down to Space-Time itself whose existent complexes of bare space-time have for their mind bare time in its empirical variations.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

Alexander goes back to the Greek idea of knowledge being “out there” in the object being contemplated. In that sense, there is not mental object (concept) “distinct” (that is, different in state of being) from the physical object, but only an apparent split between the two, which can then be brought together by proper compresence or participation of the consciousness in the object itself.

{{quote|There is no consciousness lodged, as I have supposed, in the organism as a quality of the neural response; consciousness belongs to the totality of objects, of what are commonly called the objects of consciousness or the field of consciousness&amp;nbsp;... Consciousness is therefore "out there" where the objects are, by a new version of Berkleyanism&amp;nbsp;... Obviously for this doctrine as for mine there is no mental object as distinct from a physical object: the image of a tree is a tree in an appropriate form...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

Because of the interconnectedness of the universe by virtue of Space-Time, and because the mind apprehends space, time and motion through a unity of sense and mind experience, there is a form of knowing that is intuitive (participative) - sense and reason are outgrowths from it.
 
{{quote|In being conscious of its own space and time, the mind is conscious of the space and time of external things and vice versa. This is a direct consequence of the continuity of Space-Time in virtue of which any point-instant is connected sooner or later, directly or indirectly, with every other...

The mind therefore does not apprehend the space of its objects, that is their shape, size and locality, by sensation, for it depends for its character on mere spatio-temporal conditions, though it is not to be had as consciousness in the absence of sensation (or else of course ideation). It is clear without repeating these considerations that the same proposition is true of Time; and of motion&amp;nbsp;... I shall call this mode of apprehension in its distinction from sensation, intuition.&amp;nbsp;... Intuition is different from reason, but reason and sense alike are outgrowths from it, empirical determinations of it...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

In a sense, the universe is a participative one and open to participation by mind as well so that mind can intuitively know an object, contrary to what Kant asserted. Participation (togetherness) is something that is “enjoyed” (experienced) not contemplated, though in the higher level of consciousness, it would be contemplated.

{{quote|The universe for Alexander is essentially in process, with Time as its ongoing aspect, and the ongoing process consists in the formation of changing complexes of motions. These complexes become ordered in repeatable ways displaying what he calls "qualities." There is a hierarchy of kinds of organized patterns of motions, in which each level depends on the subvening level, but also displays qualities not shown at the subvening level nor predictable from it… On this there sometimes supervenes a further level with the quality called "life"; and certain subtle syntheses which carry life are the foundation for a further level with a new quality. "mind." This is the highest level known to us, but not necessarily the highest possible level. The universe has a forward thrust, called its "nisus" (broadly to be identified with the Time aspect) in virtue of which further levels are to be expected...&lt;ref name=Emmet&gt;{{cite web|last=Emmet |first=Dorothy |title=Whitehead and Alexander |url=http://www.religion-online/showarticle.asp?title=2834 |accessdate=23 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Robert G. B. Reid===

Emergent evolution was revived by Robert G. B. Reid, a biology professor at the [[University of Victoria]]. In his book ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis'' (1985), he stated that the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] with its emphasis on [[natural selection]] is an incomplete picture of evolution, and emergent evolution can explain the origin of genetic variation.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Mary B. (1986). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''. Vol. 61, No. 2, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, John F. (1987). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]''. Vol. 20, No. 3. pp. 424-425.&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] heavily criticized the book claiming it was a misinformed attack on natural selection. Mayr commented that Reid was working from an "obsolete conceptual framework", provided no solid evidence and that he was arguing for a [[Orthogenesis|teleological process of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. (1986). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. [[Isis (journal)|Isis]]. Vol. 77, No. 2, pp. 358-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid later published the book ''Biological Emergences'' (2007) with a theory on how emergent novelties are generated in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Christopher S. (2008). ''Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[Integrative and Comparative Biology]]''. Vol. 48, No. 6. pp. 871-873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biological-emergences "Biological Emergences"]. [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Massimo Pigliucci]] "Biological Emergences by Robert Reid is an interesting contribution to the ongoing debate on the status of evolutionary theory, but it is hard to separate the good stuff from the more dubious claims." Pigliucci noted a dubious claim in the book is that natural selection has no role in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Pigliucci, Massimo. (2009). [http://philpapers.org/archive/MASDWN/ "Down with Natural Selection?"] ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]''. 52: 134-140.&lt;/ref&gt; It was positively reviewed by biologist Alexander Badyaev who commented that "the book succeeds in drawing attention to an under appreciated aspect of the evolutionary process".&lt;ref&gt;Badyaev, Alexander V. (2008). ''Evolution Despite Natural Selection? Emergence Theory and the Ever Elusive Link Between Adaptation and Adaptability''. ''[[Acta Biotheoretica]]'' 56: 249-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have criticized Reid's unorthodox views on emergence and evolution. Biologist Samuel Scheiner stated that Reid's "presentation is both a caricature of evolutionary theory and severely out of date."&lt;ref&gt;Scheiner, Samuel M. (2004). ''The Metamorphosis of Evo-Devo''. ''[[BioScience]]''. Vol. 54, No. 12.  pp. 1150-1151.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''film''', also called a '''movie''', '''motion picture''', '''moving picture''', '''theatrical film''', or '''photoplay''', is a series of still images that, when shown on a [[Projection screen|screen]], create the illusion of moving images. (See the [[glossary of motion picture terms]].)

This [[optical illusion]] causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed in rapid succession. The process of [[filmmaking]] is both an [[art film|art]] and an [[film industry|industry]]. A film is created by [[photography|photographing]] actual scenes with a [[movie camera|motion-picture camera]], by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional [[animation]] techniques, by means of [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and [[computer animation]], or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other [[visual effects]].

The word "'''cinema'''", short for [[cinematography]], is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art of filmmaking itself. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences to communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribecafilm.com/future-of-film/future-of-the-movie-theater-is-in-your-mind|title=The Movie Theater of the Future Will Be In Your Mind|last=Severny|first=Andrei|date=2013-09-05|work=[[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907214603/http://tribecafilm.com/future-of-film/future-of-the-movie-theater-is-in-your-mind|archivedate=September 7, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=September 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films were originally recorded onto plastic film through a [[Photographic film|photochemical]] process and then shown through a [[movie projector]] onto a large screen. Contemporary films are now often [[Digital recording|fully digital]] through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous [[sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]] (a graphic [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] of the spoken words, music and other [[sound]]s that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).

Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for [[documentary film|educating]]—or [[propaganda film|indoctrinating]]—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] to [[translation|translate]] the dialog into other languages.

The individual images that make up a film are called [[Film frame|frames]]. In the projection of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as [[persistence of vision]], whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called the [[phi phenomenon]].

The name "film" originates from the fact that [[photographic film]] (also called [[film stock]]) has historically been the [[Recording medium|medium]] for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including ''picture'', ''picture show'', ''moving picture'', ''photoplay'', and ''flick''. The most common term in the [[United States]] is ''movie'', while in [[Europe]] ''film'' is preferred. Common terms for the field in general include ''the big screen'', ''the silver screen'', ''the movies'', and ''cinema''; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early years, the word ''sheet'' was sometimes used instead of ''screen''.

== History ==
{{Main|History of film}}
[[File:LouisLePrinceFirstFilmEver RoundhayGardenScene.png|thumb|left|alt=A screenshot of Roundhay Garden Scene by the French Louis Le Prince, the world's first film|A frame from ''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'', the world's earliest surviving film produced using a motion picture camera, by [[Louis Le Prince]], 1888.]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1988-035-15, Berlin, Wintergarten.jpg|thumb|alt=Berlin Wintergarten theatre, vaudeville stage at the Berlin Conservatory from the 1940s|The [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre]] was the site of the first [[Movie theater|cinema]] ever, with a [[short film]] presented by the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] on 1 November 1895. (Pictured here is a [[variety show]] at the theater in July 1940.)]]

===Preceding technologies===
Preceding film in origin by thousands of years, early [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[dances]] had elements common to film: [[Script (performing arts)|scripts]], [[Set construction|sets]], [[costumes]], [[Filmmaking#Production|production]], [[Film director|direction]], [[actors]], [[audiences]], [[storyboards]] and [[Film score|scores]]. Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism apply, such as [[mise en scène]] (roughly, the entire visual picture at any one time). Owing to the lack of any technology for doing so, the moving images and sounds could not be recorded for replaying as with film.

The [[magic lantern]], probably created by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the 1650s, could be used to project [[animation]], which was achieved by various types of mechanical slides. Typically, two glass slides, one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that was to move, would be placed one on top of the other and projected together, then the moving slide would be hand-operated, either directly or by means of a lever or other mechanism. Chromotrope slides, which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns and colors, were operated by means of a small crank and pulley wheel that rotated a glass disc.&lt;ref name="Barber, Theodore X. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barber | first1 = Theodore X | year = 1989 | title = Phantasmagorical Wonders: The Magic Lantern Ghost Show in Nineteenth-Century America | url = | journal = Film History | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 73–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, inventions such as [[Joseph Plateau]]'s [[phenakistoscope]] and the later [[zoetrope]] demonstrated that a carefully designed sequence of drawings, showing phases of the changing appearance of objects in motion, would appear to show the objects actually moving if they were displayed one after the other at a sufficiently rapid rate. These devices relied on the phenomenon of [[persistence of vision]] to make the display appear continuous even though the observer's view was actually blocked as each drawing rotated into the location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed. Each sequence was limited to a small number of drawings, usually twelve, so it could only show endlessly repeating cyclical motions. By the late 1880s, the last major device of this type, the [[praxinoscope]], had been elaborated into a form that employed a long coiled band containing hundreds of images painted on glass and used the elements of a [[magic lantern]] to project them onto a screen.

The use of sequences of [[photography|photographs]] in such devices was initially limited to a few experiments with subjects photographed in a series of poses because the available [[photographic emulsion|emulsions]] were not sensitive enough to allow the short [[exposure (photography)|exposures]] needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving. The sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s, [[Eadweard Muybridge]] created the first animated image sequences photographed in real-time. A row of cameras was used, each, in turn, capturing one image on a [[photographic plate|photographic glass plate]], so the total number of images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras, about two dozen at most. Muybridge used his system to analyze the movements of a wide variety of animal and human subjects. Hand-painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his [[zoopraxiscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Alan Larson (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ESVZOghoi6kC&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=Eadweard%20Muybridge%20horse%20-%20english%20photographer Republic of images: a history of French filmmaking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428103430/https://books.google.com/books?id=ESVZOghoi6kC&amp;pg=PA17 |date=2016-04-28 }} Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===First motion pictures===
By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of [[celluloid]] [[photographic film]] and the invention of [[Movie camera|motion picture cameras]], which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact [[reel]] of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a "peep show" device such as the [[Kinetoscope]] and the [[mutoscope]]. Others were intended for a [[movie projector|projector]], mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these "moving pictures" could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was [[Blacksmith Scene]], produced by [[Edison Manufacturing Company]] in 1893. The following year the company would begin [[Edison Studios]], which became an early leader in the film industry with notable early shorts including [[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]], and would go on to produce close to 1,200 films.

The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American [[Woodville Latham]] and his sons, using films produced by their company, and by the – arguably better known – French brothers [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] with ten of their own productions.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham's slightly predating the Lumière brothers'.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Another opinion is that the first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in America was at [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University|Brooklyn Institute]] in [[New York City]] 9 May 1893.

===Early evolution===
The earliest films were simply one static [[Shot (filming)|shot]] that showed an event or action with no [[Film editing|editing]] or other [[cinematic technique]]s. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several [[Scene (filming)|scenes]] together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until [[sound film]] became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely [[visual arts|visual art]], but these innovative [[silent film]]s had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a [[piano|pianist]] or [[organ (music)|organist]] or, in large urban theaters, a full [[orchestra]] to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete [[film score]]s were composed for major productions.

[[File:Charlie Chaplin, the Marriage Bond.ogg|thumb|alt=A clip from the Charlie Chaplin silent film, The Bond from 1918 Motion Picture Division of the U.S. National Archives|A clip from the [[Charlie Chaplin]] silent film ''[[The Bond]]'' (1918)]]

The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]], while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], typified most prominently by the innovative work of [[D. W. Griffith]] in [[The Birth of a Nation]] (1915) and [[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]] (1916). However, in the 1920s, European filmmakers such as [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|F. W. Murnau]] and [[Fritz Lang]], in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through Griffith, along with the contributions of [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and others, quickly caught up with American film-making and continued to further advance the medium.

===Sound===
In the 1920s, the development of electronic [[sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] technologies made it practical to incorporate a [[soundtrack]] of speech, music and [[sound effects]] synchronized with the action on the screen.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The resulting [[sound film]]s were initially distinguished from the usual silent "moving pictures" or "movies" by calling them "talking pictures" or "talkies."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The revolution they wrought was swift. By 1930, silent film was practically extinct in the US and already being referred to as "the old medium."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Colour===
Another major technological development was the introduction of "[[color motion picture film|natural color]]," which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring, stencil-coloring or other arbitrary procedures, although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from "natural" in appearance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While the advent of sound films quickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete, color replaced black-and-white much more gradually.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the [[Technicolor]] process, first used for animated cartoons in 1932, then also for live-action [[short film]]s and isolated sequences in a few [[feature film]]s, then for an entire feature film, ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'', in 1935. The expense of the process was daunting, but favorable public response in the form of increased [[box office]] receipts usually justified the added cost. The number of films made in color slowly increased year after year.

===1950s developments===
In the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, [[widescreen]] processes, [[polarized 3D system|polarized 3D projection]], and [[stereophonic sound]] were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first, they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with rare exceptions reluctantly made only at the insistence of "star" directors such as [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and [[Martin Scorsese]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===1960s and later===
The decades following the decline of the [[studio system]] in the 1960s saw changes in the production and style of film. Various New Wave movements (including the [[French New Wave]], [[Parallel Cinema|Indian New Wave]], [[Japanese New Wave]], and [[New Hollywood]]) and the rise of film-school-educated independent filmmakers contributed to the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Digital technology has been the driving force for change throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. Digital 3D projection largely replaced earlier problem-prone 3D film systems and has become popular in the early 2010s.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Film theory==
[[File:BolexH16.jpg|right|thumb|alt=16 mm spring-wound Bolex H16 Reflex camera|This [[16 mm film|16 mm]] spring-wound [[Bolex]] "H16" Reflex camera is a popular entry level camera used in [[film school]]s.]]
"Film theory" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as [[art]]. The concept of film as an art-form began with [[Ricciotto Canudo]]'s ''The Birth of the Sixth Art''. [[Formalist film theory]], led by [[Rudolf Arnheim]], [[Béla Balázs]], and [[Siegfried Kracauer]], emphasized how film differed from reality and thus could be considered a valid [[fine art]]. [[André Bazin]] reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its differences from reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis spurred by [[Jacques Lacan]]'s psychoanalysis and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s [[semiotics]] among other things has given rise to [[psychoanalytic film theory]], [[structuralist film theory]], [[feminist film theory]], and others. On the other hand, critics from the [[analytical philosophy]] tradition, influenced by [[Wittgenstein]], try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a [[Form of life (philosophy)|form of life]].

===Language===
Film is considered to have its own [[language]]. [[James Monaco]] wrote a classic text on film theory, titled "How to ''Read'' a Film," that addresses this. Director [[Ingmar Bergman]] famously said, "[[Andrei Tarkovsky]] for me is the greatest [[Film director|director]], the one who invented a ''new language'', true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream." An example of the language is a sequence of back and forth images of one speaking actor's left profile, followed by another speaking actor's right profile, then a repetition of this, which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation. This describes another theory of film, the [[180-degree rule]], as a visual story-telling device with an ability to place a viewer in a context of being psychologically present through the use of visual composition and editing. The "[[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood style]]" includes this narrative theory, due to the overwhelming practice of the rule by movie studios based in Hollywood, California, during film's classical era. Another example of cinematic language is having a shot that zooms in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent reflection that cuts to a shot of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the first actor, indicating that the first person is remembering a past self, an edit of compositions that causes a time transition.

===Montage===
{{Main|Montage (filmmaking)|l1=Montage}}
Montage is the technique by which separate pieces of film are selected, edited, and then pieced together to make a new section of film. A scene could show a man going into battle, with flashbacks to his youth and to his home-life and with added special effects, placed into the film after filming is complete. As these were all filmed separately, and perhaps with different actors, the final version is called a montage. Directors developed a theory of montage, beginning with [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] and the complex juxtaposition of images in his film ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]''.&lt;ref name=JNFilmtheory&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelmes|first=Jill|title=An introduction to film studies|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-26269-9|page=394|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jcCADouuE_UC&amp;pg=PA394&amp;q=montage|edition=3rd ed., Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporation of musical and visual [[counterpoint]], and scene development through [[mise en scene]], [[editing]], and effects has led to more complex techniques comparable to those used in [[opera]] and [[ballet]].

===Film criticism===
{{Main|Film criticism}}

Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. In general, these works can be divided into two categories: academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in [[newspaper]]s and other media. Film critics working for newspapers, [[magazine]]s, and [[broadcast media]] mainly review new releases. Normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate their opinions. Despite this, critics have an important impact on the audience response and attendance at films, especially those of certain [[film genre|genres]]. Mass marketed [[action film|action]], [[horror film|horror]], and [[comedy film]]s tend not to be greatly affected by a critic's overall judgment of a film. The plot summary and description of a film and the assessment of the director's and screenwriters' work that makes up the majority of most film reviews can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film. For prestige films such as most [[drama film|dramas]] and [[art film]]s, the influence of reviews is important. Poor reviews from leading critics at major papers and magazines will often reduce audience interest and attendance.

The impact of a reviewer on a given film's [[box office]] performance is a matter of debate. Some observers claim that [[movie marketing]] in the 2000s is so intense, well-coordinated and well financed that reviewers cannot prevent a poorly written or filmed [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] from attaining market success. However, the cataclysmic failure of some heavily promoted films which were harshly reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent films indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence. Other observers note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little-known films. Conversely, there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film. However, this usually backfires, as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result. Journalist film critics are sometimes called film reviewers. Critics who take a more academic approach to films, through publishing in film journals and writing books about films using [[film theory]] or [[film studies]] approaches, study how film and filming techniques work, and what effect they have on people. Rather than having their reviews published in newspapers or appearing on television, their articles are published in scholarly journals or up-market magazines. They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities as professors or instructors.

==Industry==

{{Main|Film industry}}
[[File:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|alt=Babelsberg Studio near Berlin gate with pedestrian island|Founded in 1912, the [[Babelsberg Studio]] near [[Berlin]] was the first large-scale film studio in the world, and the forerunner to [[Hollywood]]. It still produces global blockbusters every year.]]
The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumières]] quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import, and screen additional product commercially. The [[Oberammergau Passion Play]] of 1898{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} was the first commercial motion picture ever produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated [[movie theater|theaters]] and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors became major [[celebrity|celebrities]] and commanded huge fees for their performances. By 1917 [[Charlie Chaplin]] had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars. From 1931 to 1956, film was also the only image storage and playback system for [[television programming]] until the introduction of [[videotape recorder]]s.

In the United States, much of the film industry is centered around [[Hollywood, California]]. Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world, such as [[Mumbai]]-centered [[Bollywood]], the [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry's]] [[Hindi]] cinema which produces the largest number of films in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/04/07/india.sexywood/index.html Bollywood Hots Up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307024113/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/04/07/india.sexywood/index.html |date=2008-03-07 }} cnn.com. Retrieved June 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the expense involved in making films has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of [[movie studio]]s, recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish.

Profit is a key force in the industry, due to the costly and risky nature of filmmaking; many films have large [[cost overruns]], an example being [[Kevin Costner]]'s ''[[Waterworld]]''. Yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance. The [[Academy Awards]] (also known as "the Oscars") are the most prominent film awards in the [[United States]], providing recognition each year to films, based on their artistic merits. There is also a large industry for educational and instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts. Revenue in the industry is sometimes volatile due to the reliance on [[blockbuster film]]s released in [[movie theater]]s. The rise of alternative home entertainment has raised questions about the future of the cinema industry, and Hollywood employment has become less reliable, particularly for medium and low-budget films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christopherson|first=Susan|date=2013-03-01|title=Hollywood in decline?

==Associated fields==
{{Further|Film theory|Product placement|Propaganda}}
Derivative academic fields of study may both interact with and develop independently of filmmaking, as in [[film theory]] and analysis. Fields of academic study have been created that are derivative or dependent on the existence of film, such as [[film criticism]], [[film history]], divisions of [[film propaganda]] in authoritarian governments, or psychological on subliminal effects (e.g., of a flashing soda can during a screening). These fields may further create derivative fields, such as a [[movie review]] section in a newspaper or a television guide. Sub-industries can spin off from film, such as popcorn makers, and film-related toys (e.g., [[Star Wars action figures|''Star Wars'' figures]]). Sub-industries of pre-existing industries may deal specifically with film, such as [[product placement]] and other [[advertising]] within films.

==Terminology==
The terminology used for describing motion pictures varies considerably between [[British and American English]]. In British usage, the name of the medium is "film". The word "movie" is understood but seldom used.&lt;ref name="britam"&gt;{{cite web|title=British English/American English Vocabulary|url=https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/british-american.htm|accessdate=26 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621191145/http://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/british-american.htm|archivedate=21 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sdope"&gt;{{cite web|title=British English vs. U.S. English – film vs. movie|url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=363802|work=Straight Dope Message Board|accessdate=26 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110091840/http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=363802|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "the pictures" (plural) is used semi-frequently to refer to the place where movies are exhibited, while in American English this may be called "the movies", but it is becoming outdated. In other countries, the place where movies are exhibited may be called a cinema or [[movie theatre]]. By contrast, in the United States, "movie" is the predominant form. Although the words "film" and "movie" are sometimes used interchangeably, "film" is more often used when considering [[artistic]], [[theoretical]], or [[technology|technical]] aspects. The term "movies" more often refers to [[entertainment]] or [[Commerce|commercial]] aspects, as where to go for fun evening on a date. For example, a book titled "How to Understand a Film" would probably be about the aesthetics or theory of film, while a book entitled "Let's Go to the Movies" would probably be about the history of entertaining movies and [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]].

Further terminology is used to distinguish various forms and media used in the film industry. "Motion pictures" and "moving pictures" are frequently used terms for film and movie productions specifically intended for theatrical exhibition, such as, for instance, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. "[[DVD]]" and "[[videotape]]" are video formats that can reproduce a photochemical film. A reproduction based on such is called a "transfer." After the advent of theatrical film as an industry, the television industry began using videotape as a recording medium. For many decades, tape was solely an analog medium onto which moving images could be either recorded or transferred. "Film" and "filming" refer to the photochemical medium that chemically records a visual image and the act of recording respectively. However, the act of shooting images with other visual media, such as with a digital camera, is still called "filming" and the resulting works often called "films" as interchangeable to "movies," despite not being shot on film. "[[Silent films]]" need not be utterly silent, but are films and movies without an audible dialogue, including those that have a musical accompaniment. The word, "[[Talkies]]," refers to the earliest sound films created to have [[Hearing (sense)|audible]] [[dialogue]] recorded for playback along with the film, regardless of a musical accompaniment. "Cinema" either broadly encompasses both films and movies, or it is roughly synonymous with film and theatrical exhibition, and both are capitalized when referring to a category of art. The "[[silver screen]]" refers to the projection screen used to exhibit films and, by extension, is also used as a [[metonym]] for the entire film industry.

"[[Widescreen]]" refers to a larger width to height in the [[film frame|frame]], compared to earlier historic [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s.&lt;ref name="imdbmovietermsw"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/W |title=Movie Terminology Glossary: W |work= |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722052010/http://www.imdb.com/glossary/W |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "feature-length film", or "[[feature film]]", is of a conventional full length, usually 60 minutes or more, and can commercially stand by itself without other films in a ticketed screening.&lt;ref name="imdbmovietermsf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/F |title=Movie Terminology Glossary: F |work= |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722051945/http://www.imdb.com/glossary/F |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[short subject|short]]" is a film that is not as long as a feature-length film, often screened with other shorts, or preceding a feature-length film. An "[[Independent film|independent]]" is a film made outside the conventional film industry.

In US usage, one talks of a "[[Film screening|screening]]" or "[[Movie projector|projection]]" of a movie or video on a [[Projection screen|screen]] at a public or private "theater." In British English, a "film showing" happens at a [[movie theatre|cinema]] (never a "[[theatre]]", which is a different medium and place altogether).&lt;ref name="sdope" /&gt; A cinema usually refers to an arena designed specifically to exhibit films, where the screen is affixed to a wall, while a theater usually refers to a place where live, non-recorded action or combination thereof occurs from a podium or other type of stage, including the amphitheater. Theaters can still screen movies in them, though the theater would be retrofitted to do so. One might propose "going to the cinema" when referring to the activity, or sometimes "to the pictures" in British English, whereas the US expression is usually "going to the movies." A cinema usually shows a mass-marketed movie using a front-projection screen process with either a film projector or, more recently, with a digital projector. But, cinemas may also show theatrical movies from their home video transfers that include Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and videocassette when they possess sufficient projection quality or based upon need, such as movies that exist only in their transferred state, which may be due to the loss or deterioration of the film master and prints from which the movie originally existed. Due to the advent of [[digital cinema|digital film production and distribution]], physical film might be absent entirely. A "[[double feature]]" is a screening of two independently marketed, stand-alone feature films. A "viewing" is a watching of a film. "[[Sales]]" and "at the box office" refer to tickets sold at a theater, or more currently, rights sold for individual showings. A "[[Film release|release]]" is the distribution and often simultaneous screening of a film. A "[[preview (theatre)|preview]]" is a screening in advance of the main release.

Any film may also have a "[[sequel]]", which portrays events following those in the film. ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' is an early example. When there are more films than one with the same characters, story arcs, or subject themes, these movies become a "series," such as the [[James Bond]] series. And, existing outside a specific story timeline usually, does not exclude a film from being part of a series. A film that portrays events occurring earlier in a timeline with those in another film, but is released after that film, is sometimes called a "[[prequel]]," an example being ''[[Butch and Sundance: The Early Days]]''.

The "credits," or "end credits," is a list that gives credit to the people involved in the production of a film. Films from before the 1970s usually start a film with credits, often ending with only a title card, saying "The End" or some equivalent, often an equivalent that depends on the language of the production{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. From then onward, a film's credits usually appear at the end of most films. However, films with credits that end a film often repeat some credits at or near the start of a film and therefore appear twice, such as that film's acting leads, while less frequently some appearing near or at the beginning only appear there, not at the end, which often happens to the director's credit. The credits appearing at or near the beginning of a film are usually called "titles" or "beginning titles." A [[post-credits scene]] is a scene shown after the end of the credits. ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' has a post-credit scene in which Ferris tells the audience that the film is over and they should go home.

A film's "cast" refers to a collection of the actors and actresses who appear, or "star," in a film. A star is an actor or actress, often a popular one, and in many cases, a [[celebrity]] who plays a central character in a film. Occasionally the word can also be used to refer to the fame of other members of the crew, such as a director or other personality, such as [[Martin Scorsese]]. A "crew" is usually interpreted as the people involved in a film's physical construction outside cast participation, and it could include directors, film editors, photographers, grips, gaffers, set decorators, prop masters, and costume designers. A person can both be part of a film's cast and crew, such as [[Woody Allen]], who directed and starred in ''[[Take the Money and Run]]''.

A "film goer," "movie goer," or "film buff" is a person who likes or often attends films and movies, and any of these, though more often the latter, could also see oneself as a student to films and movies or the filmic process. Intense interest in films, film theory, and film criticism, is known as [[cinephilia]]. A film enthusiast is known as a cinephile or cineaste.

===Preview===
{{main|Test screening}}
A preview performance refers to a showing of a film to a select audience, usually for the purposes of corporate promotions, before the public film premiere itself. Previews are sometimes used to judge audience reaction, which if unexpectedly negative, may result in recutting or even refilming certain sections based on the [[audience response]]. One example of a film that was changed after a negative response from the test screening is 1982's ''[[First Blood]]''. After the test audience responded very negatively to the death of protagonist [[John Rambo]], a [[Vietnam veteran]], at the end of the film, the company wrote and re-shot a new ending in which the character survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bp/first-blood-turns-30-rambo-original-dark-end-174610790.html|title='First Blood' Turns 30: Rambo's original dark end|location=[[Yahoo!

===Trailer and teaser===
{{main|Film trailer}}

Trailers or previews are advertisements for films that will be shown in 1 to 3 months at a cinema. Back in the early days of cinema, with theaters that had only one or two screens, only certain trailers were shown for the films that were going to be shown there. Later, when theaters added more screens or new theaters were built with a lot of screens, all different trailers were shown even if they weren't going to play that film in that theater. Film studios realized that the more trailers that were shown (even if it wasn't going to be shown in that particular theater) the more patrons would go to a different theater to see the film when it came out. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film program. That practice did not last long because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film (or the "A film" in a [[double feature]] program) begins. Film trailers are also common on [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Trailers are created to be engaging and interesting for viewers. As a result, in the Internet era, viewers often seek out trailers to watch them. Of the ten billion videos watched online annually in 2008, film trailers ranked third, after news and user-created videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | title = AWFJ Opinion Poll: All About Movie Trailers | publisher = AWFJ | date = 2008-05-09 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011641/http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | archivedate = 2013-12-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teasers are a much shorter preview or advertisement that lasts only 10 to 30 seconds. Teasers are used to get patrons excited about a film coming out in the next six to twelve months. Teasers may be produced even before the film production is completed.

==Education and propaganda==
{{Main|Educational film|Propaganda film}}

Film is used for a range of goals, including education and propaganda. When the purpose is primarily educational, a film is called an "[[educational film]]". Examples are recordings of academic lectures and experiments, or a film based on a classic novel. Film may be [[propaganda film|propaganda]], in whole or in part, such as the films made by [[Leni Riefenstahl]] in Nazi Germany, US war film trailers during World War II, or artistic films made under Stalin by [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]. They may also be works of political protest, as in the films of [[Andrzej Wajda]], or more subtly, the films of [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]. The same film may be considered educational by some, and propaganda by others as the categorization of a film can be subjective.

== Production ==
{{Main|Filmmaking}}

At its core, the means to produce a film depend on the content the filmmaker wishes to show, and the apparatus for displaying it: the [[zoetrope]] merely requires a series of images on a strip of paper. Film production can, therefore, take as little as one person with a camera (or even without a camera, as in [[Stan Brakhage]]'s 1963 film ''[[Mothlight]]''), or thousands of actors, extras, and crew members for a live-action, feature-length epic.

The necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down to conception, planning, execution, revision, and distribution. The more involved the production, the more significant each of the steps becomes. In a typical [[production cycle]] of a Hollywood-style film, these main stages are defined as [[Script development|development]], [[pre-production]], [[Film production|production]], [[post-production]] and [[Film distributor|distribution]].

This production cycle usually takes three years. The first year is taken up with ''development''. The second year comprises ''preproduction'' and ''production''. The third year, ''post-production'' and ''distribution''. The bigger the production, the more resources it takes, and the more important [[Film budgeting|financing]] becomes; most [[feature film]]s are artistic works from the creators' perspective (e.g., [[film director]], [[cinematographer]], [[screenwriter]]) and for-profit business entities for the production companies.

===Crew===
{{Main|Film crew}}

A film crew is a group of people hired by a film company, employed during the "production" or "photography" phase, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. ''Crew'' is distinguished from ''cast'', who are the [[actor]]s who appear in front of the [[camera]] or provide voices for characters in the film. The ''crew'' interacts with but is also distinct from the ''production staff'', consisting of producers, managers, company representatives, their assistants, and those whose primary responsibility falls in pre-production or post-production phases, such as [[screenwriter]]s and [[film editor]]s. Communication between ''production'' and ''crew'' generally passes through the director and his/her staff of assistants. Medium-to-large crews are generally divided into departments with well-defined hierarchies and standards for interaction and cooperation between the departments. Other than acting, the crew handles everything in the photography phase: props and costumes, shooting, sound, electrics (i.e., lights), sets, and production special effects. [[Caterer]]s (known in the film industry as "craft services") are usually not considered part of the crew.

===Technology===
{{see also|Cinematic techniques}}
[[Film stock]] consists of transparent [[celluloid]], [[acetate]], or [[polyester]] [[film base|base]] coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. Stock widths and the [[film format]] for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] prints.
Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked [[movie camera|cameras]] and [[movie projector|projectors]]; though 1000 frames per minute (16{{sfrac|2|3}} frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18 frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_car_1.htm |title=Silent Film Speed |publisher=Cinemaweb.com |date=1911-12-02 |accessdate=2010-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407224839/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_car_1.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sound film]] was introduced in the late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second were chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} Improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras&amp;nbsp;– allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design&amp;nbsp;– allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large "blimps" to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated [[film stock|filmstocks]] and [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], allowing [[Film director|directors]] to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures, many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.

As a medium, film is not limited to motion pictures, since the technology developed as the basis for [[photography]]. It can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow. Film has also been incorporated into [[multimedia]] presentations and often has importance as primary historical documentation. However, historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage, and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives. Most films on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films. Some studios save color films through the use of [[separation masters]]: three B&amp;W negatives each exposed through red, green, or blue filters (essentially a reverse of the [[Technicolor]] process). Digital methods have also been used to restore films, although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation. [[Film preservation]] of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase revenue). Preservation is generally a higher concern for nitrate and single-strip color films, due to their high decay rates; black-and-white films on safety bases and color films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better, assuming proper handling and storage.

Some films in recent decades have been recorded using [[analog (signal)|analog]] [[video]] technology similar to that used in [[television production]]. Modern [[Digital video|digital video cameras]] and [[digital projector]]s are gaining ground as well. These approaches are preferred by some film-makers, especially because footage shot with [[digital cinema]] can be evaluated and edited with [[non-linear editing system]]s (NLE) without waiting for the film stock to be processed. The migration was gradual, and as of 2005, most major motion pictures were still shot on film.{{update after|2015|6|3}}

===Independent===
{{Main|Independent film}}
[[File:Fratelli Lumiere.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Auguste and Louis Lumière brothers seated looking left|[[Auguste and Louis Lumière|The Lumière Brothers]], who were among the first filmmakers]]
Independent filmmaking often takes place outside Hollywood, or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major film studio]]. Creative, business and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century. On the business side, the costs of big-budget studio films also lead to conservative choices in cast and crew. There is a trend in Hollywood towards co-financing (over two-thirds of the films put out by [[Warner Bros.]] in 2000 were joint ventures, up from 10% in 1987).&lt;ref name="VARIETY_2003"&gt;{{cite web|first=Meredith|last=Amdur|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117895718&amp;categoryid=10|title=Sharing Pix is Risky Business|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2003-11-16|accessdate=June 23, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915040337/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117895718&amp;categoryid=10|archivedate=September 15, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hopeful director is almost never given the opportunity to get a job on a big-budget studio film unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television. Also, the studios rarely produce films with unknown actors, particularly in lead roles.

Before the advent of [[digital cinematography|digital]] alternatives, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce, direct, or star in a traditional studio film. But the advent of consumer [[camcorder]]s in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of high-resolution [[digital video]] in the early 1990s, have lowered the technology barrier to film production significantly. Both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered; in the 2000s, the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a commodity-based [[personal computer]]. Technologies such as [[DVD]]s, [[FireWire]] connections and a wide variety of professional and consumer-grade [[video editing software]] make film-making relatively affordable.

Since the introduction of digital video [[DV]] technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot a film with a digital video camera and edit the film, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a high-end home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on [[film festival]]s to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. The arrival of internet-based video websites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Veoh]] has further changed the filmmaking landscape, enabling indie filmmakers to make their films available to the public.

===Open content film===
{{Main|Open content film}}

An open content film is much like an independent film, but it is produced through open collaborations; its source material is available under a [[license]] which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create [[fan fiction]] or derivative works, than a traditional copyright. Like independent filmmaking, open source filmmaking takes place outside Hollywood, or other major [[studio system]]s.

===Fan film===
{{Main|Fan film}}

A fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, [[television program]], [[comic book]] or a similar source, created by [[fan (aficionado)|fans]] rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been [[amateur]]s, but some of the most notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to rarer full-length motion pictures.

==Distribution==
{{Main|Film distribution|Film release}}

Film distribution is the process through which a film is made available for viewing by an [[audience]]. This is normally the task of a professional [[film distributor]], who would determine the marketing strategy of the film, the media by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing, and may set the [[film release|release date]] and other matters. The film may be exhibited directly to the public either through a [[movie theater]] (historically the main way films were distributed) or [[television]] for [[home video|personal home viewing]] (including on [[DVD-Video]] or [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]], online [[download]]ing, [[television program]]s through [[broadcast syndication]] etc.). Other ways of distributing a film include rental or personal purchase of the film in a variety of media and formats, such as [[VHS]] tape or [[DVD]], or [[Internet]] [[download]]ing of [[streaming media|streaming]] using a computer.

==Animation==
{{Main|Animation}}
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|An animated image of a horse, made using eight pictures.]]
Animation is a technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually, whether generated as a computer graphic, or by photographing a drawn image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see [[claymation]] and [[stop motion]]), and then photographing the result with a special [[animation camera]]. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second, there is an illusion of continuous movement (due to the [[phi phenomenon]]). Generating such a film is very labor-intensive and tedious, though the development of [[computer animation]] has greatly sped up the process. Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for [[Television|TV]] and films comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of [[independent animation]] has existed at least since the 1950s, with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.

[[Limited animation]] is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using "short cuts" in the animation process. This method was pioneered by [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and popularized by [[Hanna-Barbera]] in the [[United States]], and by [[Osamu Tezuka]] in [[Japan]], and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from [[movie theater]]s to [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm|title= Hanna Barbera's golden age of animation|accessdate= 2007-01-25|last= Savage|first= Mark|date= 2006-12-19|work= |publisher= BBC News|pages= |language= |deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061219211006/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm|archivedate= 2006-12-19|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most animation studios are now using digital technologies in their productions, there is a specific style of animation that depends on film. Camera-less animation, made famous by film-makers like [[Norman McLaren]], [[Len Lye]], and [[Stan Brakhage]], is painted and drawn directly onto pieces of film, and then run through a projector.

Fine bubble diffusers produce a plethora of very small air bubbles which rise slowly from the floor of a wastewater treatment plant or sewage treatment plant aeration tank and provide substantial and efficient mass transfer of oxygen to the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr. B.C. Punmia|author2=Ashok Kr. Jain|author3=Arun Kr. Jain|title=Waste Water Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmsvcHoq2cgC|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Firewall Media|isbn=978-81-7008-091-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen, combined with the food source, [[sewage]], allows the bacteria to produce enzymes which help break down the waste so that it can settle in the secondary clarifiers or be filtered by membranes. A fine bubble diffuser is commonly manufactured in various forms: tube, disc, plate, and dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Fine Bubble Aeration |series=Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/fine.pdf |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 832-F-99-065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bubble size==
The subject of bubble size is important because the aeration system in a wastewater or sewage treatment plant consumes an average of 50 to 70 percent of the energy of the entire plant.&lt;ref name="Spellman2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank R. Spellman|title=Water &amp; Wastewater Infrastructure: Energy Efficiency and Sustainability|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bgg-8vIdpIC&amp;pg=PA300|date=2013-03-12|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-1785-1|pages=300–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the oxygen transfer efficiency decreases the power the plant requires to provide the same quality of [[effluent]] water.  Furthermore, fine bubble diffusers evenly spread out (often referred to as a 'grid arrangement') on the floor of a tank, provide the operator of the plant a great deal of operational flexibility.  This can be used to create zones with high oxygen concentrations (oxic or [[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]]), zones with minimal oxygen concentration ([[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]]) and zones with no oxygen (anaerobic). This allows for more precise targeting and removal of specific contaminants.

The importance of achieving ever smaller bubble sizes has been a hotly debated subject in the industry as ultra fine bubbles (micrometre size) are generally perceived to rise too slowly and provide too little "pumpage" to provide adequate mixing of sewage in an aeration tank. On the other hand, the industry standard "fine bubble" with a typical discharge diameter of 2&amp;nbsp;mm is probably larger than it needs to be for many plants.  Average bubble diameters of 0.9&amp;nbsp;mm are possible nowadays, using special polyurethane (PUR) or special recently developed EPDM membranes.&lt;ref name="Spellman2013"/&gt;

Fine bubble diffusers have largely replaced [[coarse bubble diffusers]] and mechanical aerators in most of the developed world and in much of the developing world. The exception would be in secondary treatment phases, such as activated sludge processing tanks, where 85 to 90 percent of any remaining solid materials (floating on the surface) are removed through settling or biological processes. The biological process uses air to encourage bacterial growth that would consume many of these waste materials, such as phosphorus and nitrogen that are dissolved in the wastewater. The larger air release openings of a coarse bubble diffuser helps to facilitate a higher oxygen transfer rate and bacterial growth. One disadvantage of using fine bubble diffusers in activated sludge tanks is the tendency of floc (particle) clogging the small air release holes.&lt;ref name="woodard2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Woodard|title=Industrial Waste Treatment Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G4tT0ESKVpUC&amp;pg=PA286|date=2001-09-11|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-08-049539-2|pages=286–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flora''' is the [[plant]] life occurring in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring or [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]]—[[native plant]] life. The corresponding term for [[animal]] life is [[fauna]]. ''Flora'', ''fauna'' and other forms of [[Kingdom (biology)|life]] such as [[fungus|fungi]] are collectively referred to as [[Biota (taxonomy)|biota]]. Sometimes [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are also referred to as flora, as in the terms [[gut flora]] or [[skin flora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora|title=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/bitn/97-007/pdf/bitn97-007.pdf|author1=Clifford E. Starliper |author2=Rita Villella |author3=Patricia Morrison |author4=Jay Mathais |title=Sampling the bacterial flora of freshwater mussels}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John, D.M. |author2=Whitton, B.A. |author3=Brook, A.J. |year=2002|title=The Freshwater Algal Flora of the British Isles: An Identification Guid to Freshwater and Terrestrial Algae|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521770514|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sc4897dfM_MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "flora" comes from the [[Latin]] name of [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], the [[goddess]] of [[plant]]s, [[flower]]s, and fertility in [[Roman mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rengel|first1=Kathleen N. Daly ; revised by Marian|last2=Daly|first2=Kathleen|title=Greek and Roman mythology, A to Z|date=2009|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|location=New York|isbn=1604134127|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=may be the other way round, i.e. the goddess was named using a pre-existing word for flowers|date=December 2015}}

The distinction between [[vegetation]] (the general appearance of a community) and flora (the taxonomic composition of a community) was first made by [[Jules Thurmann]] (1849). Prior to this, the two terms were used indiscriminately.&lt;ref&gt;Thurmann, J. (1849). ''Essai de Phytostatique appliqué à la chaîne du Jura et aux contrées voisines.'' Berne: Jent et Gassmann, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/51540#/summary].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;Martins, F. R. &amp; Batalha, M. A. (2011). Formas de vida, espectro biológico de Raunkiaer e fisionomia da vegetação. In: Felfili, J. M., Eisenlohr, P. V.; Fiuza de Melo, M. M. R.; Andrade, L. A.; Meira Neto, J. A. A. (Org.). ''Fitossociologia no Brasil: métodos e estudos de caso.'' Vol. 1. Viçosa: Editora UFV. p. 44-85. [http://files.hisaias.webnode.com/200000112-37f2239e9a/Cap%202.pdf]. Earlier version, 2003, [http://www2.ib.unicamp.br/profs/fsantos/bt682/2003/Apostila-FormasVida-2003.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora classifications==

Plants are grouped into floras based on region ([[Phytochorion|floristic regions]]), period, special environment, or climate. Regions can be  distinct [[habitat]]s like mountain vs. flatland. Floras can mean plant life of a historic era as in ''fossil flora''. Lastly, floras may be subdivided by special environments:

*''Native flora''. The native and indigenous flora of an area.
*''Agricultural and horticultural flora (garden flora)''. The plants that are deliberately grown by humans.
*''Weed flora''. Traditionally this classification was applied to plants regarded as undesirable, and studied in efforts to control or eradicate them.  Today the designation is less often used as a classification of plant life, since it includes three different types of plants: [[weed]]y species, [[invasive species]] (that may or may not be weedy), and native and introduced non-weedy species that are agriculturally undesirable.  Many native plants previously considered weeds have been shown to be beneficial or even necessary to various [[ecosystem]]s.

==Documentation of floras==
[[File:WGSRPD World.svg|thumb|upright=2|The botanical continents of the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]], used for classifying floras geographically]]
{{main article|Flora (publication)}}
&lt;!-- Images Begin --&gt;
[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|right|Floristic regions in Europe according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch]]
&lt;!-- Images End --&gt;

The flora of a particular area or time period can be documented in a publication also known as a "[[Flora (publication)|flora]]" (often capitalized as "Flora" to distinguish the two meanings when they might be confused). Floras may require specialist botanical knowledge to use with any effectiveness. Traditionally they are [[book]]s, but some are now published on [[CD-ROM]] or [[website]]s.

It is said that the ''[[Flora Sinensis]]'' by the Polish [[Jesuit]] [[Michał Boym]] was the first book that used the name "Flora" in this meaning, a book covering the plant world of a region.&lt;ref name=boym&gt;[http://webapps.fundp.ac.be/moretus/flora_sinensis/index_flora_sinensis.html Flora Sinensis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206180105/http://webapps.fundp.ac.be/moretus/flora_sinensis/index_flora_sinensis.html |date=2010-02-06 }} (access to the facsimile of the book, its French translation, and an article about it)&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its title it covered not only plants, but also some animals of the region.

A published flora often contains diagnostic keys. Often these are  [[identification key|''dichotomous'' keys]], which require the user to repeatedly examine a plant, and decide which one of two alternatives given best applies to the plant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7021">The '''[[Musical notation|notation]] of the [[guqin]]''' is a unique form of [[tablature]] for the Chinese [[musical instrument]], with a history of over 1,500 years, still in use today.

==History==
[[Image:Youlan.jpg|thumb|250px|left|《碣石調幽蘭第五》 "Jieshi Diao Youlan No.5" in longhand form.]] 
{{wikisourcelang|zh|碣石調幽蘭|"Jieshi Diao Youlan" 《碣石調幽蘭》}}
Written qin music did not directly tell what notes were played; instead, it was written in a [[tablature]] detailing tuning, finger positions, and stroke technique, thus comprising a step by step method and description of how to play a piece. Some tablatures do indicate notes using the [[gongche notation|gongche]] system, or indicate [[rhythm]] using [[wikt:dot|dots]]. The earliest example of the modern [[shorthand]] tablature survives from around the twelfth century CE. An earlier form of music notation from the Tang era survives in just one manuscript, dated to the seventh century CE, called [[Jieshi Diao Youlan]] 《碣石調幽蘭》 (Solitary Orchid in Stone Tablet Mode). It is written in a [[longhand]] form called ''wenzi pu'' 〔[[wiktionary:文|文]][[wiktionary:字|字]]譜〕 (literally "written notation"), said to have been created by Yongmen Zhou (雍門周) during the [[Warring States period]], which gives all the details using ordinary written [[Chinese characters]]. Later in the [[Tang dynasty]] Cao Rou (曹柔) and others simplified the notation, using only the important elements of the characters (like string number, plucking technique, ''hui'' number and which finger to stop the string) and combined them into one character [[Musical notation|notation]]. This meant that instead of having two lines of written text to describe a few notes, a single character could represent one [[note (music)|note]], or sometimes as many as nine. This notation form was called ''jianzi pu'' 〔[[wiktionary:減|減]]字譜〕 (literally "reduced notation") and it was a great advancement for recording qin pieces. It was so successful that from the [[Ming dynasty]] onwards, a great many '''qinpu''' 〔琴[[wiktionary:譜|譜]]〕 (qin tablature collections) appeared, the most famous and useful being "Shenqi Mipu" (The Mysterious and Marvellous Tablature) compiled by [[Zhu Quan]], the 17th son of the founder of the Ming dynasty {{ref|SQMP}}. In the 1960s, Zha Fuxi discovered more than 130 qinpu that contain well over 3360 pieces of written music. Sadly, many qinpu compiled before the Ming dynasty are now lost, and many pieces have remained unplayed for hundreds of years. {{ref|tab}}

==Development==
[[Image:Shenqi Mipu vol 3 pg 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|First page / leaf of volume 3 of Shenqi Mipu. From right to left: Full title of tablature collection 【臞仙神奇秘譜】 with volume number 下卷 (lower or third) plus seals of the owner of this copy (if any), title of the volume 霞外神品, the tuning and method of tuning 〈黃鐘調〉, name of the 'modal preface' 〔調意〕, the tablature (shorthand) of the modal preface, [next page] title of the piece, description of the piece's origins, and the tablature of said piece.]]

Major changes in the tablature happened during the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing period]]. Before, the recording of the note positions between ''hui'' were only approximations. For example, to play [[G (musical note)|sol]] on the seventh string, the position the player must stop is between the 7th and 8th hui. The tablature of Ming times would only say "between 7 and 8" 「七八日([[wiktionary:間|間]])」 or for other positions "below 6" 「六下」 or even say "11" 「十一」 (when the correct position is slightly higher). During the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]], this was replaced by the [[Decimal|decimal system]]. The space between two hui were split into 10 'fen' 〔[[wiktionary:分|分]]〕, so the tablature can indicate the correct position of notes more accurately, so for the examples above, the correct positions are 7.6, 6.2 and 10.8 respectively. Some even went further to split one fen into a further 10 'li' 〔[[wiktionary:釐|釐]]/[[wiktionary:厘|厘]]〕, but since the distance is too minute to affect the pitch to a large degree, it was considered impractical to use. Some people argue that the old system is just as accurate as the new system when qin tuning theory is observed.{{ref|position}} Also, these old positions may actually conform to the rules of [[equal temperament|equally tempered]] music, with its pitches slightly flatter, such as in the case of 8 for 7.9 and 11 for 10.8. Another main property for this old system is that it requires the player to "feel for the note", just as one would do for any other fretless stringed instrument, be it [[erhu]] or [[violin]], instead of relying solely on fixed positions (which pitches can change slightly depending on how the player tunes their qin).

Existing qinpu generally come from private collections or in [[public libraries]] throughout China, etc. Those that are available for public purchase are [[facsimile]] qinpu printed and bound in the [[traditional Chinese bookbinding]] process. More modern qinpu tend to be bound in the normal Western way on modern paper. The format uses qin notation with [[staff notation]] and/or [[jianpu]] notation.

===Modern developments===
A number of efforts have been made to further develop qin tablature. A book by Wang Guangqi (王光祈) uses [[Roman numerals|Roman]] and [[Arabic numerals]] to express the information provided by qin tablature. The qin player, [[Gong Yi]], developed a format using [[staff notation]] combined with some tablature marks {{ref|gongyi}}. Others have tried to write a [[computer program]] that will do this. Chen Changlin, a Beijing-based [[computer scientist]] and qin player of the Min (Fujian) School, developed the first computer program to encode qin notation from ancient tablature sources. {{ref|notation}}

The current practice for recording qin scores is to use jianzipu notation together with staff and/or cipher notation so the playing method is preserved and the rhythm, note value, etc is also shown.

[[File:Helix of sustainability.png|left|thumb|The helix of sustainability - the [[Carbon cycle]] ideal for manufacture and use]][[File:Recycle001.svg|thumb|left|The international [[recycling symbol]] - not nature identical.]]

The '''helix of sustainability''' is a concept coined to help manufacturing industry move to more sustainable practices by mapping its models of raw material use and reuse onto those of nature.The environmental benefits of the use crop origin sustainable materials have been assumed to be self-evident, but as the debate on [[food vs fuel]] shows, the whole product life cycle must be examined in the light of social and environmental effects in addition to technical suitability and profitability.

In 2004 the concept was presented by Professor John Wood, then Chair of the Materials Foresight Panel at a [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] event hosted by the then Secretary of State for Industry ([[Jacqui Smith]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Opportunities in Horticulture: A Proposal for Academic Posts in WMG", WMG Report, David Mullins, 26 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year it was also used in the [[European Science Foundation]] exploratory workshop on environmentally friendly composites.&lt;ref&gt;"Environmentally Friendly European Composites Workshop", K Kirwan, N Tucker, M Johnson, C Halstead, D Jacobs, Report, European Science Foundation, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

The advantages of working with crop origin raw materials are readily observed if the social and environmental impacts are considered as well as monetary cost (the [[Triple bottom line]]), and the helix of sustainability helps to demonstrate this. For the full potential of biopolymers to be realised it is essential that attention is paid to every aspect of the manufacturing process from design (how to cope with the incertainties in properties associated with crop origin materials?), manufacture (can existing technologies be used?), through to end-of-life (can the redundant article be fed back into the materials cycle?).    
The entire supply chain must be considered because decisions taken at the design stage have significant effects right through the life of an article. Low cost assembly techniques (e.g. snap-fits) may make dismantling or repair uneconomical. However, if say, an easy-to-dismantle car is built, will there be any effect on the ability of the vehicle to absorb energy in a crash? At an even more fundamental level, what will be the social and environmental of the change in crop growing patterns. This low environmental impact approach to manufacturing is seen as an extension of [[waste reduction]] techniques such as [[lean manufacturing]]. 

Conventional [[Recycling|cycles of use and reuse]] are circular. Consider the mechanical recovery of conventional [[polymers]]. A complex [[infrastructure]] is needed to recover the material at the end of an article's useful life. At the end of an article's life - say a [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] carbonated drink bottle, the article must be separated from the waste stream, either by the consumer who throws it away, or by manual labour at the rubbish dump. It must then be transported to some facility to be reprocessed (using more labour and energy) back into a raw material. The [[Plastics extrusion|heat and shear forces]] associated with the process of remanufacture tends to produce material with slightly degraded properties compared to the original material.

For sustainable material articles there is not such a great requirement for a dedicated recovery infrastructure. If a [[Litter|litter lout]] throws a crop origin [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] article on the ground, it will ultimately biodegrade into [[humus]], water, and non-fossil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If the article is placed into a [[compostable]] waste stream, the humus can then be used as fertiliser for the next generation of crops, there is also no requirement to sort  biopolymer articles as there is with fossil polymer recycling. Note difference between [[landfill]] and [[compost]] - the limited biological activity in landfill is slow, and mostly [[Wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] resulting in the production of [[methane]], whereas [[composting]] is a rapid [[Decomposition|aerobic]] process resulting in humus, water and non-fossil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The energy bill for breaking down biodegradables into the fundamental building block molecules, and then reassembling them into usable raw materials is large, but is  uses direct solar energy rather than metered electricity. There is also no loss of properties with successive journeys through the cycle.

'''Herodian architecture''' is a style of [[classical architecture]] characteristic of the numerous building projects undertaken during the reign (37–4 BC) of [[Herod the Great]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[client king]] of [[Iudaea Province#The client kingdom of Judea|Judea]]. Herod undertook many colossal building projects, most famously his [[Herod's Temple|reconstruction]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] (c. 19 BC). Many of his structures were built upon comparable, previous [[Hasmonean]] buildings and most of his have, in their turn, vanished as well.

==Innovations==
Herod introduced numerous architectural innovations and construction techniques in his buildings, such as the domes inside the [[Huldah Gates|Double Gate]] to the [[Temple Mount]]. He adapted the ''[[mikveh]]'' — a Jewish ritual bath — for use as the [[frigidarium]] in the Roman-style bathhouses in his many palaces. Herod also developed an innovative combination of palace and fortress; examples include the [[Antonia Fortress]] in Jerusalem, the [[Herodium]] in the [[Judean Desert]] about 2 miles south of [[Bethlehem]], and [[Masada]]. Characteristically, they have (or had) one tower higher and stronger than the others. Herod’s fortification innovations strongly influenced the military architecture of subsequent generations.

In line with contemporary Jewish customs, Herod generally avoided the representation of human and animal figures, even in the closed and private parts of his palaces.&lt;ref&gt;A few exceptions are recorded. [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Herod's Palace]] reportedly had bronze figures (probably animals) through which water was dispensed. (Levine, p. 200 cf. [[Josephus]], [[The Jewish War|War.]] 5.4) More notably, near the end of his reign, Herod erected a golden eagle above the gate of the Temple. The outrage this caused within the city was demonstrated when several youths removed and destroyed the eagle. They were subsequently executed. (Levine, p. 180 cf. Josephus, [[Antiquities of the Jews|Ant.]] 17.6)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herod's Temple==
{{main article|Herod's Temple}}
In the eighteenth year of his reign (20–19 BC), Herod rebuilt the [[Second Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] on "a more magnificent scale".&lt;ref name=temple&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=123&amp;letter=T&amp;search=Herod's%20Temple Temple of Herod], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The new Temple was finished in a year and a half, although work on out-buildings and courts continued another eighty years. To comply with religious law, Herod employed a thousand priests as masons and carpenters for the rebuilding. The finished temple, which was destroyed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 70 AD, is often referred to as [[Herod's Temple]]. [[The Wailing Wall]] (Western Wall) in Jerusalem was for many years the only section visible of the four retaining walls whose construction was begun by Herod to create a flat platform (the [[Temple Mount]]) upon which his Temple was constructed. Recent findings suggest that the Temple Mount walls and [[Robinson's Arch]] may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death during the reign of [[Herod Agrippa II]].&lt;ref name=Western&gt;{{cite web|title=Building the Western Wall: Herod Began it but Didn’t Finish it (december 2011)|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/Article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1882&amp;hist=1|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herod's palace-fortresses==
Herod constructed several lavish palace-fortresses within his kingdom, most notably at [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem]], [[Herod's Palace (Herodium)|Herodium]], [[Masada]], and [[Caesarea Maritima]].

==Herodian masonry==
[[File:Nidbach Raba IMG 2681.JPG|thumb|180px|left|Detail of the distinctive pattern of Herodian stone-dressing as seen in the [[Western Wall Tunnel]].]]

Herod’s massive building projects featured a distinctive style of [[stone-dressing]]. This stone-dressing method — usually featuring the pale local ''[[meleke]]'' limestone — was so prominently practiced in Herod's day that it has led to such terms as “Herodian blocks”, “Herodian masonry”, “Herodian dressing”, and the like. It makes Herodian stones easily discernible from the earlier stone courses below, and later ones above, in the surviving walls at many sites. Best known is the example of the impressive retaining walls of the Temple Mount, readily visible at the [[Western Wall]].

Enormous quantities of stone were needed for these structures and the remains of the numerous quarries used can still be found, especially in the vicinity of Jerusalem’s Old City, notably those to the north known as [[Solomon's Quarries]]. Freeing the stones from the bedrock was an elaborate process: Wide grooves were chiseled with metal tools around the intended stone block. The block was then freed up by driving metal wedges into the grooves. The initial dressing of the stone was probably accomplished on site before transport. Many of these stones were very large, weighing between two and five tons. (The [[Western Stone|largest found]], in the [[Western Wall Tunnel]], measures some 12.8 meters in length, 3.4 meters high and 4.3 meters deep; it weighs about 660 tons.) Once moved to the building site,  further fine chiseling was done and the blocks were hauled into place using ramps, cranes and crow bars. The stones were laid in dry courses, typically about 1 meter high without the use of any mortar. Each course was set 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;cm back from the course underneath it. Final dressing and refinements were carried out once the stones had been set in place.

The huge rectangular building blocks, laid in horizontal courses, feature flat, projecting central portions ([[Boss (architecture)|boss]]es) surrounded by narrow, shallow dressed margins (“marginal drafts”) creating a finely chiseled, frame-like effect. The depressed “frame” is sunk some 2 centimeters below the smooth face of the stone and its average width is about 8 centimeters. A wide, toothed chisel was used to smooth the stone margins.

The origins of this margin-cutting style predate Herod, as witnessed by the [[Hellenistic architecture]] of [[Alexandria]], [[Asia Minor]], and [[Greece]] itself, as well as by examples in the [[Levant]] (e.g., the palace of the Sons of Tuvia at [[Iraq]], el-Amir in [[Jordan]] (near [[Amman]]), dating from at least the 3rd century BC). Examples of pre-Herodian margin stone-cutting are also attested in Jerusalem itself: at the “[[Tower of David]]” (the Paza’el Tower), in the "[[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period#Hasmonean Kingdom|First city wall]]" and in the [[Israelite Tower|Hasmonean Tower]] unearthed in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]]. Authentic “Herodian masonry” includes examples at the sites at [[Hebron]] (Elonei Mamre,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visitpalestine.ps/mamre-archaeological-site-in-the-middle-of-hebron/|title=Mamre: Archaeological Site in the Middle of Hebron - VisitPalestine|date=2015-10-10|website=VisitPalestine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cave of Machpelah]]), in the [[Augusteum]] in [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]] and possibly also in the Herodian platform at [[Caesarea Maritima]]. In Jerusalem, in addition to the [[Temple Mount]], Herodian stones are preserved beneath the [[Damascus Gate]]. It has been observed that this distinctive stone-dressing style serves as a decorative theme on Second Temple period [[ossuaries]] found in the Jerusalem area.

Yellow cedar (''[[Cupressus nootkatensis]]'') is a culturally, economically and environmentally significant species to the Pacific Northwest and was used extensively by indigenous peoples throughout the region.

==History==
===Archaeological Evidence of Use===
At the [[Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site]] in Washington, cedar (either yellow or red) wood, bark, and roots, along with the remains of cedar houses were found all dating between 300 and 500 years ago. On the east coast of Vancouver island at the Little Qualicum River site cedar (either yellow or red) rope, matting, and a canoe bailer were found dating to approximately 1000 years ago. At the Lachane site in Prince Rupert harbor many cedar (either yellow or red) wooden items and bark baskets were found dating to approximately 2000 years ago. At the Pitt River site near Vancouver two carved cedar (either yellow or red) items and baskets were found, dating to approximately 2900 years ago. At the Musqueam site near Vancouver cedar (either yellow or red) basketry, matting, ropes were found dating to 3000 years ago. At various other sites around Vancouver wood working tools have been found that date from between 5000 and 8000 years ago that could possibly have been intended to be used for cedar (either yellow or red).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legends===
====[[Tlingit]]====
Natsilane was a great hunter and carver. He also hunted with respect for the sea lions he killed. His older brothers-in-law were jealous of his talents. One day when they had paddled far out to a sea lion rock to hunt, Natsilane speared a sea lion but it dove into the water breaking off the spear tip. When he looked back to the canoe, his older brothers-in-law were paddling away, against the protests of his youngest brother-in-law. Natsilane in despair went to sleep on the rock, and was awaked by the chief of the sea lions. He was brought to live in their village beneath the sea. It turned out that he had speared the sea lion chief's son, so Natsilane saved the boy by removing the spearhead from his side. In thanks, the sea lions sent him home in an inflated sealskin bladder. Once home, he visited his wife in secret and had her bring him his carving tools. He set about carving a killer whale, an animal that had yet to exist. First he tried spruce, but that sank when he placed it in a tide pool. Next, he tried hemlock, which also sank. He then tried red cedar, which circled, but then also came to rest on the bottom of the pool. Finally, he tried yellow cedar, his best carving yet. This jumped from the tide pool out to sea. He called the first killer whale back to him and told it to kill his older brothers-in-law when they next went in their canoe to hunt, but to save the youngest brother-in-law. The killer whale capsized the canoe, drowning the older brothers-in-law but brought the youngest back to shore on its back. When the killer whale returned, Natsilane instructed the whale to never again harm humans.&lt;ref&gt;Giraudo Beck 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caduto 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hesquiat====
Raven the trickster came upon three young women drying salmon on the beach. Being hungry, and interested in stealing their salmon he asked them if they were afraid of being alone. They answered no, so he asked if they were afraid of bears, to which they also answered no. He went through a long list of animals, all of which the young women said they were not afraid of until he mentioned owls. The women confessed they were very afraid of owls. Raven walked away and hid himself in some bushes nearby, where he began to mimic owl calls. The women were terrified, and ran up the mountainside. When they were halfway up and could run no more, they turned into yellow cedar trees. This is said to be why cedars are beautiful, growing silky bark like a woman's hair, graceful limbs, and why their young trunks are smooth to touch. This is also why they grow high on the slopes of Vancouver Island.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wood==
Yellow cedar's common name comes from the color of its wood, which is pale yellow. The wood is durable, fine grained, contains a natural preservative, and does not split as easily as red cedar, making it very suitable for carving.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; it is also lightweight, pliable, yet strong, and was used to make paddles, fishing floats, rattles, ceremonial masks, speaker's staffs which were used as a badge of office for an announcer at events, bentwood bowls, totem poles, and longhouses. [[Bentwood]] boxes were made by using steam to bend a single plank of red cedar into four sides of a box, and then using yellow cedar pegs to join the corner. These boxes were highly prized and thus were a valuable trade item. They could be used to hold and store goods, or as coffins for the deceased. [[Salish peoples|Salish]] Hunters used yellow cedar saplings to make bows which were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;Huang, "Cedar."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Bill Reid Raven (UBC-2010a).jpg|thumb|Bill Reid Raven (UBC-2010a)]] [[File:Richard Carpenter bent-wood chest detail 01.jpg|thumb|Richard Carpenter bent-wood chest detail 01]]

===Harvesting===
Harvesting of trees was typically done from late summer to early spring. This was to avoid the time when the sap was up as it sped the rotting of the tree.

====Felling a Tree By Burning and Adzing====

A cavity was chiseled into the tree with an adze, and then red hot rocks were applied for controlled burning, with wet hemlock branches placed around the cavity to control the spread of the burn. The tree feller would chop away the charcoal, renewing the treatment of hot rocks as needed.

====Felling a Tree By Burning====

Fire was applied to the base of the tree. A ring of wet clay circled the tree above the fire to control burning.

====Felling a Tree With Hammer, Wedge, and Maul====

A scaffold and platform was built around the tree above the flaring roots. Two chiseled grooves about one foot apart were made around the tree and then the wood between cut away with a hammer and maul. The process was repeated until the tree fell.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 37-40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==

===Hammer===
The earliest form of the hammer used when carving yellow cedar was the hammer stone, a hard rock worn smooth by water that was resistant to cracking or flaking. Northern and Southern peoples later developed their own respective hammers. Southern peoples used the hand maul which was held directly in the hand, while northern nations ([[Tsimshian]], [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tlingit]]) used hafted mauls, which were heavy stone heads lashed onto a long haft, similar to a sledge hammer. Many of the stone mauls were sculpted as animal figurines.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wedge===
Wedges when hammered were used to split cedar logs into planks. A variety of woods including yew, spruce, maple, and crabapple were used as wedges. The wood was beveled on one end to allow it to be driven into the cedar, and then scorched to improve its hardness. Animal fat was rubbed into the wood to prevent warping, and a cedar with was twisted around the top end to prevent splitting when struck with a hammer. Antler was also historically used as an alternative to wood wedges.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Adze]]===
The most universal adze was the elbow adze, named for its shape. Metal blades have been found on adzes for several hundred years, and currently very little evidence of stone blades usage exists. Elbow adzes were used for chopping and rough shaping, and were typically used on large works. D adzes were also used from Vancouver island southward. Their name comes from the shape of their haft, which were often carved to represent animals. The D adze was used for finer work and for finishing.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Tools===
Chisels, scrapers, knives, awls, and sandstones to keep the tools sharp were important additional components of a woodcarver's tool chest.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Hibulb Cultural Center - watertight cedar basket c. 1920 (20873657113).jpg|thumb|Hibulb Cultural Center - watertight cedar basket c. 1920 (20873657113)]]

==Bark==
The inner bark of yellow cedar was valued over the inner bark of red cedar because it is more durable.  The inner bark is very versatile and could be dyed and used as different types of thread to create mats, clothing, blankets, basketry, fishing nets, ropes, and hats, the bark is also soft and absorbent, and was used for diapers, sanitary napkins, and bedding as well.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt; Yellow cedar was the only bark used for the core of the warp for [[Chilkat weaving]], due to its strength.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvesting===
Bark was cut and pulled as soon as the sap began to run, which varied regionally from late May to July.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; While carving was typically done by men, the harvesting of bark was performed by women. Straight young trees were chosen, and only a portion was debarked to ensure the tree's survival. Thousands of culturally modified trees with scars from past bark harvesting can now be found along the Pacific Northwest coastline.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt; On the side with the fewest branches, above the flare of the tree's roots, a woman would make a horizontal cut the width of two fingers. She would make a small vertical cut then on either end of the horizontal cut. She would then use a small wedge to pry the bark away from the trunk enough for her to grip securely. Holding this end of the bark, she would then walk away from the tree slowly, drawing a ribbon of bark off the tree. For the bark quality to prove good for weaving, the strip should run at least twenty feet before narrowing to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roots==
Roots could be dried and then braided to form cords for weaving hats or basketry. Using specific techniques, the baskets could be made water and heat proof, and could be used as cookware.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;

==Withes==
Withes were used to create strong cords for lashing and ropes. They were a valuable construction tool, and were often used in place nails or bolts. Because of their strength, they were also used to create burden baskets for heavy loads.

An '''Intermediate power amplifier''' (IPA) is one stage of the [[amplifier|amplification]] process in a [[Transmitter|radio transmitter]] which usually occurs prior to the final high power amplification. The IPA provides lower power [[Radio frequency|RF]] energy necessary to drive the final. In very high power transmitters, such as 10 [[kilowatt]]s and above, multiple IPAs are combined to provide enough drive for the final.

An [[Transmitter#Broadcasting|exciter]], an even lower power transmitter, provides a similar service to the IPA by driving it; although an exciter usually encompasses other important functions, such as choosing the frequency of the RF.

'''Khimera''' is a software product from Kintech Lab intended for calculation of the kinetic parameters of microscopic processes, thermodynamic and transport properties of substances and their mixtures in gases, plasmas and also of heterogeneous processes.
The development of a kinetic mechanism is a key stage of present-day technologies for the creation of hi-tech devices and processes in a wide range of fields, such as microelectronics, chemical industry, and the design and optimization of combustion engines and power stations.
Khimera with [[Chemical WorkBench]], another software product from [[Kintech Lab]], allows both the development of complex physical and chemical mechanisms and their validation. Essential feature of Khimera is its user-friendly interface for importing and utilizing the results of quantum-chemical calculations for estimating rate constants of elementary processes and thermodynamic and transport properties.

==Fields of Application==
Khimera incorporates up to date achievements in the development of the wide range of models of elementary physicochemical processes; these models are of particular importance for hi-tech applications in:
*microelectronics
*materials science
*chemical industry
*automobile and aviation industry
*power engineering.

==Basic Capabilities==
The computation modules of Khimera allow one to calculate the kinetic parameters of elementary processes and thermodynamic and transport properties from the data on the molecular structures and properties obtained from quantum-chemical calculations or from an experiment. The molecular properties and the parameters of molecular interactions can be calculated using quantum-chemical software ([[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]], [[GAMESS (disambiguation)|GAMESS]], [[Jaguar (software)|Jaguar]], [[Amsterdam Density Functional|ADF]]) and directly imported into Khimera in an automatic mode.  The results of calculations can be presented visually and exported for the further use in kinetic modeling and CFD packages.

'''Kinesiology''' is the scientific study of human or non-human body movement. Kinesiology addresses physiological, biomechanical, and psychological dynamic principles and mechanisms of movement. Applications of kinesiology to human health (i.e., '''human kinesiology''') include [[biomechanics]] and [[orthopedics]]; strength and conditioning; [[sport psychology]]; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise. Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, [[electrophysiology]] of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Bodo Rosenhahn, Reinhard Klette and Dimitris Metaxas (eds.). Human Motion - Understanding, Modelling, Capture and Animation. Volume 36 in ''Computational Imaging and Vision'', Springer, Dordrecht, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Elgammal, Bodo Rosenhahn, and Reinhard Klette (eds.) Human Motion - Understanding, Modelling, Capture and Animation. 2nd Workshop, in conjunction with ICCV 2007, Rio de Janeiro, ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', LNCS 4814, Springer, Berlin, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κίνησις}} ''kínēsis'', "movement" (itself from κινεῖν ''kineîn'', "to move"), and -λογία ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'', "study".

== Basics ==
Kinesiology is the study of human and nonhuman animal-body movements, performance, and function by applying the sciences of [[biomechanics]], [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[psychology]], and [[neuroscience]]. Applications of kinesiology in human-health include physical education teacher, rehabilitation, health and safety, health promotion, workplaces, sport and exercise industries. A bachelor's degree in kinesiology can provide strong preparation for graduate study in biomedical research, as well as in professional programs, such as medicine.

Whereas the term "kinesiologist" is neither a licensed nor professional designation in the United States nor most countries (with the exception of Canada), individuals with training in this area can teach physical education, provide consulting services, conduct research and develop policies related to rehabilitation, human motor performance, [[ergonomics]], and occupational health and safety. In North America, kinesiologists may study to earn a [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Science]], or [[Doctorate of Philosophy]] degree in Kinesiology or a [[Bachelor's degree#Kinesiology|Bachelor of Kinesiology]] degree, while in Australia or New Zealand, they are often conferred an Applied Science (Human Movement) degree (or higher). Many doctoral level faculty in North American kinesiology programs received their doctoral training in related disciplines, such as neuroscience, mechanical engineering, psychology, and physiology.

The world's first kinesiology department was launched in 1967 at the [[University of Waterloo]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahs.uwaterloo.ca/kin/|title=Home - Kinesiology|author=|date=20 August 2012|website=uwaterloo.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021063436/http://www.ahs.uwaterloo.ca/kin/|archivedate=21 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neuroplasticity]] is also a key scientific principle used in kinesiology to describe how movement and changes in the brain are related. The human brain adapts and acquires new motor skills based on this principle, which includes both adaptive and maladaptive brain changes.

=== Motor redundancy ===
[[File:Motor Redundancy Animation.gif|300px|thumb|left|Animation illustrating the concept of motor redundancy: the motor action of bringing the finger in contact with a point in space can be achieved using a wide variety of limb configurations.]]

Motor redundancy is a widely used concept in kinesiology and [[motor control]] which states that, for any task the human body can perform, there are effectively an unlimited number of ways the nervous system could achieve that task.&lt;ref name=Bernstein1967&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bernstein|first=Nikolai|title=The Co-ordination and Regulation of Movement| year=1967|publisher=Permagon Press|location=Long Island City, NY|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; This redundancy appears at multiple levels in the chain of motor execution:

* [[kinematics|Kinematic]] redundancy means that for a desired location of the endpoint (e.g. the hand or finger), there are many configurations of the joints that would produce the same endpoint location in space.
* [[Muscle]] redundancy means that the same net joint [[torque]] could be generated by many different relative contributions of individual muscles.
* [[Motor unit]] redundancy means that for the same net muscle [[force]] could be generated by many different relative contributions of motor units within that muscle.

The concept of motor redundancy is explored in numerous studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Latash|first=ML|author2=Scholz, JP |author3=Schöner, G |title=Motor control strategies revealed in the structure of motor variability.|journal=Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews|date=January 2002|volume=30|issue=1|pages=26–31|pmid=11800496|doi=10.1097/00003677-200201000-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tresch|first=MC|author2=Jarc, A |title=The case for and against muscle synergies.|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|date=December 2009|volume=19|issue=6|pages=601–7|pmid=19828310|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2009.09.002|pmc=2818278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=todorov2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todorov|first=E|author2=Jordan, MI |title=Optimal feedback control as a theory of motor coordination.|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=November 2002|volume=5|issue=11|pages=1226–35|pmid=12404008|doi=10.1038/nn963}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually with the goal of describing the relative contribution of a set of motor elements (e.g. muscles) in various human movements, and how these contributions can be predicted from a comprehensive theory.

== Scope of practice ==
In Canada, kinesiology is a professional designation as well as an area of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oka.on.ca/ |title=Welcome to the Ontario Kinesiology Association |publisher=Oka.on.ca |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924214553/http://www.oka.on.ca/ |archivedate=2008-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the province of Ontario the scope has been officially defined as, "the assessment of human movement and performance and its rehabilitation and management to maintain, rehabilitate or enhance movement and performance" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_07k10_e.htm|title=Law Document English View|author=|date=24 July 2014|website=gov.on.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403094418/http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_07k10_e.htm|archivedate=3 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinesiologists work in a variety of roles as health professionals. They work as rehabilitation providers in hospitals, clinics and private settings working with populations needing care for musculoskeletal, cardiac and neurological conditions. They provide rehabilitation to persons injured at work and in vehicular accidents. Kinesiologists also work as functional assessment specialists, exercise therapists, ergonomists, return to work specialists, case managers and medical legal evaluators. They can be found in hospital, long term care, clinic, work, and community settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hprac.org/en/reports/resources/New_Directions_April_2006_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628061020/http://www.hprac.org/en/reports/resources/New_Directions_April_2006_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-28 |df= }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, kinesiology is applied in areas of health and fitness for all levels of athletes, but more often found with training of elite athletes.

== Licensing and regulation ==

=== Canada ===
In Canada, Kinesiology has been designated a regulated health profession in [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=S. J.|title=Introduction to Kinesiology|editor=Shirl J.

The [[College of Kinesiologists of Ontario]] achieved proclamation on April 1, 2013, at which time the professional title "Kinesiologist" became protected by law. In Ontario only members of the college may call themselves a Registered Kinesiologist.
Individuals who have earned degrees in kinesiology can work in research, the fitness industry, clinical settings, and in industrial environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cka.ca/kinesiology.php |title=CKA - Canadian Kinesiology Alliance - Alliance Canadienne de Kinésiologie |publisher=Cka.ca |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318005051/http://www.cka.ca/kinesiology.php |archivedate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also work in cardiac rehabilitation, health and safety, hospital and long-term care facilities and community health centers just to name a few.

== History of Kinesiology ==
[[File:NilsPosse.png|600px|thumb|In 1886, Swedish baron Nils Posse (1862-1895) introduced the term Kinesiology in the U.S.A., 1894 he wrote the book "The Special Kinesiology of Educational Gymnastics". Nils Posse was a graduate of the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute in Stockholm, Sweden and founder of the Posse Gymnasium, Boston, MA.]]

[[Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics]] ([[:sv:Gymnastik- och idrottshögskolan|sv]]) G.C.I. was founded 1813 in Stockholm, Sweden by [[Pehr Henrik Ling]]. It was the first [[Physiotherapy]] School in the world, training hundreds of medical gymnasts who spread the Swedish physical therapy around the entire world. 
In 1887, Sweden was the first country in the world to give a national state licence to physiotherapists/physical therapists.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ottosson|first=Anders|date=2010|title=The First Historical Movements of Kinesiology: Scientification in the Borderline between Physical Culture and Medicine around 1850|journal=The International Journal of the History of Sport|volume= 27| issue = 11|pages=1892–1919|doi=10.1080/09523367.2010.491618|pmid=20653114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish medical gymnast and [[kinesiologist]] [[Carl August Georgii]] ([[:sv:August Georgii|sv]]), Professor at the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute GCI in Stockholm, was the one who created and coined the new international word '''Kinesiology''' in 1854.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The term ''Kinesiology'' is a literal translation to Greek+English from the original Swedish word ''Rörelselära'', meaning "Movement Science". It was the foundation of the Medical Gymnastics, the original [[Physiotherapy]] and [[Physical Therapy]], developed during 100 years in Sweden (starting 1813).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
 
The new medical therapy created in Sweden was originally called [[Rörelselära]] ([[:sv:Rörelselära|sv]]), and later in 1854 translated to the new and invented international word "Kinesiology". 
The Kinesiology consisted of nearly 2,000 physical movements and 50 different types of massage therapy techniques. 
They were all used to affect various dysfunctions and even illnesses, not only in the movement apparatus, but also into the internal physiology of man. 
Thus, the original classical and Traditional Kinesiology was not only a system of rehabilitation for the body, or biomechanics like in modern Academic Kinesiology, but also a new therapy for relieving and curing diseases, by affecting the autonomic nervous system, organs and glands in the body.,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sjukgymnasten - vart tog han vägen?

In 1886, the Swedish Medical Gymnast [[Nils Posse]] (1862-1895) introduced the term kinesiology in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2005/np2005zq.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911234740/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2005/np2005zq.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nils Posse was a graduate of the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute in Stockholm, Sweden and founder of the Posse Gymnasium in Boston, MA. He was teaching at [[Boston Normal School of Gymnastics]] BNSG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kinesiology.com/image/NilsPosse.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107034519/http://kinesiology.com/image/NilsPosse.png |archivedate=2017-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Special Kinesiology Of Educational Gymnastics'' was the first book ever written in the world with the word "Kinesiology" in the title of the book. It was written by Nils Posse and published in Boston, 1894-1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinesiology.com/|title=Kinesiology.com - manual muscle testing MMT|first=Mac Pompeius Wolontis,|last=www.Kinesiology.com|date=|website=kinesiology.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107072051/http://www.kinesiology.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology in Kinesiology ==
Motion capture technology has application in measuring human movement, and thus kinesiology. Historically, motion capture labs have recorded high fidelity data.&lt;ref name="Motion capture"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-01-16|title=Motion capture|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Motion_capture&amp;oldid=820735073|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While accurate and credible, these systems can come at high capital and operational costs. Modern-day systems have increased accessibility to mocap technology.&lt;ref name="Motion capture"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5407">'''Meteorological intelligence''' is [[information]] measured, gathered, compiled, exploited, analyzed and disseminated by [[Meteorology|meteorologists]], [[Climatology|climatologists]] and [[Hydrology|hydrologists]] to characterize the current state and/or predict the future state of the [[atmosphere]] at a given location and time.  Meteorological intelligence is a subset of [[environmental intelligence]] and is synonymous with the term [[weather intelligence]].  

The earliest known use of the term "meteorological intelligence" in a written document dates to 1854 on pg. 168 of the Eighth Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  This report discusses the Smithsonian Institution's initiative to transmit meteorological intelligence via [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] lines.  An early reference to "meteorological intelligence" in England dates an 1866 issue of [[Edinburgh Review|The Edinburgh Review]] which was a prominent [[Scottish people|Scottish]] journal during the 19th century (Reeve 1866, pg. 75).  

Another documented, early use of the term dates to 1874 in a historical compilation entitled, "The American Historical Record" (Lossing 1874, pg. 125).  In this book, Lossing uses the term to refer to weather observations transmitted over telegraph lines for the purpose of studying the nature of [[storm]]s with the ultimate goal of enhancing public safety through the issuance of storm warnings.  This mission was carried out by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Service]] starting in the 1870s who was responsible for communication (via telegraph) of technical [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for the army as well as "meteorological intelligence" for the general welfare of the country (Ingersoll 1879, pg. 156).

From the viewpoint of the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence community]], the term meteorological intelligence is more limited in its use referring to the use of [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] or technical means to learn about environmental conditions over enemy territory (Shulsky and Schmitt 2002) as in the [[North Atlantic weather war]]. In the [[military intelligence]] context, weather information is often referred to as meteorological or environmental intelligence (Hinsley 1990, pg. 420; Platt 1957, pg. 14; U.S. Congress, pg. 164). 

With regard to private sector [[meteorology]], the term meteorological intelligence is a broad term of art that is primarily associated with observed and forecast weather information provided to decision makers in one of a number of weather sensitive business areas including: Energy, [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[transport]]ation, [[aviation]], [[entertainment]], [[Retailing|retail]] and [[construction]] (CMOS 2001, pg. 23) .  It is considered a key aspect of [[weather risk management]] for the legal and [[insurance]] industries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10041">In [[computing]], especially [[digital signal processing]], the '''multiply–accumulate operation''' is a common step that computes the product of two numbers and adds that product to an [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]].  The hardware unit that performs the operation is known as a '''multiplier–accumulator''' ('''MAC''', or '''MAC unit'''); the operation itself is also often called a MAC or a MAC operation.  The MAC operation modifies an accumulator ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt;\ a \leftarrow a + ( b \times c )&lt;/math&gt;

When done with [[floating point]] numbers, it might be performed with two [[rounding]]s (typical in many [[digital signal processors|DSP]]s), or with a single rounding.  When performed with a single rounding, it is called a '''fused multiply–add''' ('''FMA''') or '''fused multiply–accumulate''' ('''FMAC''').

Modern computers may contain a dedicated MAC, consisting of a multiplier implemented in [[combinational logic]] followed by an [[adder (electronics)|adder]] and an accumulator register that stores the result. The output of the register is fed back to one input of the adder, so that on each clock cycle, the output of the multiplier is added to the register. Combinational multipliers require a large amount of logic, but can compute a product much more quickly than the [[peasant multiplication|method of shifting and adding]] typical of earlier computers. The first processors to be equipped with MAC units were [[digital signal processor]]s, but the technique is now also common in general-purpose processors.

==In floating-point arithmetic==
When done with [[integer]]s, the operation is typically exact (computed [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] some [[power of two]]). However, [[floating-point]] numbers have only a certain amount of mathematical [[arithmetic precision|precision]]. That is, digital floating-point arithmetic is generally not [[associativity|associative]] or [[distributivity|distributive]]. (See [[Floating point#Accuracy problems]].)
Therefore, it makes a difference to the result whether the multiply–add is performed with two roundings, or in one operation with a single rounding (a fused multiply–add). [[IEEE 754-2008]] specifies that it must be performed with one rounding, yielding a more accurate result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/cuda/files/NVIDIA-CUDA-Floating-Point.pdf |title=Precision &amp; Performance: Floating Point and IEEE 754 Compliance for NVIDIA GPUs |publisher=nvidia |first1=Nathan |last1=Whitehead |first2=Alex |last2=Fit-Florea |year=2011 |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fused multiply–add==
A ''fused'' multiply–add (sometimes known as ''FMA'' or ''fmadd'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fmadd instrs|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.alangref/idalangref_fmadd_instrs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is a floating-point multiply–add operation performed in one step, with a single rounding. That is, where an unfused multiply–add would compute the product ''b''×''c'', round it to ''N'' significant bits, add the result to ''a'', and round back to ''N'' significant bits, a fused multiply–add would compute the entire expression ''a''+''b''×''c'' to its full precision before rounding the final result down to ''N'' significant bits.

A fast FMA can speed up and improve the accuracy of many computations that involve the accumulation of products:

* [[Dot product]]
* [[Matrix multiplication]]
* [[Polynomial]] evaluation (e.g., with [[Horner's rule]])
* [[Newton's method]] for evaluating functions.
* [[Convolutions]] and [[artificial neural networks]] 

Fused multiply–add can usually be relied on to give more accurate results. However, [[William Morton Kahan|William Kahan]] has pointed out that it can give problems if used unthinkingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic |author-first=William |author-last=Kahan |author-link=William Morton Kahan |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/ieee754.ps |date=1996-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is evaluated as {{math| ((''x''×''x'') − ''y''×''y'')}} using fused multiply–add, then the result may be negative even when {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''y''}} due to the first multiplication discarding low significance bits. This could then lead to an error if, for instance, the square root of the result is then evaluated.

When implemented inside a [[microprocessor]], an FMA can actually be faster than a multiply operation followed by an add.  However, standard industrial implementations based on the original IBM RS/6000 design require a 2''N''-bit adder to compute the sum properly.&lt;ref name="bridged"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~quinnell/Research/Bridged%20Floating-Point%20Fused%20Multiply-Add%20Design.pdf |title=Bridged Floating-Point Fused Multiply–Add Design |author-first=Eric |author-last=Quinnell&lt;!-- |date=undated, circa 2006 --&gt; |display-authors=etal}}{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/3082/quinnelle60861.pdf |date=May 2007 |title=Floating-Point Fused Multiply–Add Architectures |author-first=Eric |author-last=Quinnell |degree=PhD |access-date=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A useful benefit of including this instruction is that it allows an efficient software implementation of [[division (mathematics)|division]] (see [[division algorithm]]) and [[square root]] (see [[methods of computing square roots]]) operations, thus eliminating the need for dedicated hardware for those operations.&lt;ref name="goldschmidt_algo"&gt;{{cite web |citeseerx=10.1.1.85.9648 |title=Software Division and Square Root Using Goldschmidt's Algorithms |author-first=Peter |author-last=Markstein |date=November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dot product instruction===
Some machines combine multiple fused multiply add operations into a single step, e.g. performing a four-element dot-product on two 128-bit [[SIMD]] registers ''a0''×''b0''+''a1''×''b1''+''a2''×''b2''+''a3''×''b3'' with single cycle throughput.

===Support===
The FMA operation is included in [[IEEE 754-2008]].

The [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VAX]]'s POLY instruction is used for evaluating polynomials with [[Horner's rule]] using a succession of multiply and add steps.  Instruction descriptions do not specify whether the multiply and add are performed using a single fma step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uranium.vaxpower.org/~isildur/vax/week.html |title=VAX instruction of the week: POLY}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instruction has been a part of the VAX instruction set since its original 11/780 implementation in 1977.

The [[C99|1999 standard]] of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] supports the FMA operation through the &lt;code&gt;fma&lt;/code&gt; standard math library function, and standard pragmas controlling optimizations based on FMA.

The fused multiply–add operation was introduced as ''multiply–add fused'' in the IBM [[POWER1]] (1990) processor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-first1=R. K. |author-last1=Montoye |author-first2=E. |author-last2=Hokenek |author-first3=S. L. |author-last3=Runyon |url=http://domino.research.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/4ac37cf0bdc4dd6a85256547004d47e1/e3d1d5353695231c85256bfa0067fa31?OpenDocument |title=Design of the IBM RISC System/6000 floating-point execution unit |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=34 |issue=1 |date=January 1990 |pages=59–70 |issn=0018-8646 |doi=10.1147/rd.341.0059}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been added to numerous other processors since then:

The '''Napp Research Centre''' is a large medical research institute in the north of [[Cambridge]], and innovative-looking and award-winning architecture; it is a Cambridge [[landmark]].

==History==
Cambridge Science Park was built in the early 1970s and is part of the Napp Pharmaceutical Group, a pharmaceutical firm that manufactures analgesic, oncology and respiratory products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://napp.co.uk/products/patients Napp: Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

The grandiose innovative-looking building was designed in 1979, and was built in 1981. Staff moved in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in 1983. Three more buildings were added in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aukettswanke.com/projects/NAPP 2007 building]&lt;/ref&gt; Stage D, E and F1 were added in 2012, designed by CPN Architects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cpna-uk.com/projects/ 2012 buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] visited the building on 6 February 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 7 February 1985, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] visited the building on 19 October 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 21 October 1985, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1988, the site was visited by the [[List of Presidents of Turkey|seventh President of Turkey]], [[Kenan Evren]].&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 15 July 1988, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of kings of Jordan|King of Jordan]], [[Abdullah II of Jordan]], visited the site with [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] on 7 November 2001&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 8 November 2001, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; ; the visit also included [[Zeus Technology]].

The site works with [[Cambridge Academy for Science and Technology]], a [[University technical college|UTC]].

==Structure==
[[File:Cambridge Science Park Napp.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance in April 2011]]
The site is directly next to the [[A10 road (England)|A10]]/[[A14 road (England)|A14]] interchange, in [[South Cambridgeshire]].

==Awards==
In June 1984 it won [[The Concrete Society]]'s Award.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 14 June 1984, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5951">'''Neuroarthistory''' is a term coined by Professor [[John Onians]], an [[art history|art historian]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in 2005. Neuroarthistory is an approach that concerns the [[neurological]] study of artists, both living and dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2004 Onians taught the [[Postgraduate]] module "Art and the Brain" named after the 1999 paper by Professor [[Semir Zeki]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2005, he began working with Zeki, who is a professor of [[Neurobiology]] at [[University College London]] (and founder of Neuroesthetics) to study what goes on in the brains of artists. They used [[neuroimaging]] and studied the [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] processes of artists such as the [[painting|painters]] of the [[paleolithic]] [[Chauvet Cave]] art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, he wrote and presented the paper 'Neuroarthistory: making more sense of art' which, according to [[The Art Book]] "explored the ways in which our ever-expanding knowledge of the brain invites art historians to reconsider the interaction between the senses and cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In September 2006, Onians presented the results of the research to the [[BA Festival of Science]] in a lecture called 'Cracking the real Da Vinci Code: what happens in the artist’s brain?'.&lt;ref name="UEArelease"&gt;{{cite press release

The reason is that '[[Synaptic plasticity|neural plasticity]]' ensured that passive exposure to different natural and man-made environments caused the formation of different visual preferences."&lt;ref name="UEArelease"/&gt;

A book, ''Neuroarthistory: From Aristotle and Pliny to Baxandall and Zeki'' was published in 2008 by Yale University Press, discussing a number of [[case study|case studies]] from art history, and being the 'preface' to a further two books on the subject. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Political methodology''' is a subfield of [[Political science]] that studies the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] methods used to study politics. It combines [[statistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[formal theory (political science)|formal theory]]. Political methodology is often used for [[positive science|positive]] research, in contrast to [[normative]] research. It is similar to [[econometrics]].

== Journals ==

Political methodology is often published in the "top 3" journals ([http://www.apsanet.org/utils/journal.cfm?Journal=APSR&amp;CFID=31778852&amp;CFTOKEN=52017342 American Political Science Review], [http://ajps.org/ American Journal of Political Science], and [http://www.journalofpolitics.org/ Journal of Politics]), in sub-field journals, and in methods-focused journals.

The '''President's Medal''' is awarded annually by the [[British Academy]] to up to five individuals or organisations. It is awarded for "outstanding service to the cause of the humanities and social sciences". It cannot be awarded to [[Fellows of the British Academy]] and was created to reward "academic-related activity rather than academic achievement alone". The medals were first awarded in 2010.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|title=The British Academy President's Medal|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/british-academy-presidents-medal|website=British Academy|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5014">'''RIVPACS''' (River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System) is an [[aquatic biomonitoring]] system for assessing [[water quality]] in freshwater rivers in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is based on the macroinvertebrate species (such as [[freshwater shrimp]], freshwater [[Freshwater sponge|sponge]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, worms, [[crayfish]], aquatic [[snail]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[freshwater mussel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[insect]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and many others) found at the study site during sampling. Some of these species are tolerant to [[pollution]], low dissolved oxygen, and other stressors, but others are sensitive; organisms vary in their tolerances. Therefore, different species will usually be found, in different proportions, at different river sites of varying quality. Some organisms are especially good [[indicator species]]. The species found at the reference sites collectively make up the species assemblage for that site and are the basis for a statistical comparison between reference sites and non-reference sites. The comparison between the expected species and the observed species can then be used to estimate this aspect of the ecological health of a river. 

The system is meant to be standardized, easy to use, and relatively low cost. It can complement other types of [[water quality]] monitoring such as chemical monitoring. RIVPACS supports the implementation of the [[Water Framework Directive]] as its official tool for macroinvertebrate classification&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/rivpacs-reference-database|title=RIVPACS reference database|last=Feeney|first=Anna|date=2014-12-18|work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference sites can be chosen and adjusted several ways. Usually they represent the best conditions within the region or area under study, and are a short stretch of river. Sometimes the reference site expectations are adjusted for degradation of the entire region by human impact. 'Pristine' [[freshwater]] sites are sampled to collect information on physical characteristics, chemistry, and [[macroinvertebrate]]s, sometimes several times each year&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This information is then used to predict what [[invertebrate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are present from samples of [[physiochemistry]] from other sites. 

RIVPACS is used across the UK and supported by [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]], [[Countryside Council for Wales]], [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], [[Natural England]], [[Environment Agency]], [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]], [[Freshwater Biological Association]], Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research, [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]], [[Scottish Government]], [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], [[South West Water]], and [[Welsh Assembly Government]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This classification of freshwater sites based on the macroinvertebrate [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] was first derived in 1977. Since then it has been developed and updated with addition of a wider range of freshwater sites. It has been adapted into various other versions around the world&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, including a Canadian version known as CABIN&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/rcba-cabin/|title=Canadian aquatic biomonitoring network - CABIN|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=www.ec.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, AUSRIVAS in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ausrivas.ewater.org.au/index.php/introduction|title=AUSRIVAS Australian River Assessment System|last=User|first=Super|website=ausrivas.ewater.org.au|language=en|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, MEDPACS in [[Spain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manuel|first=Poquet, José|last2=Javier|first2=Alba-Tercedor,|last3=Tura|first3=Puntí,|last4=Maria|first4=del Mar Sánchez-Montoya,|last5=Santiago|first5=Robles,|last6=Maruxa|first6=Álvarez,|last7=Carmen|first7=Zamora-Muñoz,|last8=Elisa|first8=Sáinz-Cantero, Carmen|last9=Rosario|first9=Vidal-Abarca, Maria|date=2009|title=MEDiterranean Prediction And Classification System (MEDPACS): an implementation of the RIVPACS/AUSRIVAS predictive approach for assessing Mediterranean aquatic macroinvertebrate communities|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301590232|journal=Hydrobiologia|language=English|issn=0018-8158|doi=10.1007/s10750-008-9655-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Mediterranean Basin|,]] and others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Particular areas of focus include the origins of the Romani people, experiences of [[persecution]] and [[Political repression|political oppression]], the [[Romani language]], [[Romani society and culture]], and Romani customs and traditions. As a formal discipline, Romani studies originated in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1990s, with key contributors including [[Ian Hancock]], Thomas Acton, David Smith, and Michael Stewart.

The area of inquiry of Romani studies often extends beyond ethnic Roma to [[Irish Traveller]]s, [[Yeniche people|Yeniche]], and other groups traditionally known as [[Names of the Romani people#Gypsy|Gypsies]].

==Publications==
The main publication in this field is the [[academic journal]] ''Romani Studies'', which is published by the [[Gypsy Lore Society]] and edited by Kimmo Granqvist, Professor in Romani studies at Södertörn University, Stockholm.

'''Silliness''' is defined as engaging in "a ludicrous [[foolishness|folly]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/silliness |title=silliness - definition of silliness by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing a "lack of good sense or judgment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/silliness |title=Silliness - Synonyms and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the condition of being frivolous, [[Minimisation (psychology)|trivial]], or [[superficiality|superficial]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/silliness |title=Definition of silliness |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In television, film, and the circus, portrayals of silliness such as [[exaggerated]], funny behavior are used to amuse audiences. Portrayals of silliness, provided by clowns and jesters, are also used to lift the spirits of people in hospitals.
==Psychology==
In "The Art of Roughhousing," Anthony DeBenedet and Larry Cohen argue that "wild play" between a child and a parent can foster "joy, love and a deeper connection"; among the actions they suggest is for the parent to be silly and pretend to fall over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-08-17/health/sc-health-0817-child-health-roughhous20110817_1_light-touch-physical-fitness-freeze |title=The benefits of horseplay - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Christianson from New York’s Big Apple Circus "became so interested in the healing qualities of physical comedy that he quit his job"..."to teach [[jester]]s, clowns and [[comedian]]s how to connect with hospital patients through his Clown Care Unit."&lt;ref name="alexthejester1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexthejester.com/html/historyPopup.html |title=Brief History of the Jester |publisher=Alexthejester.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctor named [[Patch Adams]] "...leads a merry band of mirth makers on trips around the world to locations of crisis or suffering in order to serve up some levity and healing."&lt;ref name="alexthejester1"/&gt;


In the US and Mexico, the US practical joke group Improv Everywhere has created an 'international celebration of silliness' by asking commuters to board the New York and Mexico City subways without trousers on a specific day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jan/14/no-pants-subway-day-video |title=No Pants Subway Ride celebrates silliness - video &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2013-01-14|accessdate=2013-07-06 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the circus==

[[File:Clown chili peppers.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|A clown with "happy face" painting]]
In the [[circus]], one of the roles that [[clown]]s play is engaging in silliness. When clowning is taught, the different components of silliness include "funny ways of speaking to make people laugh," making "silly face[s] and sound[s]," engaging in "funny ways of moving, and play[ing] with extreme emotions such as "pretending to laugh and cry." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimdalling.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50:clown-activities-structured-silliness&amp;catid=18:teachers-resources&amp;Itemid=59 |title=Jim Dalling |publisher=Jimdalling.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the [[Northern Arts and Cultural Centre]] held a Children's Festival of Silliness in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naccnt.ca/events/421/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706012355/http://www.naccnt.ca/events/421/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-06 |title=Northern Arts and Cultural Centre: NACC 1st Annual Children's Festival of Silliness! |publisher=Naccnt.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''superconducting tunnel junction''' (STJ) — also known as a '''superconductor–insulator–superconductor tunnel junction''' (SIS) — is an [[electronics|electronic]] device consisting of two [[superconductors]] separated by a very thin layer of [[Insulator (electrical)|insulating]] material. Current passes through the junction via the process of [[quantum tunneling]]. The STJ is a type of [[Josephson junction]], though not all the properties of the STJ are described by the Josephson effect.

These devices have a wide range of applications, including high-sensitivity [[Cryogenic particle detectors|detectors]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[SQUID|magnetometers]], [[RSFQ|high speed digital circuit]] elements, and [[superconducting quantum computing|quantum computing]] circuits.

==Quantum tunneling==
[[File:STJ SVG file.svg|270px|thumb|alt=Illustration of a thin-film superconducting tunnel junction.|Illustration of a thin-film superconducting tunnel junction (STJ). The superconducting material is light blue, the insulating tunnel barrier is black, and the substrate is green.]]
[[File:STJ Energy Diagram.svg|alt=Energy diagram of a superconducting tunnel junction.|thumb|Energy diagram of a superconducting tunnel junction. The vertical axis is energy, and the horizontal axis shows the [[density of states]]. [[Cooper pairs]] exist at the [[Fermi energy]], indicated by the dashed lines. A bias voltage V is applied across the junction, shifting the Fermi energies of the two superconductors relative to each other by an energy eV, where e is the [[electron]] charge. [[Quasiparticle]] states exist for energies greater than Δ from the Fermi energy, where Δ is the superconducting energy gap. Green and blue indicate empty and filled quasiparticle states, respectively, at zero temperature.]]
[[File:STJ IV Curve.jpg|thumb|alt=Sketch of the current-voltage curve of a superconducting tunnel junction.|Sketch of the current-voltage (I-V) curve of a superconducting tunnel junction. The [[Cooper pair]] tunneling current is seen at V = 0, while the [[quasiparticle]] tunneling current is seen for V &gt; 2Δ/e and V &lt; -2Δ/e.]] 
All [[Electrical current|currents]] flowing through the STJ pass through the insulating layer via the process of [[quantum tunneling]].  There are two components to the tunneling current. The first is from the tunneling of [[Cooper pairs]]. This supercurrent is described by the ac and dc [[Josephson effect|Josephson relations]], first predicted by [[Brian David Josephson]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;B. D. Josephson, "Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling," ''Physics Letters'' '''1''', 251 (1962), {{doi|10.1016/0031-9163(62)91369-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this prediction, Josephson received the [[Nobel prize in physics]] in 1973. The second is the [[quasiparticle]] current, which, in the limit of zero temperature, arises when the energy from the bias voltage &lt;math&gt;eV&lt;/math&gt; exceeds twice the value of superconducting energy gap Δ. At finite temperature, a small quasiparticle tunneling current — called the subgap current — is present even for voltages less than twice the energy gap due to the thermal promotion of quasiparticles above the gap.

If the STJ is irradiated with [[photons]] of frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the dc current-voltage curve will exhibit both Shapiro steps and steps due to photon-assisted tunneling. Shapiro steps arise from the response of the supercurrent and occur at voltages equal to &lt;math&gt;nhf/(2e)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]], &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron]] charge, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an [[integer]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Shapiro, "Josephson currents in superconducting tunneling: The effect of microwaves and other observations" ''Physical Review Letters'' '''11''', 80 (1963), {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.11.80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photon-assisted tunneling arises from the response of the quasiparticles and gives rise to steps displaced in voltage by &lt;math&gt;nhf/e&lt;/math&gt; relative to the gap voltage.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tinkham, ''Introduction to Superconductivity'', 2nd edition, Dover Publications, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Device fabrication ==
The device is typically [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] by first depositing a thin film of a superconducting metal such as [[aluminum]] on an insulating substrate such as [[silicon]]. The deposition is performed inside a [[vacuum chamber]]. [[Oxygen]] gas is then introduced into the chamber, resulting in the formation of an insulating layer of [[aluminum oxide]] (&lt;math&gt;Al_{2}O_{3}&lt;/math&gt;) with a typical thickness of several [[nanometers]]. After the vacuum is restored, an overlapping layer of superconducting metal is deposited, completing the STJ. To create a well-defined overlap region, a procedure known as the [[Niemeyer-Dolan technique]] is commonly used. This technique uses a suspended bridge of [[Resist (semiconductor fabrication)|resist]] with a double-angle deposition to define the junction.

[[Aluminum]] is widely used for making superconducting tunnel junctions because of its unique ability to form a very thin (2-3&amp;nbsp;nm) insulating [[Aluminum oxide|oxide]] layer with no defects that [[short-circuit]] the insulating layer. The [[superconducting]] critical temperature of aluminum is approximately 1.2 [[kelvin]] (K). For many applications, it is convenient to have a device that is superconducting at a higher temperature, in particular at a temperature above the [[boiling point]] of [[liquid helium]], which is 4.2 K at atmospheric pressure. One approach to achieving this is to use [[niobium]], which has a superconducting critical temperature in bulk form of 9.3 K. Niobium, however, does not form an oxide that is suitable for making tunnel junctions. To form an insulating oxide, the first layer of niobium can be coated with a very thin layer (approximately 5&amp;nbsp;nm) of aluminum, which is then oxidized to form a high quality aluminum oxide tunnel barrier before the final layer of niobium is deposited. The thin aluminum layer is [[Proximity effect (superconductivity)|proximitized]] by the thicker niobium, and the resulting device has a superconducting critical temperature above 4.2 K.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Joseph,  J. Sese, J. Flokstra, &amp; H. G. Kerkhoff, "Structural testing of the HYPRES niobium process," ''IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity'', '''15''', 106 (2005), {{doi|10.1109/TASC.2005.849705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early work used [[lead]]-lead oxide-lead tunnel junctions.&lt;ref&gt;G. J. Dolan, T. G. Phillips, and D. P. Woody, "Low‐noise 115‐GHz mixing in superconducting oxide‐barrier tunnel junctions," ''Applied Physics Letters'' '''34''', 347 (1979), {{doi|10.1063/1.90783}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lead]] has a superconducting critical temperature of 7.2 K in bulk form, but lead oxide tends to develop defects (sometimes called pinhole defects) that short-circuit the tunnel barrier when the device is thermally cycled between [[cryogenic]] temperatures and room temperature, and as result lead is no longer widely used to make STJs.

==Applications==

===Radio astronomy===
STJs are the most sensitive [[heterodyne]] receivers in the 100&amp;nbsp;GHz to 1000&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency range, and hence are used for [[radio astronomy]] at these frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;J. Zmuidzinas and P. L. Richards, "Superconducting detectors and mixers for millimeter and submillimeter astrophysics," ''Proceedings of the IEEE'' '''92''', 1597 (2004), {{doi|10.1109/JPROC.2004.833670}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this application, the STJ is [[DC bias|dc biased]] at a voltage just below the gap voltage (|V| = 2Δ/e). A high frequency signal from an astronomical object of interest is focused onto the STJ, along with a [[local oscillator]] source. Photons absorbed by the STJ allow quasiparticles to tunnel via the process of photon-assisted tunneling. This photon-assisted tunneling changes the current-voltage curve, creating a nonlinearity that produces an output at the difference frequency of the astronomical signal and the local oscillator. This output is a frequency down-converted version of the astronomical signal.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Wengler, "Submillimeter-wave detection with superconducting tunnel diodes," ''Proceedings of the IEEE'' '''80''', 1810 (1992), {{doi|10.1109/5.175257}}&lt;/ref&gt; These receivers are so sensitive that an accurate description of the device performance must take into account the effects of [[quantum noise]].&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Tucker, "Quantum limited detection in tunnel junction mixers," ''IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics'' '''15''', 1234 (1979), {{doi|10.1109/JQE.1979.1069931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single-photon detection===
In addition to [[heterodyne]] detection, STJs can also be used as direct detectors. In this application, the STJ is biased with a dc voltage less than the gap voltage. A [[photon]] absorbed in the superconductor breaks [[Cooper pairs]] and creates [[quasiparticles]]. The quasiparticles tunnel across the junction in the direction of the applied voltage, and the resulting tunneling current is proportional to the photon energy. STJ devices have been employed as single-photon detectors for photon frequencies ranging from [[X-rays]] to the [[infrared]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=33525 STJ detectors from the European Space Agency], accessed 8-17-11&lt;/ref&gt;

===SQUIDs===
The [[superconducting quantum interference device]] or [[SQUID]] is based on a superconducting loop containing Josephson junctions. SQUIDs are the world's most sensitive [[magnetometer]]s, capable of measuring a single [[magnetic flux quantum]].

===Quantum computing===
[[Superconducting quantum computing]] utilizes STJ-based circuits, including [[charge qubit]]s, [[flux qubit]]s and [[phase qubit]]s.

===RSFQ===
The STJ is the primary active element in [[rapid single flux quantum]] or [[RSFQ]] fast logic circuits.&lt;ref&gt;K. K. Likharev and V. K. Semenov, "RSFQ logic/memory family: a new Josephson-junction technology for sub-terahertz-clock-frequency digital systems," ''IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity'' '''1''', 3 (1991) {{doi|10.1109/77.80745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Josephson voltage standard===
When a high frequency current is applied to a Josephson junction, the ac Josephson current will synchronize with the applied frequency giving rise to regions of constant voltage in the I-V curve of the device (Shapiro steps).  For the purpose of voltage standards, these steps occur at the voltages &lt;math&gt; nf/K_{J} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is an integer, &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is the applied frequency and the Josephson constant 
&lt;math&gt; K_{J} = 483597.9 \,\textrm{GHz}/\textrm{V} &lt;/math&gt; is an internationally defined constant essentially equal to &lt;math&gt; 2e/h &lt;/math&gt;.  These steps provide an exact conversion from frequency to voltage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5626">The '''sustainable yield''' of [[natural capital]] is the [[ecological yield]] that can be extracted without reducing the base of capital itself, i.e. the surplus required to maintain [[ecosystem services]] at the same or increasing level over time.  This yield usually varies over time with the needs of the [[ecosystem]] to maintain itself, e.g. a [[forest]] that has recently suffered a [[blight]] or [[flooding]] or [[fire]] will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain and re-establish a mature forest.  While doing so, the sustainable yield may be much less.

In fisheries, the basic natural capital, or virgin population, must decrease with extraction. At the same time productivity increases. Hence, sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield. It may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield, because dynamic ecological conditions and other factors  not  related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both the natural capital and its productivity.

==Maximum sustainable yield==
{{see also|Maximum sustainable yield}}
In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''maximum sustainable yield''' or '''MSY''' is, theoretically, the largest yield/catch that can be taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period. Under the assumption of logistic growth, the MSY will be exactly at half the [[carrying capacity]] of a species, as this is the stage at when population growth is highest. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the [[optimum sustainable yield]].

This [[logistic function|logistic]] model of growth is produced by a population introduced to a new habitat or with very poor numbers going through a lag phase of slow growth at first. Once it reaches a foothold population it will go through a rapid growth rate that will start to level off once the species approaches carrying capacity. The idea of maximum sustained yield is to decrease population density to the point of highest growth rate possible. This changes the number of the population, but the new number can be maintained indefinitely, ideally.

In most fisheries, the population has been decreased so significantly from their native populations, that the only way to increase production is to decrease production, and wait for populations to recover. Establishing limits is a perennial difficulty.

MSY is extensively used for fisheries management. Unlike [[Milner Baily Schaefer#Schaefer short-term catch equation|Schaefer's logistic model]], MSY in most modern fisheries models occurs at around 30% of the unexploited population size. This fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method.

Unfortunately errors in estimating the population dynamics of a species can lead to setting the maximum sustainable yield too high (or too low). An example of this was the New Zealand [[orange roughy]] fishery. Early quotas were based on an assumption that the orange roughy had a fairly short lifespan and bred relatively quickly. However, it was later discovered that the orange roughy lived a long time and had [[k-selection|bred slowly]] (~30 years). By this stage stocks had been largely depleted.

==Optimum sustainable yield==
{{see also|Optimum sustainable yield}}
In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the [[Level of Effort|level of effort]] (LOE) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being utilized. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of maximum sustainable yield.

In [[environmental science]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield.

==Annual Sustainable Yield==
Annual Sustainable Yield (ASY) is defined as biomass that can be harvested from a fish population each year without resulting in a decline.  ASY is dynamic and is adjusted based on population levels and performance of previous years fisheries.

The '''Swiss Nanoscience Institute''' (SNI) at the University of Basel is a center of excellence for nanosciences and nanotechnology. In the SNI network, interdisciplinary teams of scientists conduct basic and applied research and actively support knowledge and technology transfer to industry. Within the study of nanoscience and the PhD School, the SNI trains young scientists and prepares them for careers in industry and academia.

The SNI was founded in 2006 by the Canton of Aargau and the University of Basel to promote research and training in the nanosciences and nanotechnology in Northwestern Switzerland. Since then, numerous research projects have been successfully initiated in which researchers from various disciplines and institutions work together in one network. In addition to research and training, the SNI is also involved in public relations and provides targeted support for various initiatives, particularly those aiming to interest children and young people in the natural sciences.

== SNI network ==

The success of the SNI is based on the interdisciplinary network that has been built up and consolidated over the years. This network includes various departments at the University of Basel, the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW), the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), the Department for Biosystems Science and Engineering at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich in Basel (D-BSSE) and the CSEM (Centre Suisse d’Electronique et de Microtechnique) in Muttenz. Membership of the SNI, which is earned by participating in SNI projects, and regular academic conferences involving its members constantly stimulate and encourage the exchange of information within the network.

== Bachelor and Master Program ==

In 2002, the University of Basel – under the leadership of the SNI’s predecessor institution – launched the Bachelor’s and master's degree programs in nanosciences. Today, this demanding degree program is firmly established. Around 40 students who begin the Bachelor’s program each year receive a solid basic education in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics and can subsequently choose from a wide range of courses that allow the students to focus on specific topics. Early on in their education, they have the opportunity to participate in various research groups, an activity that always proves particularly motivating.

== PhD School ==
 
To promote the further training of young scientists and a wide spectrum of basic scientific research, the SNI initiated a PhD School in 2013. At the end of 2014, 24 doctoral students were enrolled. Within the SNI PhD School, each doctoral student is supervised by two members of the SNI network. They also become involved in internal events such as the Winter School and the Annual Meeting and take part in various courses to gain insights into areas such as intellectual property, communication and rhetoric.

== Leaders in their field ==
 
Basic sciences form the foundation of research work at the SNI. In addition to the various projects funded as part of the PhD School, the SNI also supports the basic scientific research performed by Argovia professors Roderick Lim and Martino Poggio. Both were promoted to associate professor in 2014 and their research successes in nanobiology and nanotechnology have contributed to the SNI’s outstanding international reputation. The SNI also supports titular professors Frithjof Nolting and Thomas Jung, who work in the Department of Physics at the University of Basel and at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), and, from the end of 2014, Michel Kenzelmann who also works for the PSI and the Department of Physics.

== Practical application ==

Since it was founded, the SNI has placed great value on the transfer of academic findings to industry. To optimize this process, the SNI started an annual call for applied research projects. This program entitled Nano Argovia supports about ten projects each year from broad ranging areas of nanotechnology in close collaboration with industrial companies in Northwestern Switzerland and has a total budget of around 1.5 million Swiss francs. With the Nano Argovia program, the SNI is building an important bridge between research and application. In several cases, this collaboration has led to Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) and other follow-on projects.

== Services ==

The SNI views itself not only as a pure research institution, but also provides various services to industrial companies. In excellently equipped workshops for technology, electronics and mechanics, internal groups and industrial companies can harness the in-depth knowledge of the staff and the outstanding technical resources of the SNI and the affiliated departments.

== Sharing the fascination with others ==

The SNI wishes to involve the public in its fascination with the natural sciences through active communication and participation in various events. For example, the SNI team is actively involved in science festivals and fairs both at home and abroad, provides schools and groups of interested visitors with an insight into everyday laboratory life, and strives to make scientific achievement

The '''Temple for Peace''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Temple pour la Paix'') is a construction project of the congregation [[Vajradhara-Ling]] in [[Normandy]] to promote [[world peace]]. The cornerstone was laid in 2003 and construction started in 2010. This [[Temple]] will be built in the same style as the [[Samye]] monastery, the first temple built in [[Tibet]] that was founded by [[Padmasambhava]] in the 8th century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705110245/http://www.kagyu-dzong.com/site/projets/projet.htm Les projets de Lama Gyourmé pour Vajradhara-Ling]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims of the Temple ==
The aims of the Temple for Peace is not only to share teachings of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] but also to welcome demonstrations linked to peace: symposia, [[Interfaith|inter-religious meetings]], expositions and performances. It will be a place to encounter and favor the exchanges between different schools of [[Buddhism]], as well as [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Islam|Moslem]], [[Judaism|Jews]], and other traditions such as those of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians of North America]] and [[Indigenous Australians]].  Meetings will be organized between wise representatives of these traditions, enabling a better knowledge of their diversity as well as common values: their contributions in building a better world, mutual tolerance and the respect of others, in particular through peace and [[non-violence]]. Conferences will gather recognized personalities working to promote peace such as [[List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates|Nobel Peace Prize laureates]], women and men involved in [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] projects, religious dignitaries of different confessions, artists working to promote respect and tolerance between peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agoravox.fr/culture-loisirs/culture/article/festival-paix-et-lumiere-a-la-77458 Festival Paix et Lumière à la Pagode de Vincennes 26 et 27 juin 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genesis of the project ==
In 1995 and in 1998, [[Lama Gyurme]] visited [[Tibet]] in a pilgrimage and met [[Orgyen Trinley Dorje]], the 17th [[Karmapa]] at [[Tsurphu]]. He presented him his project for construction of a temple for peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vajradharaling.org/p_tp-descriptif3.php Genèse du projet "Temple pour la Paix"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907094829/http://vajradharaling.org/p_tp-descriptif3.php |date=2008-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The authorization to construct the Temple was granted by the French authorities in March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.templepourlapaix.org/pages/index.php?langage=1&amp;idRubrique=2&amp;idCategorie=2 Historique du projet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928183846/http://www.templepourlapaix.org/pages/index.php?langage=1&amp;idRubrique=2&amp;idCategorie=2 |date=2009-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cornerstone]] was laid by [[Tenga Rinpoche]] on September 21, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceandesagesse.org/doc/dossier_presse_FR.pdf Dalaï Lama France 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727140515/http://www.oceandesagesse.org/doc/dossier_presse_FR.pdf |date=2011-07-27 }}, see page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was consecrated by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] on August 14, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vajradharaling.org/_download/presse/dossiers/VDL_SSDL-2008.pdf Venue de sa sainteté le dalaï-lama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206054118/http://www.vajradharaling.org/_download/presse/dossiers/VDL_SSDL-2008.pdf |date=2008-12-06 }}, site de [[Vajradhara-Ling]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ouest-france.fr/actu/actuDet_-Lama-Gyourme-a-recu-le-Dalai-lama-a-Aubry-le-Panthou-_8618-785432_actu.Htm Lama Gyourmé a reçu le Dalaï-lama à Aubry-le-Panthou], Ouest-France, December 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; at this occasion, the Dalai Lama delivered a speech on peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20min.ch/ro/news/monde/story/22641770 Le dalaï lama devrait attirer les foules en France], Associated Press, August 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Critical Legal Studies Movement''''' is a book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. First published in 1983 as an article in the ''Harvard Law Review'', published in book form in 1986, and reissued with a new introduction in 2015, ''The Critical Legal Studies Movement'' is a principal document of the American [[Critical legal studies|critical legal studies movement]] that supplied the book with its title. In the book, Unger argues that law and legal thought offers unrealized possibilities for the self-construction of a more democratic society, and that many lawyers and legal theorists have uncritically surrendered to constraints that undermine their ability to make use of law’s transformative potential. Unger explains how the critical legal studies movement has refined and reformulated the major themes of leftist and progressive legal theorists, namely the critique of formalism and objectivism in legal doctrine, and the purely instrumental use of legal practice and doctrine to advance leftist aims, and in doing so, has identified elements of a constructive program for the reconstruction of society.

==Overview==

Unger sets out to show how contemporary theories of law and society have been constrained by the false belief that law is a necessary expression of certain abstract ideas of social organization, such as democracy or market economy.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=83-86}} Unger contends that these modes of social organization do not have any natural, necessary, or inevitable form.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=103}} Unger begins ''The Critical Legal Studies Movement'' by critiquing formalism and objectivism, the ideas that he believes lie at the root of the necessitarian thinking that blinds us to law's transformative and constructive potential and possibilities.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=83-93}} Formalism is the belief that lawmaking differs fundamentally from law application.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=79-80}} Objectivism is the belief that authoritative legal materials (statues, cases, accepted legal ideas) embody and sustain a defensible scheme of human association and display an intelligible moral order.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=80-81}}

===Chapter 1: The Criticism of Legal Thought===

Unger suggests that applying "extreme criticism" to formalist and objectivist ideas will expose the elements of a constructive program for the reconstruction of society in line with leftist aims.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=83}} In this chapter he sets forth critiques of objectivism and formalism. His critique of objectivism aims to show that there is no built-in legal structure for a social organization, and that democracy and the market do not have a universal legal language.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=83-86}} His attack on formalism shows that existing legal theories claim to achieve "sanctification of the actual"—that is, these theories claim that substantive law and doctrine just happens to coincide with a coherent normative theory about human conduct.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=86-90}} Unger explains that such legal analysis is, in reality, pieced together by an endless process of ad hoc adjustments.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=89}}

Unger explains that the turning point for many critical legal theorists was when they decided to pursue the critical attack on formalism and objectivism to the hilt, at grave risk of "confusion, paralysis, and marginality."{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=93}}

===Chapter 2: From Critique to Construction===

In this chapter, Unger sets forth the constructive outcome of the critiques of formalism and objectivism, namely the practice of "deviationist doctrine" (also called "expanded doctrine"), and the search for alternative institutional forms for basic social institutions, particularly the market and democracy.

Deviationist doctrine, according to Unger, represents an attempt to bridge doctrine with empirical social theory and ideological conflict.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=96}} Such an expanded form of doctrine fights over the terms of social life, and refuses to accept that established forms of society reflect any practical or psychological necessities.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=103}} Everything is up for grabs. Such doctrine aims to point out how biased, power-ridden and makeshift legal materials have gained a semblance of necessity that they should not be granted.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=99}} In brief, deviationist doctrine encourages theorists to transform society by taking an ideal from one part of social life, and extending it into an area from which it had previously been excluded.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=99-100}} This has the advantage of allowing the theorist to draw upon a rich collective history of ideas and institutions that have helped to articulate the ideal in the past, and can now be marshaled to defend its extension into a new area of social life.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=100}}

The search for alternative forms of basic social organization aims to shape social institutions to be more hospitable and nurturing to the context-transcending nature of human beings.  Unger characterizes this search as "the quest for a social world that can better do justice to a being whose most remarkable quality is precisely the power to overcome and revise, with time, every social or mental structure in which he moves."{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=105}} Unger sees this effort as defensible because it pushes the preconceptions of liberal legal and political theory to their natural conclusions.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=106-107}}

Unger sketches the various features that the institutional program he proposes should have:
* The program would transform relations between people, a transformation of social life that has been prefigured in the literary and philosophical achievements of 20th century modernism. Under this program, personal relationships would be liberated from the background of social division and hierarchy that has haunted mankind throughout history. Until now, the processes of cultural revolution have been cut off from the struggle over the structure of society.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=107-109}} 
* The program would represent an "empowered democracy." Unger points out how existing democracies do not even satisfy the minimal core of the democratic ideal, and he identifies ways to surmount obstacles to empowered democracy.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=109-113}} 
* Government should be reorganized to restrain the state without paralyzing its transformative capabilities. The devices that restrain the state in contemporary democracies also serve to deadlock the state.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=114-115}}
* The established market system should be destabilized to allow greater access to capital by all, which would disentrench the elites who, by monopolizing privilege, discourage experimentation and hinder economic progress.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=115-119}}  
* New rights should be recognized, rights that would protect the interests of all members of society and ensure their ability to participate fully in the political, economic, and moral life of their society.  These rights would include immunity rights, destabilization rights, market rights, and solidarity rights.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=119-124}} 
* The program could be summed up as expressing a "superliberalism"—making social life resemble, to some extent, what politics are already like in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=124-125}}

===Chapter 3: Two Models of Doctrine===

In this section, Unger proposes the transformation of existing doctrine that would help to advance the aims of the critical legal studies movement. First, he explains how the ambitions underlying equal protection doctrine could better be achieved by expanding this doctrine so that individuals and institutions are vested with "destabilization rights"—that is, the right to disentrench accumulations of power that serve to inhibit and disempower members of society.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=127-143}} Second, he proposes to change the social institutions of contract and property to bring them more in line with principles of solidarity and community.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=143-178}}

===Chapter 4: Underlying Conceptions and Broader Implications===

In this chapter, Unger addresses two plausible objections to the program of critical legal studies, and offers his response to them. The objections are, in turn, that it seems merely an accident that we find ourselves in a situation in which we are engaged in the "internal development" of a program such as the one Unger describes, and thus such a program would seem to have no intrinsic authority, since just as easily we could have found ourselves developing a program that leads in another direction. The second plausible objection is that any tradition is inherently ambiguous, and equally compelling arguments could be made for developing the tradition of leftist movements in some other direction.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=179-180}}

Unger contends that the program he sets forth is one that has the best chance of harnessing the "negative capability" of human beings—that is, teaching the person "to move within contexts with the dignity of a context-transcending agent." Such a world would be one that more fully reconciles the conflict, felt in every person's life, between the need for self-assertion among other people, and the need to be protected from other people.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=181-183}} Furthermore, against the claim that tradition is ambiguous and could be developed in some other direction, Unger argues that his program offers the best chance for making freedom concrete for human beings. Such a program seeks to narrow the gap between our vast transcending capabilities, and the limiting structures in which we live.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=184}}

===Chapter 5: Another Politics===

Unger concludes ''The Critical Legal Studies Movement'' by describing how his program offers the opportunity to fuse the revolution in the sphere of personal relations, with revolution in the uses of government power and institutional structure.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=199-200}} The transformative activity that he urges would take place in several settings: in contributing substantive ideas to the project of a democratic remaking of social life; in the transformation of professional technique in all areas of professional expertise, so that there is less gap between activities that leave social structures unchallenged, and activities that call structures into question, and so that the gap between laymen and professionals begins to wane; and finally, in the setting of law schools, where, by penetrating the specialized study of law, the ideas Unger sets forth have the greatest chance of taking root so that they spread throughout society.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=199-204}}

==Reception==

Reviewing the book for the ''New York Times'', Calvin Woodard described ''The Critical Legal Studies Movement'' as an "ambitious and impressive undertaking. It also defies summation. It is a carefully crafted statement with ideas interlocked like a chain-link fence that stretches as far as the eye can see."{{sfn|Woodard|1986}} The central theme of the movement, Woodard explained, is

&lt;blockquote&gt;to remove the constraints and hindrances imposed on individuals by unjust social hierarchy and class, enabling them to develop a new sense of self and to give full and free expression to their innate intelligence and imagination. To Mr. Unger, liberated individuals endowed with dignity, self-respect and equal opportunity are the highest hope of humankind. Collectively, a society of such people would make up a new form of ''empowered democracy'' in which all social decisions would be regarded as political ones...{{sfn|Woodard|1986}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Woodard gave high praise to ''The Critical Legal Studies Movement'', stating that "[w]hether one agrees with Mr. Unger and C.L.S. or not, one cannot fail to be impressed by his high idealism and intelligence,"  but that "I suspect it will be read mostly by the converted and others will not bother. As a result, a whole generation of older readers will miss out on a book that very probably will have enormous influence on the younger generation of law students."{{sfn|Woodard|1986}}

[[File:IV-V-I in C.png|thumb|[[Perfect authentic cadence]] (IV–V–I [[chord progression]], in which we see the chords F major, G major, and then C major, in four-part harmony) in C major {{audio|IV-V-I in C.mid|Play}}. "Tonal music is built around these tonic and dominant arrival points [cadences], and they form one of the fundamental building blocks of musical structure" {{harv|Benjamin, Horvitz, and Nelson|2008|loc=63}}.]]

'''Tonality''' is the arrangement of [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and/or [[chord (music)|chords]] of a musical work in a hierarchy of perceived relations, stabilities, attractions and directionality. In this hierarchy, the single pitch or [[triad (music)|triadic chord]] with the greatest stability is called the [[tonic (music)|tonic]]. The [[root (music)|root]] of the tonic chord forms the name given to the [[key (music)|key]]; so in the key of C major, the note C is both the tonic of the scale and the root of the tonic chord (which is C–E–G). Simple [[folk music]] songs often start and end with the tonic note. The most common use of the term "is to designate the arrangement of musical phenomena around a referential tonic in [[Classical music|European music]] from about 1600 to about 1910" {{harv|Hyer|2001}}. [[Contemporary classical music]] from 1910 to the 2000s may practice or avoid any sort of tonality—but [[harmony]] in almost all Western [[popular music]] remains tonal.{{Vague|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--There are several; different senses of "tonality" defined in this article (see the "vague" flag on the Tagg quotation in the next paragraph, and the article's caution about context where the quotation is repeated in the body.--&gt; Harmony in [[jazz music|jazz]] includes many but not all tonal characteristics of the European [[Common practice period|common practice]] period, sometimes known as "classical music".

"All harmonic idioms in popular music are tonal, and none is without [[Diatonic function|function]]" {{harv|Tagg|2003|loc=534}}.{{Vague|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--There are eight senses of "tonality" specified in the body of the article, all of which (including the modal practice of pre-modern church music and twelve-tone technique) could potentially fulfill this description. To which of these does Tagg refer?--&gt;
Tonality is an organized system of tones (e.g., the tones of a major or minor scale) in which one tone (the tonic) becomes the central point for the remaining tones. The other tones in a tonal piece are all defined in terms of their relationship to the tonic. In tonality, the tonic (tonal center) is the tone of complete relaxation and stability, the target toward which other tones lead {{harv|Benward &amp; Saker|2003|loc=36}}. The [[cadence (music)|cadence]] (coming to rest point) in which the [[dominant chord]] or [[dominant seventh]] chord resolves to the tonic chord plays an important role in establishing the tonality of a piece. "Tonal music is music that is ''unified'' and ''dimensional''. Music is unified if it is exhaustively referable to a precompositional system generated by a single constructive principle derived from a basic scale-type; it is dimensional if it can nonetheless be distinguished from that precompositional ordering" {{harv|Pitt|1995|loc=299}}.

The term ''tonalité'' originated with [[Alexandre-Étienne Choron|Alexandre-Étienne]] {{harvtxt|Choron|1810}} and was borrowed by [[François-Joseph Fétis]] in 1840 ({{harvnb|Reti|1958|loc={{Page needed|date=May 2009}}}}; {{harvnb|Simms|1975|loc=119}}; {{harvnb|Judd|1998a|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Heyer|2001}}; {{harvnb|Brown|2005|loc=xiii}}). According to [[Carl Dahlhaus]], however, the term ''tonalité'' was only coined by [[Castil-Blaze]] in 1821 ({{harvnb|Dahlhaus|1967|loc=960}}; {{harvnb|Dahlhaus|1980|loc=51}}). Although Fétis used it as a general term for a system of musical organization and spoke of ''types de tonalités'' rather than a single system, today the term is most often used to refer to [[Major and minor|major–minor]] tonality, the system of musical organization of the common practice period. Major-minor tonality is also called ''harmonic tonality'' (in the title of Carl {{harvnb|Dahlhaus|1990}}, translating the German ''harmonische Tonalität''), ''diatonic tonality'', ''common practice tonality'', ''functional tonality'', or just ''tonality''.

== Characteristics and features ==
At least eight distinct senses of the word "tonality" (and corresponding adjective, "tonal"), some mutually exclusive, have been identified {{harv|Hyer|2001}}: {{vague|date=March 2015|reason=Who identified these senses? Where did they find them used?}}

=== Systematic organization ===
First, the word tonality may describe any systematic organization of pitch phenomena in any music at all, including pre-17th century western music as well as much non-western music, such as music based on the [[slendro]] and [[pelog]] pitch collections of Indonesian [[gamelan]], or employing the modal nuclei of the [[Arabic maqam]] or the Indian [[raga]] system.

This sense also applies to the tonic/dominant/subdominant harmonic harmonic constellations in the theories of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] as well as the 144 basic transformations of [[twelve-tone technique]]. By the middle of the 20th century, it had become "evident that triadic structure does not necessarily generate a tone center, that non-triadic harmonic formations may be made to function as referential elements, and that the assumption of a twelve-tone complex does not preclude the existence of tone centers".{{harv|Perle|1991|loc=8}}

For the composer and theorist [[George Perle]], tonality is not "a matter of 'tone-centeredness', whether based on a 'natural' hierarchy of pitches derived from the overtone series or an 'artificial' pre compositional ordering of the pitch material; nor is it essentially connected to the kinds of pitch structures one finds in traditional diatonic music" {{harv|Pitt|1995|loc=291}}. This sense (like some of the others) is susceptible to ideological employment, as Schoenberg, did by relying on the idea of a progressive development in musical resources "to compress divergent ''fin-de-siècle'' compositional practices into a single historical lineage in which his own music brings one historical era to a close and begins the next." From this point of view, twelve-tone music could  be regarded "either as the natural and inevitable culmination of an organic motivic process ([[Anton Webern|Webern]]) or as a historical ''Aufhebung'' ([[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]]), the dialectical synthesis of late Romantic motivic practice on the one hand with a musical sublimation of tonality as pure system on the other" {{harv|Hyer|2001}}.

=== Theoretical arrangement of pitches ===
In another sense, tonality means any rational and self-contained [[Music theory|theoretical arrangement]] of musical pitches, existing prior to any concrete embodiment in music.

For example, "Sainsbury, who had Choron translated into English in 1825, rendered the first occurrence of tonalité as a 'system of modes' before matching it with the neologism 'tonality'. While tonality qua system constitutes a theoretical (and thus imaginative) abstraction from actual music, it is often hypostatized in musicological discourse, converted from a theoretical structure into a musical reality. In this sense, it is understood as a Platonic form or prediscursive musical essence that suffuses music with intelligible sense, which exists before its concrete embodiment in music, and can thus be theorized and discussed apart from actual musical contexts" {{harv|Hyer|2001}}.

=== Contrast with modal and atonal systems ===
A third sense is a term to contrast with "[[Mode (music)|modal]]" and "[[Atonality|atonal]]", the term tonality is used to imply that tonal music is discontinuous as a form of cultural expression from modal music (before 1600) on the one hand and atonal music (after 1910) on the other.

=== Pre-modern concept ===
In some literature, a fourth sense of tonality is a generic term applied to pre-modern music, referring to the eight modes of the Western church, implying that important historical continuities underlie music before and after the emergence of [[musical modernism]] around 1600, with the difference between ''tonalité ancienne'' (before 1600) and ''tonalité moderne'' (after 1600) being one of emphasis rather than of kind.

=== Referential tonic ===
Fifth, in a general way, tonality can refer to a wide variety of musical phenomena (harmonies, cadential formulae, harmonic progressions, melodic gestures, formal categories) as arranged or understood in relation to a referential tonic.

=== Tonal theories ===
In a sixth, slightly different sense to the one above, tonality can also be used to refer to musical phenomena perceived or preinterpreted in terms of the categories of tonal theories.

This is a psychophysical sense, where for example "listeners tend to hear a given pitch as, for instance, an&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; A above middle C, an augmented 4th above E{{Music|flat}}, the minor 3rd in an F{{Music|sharp}} minor triad, a dominant in relation to D, or {{music|scale|2}} (where the caret designates a scale degree) in G major rather than a mere acoustical frequency, in this case 440 Hz" {{harv|Hyer|2001}}.

=== Synonym for "key" ===
Seventh, the word tonality has more recently been used by amateur musicians and in [[popular music]] as a synonym for "[[key (music)|key]]"—in this sense meaning "keyness"

This is the most common usage, referring to the arrangement of musical phenomena around a referential tonic, as found in European music from about 1600 to about 1910, using two modal genera, [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]]

=== Other perspectives ===
Eighth, there is a loose assortment of ideas associated with the term.

"Tonal harmonies must always include the third of the chord" {{harv|Brown|2005|loc=46}}.

In major and minor harmonies, the [[perfect fifth]] is often implied and understood by the listener even if it is not present. To function as a tonic, a chord must be either a major or a minor triad. Dominant function requires a major-quality triad with a root a perfect fifth above the affiliated tonic and containing the leading tone of the key. This dominant triad must be preceded by a chord progression that establishes the dominant as the penultimate goal of a motion that is completed by moving on to the tonic. In this final dominant-to-tonic progression, the leading tone normally ascends by semitone motion to the tonic scale degree ({{harvnb|Berry|1976|loc=54}}; {{harvnb|Brown|2005|loc=4}}; {{harvnb|Burnett and Nitzberg|2007|loc=97}}; {{harvnb|Rogers|2004|loc=47}}). A dominant seventh chord always consist of a major triad with an added minor seventh above the root. To achieve this in minor keys, the seventh scale degree must be raised to create a major triad on the dominant ({{harvnb|Duckworth|2015|loc=225}}; {{harvnb|Mayfield|2013|loc=94}}).

[[David Cope|David]] {{harvtxt|Cope|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=May 2009}}}} considers key, [[consonance and dissonance]] (relaxation and tension, respectively), and hierarchical relationships the three most basic concepts in tonality.

Carl Dahlhaus {{harv|Dahlhaus|1990|loc=102}} lists the characteristic schemata of tonal harmony, "typified in the compositional formulas of the 16th and early 17th centuries," as the "complete cadence" I–[[ii–V–I]], [[I–IV–V–I]], I–IV–I–V–I; the [[circle of fifths]] progression I–IV–vii°–iii–[[vi–ii–V–I]]; and the major–minor parallelism: minor v–i–VII–III equals major iii–vi–V–I; or minor III–VII–i–v equals major I–V–vi–iii. The last of these progressions is characterized by "retrograde" harmonic motion.

=== Form ===
{{Main|Musical form}}

=== Consonance and dissonance ===
{{Main|Consonance and dissonance}}
The consonance and dissonance of different intervals plays an important role in establishing the tonality of a piece or section in [[common practice music]] and [[popular music]]. For example, for a simple [[folk music]] song in the key of C Major, almost all of the triadic chords in the song will be Major or minor chords which are stable and consonant (e.g., in the key of C Major, commonly-used chords will included D minor, F Major, G Major, etc.). The most commonly used dissonant chord in a pop song context is the [[dominant seventh]] chord built on the fifth scale degree; in the key of C Major, this would be a G dominant seventh chord, or G7 chord, which contains the pitches G, B, D and F. This dominant seventh chord contains a dissonant [[tritone]] interval between the notes B and F. In pop music, the listener will expect this tritone to be resolved to a consonant, stable chord (in this case, typically a C Major [[cadence (music)|cadence]] (coming to rest point) or a [[deceptive cadence]] to an A minor chord).

=== Tonal musics ===
"The larger portion of the world's folk and art music can be categorized as tonal," as long as the definition is as follows: "Tonal music gives priority to a single tone or tonic. In this kind of music all the constituent tones and resulting tonal relationships are heard and identified relative to their tonic" {{harv|Susanni|2012|loc=66}}. In this sense, "All harmonic idioms in popular music are tonal, and none is without function" {{harv|Tagg|2003|loc=534}}. However, "within the continuing hegemony of tonality there is evidence for a relatively separate tradition of genuine folk musics, which do not operate completely or even mainly according to the assumptions or rules of tonality. … throughout the reign of tonality there seem to have existed subterranean folk musical traditions organized on principles different from tonality, and often modal: Celtic songs and blues are obvious examples" {{harv|Shepherd, Virden, Vulliamy, and Wishart|1977|loc=156}}.

According to Allan {{harvtxt|Moore|1995|loc=191}}, "part of the heritage of rock lies within common-practice tonality" {{harv|Burns|2000|loc=213}} but, because the [[leading-tone|leading-note]]/tonic relationship is "axiomatic to the definition of common-practice tonality", and a fundamental feature of rock music's identity is the absence of a diatonic leading tone, the harmonic practices of rock music, "while sharing many features with classical tonality, are nonetheless distinct" {{harv|Moore|1995|loc=187}}. Power chords are especially problematic when trying to apply classical functional tonality to certain varieties of popular music. Genres such as [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[punk rock]], and [[grunge music]] "took power chords into new arenas, often with a reduced emphasis on tonal function. These genres are often expressed in two parts—a bass line doubled in fifths, and a single vocal part. Power chord technique was often allied with modal procedure" {{harv|Everett|2000|loc= 331}}.

Much jazz is tonal, but "functional tonality in jazz has different properties than that of common-practice classical music. These properties are represented by a unique set of rules dictating the unfolding of harmonic function, voice-leading conventions, and the overall behavior of chord tones and chordal extensions" {{harv|Terefenko|2014|loc=26}}.

== History and theory ==
=== 18th century ===
[[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''Treatise on Harmony'' (1722) is the earliest effort to explain tonal harmony through a coherent system based on acoustical principles {{harv|Girdlestone|1969|loc=520}}, built upon the functional unit being the [[triad (music)|triad]], with inversions.

=== 19th century ===
The term "tonalité" (tonality) was first used in 1810 by Alexandre Choron in the preface "Sommaire de l'histoire de la musique" {{harv|Brown|2005|loc=xiii}} to the "Dictionnaire historique des musiciens artistes et amateurs" (which he published in collaboration with [[:fr:François-Joseph-Marie Fayolle|François-Joseph-Marie Fayolle]]) to describe the arrangement of the dominant and subdominant above and below the tonic—a constellation that had been made familiar by Rameau. According to Choron, this pattern, which he called ''tonalité moderne'', distinguished modern music's harmonic organization from that of earlier [pre 17th century] music, including "tonalité des Grecs" (ancient Greek modes) and "tonalité ecclésiastique" (plainchant) ({{harvnb|Choron|1810|loc=xxxvii–xl}}; {{harvnb|Hyer|2001}}). According to Choron, the beginnings of this modern tonality are found in the music of [[Claudio Monteverdi]] around the year 1595, but it was more than a century later that the full application of tonal harmony finally supplanted the older reliance on the melodic orientation of the church modes, in the music of the [[Neapolitan School]]—most especially that of [[Francesco Durante]] {{harv|Choron|1810|loc=xxxviii, xl}}.

François-Joseph Fétis developed the concept of ''tonalité'' in the 1830s and 1840s {{harv|Brown|2005|loc=xiii}}, finally codifying his theory of tonality in 1844, in his ''Traité complet de la théorie et de la pratique de l'harmonie'' ({{harvnb|Hyer|2001}}; {{harvnb|Wangermée and Ellis|2001}}). Fétis saw ''tonalité moderne'' as the historically evolving phenomenon with three stages: tonality of ''ordre transitonique'' ("transitonic order"), of ''ordre pluritonique'' ("pluritonic order") and, finally, ''ordre omnitonique'' ("omnitonic order"). The "transitonic" phase of tonality he connected with the late [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]. He described his earliest example of ''tonalité moderne'' thus: "In the passage quoted here from Monteverdi's madrigal (''Cruda amarilli'', mm. 9–19 and 24–30), one sees a tonality determined by the ''accord parfait'' [root position major chord] on the tonic, by the sixth chord assigned to the chords on the third and seventh degrees of the scale, by the optional choice of the ''accord parfait'' or the sixth chord on the sixth degree, and finally, by the ''accord parfait'' and, above all, by the unprepared seventh chord (with major third) on the dominant" {{harv|Fétis|1844|loc=171}}. Among most subtle representatives of "pluritonic order" there were Mozart and Rossini; this stage he saw as the culmination and perfection of ''tonalité moderne''. The romantic tonality of Berlioz and especially Wagner he related to "omnitonic order" with its "insatiable desire for modulation" {{harv|Hyer|2002|loc=748}}. His prophetic vision of the omnitonic order (though he didn't approve it personally) as the way of further development of tonality was a remarkable innovation to historic and theoretic concepts of the 19th century {{harv|Simms|1975|loc=132}}.

''Tonalité ancienne'' Fetis described as tonality of ''ordre unitonique'' (establishing one key and remaining in that key for the duration of the piece). The principal example of this "unitonic order" tonality he saw in the Western plainchant.

Fétis believed that tonality, ''tonalité moderne'', was entirely cultural, saying, "For the elements of music, nature provides nothing but a multitude of tones differing in pitch, duration, and intensity by the greater or least degree&amp;nbsp;... The conception of the relationships that exist among them is awakened in the intellect, and, by the action of sensitivity on the one hand, and will on the other, the mind coordinates the tones into different series, each of which corresponds to a particular class of emotions, sentiments, and ideas. Hence these series become various types of tonalities."{{harv|Fétis|1844|loc=11–12}} "But one will say, 'What is the principle behind these scales, and what, if not acoustic phenomena and the laws of mathematics, has set the order of their tones?' I respond that this principle is purely metaphysical [anthropological]. We conceive this order and the melodic and harmonic phenomena that spring from it out of our conformation and education."{{harv|Fétis|1844|loc=249}}

Fétis' "Traité complet" was very popular. In France alone the book was printed between 1844 and 1903 twenty times. The 1st edition was printed in Paris and Brussels in 1844, the 9th edition was printed in [https://archive.org/details/traitcompletde00ft Paris in 1864], and the 20th edition was printed in Paris in 1903. For more bibliographical information, see [http://www.worldcat.org/title/traite-complet-de-la-theorie-et-de-la-pratique-de-lharmonie-contenant-la-doctrine-de-la-science-et-de-lart/oclc/9892650/editions?editionsView=true&amp;referer=br worldcat.org].

In contrast, Hugo Riemann believed tonality, "affinities between tones" or ''Tonverwandtschaften'', was entirely natural and, following [[Moritz Hauptmann|Moritz]] {{harvtxt|Hauptmann|1853}}, that the major third and perfect fifth were the only "directly intelligible" intervals, and that I, IV, and V, the tonic, subdominant, and dominant were related by the perfect fifths between their root notes {{harv|Dahlhaus|1990|loc=101–02}}.

It is in this era that the word ''tonality'' was popularized by Fétis {{harv|Wangermée and Ellis|2001}}.

Theorists such as [[Hugo Riemann]], and later [[Edward Lowinsky|Edward]] {{harvtxt|Lowinsky|1962}} and others, pushed back the date when modern tonality began, and the [[cadence (music)|cadence]] began to be seen as the definitive way that a tonality is established in a work of music {{harv|Judd|1998}}.

In the music of some late-Romantic or [[post-Romantic]] composers such as [[Richard Wagner]], [[Hugo Wolf]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], and others, we find a variety of harmonic and linear procedures that have the effect of weakening functional tonality. These procedures may produce a suspension of tonality or may create a sense of tonal ambiguity, even to the point that at times the sense of tonality is completely lost. [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] described this kind of tonality (with references to the music of Wagner, Mahler, and himself, amongst others) as "aufgehobene Tonalität" and "schwebende Tonalität" {{harv|Schoenberg|1922|loc=444, 459–60}}, usually rendered in English as "suspended" ("not in effect", "cancelled") tonality and "fluctuating" ("suspended", "not yet decided") tonality, respectively {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=383}}.

=== 20th century ===
In the early 20th century, the tonality that had prevailed since the 17th century was seen to have reached a crisis or break down point. Because of the "...increased use of the ambiguous chords, the less probable harmonic progressions, and the more unusual melodic and rhythmic inflections,"{{harv|Meyer|1967|loc=241}} the syntax of functional harmony loosened to the point where, "At best, the felt probabilities of the style system had become obscure; at worst, they were approaching a uniformity which provided few guides for either composition or listening."{{harv|Meyer|1967|loc=241}}

Tonality may be considered generally, with no restrictions on the date or place the music was produced, and little restriction on the materials and methods used. This definition includes pre-17th century western music, as well as much non-western music. By the middle of the 20th century, it had become "evident that triadic structure does not necessarily generate a tone center, that non-triadic harmonic formations may be made to function as referential elements, and that the assumption of a twelve-tone complex does not preclude the existence of tone centers" {{harv|Perle|1991|loc=8}}. For the composer and theorist [[George Perle]], tonality is not "a matter of 'tone-centeredness', whether based on a 'natural' hierarchy of pitches derived from the overtone series or an 'artificial' pre compositional ordering of the pitch material; nor is it essentially connected to the kinds of pitch structures one finds in traditional diatonic music" {{harv|Pitt|1995|loc=291}}.

== Theoretical underpinnings ==

One area of disagreement going back to the origin of the term tonality is whether tonality is ''natural'' or inherent in acoustical phenomena, whether it is inherent in the human nervous system or a psychological construct, whether it is inborn or learned, and to what degree it is all these things {{harv|Meyer|1967|loc=236}}. A viewpoint held by many theorists since the third quarter of the 19th century, following the publication in 1862 of the first edition of Helmholtz's ''On the Sensation of Tone'' {{harv|Helmholtz|1877}}, holds that diatonic scales and tonality arise from natural overtones ({{harvnb|Riemann|1872}}, {{harvnb|Riemann|1875}}, {{harvnb|Riemann|1882}}, {{harvnb|Riemann|1893}}, {{harvnb|Riemann|1905}}, {{harvnb|Riemann|1914–15}}; {{harvnb|Schenker|1906–35}}; {{harvnb|Hindemith|1937–70}}).

[[Rudolph Réti]] differentiates between harmonic tonality of the traditional kind found in [[homophony]], and melodic tonality, as in [[monophony]]. In the harmonic kind, tonality is produced through the [[dominant (music)|V]]-[[tonic (music)|I]] [[chord progression]], &lt;d&gt; &lt;t&gt;. He argues that in the progression I-x-V-I (and all progressions), V-I is the only step "which ''as such'' produces the effect of tonality," and that all other chord successions, diatonic or not, being more or less similar to the tonic-dominant, are "the composer's free invention." He describes melodic tonality (the term coined independently and 10 years earlier by Estonian composer [[Jaan Soonvald]] {{harv|Rais|1992|loc=46}}) as being "entirely different from the classical type," wherein, "the whole line is to be understood as a musical unit mainly through its relationship to this basic note [the tonic]," this note not always being the tonic as interpreted according to harmonic tonality. His examples are ancient Jewish and [[Gregorian chant]] and other Eastern music, and he points out how these melodies often may be interrupted at any point and returned to the tonic, yet harmonically tonal melodies, such as that from Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' below, are actually "strict [[Harmonic rhythm|harmonic-rhythmic]] pattern[s]," and include many points "from which it is impossible, that is, illogical, unless we want to destroy the innermost sense of the whole line" to return to the tonic ({{harvnb|Reti|1958}}, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}).

Consequently, he argues, melodically tonal melodies resist harmonization and only reemerge in western music after, "harmonic tonality was abandoned," as in the music of [[Claude Debussy]]: "melodic tonality plus [[modulation (music)|modulation]] is [Debussy's] modern tonality" {{harv|Reti|1958|loc=23}}.

== Outside common-practice period ==
The noun "tonality" and adjective "tonal" are widely applied also, in studies of early and modern Western music, and in non-Western traditional music ([[Arabic maqam]], Indian [[raga]], Indonesian [[slendro]] etc.), to the "systematic arrangements of pitch phenomena and relations between them" ({{harvnb|Hyer|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hyer|2002}}). Felix Wörner, Ullrich Scheideler, and Philip Rupprecht in the introduction to a collection of essays dedicated to the concept and practice of tonality between 1900 and 1950 describe it generally as "the awareness of key in music" {{harv|Wörner, Scheideler, and Rupprecht|2012|loc=11}}.

[[Harold Powers]], in a series of articles, used terms "sixteenth-century tonalities" ({{harvnb|Powers|1981|loc=439}}; {{harvnb|Powers|1992|loc=12}}; {{harvnb|Powers|1996|loc=221}}) and "Renaissance tonality" {{harv|Powers|1996|loc=226}}. He borrowed German "Tonartentyp" from [[:de:Siegfried Hermelink|Siegfried]] {{harvtxt|Hermelink|1960}}, who related it to Palestrina, translated it into English as "tonal type" {{harv|Powers|1981|loc=439}}, and systematically applied the concept of "tonal types" to Renaissance sacred and paraliturgical polyphony. Cristle Collins Judd (the author of many articles and a thesis dedicated to the early pitch systems) found "tonalities" in this sense in motets of [[Josquin Desprez]] {{harv|Judd|1992}}. Judd also wrote of "chant-based tonality" {{harv|Judd|1998c}}, meaning "tonal" polyphonic compositions based on plainchant. Peter Lefferts found "tonal types" in the French polyphonic chanson of the 14th century {{harv|Lefferts|1995}}, Italian musicologists Marco Mangani and Daniele Sabaino in the late Renaissance music {{harv|Mangani and Sabaino|2008}}, and so on.

The wide usage of "tonality" and "tonal" has been supported by several other musicologists (of diverse provenance); it can be traced, e.g., in the articles collected in {{harvnb|Judd|1998a}}. A possible reason for this broader usage of terms "tonality" and "tonal" is the attempt to translate German "Tonart" as "tonality" and "Tonarten-" prefix as "tonal" (for example, it is rendered so in the seminal ''New Grove'' article "Mode", {{harvnb|Powers et al.|2001|loc=§V, 1, et passim}}; {{harvnb|Powers|1981|loc=441}}; {{harvnb|Powers|1982|loc=59, 61}} etc.). Therefore, two different German words "Tonart" and "Tonalität" have sometimes been translated as "tonality" although they are not the same words in German.

[[File:Hugo Riemann, "Tonalität," Musik-Lexikon (1882) PNG.png|thumb|Riemann's illustration of a non-diatonic cadence possessing ''Tonalität'' without ''Tonart'' {{harv|Kopp|2011|loc=401}} {{audio|Hugo Riemann, "Tonalität," Musik-Lexikon (1882) MID.mid|Play}}]]
In 1882, Hugo Riemann defined the term ''Tonalität'' specifically to include chromatic as well as diatonic relationships to a tonic, in contrast to the usual diatonic concept of ''Tonart''. In the [[neo-Riemannian theory]] of the late 20th century, however, the same chromatic chord relations cited by Riemann came to be regarded as a fundamental example of nontonal triadic relations, reinterpreted as a product of the hexatonic cycle (the six-pitch-class set forming a scale of alternating minor thirds and semitones, [[Forte number|Forte's set-type]] 6–20, but manifested as a succession of from four to six alternating major and minor triads), defined without reference to a tonic ({{harvnb|Cohn|1996|loc=18, et passim}}; {{harvnb|Kopp|2011|loc=401}}).

In the 20th century, music that no longer conformed to the strict definition of common-practice tonality could nevertheless still involve musical phenomena (harmonies, cadential formulae, harmonic progressions, melodic gestures, formal categories) arranged or understood in relation to a referential tonic {{harv|Hyer|2001}}. For example, the closing bars of the first movement of [[Béla Bartók]]'s ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta]]'' do not involve a composed-out triad, but rather a diverging-converging pair of chromatic lines moving from a unison A to an octave E{{Music|flat}} and back to a unison A again, providing a framing "deep structure" based on a tritone relationship that nevertheless is not analogous to a tonic-dominant axis, but rather remains within the single functional domain of the tonic, A {{harv|Agawu|2009|loc=72}}. To distinguish this species of tonality (found also, for example, in the music of [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein|Bernstein]], [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]], [[Irving Fine|Fine]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], and, especially, Stravinsky) from the stricter kind associated with the 18th century, some writers use the term "[[neotonality]]" ({{harvnb|Burkholder, Grout, and Palisca|2009|loc=838, 885}}; {{harvnb|Silberman|2006|loc=v, 2, 33, 37, 58, 65, 108}}), while others prefer to use the term ''centricity'' {{harv|Straus|2000|loc=112–14}}, and still others retain the term, ''tonality'' {{harv|White|1979|loc=558}}, in its broader sense, or use word combinations like ''extended tonality'' ({{harvnb|Kholopov}}; {{harvnb|Lyzhov}}).

== Computational methods to determine the key ==
In [[music information retrieval]], techniques have been developed to determine the key of a piece of [[Classical music|classical Western music]] (recorded in audio data format) automatically. These methods are often based on a compressed representation of the pitch content in a 12-dimensional [[pitch-class]] profile (chromagram) and a subsequent procedure that finds the best match between this representation and one of the prototype vectors of the 24 minor and major keys {{harv|Purwins, Blankertz, and Obermayer|2000|loc=270–72}}. For implementation, often the [[constant-Q transform]] is used, displaying the musical signal on a log frequency scale. Although a radical (over)simplification of the concept of tonality, such methods can predict the key of classical Western music well for most pieces. Other methods also take into consideration the sequentiality of music.

There has been much research on the [[nanotoxicology]] of [[fullerene]]s and [[carbon nanotubes]].

==Fullerenes==

A review of works on fullerene toxicity by Lalwani et al. found little evidence that C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic.&lt;ref name="Full Text PDF"&gt;G. Lalwani and B. Sitharaman, Multifunctional fullerene and metallofullerene based nanobiomaterials, NanoLIFE 08/2013; 3:1342003. DOI: 10.1142/S1793984413420038 [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257187642_Multifunctional_Fullerene-_and_Metallofullerene-Based_Nanobiomaterials?ev=prf_pub/ Full Text PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The toxicity of these carbon nanoparticles varies with dose, duration, type (e.g., C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, M@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, M@C&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;, functional groups used to water-solubilize these nanoparticles (e.g., OH, COOH), and method of administration (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal).  The authors recommended that the pharmacology of each fullerene- or metallofullerene-based complex be assessed as a different compound.

In a 2012 primary study of an olive oil / C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; suspension administered to rats by intra-peritoneal administration or oral [[gavage]], a prolonged lifespan to almost double the normal lifespan of the rats was seen and significant toxicity was not observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baati|first=Tarek|author2=Bourasset F |author3=Gharbi N |author4=Njim L |author5=Abderrabba M |author6=Kerkeni A |author7=Szwarc H |author8=Moussa F |title=The prolongation of the lifespan of rats by repeated oral administration of [60] fullerene|journal=Biomaterials|date=June 2012|volume=33|issue=19|pages=4936–4946|url=http://extremelongevity.net/wp-content/uploads/C60-Fullerene.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.03.036|pmid=22498298}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An investigator for this study, Professor Moussa, generalized from its findings in a video interview and stated that pure C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; is not toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Moussa, Loera (Director) | date=8 October 2012 | title=Full Interview With Professor Fathi Moussa | url = http://c60.net/full-interview-with-professor-fathi-moussa/ C60 Olive Oil| medium=Television production | location=Paris | publisher=Loera, C60.NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering toxicological data, care must be taken to distinguish as necessary between what are normally referred to as fullerenes: (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, ...); fullerene derivatives: C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; or other fullerenes with covalently bonded chemical groups; fullerene complexes (e.g., water-solubilized with surfactants, such as C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-[[Polyvinylpyrrolidone|PVP]]; host-guest complexes, such as with [[cyclodextrin]]), where the fullerene is supermolecular bound to another molecule; C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles, which are extended solid-phase aggregates of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; crystallites; and nanotubes, which are generally much larger (in terms of molecular weight and size) molecules, and are different in shape to the spheroidal fullerenes C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as having different chemical and physical properties.

The molecules above are all fullerenes (close-caged all-carbon molecules) but it is unreliable to extrapolate results from C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; to nanotubes or vice versa, as they range from insoluble materials in either hydrophilic or lipophilic media, to hydrophilic, lipophilic, or even amphiphilic molecules, and with other varying physical and chemical properties. A quantitative structural analysis relationship ([[QSAR]]) study can analyze on how close the molecules under consideration are in physical and chemical properties, can help.

==Carbon nanotubes==
[[File:Carbon nanotubes penetrating lung cell.tif|thumb|A multiwalled carbon nanotube pierces an [[Alveolar cells|alveolar epithelial cell]].]]

As of 2013, the United States [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] was not aware of any reports of adverse health effects in workers using or producing carbon nanotubes or [[carbon nanofiber]]s. However a [[systematic review]] of 54 laboratory animal studies indicated that they could cause adverse pulmonary effects including [[inflammation]], [[granuloma]]s, and [[pulmonary fibrosis]], which were of similar or greater potency when compared with other known [[Fibrosis|fibrogenic]] materials such as [[Silica gel|silica]], [[asbestos]], and ultrafine [[carbon black]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

With reference to nanotubes, a 2008 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It should be noted that this was not an inhalation study, though there have been several performed in the past, therefore it is premature to conclude that nanotubes should be considered to have a toxicological profile similar to asbestos. Conversely, and perhaps illustrative of how the various classes of molecules which fall under the general term fullerene cover a wide range of properties, Sayes ''et al.'' found that ''in vivo'' inhalation of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; and nano-C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; in rats gave no effect, whereas in comparison quartz particles produced an inflammatory response under the same conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated above, nanotubes are quite different in chemical and physical properties to C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e., molecular weight, shape, size, physical properties (such as solubility) all are very different, so from a toxicological standpoint, different results for C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and nanotubes are not suggestive of any discrepancy in the findings.

A 2016 study reported on workers in a large-scale MWCNT manufacturing facility in Russia with relatively high occupational exposure levels, finding that exposure to MWCNTs caused significant increase in several inflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers for interstitial lung disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Fatkhutdinova LM, Khaliullin TO, Vasil'yeva OL, Zalyalov RR, Mustafin IG, Kisin ER, Birch ME, Yanamala N, Shvedova AA|first=|date=2016-05-15|title=Fibrosis biomarkers in workers exposed to MWCNTs|url=|journal=Toxicol Appl Pharmacol|volume=299|issue=|pages=125–31|doi=10.1016/j.taap.2016.02.016|pmid=26902652|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toxicity ===

The toxicity of carbon nanotubes has been an important question in nanotechnology. As of 2007, such research had just begun. The data is still fragmentary and subject to criticism. Preliminary results highlight the difficulties in evaluating the toxicity of this heterogeneous material. Parameters such as structure, size [[Frequency distribution|distribution]], [[surface area]], surface chemistry, [[surface charge]], and [[Flocculation|agglomeration]] state as well as purity of the samples, have considerable impact on the [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] of carbon nanotubes. However, available data clearly show that, under some conditions, nanotubes can cross membrane barriers, which suggests that, if raw materials reach the organs, they can induce harmful effects such as inflammatory and fibrotic reactions.&lt;ref name=tox1&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kolosnjaj J, Szwarc H, Moussa F |title=Toxicity studies of carbon nanotubes |journal=Adv Exp Med Biol |volume=620 |pages=181–204 |year=2007 |pmid=18217344 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-76713-0_14 |series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology |isbn=978-0-387-76712-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Corredor |first=C. |first2=W.C. |last2=Hou |first3=S.A. |last3=Klein |first4=B.Y. |last4=Moghadam |first5=M. |last5=Goryll |first6=K.|last6=Doudrick |first7=P. |last7=Westerhoff |first8=J.D. |last8=Posner |title=Disruption of model cell membranes by carbon nanotubes |journal=Carbon |year=2013 |volume=60 |pages=67–75 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.03.057 |doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2013.03.057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects Characterization ====
In 2014, experts from the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)]] assessed the carcinogenicity of CNTs, including SWCNTs and MWCNTs. No human epidemiologic or cancer data was available to the IARC Working Group at the time, so the evaluation focused on the results of ''[[in vivo]]'' animal studies assessing the carcinogenicity of SWCNTs and MWCNTs in rodents.

The Working Group concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the specific MWCNT type “MWCNT-7”, limited evidence for the two other types of MWCNTs with dimensions similar to MWCNT-7, and inadequate evidence for SWCNTs. Therefore, it was agreed to specifically classify MWCNT-7 as possibly carcinogenic to humans ([[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]]) while the other forms of CNT, namely SWCNT and other types of MWCNT, excluding MWCNT-7, were considered not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans ([[List of IARC Group 3 carcinogens|Group 3]]) due to a lack of coherent evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grosse|first=Yann|date=30 October 2014|title=Carcinogenicity of fluoro-edenite, silicon carbide fibres and whiskers, and carbon nanotubes|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045%2814%2971109-X/fulltext#bib1|journal=The Lancet Oncology|volume=15|pages=1427–1428|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(14)71109-X|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results of [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]] collectively show that regardless of the process by which CNTs were synthesized and the types and amounts of metals they contained, CNTs were capable of producing [[inflammation]], [[Granuloma|epithelioid granulomas]] (microscopic nodules), [[fibrosis]], and biochemical/toxicological changes in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;Zumwalde, Ralph and Laura Hodson (March 2009). [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-125/ "Approaches to Safe Nanotechnology: Managing the Health and Safety Concerns Associated with Engineered Nanomaterials"]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. NIOSH (DHHS) Publication 2009-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative toxicity studies in which mice were given equal weights of test materials showed that SWCNTs were more toxic than [[quartz]], which is considered a serious occupational health hazard when chronically inhaled. As a control, ultrafine [[carbon black]] was shown to produce minimal lung responses.&lt;ref name="tox3"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam CW, James JT, McCluskey R, Arepalli S, Hunter RL |title=A review of carbon nanotube toxicity and assessment of potential occupational and environmental health risks |journal=Crit Rev Toxicol.|volume=36|pages=189–217 |year=2006 |pmid=16686422 |doi=10.1080/10408440600570233 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon nanotubes deposit in the [[alveolar ducts]] by aligning lengthwise with the airways; the nanotubes will often combine with metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The significance of nano particles in particle-induced pulmonary fibrosis|author1=James D Byrne|author2=John A Baugh|journal=McGill Journal of Medicine|year=2008|volume=11|issue=1|pages=43–50|pmc=2322933|pmid=18523535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The needle-like fiber shape of CNTs is similar to [[asbestos fibers]]. This raises the idea that widespread use of carbon nanotubes may lead to [[pleural]] mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lungs, or [[peritoneal mesothelioma]], a cancer of the lining of the abdomen (both caused by exposure to asbestos). A recently published pilot study supports this prediction.&lt;ref name="tox5" /&gt; Scientists exposed the [[mesothelial]] lining of the body cavity of mice to long multiwalled carbon nanotubes and observed asbestos-like, length-dependent, pathogenic behavior that included inflammation and formation of lesions known as [[granulomas]]. Authors of the study conclude:
{{quote|This is of considerable importance, because research and business communities continue to invest heavily in carbon nanotubes for a wide range of products under the assumption that they are no more hazardous than graphite.

Although further research is required, the available data suggest that under certain conditions, especially those involving chronic exposure, carbon nanotubes can pose a serious risk to human health.&lt;ref name=tox1/&gt;&lt;ref name="tox2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Alexandra|last2=Gass|first2=Mhairi|last3=Muller|first3=Karin|last4=Skepper|first4=Jeremy N.|last5=Midgley|first5=Paul A.|last6=Welland|first6=Mark|year=2007|title=Direct imaging of single-walled carbon nanotubes in cells|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=2|issue=11|pages=713–7|bibcode=2007NatNa...2..713P|doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.347|pmid=18654411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tox3/&gt;&lt;ref name=tox5/&gt;

==== Exposure Characterization ====
Exposure scenarios are important to consider when trying to determine toxicity and the risks associated with these diverse and difficult to study materials.  Exposure studies have been conducted over the past several years in an effort to determine where and how likely exposures will be. Since CNTs are being incorporated into composite materials for their ability to strengthen materials while not adding significant weight, the manufacture of CNTs and composites or hybrids including CNTs, the subsequent processing of the articles and equipment made from the composites, and end of life processes such as recycling or incineration all represent potential sources of exposure.  The potential for exposure to the end user is not as likely, however as CNTs are being incorporated into new products there may be more research needed.&lt;ref&gt;Nowack, Bernd; David, Raymond M.; Fissan, Heinz; Morris, Howard; Shatkin, Jo Anne; Stintz, Michael; Zepp, Richard; Brouwer, Derk. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2013.04.003 "Potential release scenarios for carbon nanotubes used in composites"]. ''Environment International''. '''59''': 1–11. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.envint.2013.04.003 10.1016/j.envint.2013.04.003]&lt;/ref&gt;

One study performed personal and area sampling at seven different plants mostly involving the manufacture of MWCNTs.  This study found that the work processes that prompt nanoparticle, not necessarily just CNT release, include “spraying, CNT preparation, ultrasonic dispersion, wafer heating, and opening the water bath cover.”  The exposure concentrations for both personal and area sampling indicated most workers’ exposure was well below that set by the ACGIH for carbon black.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Ji Hyun; Lee, Seung-Bok; Bae, Gwi Nam; Jeon, Ki Soo; Yoon, Jin Uk; Ji, Jun Ho; Sung, Jae Hyuck; Lee, Byung Gyu; Lee, Jong Han (2010-04-01). [[doi:10.3109/08958370903367359|"Exposure assessment of carbon nanotube manufacturing workplaces"]]. ''Inhalation Toxicology''. '''22''' (5): 369–381.

Processing composite materials presents potential for exposure during cutting, drilling, or abrasion.  Two different composite types were laboratory tested during processing under differing conditions to determine potential releases.  Samples were machined using one dry cutting process and one wet cutting process with measurements taken at the source and in the breathing zone.  The composites tested varied by method of manufacture and components.  One was graphite and epoxy layered with CNTs aligned within and the other was a woven alumina with aligned CNTs on the surface. Dry cutting of both proved to be of concern regarding concentrations measured at the breathing zone, while wet cutting, a preferred method, showed a much better method of controlling potential exposures during this type of processing.&lt;ref&gt;Bello, Dhimiter; Wardle, Brian L.; Yamamoto, Namiko; deVilloria, Roberto Guzman; Garcia, Enrique J.; Hart, Anastasios J.; Ahn, Kwangseog; Ellenbecker, Michael J.; Hallock, Marilyn (2009-01-01).

Another study provided breathing zone and area sampling results from fourteen sites working with CNTs in a variety of manners for potential exposure assessment.  These sites included the manufacture of CNTs, hybrid producers/users, and secondary manufacturers in either the electronics industry or composites industry.  The highest mean exposures found in breathing zone samples were found in the secondary manufactures of electronics, then composites and hybrid sites, while the lowest mean exposures were found at the primary manufacturers sites.  Relatively few of the samples returned results higher than the recommended exposure level as published by NIOSH.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dahm, Matthew M.; Schubauer-Berigan, Mary K.; Evans, Douglas E.; Birch, M. Eileen; Fernback, Joseph E.; Deddens, James A. (2015-07-01). [https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/59/6/705/2196145 "Carbon Nanotube and Nanofiber Exposure Assessments: An Analysis of 14 Site Visits"]. ''The Annals of Occupational Hygiene''. '''59''' (6): 705–723. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fannhyg%2Fmev020 10.1093/annhyg/mev020]. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] [https://www.worldcat.org/issn/0003-4878 0003-4878].&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are developing strategies for the use of CNTs in a variety of products, potentials for exposures thus far appear to be low in most occupational settings. This may change as new products and manufacturing methods or secondary processing advances; therefore risk assessments should be integral to any planning for new applications.

=== Epidemiology and Risk Management ===

==== Summary of Epidemiology Studies ====
Currently, there is a lack of epidemiological evidence linking exposure to CNT to human health effects. To date, there have been only a handful of published epidemiological studies that have solely examined the health effects related to the exposure of CNT, while several other studies are currently underway and yet to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fatkhutdinova|first=Liliya M.|last2=Khaliullin|first2=Timur O.|last3=Vasil'yeva|first3=Olga L.|last4=Zalyalov|first4=Ramil R.|last5=Mustafin|first5=Ilshat G.|last6=Kisin|first6=Elena R.|last7=Birch|first7=M.

This limitation of human data has led to the use of the precautionary principle, which urges workplaces to limit exposure levels to CNT as low as possibly achievable in the absence of known health effects data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schulte|first=Paul A.|last2=Kuempel|first2=Eileen D.|last3=Zumwalde|first3=Ralph D.|last4=Geraci|first4=Charles L.|last5=Schubauer-Berigan|first5=Mary K.|last6=Castranova|first6=Vincent|last7=Hodson|first7=Laura|last8=Murashov|first8=Vladimir|last9=Dahm|first9=Matthew M.|date=1 May 2012|title=Focused actions to protect carbon nanotube workers|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajim.22028/abstract|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|language=en|volume=55|issue=5|pages=395–411|doi=10.1002/ajim.22028|issn=1097-0274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiology studies of nanomaterials thus far have considered a variety of nanomaterials.  Few have been specific to CNTs and each has considered a small sample size.  These studies have found some relationships between biological markers and MWCNT exposure. One cross-sectional study to evaluate health effects was conducted to determine associations of biomarkers in relation to measured CNT exposure.  While no effect on lung function due to exposure was found, the study did observe some indications of early signs of effects to biomarkers associated with exposure to MWCNTs. Additionally, some results were contradictory to earlier in vitro studies making further studies necessary to further define effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liou, Saou-Hsing; Tsai, Candace S.

==== NIOSH Risk Assessment Summary ====
NIOSH has undertaken a risk assessment based on available studies to determine appropriate recommendations of exposure levels. Their review found that while human health effects had not been directly observed, there were animal studies that showed potential for health effects that could reasonably be expected in humans upon sufficient exposure. In addition to animal studies, human cell studies were reviewed and determined that harmful effects were expressed.  Ultimately, the risk assessment found the most relevant data upon which to calculate the REL were animal studies.  Corrections for inter-species differences, and updates to reflect advancing technologies in sampling methods and detection capabilities were considered as a part of the risk assessment. The resultant REL is several orders of magnitude smaller than those of other carbonaceous particulate matters of concern, graphite and carbon black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-145/pdfs/2013-145.pdf|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 65:  Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Risk Management ====
To date, several international government agencies, as well as individual authors, have developed [[occupational exposure limit]]s (OEL) to reduce the risk of any possible human health effects associated with workplace exposures to CNT. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) conducted a risk assessment using animal and other toxicological data relevant to assessing the potential non-malignant adverse respiratory effects of CNT and proposed an OEL of 1 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; elemental carbon as a respirable mass 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) concentration.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-145/|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 65: Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers|last=|first=|date=April 2013|website=|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=v ''et al.''|access-date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several individual authors have also performed similar risk assessments using animal toxicity data and have established inhalation exposure limits ranging from 2.5 to 50&amp;nbsp;ug/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broekhuizen|first=Pieter Van|last2=Veelen|first2=Wim Van|last3=Streekstra|first3=Willem-Henk|last4=Schulte|first4=Paul|last5=Reijnders|first5=Lucas|date=1 July 2012|title=Exposure Limits for Nanoparticles: Report of an International Workshop on Nano Reference Values|url=http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/5/515|journal=Annals of Occupational Hygiene|language=en|volume=56|issue=5|pages=515–524|doi=10.1093/annhyg/mes043|issn=0003-4878|pmid=22752096}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such risk assessment used two data from two different types of exposures to work toward an OEL as part of an adaptive management where there is an expectation that recommendations will be reevaluated as more data become available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakanishi|first=Junko|last2=Morimoto|first2=Yasuo|last3=Ogura|first3=Isamu|last4=Kobayashi|first4=Norihiro|last5=Naya|first5=Masato|last6=Ema|first6=Makoto|last7=Endoh|first7=Shigehisa|last8=Shimada|first8=Manabu|last9=Ogami|first9=Akira|date=2015-10-01|title=Risk Assessment of the Carbon Nanotube Group|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.12394/abstract|journal=Risk Analysis|language=en|volume=35|issue=10|pages=1940–1956|doi=10.1111/risa.12394|issn=1539-6924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety and Exposure Prevention ===
Occupational exposures that could potentially allow the inhalation of CNT is of the greatest concern, especially in situations where the CNT is handled in powder form which can easily be aerosolized and inhaled. Also of concern are any high-energy processes that are applied to various CNT preparations such as the mixing or sonication of CNT in liquids as well as processes that cut or drill into CNT based composites in downstream products. These types of high-energy processes will aerosolize CNT which can then be inhaled.

Guidance for minimizing exposure and risk to CNT have been published by several international agencies which includes several documents from the British [[Health and Safety Executive]] titled "Using nanomaterials at work Including carbon nanotubes  and other bio-persistent high aspect ratio nanomaterials" and the "Risk Management of Carbon Nanotubes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg272.htm|title=Using nanomaterials at work|website=www.hse.gov.uk|access-date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/nanotechnology/risk-management-basic.htm|title=Risk management basics - Nanotechnology - HSE|website=www.hse.gov.uk|access-date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Safe Work Australia]] has also published guidance titled "Safe Handling and use of Carbon Nanotubes" which describes two approaches to managing the risks that include risk management with detailed hazard analysis and exposure assessment as well as risk management by using [[Control banding|Control Banding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/about/publications/pages/safe-handling-nanotubes|title=Safe handling and use of carbon nanotubes - Safe Work Australia|website=www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au|access-date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has also published a document titled "Current Intelligence Bulletin 65: Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers" describes strategies for controlling workplace exposures and implementing a medical surveillance program.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has published a “[https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA_FS-3634.pdf OSHA Fact Sheet, Working Safety with Nanomaterials”] for use as guidance in addition to a webpage hosting a variety of resources.

These guidance documents generally advocate instituting the principles of the [[Hierarchy of hazard control|Hierarchy of Hazard Control]] which is a system used in industry to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards. The hazard controls in the hierarchy are, in order of decreasing effectiveness:
* Elimination of a potential exposure.
* Substitution with a less hazardous chemical or process.
* Engineering Controls such as ventilation systems, shielding, or enclosures.
* Administrative Controls including training, policies, written procedures, work schedules, etc.
* [[Personal protective equipment|Personal Protective Equipment]]

A [[viewshed]] is an area that is visible from a specific location. '''Viewshed analyses''' are a common function of most [[geographic information system]] (GIS) software. The analysis uses the elevation value of each cell of the [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) to determine visibility to or from a particular cell. The location of this particular cell varies depending on the needs of the analysis. 
For example, a viewshed analysis is commonly used to locate communication towers or determining the view from a road. Viewsheds can be calculated using an individual point such as a tower or multiple points such as a line representing a road. When analyzing a line segment, each of the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] along the line is calculated to determine its visible area. The process can also be reversed. For example, when locating a [[landfill]], the analysis can determine from where the landfill is visible to keep it hidden from view.

== Viewshed analysis process ==
A viewshed analysis can be performed using one of many [[GIS]] programs, such as [[GRASS GIS]] (r.los, r.viewshed), [http://www.luciad.com/solutions/luciadlightspeed LuciadLightspeed], [http://www.luciad.com/solutions/luciadmobile LuciadMobile], [[SAGA GIS]] (Visibility), TNT Mips, [[ArcMap]], [[Maptitude]], [[ERDAS IMAGINE]]. A viewshed is created from a [[digital elevation model|DEM]] by using an algorithm that estimates the difference of elevation from one cell (the viewpoint cell) to the next (the target cell). To determine the visibility of a target cell, each cell between the viewpoint cell and target cell is examined for line of sight. Where cells of higher value are between the viewpoint and target cells the line of sight is blocked. If the line of sight is blocked then the target cell is determined to not be part of the viewshed. If it is not blocked then it is included in the viewshed (Kim et al., 2004).

The algorithm is also based on a given set of variables. When performing a viewshed analysis, several variables can be used to limit or adjust the calculation. For example, if the analysis is to determine the location of a radio tower, the height of the tower could be added to the elevation of that location (cell value). If no height is given, then the viewshed analysis uses the cell value of the DEM in which the tower is located.

Another way to add the height of the tower is to use an offset variable. Offset values can be added to a sending tower as well as a receiving tower. The offset value is then added to the elevation value of the cell to obtain the actual elevation of each tower.

The viewshed analysis can also have a limited viewing angle. The viewing angle, or [[azimuth]], of the radio tower can be incorporated into the calculation by adding two values. The first value is the lowest possible azimuth angle and the second value is the highest possible azimuth angle. The program will analyze the viewshed only within these given azimuth angles. 
A vertical angle can be added as well. The values for vertical angle are from 90° (looking straight up) to -90° (looking straight down). This variable would need to be added in cases where the radio tower emits a very narrow vertical beam.
The final variable used in the viewshed analysis is the radius value. In the case of the radio tower, if the radio signal has a limited range, perhaps 10 miles, then the radius variable can be set to limit the viewshed analysis to a 10-mile radius.

== Viewshed analysis uses ==
Besides tower placement a viewshed analysis can be used for other applications. For example, a viewshed analysis could estimate the impact of the addition of a large building. The viewshed analysis would show all the areas from which the building could be seen as well as any views that would be obscured from any particular location. Viewshed analyses are also used to locate [[fire lookout tower|fire observation stations]] in mountain areas (Lee and Stucky, 1998). This allows the stations to be placed so that the entire forest can be observed for possible fires.

An example of using a viewshed analysis on a line segment is from the [[Wyoming]] State Office, [[Bureau of Land Management]], in which the office used a viewshed analysis to determine the visibility from [[National Historic Trail]]s across Wyoming. Within the Rock Springs Field Office area there are five different viewsheds to choose from. The example here is viewshed number one. The viewshed indicates the land areas visible from the trails at four different levels from not visible to visible, based on the number of times the area could be seen from the trail. This is an indication of what the pioneers could see as they traveled along the trails of the western frontier (Rock Springs Field Office).

== A unique viewshed analysis ==
[[File:mars viewshed.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gusev (Martian crater)|Gusev crater]] on Mars: the viewshed (red) is overlaid on an elevation map]]
In another example the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) used a viewshed analysis to assist [[NASA]]'s [[Mars Exploration Rover]] (MER) project. When NASA needed to find appropriate landing spots for the [[Mars]] rovers, they turned to the USGS to map the best possible sites. Part of the analysis included a viewshed of the possible site selections. In this case the viewshed indicates the areas which may or may not be visible by the Mars rovers from each landing site (MER Landing Site Viewshed Analysis).

'''War studies''', sometimes called '''polemology''', is the [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] study of [[war]]. The word derives from Ancient Greek πόλεμος (pólemos, "war") + -logy".

Polemology is distinct from [[military history]] in that it encompasses a variety of fields:
*[[Laws of war]]
*[[Philosophy of war]]
**[[Ethics of war]]
***[[Just war theory]]
**[[Deterrence theory]]
*[[Psychology of war]]
**[[Post traumatic stress disorder]]
**[[Psychological operations]]
*[[Military history]]
*[[Military science]]
*[[War#Theories for motivation|Motivations]], conduct and [[effect of war]]
*[[Economics of war]]
*[[Sociology of war]]
*[[Sociology of the military]]
*[[International relations]]
**[[International relations theory]]
*[[Political science]]
*[[Anthropology]]

==Programs==
War studies is a multi-disciplinary program. Students explore the [[military]], [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], [[philosophy of war|philosophical]], [[social]], [[political]], [[psychological]] or [[economic]] dimensions of human [[War|conflict]]. In the context of [[modern warfare]], it considers issues of defence [[Military policy|policy]], [[Military strategy|strategic planning]], [[Military logistics|logistics]] and [[Military operations|operations]]

==Students==
War studies programs may be aimed at military students in the regular and reserve forces, non-commissioned members and civilian students.
