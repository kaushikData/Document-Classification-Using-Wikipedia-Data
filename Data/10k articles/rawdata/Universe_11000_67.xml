'''2008 June Hong Kong Rainstorm''' was a rainstorm in [[Hong Kong]] on 7 June 2008, that caused flooding and landslides. It resulted in 2 deaths and 16 injuries. The [[Hong Kong Observatory]] recorded 145.5mm of precipitation at its headquarters from 08:00 to 09:00, setting the highest 1-hour precipitation record. 307.1mm of precipitation was recorded during the whole day.

== Precipitation ==
An active trough had been affecting the [[South China]] coast since May 29th, 2008. Around dawn on June 7th, rainfall arrived in Hong Kong. The rainfall mainly focused on [[Lantau Island]], [[Kowloon]] and [[Hong Kong Island]]. The peak of the precipitation was from 08:00 to 09:00 in the morning. The Hong Kong Observatory recorded 145.5mm of precipitation, a record high, at its headquarters. Precipitation at [[Tung Chung]] for the entire day even surpassed 400mm. Former Chief Executive Donald Tsang, described it as "once in a century". The Civil Engineering and Development Department of Hong Kong estimated it as a "once in 1100 years" occurrence.

== Rainstorm Signals ==
An Amber Rainstorm signal was issued at 05:15, and escalated to Red at 05:55. 112mm and 101mm of rain were recorded at the Eastern and Southern Districts respectively. 86mm was recorded at Sai Kung District. The Hong Kong Observatory eventually issued a Black Rainstorm Signal at 06:40 and it was sustained for 4 hours and 20 minutes. Red replaced Black at 11:00 and was then replaced by Amber at 11:30. All signals were cancelled at 13:30. 
A Landslide Warning was maintained from 01:00 June 7th till 12:00 June 8th.

== New Territories (Excluding Lantau Island) ==
A retaining wall at Old Coffee Bay, Castle Peak Road, [[Tuen Mun]] fell and collapsed on a store with two residents. The two residents killed were cousins visiting from mainland [[China]]. Their bodies were not unearthed until 18:30 in the evening by firefighters despite efforts of nearby residents and firefighters.

== Kowloon ==
A section of Hung Hom Road collapsed at 13:00 on June 8th due to heavy rainfall the day before, causing detours.

== Hong Kong Island ==
1.5m flood was observed at Sheung Wan, as well as seawater back-flow. Village houses in Pokfulam were flooded, as were many roads, including [[Tai Hang Road]], [[Pokfulam Road]], Water Street and Hill Road, Wong Nai Chung Road, Tin Lok Lane and Wong Chuk Hang Road. A landslide was seen at [[Kennedy Town]]. 13 slopes were pronounced at high risk of landslide after the rainstorm.

== Lantau Island ==

[[North Lantau Highway]] experienced the most severe flood ever. Major landslip occurred in Tung Chung, blocking all lanes of the highway. Ground commute between Tung Chung, [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport]] and downtown was completely halted, except for train service.

== Effects ==
- 326 landslips and 539 floods were reported&lt;br /&gt;
- 410 flights were delayed, 14 were canceled on June 7th&lt;br /&gt;
- [[Hong Kong Wetland Park]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland Resort|Disneyland Resort]] were temporarily closed in the morning&lt;br /&gt;
- [[Ngong Ping 360]] service was halted &lt;br /&gt;
- All banks and judiciary organisations closed for the day&lt;br /&gt;
- The central allocation of primary school was delayed &lt;br /&gt;
- Many hiking trails were closed, detoured or permanently blocked, especially on Lantau Island

'''Beryllium nitride''', Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a [[nitride]] of [[beryllium]]. It can be prepared from the elements at high temperature (1100–1500&amp;nbsp;°C),&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"&gt;Egon Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman (2001) ''Inorganic Chemistry'', Elsevier {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike [[Beryllium azide]] or BeN&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, it decomposes in vacuum into beryllium and nitrogen.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; It is readily hydrolysed forming beryllium hydroxide and ammonia.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; It has two polymorphic forms cubic α-Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a defect anti-fluorite structure, and hexagonal β-Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; It reacts with [[silicon nitride]], Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in a stream of ammonia at 1800–1900&amp;nbsp;°C to form BeSiN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;

==Preparation==
Beryllium nitride is prepared by heating beryllium metal powder with dry nitrogen in an oxygen-free atmosphere in temperatures between 700 and 1400&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Uses==
It is used in [[refractory]] ceramics&lt;ref&gt;Hugh O. Pierson, 1996, Handbook of Refractory Carbides and Nitrides: Properties, Characteristics, Processing, and Applications, William Andrew Inc.,{{ISBN|0-8155-1392-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[nuclear reactor]]s and to produce radioactive [[carbon-14]] for tracer applications.

==Reactions==
Beryllium nitride reacts with mineral acids producing [[ammonia]] and the corresponding salts of the acids:
: Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl → 3 BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

In strong alkali solutions, a beryllate forms, with evolution of ammonia:
: Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 NaOH → 3 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Both the acid and alkali reactions are brisk and vigorous. Reaction with water, however, is very slow:
: Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3 Be(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Reactions with oxidizing agents are likely to be violent. It is oxidized when heated at 600&amp;nbsp;°C in air.

The '''British timber trade''' was importation of timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], and later North America, by the British.  During the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Stuart period (England)|Stuart period]], Great Britain had large domestic supplies of timber, especially valuable were the famous British [[oak]]s.  This timber formed the backbone of many industries such as [[shipbuilding]] but not iron [[smelting]] which used [[charcoal]] derived from the wood of various trees.

==Origins==
From before the [[industrial revolution]] period the price of timber in England had been increasing as domestic quantities became more difficult to obtain.  Many industries thus were forced to change to substitutes.  As the industrial revolution progressed coal replaced timber for use as fuel, while brick replaced timber for use in construction.

It would be many decades, however, before iron could be used to replace timber in [[shipbuilding]].  By the eighteenth century England had not exhausted its supply of suitable domestic hardwood timber but – like the [[Netherlands]] – it imported softwood supplies. While every nation has trees and wood, ship timber is a far more limited product. The ideal woods were oak, Scots pine – but not [[spruce]], and other large trees. Especially difficult to find were trees suitable to be [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], a crucial requirement for any sailing ship, and one that often had to be replaced after storms or wear.  As suitable trees take decades to grow, in densely populated nations like England any given square metre of land could, usually, be far more valuably employed by producing foodstuffs rather than timber.

Timber was thus only a viable industry in sparsely populated lands such as [[Scandinavia]], those in the [[Baltic Sea]] area, and in North America. The [[Baltic countries]], and especially [[Norway]], had other benefits including superior [[sawmill]]s, and often lower transport prices than distant overland travel.  The British shipping industry, by the late seventeenth century, increasingly used imports of Baltic timber.

==Concerns over the timber trade==
The importation of timber from the Baltic had two notable defects in the mind of British statesmen.  The first was one of economics.  The British had a large [[trade deficit]] with the entire [[Baltic region]]. Great Britain required a large number of essential resources from the Baltic, but did not have enough goods to export to the Baltic to make up for these purchases. Thus the shortfall had to be made up in [[bullion]] exports.  This imbalance caused great displeasure among the mercantilist economists of the day. Further compounding the problem was that unlike other areas where the British had a trade deficit, such as [[India]], the Baltic trade could not be justified on the grounds that Great Britain gained in the end from re-export to the continent, Baltic goods were overwhelmingly used in Britain. Most during the later half of the seventeenth century regarded the Baltic trade as a regrettable, but necessary expenditure for the defence of the land. Some consolation was, however, provided to the [[mercantilism|mercantilists]] by the employment of the timber in the merchant fleet that would later assist in bringing bullion into the land. Also of concern was the foreign domination of the Baltic timber trade.  This problem was only partially solved by the inclusion of timber in the [[Navigation Acts]] of 1651 and 1660.  While the acts successfully excluded the Dutch from Britain's trade with the Baltic, it still allowed the Baltic countries the right to import their own timber. It was mostly the Danes, Swedes, and Germans who replaced the Dutch in this trade as British merchants did not see it as profitable enough. This was because the Baltic trade was a difficult one to profit from as one load of British manufactured goods could buy seventy loads of timber, most ships entering the Baltic were thus empty, a great inefficiency. Most British merchants could employ their ships in more profitable colonial and manufactured goods trades, an option that the Baltic merchants did not have.

These commercial problems of Baltic timber imports were compounded by a military and strategic problem. The dependency on Baltic timber was paramount in the minds of British statesmen in the late seventeenth century mostly because of the strategic dangers.   There were no trades as militarily important as the Baltic [[lumber]] trade, but there were also few more fragile.  Besides the trade coming from Norway, the timber ships had to come through the Sound – the narrow straits separating [[Denmark]] from [[Sweden]]- a passage easily blocked by enemy navies, especially the Dutch who were geographically well placed to impede trade through the [[North Sea]], as could, to a lesser extent, the French. Also threatening was the rise of Sweden who by 1690 was at the height of its brief period of being a global power.  Sweden also was a strong trade protectionist and had imposed high duties of British imports.  Sweden's empire was also expanding having seized [[Swedish Livonia|Livonia]] as well as [[Swedish Pomerania|Pomerania]], both important sources of timber.  Thus beginning with the Anglo-Dutch wars of the later seventeenth century British statesmen and merchants began to look for some alternative to these imports.

Despite commercial clamouring for regulation of the Baltic timber trade, [[Josiah Child]], for instance, thought the trade should be limited to only British vessels, no actions were taken until 1704 when British security was threatened. The great threat to Britain's security occurred during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], what some have termed the first global conflict.  Only then did the British parliament attempt to break Britain's dependence upon Baltic timber.  The only viable alternative to the Baltic areas was North America, [[New England]] especially had vast amounts of suitable timber.  The great disadvantages were a lack of infrastructure in the colonies and much higher transport costs to British markets.  Beginning in 1704 a number of initiatives were launched to try to encourage the use of colonial timber over that from the Baltic.  These encouragements included bounties from North American producers, and rules forbidding the export of colonial timber to anywhere other than England.  These efforts were quite unsuccessful, however, and both the navy and the merchant fleets remained dependent upon Baltic timber.  Baltic timber still remained about a third the price of timber from North America. After the War of the Spanish succession ended the threat to British timber supplies receded, and despite the continuation of strong mercantilist pressure to increase the protectionism this was not done for the next century.this increased the opportunities for jobs in British North America (B.N.A).

Over the entire eighteenth century Britain's naval supremacy in the North Sea area was never questioned. However, Britain's commercial position remained unfavourable.  With only occasional exceptions Britain was still in constant trade deficit with the entire [[Baltic region]]. Despite this condition being viewed as harmful by the economists of the day no action of any significance was taken to try to prevent it.  While the laws of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s era remained in place, these were well known to be totally ineffective in curbing the dependence on the Baltic.  During this period more economic disadvantages of the trade also developed. The American colonies still could exported little timber to England, only great masts could justify the cost of the long transatlantic journey. Thus New England, rather than producing timber and naval stores for the motherland was instead building its own ships that were cheaper and often of superior quality to those produced in Britain. This further violated important tenets of mercantilism and the old colonial system which considered manufacturing in the colonies to be counter Britain interests. Parliament, however, failed to be swayed by shipwrights, merchants or colonial timber producers who were hoping for an end to Baltic competition. It would again take pressure from the navy to introduce mercantilist policies.

==Trade restrictions==
The next attempt to break Britain's dependence on the Baltic once again occurred during a great Europe wide conflict that had significant naval elements.  The [[Napoleonic Wars]] reopened Britain's fears of the Baltic timber trade being severed. Denmark and the straits, like all of continental Europe, were at the mercy of Napoleon's army and many of the rest of the timber ports within the Baltic were threatened by Napoleon's [[Continental system]].   The government thus made a more concerted attempt than ever before to break Britain's dependence upon Baltic timber. Throughout the period commencing in 1795 tariffs on foreign timber imports steadily rose. Eventually in 1807 a 275% levy was placed upon all Baltic timber imports to Britain.  This levy succeeded in making Canadian timber more cost effective than that from the Baltic. Canadian timber exports to Britain more than tripled from 27,000 loads in 1807 to 90,000 loads in 1809. The sheer bulk of timber and its many requirements soon led the transatlantic timber trade to become Britain's largest employing a quarter of Britain's merchant tonnage. The previous large Baltic trade almost vanished with European wood being used only for luxury items.

After peace had returned to Britain the timber tariffs did not have long to survive. While at first they were continued, and even strengthened, by 1820 timber became one of the first areas for free trade theory to be applied.  In part this was caused by the continued existence of powerful merchants who wanted to see the old Baltic trade restored. The trading interests with the colonies were even stronger, however. The much longer voyage from [[British North America]] to Britain meant far more ships and seamen had to be employed.  The longer route not only meant more business, but it also was a more profitable route for British merchants, especially since foreigners were still excluded by the Navigation Acts. Military sources, however, disliked Canadian timber. The longer voyage lowered its quality and it was far more susceptible to the [[dry rot]] that was one of the navy's more implacable foes. A frigate made of colonial wood tended to have only half the life span of a Baltic ship.

Because of timber's great importance, in 1820 a committee of the House of Lords was formed to review the state of the timber trade. Led by [[Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] the committee strongly supported the reduction of the duties.  This has been viewed as one of the first successes of free trade ideology in Britain. The duties were not eliminated, but they were brought to a level that left Baltic wood competitive with that from Canada. These reductions were a rare example of ''laissez-faire'' in an era still almost totally committed to mercantilism. The post-war era also saw a great unwillingness to enforce the duties that were in place. Rampant smuggling of timber into and out of Norway was mostly ignored, as were the illegal exports of bullion to fund the trade. In 1824 the duties were further lowered when Britain began to sign reciprocity treaties with other powers. Out of the first ten bilateral trade treaties signed, seven of them were with Baltic nations covering all the major timber exporters except for Russia. These quick reversals of Baltic trade policy in an era before free trade was paramount can almost certainly be attributed to the navy's unwillingness to become reliant on Canadian timber now that trade with the Baltic had been unquestionably secured.

In seeking the exploit of further timber resources was one of the reasons of the [[First Anglo–Burmese War|First]] and the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–1826 and 1852, respectively). Burma had to cede Assam, Manipur, Rakhine (Arakan) and Tanintharyi (Tenessarim) and later the remaining coastal provinces: Ayeyarwady, Yangon and Bago. During the following years timber was harvested introducing new techniques. The British cut the bark off the trees and left them to dry before felling them roughly four years later with the use of elephants. Dry wood was easier to fell and floated in water and therefore the river Irrawady was used for transporting the wood to the saw mills near Rangoon.

Other sources were the wood from Australia which included Jarrah and Karri wood. Some streets in London are still paved with Karri wood from the southern parts of Western Australia. But Jarrah wood is more resistant to water and therefore more valuable then Karri in the constructions of ships.

The '''Calculated Ignition Index''' (CII) is an index of the ignition quality of residual fuel oil.

The running of all internal combustion engines is dependent on the ignition quality of the fuel. For spark-ignition engines the fuel has an octane rating. For diesel engines it depends on the type of fuel, for distillate fuels the [[cetane number]]s are used. Cetane numbers are tested using a special test engine and the existing engine was not made for residual fuels. For residual fuel oil two other empirical indexes are used CII and [[Calculated Carbon Aromaticity Index]] (CCAI). Both CII and CCAI are calculated from the [[density]] and [[viscosity|kinematic viscosity]] of the fuel.

==Definition==
Formula for CII:

 &lt;math&gt;CII = (270.795 + 0.1038T)-0.254565D+23.708 \log \log(V+0.7)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Where:&lt;br /&gt;
D = density at 15°C (kg/m³)&lt;br /&gt;
V = viscosity (cST)&lt;br /&gt;
T = viscosity temperature (°C)&lt;br /&gt;

==Use==
CII was designed to give out numbers in the same order as the cetane index for distillate fuels.

The '''continental shelf of Russia''' (also called the '''Russian continental shelf''' or the '''Arctic shelf''' in the Arctic region) is a [[continental shelf]] adjacent to [[Russia]]. Geologically, the extent of the shelf is defined as the entirety of the continental shelves adjacent to Russia's coast. In [[international law]], however, the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] more narrowly defines the extent of the shelf as the [[seabed]] and [[subsoil]] of the submarine areas over which a state exercises sovereign rights. 

The [[Siberian Shelf]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]] is the largest (and least explored) of the Russian shelves, a region of strategic importance because of its [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] reserves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Aug2007-TheBattleforthenextenergyfrontier-ShamilYenikeyeff-and-TimothyFentonKrysiek.pdf The Battle for the Next Energy Frontier: The Russian Polar Expedition and the Future of Arctic Hydrocarbons], by Shamil Midkhatovich Yenikeyeff and Timothy Fenton Krysiek, [[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]], August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of the Russian shelf are typically named after the corresponding seas: [[Barents Shelf]] ([[Barents Sea Shelf]]), [[Chukchi Sea Shelf|Chukchi Shelf]] ([[Chukchi Sea Shelf]]), etc. With the exception of internal Russian seas, these geological shelves are shared with other countries which share the corresponding seas. For example, the Chukchi Shelf is shared between Russia and the [[United States]] according to the 1990 [[USA-USSR maritime boundary]].

==2001 extension claim==
On 20 December 2001, [[Russia]] made an official submission into the [[UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] in accordance with the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (article 76, paragraph 8). In the document it is proposed to establish new outer limits of the continental shelf of Russia beyond the previous [[Exclusive Economic Zone|200 nautical mile zone]] (370&amp;nbsp;km), but within the Russian Arctic sector.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/submission_rus.htm|title=Continental Shelf - submission to the Commission by the Russian Federation|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory claimed by Russia in the submission is a large portion of the Arctic within Russia's sector and extending to the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/rus01/RUS_CLCS_01_2001_LOS_2.jpg Area of the continental shelf of the Russian Federation in the Arctic Ocean beyond 200-nautical-mile zone] - borders of the 200 nautical mile (370 km) zone are marked in red, territory claimed by Russia is shaded&lt;/ref&gt; One of the arguments was a statement that eastern portion of the [[Lomonosov Ridge]], an [[mid ocean ridge|underwater mountain ridge]] extending across the polar basin, and the [[Mendeleev Ridge]] are extensions of the [[Eurasian continent]]. In 2002, the UN Commission requested that Russia submit additional scientific evidence in support of its claim.

===Additional research===
{{Main|2007 Russian North Pole expedition}}
Additional research for the Russian claim was planned over 2007&amp;ndash;2008 as part of the Russian program for the [[International Polar Year]]. The program investigated the structure and evolution of the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] in the Arctic regions neighbouring [[Eurasia]], such as the regions of [[Mendeleev Ridge]], [[Alpha Ridge]], and [[Lomonosov Ridge]], to discover whether they were linked with the [[Siberia]]n shelf. Major means of research during the expedition were the ''Akademik Fedorov'' research ship, the ''Russia'' [[Nuclear powered icebreaker|nuclear icebreaker]] with two [[helicopter]]s and geological probe devices, and [[Ilyushin Il-18|Il-18]] aircraft with [[Gravimetry|gravimetric devices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://ipyrus.aari.ru/таблица%20заявок.doc Applications table] at the website of the Russian [[International Polar Year]] program&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LPP[http://www.ipyeaso.aari.ru/images/june_path_update.jpg IPY ACTIVITIES - Russian plans for Arctic Ocean Activities in summer 2007] at [[AARI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, a group of 50 Russian scientists returned from a six-week expedition on the ''Russia'' with the news that the Lomonosov Ridge was linked to [[Russia|Russian Federation]] territory, supporting Russia's claim over the oil-and-gas rich triangle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1642905,00.html Russia Claims the North Pole], [[TIME]], 12 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The territory contained 10 billion tonnes of gas and [[oil]] deposits, the scientists said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,2113289,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront|title=Kremlin lays claim to huge chunk of oil-rich North Pole|author=Luke Harding|work=the Guardian|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian President Vladimir Putin then used this information to restate the 2001 Russian claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=464921&amp;in_page_id=1811|title=Putin's Arctic invasion: Russia lays claim to the North Pole - and all its gas, oil, and diamonds|work=Mail Online|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2007, Russian explorers in a [[submersible]] planted the [[Flag of Russia|national flag]] on the seabed below the North Pole in symbolic support of the 2001 claim. A mechanical arm dropped a specially made [[rust]]-proof [[titanium]] flag onto the Arctic seabed at a depth of {{convert|4261|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name=Reuters070802&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL0286134520070802   Russian sub plants flag under North Pole], ''[[Reuters]]'', published 2007-08-02, accessed 2 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===International response===
In response to [[Russia]]'s planting the [[Flag of Russia|national flag]] on the [[seabed]] at the North Pole, Canadian Foreign Minister [[Peter MacKay]] said, "This isn't the 15th century. You can't go around the world and just plant flags and say 'We're claiming this territory'".    In response to these words the [[Foreign Minister]] of the Russian Federation [[Sergey Lavrov]] stated: "I was amazed by my Canadian counterpart's statement that we are planting flags around. We’re not throwing flags around. We just do what other discoverers did. The purpose of the expedition is not to stake whatever rights of Russia, but to prove that our shelf extends to the North Pole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p792832/Arctic_ocean_bed_causes_upsurge_of_Russia-West_competition/|title=Cold War Goes North - Kommersant Moscow|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research results===
In mid-September 2007, Russia's Natural Resources Ministry issued a statement:
{{cquote|Preliminary results of an analysis of the earth crust model examined by the Arktika 2007 expedition, obtained on September 20, have confirmed that the crust structure of the Lomonosov Ridge corresponds to the world analogues of the continental crust, and it is therefore part of the Russian Federation's adjacent continental shelf.&lt;ref name=Interfax&gt;{{cite news|title=Lomonosov Ridge, Mendeleyev elevation part of Russia's shelf - report |url=http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11861523 |publisher=Interfax Moscow |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2007-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525085551/http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11861523 |archivedate=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On August 4, 2015, Russia submitted additional data in support of its bid, containing new arguments based on "ample scientific data collected in years of Arctic research", for territories in the Arctic to the United Nations. Through this bid, Russia is claiming 1.2 million square kilometers (over 463,000 square miles) of Arctic sea shelf extending more than 350 nautical miles (about 650 kilometers) from the shore.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-to-un-we-are-claiming-463000-square-miles-of-the-arctic-2015-8 Russia to UN: We are claiming 463,000 square miles of the Arctic]". Retrieved 2015-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 09, 2016, Russia formally submitted to the United Nations a revised application with substantiated evidence of shelf claims to the Arctic Ocean seabed, including an area under the North Pole.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/world/europe/russia-to-present-revised-claim-of-arctic-territory-to-the-united-nations.html?_r=2 Russia Presents Revised Claim of Arctic Territory to the United Nations]". The New York Times. Published 2016-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The evidential base of this application includes geology and geophysics evidence from nine Russian scientific expeditions.  They were launched by Ministry of natural resources and environmental protection in cooperation with the Ministry of Defence and Russian Academy of Sciences. It is important to note that the expeditions were performed by scientific icebreakers and submarines. Moreover a geological office has conducted acquisitions of bathymetric multibeam sounder,  integrated seismic exploration, airborne geophysical measurements and geological sampling of the main Amerasian and Eurasian basins’ structures. During the work researchers used a unique technology, specially designed for difficult ice conditions. The icebreaking research vessel "Akademik Fedorov" was refitted specifically for seismic operations in ice thickness up to three meters.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://rg.ru/2016/08/09/donskoj-potencial-shelfa-v-arktike-5-mlrd-tonn-uslovnogo-topliva.html The shelf and plume]". "Russian Newspaper" Published 2016-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The justification of Russian claim is confirmed by the continuity of the sedimentary magnitude, elements of basal complex, as well as the overall continuity and consistency of the deep layers of the earth's crust and the absence of strike-slip transverse faults at the junction of the Lomonosov Ridge and the Eurasian continent.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mnr.gov.ru/news/detail.php?ID=144441 Dialogue on the Russian application is productive]".

All collected data show the continental character of the Lomonosov Ridge, the Mendeleev-Alfa High, the Chukotka Plateau, as well as the continuous extension of these elements from the shallow Eurasian shelf.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://thebarentsobserver.com/arctic/2016/08/arctic-shelf-ours This Arctic shelf is ours]".

On August, 09, 2016, all of this evidence were presented in New York at the 41st session of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS).

A '''corona ring''', also called an '''anti-corona ring''', is a [[Toroid (geometry)|toroid]] of conductive material, usually metal, which is attached to a terminal or other irregular hardware piece of [[high voltage]] equipment.  The role of the corona ring is to distribute the [[electric field gradient]] and lower its maximum values below the corona threshold, either preventing [[corona discharge]] entirely or transferring its destructive effects from the valuable hardware to the expendable ring.  Corona rings are used on very high voltage power transmission insulators and switchgear, and on scientific research apparatus that generates high voltages.  A very similar related device, the '''grading ring''' is used around insulators.

==Corona discharge==
{{main|Corona discharge}}
[[Corona discharge]] is a leakage of electric current into the air adjacent to high voltage conductors.  It is sometimes visible as a dim blue glow in the air next to sharp points on high voltage equipment.  The high [[electric field]] [[ionization|ionizes]] the air, making it conductive, allowing current to leak from the conductor into the air in the form of [[ion]]s.   In electric power transmission lines and equipment, corona results in an economically significant waste of power and may deteriorate the hardware from where it originates.   In devices such as [[electrostatic generator]]s, [[Marx generator]]s, and television sets, the current load caused by corona leakage can reduce the voltage produced by the device, causing it to malfunction.  Coronas also produce noxious and corrosive [[ozone]] gas, which can cause aging and embrittlement of nearby structures such as insulators, and create a health hazard for workers and local residents.   For these reasons corona discharge is considered undesirable in most electrical equipment.

==How they work==
Corona discharges only occur when the [[electric field]] (potential gradient) at the surface of conductors exceeds a critical value, the [[dielectric strength]] or ''disruptive potential gradient'' of air.  It is roughly 30 kilovolts per centimeter, but varies with atmospheric pressure, so corona is more of a problem at high altitudes.  The electric field at a conductor is greatest where the curvature is sharpest, and therefore corona discharge occurs first at sharp points, corners and edges.  The terminals on very high voltage equipment are frequently designed with large diameter rounded shapes such as balls and toruses called ''corona caps'', to suppress corona formation.   However, some parts of high voltage circuits require hardware with exposed sharp edges or corners, such as the attachment points where wires or bus bars are connected to insulators.   Corona rings are installed at these points to prevent corona formation.  

The corona ring is electrically connected to the high voltage conductor, encircling the points where corona would form.  Since the ring is at the same potential as the conductor, the presence of the ring reduces the potential gradient at the surface of the conductor greatly, below the disruptive potential gradient, so corona does not form on the metal points.

==Grading rings==
[[Image:U of Pennsylvania accelerator beam tube 1940.jpg|thumb|Grading rings along a [[linear accelerator]] beam tube at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1940.]]

A very similar related device, called a '''grading ring''', is also used on high-voltage equipment.  Grading rings are similar to corona rings, but they encircle insulators rather than conductors.  Although they may also serve to suppress corona, their main purpose is to reduce the potential gradient along the insulator, preventing premature [[electrical breakdown]].   

The potential gradient (electric field) across an insulator is not uniform, but is highest at the end next to the high voltage electrode.  If subjected to a high enough voltage, the insulator will break down and become conductive at that end first.  Once a section of insulator at the end has electrically broken down and become conductive, the full voltage is applied across the remaining length, so the breakdown will quickly progress from the high voltage end to the other, and a flashover arc will start.    Therefore, insulators can stand significantly higher voltages if the potential gradient at the high voltage end is reduced.  

The grading ring surrounds the end of the insulator next to the high voltage conductor.  It reduces the gradient at the end, resulting in a more even voltage gradient along the insulator, allowing a shorter, cheaper insulator to be used for a given voltage.   Grading rings also reduce aging and deterioration of the insulator that can occur at the high voltage end due to the high electric field there.

In very high voltage apparatus like [[Marx generator]]s and [[particle accelerator]] tubes, insulating columns often have many metal grading rings spaced evenly along their length.  These are linked by a voltage divider chain of high value resistors so there is an equal voltage drop from each ring to the next.  This divides the potential difference evenly along the length of the column so there are no high field spots, resulting in the least stress on the insulators.

==Uses==
Corona rings are used on extremely high voltage apparatus like [[Van de Graaff generator]]s,  [[Cockcroft–Walton generator]]s, and [[particle accelerator]]s, as well as [[electric power transmission]] insulators, bushings and switchgear.  Manufacturers suggest a corona ring on the line end of the insulator for transmission lines above 230&amp;nbsp;kV and on both ends for potentials above 500&amp;nbsp;kV. Corona rings prolong the lifetime of insulator surfaces by suppressing the effects of corona discharge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XMl8OU4wIEQC&amp;pg=SA10-PA11&amp;dq=%22corona+rings%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22corona%20rings%22&amp;f=false Electric power generation, transmission, and distribution, Volume 1] By Leonard L. Grigsby, CRC Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-8493-9292-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corona rings may also be installed on the insulators of [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] of high-power [[radio transmitter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QjYtNJZmWLEC&amp;pg=PA873&amp;dq=%22corona+rings%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22corona%20rings%22&amp;f=false The Handbook of antenna design, Volume 2] By Alan W.

'''Crystallography''' is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids (see [[crystal structure]]). The word "crystallography" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''crystallon'' "cold drop, frozen drop", with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and ''graphein'' "to write".  In July 2012, the [[United Nations]] recognised the importance of the science of crystallography by proclaiming that 2014 would be the International Year of Crystallography.&lt;ref name="UN Resolution"&gt;[http://www.iycr2014.org/about/resolution UN announcement "International Year of Crystallography"]. iycr2014.org. 12 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[X-ray crystallography]] is used to determine the structure of large [[biomolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s. 
Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography (see below), the study of [[crystal]]s was based on physical measurements of their geometry. This involved measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to each other and to theoretical reference axes (crystallographic axes), and establishing the [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] of the crystal in question. This physical measurement is carried out using a [[goniometer]]. The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net such as a [[Wulff net]] or [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection|Lambert net]]. The [[pole figure|pole]] to each face is plotted on the net. Each point is labelled with its [[Miller index]]. The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established.

Crystallographic methods now depend on analysis of the [[diffraction]] patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type. [[X-ray]]s are most commonly used; other beams used include [[electron]]s or [[neutron]]s. This is facilitated by the wave properties of the particles. Crystallographers often explicitly state the type of beam used, as in the terms ''[[X-ray crystallography]], [[neutron diffraction]]'' and ''[[electron diffraction]]''. These three types of radiation interact with the specimen in different ways. 
*X-rays interact with the spatial distribution of [[electron]]s in the sample. 
*Electrons are [[charged particle]]s and therefore interact with the total [[Charge density|charge distribution]] of both the [[atomic nuclei]] and the electrons of the sample. 
*Neutrons are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the [[strong nuclear force]]s, but in addition, the [[magnetic moment]] of neutrons is non-zero. They are therefore also scattered by [[magnetic field]]s. When neutrons are scattered from [[hydrogen]]-containing materials, they produce diffraction patterns with high noise levels. However, the material can sometimes be treated to substitute [[deuterium]] for hydrogen. 
Because of these different forms of interaction, the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies.

==Theory==
{{Condensed matter physics}}
An image of a small object is made using a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to focus the beam, similar to a lens in a microscope. However, the wavelength of visible light (about 4000 to 7000 [[ångström]]) is three [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] longer than the length of typical [[chemical bond|atomic bonds]] and [[atom]]s themselves (about 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;Å). Therefore, obtaining information about the spatial arrangement of atoms requires the use of radiation with shorter wavelengths, such as X-ray or neutron beams. Employing shorter wavelengths implied abandoning microscopy and true imaging, however, because there exists no material from which a lens capable of focusing this type of radiation can be created.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Scientists have had some success focusing X-rays with microscopic [[Fresnel zone plate]]s made from gold, and by critical-angle reflection inside long tapered capillaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Synchrotron Radiation|volume=14|year=2007|pages=326–330|doi=10.1107/S0909049507025174|title=Two-step hard X-ray focusing combining Fresnel zone plate and single-bounce ellipsoidal capillary|author=Snigirev, A. |pmid=17587657|issue=Pt 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diffracted X-ray or neutron beams cannot be focused to produce images, so the sample structure must be reconstructed from the diffraction pattern. Sharp features in the diffraction pattern arise from periodic, repeating structure in the sample, which are often very strong due to coherent reflection of many photons from many regularly spaced instances of similar structure, while non-periodic components of the structure result in diffuse (and usually weak) diffraction features - areas with a higher density and repetition of atom order tend to reflect more light toward one point in space when compared to those areas with fewer atoms and less repetition.

Because of their highly ordered and repetitive structure, crystals give diffraction patterns of sharp [[Bragg reflection]] spots, and are ideal for analyzing the structure of solids.

==Notation==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ion implantation]] --&gt;
{{Main|Miller index}}

*Coordinates in ''square [[bracket]]s'' such as '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[100]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' denote a direction vector (in real space).
*Coordinates in ''angle brackets'' or ''chevrons'' such as '''&amp;lt;100&amp;gt;''' denote a ''family'' of directions which are related by symmetry operations. In the cubic [[crystal system]] for example, '''&lt;100&gt;''' would mean &lt;nowiki&gt;[100], [010], [001]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or the negative of any of those directions.
*Miller indices in ''parentheses'' such as '''(100)''' denote a plane of the crystal structure, and regular repetitions of that plane with a particular spacing. In the cubic system, the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the (hkl) plane is the direction [hkl], but in lower-symmetry cases, the normal to (hkl) is not parallel to [hkl].
*Indices in ''curly brackets'' or ''braces'' such as '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{100}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' denote a family of planes and their normals which are equivalent in cubic materials due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions. In non-cubic materials, &lt;hkl&gt; is not necessarily perpendicular to {hkl}.

==Techniques==
Some materials that have been analyzed crystallographically, such as [[protein]]s, do not occur naturally as crystals. Typically, such molecules are placed in solution and allowed to slowly crystallize through vapor [[diffusion]]. A drop of solution containing the molecule, buffer, and precipitants is sealed in a container with a reservoir containing a [[hygroscopic]] solution. Water in the drop diffuses to the reservoir, slowly increasing the concentration and allowing a crystal to form. If the concentration were to rise more quickly, the molecule would simply [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, resulting in disorderly granules rather than an orderly and hence usable crystal.

Once a crystal is obtained, data can be collected using a beam of radiation. Although many universities that engage in crystallographic research have their own X-ray producing equipment, [[Synchrotron light|synchrotron]]s are often used as X-ray sources, because of the purer and more complete patterns such sources can generate. Synchrotron sources also have a much higher intensity of X-ray beams, so data collection takes a fraction of the time normally necessary at weaker sources. Complementary neutron crystallography techniques are used to identify the positions of hydrogen atoms, since X-rays only interact very weakly with light elements such as hydrogen.

Producing an image from a diffraction pattern requires sophisticated [[mathematics]] and often an iterative process of '''modelling and refinement.''' In this process, the mathematically predicted diffraction patterns of an hypothesized or "model" structure are compared to the actual pattern generated by the crystalline sample. Ideally, researchers make several initial guesses, which through refinement all converge on the same answer. Models are refined until their predicted patterns match to as great a degree as can be achieved without radical revision of the model. This is a painstaking process, made much easier today by computers.

The mathematical methods for the analysis of diffraction data only apply to ''patterns,'' which in turn result only when waves diffract from orderly arrays. Hence crystallography applies for the most part only to crystals, or to molecules which can be coaxed to crystallize for the sake of measurement. In spite of this, a certain amount of molecular information can be deduced from patterns that are generated by fibers and [[powder diffraction|powders]], which while not as perfect as a solid crystal, may exhibit a degree of order. This level of order can be sufficient to deduce the structure of simple molecules, or to determine the coarse features of more complicated molecules. For example, the double-helical structure of [[DNA]] was deduced from an X-ray diffraction pattern that had been generated by a fibrous sample.

==In materials science==
Crystallography is used by materials scientists to characterize different materials. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. In addition, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding [[crystallographic defect]]s. Mostly, materials do not occur as a single crystal, but in poly-crystalline form (i.e., as an aggregate of small crystals with different orientations). Because of this, the [[powder diffraction]] method, which takes diffraction patterns of polycrystalline samples with a large number of crystals, plays an important role in structural determination.

Other physical properties are also linked to crystallography. For example, the minerals in [[clay]] form small, flat, platelike structures. Clay can be easily deformed because the platelike particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates, yet remain strongly connected in the direction perpendicular to the plates. Such mechanisms can be studied by crystallographic [[Texture (crystalline)|texture]] measurements.

In another example, [[iron]] transforms from a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) structure to a [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) structure called [[austenite]] when it is heated. The fcc structure is a close-packed structure unlike the bcc structure; thus the volume of the iron decreases when this transformation occurs.

Crystallography is useful in phase identification. When manufacturing or using a material, it is generally desirable to know what compounds and what phases are present in the material, as their composition, structure and proportions will influence the material's properties. Each phase has a characteristic arrangement of atoms. X-ray or neutron diffraction can be used to identify which patterns are present in the material, and thus which compounds are present. Crystallography covers the enumeration of the symmetry patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal and for this reason is related to group theory and geometry.

==Biology==
[[X-ray crystallography]] is the primary method for determining the molecular conformations of biological [[macromolecule]]s, particularly [[protein]] and [[nucleic acid]]s such as [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. In fact, the double-helical structure of DNA was deduced from crystallographic data. The first crystal structure of a macromolecule was solved in 1958, a three-dimensional model of the myoglobin molecule obtained by X-ray analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/181662a0| title = A Three-Dimensional Model of the Myoglobin Molecule Obtained by X-Ray Analysis| journal = Nature| volume = 181| issue = 4610| pages = 662–6| year = 1958| last1 = Kendrew | first1 = J. C.| last2 = Bodo | first2 = G.| last3 = Dintzis | first3 = H. M.| last4 = Parrish | first4 = R. G.| last5 = Wyckoff | first5 = H.| last6 = Phillips | first6 = D. C. | pmid=13517261|bibcode = 1958Natur.181..662K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) is a freely accessible repository for the structures of proteins and other biological macromolecules. Computer programs such as [[RasMol]] or [[Pymol]] can be used to visualize biological molecular structures.
[[Neutron crystallography]] is often used to help refine structures obtained by X-ray methods or to solve a specific bond; the methods are often viewed as complementary, as X-rays are sensitive to electron positions and scatter most strongly off heavy atoms, while neutrons are sensitive to nucleus positions and scatter strongly even off many light isotopes, including hydrogen and deuterium.
[[Electron crystallography]] has been used to determine some protein structures, most notably [[membrane protein]]s and [[viral capsid]]s.

== Reference literature in crystallography ==
The ''International Tables for Crystallography''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Tables for Crystallography Vol. C: Mathematical, Physical and Chemical Tables|last=Prince|first=E.|publisher=Wiley|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4020-4969-9|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an eight book series that outlines the standard notations for formatting, describing and testing crystals. The series contains books that covers analysis methods and the mathematical procedures for determining organic structure though x-ray crystallography, electron diffraction, and neutron diffraction. The International tables are focused on procedures, techniques and descriptions and does not list the physical properties of individual crystals themselves. Each book is about 1000 pages and the titles of the books are:

:Vol A -  ''Space Group Symmetry'',
:Vol A1 - ''Symmetry Relations Between Space Groups'',
:Vol B -  ''Reciprocal Space'',
:Vol C - ''Mathematical, Physical, and Chemical Tables'',
:Vol D - ''Physical Properties of Crystals'',
:Vol E - ''Subperiodic Groups'',
:Vol F - ''Crystallography of Biological Macromolecues'', and
:Vol G - ''Definition and Exchange of Crystallographic Data''.

'''Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine''' ('''DPPtdCho''') is a [[phospholipid]] (and a [[lecithin]]) consisting of two [[palmitic acid]]s attached of a [[phosphatidylcholine]] head-group and is the major constituent of many [[pulmonary surfactant]]s. It is [[zwitterionic]] by virtue of having a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the [[quaternary ammonium]] group.

It is thought that a lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) acyltransferase may play a critical role in its synthesis. The identity of this acyltransferase has not yet been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Identification and characterization of a lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase in alveolar type II cells | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | year = 2006 | volume = 103 | issue = 31 | pages = 11724–11729 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0604946103 | pmid = 16864775 |last=Chen |first=X | last2 = Hyatt | first2 = BA | last3 = Mucenski | first3 = ML | last4 = Mason | first4 = RJ | last5 = Shannon | first5 = JM | pmc = 1544237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is an exception to the [[rule of thumb]] that biological [[phospholipid]]s are synthesized with a saturated fat at the R1 position and an unsaturated fat at the R2 position.

It is also used for research purposes in studying [[liposome]]s, [[lipid bilayer]]s, and model [[biological membrane]]s and in the formation of reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Estropipate is a [[prodrug]] of [[estrone (medication)|estrone]] and [[estradiol (medication)|estradiol]]. Hence, it is an [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]], or an [[agonist]] of the [[estrogen receptor]]s.

Estropipate has been found to act as an inhibitor of [[SLCO1B1]] (OATP1B1) ([[IC50|IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 70&amp;nbsp;nM).&lt;ref name="FASEBJ"&gt;http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/23/1_MeetingAbstracts/748.2&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Relative oral potencies of estrogens}}

===Pharmacokinetics===
Estropipate is [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] into [[estrone (medication)|estrone]] in the body.&lt;ref name="Martindale" /&gt; Estrone can then be [[biotransformation|transformed]] into [[estradiol (medication)|estradiol]] by [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]].

[[File:Eutectic system phase diagram.svg|thumb|350px|A phase diagram for a fictitious binary chemical mixture (with the two components denoted by ''A'' and ''B'') used to depict the eutectic composition, temperature, and point. (''L'' denotes the liquid state.)]]

A '''eutectic system''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|t|ɛ|k|t|ɪ|k}} {{respell|yoo|TEK|tik}})&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|eutectic}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Greek "ευ" (eu = easy) and "τήξις" (teksis = melting) is a homogeneous mixture of substances that melts or solidifies at a single temperature that is lower than the melting point of either of the constituents.

The separate atomic or chemical species form a joint [[superlattice|super-lattice]], by striking a unique atomic percentage ratio between the components – as each pure component has its own distinct bulk lattice arrangement. It is only in this atomic or molecular ratio that the eutectic system [[melting|melts]] as a whole, at a specific temperature (the eutectic temperature). The super-lattice releases at once all its components into a liquid mixture. The eutectic temperature is the lowest possible melting temperature over all of the mixing ratios for the involved component species.

Upon heating any other mixture ratio, and reaching the eutectic temperature – see the adjacent [[phase diagram]] – one component's lattice will melt first, while the temperature of the mixture has to further increase for (all) the other component lattice(s) to melt.   Conversely, as a non-eutectic mixture cools down, each mixture's component will solidify (form its lattice) at a distinct temperature, until all material is solid.

The coordinates defining a ''eutectic point'' on a [[phase diagram]] are the ''eutectic percentage ratio'' (on the [[Phase diagram|atomic/molecular ratio]] [[Abscissa|axis]] of the diagram) and the ''eutectic temperature'' (on the [[temperature]] [[Ordinate|axis]] of the diagram).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|pp=326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all [[binary alloy]]s have eutectic points because the [[valence electron]]s of the component species are not always compatible,{{clarify|compatible electrons?|date=November 2014}} in any mixing ratio, to form a new type of joint crystal lattice. For example, in the silver-gold system the melt temperature ([[liquidus]]) and freeze temperature ([[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]]) "meet at the pure element endpoints of the atomic ratio axis while slightly separating in the mixture region of this axis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crct.polymtl.ca/fact/phase_diagram.php?file=Ag-Au.jpg&amp;dir=SGTE2007|title=Collection of Phase Diagrams|website=www.crct.polymtl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term {{em|eutectic}} was coined in 1884 by British physicist and chemist [[Frederick Guthrie]] (1833–1886).&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Frederick (1884) "On eutexia", ''Philosophical Magazine'', 5th series, '''17''' :  462–482.  [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015024088166;view=1up;seq=480 From p. 462:]  "The main argument of the present communication hinges upon the existence of compound bodies, whose chief characteristic is the lowness of their temperatures of fusion.  This property of the bodies may be called Eutexia †, the bodies possessing it eutectic bodies or eutectics (''εύ τήκειν'')."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eutectic reaction==
[[File:Various eutectic structures.png|thumb|Four eutectic structures: A) lamellar B) rod-like C) globular D) acicular.]]

The eutectic reaction is defined as follows:&lt;ref name="smith327"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=327}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Liquid} \xrightarrow[\text{cooling}]{\text{eutectic temperature}} \alpha \,\, \text{solid solution} + \beta \,\, \text{solid solution}&lt;/math&gt;

This type of reaction is an [[invariant reaction]], because it is in [[thermal equilibrium]]; another way to define this is the change in [[Gibbs free energy]] equals zero. Tangibly, this means the liquid and two [[solid solution]]s all coexist at the same time and are in [[chemical equilibrium]]. There is also a [[thermal arrest]] for the duration of the change of phase during which the temperature of the system does not change.&lt;ref name="smith327"/&gt;

The resulting solid [[wikt:macrostructure|macrostructure]] from a eutectic reaction depends on a few factors. The most important factor is how the two solid solutions nucleate and grow. The most common structure is a [[lamellar structure]], but other possible structures include rodlike, globular, and [[Acicular (crystal habit)|acicular]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|pp=332–333}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-eutectic compositions==
Compositions of eutectic systems that are not at the eutectic composition can be classified as ''hypoeutectic'' or ''hypereutectic''. Hypoeutectic compositions are those with a smaller percent composition of species β and a greater composition of species α than the eutectic composition (E) while hypereutectic solutions are characterized as those with a higher composition of species β and a lower composition of species α than the eutectic composition. As the temperature of a non-eutectic composition is lowered the liquid mixture will precipitate one component of the mixture before the other.  In a hypereutectic solution, there will be a proeutectoid phase of species β whereas a hypoeutectic solution will have a proeutectic α phase.&lt;ref name="smith327"/&gt;

==Types==

===Alloys===
Eutectic [[alloy]]s have two or more materials and have a eutectic composition. When a non-eutectic alloy solidifies, its components solidify at different temperatures, exhibiting a plastic melting range. Conversely, when a well-mixed, eutectic alloy melts, it does so at a single, sharp temperature. The various phase transformations that occur during the solidification of a particular alloy composition can be understood by drawing a vertical line from the liquid phase to the solid phase on the phase diagram for that alloy.

Some uses include:

== Other critical points==

===Eutectoid===
[[File:Steel pd.svg|thumb|right|300px|Iron-carbon phase diagram, showing the eutectoid transformation between austenite (γ) and pearlite.]]

When the solution above the transformation point is solid, rather than liquid, an analogous eutectoid transformation can occur.  For instance, in the iron-carbon system, the [[austenite]] phase can undergo a eutectoid transformation to produce [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] and [[cementite]], often in lamellar structures such as [[pearlite]] and [[bainite]].  This eutectoid point occurs at {{convert|727|C|abbr=on}} and about 0.76% carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/96ClassProj/examples/kimcon.html|title=Iron-Iron Carbide Phase Diagram Example&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216023642/http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/96ClassProj/examples/kimcon.html|archivedate=2008-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peritectoid===
A ''peritectoid'' transformation is a type of [[isothermal]] [[reversible reaction]] that has two solid [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s reacting with each other upon cooling of a binary, ternary, ..., &lt;math&gt;n\!&lt;/math&gt;ary [[alloy]] to create a completely different and single solid phase.&lt;ref name="Gold Book PAC,1994,66,588"&gt;IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology, Electronic version. [http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04501.html "Peritectoid Reaction"] Retrieved May 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reaction plays a key role in the order and [[decomposition]] of [[quasicrystalline]] phases in several alloy types.&lt;ref&gt;Numerical Model of Peritectoid Transformation. [http://doc.tms.org/ezMerchant/prodtms.nsf/ProductLookupItemID/MMTA-9910-2563/$FILE/MMTA-9910-2563F.pdf?OpenElement Peritectoid Transformation] Retrieved May 22, 2007.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928024906/http://doc.tms.org/ezMerchant/prodtms.nsf/ProductLookupItemID/MMTA-9910-2563/$FILE/MMTA-9910-2563F.pdf?OpenElement |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peritectic===
Peritectic transformations are also similar to eutectic reactions. Here, a liquid and solid phase of fixed proportions react at a fixed temperature to yield a single solid phase. Since the solid product forms at the interface between the two reactants, it can form a diffusion barrier and generally causes such reactions to proceed much more slowly than eutectic or eutectoid transformations. Because of this, when a peritectic composition solidifies it does not show the [[lamellar structure]] that is found with eutectic solidification.

Such a transformation exists in the iron-carbon system, as seen near the upper-left corner of the figure.  It resembles an inverted eutectic, with the δ phase combining with the liquid to produce pure [[austenite]] at {{convert|1495|C|abbr=on}} and 0.17% carbon.

[[File:Phasendiagramm Gold-Aluminium.svg|right|300px|thumb|Gold-aluminium [[phase diagram]] (German). Top axis title reads "Weight-percent Gold", lower axis title reads "Atomic-percent Gold"]]
At the peritectic decomposition temperature the compound, rather than melting, decomposes into another solid compound and a liquid. The proportion of each is determined by the [[lever rule]]. In the [[Gold-aluminium intermetallic|Al-Au]] phase diagram, for example, it can be seen that only two of the phases melt congruently, [[Gold-aluminium intermetallic|AuAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Gold-aluminium intermetallic|Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al]] , while the rest peritectically decompose.

==Eutectic calculation==
The composition and temperature of a eutectic can be calculated from enthalpy and entropy of fusion of each components.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Modern Physics C, Vol. 15, No. 5. (2004), pp. 675-687&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gibbs free energy, G, depends
on its own differential

&lt;math&gt;
G = H - TS \Rightarrow {\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
 H = G + TS \\
 \\
{\left( {\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}} \right)_P = - S}
\end{array}
 \right.}
 \Rightarrow H = G - T\left( {\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}}
\right)_P .
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the G/T derivative at constant pressure is calculated by
the following equation

&lt;math&gt;
    \left( {\frac{\partial G / T}{\partial T}} \right)_P
    =
    \frac{1}{T}\left( {\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}} \right)_P - \frac{1}{T^{2}}G
    =
    - \frac{1}{T^{2}}\left( {G - T\left({\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}} \right)_P
    } \right)
    = - \frac{H}{T^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The chemical potential &lt;math&gt;\mu _{i}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated  if we assume the activity is equal to the
concentration.

&lt;math&gt;
\mu _i = \mu _i^\circ + RT\ln \frac{a_i}{a} \approx \mu _i^\circ +
RT\ln x_i
&lt;/math&gt;

At the equilibrium, &lt;math&gt;\mu_i =0&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;\mu_i^\circ&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by:

&lt;math&gt;
\mu _i = \mu _i^\circ + RT\ln x_i = 0 \Rightarrow \mu _i^\circ = -
RT\ln x_i.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using and integrating  gives

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
 \left( {\frac{\partial \mu _i / T}{\partial T}} \right)_P = \frac{\partial
}{\partial T}\left( {R\ln x_i } \right) \Rightarrow R\ln x_i = -
\frac{H_i
^\circ }{T} + K \\
 \\
 \end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The integration constant K may be determined for a pure
component with a melting temperature &lt;math&gt;T^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and an enthalpy of
fusion &lt;math&gt;H^\circ&lt;/math&gt; Eq.

&lt;math&gt;
x_i = 1 \Rightarrow T = T_i^\circ \Rightarrow K = \frac{H_i^\circ
}{T_i^\circ }
&lt;/math&gt;

We obtain a relation  that determines
the molar fraction as a function of the temperature for each
component.

&lt;math&gt;
R\ln x_i = - \frac{H_i ^\circ }{T} + \frac{H_i^\circ }{T_i^\circ }
&lt;/math&gt;

The mixture of n components is described by the system

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{l}
 \left\{ {{\begin{array}{*{20}c}
 {\ln x_i + \frac{H_i ^\circ }{RT} - \frac{H_i^\circ }{RT_i^\circ } =
0} \\
 {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i = 1} } \\
\end{array} }} \right. \\
 \\
 \end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{l}
 \left\{ {{\begin{array}{*{20}c}
 {\forall i &lt; n \Rightarrow \ln x_i + \frac{H_i ^\circ }{RT} -
\frac{H_i^\circ }{RT_i^\circ } = 0} \\
 {\ln \left( {1 - \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n - 1} {x_i } } \right) +
 \frac{H_n
^\circ }{RT} - \frac{H_n^\circ }{RT_n^\circ } = 0} \\
\end{array} }} \right. \\
 \\
 \end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Five Canyons Open Space''' (FCOS) is located in [[Castro Valley, California|Castro Valley]], in [[Alameda County, California]]. Five Canyons is a multi-agency collaboration between East Bay Regional Parks District (EBRPD), Alameda County Public Works, Hayward Area Recreation and Parks District (HARD), and several homeowners associations. EBRPD is the lead agency for this open space. FCOS opened in 1998, consists of {{convert|300|acres|km2}} and {{convert|5|miles|km}} of trails and has almost no amenities. The main visitors are hikers, bicyclists, equestrians and dog walkers. Restrooms and drinking water are available at HARD's nearby Five Canyons Park.&lt;ref name= "EBRPD FCOS Map"&gt;[http://www.ebparks.org/Assets/_Nav_Categories/Parks/Maps/Five+Canyons+text.pdf "Five Canyons Open Space and Trail System (Map text)." East Bay Regional Parks District.] Accessed August 24, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

FCOS is open daily from 8:00 AM until dusk. There are no fees for parking or for dogs. There are no wheelchair-accessible facilities, no restrooms, no drinking water, no picnic facilities, and no reservable campgrounds.&lt;ref name="EBRPD-5Canyons"&gt;[http://www.ebparks.org/parks/five_canyons "Five Canyons Open Space."

{{Refimprove|date=March 2008}}

The '''four-minute warning''' was a public alert system conceived by the [[Politics of the United Kingdom#Government|British Government]] during the [[Cold War]] and operated between 1953 and 1992. The name derived from the approximate length of time from the point at which a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[nuclear missile]] attack against the United Kingdom could be confirmed and the impact of those missiles on their targets. The population was to be notified by means of [[Civil defense siren|air raid sirens]], [[television]] and [[radio]], and urged to seek cover immediately. In practice, the warning would have been more likely three minutes or less.

== The warning system ==

=== Basic details ===
The warning would be initiated by the detection of inbound [[missile]]s and aircraft targeted at the United Kingdom. Early in the [[Cold War]], [[Jodrell Bank]] was used to detect and track incoming missiles, while continuing to be used for astronomical research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article3253887.ece Jodrell Bank article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Cold War, there was a conflict between the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[Home Office]] about who was in charge of the warning system. This was not for any practical or technical reason, but more to do with who would be blamed if a false alarm were given or if an attack occurred without warning (which could have been as little as thirty seconds from launch to impact on a target). By the 1980s, the warning was to be given on the orders of a Warning Officer from the [[United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation|Home Office's Warning and Monitoring Organization]] stationed at [[RAF High Wycombe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/features/sfs/file_16.htm Conflicts over the political fallout explained], subbrit.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 1960s, initial detection of attack would be provided primarily by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[BMEWS]] station at [[RAF Fylingdales|Fylingdales]] in [[North Yorkshire]]. There, powerful [[radar]]s would track the inbound missiles and allow confirmation of targets. In later years the first indication of any imminent attack would be expected to come from [[infrared]] detectors aboard the United States [[Defense Support Program]] (DSP) satellites. BMEWS would still play an important role in tracking and confirming the destination of any launches.

The British government was not the main beneficiary of BMEWS, given that it would only receive what [[Solly Zuckerman]] described in 1960 as "no more than 5 minutes warning time" of an attack. The United States was the United Kingdom's most important military and technological partner, and its [[Strategic Air Command]] would have thirty minutes warning from the Fylingdales station.&lt;ref name="baylis1995"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ambiguity and Deterrence: British Nuclear Strategy 1945–1964 | publisher=Clarendon Press | author=Baylis, John | pages=348 | year=1995 | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-828012-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UKWMO and the ROC ===
{{Main|United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation|Royal Observer Corps}}
[[File:Wb1401warning receiver ptreehse.jpg|thumb|right|WB1401 warning receiver]]
It was the responsibility of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO) at the United Kingdom Regional Air Operations Centre (UK RAOC) located at Headquarters Bomber Command, renamed ''[[RAF Strike Command|Strike Command]] Operations Centre'' in 1968, at High Wycombe to alert the nation to an imminent air attack. Once an alert was initiated the national and local [[television]] and [[radio]] networks would break into transmissions and broadcast a warning (the warning message would originate from an emergency studio in [[BBC]] [[Broadcasting House]] in London). Simultaneously the national [[air raid siren]] system would be brought into service. A system, which used the same frequency on normal telephone lines as the  peacetime [[speaking clock]], was employed for this whereby a key switch activation alerted 250 national Carrier Control Points or CCPs present in [[police station]]s across the country. In turn the CCPs would, via a signal carried along ordinary phone lines, cause 7,000 powered sirens to start up. In rural areas, around 11,000 hand powered sirens would be operated by [[postmaster]]s, rural police officers, or Royal Observer Corps personnel (even parish priests, publicans, magistrates, subpostmasters or private citizens could be involved in some remote rural areas).

Linked into the system were the twenty-five Royal Observer Corps (ROC) group controls, also with direct links to the carrier control points. In the event of subsequent radioactive fallout, local fallout warnings could be generated from the group controls on a very localised basis over the same carrier wave system.

The national warning system saw many changes over the years. During the 1960s and 1970s, much of the local authority [[civil defence]] planning in the United Kingdom became outdated, although the WB400/WB600 warning system was maintained and kept serviceable along with updating of ROC instrumentation and communications. The system's main problem was that many of the telephone lines it needed had to be manually switched in times of pre-war tension by Post Office telephone engineers. The links were not hardened against the effects of [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]. In the late 1970s and early 1980s heightened fears and tensions led to a resumption of contingency planning and the upgrading of many systems. The outdated WB400/WB600 systems were replaced with brand new WB1400 equipment, communications links were made permanent and hardened against EMP disruption.

=== Sirens ===
The national siren system originating from [[World War II]] had a secondary role of "general warning", particularly for imminent flooding. Following the end of the [[Cold War]], a telephone-based system was thought to be more appropriate for national warnings and less expensive to maintain. Additionally the Government retains an ability to break into television and radio broadcasts for the purpose of alerting the general public and has legal power to take over editorial control of the [[BBC]] during a national emergency under the [[BBC Charter]] and the [[Broadcasting Act 1980]].

The national siren system was largely dismantled during the 1990s. The British Government cited the increasing use of [[Insulated glazing|double-glazed windows]] (which make sirens harder to hear) and the reduced likelihood of air attack as reasons to eliminate the system in most parts of the country. Some coastal and river areas have retained and regularly test the sirens as part of the flood warning defences. Since 1952, [[Broadmoor Hospital]] has employed [[Broadmoor Sirens|a network of 14 sirens]] to warn of escaped patients; this is tested every Monday at 10 am. The hospital sirens are scheduled for removal during 2018 except for one located in the hospital grounds. [[State Hospital|Carstairs Hospital]] also retains its sirens, which are tested monthly. In some towns sirens were once used to summon part-time firemen until the introduction of radio pagers during the 1970s – these 'stand alone' sirens operated independently of the warning network.

== Sample script ==
The following is a script that would have been broadcast in the event of an attack, available from the BBC. It was recorded by [[Peter Donaldson]], chief continuity announcer for [[BBC Radio 4]]:

{{Quotation|''
This is the [[Wartime Broadcasting Service]]. This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons. Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you further information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own house.
&lt;br&gt;
Remember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourself to greater danger.&lt;br&gt;
If you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and without protection. Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open. Roofs and walls offer substantial protection. The safest place is indoors. Make sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished. If mains water is available, this can be used for fire-fighting. You should also refill all your containers for drinking water after the fires have been put out, because the mains water supply may not be available for very long.
&lt;br&gt;
Water must not be used for flushing lavatories: until you are told that lavatories may be used again, other toilet arrangements must be made. Use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. Water means life. Don't waste it.
&lt;br&gt;
Make your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for 14 days or more. If you have fresh food in the house, use this first to avoid wasting it: food in tins will keep.
&lt;br&gt;
If you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given, stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out. When the immediate danger has passed the sirens will sound a steady note. The "all clear" message will also be given on this wavelength. If you leave the fall-out room to go to the lavatory or replenish food or water supplies, do not remain outside the room for a minute longer than is necessary.
&lt;br&gt;
Do not, in any circumstances, go outside the house. Radioactive fall-out can kill. You cannot see it or feel it, but it is there. If you go outside, you will bring danger to your family and you may die. Stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out or you hear the "all clear" on the sirens.
&lt;br&gt;
Here are the main points again: Stay in your own homes, and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given stay in your fall-out room, until you are told it is safe to come out. The message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength. Make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished. Water must be rationed, and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. It must not be used for flushing lavatories. Ration your food supply—it may have to last for 14 days or more.
&lt;br&gt;
We shall be on the air every hour, on the hour. Stay tuned to this wavelength, but switch your radios off now to save your batteries. That is the end of this broadcast.
''}}

== Cultural impact ==
The [[Cold War]] and the fear of nuclear attack permeated pop culture up until the 1990s. Examples include the song "Four Minute Warning" by the British punk band [[Chaos UK]] (EP "Burning Britain", 1982), the poem "Your Attention Please" by [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]], a solo [[Four Minute Warning (song)|song]] by [[Take That]] singer, [[Mark Owen]], and "Four Minutes" by [[Roger Waters]] (of [[Pink Floyd]] fame) on his 1987 solo album ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]''.  [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] has a song entitled "4-Minute Warning" on the 1988 [[Brian Eno]] album ''[[Music for Films III]]''. The first single of the UK rap crew [[Gunshot (band)|Gunshot]], from 1990, was entitled "Battle Creek Brawl (4 Minute Warning)". A [[Radiohead]] track from the 2007 Bonus Disc album [[In Rainbows#Bonus disc|''In Rainbows'' Disk 2]] is titled "4 Minute Warning".

The four-minute warning was a central plot and narrative device in dramas (both on stage and screen) and novels, often being the motor force of plays, films, novels and cartoon strips. The BBC drama ''[[Threads]]'', about how society decays after a nuclear holocaust, focuses on an attack on [[Sheffield]]. ''[[The War Game]]'' also portrays the four-minute warning, pointing out the warning period could be even less. The narrator, [[Michael Aspel]], says it could even be two minutes between issuing the warning and impact on a target. The [[When the Wind Blows (1986 film)|film adaptation]] of [[Raymond Briggs]]'s [[satirical]] and [[black comedy|blackly comic]] [[cartoon strip]], ''[[When the Wind Blows (graphic novel)|When the Wind Blows]]'', has the warning message as part of the script, which triggers arguing between Jim and Hilda Bloggs. Although this is not [[Peter Donaldson]]'s pre-recorded warning (which was not available on grounds of national security and for copyright reasons), this was a fictional announcement written on grounds of [[artistic licence]]. It was read by [[Robin Houston]], a voiceover artist who was known in London as a newsreader for [[Thames Television]] (who played the role of newsreader in the film).

The adult humour comic ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' ran a photo strip in its issue 107 called "Four Minutes to Fall in Love", where a boyfriend and girlfriend cram a whole relationship into the four minutes before a nuclear attack. The four-minute warning had become the inspiration for many jokes and sketches in comedy programmes in Britain, in the same way that the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] had in the United States (see [[nuclear weapons in popular culture]]). In one episode of ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', "[[The Russians Are Coming]]," [[Delboy]] and [[Rodney Trotter]] sell [[fallout shelter]] kits and have an attack drill. Driving towards their shelter, they are stopped by the police for speeding and asked: "You just heard the four-minute warning?" After being sent on their way, Rodney points out: "We died forty-five seconds ago." Around the same time, a sketch on the [[BBC Scotland]] programme ''[[Naked Video]]'' had a mock announcement warning of an attack with a [[Punch line|punchline]] of "...[[Regional variation|except for viewers in Scotland]]."

'''Golen Gol Hydropower Plant (GGHPP)''' is a [[hydroelectric]] power plant located on Golen Gol River - a major left tributary of [[Mastuj River]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nation.com.pk/business/01-Oct-2011/Wapda-gears-up-work-on-hydropower-projects&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wapda.gov.pk/vision2025/htmls_vision2025/gghp.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chitral District]] of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2010/12/28/business/wapda-inks-hydroelectric-agreement/&lt;/ref&gt; The dam is located approximately 25&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chitral]] city, and 365&amp;nbsp;km from provincial capital of [[Peshawar]]. Construction of Golen Gol project began in 2011, and was completed in January 2018.

==Construction and background==
Golen Gol Hydropower Project is a [[run-of-the-river]] project designed for the generation of 108 MW consisting of three vertical [[Pelton wheel]] turbine units in one phase with average energy output of 436 Gwh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.devex.com/projects/tenders/golen-gol-hydropower-project-in-pakistan/48966&lt;/ref&gt; Golen Gol Hydropower Project is a part of least-cost energy generation plan, being executed by [[WAPDA]] to harness the indigenous hydropower resources of the country. [[WAPDA]] awarded the contract to SAMBU-SARCO joint venture comprising a Korean and a Pakistani firm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Rs.7.52b+agreement+signed+for+106-MW+Golen+Gol+Project.-a0245328034&lt;/ref&gt; Sambu, an independent power provider (IPP), won the project in the last quarter of 2010 and construction work started in Jan 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brecorder.com/agriculture-a-allied/183/1237094/?tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default&amp;page=&lt;/ref&gt;

Sambu has already successfully completed Pakistan's first IPP hydropower plant, 84MW [[New Bong Escape Hydropower Project]], which is commercially operational since March 2013. Korean company has also been awarded a contract to construct Pakistan's third IPP hydropower plant, 100MW [[Gulpur Hydropower Project]] on BOOT (Build, Own, Operate, Transfer) basis Joint Venture with other Korean firm and execution of work is in progress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brecorder.com/agriculture-a-allied/183/1237094/?tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;layout=default&amp;page=&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi Fund for Development is the major source of funding for the 108-MW Golen Gol hydropower project being developed by [[Pakistan]]'s [[WAPDA]]. The Golen Gol project is also being funded by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFD) and [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2013/11/saudi-fund-increases-financing-for-pakistan-s-golen-gol-hydropower-plant.html&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Fund, Kuwait Fund and Opec Fund are providing $107 million for the construction of GGHPP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nation.com.pk/business/01-Oct-2011/Wapda-gears-up-work-on-hydropower-projects&lt;/ref&gt;

The Electro-Mechanical works of the Golen Gol Project were awarded to Andritz Hydro,the world leader and renowned supplier of hydro power equipment and services. The Project is based on the state of the art, water to wire concept developed by Andritz Hydro for the supply, installation and commissioning of the hydro power plants. Andritz hydro completed the similar projects namely Allai Khwar and Duber Khwar in North of Pakistan within the record lowest time period and thus providing timely and precious power supply to the country and considerable early revenue generation to WAPDA.

==Major benefits and uses==
On its completion, Golen Gol Hydropower project will generate about 436 Mega Units (GWH) of inexpensive electricity annually to earn revenue of about Rs 1 billion. Being an environment friendly hydropower project, it will help reduce dependence on expensive thermal power, thereby saving foreign exchange amounting to $34 million (equivalent to Rs 3 billion) to the country. According to estimation, Golen Gol hydropower project will add about Rs 9 billion per annum to the national economy through socio-economic uplift in the country caused by the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nation.com.pk/business/01-Oct-2011/Wapda-gears-up-work-on-hydropower-projects&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of Golen Gol Hydropower Plant was commenced in June 2009 and the project is expected to be completed in October 2017. The total cost of the project is about PKR 16 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pes.net.pk/Gol%20Hydropower.html&lt;/ref&gt; Golen Gol Hydropower Project is part of the least-cost energy generation plan of the [[Government of Pakistan]]. It is being executed by Wapda on priority basis to harness indigenous hydropower resources to improve the ratio of hydel electricity in the national grid and help provide relief to the consumers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1057328/57m-saudi-fund-for-golen-gol-power-project&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heavy fermion superconductors''' are a type of [[unconventional superconductor]].

The first [[heavy fermion]] superconductor, CeCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, was discovered by [[Frank Steglich]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="Steglich1979"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.43.1892|title=Superconductivity in the Presence of Strong Pauli Paramagnetism: CeCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|year=1979|last1=Steglich|first1=F.|first2=J.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=43|issue=25|pages=1892–1896|last2=Aarts|last3=Bredl|first3=C.D.|last4=Lieke|first4=W.|last5=Meschede|first5=D.|last6=Franz|first6=W.|last7=Schäfer|first7=H.|bibcode=1979PhRvL..43.1892S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then over 30 heavy fermion superconductors were found (in materials based on Ce, U), with a critical temperature up to 2.3 K (in CeCoIn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Petrovic2001"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/13/17/103|title=Heavy-fermion superconductivity in CeCoIn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; at 2.3 K|year=2001|last1=Petrovic|first1=C.|last2=Pagliuso|first2=P.G.|last3=Hundley|first3=M.F.|last4=Movshovich|first4=R.|last5=Sarrao|first5=J.L.|last6=Thompson|first6=J.D.|last7=Fisk|first7=Z.|last8=Monthoux|first8=P.| journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter| volume=13|issue=17|pages=L337|arxiv = cond-mat/0103168 |bibcode = 2001JPCM...13L.337P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy Fermions are intermetallic compounds, containing rare earth or actinide elements. The f-electrons of these atoms hybridize with the normal conduction electrons leading to quasiparticles with an enhanced mass.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

From specific heat measurements (ΔC/C(T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) one knows that the [[Cooper pair]]s in the superconducting state are also formed by the heavy quasiparticles.&lt;ref&gt;Neil W. Ashcroft and N. David Mermin, Solid State Physics&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to normal superconductors it cannot be described by BCS-Theory. Due to the large effective mass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.1551|title=Superconducting phases of f -electron compounds|year=2009|last1=Pfleiderer|first1=C.|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=81|issue=4|pages=1551–1624|bibcode=2009RvMP...81.1551P|arxiv = 0905.2625 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 
Fermi velocity is reduced and comparable to the inverse Debye frequency. This leads to the failing of the picture of electrons polarizing the lattice as an attractive force.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Some heavy fermion superconductors are candidate materials for the [[Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase|Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J. Phys.

'''Hypersonic flight''' is [[flight]] through the [[atmosphere]] below about 90km at [[Hypersonic speed|speeds above Mach 5]], a speed where [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of air begins to become significant and high heat loads exist.

==History==
The first manufactured object to achieve hypersonic flight was the two-stage [[RTV-G-4 Bumper|Bumper]] rocket, consisting of a [[WAC Corporal]] second stage set on top of a [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] first stage. On February 1949, at [[White Sands V-2 Launching Site|White Sands]], the rocket reached a speed of 5,150 miles per hour, or approximately Mach 6.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/missile-surface-surface-v-2-4 |first=Frank|last=Winter|title=V-2 missile|publisher=airandspace.si.edu|date=2000-08-03|website=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle, however, burned on [[atmospheric re-entry]], and only charred remnants were found. In April 1961, Russian Major [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to travel at hypersonic speed, during the world's first piloted [[orbital flight]]. Soon after, in May 1961, [[Alan Shepard]] became the first American and second person to achieve hypersonic flight when his capsule reentered the atmosphere at a speed above Mach 5 at the end of his [[suborbital flight]] over the Atlantic Ocean. 

In November, 1961, Air Force Major [[Robert Michael White|Robert White]] flew the [[X-15]] research airplane at speeds over Mach 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Robert|title=Across the Hypersonic Divide|url=http://www.historynet.com/across-the-hypersonic-divide.htm|website=HistoryNet|publisher=HistoryNet LLC|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/22/2852999.htm?section=justin |title=Hypersonic plane passes latest test - Just In - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Hypersonic weapons development==

'''Jiroft Dam '''is a [[hydroelectric dam]] in Iran with an installed electricity generating capability of 85 MWh situated in [[Kerman Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.iwpco.ir/default.aspx |title=Home - Iran Water and Power Resources Development Co |publisher=En.iwpco.ir |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fifth concrete dam built in the country, it was begun in 1975 and completed in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jiroft-i-geography-of-jiroft-sub-province |title=JIROFT i.

It is located on [[Halil River]] ([[Halilrood]]) 40&amp;nbsp;km upstream of [[Jiroft]] (North-East of the city) in the narrow valley of Narab.
Its reservoir capacity is around 410 million cubic metres up to the normal level (1185 metres above sea level). The maximum height of the dam is 134 m and the crest length is 277 m. The dam in its first water year of operation (1992) survived an extraordinary flood (1 February 1993) with the peak discharge of 5035 cubic metres per second. The flood had a return period of 800 to 1000 years.&lt;ref name="my msc thesis"&gt;Abdolreza Bahremand, 1997, MSc thesis, Flood routing through the Jiroft Dam reservoir, Tehran University, Iran.&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy rains of this year caused the dam was filled of water much sooner than the planned water storing duration. The spillways and other hydrodynamic outlets of the dam can manage to discharge up to 6500 cubic meters per seconds (the design flood with return period of 10000 years).
The reservoir is planned to irrigate 14200 hectares of the downstream lands.&lt;ref name="my msc thesis" /&gt;

"Captain" John Hance was said to be one of the Grand Canyon's most colorful characters, and it had been declared by one early visitor that "To see the canyon only and not to see Captain John Hance, is to miss half the show." Hance delighted in telling canyon stories to visitors, favoring the whopper of a tale over mere facts.  With a straight face, Hance told travelers how he had dug the canyon himself, piling the excavated earth down near [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] (a dirt pile now known as the [[San Francisco Peaks]]).  Despite such questionable claims, Hance left a lasting legacy at the Grand Canyon, dying in 1919, the year the Grand Canyon became a National Park.  Hance was the first person buried in what would become the Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery.

There are many historic streets that are cobbled. In the United States, several of these are recognized in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List==
The following is a list of streets and roads which are famed or notable for being paved with [[cobblestone|cobbles]] (natural stone), [[sett (paving)|setts]] (cut stone), artificial [[Paver (flooring)|pavers]] (i.e. concrete or brick), or similar masonry works (natural, cut, or artificial).

A '''marine thruster''' is a device for producing directed [[hydrodynamic thrust]] on a marine [[vehicle]]. The thrust direction may be fixed or steerable.
Examples of marine thrusters include [[screw propeller]]s, [[Voith-Schneider propellers]], [[Pump-jet|waterjets]], [[ducted propeller]]s, tunnel [[bow thrusters]] and stern thrusters, [[azimuth thrusters]], [[rim-driven thruster]]s, [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] and [[submersible]] drive units.
Marine thrusters may be used for [[propulsion]], [[Maneuver (ship control)|maneuvering]] and [[Steering#Watercraft steering|steering]], [[Attitude control (submersibles)|attitude control]] and [[dynamic positioning]].

==Structure==
A naturally occurring [[polymer]], it is composed of [[glucose]] units connected by a 1-4 beta glycosidic bond. These linear cellulose chains are bundled together as [[microfibril]] spiralled together in the walls of [[plant cell]]. 

Each microfibril exhibits a high degree of three-dimensional internal bonding resulting in a crystalline structure that is insoluble in water and resistant to reagents. There are, however, relatively weak segments of the microfibril with weaker internal bonding. These are called amorphous regions; some argue that they are more accurately called dislocations, because of the single-phase structure of microfibrils. The crystalline region is isolated to produce microcrystalline cellulose.

==Uses==
Approved within the European Union as a thickener, stabilizer or emulsifiers microcrystalline cellulose was granted the [[E number]] E460(i) with basic cellulose given the number E460.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco_foods/main/index.cfm|title=FOODS|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MCC has use in [[cosmetics]] as an [[abrasive]], [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]], anti-caking agent, aqueous [[viscosity]] increasing agent, binder, bulking agent, emulsion stabilizer, slip modifier, and texturizer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Decorative skin and hair cosmetics containing microcrystalline cellulose as enhancing agent|date=2004-01-06|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20040156811A1/en|accessdate=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/microcrystalline-cellulose|title=Microcrystalline Cellulose {{!}} Cosmetics Info|website=www.cosmeticsinfo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be found in various hair and skin care products as well as [[makeup]].

The MCC is a valuable additive in pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic and other industries. Different properties of MCC are measured to qualify its suitability to such utilization, namely particle size, density, compressibility index, angle of repose, powder porosity, hydration swelling capacity, moisture sorption capacity, moisture content, crystallinity index, crystallite size, and mechanical properties such as hardness and tensile strength.

==Synthesis==
MCC is pure partially depolymerized cellulose synthesized from α-cellulose precursor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biocrystals.net/|title=Hindi, S. S. Z. 2016. Microcrystalline cellulose: Its specifications and pharmaceutical processing. Biocrystals Journal. 1 (1): 26-38.|website=BioCrystals|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MCC can be synthesized by different processes such as reactive extrusion, enzyme mediated, steam explosion and acid hydrolysis. The later process can be done using mineral acids such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, HCl and HBr as well as ionic liquids. The role of these reagents is to destroy the amorphous regions leaving the crystalline domains. 

The degree of polymerization is typically less than 400. The MCC particles with size lower than 5&amp;nbsp;µm must not be more than 10%. 

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are also important to predict the thermal behavior of the MCC upon heat stresses.

==Allergic reactions==
At least one case of an allergic reaction to microcrystalline cellulose has been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dynertia.net/mcc_allergy_redacted.png|title=Letter from Allergy Clinic of Tulsa|access-date=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:LAnumbering.png|375px|thumb|The [[chemical structure]] of [[linoleic acid]], a common omega-6 fatty acid found in many [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[seeds]] and [[vegetable oil]]s.]]
'''Omega-6 fatty acids''' (also referred to as '''ω-6 fatty acids''' or '''''n''-6 fatty acids''') are a family of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] that have in common a final carbon-carbon [[double bond#Bond order|double bond]] in the [[Fatty acid#Nomenclature|''n''-6]] position, that is, the sixth bond, counting from the methyl end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chow |first=Ching Kuang |oclc=25508943 |title=Fatty Acids in Foods and Their Health Implications |publisher=Routledge Publishing |location=New York |year=2001}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the family can have pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20354260| title = Anti-inflammatory pro-resolving derivatives of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids| journal = Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online)| volume = 64| pages = 115–32| year = 2010| last1 = JZ| first1 = Nowak}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The biological effects of the omega-6 fatty acids are largely produced during and after physical activity for the purpose of promoting growth and during the inflammatory cascade to halt cell damage and promote cell repair by their conversion to omega-6 [[eicosanoid]]s that bind to diverse receptors found in every tissue of the body.

==Biochemistry==
[[Linoleic acid]] (18:2, ''n''−6), the shortest-chained omega-6 fatty acid, is one of many [[essential fatty acid]]s and is categorized as an essential fatty acid because the human body cannot synthesize it. Mammalian cells lack the enzyme [[omega-3 desaturase]] and therefore cannot convert omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids. Closely related omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids act as competing substrates for the same enzymes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This outlines the importance of the proportion of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in a diet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Bibus|first1 = Doug|last2 = Lands|first2 = Bill|title = Balancing proportions of competing omega-3 and omega-6 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in tissue lipids|doi = 10.1016/j.plefa.2015.04.005|date = April 18, 2015|pmid = 26002802|volume=99|journal=Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids|pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omega-6 fatty acids are precursors to [[endocannabinoids]], [[lipoxins]], and specific [[eicosanoid]]s.

Medical research on humans found a correlation (though [[correlation does not imply causation]]) between the high intake of omega-6 fatty acids from vegetable oils and disease in humans. However, biochemistry research has concluded that [[air pollution]], [[heavy metals]], [[smoking]], [[passive smoking]], [[lipopolysaccharides]], [[lipid peroxidation]] products (found mainly in vegetable oils, roasted nuts and roasted oily seeds) and other exogenous toxins initiate the inflammatory response in the cells which leads to the expression of the [[COX-2]] enzyme and subsequently to the temporary production of inflammatory ''promoting'' [[prostaglandins]] from [[arachidonic acid]] for the purpose of alerting the immune system of the [[cell damage]] and eventually to the production of anti-inflammatory molecules (e.g. [[lipoxins]] &amp; [[prostacyclin]]) during the resolution phase of inflammation, after the cell damage has been repaired.''&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins and inflammation"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.207449 |title=Prostaglandins and inflammation. |year=2011 |last1=Ricciotti |first1=Emanuela |last2=FitzGerald, |first2=Garret A. |journal=American Heart Association Journal |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=986–1000 |pmid=21508345 |pmc=3081099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yutong Zhao"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1165/rcmb.2008-0105OC |title=Regulation of COX-2 Expression and IL-6 Release by Particulate Matter in Airway Epithelial Cells |year=2009 |last1=Zhao |first1=Yutong |last2=Usatyuk |first2=Peter V. |last3=Gorshkova |first3=Irina A. |last4=He |first4=Donghong |last5=Wang |first5=Ting |last6=Moreno-Vinasco |first6=Liliana |last7=Geyh |first7=Alison S. |last8=Breysse |first8=Patrick N. |last9=Samet |first9=Jonathan M. |last10=Spannhake |first10=Ernst Wm. |last11=Garcia |first11=Joe G.N. |last12=Natarajan |first12=Viswanathan |journal=American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology |volume=40 |pages=19–30 |pmid=18617679 |issue=1 |display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calderón-Garcidueñas L"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01926230490520232 |title=Brain Inflammation and Alzheimer's-Like Pathology in Individuals Exposed to Severe Air Pollution |year=2004 |last1=Calderón-Garcidueñas |first1=Lilian |last2=Reed |first2=William |last3=Maronpot |first3=Robert |last4=Henriquez-Roldán |first4=Carlos |last5=Delgado-Chavez |first5=Ricardo |last6=Carlos Henriquez-Roldán |first6=Ana |last7=Dragustinovis |first7=Irma |last8=Franco-Lira |first8=Maricela |last9=Aragón-Flores |first9=Mariana |last10=Solt |first10=Anna |last11=Altenburg |first11=Michael |last12=Torres-Jardón |first12=Ricardo |last13=Swenberg |first13=James |journal=Toxicologic Pathology |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=650–58 |pmid=15513908 |display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimitrios Moraitis"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Dimitrios |last1=Moraitis |first2=Baoheng |last2=Du |first3=Mariana S. |last3=De Lorenzo |first4=Jay O. |last4=Boyle |first5=Babette B. |last5=Weksler |first6=Erik G. |last6=Cohen |first7=John F. |last7=Carew |first8=Nasser K. |last8=Altorki |first9=Levy |last10=Subbaramaiah |first10=K |last11=Dannenberg |first11=A.J. |last9=Kopelovich |title=Levels of Cyclooxygenase-2 Are Increased in the Oral Mucosa of Smokers: Evidence for the Role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and Its Ligands |journal=Cancer Research |pmid=15695412 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15695412 |year=2005 |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=664–70 |display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang CM"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajplung.00151.2009 |title=Cigarette smoke extract induces COX-2 expression via a PKCα/c-Src/EGFR, PDGFR/PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway and p300 in tracheal smooth muscle cells |year=2009 |last1=Yang |first1=Chuen-Mao |last2=Lee |first2=I-Ta |last3=Lin |first3=Chih-Chung |last4=Yang |first4=Ya-Lin |last5=Luo |first5=Shue-Fen |last6=Kou |first6=Yu Ru |last7=Hsiao |first7=Li-Der |journal=American Journal of Physiology.

==Pharmacology==
The conversion of cell membrane [[arachidonic acid]] (20:4n-6) to omega-6 [[prostaglandin]] and omega-6 [[leukotriene]] eicosanoids during the inflammatory cascade provides many targets for pharmaceutical drugs to impede the inflammatory process in [[atherosclerosis]],&lt;ref name="simopoulos2002" /&gt; [[asthma]], [[arthritis]], [[vascular disease]], [[thrombosis]], immune-inflammatory processes, and tumor proliferation. Competitive interactions with the [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s affect the relative storage, mobilization, conversion and action of the omega-3 and omega-6 eicosanoid precursors (see [[Essential fatty acid interactions]]).

==Suggested negative health effects==

Excess omega-6 fatty acids from vegetable oils interfere with the health benefits of omega-3 fats, in part because they compete for the same rate-limiting enzymes. A high proportion of omega-6 to omega-3 fat in the diet shifts the physiological state in the tissues toward the pathogenesis of many diseases: prothrombotic, proinflammatory and proconstrictive.&lt;ref name="simopoulos2003"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1159/000073788 |chapter=Importance of the Ratio of Omega-6/Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids: Evolutionary Aspects |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0PWAie_YIkC&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Omega-6/Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acid Ratio: The Scientific Evidence |series=World Review of Nutrition and Dietetics |year=2003 |last1=Simopoulos |first1=A.P. |isbn=3-8055-7640-4 |volume=92 |pages=1–22 |pmid=14579680 |editor1-last=Simopoulos |editor1-first=Artemis P. |editor2-last=Cleland |editor2-first=Leslie G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Omega-6 consumption==

Industry-sponsored studies have suggested that omega-6 fatty acids should be consumed in a 1:1 ratio to omega-3,&lt;ref name="nutrasource.ca"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simopoulos|first1=A.P|title=Evolutionary aspects of diet, the omega-6/omega-3 ratio and genetic variation: nutritional implications for chronic diseases|journal=Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy|date=28 July 2006|volume=60|issue=9|pages=502–07|url=http://www.nutrasource.ca/files/omega_3_chronic_nov2006.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2015|doi=10.1016/j.biopha.2006.07.080}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it has been observed that the diet of many individuals today is at a ratio of about 16:1, mainly from vegetable oils.&lt;ref name="nutrasource.ca"/&gt; Omega-6 and omega-3 are essential fatty acids that are metabolized by some of the same [[enzymes]], and therefore an imbalanced ratio can affect how the other is metabolized.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doyle|first1=Cynthia|last2=Abbott|first2=Amber|last3=Doyle|first3=Patrick|last4=Nader|first4=Glenn|last5=Larson|first5=Stephanie|title=A review of fatty acid profiles and antioxidant content in grass-fed and grain-fed beef|journal=Nutrition Journal|volume=9|issue=1|page=10|pmc=2846864|doi=10.1186/1475-2891-9-10|year=2010|pmid=20219103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study performed by Ponnampalam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ponnampalam|first1=Eric|last2=Mann|first2=Neil|last3=Sinclair|first3=Andrew|title=Effect of feeding systems on omega-3 fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acid and trans fatty acids in Australian beef cuts: potential impact on human health|journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr|date=2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=21–29|url=http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/APJCN/15/1/21.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2015|pmid=16500874}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was noticed that feeding systems had a great effect on nutrient content on the meat sold to consumers. Cynthia Doyle conducted an experiment to observe the fatty acid content of beef raised through grass feeding versus grain feeding; she concluded that grass fed animals contain an overall omega-6:omega-3 ratio that is preferred by nutritionists.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; In today's modern agriculture, the main focus is on production quantity, which has decreased the omega-3 content, and increased the omega-6 content, due to simple changes such as grain-feeding cattle.&lt;ref name="simopoulos2002" /&gt;   In grain-feeding cattle, this is a way to increase their weight and prepare them for slaughter much quicker compared to grass-feeding. This modern way of feeding animals may be one of many indications as to why the omega-6:omega-3 ratio has increased.

The melting point of the fatty acids increase as the number of carbons in the chain increases.

==Dietary linoleic acid requirement==
Adding more controversy to the omega-6 fat issue is that the dietary requirement for linoleic acid  has been questioned, because of a significant methodology error proposed by [[University of Toronto]] scientist [[Stephen Cunnane]].&lt;ref name=" Cunnane2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0163-7827(03)00038-9 |title=Problems with essential fatty acids: Time for a new paradigm? |year=2003 |last1=Cunnane |first1=Stephen C. |journal=Progress in Lipid Research |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=544–68 |pmid=14559071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunnane proposed that the seminal research used to determine the dietary requirement for linoleic acid was based on feeding animals linoleic acid-deficient diets, which were simultaneously deficient in omega-3 fats. The omega-3 deficiency was not taken into account. The omega-6 oils added back systematically to correct the deficiency also contained trace amounts of omega-3 fats. Therefore, the researchers were inadvertently correcting the omega-3 deficiency as well.  Ultimately, it took more oil to correct both deficiencies. According to Cunnane, this error overestimates linoleic acid requirements by 5 to 15 times.{{update inline|date=February 2018}}

In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the level of effort ([[Level of Effort|LOE]]) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being utilized. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of [[maximum sustainable yield]].

In [[environmental science]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield, and enables an ecosystem to have a high aesthetic value. This concept is widely used specifically in the management of fisheries, where surplus fish are removed so the population stays at its [[carrying capacity]]. This allows the most fish to be harvested while still maintaining maximum population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=M.N.|title=Maximum Sustainable Yield|journal=Encyclopedia of Ecology|date=2008|pages=2292–2296|doi=10.1016/B978-008045405-4.00522-X|url=https://www.mysciencework.com/publication/show/c2ed3587ad108c20dbd37c125c0be159|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''piezoelectric microelectromechanical system (piezoMEMS)''' is a miniature or microscopic device that uses [[piezoelectricity]] to generate motion and carry out its tasks. It is a [[Microelectromechanical systems|microelectromechanical system]] that takes advantage of an [[Electric potential|electrical potential]] that appears under [[mechanical stress]]. PiezoMEMS can be found in a variety of applications, such as [[switch]]es, [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printer heads]], sensors, [[micropump]]s, and energy harvesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azosensors.com/news.aspx?newsID=12130|title=High-Speed Switching Enhances Piezoelectric Response in piezoMEMS Devices|last=|first=|date=August 30, 2017|work=AZoSensors|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in piezoMEMS technology began around the early 1990s as scientists explored alternatives to electrostatic actuation in [[Radio frequency microelectromechanical system|radio frequency (RF) microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/piezomems/about-piezomems/pzt/|title=PZT|last=|first=|date=April 22, 2010|website=SINTEF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For RF MEMS, electrostatic actuation specialized high voltage charge pump circuits due to small electrode gap spacing and large driving voltages.

In 2017, researchers from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]] evaluated the [[radiation]] effects in the piezoelectric response of PZT thin films for the first time. They determined that PZT exhibited a degree of [[radiation hardness]] that could be further extended by using conductive oxide electrodes instead of traditional platinum electrodes. [[Gamma Radiation|Gamma radiation]] tests have also shown that actuated devices such as switches, [[resonator]]s, and inertial devices could benefit from the [[radiation tolerance]] of PZT, suggesting the possibility that actuators and sensors can be integrated into platforms evaluating [[nuclear material]] and reduce human exposure to radiation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acq.osd.mil/chieftechnologist/scientist/2017-4thQtr.html|title=Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Scientist Honored as the Department of Defense (DoD) Laboratory Scientist of the Quarter|last=|first=|date=|work=Department of Defense Research &amp; Engineering Enterprise|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brewer|first=Steven|last2=Cress|first2=Cory|last3=Williams|first3=Samuel|last4=Zhou|first4=Hanhan|last5=Rivas|first5=Manuel|last6=Polcawich|first6=Ronald|last7=Glaser|first7=Evan|last8=Jones|first8=Jacob|last9=Bassiri-Gharb|first9=Nazanin|date=July 13, 2017|title=Phenomenological Model for Defect Interactions in Irradiated Functional Materials|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=7|issue=1|pages=5308|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-05071-z|pmid=28706227|pmc=5509665|bibcode=2017NatSR...7.5308B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
There exists three primary approaches to realizing PiezoMEMS devices:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadigadapa|first=Srinivas|date=September 2010|title=Piezoelectric microelectromechanical systems — challenges and opportunities|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705810006958|journal=Procedia Engineering|volume=5|pages=468–471|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''The additive approach:''' The piezoelectric thin films are deposited on [[silicon]] substrates with layers of insulating and conducting material followed by surface or silicon [[bulk micromachining]].
# '''The subtractive approach:''' Single crystal or [[polycrystalline]] piezoelectrics and piezoceramics are subjected to direct bulk micromachining and then electroded.
# '''The integrative approach:''' Micromachined structures are integrated in silicon or piezoelectrics by using bonding techniques on bulk piezoelectric or silicon substrates.

PiezoMEMS use two principal crystal structures, the [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] and [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite]] structures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
PiezoMEMS still face many difficulties that impede its ability to be successfully commercialized. For instance, the success of depositing uniform films of piezoelectrics still depend heavily on the use of appropriate layers of proper [[nucleation]] and film growth. As a result, extensive device-specific development efforts are needed to create a proper sensor structure. In addition, researchers continue to search for ways to reduce and control the material and sensor drift and aging characteristics of thin film piezoelectric materials. Deposition techniques to create thin films with properties approaching those of bulk materials remain in development and in need of improvement. Furthermore, the chemistry and etching characteristics of most piezoelectric materials remain very slow.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Platinum''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Pt''' and [[atomic number]] 78. It is a [[density|dense]], [[malleability|malleable]], [[ductility|ductile]], highly unreactive, [[precious metal|precious]], silverish-white [[transition metal]]. Its name is derived from the Spanish term ''platino'', meaning "little silver".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/464081/platinum-Pt "platinum (Pt)."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405132703/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/464081/platinum-Pt |date=5 April 2012 }} Encyclopædia Britannica Online.

Platinum is a member of the [[platinum group]] of elements and [[group 10 element|group 10]] of the [[periodic table of elements]]. It has six naturally occurring [[isotopes]]. It is one of the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|rarer elements in Earth's crust]], with an average abundance of approximately 5&amp;nbsp;[[microgram|μg]]/kg. It occurs in some [[nickel]] and [[copper]] ores along with some [[Native element mineral|native]] deposits, mostly in [[South Africa]], which accounts for 80% of the world production. Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, only a few hundred [[tonne]]s are produced annually, and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major [[List of traded commodities#Precious metals|precious metal commodity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-platinum-price/currency-shocks-knock-platinum-to-10-year-lows-idUKKBN1L219X|title=Currency shocks knock platinum to 10-year lows|last=Hobson|first=Peter|date=|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinum is one of the [[Reactivity series|least reactive metals]]. It has remarkable resistance to [[corrosion]], even at high temperatures, and is therefore considered a [[noble metal]]. Consequently, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. Because it occurs naturally in the [[alluvium|alluvial sands]] of various rivers, it was first used by [[pre-Columbian]] South American natives to produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early as 16th century, but it was not until [[Antonio de Ulloa]] published a report on a new metal of [[Colombia]]n origin in 1748 that it began to be investigated by scientists.

Platinum is used in [[catalytic converter]]s, laboratory equipment, [[electric]]al contacts and [[electrode]]s, [[platinum resistance thermometer]]s, [[dentistry]] equipment, and jewelry. Being a [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]], it leads to health problems upon exposure to its [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]; but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/123081/AQG2ndEd_6_11Platinum.PDF|title=Air Quality Guidelines|edition=Second|chapter=Chapter 6.11 Platinum|publisher=WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark|date=2000|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018173735/http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/123081/AQG2ndEd_6_11Platinum.PDF|archivedate=18 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounds containing platinum, such as [[cisplatin]], [[oxaliplatin]] and [[carboplatin]], are applied in [[chemotherapy]] against certain types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  pmid = 20593091 |  date = 2010 |  last1 = Wheate |  first1 = N.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===
Pure platinum is a lustrous, [[Ductility|ductile]], and [[malleable]], silver-white metal.&lt;ref name="lagowski"&gt;{{cite book |title = Chemistry Foundations and Applications|volume = 3 |editor = Lagowski, J.

Platinum does oxidize, forming PtO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at 500&amp;nbsp;°C; this oxide can be easily removed thermally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.technology.matthey.com/pdf/pmr-v8-i2-050-054.pdf J. C. Chaston, Platinum Metals Rev. 8, 50 (1964).]&lt;/ref&gt; It reacts vigorously with fluorine at {{convert|500|C}} to form [[platinum tetrafluoride]].&lt;ref name="Lockyer1891"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Norman Lockyer|title=Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FswKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA625|year=1891|publisher=Macmillan Journals Limited|pages=625–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324091844/https://books.google.com/books?id=FswKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA625|archivedate=24 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also attacked by [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and [[sulfur]].

The most common [[oxidation state]]s of platinum are +2 and +4. The +1 and +3 oxidation states are less common, and are often stabilized by metal bonding in bimetallic (or polymetallic) species. As is expected, tetracoordinate platinum(II) compounds tend to adopt 16-electron [[square planar]] geometries. Although elemental platinum is generally unreactive, it dissolves in hot [[aqua regia]] to give aqueous [[chloroplatinic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;):&lt;ref name="Kauuf" /&gt;
: Pt + 4 HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

As a [[HSAB theory|soft acid]], platinum has a great affinity for sulfur, such as on [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO); numerous DMSO complexes have been reported and care should be taken in the choice of reaction solvent.&lt;ref name=han&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/om700543p|title = Mono- vs Bis(carbene) Complexes: A Detailed Study on Platinum(II)−Benzimidazolin-2-ylidenes|date = 2007|first1 = Y. |last1 = Han |first2=H.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of platinum}}
Platinum has six naturally occurring [[isotopes]]: &lt;sup&gt;190&lt;/sup&gt;Pt, &lt;sup&gt;192&lt;/sup&gt;Pt, &lt;sup&gt;194&lt;/sup&gt;Pt, &lt;sup&gt;195&lt;/sup&gt;Pt, &lt;sup&gt;196&lt;/sup&gt;Pt, and &lt;sup&gt;198&lt;/sup&gt;Pt. The most [[isotopic abundance|abundant]] of these is &lt;sup&gt;195&lt;/sup&gt;Pt, comprising 33.83% of all platinum. It is the only stable isotope with a non-zero spin; with a spin of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;195&lt;/sup&gt;Pt satellite peaks are often observed in &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P NMR spectroscopy (i.e., Pt-phosphine and Pt-alkyl complexes). &lt;sup&gt;190&lt;/sup&gt;Pt is the least abundant at only 0.01%. Of the naturally occurring isotopes, only &lt;sup&gt;190&lt;/sup&gt;Pt is unstable, though it decays with a half-life of 6.5{{e|11}}&amp;nbsp;years, causing an activity of 15 [[Becquerel|Bq]]/kg of natural platinum. &lt;sup&gt;198&lt;/sup&gt;Pt can undergo [[alpha decay]], but its decay has never been observed (the [[half-life]] is known to be longer than 3.2{{e|14}}&amp;nbsp;years); therefore, it is considered stable. Platinum also has 31 synthetic isotopes ranging in atomic mass from 166 to 202, making the total number of known isotopes 37. The least stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;166&lt;/sup&gt;Pt, with a half-life of 300&amp;nbsp;µs, whereas the most stable is &lt;sup&gt;193&lt;/sup&gt;Pt with a half-life of 50&amp;nbsp;years. Most platinum isotopes decay by some combination of [[beta decay]] and alpha decay. &lt;sup&gt;188&lt;/sup&gt;Pt, &lt;sup&gt;191&lt;/sup&gt;Pt, and &lt;sup&gt;193&lt;/sup&gt;Pt decay primarily by [[electron capture]]. &lt;sup&gt;190&lt;/sup&gt;Pt and &lt;sup&gt;198&lt;/sup&gt;Pt are predicted to have energetically favorable [[double beta decay]] paths.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Audi| first = G.| title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| issue = 1| pages = 3–128| date = 2003| doi = 10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode = 2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

Platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and as [[alloy]] with the other platinum-group metals and [[iron]] mostly. Most often the native platinum is found in secondary deposits in [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits. The alluvial deposits used by [[pre-Columbian]] people in the [[Chocó Department]], [[Colombia]] are still a source for platinum-group metals. Another large alluvial deposit is in the [[Ural Mountains]], Russia, and it is still mined.&lt;ref name="CRC"/&gt;

In [[nickel]] and [[copper]] deposits, platinum-group metals occur as [[sulfide]]s (e.g. (Pt,Pd)S), [[telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]] (e.g. PtBiTe), [[antimonide]]s (PdSb), and [[arsenide]]s (e.g. PtAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and as end alloys with nickel or copper. Platinum arsenide, [[sperrylite]] (PtAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is a major source of platinum associated with nickel ores in the [[Sudbury Basin]] deposit in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. At [[Platinum, Alaska]], about {{convert|17000|kg|ozt|abbr=on}} was mined between 1927 and 1975. The mine ceased operations in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Platinum exists in higher abundances on the [[Moon]] and in meteorites.

==Compounds==

===Halides===
Hexachloroplatinic acid mentioned above is probably the most important platinum compound, as it serves as the precursor for many other platinum compounds. By itself, it has various applications in photography, zinc etchings, [[Indelible ink#Indelible ink|indelible ink]], plating, mirrors, porcelain coloring, and as a catalyst.&lt;ref name="krebs"&gt;{{cite book|title = The History and Use of our Earth's Chemical Elements|author = Krebs, Robert E.|chapter = Platinum|pages = 124–127|publisher = Greenwood Press|date = 1998|isbn = 978-0-313-30123-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of hexachloroplatinic acid with an ammonium salt, such as [[ammonium chloride]], gives [[ammonium hexachloroplatinate]],&lt;ref name=Kauuf&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ammonium Hexachloroplatinate(IV)|first = George B.|last = Kauffman|authorlink = George B.

When hexachloroplatinic acid is heated, it decomposes through [[platinum(IV) chloride]] and [[platinum(II) chloride]] to elemental platinum, although the reactions do not occur stepwise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = A.

All three reactions are reversible. [[Platinum(II) bromide|Platinum(II)]] and [[platinum(IV) bromide]]s are known as well. [[Platinum hexafluoride]] is a strong oxidizer capable of [[dioxygenyl#Synthesis|oxidizing oxygen]].

===Oxides===
[[Platinum(IV) oxide]], PtO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as '[[Adams' catalyst]]', is a black powder that is soluble in [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solutions and concentrated acids.&lt;ref name="perry"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Handbook of Inorganic Compounds |journal=Nature|volume=177|issue=4510|last=Perry|first=D.

==History==

===Early uses===
Archaeologists have discovered traces of platinum in the gold used in ancient Egyptian burials as early as 1200 BC. However, the extent of early Egyptians' knowledge of the metal is unclear. It is quite possible they did not recognize there was platinum in their gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jewelrymaking Through History: An Encyclopedia |pages=155–156 |author=Rayner W. Hesse |date=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-33507-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metal was used by [[pre-Columbian]] Americans near modern-day [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador]] to produce artifacts of a white gold-platinum alloy. Archeologists usually associate the tradition of platinum-working in South America with the [[Pre-Columbian_Ecuador#La_Tolita_Culture|La Tolita Culture]] (circa 600 BC - AD 200), but precise dates and location is difficult, as most platinum artifacts from the area were bought secondhand through the [[antiquities trade]] rather than by direct archeological excavation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Platinum metals review|author=David A.

The platinum used in such objects was not the pure element, but rather a naturally occurring mixture of the [[platinum group]] metals, with small amounts of palladium, rhodium, and iridium.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Platinum and its Allied Metals|pages=7–8|author=Donald McDonald, Leslie B. Hunt|date=1982|publisher=Johnson Matthey Plc|isbn=978-0-905118-83-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European discovery===
The first European reference to platinum appears in 1557 in the writings of the [[Italy|Italian]] humanist [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] as a description of an unknown noble metal found between [[Darién Province|Darién]] and Mexico, "which no fire nor any Spanish artifice has yet been able to liquefy".&lt;ref name="weeks"&gt;{{cite book| title = Discovery of the Elements|pages = 385–407|author = Weeks, M. E.|date= 1968|edition = 7th|publisher = Journal of Chemical Education| isbn = 978-0-8486-8579-9| oclc = 23991202}}&lt;/ref&gt; From their first encounters with platinum, the Spanish generally saw the metal as a kind of impurity in gold, and it was treated as such. It was often simply thrown away, and there was an official decree forbidding the [[adulteration]] of gold with platinum impurities.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

[[File:Almirante Antonio de Ulloa.jpg|thumb|[[Antonio de Ulloa]] is credited in European history with the discovery of platinum.]]

In 1735, [[Antonio de Ulloa]] and Don Jorge Juan y Santacilia saw Native Americans mining platinum while the Spaniards were travelling through Colombia and Peru for eight years. Ulloa and Juan found mines with the whitish metal nuggets and took them home to Spain. Antonio de Ulloa returned to Spain and established the first mineralogy lab in Spain and was the first to systematically study platinum, which was in 1748. His historical account of the expedition included a description of platinum as being neither separable nor [[calcination|calcinable]]. Ulloa also anticipated the discovery of platinum mines. After publishing the report in 1748, Ulloa did not continue to investigate the new metal. In 1758, he was sent to superintend mercury mining operations in [[Huancavelica]].&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt;

In 1752, [[Henrik Teofilus Scheffer|Henrik Scheffer]] published a detailed scientific description of the metal, which he referred to as "white gold", including an account of how he succeeded in fusing platinum ore with the aid of [[arsenic]]. Scheffer described platinum as being less pliable than gold, but with similar resistance to corrosion.&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt;

===Means of malleability===
[[Carl von Sickingen]] researched platinum extensively in 1772. He succeeded in making [[malleable]] platinum by [[alloy]]ing it with gold, dissolving the alloy in hot ''[[aqua regia]]'', precipitating the platinum with [[ammonium chloride]], igniting the ammonium chloroplatinate, and hammering the resulting finely divided platinum to make it cohere. [[Franz Karl Achard]] made the first platinum crucible in 1784. He worked with the platinum by fusing it with arsenic, then later [[volatilisation|volatilizing]] the arsenic.&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt;

Because the other platinum-family members were not discovered yet (platinum was the first in the list), Scheffer and Sickingen made the false assumption that due to its hardness—which is slightly more than for pure [[iron]]—platinum would be a relatively non-pliable material, even brittle at times, when in fact its ductility and malleability are close to that of gold. Their assumptions could not be avoided because the platinum they experimented with was highly contaminated with minute amounts of platinum-family elements such as [[osmium]] and [[iridium]], amongst others, which embrittled the platinum alloy. Alloying this impure platinum residue called "plyoxen" with gold was the only solution at the time to obtain a pliable compound, but nowadays, very pure platinum is available and extremely long wires can be drawn from pure platinum, very easily, due to its crystalline structure, which is similar to that of many soft metals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/platinum.htm Platinum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222044410/http://mysite.du.edu/%7Ejcalvert/phys/platinum.htm |date=22 December 2011 }}. mysite.du.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1786, [[Charles III of Spain]] provided a library and laboratory to [[Pierre-François Chabaneau]] to aid in his research of platinum. Chabaneau succeeded in removing various impurities from the ore, including gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron. This led him to believe he was working with a single metal, but in truth the ore still contained the yet-undiscovered platinum-group metals. This led to inconsistent results in his experiments. At times, the platinum seemed malleable, but when it was alloyed with iridium, it would be much more [[brittle]]. Sometimes the metal was entirely incombustible, but when alloyed with osmium, it would volatilize. After several months, Chabaneau succeeded in producing 23&amp;nbsp;kilograms of pure, malleable platinum by hammering and compressing the sponge form while white-hot. Chabeneau realized the infusibility of platinum would lend value to objects made of it, and so started a business with Joaquín Cabezas producing platinum ingots and utensils. This started what is known as the "platinum age" in Spain.&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt;

Platinum, along with the rest of the [[Platinum group|platinum-group metals]], is obtained commercially as a by-product from [[nickel]] and [[copper]] mining and processing. During [[Copper extraction techniques#Electrorefining|electrorefining of copper]], noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum-group metals as well as [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] settle to the bottom of the cell as "anode mud", which forms the starting point for the extraction of the platinum-group metals.&lt;ref name="usgs2010-yearbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/platinum/myb1-2010-plati.pdf |author=Loferski, P.

If pure platinum is found in [[placer deposits]] or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], whereas nickel and iron are both [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in either of the two acids and recovering the remaining platinum.&lt;ref name="heiserman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Exploring Chemical Elements and their Compounds|last = Heiserman |first= David L.|pages = 272–274|publisher = TAB Books|isbn = 978-0-8306-3018-9|date = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One suitable method for purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, and the other platinum-group metals, is to process it with ''aqua regia'', in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated by the addition of [[iron(II) chloride]] and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as [[Ammonium hexachloroplatinate|ammonium chloroplatinate]] by the addition of [[ammonium chloride]]. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = L. B.|last1 = Hunt|last2 = Lever|first2 = F.

===Catalyst===
The most common use of platinum is as a [[catalyst]] in chemical reactions, often as [[platinum black]]. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a [[catalytic converter]], which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst in a number of separate processes, but especially in [[catalytic reforming]] of straight-run [[Petroleum naphtha|naphthas]] into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as [[Adams' catalyst]], is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for [[vegetable oil]]s.&lt;ref name="krebs" /&gt; Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of [[hydrogen peroxide]] into [[water]] and oxygen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Chemistry: Principles &amp; Modern Applications|author = Petrucci, Ralph H.|edition=9th|page = 606|publisher = Prentice Hall|date = 2007|isbn=978-0-13-149330-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is used in [[fuel cell]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fuel Cell System Explained|first1=James|last1=Laramie|first2=Andrew|last2=Dicks|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.|year=2003|isbn=978-0-470-84857-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a catalyst for the reduction of [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A general approach to the size- and shape-controlled synthesis of platinum nanoparticles and their catalytic reduction of oxygen|first1=C.|last1=Wang|first2=H.|last2=Daimon|first3=T.|last3=Onodera|first4=T.|last4=Koda|first5=S.|last5=Sun|doi=10.1002/anie.200800073|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=47|issue=19|pages=3588–3591|year=2008|pmid=18399516|bibcode=2012AnChe..51.3695M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard===
[[File:Platinum-Iridium meter bar.jpg|thumb|right|Prototype International Meter bar]]
From 1889 to 1960, the [[metre|meter]] was defined as the length of a platinum-iridium (90:10) alloy bar, known as the [[International Prototype Meter]] bar. The previous bar was made of platinum in 1799. Until 2018, the [[International Prototype Kilogram]] remained defined by a cylinder of the same platinum-iridium alloy made in 1879.&lt;ref name="meter"&gt;{{cite book|doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-00738-5_4|chapter = Chapter 4.

{{main|Platinum as an investment|Platinum coin}}
Platinum is a [[precious metal]] [[commodity]]; its [[bullion]] has the [[ISO currency code]] of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewellery, usually as a 90–95% alloy, due to its inertness. It is used for this purpose for its prestige and inherent bullion value. Jewellery trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches (which they term [[patina]]) as a desirable feature in attempt to enhance value of platinum products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.professionaljeweler.com/archives/articles/2004/aug04/0804fys.html|title = Professional Jeweler's Magazine Archives, issue of August 2004|accessdate = 19 June 2011|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928115918/http://www.professionaljeweler.com/archives/articles/2004/aug04/0804fys.html|archivedate = 28 September 2011|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.diamondcuttersintl.com/a-platinum-primer|title = Platinum primer|publisher = Diamond Cutters International|accessdate = 18 June 2011|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045943/http://www.diamondcuttersintl.com/a-platinum-primer/|archivedate = 27 September 2011|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[watchmaking]], [[Vacheron Constantin]], [[Patek Philippe]], [[Rolex]], [[Breitling SA|Breitling]], and other companies use platinum for producing their limited edition watch series. Watchmakers appreciate the unique properties of platinum, as it neither tarnishes nor wears out (the latter quality relative to gold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://watches.infoniac.com/index.php?page=post&amp;id=44|title = Unknown Facts about Platinum|publisher = watches.infoniac.com|accessdate = 9 September 2008|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080921210250/http://watches.infoniac.com/index.php?page=post&amp;id=44|archivedate = 21 September 2008|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of platinum, like other industrial commodities, is more volatile than that of gold. In 2008, the price of platinum dropped from $2,252 to $774 per oz,&lt;ref name="Kitco Pt 2008 prices"&gt;{{cite web |title=One Year Platinum |publisher=Kitco |url=http://www.kitco.com/LFgif/pt2008.gif |accessdate=28 June 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928050643/http://www.kitco.com/LFgif/pt2008.gif |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a loss of nearly 2/3 of its value. By contrast, the price of gold dropped from ~$1,000 to ~$700/oz during the same time frame, a loss of only 1/3 of its value.

During periods of sustained economic stability and growth, the price of platinum tends to be as much as twice the price of gold, whereas during periods of economic uncertainty,&lt;ref name="TheSpeculativeInvestor"&gt;{{cite web|title = Platinum versus Gold|publisher = The Speculative Invertor|url = http://www.speculative-investor.com/new/article150402.html|date = 14 April 2002|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081026073657/http://www.speculative-investor.com/new/article150402.html|archivedate = 26 October 2008|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the price of platinum tends to decrease due to reduced industrial demand, falling below the price of gold. Gold prices are more stable in slow economic times, as gold is considered a safe haven.  Although gold is used in industrial applications, its demand is not so driven by industrial uses. In the 18th century, platinum's rarity made King [[Louis XV of France]] declare it the only metal fit for a king.&lt;ref name="mineralszone"&gt;{{cite web |title=Platinum |publisher=Minerals Zone |url=http://www.mineralszone.com/minerals/platinum.html |accessdate=9 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012110510/http://www.mineralszone.com/minerals/platinum.html |archivedate=12 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
In the laboratory, platinum wire is used for electrodes; platinum pans and supports are used in [[thermogravimetric analysis]] because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000&amp;nbsp;°C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent [[magnet]]s.&lt;ref name="krebs"/&gt; Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.&lt;ref name="CRC"/&gt;

As platinum is a [[catalyst]] in the manufacture of the [[silicone rubber]] and gel components of several types of [[implant (medicine)|medical implants]] (breast implants, joint replacement prosthetics, artificial lumbar discs, vascular access ports, etc.), the possibility that platinum could enter the body and cause adverse effects has merited study.

'''Polyresin''' is a [[resin]] compound generally used for [[statue]]s, [[figurine]]s, [[bobblehead]]s and decorative [[furniture]]. It is a sturdy material that can be intricately molded, allowing a great level of detail with consistent texture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-polyresin.htm What is Polyresin?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.polystore.de Polystore about Polyresin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additives can be incorporated into the compound to enhance the material's strength, reduce its weight, add heat stability, decorative effects, and so on. Polyresin is also compatible with a large range of different finishes, including paint and metallic finishes, which is why many decorative pieces are made from this material.

One form of polyresin often used is [[Alabastrite]].  It is a stone-based material, easy to sculpt, takes paint well, and has a similar appearance to porcelain and pottery.

'''Polysulfides''' are a class of [[chemical compound]]s containing chains of [[sulfur]] atoms. There are two main classes of polysulfides: anions and organic polysulfides. [[Anion]]s have the general formula {{chem|S|''n''|2−}}. These anions are the conjugate bases of the hydrogen polysulfides H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Organic polysulfides generally have the formulae RS&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;R, where R = [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]].&lt;ref name=Steudel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Ralf|last=Steudel|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry|date=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/0470862106.ia233.pub2|chapter=Sulfur: Organic Polysulfanes|title=Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry|isbn=0470860782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, these anions have been obtained as organic salts, which are soluble in organic solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dev|first1= S. |last2=Ramli|first2= E. |last3=Rauchfuss|first3= T.

==Organic polysulfides==
[[Image:Lenthionine-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|130px|left|[[Lenthionine]] is an organic polysulfide found in [[shiitake mushroom]]s]]
In commerce, the term "polysulfide" usually refers to a class of polymers with alternating chains of several sulfur atoms and hydrocarbons. They have the formula R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. In this formula ''x'' indicates the number of sulfur atoms (or "rank"). Polysulfide polymers can be synthesized by [[condensation polymerization]] reactions between organic dihalides and alkali metal salts of polysulfide anions:

:''n''&amp;nbsp;Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&amp;nbsp;ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl → [CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''n''&amp;nbsp;NaCl

Dihalides used in this condensation polymerization are dichloroalkanes (such as [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]], bis-(2-chloroethyl)formal (ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl), and 1,3-dichloropropane).  The polymers are called [[Thiokol (polymer)|thiokols]]. In some cases, polysulfide polymers can be formed by [[ring-opening polymerization]] reactions.

Polysulfide polymers are also prepared by the addition of polysulfanes to alkenes. An idealized equation is:
:2&amp;nbsp;RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; → (RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;
In reality, homogeneous samples of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; are difficult to prepare.&lt;ref name=Steudel/&gt;

Polysulfide polymers are insoluble in water, oils, and many other organic solvents. Because of their solvent resistance, these materials find use as [[sealant]]s to fill the joints in pavement, automotive window glass, and aircraft structures.

Polymers containing one or two sulfur atoms separated by hydrocarbon sequences are usually not classified polysulfides, e.g. [[poly(p-phenylene sulfide)|poly(''p''-phenylene) sulfide]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Polysulfides in vulcanized rubber===
[[File:Vulcanization of POLYIsoprene V.2.png|thumb|320px|right|Idealized structure of two strands ({{color|blue|'''blue'''}} and {{color|green|'''green'''}}) of natural rubber after vulcanization with elemental sulfur, which forms polysulfide linkages.]]
Many commercial [[elastomer]]s contain polysulfides as [[cross-link|crosslinks]]. These crosslinks interconnect neighboring polymer chains, thereby conferring rigidity. The degree of rigidity is related to the number of crosslinks. Elastomers therefore have a characteristic ability to "snap back" to their original shape after being stretched or compressed. Because of this memory for their original [[curing (chemistry)|cured]] shape, elastomers are commonly referred to as [[rubber]]s. The process of crosslinking the polymer chains in these polymers with sulfur is called [[vulcanization]]. The sulfur chains attach themselves to the "allylic" carbon atoms, which are adjacent to C=C linkages. Vulcanization is a step in the processing of several classes of rubbers, including poly[[chloroprene]] ([[Neoprene]]), styrene-butadiene, and poly[[isoprene]], which is chemically similar to natural rubber. [[Charles Goodyear]]'s discovery of vulcanization, involving the heating of polyisoprene with sulfur, was revolutionary because it converted a sticky and almost useless material into an elastomer which could be fabricated into useful products.

==Occurrence in gas giants==
In addition to [[water]] and [[ammonia]], the clouds in the atmospheres of the [[gas giant]] planets contain ammonium sulfides. The reddish-brownish clouds are attributed to polysulfides, arising from the exposure of the ammonium sulfides to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-54256/Jupiter |title=Jupiter: Cloud composition |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polysulfides, as sulfides, can induce [[stress corrosion cracking]] in [[carbon steel]] and [[stainless steel]].

'''Recrystallization''' is a process by which deformed [[Crystallite|grains]] are replaced by a new set of defect-free grains that [[nucleation|nucleate]] and grow until the original grains have been entirely consumed. Recrystallization is usually accompanied by a reduction in the [[Strength of materials|strength]] and [[hardness]] of a material and a simultaneous increase in the [[ductility]]. Thus, the process may be introduced as a deliberate step in metals processing or may be an undesirable byproduct of another processing step. The most important industrial uses are softening of [[metals]] previously hardened or rendered brittle by [[cold work]], and control of the grain structure in the final product.

==Definition==
[[Image:RecrystallisationOfAluminium.jpg|thumb|355x355px|right|Three EBSD maps of the stored energy in an Al-Mg-Mn alloy after exposure to increasing recrystallization temperature. The volume fraction of recrystallized grains (light) increases with temperature for a given time. Luke Hagen]]

Recrystallization is defined as the process in which grains of a crystal structure come in a new structure or new crystal shape.

A precise definition of recrystallization is difficult to state as the process is strongly related to several other processes, most notably [[Recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]] and [[grain growth]]. In some cases it is difficult to precisely define the point at which one process begins and another ends. Doherty ''et al.'' (1997) defined recrystallization as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... the formation of a new grain structure in a deformed material by the formation and migration of high angle grain boundaries driven by the stored energy of deformation. High angle boundaries are those with greater than a 10-15° misorientation"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus the process can be differentiated from recovery (where high angle grain boundaries do not migrate) and grain growth (where the driving force is only due to the reduction in boundary area).
Recrystallization may occur during or after deformation (during cooling or a subsequent heat treatment, for example). The former is termed ''dynamic'' while the latter is termed ''static''. In addition, recrystallization may occur in a discontinuous manner, where distinct new grains form and grow, or a continuous manner, where the microstructure gradually evolves into a recrystallised microstructure. The different mechanisms by which recrystallization and recovery occur are complex and in many cases remain controversial. The following description is primarily applicable to static discontinuous recrystallization, which is the most classical variety and probably the most understood. Additional mechanisms include ([[Geometric Dynamic Recrystallization|geometric]]) [[dynamic recrystallization]] and [[strain induced boundary migration]].

''Secondary recrystallization'' occurs when a certain very small number of [[Miller index | {110}&lt;001&gt;]] (Goss) grains grow selectively, about one in 106 primary grains, at the expense of many other primary recrystallized grains. The mechanism of secondary recrystallization is a small and uniform primary grain size, achieved through the inhibition of normal grain growth by fine precipitates called inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Hayakawa (2017), "Mechanism of secondary recrystallization of Goss grains in grain-oriented electrical steel," ''Science and Technology of Advanced Materials'', '''18''':1, 480-497, {{doi|10.1080/14686996.2017.1341277}}. &lt;/ref&gt; Goss grains are named in honor of [[Norman P. Goss]], the inventor of grain-oriented [[electrical steel]] circa 1934.

==Laws of recrystallization==
There are several, largely empirical laws of recrystallization:
* ''Thermally activated''. The rate of the microscopic mechanisms controlling the nucleation and growth of recrystallized grains depend on the annealing temperature. [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius-type equations]] indicate an exponential relationship.
* ''Critical temperature''. Following from the previous rule it is found that recrystallization requires a minimum temperature for the necessary atomic mechanisms to occur. This ''recrystallization temperature'' decreases with annealing time.
* ''Critical deformation''. The prior deformation applied to the material must be adequate to provide nuclei and sufficient stored energy to drive their growth.
* ''Deformation affects the critical temperature''. Increasing the magnitude of prior deformation, or reducing the deformation temperature, will increase the stored energy and the number of potential nuclei. As a result, the recrystallization temperature will decrease with increasing deformation.
* ''Initial grain size affects the critical temperature''. [[grain boundary|Grain boundaries]] are good sites for nuclei to form. Since an increase in grain size results in fewer boundaries this results in a decrease in the nucleation rate and hence an increase in the recrystallization temperature
* ''Deformation affects the final grain size''. Increasing the deformation, or reducing the deformation temperature, increases the rate of nucleation faster than it increases the rate of growth. As a result, the final grain size is reduced by increased deformation.

==Driving force==
During plastic deformation the work performed is the integral of the stress and strain in the plastic deformation regime. Although the majority of this work is converted to heat, some fraction (~1–5%) is retained in the material as defects — particularly dislocations. The rearrangement or elimination of these dislocations will reduce the internal energy of the system and so there is a thermodynamic driving force for such processes. At moderate to high temperatures, particularly in materials with a high [[stacking fault energy]] such as aluminium and nickel, recovery occurs readily and free dislocations will readily rearrange themselves into subgrains surrounded by low-angle grain boundaries.
The driving force is the difference in energy between the deformed and recrystallized state Δ''E'' which can be determined by the dislocation density or the subgrain size and boundary energy (Doherty, 2005):

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta\ E \approx\;\rho\;Gb^2 \;{\rm or }\; \approx\;3\gamma_s/d_s \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the dislocation density, ''G'' is the shear modulus, ''b'' is the [[Burgers vector]] of the dislocations, ''γ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the subgrain boundary energy and ''d&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the subgrain size.

==Nucleation==
[[File:Ricristallizzazione e accrescimento.svg|thumb|500px|left|Recrystallization of a metallic material (a → b) and crystal grains growth (b → c → d).]]

Historically it was assumed that the nucleation rate of new recrystallized grains would be determined by the [[thermal fluctuations|thermal fluctuation]] model successfully used for [[solidification]] and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] phenomena. In this theory it is assumed that as a result of the natural movement of [[atoms]] (which increases with temperature) small nuclei would spontaneously arise in the matrix. The formation of these nuclei would be associated with an energy requirement due to the formation of a new interface and an energy liberation due to the formation of a new volume of lower energy material. If the nuclei were larger than some critical radius then it would be [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] stable and could start to grow. 
The main problem with this theory is that the stored energy due to dislocations is very low (0.1-1 Jm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) while the energy of a grain boundary is quite high (~0.5Jm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). Calculations based on these values found that the observed nucleation rate was greater than the calculated one by some impossibly large factor (~10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;).

As a result, the alternate theory proposed by Cahn in 1949 is now universally accepted. The recrystallized grains do not nucleate in the classical fashion but rather grow from pre-existing sub-grains and cells. The 'incubation time' is then a period of recovery where sub-grains with low-angle boundaries (&lt;1-2°) begin to accumulate [[dislocations]] and become increasingly misoriented with respect to their neighbors. The increase in misorientation increases the mobility of the boundary and so the rate of growth of the sub-grain increases. If one sub-grain in a local area happens to have an advantage over its neighbors (such as locally high dislocation densities, a greater size or favorable orientation) then this sub-grain will be able to grow more rapidly than its competitors. As it grows its boundary becomes increasingly misoriented with respect to the surrounding material until it can be recognized as an entirely new strain-free grain.

==Kinetics==
{{further|Avrami equation}}

[[Image:RXkinetics.svg|thumb|300px|left|Variation of recrystallized volume fraction with time]]

Recrystallization kinetics are commonly observed to follow the profile shown. There is an initial 'nucleation period' ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' where the nuclei form, and then begin to grow at a constant rate consuming the deformed matrix. Although the process does not strictly follow classical nucleation theory it is often found that such mathematical descriptions provide at least a close approximation. For an array of spherical grains the mean radius ''R'' at a time ''t'' is (Humphreys and Hatherly 2004):

: &lt;math&gt; R = G \left (t-t_0 \right ) \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

where ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the nucleation time and ''G'' is the growth rate dR/dt. If ''N'' nuclei form in the time increment ''dt'' and the grains are assumed to be spherical then the volume fraction will be:

: &lt;math&gt; f = \frac{4}{3} \pi\ \dot NG^3 \int_{0}^{t} (t-t_0)^3\, dt = \frac{ \pi\ }{3}\dot NG^3t^4 \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

This equation is valid in the early stages of recrystallization when ''f&lt;&lt;1'' and the growing grains are not impinging on each other. Once the grains come into contact the rate of growth slows and is related to the fraction of untransformed material (1-f) by the Johnson-Mehl equation:

: &lt;math&gt; f = 1 - \exp \left (- \frac{ \pi\ }{3} \dot NG^3t^4 \right ) \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

While this equation provides a better description of the process it still assumes that the grains are spherical, the nucleation and growth rates are constant, the nuclei are randomly distributed and the nucleation time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is small. In practice few of these are actually valid and alternate models need to be used.

It is generally acknowledged that any useful model must not only account for the initial condition of the material but also the constantly changing relationship between the growing grains, the deformed matrix and any second phases or other microstructural factors. The situation is further complicated in dynamic systems where deformation and recrystallization occur simultaneously. As a result, it has generally proven impossible to produce an accurate predictive model for industrial processes without resorting to extensive empirical testing. Since this may require the use of industrial equipment that has not actually been built there are clear difficulties with this approach.

===Factors influencing the rate===
The [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] temperature has a dramatic influence on the rate of recrystallization which is reflected in the above equations. However, for a given temperature there are several additional factors that will influence the rate.

The rate of recrystallization is heavily influenced by the amount of deformation and, to a lesser extent, the manner in which it is applied. Heavily deformed materials will recrystallize more rapidly than those deformed to a lesser extent. Indeed, below a certain deformation recrystallization may never occur. Deformation at higher temperatures will allow concurrent recovery and so such materials will recrystallize more slowly than those deformed at room temperature e.g. contrast [[hot rolling|hot]] and [[cold rolling]]. In certain cases deformation may be unusually homogeneous or occur only on specific [[crystallographic planes]]. The absence of orientation gradients and other heterogeneities may prevent the formation of viable nuclei. Experiments in the 1970s found that [[molybdenum]] deformed to a [[true strain]] of 0.3, recrystallized most rapidly when tensioned and at decreasing rates for [[wire drawing]], [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]] and [[compression (physical)|compression]] (Barto &amp; Ebert 1971).

The orientation of a grain and how the orientation changes during deformation influence the accumulation of stored energy and hence the rate of recrystallization. The mobility of the grain boundaries is influenced by their orientation and so some crystallographic textures will result in faster growth than others.

Solute atoms, both deliberate additions and impurities, have a profound influence on the recrystallization kinetics. Even minor concentrations may have a substantial influence e.g. 0.004% Fe increases the recrystallization temperature by around 100&amp;nbsp;°C (Humphreys and Hatherly 2004). It is currently unknown whether this effect is primarily due to the retardation of nucleation or the reduction in the mobility of grain boundaries i.e. growth.

==Influence of second phases==
Many alloys of industrial significance have some volume fraction of second phase particles, either as a result of impurities or from deliberate alloying additions. Depending on their size and distribution such particles may act to either encourage or retard recrystallization.

===Small particles===
[[Image:SmallParticlesRX.png|thumb|250px|right|The effect of a distribution of small particles on the grain size in a recrystallized sample. The minimum size occurs at the intersection of the growth stabilized]]

Recrystallization is prevented or significantly slowed by a dispersion of small, closely spaced particles due to [[Zener pinning]] on both low- and high-angle grain boundaries. This pressure directly opposes the driving force arising from the dislocation density and will influence both the nucleation and growth kinetics. The effect can be rationalized with respect to the ''particle dispersion level'' &lt;math&gt;F_v/r&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;F_v&lt;/math&gt; is the volume fraction of the second phase and r is the radius. At low &lt;math&gt; F_v/r &lt;/math&gt; the grain size is determined by the number of nuclei, and so initially may be very small. However the grains are unstable with respect to grain growth and so will grow during annealing until the particles exert sufficient pinning pressure to halt them. At moderate &lt;math&gt; F_v/r &lt;/math&gt; the grain size is still determined by the number of nuclei but now the grains are stable with respect to normal growth (while abnormal growth is still possible). At high &lt;math&gt;F_v/r&lt;/math&gt; the unrecrystallized deformed structure is stable and recrystallization is suppressed.

===Large particles===
The deformation fields around large (over 1&amp;nbsp;μm) non-deformable particles are characterised by high dislocation densities and large orientation gradients and so are ideal sites for the development of recrystallization nuclei. This phenomenon, called particle stimulated nucleation (PSN), is notable as it provides one of the few ways to control recrystallization by controlling the particle distribution.

[[Image:PsnRegimeGrainSize.png|thumb|400px|left|The effect of particle size and volume fraction on the recrystallized grain size (left) and the PSN regime (right)]]

The size and misorientation of the deformed zone is related to the particle size and so there is a minimum particle size required to initiate nucleation. Increasing the extent of deformation will reduce the minimum particle size, leading to a PSN regime in size-deformation space.
If the efficiency of PSN is one (i.e. each particle stimulates one nuclei), then the final grain size will be simply determined by the number of particles. Occasionally the efficiency can be greater than one if multiple nuclei form at each particle but this is uncommon. The efficiency will be less than one if the particles are close to the critical size and large fractions of small particles will actually prevent recrystallization rather than initiating it (see above).

===Bimodal particle distributions===
The recrystallization behavior of materials containing a wide distribution of particle sizes can be difficult to predict. This is compounded in alloys where the particles are thermally-unstable and may grow or dissolve with time. The situation is more simple in bimodal alloys which have two distinct particle populations. An example is Al-Si alloys where it has been shown that even in the presence of very large (&lt;5&amp;nbsp;μm) particles the recrystallization behavior is dominated by the small particles (Chan &amp; Humphreys 1984). In such cases the resulting microstructure tends to resemble one from an alloy with only small particles.

'''Rubblization''' is a construction and engineering technique that involves saving time and transportation costs by reducing existing concrete into [[rubble]] at its current location rather than hauling it to another location. Rubblization has two primary applications: creating a base for new roadways and decommissioning nuclear power plants.

==Road Construction==
In road construction, a worn-out [[Portland cement concrete]] can be rubblized and then overlaid with a new surface, usually [[asphalt concrete]]. Specialized equipment breaks up the old roadway into small pieces to make a base for new pavement. This saves the expense of transporting the old pavement to a disposal site, and purchasing/transporting new base materials for the replacement paving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antigoconstruction.com/news_121505.html|title=Largest Ever Rubblization &amp; Asphalt Overlay Project a Great Success|date=December 21, 2005 |accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a smoother pavement surface than would be obtained if a layer of asphalt were to be applied to the unbroken concrete surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Rubblization and Perpetual Pavement Save Money and Resources | title = National Symposium on HMA Energy and Recycling | place = Austin, Texas | date = 22–23 Oct 2007 | contribution-url = http://www.asphaltpavement.org/images/stories/Rubblization_and_Perpetual_Pavements.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique has been used on roads since the late 1990s, and is also being used for concrete airport runways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubsindex.trb.org/view.aspx?id=775292|title=Rubblization of Airfield Pavements: State of the Practice|date=January 2006|author=Buncher, Mark|author2=Jones, H Wayne|last-author-amp=yes|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rubblizing process provides many benefits versus other methods of road rehabilitation, such as crack and seat or removal and replacement of a concrete surface including: rubblizing a concrete surface is 52% less expensive than remove and replacing concrete; rubblizing reduces road reconstruction time, from days of lane closures to hours, providing large savings to contractors and reduced impact on travelling public; and rubblization is an environmentally friendly "green" process.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chirpe.com/ExhibitorHome.aspx?BoothID=439018&amp;EventID=800|title=RMI Worldwide LLC is a Provider of Concrete Rubblizing and Concrete Breaking Services and Equipment|date=January 22, 2008 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Rubblization: A Way to Save Time, Money, and Resources | journal = Hot Mix Asphalt Technology | date = July–August 2008 | first = Dave | last = Newcomb | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 12–16 | url = http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/naylor/NAPS0408/index.php?startid=12&amp;qs=rubblization#/12 | format = Flash | accessdate = 2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear Power Plants==
In nuclear energy regulation, "Rubblization" refers to a method for decommissioning a nuclear power plant. As with other decommissioning techniques,  all equipment from buildings is removed and the surfaces are decontaminated. The difference with rubblization is that above-grade structures, including the concrete containment building, are demolished into rubble and buried in the structure's foundation below ground. The site surface is then covered, regraded, and landscaped for unrestricted use.  This saves the expense of removing and transporting the building pieces to a different site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/rubblization.html|title=Glossary|accessdate=2010-01-02|author=Nuclear Regulatory Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sadun Boro''' (1928 – June 5, 2015) was the first Turkish amateur sailor to [[Circumnavigation#Global circumnavigation|circumnavigate the globe]] by [[sailing]].

==Early years==
Sadun Boro was born in [[Istanbul]], Turkey in 1928. He spent his childhood at Caddebostan neighnorhood of [[Kadıköy|Kadıköy, Istanbul]], on the coast of [[Sea of Marmara]]. He changed his rowing boat with a [[sailboat]] as soon as he became a high school student.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt; 

He finished [[Galatasaray High School]] in 1948, and went to the United Kingdom to study [[textile engineering]] at [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt; 

In 1952, Boro made his first ocean voyage from [[British Islands]] to the [[Caribbean Islands]] on the {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}}-long sailboat ''Ling'' together with an Englishman.&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt; The story of his travel that lasted six months was published in [[serial (literature)|serial format]] in the Turkish daily ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'', and was compiled in his book titled ''Bir Hayalin Peşinde'' (literally: In Pursuit of a Dream) later in 2004.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;

==Circumnavigation the globe==
[[File:Sadun Boro's Global Circumnavigation 1965-68.jpg|thumb|Route of Sadun Boro's global circumnavigation between 1965-68.]]
[[File:SadunOdaBoroStatueKadıköy.JPG|thumb|Monument of [[Circumnavigation#Global circumnavigation|Global Circumnavigation]] of Sadun Boro and his wife Oda in front of the [[Kalamış Marina]]'s main entrance at [[Kadıköy|Kadıköy, Istanbul]], Turkey.]]
His {{convert|10.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}-long [[sloop]] was laid down at the workshop of Athar Beşpınar in [[Salacak]] neidhborhood of [[Üsküdar|Üsküdar, Istanbul]] in 1963, and named ''Kısmet'' (Turkish for "Fortune").&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;  The sail, he manufactured in the textile plant, he was working at [[Çukurova]], southern Turkey.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

Boro began his westabout (east to west) voyage to circumnavigate the globe on August 22, 1965, accompanied by his German-born wife Oda Boro.&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nt1"/&gt; He set sail from [[Istanbul]], passed [[Strait of Gibraltar]] crossing [[Mediterranean Sea]] and reached [[Canary Islands]], where they took a housecat aboard and named it "Miço" (Turkish for "[[shipmate]]").&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt; Crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]], he arrived in [[Barbados]] and [[Caribbean|Caribbean Islands]]. Passing through the [[Panama Canal]], he sailed crossing [[Pacific Ocean]] to [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Marquesas Islands]], [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Archipelago]], [[Tahiti]], [[Society Islands]], [[Geography of Tonga|Tonga Islands]], [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], [[New Hebrides]] and [[New Guinea]]. His route went then through [[Torres Strait]] to [[Timor]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Singapore]]. Crossing the [[Bay of Bengal]], he was in [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] (today: Sri Lanka). He sailed then on [[Arabian Sea]] and [[Red Sea]] and then was carried by a truck from Eilat to Haifa. In Mediterranean Sea again, his last stop before completing his globe circumnavigation was [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="nt1"/&gt; 

On June 15, 1968, after 1,028 days of an ocean voyage, he arrived in Istanbul, where he was welcomed by his mother,&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; and cheered as a national hero. Becoming the first ever Turkish global circumnavigator,&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt; he paved the way for global circumnavigation of Turkish sailors.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;

The memories about his voyage around the world were published as newspaper serialization in the daily ''[[Hürriyet]]'' at that time, and were written down later in his popular book ''Pupa Yelken'' (Turkish for "Full Sail").&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

Erected in front of the [[Kalamış Marina]]'s main entrance in [[Kadıköy|Kadıköy, Istanbul]], a monument featuring Sadun Boro at boat's wheel of his sloop and his wife Oda standing next, both sailing on the globe commemorates his achievement.

==Later years==
Between 1977–79, Sadun Boro sailed with his wife and then-eight-year old daughter Deniz to the Caribbean and the [[East Coast of the United States]]. After 1980, he settled down in [[Bodrum]] and [[Gökova]], known for its idyllic coasts full of forests and turquoise sea.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt; 

He devoted himself to the protection of nature at the [[Turkish Riviera]], in particular in  Gökova, [[Göcek, Fethiye|Göcek]] and [[Fethiye]]. Boro aimed to instil love for nature and sea to young people with his articles published in newspapers and journals. As a lover of Gökova, he had a [[mermaid]] statue erected with an inscription atop a rock in the middle of Okluk Bay.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt; The inscription reads Boro's words as "This mermaid has traveled many seas and horizons to find the heaven that she dreamed of. She traveled continents, islands and bays, until she reached Gökova."&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt; His latest book, titled ''Vira Demir'' (Turkish for "Haul Up the Anchor"), is a guide for sailors.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;

Boro donated his sloop ''Kısmet'', he sailed 46-year long about {{convert|150000|nmi|mi km}} with, to the [[Rahmi M. Koç Museum]],&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt; a museum in Istanbul dedicated to the history of transport, industry and communications,&lt;ref name="nt1"/&gt; which was founded by the wealthy businessman [[Rahmi Koç]], who also circumnavigated the globe between 2004-06.&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;

Sadun Boro lived in Okluk Bay, Gökova  on board his [[catamaran]] named ''Son Bahar'' (Turkish for "Autumn" or "Last Spring").&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;

==Illness and death==
Sadun Boro was diagnosed with [[bladder cancer]]  a couple of years ago. He was first treated in [[Marmaris]], where he lived, and then transferred to the American Hospital in Istanbul. However, he was airlifted by helicopter back to [[Muğla]] on May 14, 2015 as he wished to spend his rest of life on board of his sailboat.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;

At 9:15 hours local time on June 5, 2015, he died at age 87 in the intensive care unit of a hospital at Marmaris, where he was taken into three days before.&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nt1"/&gt; His last will was to be buried under the pine, to which his sailboat is secured mooring at İngilizlimanı (literally: English Harbor) in Gökova. For its realization, a cabinet decision is necessary.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; He was interred in Karacasöğüt Cemetery in Marmaris following a memorial tour in the bays of the Turkish Riviera he admired on board of his catamaran ''Son Bahar'' accompanied by many boats and vessels of the [[Turkish Coast Guard]] and a frigate of the [[Turkish Navy]].&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

He was survived by his wife Oda and his daughter Deniz (Turkish for "Sea").&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nt1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3759">'''Sinking''' of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] is the act of pouring out champagne in the [[sink]]. Sinking probably started in [[Sweden]] as "a reaction to the ban on spraying champagne in many bars" and the sinking is usually done by a person ordering two bottles of champagne and asking the [[bartender]] to pour out (sink) one of them.&lt;ref name="dagens"&gt;Johan Åkesson, [http://www.dn.se/livsstil/reportage/vaskning-ar-bratsens-provokation "Vaskning är bratsens provokation" (Eng. ”Sinking is the brats’ provocation”)], ''Dagens Nyheter'', 2 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sinking" is a translation of the Swedish "vaskning", derived from "vask", which means "sink".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Naeslund, [http://walternaeslund.com/sinking-%E2%80%93-the-next-big-swedish-viral-export/ "Sinking - The Next Big Swedish Viral Export"], 14 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 2007 and 2010 respectively, bars in the Swedish cities of [[Båstad]] and [[Visby]], popular party destinations for the wealthy youth, banned the spraying of champagne.&lt;ref&gt;Kajsa Sundberg, [http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=6136195 "Slut utan prut på champagnesprut" (Eng. "End without much ado on champagne spraying")], ''Hela Gotland'', 13 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ban referred to champagne spraying possibly violating the law’s requirement on servers of alcohol to maintain good order.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Andersson, [http://sverigesradio.se/sida/play.aspx?ljud=2493952, "Frågetecken kring champagnesprut" (Eng. "Question marks around champagne spraying")], ''Sveriges Radio Gotland'', 19 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19941738.htm "Alkohollagen 6 kap 2 §" (Eng. "Alcohol law 6. chapter 2. §"], ''Notisum'', collected 24 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ban caused some people to sink the champagne instead, while others chose to buy more expensive champagne.&lt;ref name="vaskning"&gt;Josefine Hökerberg, [http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article12409512.ab "Vaskning – myt eller trend?" (Eng. "Sinking – myth or trend")], ''Aftonbladet'', 30 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marie Söderqvist, CEO of the analysis company [[United Minds]] and author of the book ''Status – vägen till lycka'' (Eng. ''Status – the road to happiness''), sinking is not just a protest against the ban on spraying champagne: "One gives the finger to everything – bans, global justice, saving the planet and equality."&lt;ref name="dagens"/&gt;

== Spread and Media Attention ==
Sinking has been the subject of articles by national newspapers like ''[[Aftonbladet]]''&lt;ref name="vaskning"/&gt; and ''[[Dagens Nyheter]],''&lt;ref name="dagens"/&gt; but it is unclear how much sinking actually occurs. In a survey among barkeepers in Båstad, [[Stockholm]], and Visby, one of them said they get "approximately one serious sinking request per night," while others claimed sinking was a myth.&lt;ref name="vaskning"/&gt;

Sinking has also been the theme of a music video by ''Kakan och Julia'' featured on [[Sveriges Television|Swedish Public Television]].&lt;ref&gt;Kakan och Julia, [http://svtplay.se/v/2157987 "Champagnevaskning" (Eng. "Champagne sinking")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311213130/http://svtplay.se/v/2157987 |date=2012-03-11 }}, ''Sveriges Television'', 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of the phenomenon have reportedly taken place, such as ''hamburger dumping'' (purchasing a large number of hamburgers at a [[fast food restaurant]], and throwing all but one into the trash). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftonbladet.se/sommarisverige/article12407312.ab&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''steelyard balance''', '''steelyard''', or '''stilyard''' is a straight-beam [[Weighing scale|balance]] with arms of unequal length. It incorporates a [[counterweight]] which slides along the longer arm to counterbalance the load and indicate its weight. A steelyard is also known as a  Roman steelyard or Roman balance.

[[Image:19th-century steelyard.png|thumb|right|A 19th-century steelyard.]]

=={{anchor|Constructure}}Structure==
The steelyard comprises a balance beam which is suspended from a Lever/pivot or fulcrum which is very close to one end of the beam. The two parts of the beam which flank the pivot are the arms. The arm from which the object to be weighed (the load) is hung is short and is located close to the pivot point. The other arm is longer, is graduated and incorporates a counterweight which can be moved along the arm until the two arms are balanced about the pivot, at which time the weight of the load is indicated by the position of the counterweight.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Bronze-Schnellwage mit Gewicht, Pompeji.jpg|thumb|[[Roman empire|Roman]] steelyard from [[Pompeii]]]]The steelyard exemplifies the [[lever|law of the lever]], wherein, when balanced, the weight of the object being weighed, multiplied by the length of the short balance arm to which it is attached, is equal to the weight of the counterweight multiplied by the distance of the counterweight from the pivot.

==History==
[[File:Grade II Listed Steelyard, Fountain Lane (geograph 3842770).jpg|thumb|Eighteenth century cart balance at Fountains Lane, [[Soham]]]]

According to Mark Sky  of [[Harvard University]], the steelyard was in use among Greek craftsmen of the 5th and 4th centuries BC, even before [[Archimedes]] demonstrated the law of the lever theoretically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Emily|title=Even Without Math, Ancients Engineered Sophisticated Machines|url=http://fas.harvard.edu/home/news_and_events/releases/math_10012007.html|publisher=Faculty of Arts &amp; Science, Harvard University|date=11 October 2007|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011010453/http://fas.harvard.edu/home/news_and_events/releases/math_10012007.html|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin name ''[[wikt:statera|statera]]'' comes from the Ancient Greek ''στατήρ'' (''statḗr''). Roman and Chinese steelyards were independently invented around 200 BC. Steelyards dating from AD 100 to 400 have been unearthed in [[Great Britain]].  Steelyards and their components have also been excavated from shipwrecks of the [[Byzantine]] period in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, such as the 7th-century wreck at [[Yassi Ada]], [[Turkey]], and the mid-first millennium [[The Shipwreck at Black Assarca Island, Eritrea|shipwreck at Black Assarca Island]], Eritrea. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' suggests that the name "steelyard" is derived from'' [[steel]]'' combined with ''[[yard]]'', influenced by a "misunderstood" allusion to the [[Steelyard]], the main trading base of the [[Hanseatic League]] in [[London]] in the 14th century.

Large steelyard balances (known as cart balances), both public and private, were a common feature in agricultural areas in England from the eighteenth century forward. An example of a public cart steelyard remains at [[Soham]], [[Cambridgeshire]] and another is to be seen at [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steelyard at the Fountain Inn|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1331736|website=[[Historic England]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slight|first1=James|last2=Burn|first2=Robert Scott|editor1-last=Stephens|editor1-first=Henry|title=The Book of Farm Implements &amp; Machines|publisher=Blackwood|location=Edinburgh|year=1868|oclc=458892190|pages=425–428|chapter=Machines for the products of the soil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fairhall|first1=David|title=East Anglian shores : history, harbours, rivers, fisheries, pubs and architecture|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781472903402|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Steelyards of different sizes have been used to weigh loads ranging from ounces to tons. A small steelyard could be a foot or less in length and thus conveniently used as a portable device that merchants and traders could use to weigh small ounce-sized items of merchandise. In other cases a steelyard could be several feet long and used to weigh sacks of flour and other commodities. Even larger steelyards were three stories tall and used to weigh fully laden [[horse drawn cart|horse-drawn cart]]s.

==Scandinavia's steelyard==
A [[Scandinavia]]n steelyard is a variant which consists of a bar with a fixed weight attached to one end, a movable pivot point and an attachment point for the object to be weighed at the other end. Once the object to be weighed is attached to its end of the bar, the pivot point, which is frequently a loop at the end of a cord or chain, is moved until the bar is balanced. The bar can be calibrated so that the object's weight can be read off directly from the position of the pivot. This type is known in [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]].

'''''The Great Resistance''''' (French: ''Au pays des colons'') is a 2007 [[Documentary film|documentary]] by Quebec film director [[Denys Desjardins]].  This length feature is [[film producer|produced]] by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB).

==Synopsis==
In the 1930s, in the throes of the [[Great Depression]], the government of [[Quebec]] relocated more than 80,000 citizens to found a new settlement in the virgin forests of Quebec’s [[Abitibi-Témiscamingue|Abitibi]] region. After enduring backbreaking work to clear the land, however, many left, seeking a better life in the city or as labourers for the large corporations that had come to exploit the North’s valuable resources. The Lalancette family, however, have persisted in forging their future on the land from one generation to the next, earning their keep from farming, and defying the constraints of [[globalization]] and the mining and forestry companies that control the area. Revisiting the heritage of Quebec filmmakers who documented Abitibi, following in the footsteps of [[Pierre Perrault]], among others, this documentary traces a defining chapter of [[Quebec history]] and raises fundamental questions about regional development.

==Award==
* Nominated in 2008 for a [[Jutra Award]] for Best Documentary.

A '''transient-voltage-suppression''' ('''TVS''') '''diode''', also '''transil''' or '''thyrector''', is an [[electronic component]] used to protect  [[electronics]] from [[voltage spike]]s induced on connected wires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Description ==
The device operates by shunting excess current when the induced voltage exceeds the [[avalanche breakdown]] potential. It is a [[Clamp (circuit)|clamping]] device, suppressing all overvoltages above its breakdown voltage. It automatically resets when the overvoltage goes away, but absorbs much more of the transient energy internally than a similarly rated [[Crowbar (circuit)|crowbar]] device.

A transient-voltage-suppression diode may be either unidirectional or bidirectional. A unidirectional device operates as a [[rectifier]] in the forward direction like any other [[avalanche diode]], but is made and tested to handle very large peak currents.

A bidirectional transient-voltage-suppression diode can be represented by two mutually opposing avalanche diodes in series with one another and connected in parallel with the circuit to be protected. While this representation is schematically accurate, physically the devices are now manufactured as a single component.

A transient-voltage-suppression diode can respond to over-voltages faster than other common over-voltage protection components such as [[varistor]]s or [[Surge protector#Gas discharge tube (GDT)|gas discharge tubes (GDT)]]. The actual clamping occurs in roughly one [[picosecond]], but in a practical circuit the [[inductance]] of the wires leading to the device imposes a higher limit. This makes transient-voltage-suppression diodes useful for protection against very fast and often damaging voltage transients. These fast over-voltage transients are present on all distribution networks and can be caused by either internal or external events, such as lightning or motor arcing.

[[Transient voltage suppressor]]s will fail if they are subjected to voltages or conditions beyond those that the particular product was designed to accommodate. There are three key modes in which the TVS will fail: short, open, and degraded device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last = | first = | title = Failure Modes and Fusing of TVS Devices |url = http://www.vishay.com/docs/88440/failurem.pdf | publisher = [[Vishay Intertechnology|Vishay General Semiconductor]] | date = 13 August 2007 | accessdate = 8 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TVS diodes are sometimes referred to as transorbs, from the [[Vishay Intertechnology|Vishay]] trademark ''TransZorb''.
[[File:Combined TVS and rail-to-rail diodes.svg|thumb|Combined TVS and rail-to-rail diode (unidirectional)]]

== Characterization ==
A TVS diode is characterized by:
* ''[[Leakage current]]:'' the amount of current conducted when voltage applied is below the maximum reverse standoff voltage.
* ''[[Maximum reverse standoff voltage]]'': the voltage below which no significant conduction occurs.
* ''[[Breakdown voltage]]:'' the voltage at which some specified and significant conduction occurs.
* ''[[Clamping voltage]]'': the voltage at which the device will conduct its fully rated current (hundreds to thousands of [[ampere]]s).
* ''[[Parasitic capacitance]]:'' The nonconducting diode behaves like a [[capacitor]], which can distort and corrupt high-speed signals. Lower capacitance is generally preferred.
* ''[[Parasitic inductance]]:'' Because the actual over voltage switching is so fast, the package inductance is the limiting factor for response speed.
* ''Amount of energy it can absorb:'' Because the transients are so brief, all of the energy is initially stored internally as heat; a [[heat sink]] only affects the time to cool down afterwards. Thus, a high-energy TVS must be physically large. If this capacity is too small, the over voltage will possibly destroy the device and leave the circuit unprotected.

'''Waman Bapuji Metre''' (14 February 1906&amp;nbsp;– 21 November 1970), sometimes referred to in the Indian oil industry as '''Dada'''  (meaning ''Elder brother Metre'' in the Bengali and Marathi languages), was an Indian petroleum geologist.  For his "significant contribution to the growth of the oil industry in the country", he was awarded India's third-highest civilian award, the [[Padma Bhushan]], in 1968.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wood-free paper''' is [[paper]] created exclusively from [[chemical pulp]] rather than [[mechanical pulp]]. Chemical pulp is normally made from  [[pulpwood]], but is not considered [[wood]] as most of the [[lignin]] is removed and separated from the [[cellulose fiber]]s during processing, whereas mechanical pulp retains most of its wood components and can therefore still be described as wood. Wood-free paper is not as susceptible to yellowing as paper containing mechanical pulp.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29978">In [[solid-state physics]], the '''work function''' (sometimes spelled '''workfunction''') is the minimum [[thermodynamic work]] (i.e. energy) needed to remove an [[electron]] from a solid to a point in the [[vacuum]] immediately outside the solid surface. Here "immediately" means that the final electron position is far from the surface on the atomic scale, but still too close to the solid to be influenced by ambient electric fields in the vacuum.
The work function is not a characteristic of a bulk material, but rather a property of the surface of the material (depending on crystal face and contamination).

== Definition ==

The work function {{math|''W''}} for a given surface is defined by the difference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |edition=7th |last1=Kittel |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Kittel |date= &lt;!--replace this comment with the publication year--&gt; |publisher=Wiley }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W = -e\phi - E_{\rm F}, &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|−''e''}} is the charge of an [[electron]], {{math|''ϕ''}} is the [[electrostatic potential]] in the vacuum nearby the surface, and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Fermi level]] ([[electrochemical potential]] of electrons) inside the material. The term {{math|−''eϕ''}} is the energy of an electron at rest in the vacuum nearby the surface.

[[File:Work function mismatch gold aluminum.svg|thumb|300 px|Plot of electron energy levels against position, in a gold-vacuum-aluminium system. The two metals depicted here are in complete thermodynamic equilibrium. However, the vacuum [[electrostatic potential]] {{math|''ϕ''}} is not flat due to a difference in work function.]]

In practice, one directly controls {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} by the voltage applied to the material through electrodes, and the work function is generally a fixed characteristic of the surface material. Consequently, this means that when a voltage is applied to a material, the electrostatic potential {{math|''ϕ''}} produced in the vacuum will be somewhat lower than the applied voltage, the difference depending on the work function of the material surface. Rearranging the above equation, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = V - \frac{W}{e}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''V'' {{=}} −''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/''e''}} is the voltage of the material (as measured by a [[voltmeter]], through an attached electrode), relative to an [[electrical ground]] that is defined as having zero Fermi level. The fact that {{math|''ϕ''}} depends on material surface means that the space between two dissimilar conductors will have a built-in [[electric field]], when those conductors are in total equilibrium with each other (electrically shorted to each other, and with equal temperatures). An example of this situation is depicted in the adjacent figure. As described in the next section, these built-in vacuum electric fields can have important consequences in some cases.

== Applications ==

;[[Thermionic emission]]: In thermionic [[electron gun]]s, the work function and temperature of the [[hot cathode]] are critical parameters in determining the amount of current that can be emitted. [[Tungsten]], the common choice for vacuum tube filaments, can survive to high temperatures but its emission is somewhat limited due to its relatively high work function (approximately 4.5 eV). By coating the tungsten with a substance of lower work function (e.g., [[thorium]] or [[barium oxide]]), the emission can be greatly increased. This prolongs the lifetime of the filament by allowing operation at lower temperatures (for more information, see [[hot cathode]]).
;[[Band bending]] models in solid-state electronics: The behavior of a solid-state device is strongly dependent on the size of various [[Schottky barrier]]s and [[heterojunction|band offset]]s in the junctions of differing materials, such as metals, semiconductors, and insulators. Some commonly used heuristic approaches to predict the band alignment between materials, such as [[Anderson's rule]] and the [[Schottky-Mott rule]], are based on the thought experiment of two materials coming together in vacuum, such that the surfaces charge up and adjust their work functions to become equal just before contact. In reality these work function heuristics are inaccurate due to their neglect of numerous microscopic effects. However. they provide a convenient estimate until the true value can be determined by experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Kroemer]], "[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/kroemer-lecture.html Quasi-Electric Fields and Band Offsets: Teaching Electrons New Tricks]" Nobel lecture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/physics/tung/Schottky/systematics.htm|title=Barrier Height Correlations and Systematics|author=|date=|website=academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Equilibrium electric fields in vacuum chambers: Variation in work function between different surfaces causes a non-uniform electrostatic potential in the vacuum. Even on an ostensibly uniform surface, variations in {{math|''W''}} known as patch potentials are always present due to microscopic inhomogeneities. Patch potentials have disrupted sensitive apparatus that rely on a perfectly uniform vacuum, such as [[Casimir force]] experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.85.012504| title = Modeling electrostatic patch effects in Casimir force measurements| journal = Physical Review A| volume = 85| issue = 1| pages = 012504| year = 2012| last1 = Behunin | first1 = R.

;[[Contact electrification]]: If two conducting surfaces are moved relative to each other, and there is potential difference in the space between them, then an electric current will be driven. This is because the [[surface charge]] on a conductor depends on the magnitude of the electric field, which in turn depends on the distance between the surfaces. The externally observed electrical effects are largest when the conductors are separated by the smallest distance without touching (once brought into contact, the charge will instead flow internally through the junction between the conductors). Since two conductors in equilibrium can have a built-in potential difference due to work function differences, this means that bringing dissimilar conductors into contact, or pulling them apart, will drive electric currents. These contact currents can damage sensitive microelectronic circuitry and occur even when the conductors would be grounded in the absence of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomas Iii | first1 = S.

== Measurement ==

Certain physical phenomena are highly sensitive to the value of the work function.
The observed data from these effects can be fitted to simplified theoretical models, allowing one to extract a value of the work function.
These phenomenologically extracted work functions may be slightly different from the thermodynamic definition given above.
For inhomogeneous surfaces, the work function varies from place to place, and different methods will yield different values of the typical "work function" as they average or select differently among the microscopic work functions.&lt;ref name="pitfalls"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Helander | first1 = M.

Many techniques have been developed based on different physical effects to measure the electronic work function of a sample. One may distinguish between two groups of experimental methods for work function measurements: absolute and relative.

* Absolute methods employ electron emission from the sample induced by photon absorption (photoemission), by high temperature (thermionic emission), due to an electric field ([[field electron emission]]), or using [[quantum tunneling|electron tunnelling]].
* Relative methods make use of the [[contact potential difference]] between the sample and a reference electrode. Experimentally, either an anode current of a diode is used or the displacement current between the sample and reference, created by an artificial change in the capacitance between the two, is measured (the [[Kelvin probe force microscope|Kelvin Probe]] method, [[Kelvin probe force microscope]]).

=== Methods based on thermionic emission ===

The work function is important in the theory of [[thermionic emission]], where thermal fluctuations provide enough energy to "evaporate" electrons out of a hot material (called the 'emitter') into the vacuum. If these electrons are absorbed by another, cooler material (called the ''collector'') then a measurable [[electric current]] will be observed. Thermionic emission can be used to measure the work function of both the hot emitter and cold collector. Generally, these measurements involve fitting to [[Richardson's law]], and so they must be carried out in a low temperature and low current regime where [[space charge]] effects are absent.

[[File:Thermionic diode forward bias.svg|thumb|300px|Energy level diagrams for [[thermionic diode]] in ''forward bias'' configuration, used to extract all hot electrons coming out from the emitter's surface. The barrier is the vacuum near emitter surface.]]

In order to move from the hot emitter to the vacuum, an electron's energy must exceed the emitter Fermi level by an amount
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm barrier} = W_{\rm e}&lt;/math&gt;
determined simply by the thermionic work function of the emitter.
If an electric field is applied towards the surface of the emitter, then all of the escaping electrons will be accelerated away from the emitter and absorbed into whichever material is applying the electric field.
According to [[Richardson's law]] the emitted [[current density]] (per unit area of emitter), ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), is related to the absolute [[temperature]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of the emitter by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;J_{\rm e} = -A_{\rm e} T_{\rm e}^2 e^{-E_{\rm barrier} / k T_{\rm e}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and the proportionality constant ''A''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Richardson's constant]] of the emitter.
In this case, the dependence of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; can be fitted to yield ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.

==== Work function of cold electron collector ====
[[File:Thermionic diode reverse bias.svg|thumb|300px|Energy level diagrams for [[thermionic diode]] in ''retarding potential'' configuration. The barrier is the vacuum near collector surface.]]

The same setup can be used to instead measure the work function in the collector, simply by adjusting the applied voltage.
If an electric field is applied ''away from'' the emitter instead, then most of the electrons coming from the emitter will simply be reflected back to the emitter. Only the highest energy electrons will have enough energy to reach the collector, and the height of the potential barrier in this case depends on the collector's work function, rather than the emitter's.

The current is still governed by Richardson's law. However, in this case the barrier height does not depend on ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;. The barrier height now depends on the work function of the collector, as well as any additional applied voltages:&lt;ref&gt;G.L. Kulcinski, "Thermionic Energy
Conversion" [http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture9.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm barrier} = W_{\rm c} - e (\Delta V_{\rm ce} - \Delta V_{\rm S})&lt;/math&gt;
where ''W''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the collector's thermionic work function, ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt; is the applied collector–emitter voltage, and ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Seebeck effect|Seebeck voltage]] in the hot emitter (the influence of ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is often omitted, as it is a small contribution of order 10 mV).
The resulting current density ''J''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; through the collector (per unit of collector area) is again given by [[Richardson's Law]], except now
:&lt;math&gt;J_{\rm c} = A T_{\rm e}^2 e^{-E_{\rm barrier}/kT_{\rm e}} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is a Richardson-type constant that depends on the collector material but may also depend on the emitter material, and the diode geometry.
In this case, the dependence of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, or on ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt;, can be fitted to yield ''W''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.

This '''retarding potential method''' is one of the simplest and oldest methods of measuring work functions, and is advantageous since the measured material (collector) is not required to survive high temperatures.

=== Methods based on photoemission ===

[[File:Photoelectric diode forward bias.svg|thumb|300 px|Photoelectric diode in ''forward bias'' configuration, used for measuring the work function ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of the illuminated emitter.]]

The photoelectric work function is the minimum [[photon]] energy required to liberate an electron from a substance, in the [[photoelectric effect]].
If the photon's energy is greater than the substance's work function, [[photoelectric effect|photoelectric emission]] occurs and the electron is liberated from the surface.
Similar to the thermionic case described above, the liberated electrons can be extracted into a collector and produce a detectable current, if an electric field is applied into the surface of the emitter.
Excess photon energy results in a liberated electron with non-zero kinetic energy.
It is expected that the minimum [[photon energy]] &lt;math&gt; \hbar \omega &lt;/math&gt; required to liberate an electron (and generate a current) is 
:&lt;math&gt;\hbar \omega = W_{\rm e} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the work function of the emitter.

Photoelectric measurements require a great deal of care, as an incorrectly designed experimental geometry can result in an erroneous measurement of work function.&lt;ref name="pitfalls"/&gt; This may be responsible for the large variation in work function values in scientific literature.
Moreover, the minimum energy can be misleading in materials where there are no actual electron states at the Fermi level that are available for excitation. For example, in a semiconductor the minimum photon energy would actually correspond to the [[valence band]] edge rather than work function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/ep/SurfaceScience/PEE.html|title=Photoelectron Emission|author=|date=|website=www.virginia.edu|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, the photoelectric effect may be used in the retarding mode, as with the thermionic apparatus described above. In the retarding case, the dark collector's work function is measured instead.

=== Kelvin probe method ===
{{see also|Volta potential|Kelvin probe force microscope}}

[[File:Kelvin probe setup at flat vacuum.svg|thumb|300 px|Kelvin probe energy diagram at flat vacuum configuration, used for measuring work function difference between sample and probe.]]

The Kelvin probe technique relies on the detection of an electric field (gradient in ''ϕ'') between a sample material and probe material.
The electric field can be varied by the voltage ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; that is applied to the probe relative to the sample.
If the voltage is chosen such that the electric field is eliminated (the flat vacuum condition), then
:&lt;math&gt;e\Delta V_{\rm sp} = W_{\rm s} - W_{\rm p}, \quad \text{when}~\phi~\text{is flat}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since the experimenter controls and knows ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;, then finding the flat vacuum condition gives directly the work function difference between the two materials.
The only question is, how to detect the flat vacuum condition?
Typically, the electric field is detected by varying the distance between the sample and probe. When the distance is changed but ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant, a current will flow due to the change in [[capacitance]]. This current is proportional to the vacuum electric field, and so when the electric field is neutralized no current will flow.

Although the Kelvin probe technique only measures a work function difference, it is possible to obtain an absolute work function by first calibrating the probe against a reference material (with known work function) and then using the same probe to measure a desired sample.
The Kelvin probe technique can be used to obtain work function maps of a surface with extremely high spatial resolution, by using a sharp tip for the probe (see [[Kelvin probe force microscope]]).

Below is a table of work function values for various elements.
Note that the work function depends on the configurations of atoms at the surface of the material. For example, on polycrystalline silver the work function is 4.26 eV, but on silver crystals it varies for different crystal faces as [[Miller index|(100) face]]: 4.64 eV, [[Miller index|(110) face]]: 4.52 eV, [[Miller index|(111) face]]: 4.74 eV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dweydari | first1 = A.

== Physical factors that determine the work function ==

Due to the complications described in the modelling section below, it is difficult to theoretically predict the work function with accuracy. Various trends have, however, been identified. The work function tends to be smaller for metals with an open lattice, and larger for metals in which the atoms are closely packed. It is somewhat higher on dense crystal faces than open crystal faces, also depending on [[surface reconstruction]]s for the given crystal face.

=== Surface dipole ===

The work function is not simply dependent on the "internal vacuum level" inside the material (i.e., its average electrostatic potential), because of the formation of an atomic-scale [[Double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer]] at the surface.&lt;ref name="venables"/&gt; This surface electric dipole gives a jump in the electrostatic potential between the material and the vacuum.

A variety of factors are responsible for the surface electric dipole. Even with a completely clean surface, the electrons can spread slightly into the vacuum, leaving behind a slightly positively charged layer of material. This primarily occurs in metals, where the bound electrons do not encounter a hard wall potential at the surface but rather a gradual ramping potential due to [[image charge]] attraction. The amount of surface dipole depends on the detailed layout of the atoms at the surface of the material, leading to the variation in work function for different crystal faces.

=== Doping and electric field effect (semiconductors) ===

[[File:Semiconductor vacuum junction.svg|thumb|[[Band diagram]] of semiconductor-vacuum interface showing [[electron affinity]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;EA&lt;/sub&gt;, defined as the difference between near-surface vacuum energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt;, and near-surface [[conduction band]] edge ''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. Also shown: [[Fermi level]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, [[valence band]] edge ''E''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, work function ''W''.]]

In a [[semiconductor]], the work function is sensitive to the [[doping (semiconductor)|doping level]] at the surface of the semiconductor. Since the doping near the surface can also be [[field effect (semiconductor)|controlled by electric fields]], the work function of a semiconductor is also sensitive to the electric field in the vacuum.

The reason for the dependence is that, typically, the vacuum level and the conduction band edge retain a fixed spacing independent of doping. This spacing is called the [[electron affinity]] (note that this has a different meaning than the electron affinity of chemistry); in silicon for example the electron affinity is 4.05 eV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virginiasemi.com/pdf/generalpropertiessi62002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; If the electron affinity ''E''&lt;sub&gt;EA&lt;/sub&gt; and the surface's band-referenced Fermi level ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;-''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; are known, then the work function is given by
:&lt;math&gt; W = E_{\rm EA} + E_{\rm C} - E_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is taken at the surface.

From this one might expect that by doping the bulk of the semiconductor, the work function can be tuned. In reality, however, the energies of the bands near the surface are often pinned to the Fermi level, due to the influence of [[surface state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/physics/tung/Schottky/surface.htm|title=Semiconductor Free Surfaces|author=|date=|website=academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a large density of surface states, then the work function of the semiconductor will show a very weak dependence on doping or electric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bardeen | first1 = J. | title = Surface States and Rectification at a Metal Semi-Conductor Contact | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.71.717 | journal = Physical Review | volume = 71 | issue = 10 | pages = 717–727 | year = 1947 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1947PhRv...71..717B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical models of metal work functions ===

&lt;!-- resource: http://venables.asu.edu/qmms/PROJ/metal1a.html --&gt;

Theoretical modeling of the work function is difficult, as an accurate model requires a careful treatment of both electronic [[many-body problem|many body effects]] and [[surface chemistry]]; both of these topics are already complex in their own right.

One of the earliest successful models for metal work function trends was the [[jellium]] model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = N. | last2 = Kohn | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.3.1215 | title = Theory of Metal Surfaces: Work Function | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 1215 | year = 1971 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1971PhRvB...3.1215L }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed for oscillations in electronic density nearby the abrupt surface (these are similar to [[Friedel oscillation]]s) as well as the tail of electron density extending outside the surface. This model showed why the density of conduction electrons (as represented by the [[Wigner-Seitz radius]] ''r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') is an important parameter in determining work function.

The jellium model is only a partial explanation, as its predictions still show significant deviation from real work functions. More recent models have focussed on including more accurate forms of [[electron exchange]] and correlation effects, as well as including the crystal face dependence (this requires the inclusion of the actual atomic lattice, something that is neglected in the jellium model).&lt;ref name="venables"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780080536347 | title = Metal Surface Electron Physics | last1 = Kiejna | first1 = A. | last2 = Wojciechowski | first2 = K.F. | date = 1996 | publisher = [[Elsevier]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electron behavior in metals varies with temperature and is largely reflected by the electron work function. A recent theoretical model for predicting the temperature dependence of the electron work function, developed by Reza Rahemi et. al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rahemi|first1=Reza|last2=Li|first2=Dongyang|title=Variation in electron work function with temperature and its effect on the Young's modulus of metals|journal=Scripta Materialia|date=April 2015|volume=99|issue=2015|pages=41–44|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2014.11.022|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135964621400493X|arxiv=1503.08250}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains the underlying mechanism and predicts this temperature dependence for various crystal structures via calculable and measurable parameters.
