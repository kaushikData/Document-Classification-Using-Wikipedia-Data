The [[Russian Federation]] uses a five-point [[academic grading]] system, where:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''5'''|| "Excellent" (Russian пять {{IPA-ru|ˈpʲætʲ|}}, отлично {{IPA-ru|ɐtʲˈlʲitɕnɐ|}}), denotes highest distinction and excellent knowledge of a subject
|-
| '''4'''|| "Good" (Russian четыре {{IPA-ru|tɕɪˈtɨrʲɪ|}}, хорошо {{IPA-ru|xərɐˈʂo|}}), denotes good knowledge of a subject
|-
| '''3'''|| "Satisfactory" (Russian три {{IPA-ru|ˈtrʲi|}}, удовлетворительно {{IPA-ru|ʊdəvlʲɪtvɐˈrʲitʲɪlʲnə|}}), sometimes translated as "Fair", denotes a creditable or passing grade
|-
| '''2'''|| "Unsatisfactory" (Russian два {{IPA-ru|ˈdva|}}, неудовлетворительно, abbr. "неуд" {{IPA-ru|ˈnʲɛʊt|}}), denotes limited knowledge of a subject, below average, the first level of failing
|-
| '''1'''|| "Very Poor" (Russian единица, очень плохо), the lowest possible grade, denotes complete failure, and is very rarely used
|}

This system, with minor changes, has been in use in Russian schools since 1837. Between 1917 and 1935, the Communist government had tried to implement a radically new evaluation system with no grades at all, but it never fully took root.

Qualifiers + and &amp;ndash; are often used to add some degree of differentiation between the grades, e.g. 4+ is better than 4 but not as good as 5&amp;ndash;. Grading varies greatly from school to school, university to university and even teacher to teacher, and tends to be entirely subjective even for courses that lend themselves to objective marking such as mathematics and applied sciences. Even though the grades technically range from "1" to "5", "1" is not very common and is rarely given for academic reasons&amp;mdash;in many cases a "1" is given as a result of failure to show up for an exam or to answer any questions. A "2" grade usually  means that the student showed little or no knowledge in a subject. 

In higher education, most subjects are graded ‘Pass/No pass’ ('Credit/No Credit') (зачёт/незачёт, pronounced "zachòt/nyezachòt"), and the rest are graded on the five-point scale. The 'Pass/No Pass' grades have no official numeric representation. When "zachòt"-type subjects are graded ‘Pass/No pass’ (sometimes translated as ‘Credit/No credit’), this simply represents a student's good/poor knowledge of a subject. "Zachòt"-type subjects are also called "non-exams" due to lack of numerical representations. Each university applies its own standards of the level of knowledge required to pass each course. Students in Russia typically must pass all courses taken in order to graduate. 

The various possible interpretations of the notation "zachòt" (usually translated "credit" or "pass"), can create problems for Russian students applying to Western universities. Such notations, especially when people consider "zachòt"-type credit as a C, may confuse Western universities in their attempts at accurate conversion to a Western-system GPA.

'''''Airport Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game]] released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows 95/98]] in 2000. It was developed in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Krisalis Software]] (now defunct). In ''Airport Tycoon'', the player must successfully build and manage an airport without going bankrupt. There have been two sequels created for ''Airport Tycoon'': ''Airport Tycoon 2'' and ''Airport Tycoon 3''. There was to be a [[Nintendo 64]] version released as well, but this version was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/03/airport-inc-64-cancelled/|title=Airport Inc. 64 [N64 - Cancelled] - Unseen64|date=3 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Airport Tycoon'' was originally called ''Airport Inc.'' and ''Air Mogul''. A week before the game's publishing, Krisalis Software changed its name to ''Airport Tycoon'' in some markets, a more catchy title. However, the game calls itself ''Air Mogul'' because of the inadequate time to change the software, and is sold in [[PAL]] as ''Airport Inc.'' Krisalis became defunct shortly after publishing ''Airport Tycoon''.

==Gameplay==
Similar to other games of this type, the player takes the form of an airport manager by first selecting a location for his or her airport from several cities around the world before beginning his or her airport. The player then constructs a terminal for passengers, then runways, tarmac, control towers and support services.

The player then attracts businesses to his or her airport by signing contracts with vendors in the terminal and contracting flights into and out of the airport. The player also manages the airport's budget, which can not operate too deeply in the red. Players can operate passenger airports and cargo airports with different considerations for each.

A number of preset scenarios are also available to the player, including the conversion of a major cargo airport to a passenger airport in [[Beijing]].

==Reception==
The game was poorly received by critics.{{cn|date=October 2017}} Frequent criticisms included difficulty of gameplay, substandard graphics and confusing controls.{{cn|date=October 2017}} It received a 62/100 score from [[PC Gamer]],{{cn|date=October 2017}} 3/10 from [[IGN]],{{cn|date=October 2017}} among other rankings.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Sequels==
''Airport Tycoon'' was followed by a sequel, ''Airport Tycoon 2'', in 2003. It was developed by [[Sunstorm Interactive]] and published by [[Global Star Software]] on February 26, 2003 for Windows PC. ''Airport Tycoon 2'' received negative reviews from critics. Aggregating review website [[GameRankings]] provides an average score of 31% based on 9 reviews,&lt;ref name="GRPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/563583-airport-tycoon-2/index.html |title=Airport Tycoon 2 (PC) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |date= February 26, 2003|accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Metacritic]] provides a score of 32 out of 100 based on 6 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews."&lt;ref name="MCPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/airport-tycoon-2 |title=Airport Tycoon 2 (PC) |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |date= February 26, 2003|accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third game in the series, ''Airport Tycoon 3'', was developed by InterActive Vision and published by Global Star on October 30, 2003. Based on four professional reviews, Metacritic finds that ''Airport Tycoon 3'' has received "generally unfavorable" reviews and establishes a metascore of 46/100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/airporttycoon3|title=Airport Tycoon 3 (pc: 2003): Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2012-06-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090506085124/http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/airporttycoon3| archivedate= 6 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airport Tycoon received negative reviews by [[IGN]] and [[GameSpot]] calling the game "irritating and monotonous", and the general review of the game on both the sites stated that the game was "lackluster" and "bland" not only in gameplay but in sound and texture, and its mechanics were "tedious". GameSpot's final comment on the game was that "It's unfortunate that the execution in the game is so disappointing in virtually every respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport Tycoon Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/06/airport-tycoon-3-review|website=IGN|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport Tycoon 3 Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/airport-tycoon-3-review/1900-6086428/|website=GameSpot|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3062">The '''American Association of Teachers of German''' is a professional organisation for teachers of [[German Language|German]] in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Teachers may be involved in primary, secondary, or university education. Additionally, retired and student teachers are welcome.

==AATG National German Exam==
The National German Exam is administered each year to over 25,000 high school students of German.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aatg.org/?page=NGE&lt;/ref&gt; The exam provides individual diagnostic feedback, rewards students through an extensive regional and national prize program, and creates a sense of accomplishment. Exam results provide teachers a means of comparing students in all regions of the country, as well as programmatic data provided to help inform curricular decisions. The Exam is administered in December and January and results are provided directly to teachers in February.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aatg.org/?page=NGECal&lt;/ref&gt;

===NGE Study Trip Award Scholarship===
For over 50 years, the Federal Republic of Germany, through the German Foreign Office (Auswärtiges Amt) and its Pedagogical Exchange Service (Pädagogischer Austauschdienst), has provided the AATG/PAD Study Trip Awards, a 3-4 week trip to Germany in the summer following the Exam. Students attend classes at an academic high school, stay in homestays, and participate in various excursions to places of cultural significance. The initial selection process takes place through the AATG National German Exam: Those students who score at or above the 90th percentile and meet eligibility requirements&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aatg.org/page/StudyTripAward&lt;/ref&gt; are informed that they can apply for the Study Trip Award. Of those who apply, two candidates are selected from each state by the AATG Chapter committee: Award 1, a sophomore or junior, and award 2, a senior. These candidates' applications are then sent to the National AATG Selection Committee, which makes the final decisions.&lt;ref&gt;https://aatg.site-ym.com/general/custom.asp?page=NGEStudyTripApp&lt;/ref&gt;

==AATG Endowed Scholarship==
Each year up to four recipients of this scholarship are selected from the applicants for the National German Exam Study Trip Award. Endowed Scholarship recipients receive a full scholarship to participate in the AATG Summer Study Program. This scholarship has existed since 1997 and is funded by generous donations of AATG Members and friends.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aatg.org/donations/fund.asp?id=8706&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2209">At the beginning of the [[Second World War]] the [[United Kingdom]] recognised that it would need to train a large number of pilots. A number of flying and aircrew training schools were set up across the [[British Empire]] where pilots could be trained without risk of enemy interference. The British Flying Training Schools (BFTS) were set up in the United States of America from 1941 as a result of the Lend Lease Bill.&lt;ref name=RAFOAK&gt;{{cite book|last=Denson|first=Paula|title=The Royal Air Force in Oklahoma : Lives, Loves &amp; Courage of the British Air Crews Trained in Oklahoma During World War II|year=2006|publisher=Oklahoma Heritage Association|location=Oklahoma|isbn=1885596561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76335">In the [[United States]], [[community college]]s (once commonly called [[junior college]]s), are primarily two-year [[Public university|public]] institutions of [[tertiary education]]. Many community colleges also offer remedial education, GEDs, high school degrees, technical degrees and certificates, and a limited number of 4-year degrees.

After graduating from a community college, some students transfer to a [[university]] or [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] for two to three years to complete a [[bachelor's degree]], while others enter the workforce.

In 2012–2013, 7.7 million people attended U.S. community colleges, with about 3.1 million students enrolled full-time, and about 4.6 million students enrolled part-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/Community-College-FAQs.html|title=Community College FAQs|work=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Recession]] (2007-2009), community colleges faced state budget cuts amid increases in enrollment. As a result, community colleges raised student [[tuition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3927|title=Recent Deep State Higher Education Cuts May Harm Students and the Economy for Years to Come|work=cbpp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; With enrollments decreasing, lower budgets at community colleges continues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/17/enrollment-low-stakes-are-high-community-college-learns|title=With enrollment low, stakes are high, a community college learns @insidehighered|work=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article337300/As-the-economy-improves-community-colleges-cut-costs-and-jobs.html|title=As the economy improves, community colleges cut costs and jobs|work=kansascity}}&lt;/ref&gt; with increasing reliance on [[adjunct professors]], who are generally paid significantly less, typically receive little-to-no employment benefits, and face much greater uncertainty of continued employment semester to semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/is-academia-suffering-adjunctivitis/|title=Why adjunct professors are struggling to make ends meet|work=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/175214/academias-pink-collar-workforce|title=The Pink Collar Workforce of Academia|work=thenation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisproyect.org/2008/08/06/how-the-university-works-reclaiming-the-ivory-tower/|title=How the University Works; Reclaiming the Ivory Tower|work=Louis Proyect: The Unrepentant Marxist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community colleges received attention in 2015 after President [[Barack Obama]] proposed to make community college tuition free to many residents of the United States in his [[State of the Union Address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/20/politics/state-of-the-union-address-2015-preview/|title=Obama: 'Tonight, we turn the page'|author=Eric Bradner, CNN|date=20 January 2015|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan is called "America’s College Promise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ed.gov/blog/2015/01/americas-college-promise-a-ticket-to-the-middle-class/|title=America’s College Promise: A Ticket to the Middle Class|work=ed.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908062959/http://www.ed.gov/blog/2015/01/americas-college-promise-a-ticket-to-the-middle-class/|archivedate=2015-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasfaa.org/Main/orig/2015/open/Obama_Highlights__Free__Community_College_Plan,_Tax_Reform_In_State_Of_The_Union_Address.aspx|title=Obama Highlights 'Free' Community College Plan, Tax Reform In State Of The Union Address – National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators|work=nasfaa.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511023839/http://www.nasfaa.org/Main/orig/2015/open/Obama_Highlights__Free__Community_College_Plan,_Tax_Reform_In_State_Of_The_Union_Address.aspx|archivedate=2015-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attention has brought on praise, scrutiny, and criticism of community colleges.

==Terminology and control==
Before the 1970s, community colleges were more commonly referred to as '''[[junior college]]s''', and that term is still used at some institutions and for athletics, specifically the [[NJCAA]]. However, the term "junior college" is now usually used to characterize private two-year institutions. The term "community college" has evolved to describe publicly funded two-year institutions. The main national advocacy organization for community colleges, which was founded in 1920 as the "American Association of Junior Colleges," changed its name in 1992 to the "[[American Association of Community Colleges]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About AACC: Who We Are|url=http://www.aacc.nche.edu/About/Who/Pages/default.aspx|website=American Association of Community Colleges|accessdate=12 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211170321/http://www.aacc.nche.edu/About/Who/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen and  Brawer  report on the variety of other names, such as city college, county college (in New Jersey), and branch campus.  Other common components of the school  name include  vocational, technical, [[adult education]] and technical institute.  Nicknames include "democracy's college" and "opportunity college."  &lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Cohen and Florence B. Brawer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vVbn9X6Wx6YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The American Community College]'' (4th ed. 2003) p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Californian cities as well as in other large cities such as [[Chicago]], with its [[City Colleges of Chicago]], community colleges are often called "city colleges", since they were municipally funded and designed to serve the needs of the residents of the city in which they are situated.  Also, the state's public two-year colleges are not solely found in its larger cities.

New York City's network of community colleges was established outside of the CUNY system, and only integrated into that system at the insistence of the state government. Another example is [[Westchester Community College]]. In the late 1940s, the county operated a popular vocational institute. The New York state government required that the county transform its technical institute into a community college. The county government resisted this transformation, as it would be responsible for a third of the new institution's operating costs (in contrast, the state paid for all of the technical institute's operating costs). After a series of very heated meetings, fully reported in the local press, the county was forced to conform to the state government's wishes.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

As a general rule, broad generalizations about the origins, purposes, and funding of public two-year colleges varies widely among the states and, as in the case of California, within states. Furthermore, because the vital role played by rural community colleges in preparing excess rural youth for productive careers in urban centers is not well understood by policy makers, these relatively small institutions do not receive sufficient state funding to offset their weak tax bases and, because of their relatively small size, much higher per-student costs when compared to urban community colleges. This inequity in basic institutional funding has led to the creation of such organizations as the [[Community Colleges of Appalachia]] and the tribal college association, which have sought to promote more equitable funding irrespective of an institution's size or location.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== History ==

===Early community colleges===
Before 1850, a few public institutions offered two years of college: [[Lasell Junior College]] in Auburndale, Massachusetts, and [[Vincennes University]] of Vincennes, Indiana. Helland cites a section from the 1899 Vincennes University catalog: “The Vincennes University occupies a unique position in the educational field. It is half-way between the commissioned high school and the full-fledged college: it is in fact a junior college.”&lt;ref&gt;Phillip C. Helland, ''Establishment of Public Junior and Community Colleges in Minnesota 1914–1983,'' (Saint Paul, MN: Minnesota Community College System, 1987), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the early community colleges were [[normal school]]s that prepared school teachers. Primary emphasis was placed on traditional middle class values and developing responsible citizens. As an example, Normal Schools began in the State of Massachusetts in the 1880s as extensions of local high schools. They were originated to meet the need for teacher preparation.  For example, in Saint Joseph, Missouri, a Normal School was added to the local high school to provide a career track for women who wanted to teach. Mr. Whiteford, the area’s district superintendent, inquired of the University of Missouri to determine if credits from Saint Joseph Normal School could transfer into a baccalaureate program. The University’s President Dr. Hill acknowledged the request and provided for the articulation. Coincidentally, Dr. Hill was actively involved in the American Association of Universities and calling for the establishment of junior colleges for this purpose. In Minnesota, St. Paul’s Public School District established a “City Training School” for preparing teachers.&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Wright, “Annual Report of the Superintendent,” Annual Report of the Board of Education. Saint Paul, MN: Globe Office. June 1883, 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1883 school’s mission was to provide certified teachers and substitutes for the district. Mrs. M. E. Jenness from the Normal School at River Falls, Wisconsin, was the St. Paul School’s first principal; Mrs. N. F. Wheaton was the Director of Practice. Wheaton had been employed at the Oshkosh Normal School in Wisconsin. In Minneapolis, a Normal Training School was instituted in the fall of 1887. Miss Adele Evers of Manchester Normal School in New Hampshire was appointed the first teacher; she was one of six candidates for the position.  Evers’ references included work at Martha’s Vineyard and Saratoga.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Bradley, “Superintendent’s Report,” The Tenth Annual Report of the Board of Education of the City of Minneapolis, Minneapolis: Tribune Job Printing Company. June 30, 1887, 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baltimore’s Manual Training High School opened in 1884, was the first separate secondary school for education that was specifically work orientated.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Dooley, Industrial Education, (Cambridge: Riverside Press, 1919)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maryland institution was unique as a stand-alone campus. Other examples of sub-baccalaureate programs were the University Preparatory School and Junior College of Tonkawa. The result of the two- year schools founded in Oklahoma Public School Secondary System in 1902, both institutions later merged in 1914 and became the Oklahoma Institute of Technology. Dean Schneider of the University of Cincinnati developed an alternative high school with a cooperative plan where students spent one week in an occupation and the other in school. Industry provided the shop experiences and the classroom facilitated the academic.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Prosser and Charles A. Allen. Vocational Education in a Democracy. (New York: The Century Co., 1925), 225&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also non-cooperative high schools; two examples were the Girl’s Vocational High School in Kansas City, Missouri and the Delgado Trade School in New Orleans. A two-year, terminal education, was seen as more socially efficient for students who could advance past high school but not continue to attain bachelor's degrees. This national vocational movement gave junior colleges a target population, but numerous students wanted more than a semiprofessional education; many maintained a desire to transfer. Throughout this time period, there was a move for more public two-year institutions along with a trend to separate from high schools and affiliate with higher education. With the change in affiliation came a new status which encouraged junior colleges to develop additional credibility through the creation of professional criteria and use of scientific methods.

Brint and Karabel conclude that, “The two-year college has been a distinctively American creation, and nowhere else has it attained such prominence.”&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Brint and Jerome Karabel, ''The Diverted Dream: Community Colleges and the Promise of Educational Opportunity in America, 1900–1985'' (Oxford University Press, 1989), p 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  J. L. Ratcliff.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Ratcliff “Seven Streams in the Historical Development of the Modern American Community College” in ''A Handbook Of The Community College In America'' Ed. George A. Baker III (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; suggests one perspective for the emergence of two-year post secondary institutions of the past century: they began in the private sector after the [[Panic of 1893]]. At that time of severe financial hardship J. M. Carroll, president of Baylor University, made a pragmatic suggestion to solve the problem of too many Baptist colleges with insufficient funds and not enough students to support them: reduce the smaller Baptist colleges’ curriculum to the freshman and sophomore years. After this preliminary period, Baylor University would accept the two-year students and provide the junior and senior years of their academic plan. Carroll hoped this split would require fewer faculty and resources for the first two years of higher education.

In the larger cities early public community colleges were often an extension of [[high school]]s, like the first established, [[Joliet Junior College]], in Illinois in 1901. These initial community colleges generally were small (usually fewer than 200 students) and focused on a liberal arts education with the goal of [[college transfer|transferring]] students to four-year colleges. They reflected high school needs and lacked a definite identity. These examples of two-year structure innovations with transfer missions in the private and public sector provided a pragmatic approach for the preservation of existing institutions.

Junior colleges grew from 20 in number In 1909, to 170 in 1919. By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each.  Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students.  The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges in all; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) p 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Many factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white collar labor force, as well as for more advanced technical jobs in the blue collar sphere. Four years colleges were also growing, albeit not as fast; however many of them were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis.

Several different movements supported the creation of community colleges, including local community support of public and private two-year institutions, the expansion of the public education system, increased professional standards for teachers, the vocational education movement, and an expanding demand for adult and community education. Numerous colleges and universities advocated for the development of junior colleges. Leadership felt small, private liberal arts colleges and high schools could provide the first two years of college while larger universities could focus resources on research and junior and senior level students.

===Depression era===

During the 1920s and 1930s there was a shift in the purpose of community colleges to developing a workforce, which was influenced by wide unemployment during the [[Great Depression]]. Developing "semiprofessionals" became dominant national language to describe junior college students. The notion that engineers and supervisors make primary decisions about what and how activities were to be done in the workplace provided the origins for employees needed to carry out their decisions. This need for a class of workers to implement the decisions of the theoreticians demanded an educational delivery system other than the traditional four-year college or university. The closed shop of the artisan which had initially provided workers was no longer the educational program of choice. Nationally, a new two-year vehicle for educating the industrial worker found its launching within the secondary public school system under the leadership of local school districts.

===Cold War era===
After [[World War II]], the [[G.I. Bill]] afforded more educational opportunity to veterans which resulted in increased enrollments. Another factor that led to growth was the rise of adult and community education. After World War II, community colleges were seen as a good place to house continuing education programs. The 1947 [[President's Commission on Higher Education]] was an important national document for community colleges. It established a network of public community colleges that would provide education to a diverse group of students at little or no cost along with serving community needs through a comprehensive mission.

This national network exploded in the 1960s with 457 community colleges and the enrollment of [[baby boomer]]s. A series of grants through the Kellogg Junior College Leadership Programs helped train many community college leaders during this decade.

[[Merritt College]], a junior college (and now a community college) in Oakland, California, was the site for organizing and educating members of the [[Black Panthers]] in the mid- to late-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=CKFlirjb2EAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=merritt+college+black+panthers&amp;ots=wlGhvbc7uz&amp;sig=msdcNkt3NvXVXcQl5qA4X0DscR8#v=onepage&amp;q=merritt%20college%20black%20panthers&amp;f=false|title=Black Against Empire|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/facpub/479/|title="The Black Panther Party's Narratives of Resistance" by David Ray Papke|work=marquette.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jsh/summary/v042/42.1.rogers.html|title=Project MUSE – The Marginalization of the Black Campus Movement|work=jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, growth continued when many enrolled to escape the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam era draft]]. The 1970s also marked a shift to faculty development, including more instructional training for the unique student body and mission of community colleges. In 1976, Coastline Community College was launched as the first "college without walls," using television, a precursor today's online programs as well as using community facilities. During the 1980s, community colleges began to work more closely with high schools to prepare students for vocational and technical two-year programs.

By the end of the 20th century, two-year community colleges were playing important roles in higher education as access mechanisms. They became an integral feature for those persons who were attending higher education for the first time or as non-traditional students. Brint and Karabel&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Brint and Jerome Karabel, The Diverted Dream: Community Colleges and the Promise of Educational Opportunity in America, 1900–1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  have recognized the change that transpired from 1920 when fewer than 2 percent of all college freshmen were enrolled in a two-year college to the late 1980s when over 50 percent were matriculated. Junior colleges once located in high schools had left their origins to develop their own campuses and were called community colleges and still retained the transfer access mission. High school normal schools matured into teacher colleges or colleges of education within universities offering bachelor and graduate degrees. Industrial institutes integrated with local junior colleges to make these campus’s programs more comprehensive community colleges. Along with this growth and legitimization of two-year mechanisms for the delivery of higher education, the emergence of two-year institutions provided an epistemological debate that divided the river of education flowing into the early 20th century into three streams of educational natures. “In the process of this struggle and adjustment some colleges will grow stronger, some will become academies, some junior colleges; the high schools will be elevated to a still more important position than that which they now occupy. The general result will be the growth of a system in the higher educational work of the United States, where now no system exists.”&lt;ref&gt;William Rainey Harper, The Prospects of the Small College. (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1900), 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s and 2000s===
In recent history, a debate between the advocates and critics of community colleges gained strength. Advocates argued that community colleges served the needs of society by providing college opportunity to students who [[Post Secondary Transition For High School Students with Disabilities|otherwise cannot go to college]], training and retraining mid-level [[skilled worker]]s, and preserving the academic excellence of four-year universities. Critics argued that community colleges continued a culture of privilege through training business workers at public expense, not allowing the working class to advance in social class, protecting selective admissions at four-year institutions for the nation's elite, and discouraging transfer through [[cooling out]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Clark |first=Burton R. |year=1960 |title=The "cooling-out" function in higher education |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=569–575 |doi=10.1086/222787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the growth of community colleges has stabilized, enrollment continued to outgrow four-year institutions. A total of 1,166 loosely linked community colleges face challenges of new technological innovations, distance learning, funding constraints, community pressure, and international influence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Some of the issues currently faced are explored in [http://www.acteonline.org/resource_center/rch/Community-College-Issues.cfm community college resources]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} compiled by the [[Association for Career and Technical Education]].

===2010s (The Great Recession and austerity)===

In the 2010s, funding for community colleges faced scrutiny{{From whom?|date=February 2015}} as state budgets were tightened. Because higher education budgets are considered discretionary expenses, they have been more likely targets for cuts than K-12 education or [[Medicaid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304250204579431002568739162|title=Review: Degrees of Inequality – WSJ|author=Barton Swaim|date=13 March 2014|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, however, the state of Tennessee and the city of Chicago, Illinois began programs for free community college.{{Clarify|date=February 2015}} In 2015, President [[Barack Obama]] proposed a plan for free &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.communitycollegereview.com/blog/is-president-obamas-plan-for-free-community-college-right-for-america|title=Is President Obama's Plan for Free Community College Right for America?|author=Grace Chen|date= 28 February 2018|work=Community College Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; community colleges, where states would contribute a portion of the funding.

Two states have taken measures to provide free community college to students. “Oregon now is poised to follow Tennessee as the second state with a plan on the books to provide free two-year college” &lt;ref name="Free Community College Catches On"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fain|first1=P|title=Free Community College Catches On|date=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Oregon Promise, similar to America’s College Promise, will provide free community college to students who meet certain eligibility requirements.  According to Fain, the legislation will cost Oregon $10 million per year to pay for tuition costs state and federal aid doesn’t cover. Thanks to a large increase in funding for higher education, Oregon is able to financially afford the costs of providing free community college to students. While only two states have made strides in providing a free community college education, White House representatives want to see more states support the initiative.&lt;ref name="Free Community College Catches On"/&gt;

The state of Tennessee currently has the Tennessee Promise, but this initiative does not receive its funding in the same manner in which President Obama wants to fund U.S. College Promise (Mangan &amp; Supiano, 2015). Following in the footsteps of Tennessee and Oregon is Illinois. The Community College of Philadelphia and Harper College in Illinois recently announced its plans to provide free two-year community college experiences to students (Fain, 2015).&lt;ref name="Free Community College Catches On"/&gt;

==Adjunct faculty and contingent labor==
Adjunct faculty, a form of contingent labor, make up most of the instructional staff at community colleges.  Adjunct pay ranges from about $1,397 to about $3,000 per course. While the community college instructional staff is diverse, some community college teachers are "freeway flyers" who work at multiple campuses to make a living. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://work.chron.com/average-adjunct-pay-community-colleges-18310.html|title=The Average Adjunct Pay at Community Colleges|work=Work - Chron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==

&lt;big&gt;'''State governance'''&lt;/big&gt;

The higher education governance structure landscape in the United States is very diverse; they are not intended to be precise organization charts. According to the Education Commission of the States there are three major types of higher education governance systems in the states; they are Governing Board States, Coordinating Board States and Planning/ Regulatory/Service Agency States. (from: [http://www.ecs.org The Education Commission of the States website])

'''Governing board states (GBS)'''

State-level governing boards are distinguished according to whether they are responsible for consolidated systems or multi-campus systems. Consolidated systems are composed of several previously independently governed institutions that were later consolidated into one system. Multi-campus systems developed primarily through extensions of various branches or campuses.

'''Coordinating board states'''

Coordinating boards vary significantly in formal authority and informal power and influence from state to state.  Generally, there is a state level board governing universities, colleges, and community colleges.  Each university and community college district will have its own board that is accountable to a state-coordinating agency.

'''The Planning/Regulatory/Service Agency States (PRSA)'''

The PRSA states have limited or non-existent formal governing or coordinating authority, which carry out regulatory and service functions such as student financial aid.

For a comprehensive list of American community colleges and their state level governing boards:  ''[http://www.utexas.edu/world/comcol/state U.S. Community Colleges by State, University of Texas at Austin]''

A more thorough description of state level college and university governance models can be found at: ''Models of Postsecondary Education Coordination and Governance in the States''

&lt;big&gt;'''Local governance'''&lt;/big&gt;

Most community colleges are operated within special districts that draw property tax revenue from the local community, as a division of a state university, or as a sister institution within a statewide higher education system.

In all cases, community colleges are governed by a board of trustees, appointed by the state governor, or the board is elected by citizens residing within the community college district. In some instances, as with the City Colleges of Chicago, the board of trustees is appointed by the presiding local government.  In Chicago, it is the mayor who appoints the board.

Depending on the operational system, the board of trustees may directly govern the college or may govern the college through a university or system-level office. Depending upon the locus of control, the board may or may not be subject to control by a state agency that supervises all community college districts or all higher education institutions within the state.

The board of trustees selects a president or chancellor of the community college to serve as the chief executive officer and lead the faculty and staff.

&lt;big&gt;'''Multi-college district'''&lt;/big&gt;

Multi-college community college districts include several individually accredited community colleges within one district.  Each college is independent with distinct local administration, but they share a single board of trustees and report to a non-instructional central administrative office.

The Contra Costa Community College District is an example of one of the largest multi-college community college districts in California. The District consists of Contra Costa College, Diablo Valley College, Los Medanos College, San Ramon Campus, and Brentwood Center, and annually serves almost 62,000 students.

&lt;big&gt;'''Multi-campus district'''&lt;/big&gt;

Larger schools implement a multi-campus system and generally share a single accreditation.  Local administrative governance varies. Extension campuses report to the main campus administration or a central administrative office.  A good example of this is [[College of DuPage]] in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, which has 6 satellite campuses within a 10-mile area, in addition to its main campus, which itself has 9 structures and an enrollment of over 30,000 students.

&lt;big&gt;'''Faculty governance'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Faculty senates and councils'''

A faculty senate, or faculty council as this body is sometimes referred to, is the representative body of all faculty who participate in the governance processes of the community college. As with all governing bodies, the faculty senate is usually governed by a constitution and a set of bylaws specific to the college.  Membership in this body varies from college, with most restricting voting rights to tenured and tenure track faculty, and others allowing a wider array of members to include full-time, adjunct, continuing education, technical, and adult basic education faculty. (modified from: http://www.pima.edu/facsenate/)

Though this is not an exhaustive list, the mission of the faculty senate at the community college usually includes: matters concerning curricular decisions; strengthening the concept of the faculty as a college entity; promoting the gathering, exchanging, and disseminating of faculty views and concerns regarding college matters; promoting mutual accountability between the college faculty and the faculty representative to any college committee; advising the Chancellor and other administrators of faculty views on college matters; bringing the concerns of the Chancellor and other administrators on college matters to the faculty; promoting the involvement of all faculty members in the establishing, staffing, and functioning of college committees, task forces, or other initiatives; and participating in the policy review process of the college.

&lt;big&gt;'''Collective bargaining units/agreements'''&lt;/big&gt;

Most community college faculty are bargained for employees.  While unions and their respective collective bargaining agreements serve to protect faculty rights and working conditions, collective bargaining agreements, or union contracts, provide faculty with a defined set of rules and regulations they must follow as a condition of employment.
Collective bargaining swept into higher education on the coattails of legislation authorizing public employees to negotiate. As these laws were passed in various states in the 1960s and 1970s, employee groups ranging from refuse collectors to prison guards gained union representation and began negotiating contracts (Cohen &amp; Brawer, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;147)

Collective bargaining units exist for all divisions of community college faculty; however, participation by faculty groups differs from college to college.

&lt;big&gt;'''Student governance'''&lt;/big&gt;

There is a student government organizational presence on close to every community college campus in America The Student Government organization is the official voice of the student body, a vital link in effective student participation in all areas of student concern in relationship to the college’s administration. By advocating student rights and services, the organization represents the student body and presents its concerns to the college administration, local, and national issues.  Through the Student Government organizations the college provides students with essential leadership experience, and valuable connections with faculty, staff administration, students, and the Board of Trustees.  Student involvement is usually based on criteria set by the institution; all students have the right as a student to participate in democratic process on campus. (from [http://www.asgaonline.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=SGDB02&amp;mod=SG+Database%3A%3ASGDB02+-+SG+Details&amp;mid=68BCEFA4D2534435852F8A4C82C52108&amp;tier=3&amp;id=5C55958317E64A358D4A063D53867385 ASGA's entry of Bakersfield College])

&lt;big&gt;'''Shared governance'''&lt;/big&gt;

Shared governance is the set of practices under which college faculty and staff participates in significant decisions concerning the operation of their institutions. Colleges are very special types of institutions with a unique mission—the creation and dissemination of ideas. At the heart of shared governance is the belief that decision-making should be largely independent of short-term managerial and political considerations.  Faculty and professional staff are in the best position to shape and implement curriculum and research policy, to select academic colleagues and judge their work; and The perspective of all front-line personnel is invaluable in making sound decisions about allocating resources, setting goals, choosing top officers and guiding student life.

For a more detailed explanation of governance at the community college, please see the AAUP’s 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities and the 1998 statement on the same topic by the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges.  These documents more clearly define those matters that are the responsibility of the voting faculty and those reserved to the governing body and its delegates. (From: http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2002/JA/Feat/Luce.htm)

== Enrollment ==
In the United States, community colleges operate under a policy of "open admission." That is, anyone with a [[high school diploma]] or [[General Educational Development|GED]] may attend, regardless of prior academic status or [[college entrance exam]] scores. Although community colleges have an open admission policy, students have to take [[placement testing|placement tests]] before enrolling at the college, due to not all courses being open admission. In California and Minnesota, students who have reached the age of 18 are not required to have completed secondary education; instead, they must simply show an "[[ability to benefit]]" from a college's educational program. Under certain circumstances, community colleges will also accept high school students or dropouts.

The open admission policy results in a wide range of students attending community college classes. Students range in age from teenagers in [[high school]] taking classes under a concurrent, or dual, enrollment policy (which allows both high school and college credits to be earned simultaneously) to working adults taking classes at night to complete a degree or gain additional skills in their field to students with graduate degrees who enroll to become more employable or to pursue lifelong interests. "Reverse transfers" (or those transferring from a university) constitute one of the fastest growing new community college cohorts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

One threat to enrollment at community colleges has been the increasing popularity of for-profit e-learning and online universities, such as the [[University of Phoenix]], now the 16th-largest university in the world. Higher education research and consulting firm [[Eduventures]] estimates that 10 percent of college students will be enrolled in an online degree program by 2008&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Daniel.  "Online University Enrollment Soars" [[The Wall Street Journal]]. 15 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many community colleges have supplemented their offerings with online courses to stave off competition from exclusively e-learning schools. For example, [[Northern Virginia Community College]]'s Extended Learning Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eli.nvcc.edu|title=Extended Learning Institute :: Northern Virginia Community College|author=Northern Virginia Community College|work=nvcc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been offering distance learning courses for thirty-five years. Texas offers the [http://www.vct.org/ Virtual College of Texas] whereby a student at any community college in the state can attend classes from any of the state's 51 community colleges or four [[Texas State Technical College]] campuses, paying local tuition plus a VCT fee of around $40.

The [[Maricopa County Community College District]] in the [[Phoenix, Arizona]] metropolitan area, is the largest community college district in the United States in terms of enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MCCCD Official Website|url=http://www.maricopa.edu/about/?demographics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California has the lowest community college enrollment fees in the nation, currently set at $46 per [[Credit hour|unit]] for state residents.

When it comes to employment status the two highest populations are full-time students with part-time jobs and part-time students with full-time jobs.  This is likely due to the necessity of work/school balance.  As Katz and Davison (2014) state, “…community college students are more likely to be working class, ethnic minorities, over age 25, and from less educated families than traditional university students” (p.&amp;nbsp;308).&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D.

Among four-year institutions, transfer students have better outcomes at public institutions, very selective institutions, and institutions with students of higher SES. Average Bachelor's completion rates are 10% higher for students that transferred to public four-year institutions than those who transferred to private non-profit four-year institutions. Community college students who transferred to very selective four-year institutions had bachelor’s completion rates that were on average 36 percentage points higher than those of students who transferred to non-selective institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED563499.pdf|title=Tracking Transfer: New Measures of Institutional and State Effectiveness in Helping Community College Students Attain Bachelor's Degrees.|last=Jenkins|first=Davis|date=2016|website=Community College Research Center, Teachers College, Columbia University.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational offerings ==
Community colleges generally offer a range of programs.

===Associate degree===
In study towards an [[associate degree]], a student takes necessary courses needed to earn a degree that will allow for entry into jobs requiring some level of college education but not a full four-year degree. The associate degree program also allows students who wish to eventually obtain a [[bachelor's degree]] at a four-year college to complete the necessary "core" requirements to attend the college of their choice. Some states have mandated that the community college's curriculum be structured so as to satisfy "core curriculum" requirements at the state's public universities or private universities.

Many community colleges have [[Articulation (education)|articulation]] arrangements with nearby four-year institutions, where a student obtaining an associate degree in a field will automatically have his/her classes counted toward the bachelor's degree requirement. For example, a community college associate degree in hotel and restaurant management, computers or accounting would count toward the four-year school's core requirement for a Business Administration degree. Some have gone one step further by arrangements with a four-year college for the student to obtain the bachelor's degree from the four-year college while taking all the courses via [[distance learning]] or other non-traditional modes, thus reducing the number of physical visits to the four-year school. One such example is [[College of DuPage]] (COD) in Illinois, who have implemented a program called 3+1. In this program, students can take three years of classes at the community college taught by COD professors and faculty, and in the fourth year attend classes on the COD campus, but taught by professors of nearby partner universities, such as [[Benedictine University]], [[Concordia University]], [[Governors State University]], [[Lewis University]], and [[Roosevelt University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cod.edu/academics/transfer_programs/3plus1.aspx|title=College of DuPage – 3+1 Degree Programs – Earn Your Bachelor's Degree|work=cod.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certification===
Certification in an area of [[training]] (such as [[Licensed Practical Nurse|nursing]], [[computer repair]], [[allied health]], [[Police|law enforcement]], [[firefighting]], or [[welding]]), which require preparation for a state or national examination, or where certification would allow for hiring preference or a higher salary upon entering the workforce. These courses are often geared toward the needs of the local or area business community.

===Local services===
Services of local interest to members of the community, such as job placement, adult continuing education classes (either for personal achievement or to maintain certification in specialized fields), and developmental classes for children. Some community colleges offer opportunities for high school dropouts to return to school and earn a high school diploma or obtain a GED.

=== Bachelor's degrees ===

A growing trend in the United States is for community colleges to begin offering bachelor's degrees. As of 2013, nineteen states have authorized their community colleges to offer bachelor's degrees with California passing authorizing legislation in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accbd.org/resources/baccalaureate-conferring-locations/?ct=US|title=Baccalaureate Conferring Locations|author=|publisher=Community College Baccalaureate Association|date=October 2013|accessdate=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/29/the-10-000-community-college-ba|title=The $10,000 Community College B.A.: California is the latest state to allow community colleges to offer select bachelor's degree programs.|author= Allie Bidwell|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=2014-09-29|accessdate=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many large community colleges, such as [[Miami-Dade College]] and [[St. Petersburg College]], in [[Florida]] have even completely dropped the words "community" or "junior" from their names as they have added bachelor's degree programs in limited fields and have started their evolution into four-year colleges while retaining their local commitments. Even some smaller community colleges, such as [[Northern New Mexico College]] in [[Española, New Mexico]], have dropped community from their names and now offer six or more bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnmc.edu/about/BaccalaureatePrograms.shtml]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509161917/http://www.nnmc.edu/about/BaccalaureatePrograms.shtml|date=May 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the larger institutions, such as [[De Anza College]] in northern California and [[College of DuPage]] near Chicago, who both boast enrollment of over 25,000 students, continue to explore the [[cost-benefit analysis]] in offering 4-year degrees.  In more rural communities, community colleges may host branches of the local state university, and community colleges with specialized programs may offer four-year degrees in conjunction with other schools, some miles away. For instance, [[Southern Illinois University]] offers aviation management bachelor's degrees at [[Mt. San Antonio College]] and [[Palomar College]] in Southern California.

== Advantages of community colleges ==
* Community colleges emphasize the needs of local students and the local job market. Students who could not afford campus or off-site housing at a four-year college, or for other reasons cannot relocate, can attend courses while staying in their local community (though some colleges do offer student housing). They can even benefit university graduates, since some four-year schools fail to prepare their graduates for the kinds of jobs that are available in their surrounding regions. Over seven percent of the nation's community college students already possess a bachelor's degree. At some colleges, the figure is close to twenty percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Although an [[associate degree]] is typically less financially lucrative in the long term than a bachelor's degree, it can still provide a respectable income at much less cost in time, tuition, student loans, and lost earnings, along with the option of upgrading to a bachelor's degree at a later time. Even ten years after graduation, there are many people with certificates and associate degrees in fields where they earn more money than the average B.A. holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Community college professors may be solely dedicated to teaching, and classes may be small. In comparison, a large university college course may be taught to 300+ students by a teaching assistant, while the professor attends to research duties {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}. Outside of those teaching in the technical and vocational fields, most instructors at community colleges have [[master's degree]]s and many hold [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degrees. In addition, community college professors can help students achieve their goals, work more closely with them, and offer them support, while at four-year colleges and universities, a professor is also often expected to conduct academic research, and in some cases, to mentor [[graduate students]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Agrawal|first=Chad|title=Community College Transfer|url=http://www.communitycollegetransferstudents.com|work=Community College Transfer Students|accessdate=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A number of community colleges have athletic programs; certain colleges also serve as incubators for college athletes, particularly in [[baseball]], [[basketball]] and [[college football|football]]. A talented player who would not meet the academic or athletic standards of a major college program may be able to play for two years in junior college, establishing an academic record in the process, and then transfer to the major college.&lt;ref name=NYT-powell-042207&gt;Robert Andrew Powell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/education/edlife/sport22.html?ref=edlife Community College: Tennis in a Parking Lot], ''The New York Times'', April 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages of community colleges ==
* Transferring [[Credit (education)|credits]] can sometimes be a problem, as each four-year college has its own requirements for enrollment. However, many four-year colleges (usually near the community college) have made arrangements, known as articulation agreements, allowing associate degrees to qualify for transfer, some cases allowing the student to complete the bachelor's degree via [[distance learning]] from the community college campus. Some states have passed rules whereby certain associate degrees in a field will automatically transfer to state universities as the core curriculum for specified bachelor's degrees.  [[Minnesota]], Alabama, and Oregon have created a statewide "transfer curriculum" allowing credits to be transferred to any other public university and almost all of the private colleges. The North Carolina system has a similar agreement, whereby specific courses are designated for mandatory transfer credit to all statewide public four-year institutions. Illinois's [http://www.itransfer.org/ I-transfer program] program aids students in transferring credits across the state. California has a system known as Assist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assist.org/|title=Welcome to ASSIST|work=assist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which labels course equivalencies between all California Community Colleges and California public four-year colleges. Texas has a similar system known as [http://www.tccns.org/ TCCN] for labelling course equivalencies between all Texas Community Colleges and Texas public four-year institutions. 
* It is frequent for many courses to be taught by part-time [[lecturer]]s, [[Adjunct professors|adjuncts]], or [[contingent labor]], some with only a bachelor's degree in the field. Research conducted by the University of Washington's Labor Center suggests that community colleges' reliance on part-time (adjunct) faculty results in lower graduation rates than colleges with a full-time workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/10/16/parttime|title=Adjuncts and Graduation Rates|work=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to federal statistics, 42% of public community college freshmen take remedial courses, and further studies show that 79% of remedial courses are taught by part-time faculty.&lt;ref name=NYT-Merrow3-042207&gt;John Merrow, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/education/edlife/22merrow-profile-3.html Community Colleges: A Harsh Reality], ''The New York Times'', April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Research shows that individuals with associate degrees usually earn less than those with bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Personal income in the United States]] – chart on income by educational attainment.&lt;/ref&gt;
* While community colleges are open enrollment institutions, meaning they accept and enroll all prospective students as long as fees are paid and the student enrolls in classes, this open door policy is often seen as a revolving door, with many students, nearly 2/3 not completing their education.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, G. R. (2011). The American community college: From access to 	success. About Campus, 16(2), 2–10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* There is a historic connotation that community colleges and [[for-profit colleges]] are often considered schools of last resort, because of their open-admissions policies, which may reflect poorly upon students who were unable to receive admission to a college offering a wider variety of degree programs.&lt;ref name=NYT-Frerking-042207&gt;Beth Frerking, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/education/edlife/bestccs.html Community Colleges: For Achievers, a New Destination], ''The New York Times'', April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Their open-admissions policies have been the subject of sarcastic humor in popular media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phil McGraw]], ''Love Smart: Find the One You Want, Fix the One You Got'' (New York: Free Press, 2005), 41. Dr. Phil remarks, "You need to put up some fences around yourself, lady. You may be easier to get into than a community college. Have some boundaries."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comprehensive community colleges==
Many schools have adapted the term ''comprehensive'' to describe their institutions. These schools typically offer six facets of education: 
# Transfer education – The traditional two-year student who will then transfer to a four-year institution to pursue a BS/BA degree.
# Career education – The traditional two-year student that will graduate with an associate degree and directly enter the workforce.
# Developmental – Remedial education for high school graduates who are not academically ready to enroll in college-level courses.
# Continuing – Non-Credit courses offered to the community for personal development and interest.
# Industry training – Contracted training and education wherein a local company pays the college to provide specific training or courses for their employees.
# eLearning – Distance learning occurs online using one's computer and proctored exams. Pell grants and federal aid apply to eLearning also. For example, studying Spanish in an eLearning environment is possible when a student is in another state and federal aid is applied to out-of-state tuition.

Within the transfer education category, comprehensive schools typically have [[Articulation (education)|articulation]] agreements in place that provide prearranged acceptance into specific four-year institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associate Degree for Transfer|url=http://californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/Students/AssociateDegreeforTransfer.aspx|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some community colleges, the partnering four-year institution teaches the third and fourth year courses at the community college location and thereby allows a student to obtain a four-year degree without having to physically move to the four-year school.

There are institutions and organizations which provide community college research to inform practice and policy.

Heim, "Disposed to Consolidation and Innovation: Criteria for the Community College Specialization." ''Community and Junior College Libraries'' 3 (Summer 1985): 5–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Remediation ==

Remediation, or sometimes referred to as developmental education, is a format of education aimed to help open doors for students by reinforcing or re-teaching them core skills. This educational strategy is utilized so students can meet competencies in various academic arenas and further progress in their academics. Remediation is prominent in community colleges, a type of two-year colleges, as these institutions are designed to accommodate students of various levels of academic abilities. Community college students are placed into remedial coursework according to their performance on placement-based testing they take prior to beginning classes.

=== Assignment ===

The push in shifting students to enroll in remedial courses at community colleges stems from philosophical beliefs and reputations that these are the most appropriate places for instruction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tinto|first1=Vincent|title=Learning communities and the reconstruction of remedial education in higher education|journal=Paper presented at the Conference of Replacing Remediation in Higher Education at Stanford University|url=https://vtinto.expressions.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Developmental-Education-Learning-Communities.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bettinger|first1=Eric|last2=Long|first2=Bridget|title=Remediation at the community college: Student participation and outcomes|journal=New Directions for Community Colleges|date=2005|volume=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; All community colleges have developmental or remedial courses of some kind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMillan|first1=Virginia|last2=Parke|first2=Scott|last3=Lanning|first3=Carol|title=Remedial/developmental  education approaches for the current community college environment|journal=New Directions for Community Colleges|date=1997|volume=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 42 percent of first-year students attending two-year colleges in the United States sign up for remedial courses, twice as many as those at four-year universities or colleges.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callahan|first1=M.

=== Successful approaches ===
Scholars recommend that community colleges can enhance their remedial education programs through utilizing a variety of methods. Community colleges are suggested to allow students to have the option of taking other courses, in addition to remedial courses, so they may feel like they are making progress with their programs.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Should remediation be mandatory in the  community college?|last = Zeitlin|first = Arthur N.|date = 1996|journal = Community Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Markus|first2 = Theodore C.|volume = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution of learning communities at community colleges may be challenging due to the nature of these students coming to and leaving campus often, but they have been helpful for remedial students at other postsecondary educations in facilitating friendships, improved studying patterns, and higher rates of passing courses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Faculty -- based advising: An important factor in community  college retention.|last = McArthur|first = Ronald C.|date = 2005|journal = Community College Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|volume = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology-enhanced classrooms, complete with SmartBoards, computers and online networks, can increase the level of motivation that remedial community college students place toward their academic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A space for writing: Developmental writing instruction in a technology-enhanced classroom|last = David|first = Denise L.|date = 2008|journal = Research &amp; Teaching in Developmental Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Keaton|first2 = Rebekah|last3 = Morris|first3 = Robert|last4 = Murphy|first4 = James G.|last5 = Stapley|first5 = Ian|issue = 2|volume = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remedial students obtaining academic assistance via college writing centers can also be helpful for enhancing their skills, as well as observing the interdisciplinary nature of classroom concepts and learning strategies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://doi.org/10.2307/358861|title = "Our little secret": A history of writing centers, pre- to post-open admissions|last = Boquet|first = Elizabeth H.|date = 1999|journal = College Composition and Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 3|volume = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
Effective and passionate instructors can provide remedial students with social capital, leading them to services ranging from tutoring and counseling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Students in remedial courses often end of performing “better than college-prepared students in terms of their grade point average, retention, and program completion.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Remedial students who attend community college orientations and receive more contact with tutoring, advising and mentoring services find these options to be rewarding.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Those who complete remedial courses before college level courses often experience more benefits, including higher grade point averages, compared to their counterparts who do not take these remedial courses early in their college careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Influence of a community college developmental education writing course on academic performance|last = Crews|first = Denise M.|date = 2004|journal = Community College Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 32|issue = 2|last2 = Aragon|first2 = Steven R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disadvantages and criticisms ===
Some students are placed into remedial courses, even when they only have minor issues, leading them to need to pass and complete remedial courses before being able to enroll in a basic course for that subject area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Likewise, some students are restricted from taking classes in other disciplines, such as physical sciences, until they complete developmental sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The experience of community college for developmental students: challenges and motivations|last = VanOra|first = Jason|journal = Community College Enterprise|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who take remedial courses may not have these count as college credits, and these students may be more likely to complete fewer college credits overall or stop out of college.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Many community college instructors of remedial courses are part-time faculty members, which can prove challenging to students who require more assistance and contact.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While some scholars debate whether money should be allocated toward remedial education, opponents argue that withholding these opportunities also has a direct impact on the quality of employees in the workforce if they continue to lack essential skills.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5526">'''Constança Capdeville''' (16 March 1937{{spaced ndash}}4 February 1992) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] pianist, percussionist, music educator and composer.

==Early years==
Constança Capdeville was born in [[Barcelona]] and lived in the village of [[Caxias, Oeiras|Caxias]] as a child. She came from an artistic family and in her youth was exposed to creative geniuses including [[Salvador Dalí]]. She wrote piano compositions at an early age, and studied piano and composition at the [[Lisbon Conservatorio Nacional]], where she received a diploma in [[Higher Education]] in Music.&lt;ref name=Sadie /&gt;

After completing her studies in Barcelona, Capdeville settled in Portugal in 1951. She pursued further studies in piano with [[Varela Cid]] and musical composition with [[Jorge Croner de Vasconcellos]]. She then specialized her education in music to the study of ancient music ([[paleography]]/transcribing, [[organology]], [[clavichord]] and [[performance practice]]) with [[Macário Santiago Kastner]].

==Biography==
After completing her musical studies, Capdeville taught music at the National Conservatory and the New University of [[Lisbon]]. She was a member of the Portuguese Council of Music and the Catalan Composers Association of Barcelona. She won the Portuguese Medal of Cultural Merit in 1990, and the Insignia of the Order of Santiago da Espada posthumously in 1992.&lt;ref name=Sadie&gt;{{cite book |title=The new Grove dictionary of music and musicians: Volume 14|first=Stanley|last=Sadie|first2=John|last2=Tyrrell|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capdeville was a prolific composer. By 1969 she had begun to have her works commissioned by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] for its orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mic.pt/noticias?where=8&amp;what=3&amp;id=81&amp;lang=EN|title=Constança Capdeville|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She produced approximately 100 pieces for orchestra, chamber ensembles and a variety of soloists using different instruments. She also composed music for films and plays, ballet/dance and 'dramatized' staged performances. From early on, her music revealed close ties to the [[dramatic arts]] and to the imagery of the human condition evoked though sound and [[Mise en scène]].

Capdeville's compositions were laden with multiple artistic perception. During her life, she was a close artistic and personal friend of music genius [[Jorge Peixinho]] who had himself been a towering influence upon the contemporary [[Portugal]] of the latter half of the 20th century. Capdeville was also a talented percussionist, but as a musician her main instrument was the piano.

Besides the conservatory, she taught at the [[:pt:Escola superior de música de lisboa|Escola Superior de Música de Lisboa]] and at the ''[[Academia de Musica de Santa Cecilia]]'' in Lisbon. She also taught in the Musicology department of the 'Universidade Nova de Lisboa' ([[New University of Lisbon]]) 's Faculty of Humanities ( UNL- FCSH ). In this position, she taught a number of students who went on to prominence in music and composition and went on to receive prestigious national and international awards. These students include [[Eurico Carrapatoso]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.editions-bim.com/composers/carrapatoso-eurico|title=Eurico Carrapatoso|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capdeville died of [[cancer]] February 4, 1992, at the age of 55 in her hometown of Caxias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music-timeline.net/20th-c/1992a|title=Music timeline|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Capdeville composed about a hundred works, including orchestral music, theater works and film soundtracks. Selected works include:

*''Diferenças Sobre o Intervalo' (1967) for orchestra
*''Libera me'' (1979) for ensemble (choir, piano, percussion, tape and lights)
*''Cerro Maior'' (dir. Luís Filipe Rocha, 1980) film music

==History==
The journal was established in 2002 by [[Claude Fischer]] and  is published by [[SAGE Publications]]; until 2011, it was published by the [[University of California Press]]. Fischer was succeeded by [[Jeff Goodwin]] and [[James M.

==Characteristics==
The journal differs from a typical academic journal as it is targeted more toward students and the general public. It is used widely in courses,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}, and a selection of its premier articles is available in book format through ''The Contexts Reader,'' published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], now in its second edition.

The new editors have introduced a blog feature on the magazines website, Contexts.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contexts.org Contexts.org website]&lt;/ref&gt;

New print issues are published quarterly in February (Winter), May (Spring), August (Summer) and November (Fall).

==Awards==
''Contexts'' won the Best Journal Award in the Social Sciences (2003) by Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of the [[Association of American Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/footnotes/feb03/indexone.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Articles and Interviews==
One of the most notable articles in ''Contexts'' is [[Ann Morning]]'s interview with [[Rachel Doležal]]. The interview has aired on many TV news networks, such as [[Fox News]], [[BBC]], and [[USA Today]], over the possibility of a trans-racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://contexts.org/blog/race-and-rachel-dolezal-an-interview/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic journal ranges in topics from [[social mobility]], [[immigration]], [[race (human categorization)|race]] (particularly its role in [[Get Out]]), [[Donald Trump]]'s potential border wall, and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://contexts.org Contexts.org website]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the board members for ''Contexts'', [[Tressie McMillan Cottom]], appeared on [[The Daily Show]] with [[Trevor Noah]] to discuss the impact of [[for-profit higher education in the United States]] on disadvantaged students.

'''Coursera''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ər|ˈ|s|ɛ|r|ə}}) is an online learning platform founded by Stanford professors [[Andrew Ng]] and [[Daphne Koller]] that offers courses, specializations, and degrees.

As of June 2018, Coursera had more than 33 million registered users&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterhigh/2018/06/18/from-founding-one-of-the-largest-fintechs-to-ceo-of-the-largest-edtech-coursera/#57e644ea7589|title=From Founding CEO Of One Of The Largest FinTechs To CEO Of The Largest EdTech - Coursera|publisher=“Forbes”|date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 2,400 courses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/coursera-2018-disruptor-50.html|title=Meet the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 companies - 42.

==Background==
=== History ===
Coursera was founded in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tamar Lewin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/education/consortium-of-colleges-takes-online-education-to-new-level.html?_r=0|title=Universities Reshaping Education on the Web|publisher=”NewYorkTimes”|date=17 July 2012|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Stanford University  [[computer science]] professors [[Andrew Ng]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/09/15/coursera-co-founder-andrew-ng-ai-shouldnt-be-regulated-as-a-basic-technology/#744b95e7d650|title=Coursera Co-Founder Andrew Ng: AI Shouldn't Be Regulated As A Basic Technology|last=Quora|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Daphne Koller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NPR Staff|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/30/162053927/online-education-grows-up-and-for-now-its-free|title=Online Education Grows Up, And For Now, It's Free Listen·18:14|publisher=”NPR”|date=30 September 2012|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ng and Koller were inspired by their experiences offering their Stanford courses online in fall 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2012/08/mco2012080008.html |title=Teaching the World: Daphne Koller and Coursera|publisher=”IEEE”|date= August 2012|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after left Stanford to launch Coursera. [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Stanford, the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] were the first universities to offer content on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waters, Audrey|url=http://hackeducation.com/2012/04/18/coursera|title=Coursera, the Other Stanford MOOC Startup, Officially Launches with More Poetry Classes, Fewer Robo-Graders|publisher=”Hacked Education”|date= 18 April 2012|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offerings have since expanded to include Specializations – collections of courses that build skills in a specific subject – as well as degrees and a workforce development product for businesses and government organizations.

===Funding===
The startup raised an initial $16 million funding round backed by [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] and [[New Enterprise Associates]]. In 2013, the [[World Bank Group]] led the [[Series B funding|Series B]] investment, which totaled $63 million.

The '''Doctor of Architecture''' (D Arch) degree program is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naab.org/school-view/?record_id=20569&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/study-architecture/accredited-programs&lt;/ref&gt; The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naab.org/info/mission/&lt;/ref&gt;, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/study-architecture&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional  graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.

Currently, the only University in the United States offering a Doctor of Architecture degree is the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]. The Doctorate of Architecture was first accredited by NAAB in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the University of Hawaii program is open to students who have completed high school, transfer students who have completed some college-level work, and students who have completed Baccalaureate or advanced degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the degree requires 120 undergraduate credits and 90 graduate credits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
In a retrospective review of Revell's work written by [[Stephen Burt]] for ''The Nation,'' he comments on ''Pennyweight Windows: New &amp; Selected Poems'': &lt;blockquote&gt;Revell now seeks a poetry appropriate not only to loneliness but to anger and happiness, not only to freighted symbols but to facts, not only to doubt but to faith. What's more, he seems to have found what he seeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20030512/burt ''The Nation'' &gt; ''The Revell Variations'' &gt; by Stephen Burt &gt; 04/24/03]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''TIME Magazine,'' [[Lev Grossman]] wrote about ''Pennywight Windows'': &lt;blockquote&gt;it takes guts to write more poems about peace, war, God and children, but Revell's are so fresh, it's as if he's the first person ever to do it. He makes you feel how painfully near grace and redemption are at all times, and yet how unattainable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1079621,00.html ''TIME'' &gt; ''7 Books Of Poetry Worth Curling Up With'' &gt; By LEV GROSSMAN &gt; Sunday, Jul. 10, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a theme here and in other reviews of Revell's recent books. Stephen Burts opens his review with a comment about how much Revell's work has changed in twenty years, noting the stylistic evolution, and the  increasingly spiritual focus of Revell's work, which Grossman observes in his, and which Revell corroborates in an interview by ''Poets &amp; Writers'': "What's next for me? I am concerned with the governance of heaven, which is mostly silence. Living in Utah and Nevada, I take my current instruction from snow and sand. They are heavenly forms-substantial and effortless. May poems be so."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pw.org/content/interview_poet_donald_revell ''Poets &amp; Writers'' &gt; ''An Interview With Poet Donald Revell'' &gt; By Nick Twemlow &gt; 04/05/02]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dropping out''' means leaving [[high school]], college, university or another group for practical reasons, necessities, or disillusionment with the system from which the individual in question leaves.

== Canada ==
In Canada, most individuals graduate grade 12 by the age of 18, according to Jason Gilmore who collects data of employment and education using the Labour Force Survey. The LFS is the official survey used to collect unemployment data in Canada (2010). Using this tool, assessing educational attainment and school attendance can calculate a dropout rate (Gilmore, 2010). It was found by the LFS that by 2009, 1 in 12 20-24-year-old adults did not have a high school diploma (Gilmore, 2010). It was also found by the study that men still have higher drop out rates than women, and that students outside of major cities and in the northern territories also have a higher risk of dropping out. Although since 1990, dropout rates have gone down from 20% to a low of 9% in 2010, it does not seem to be dropping since this time (2010).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The average Canadian dropout earns $70 less per week than their peers with a high school diploma. Graduates (without post-secondary) earned an average of $621 per week, whereas dropout students earned an average of $551 (Gilmore, 2010).

Even though dropout rates have gone down in the last 20–25 years,  the concerns of the impact dropping out has on the labor market is very real (Gilmore, 2010). One in four students without a high school diploma who were in the labor market in 2009-2010 had less likelihood of finding a job due to economic, downturn (Gilmore, 2010).

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, a dropout is anyone who leaves school, college or university without either completing their course of study or transferring to another educational institution. Dropping out of school is not allowed. Attendance at a school is mandatory until age 16 (GCSE exams) and students must be in some form of education or training (either full-time or part-time) until age 18.

Dropout rate benchmarks are set for each higher education institution and monitored by the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE), the [[Higher Education Funding Council for Wales]] (HEFCW) and the [[Scottish Funding Council]] (SFC).&lt;ref name="BBC News 19 Dec 2001"&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= University drop-out rates |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1719435.stm |accessdate=2 December 2014 |website= news.bbc.co.uk| date=19 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dropout rates are often one of the factors assessed when [[Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom|ranking UK universities]] in league tables.

In November 2014, a report from the  [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] found that students from poorer home backgrounds were 8.4 percentage points more likely to drop out of university in the first two years of an undergraduate course than those from the richest homes; they were also 22.9 percentage points less likely to obtain a [[2:1]] or [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first]] [[British undergraduate degree classification|degree]]. For students studying on the same course and who arrived at university with similar grades, the differences fell but remained significant. The report concluded that more should be done both to raise the attainment levels of poorer students prior to their arrival at university and to provide additional support to them at university.&lt;ref name="BBC News 4 Nov 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29895964|title= University 'drop-out risk for poorer students|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 November 2014 |website=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Main article|High school dropouts in the United States}}

In the United States, dropping out most commonly refers to a [[student]] quitting school before he or she graduates or avoiding entering a [[university]] or [[college]]. It cannot always be ascertained that a student has dropped out, as he or she may stop attending without terminating enrollment. It is estimated 1.2 million students annually drop out of high school in the United States, where high school graduation rates rank 19th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-dropping-out High School Dropouts - Do Something]. ''Do Something.'' Retrieved on 2013-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons are varied and may include: to find [[employment]], avoid [[bullying]], family emergency, poor grades, [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and other [[mental illnesses]], [[Teenage pregnancy|unexpected pregnancy]], bad environment, lack of freedom, and [[boredom]]. ''The Silent Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts''&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/TheSilentEpidemic3-06FINAL.pdf The Silent  Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts]. ''Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.'' Retrieved on 2013-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; by Civic Enterprises explores reasons students leave school without 
graduating. The consequences of dropping out of school can have long-term economic and social repercussions. Students who drop out of school in the United States are more likely to be 
unemployed, homeless, receiving welfare and incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodropouts.org NoDropouts.org]. ''NoDropouts.org.'' Retrieved on 2013-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; A four-year study in [[San Francisco]] found that 94 percent of young murder victims were high school dropouts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/Tough-solutions-for-high-school-truancy-rate-3178477.php Tough solutions for high school truancy rate - SFGate]. ''SFGate''. Retrieved on 2013-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Education]]'s measurement of the ''status'' dropout rate is the percentage of 16-24-year-olds who are not enrolled in school and have not earned a high school credential.&lt;ref name="nces"&gt;NCES 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This rate is different from the event dropout rate and related measures of the status completion and average freshman completion rates.&lt;ref name="nces1"&gt;NCES 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The status high school dropout rate in 2009 was 8.1%.&lt;ref name="nces" /&gt; There are many [[At-risk students|risk factors]] for high school dropout. These can be categorized into social and academic risk factors. Members of racial and ethnic minority groups drop out at higher rates than white students, as do those from low-income families, from single-parent households, and from families in which one or both parents also did not complete high school.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;Lee 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Students at risk for dropout based on academic risk factors are those who often have a history of absenteeism and grade retention, academic trouble, and more general disengagement from school life.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt;

== Australia ==
In Australia, dropping out most commonly refers to a student quitting school before he or she graduates. Reasons for students dropping out vary but usually include: Avoiding bullies, finding employment, family problems, depression and other mental illnesses, teenage pregnancy, substance abuse and in some cases even boredom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fall|first=Anna-Mária|last2=Roberts|first2=Greg|title=High school dropouts: Interactions between social context, self-perceptions, school engagement, and student dropout|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140197111001497|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=35|issue=4|pages=787–798|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.11.004|pmc=3478125|pmid=22153483|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at Melbourne's Mitchell Institute has found that a quarter of Australian high school students are not graduating year 12, and that completion rates are much worse in remote or economically disadvantaged communities. Professor Teese believes the segregation of students in schools through geography as well as in the private and public systems means student disadvantage is stronger in Australia than other western nations such as New Zealand and Canada.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-26/quarter-of-high-school-students-drop-out/6884578|title=One in four Australian students drop out of high school|date=2015-10-26|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drop out rates vary throughout different locations in Australia. Students that attend school in remote communities have a higher chance of not completing year 12 (56.6%), whereas students that come from a wealthy background share an average completion rate of 90%.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt; These remote schooling programs serve primarily indigenous students. Geography and lack of resources cause indigenous students to have lower rates of completion: the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous year 12 graduates is over 40 percentage points. As a result of this substantial difference, lower socioeconomic students who drop out are considered [[At-risk students|at-risk-students]] and are ultimately prone to unemployment, incarceration, low-paying employment and having children at early ages.

== Latin America ==
{{Main|School dropouts in Latin America}}

When analysing the household surveys of some countries in the [[Latin America]]n region – notably, those of [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Paraguay]] – researching the opinions of boys, girls, adolescents, young people as well as their families on the reasons they drop out of school, some recurring features surface that enable us to group the analyses into two main categories. The first is directly related to 'the material dimension' of education. In this case, [[financial difficulties]] are the main reason why families do not manage to keep their children and adolescents in school. The other major group of factors for school drop out falls into the 'subjective dimension' of the educational experience. Surveys revealed that 22% of out-of-school boys and girls aged 10 or 11 years state that they are in this situation because they have no interest in [[studying]]. This percentage jumps to 38% in adolescents aged 15 to 17 years who also provided this reason for their disengagement with the education system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf|title=Youth and changing realities: Rethinking secondary education in Latin America|last=López|first=Néstor|last2=Opertti|first2=Renato|last3=Vargas Tamez|first3=Carlos|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-31 00204-5|location=|pages=22–24, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dropout recovery==
A "dropout recovery" initiative is any community, government, non-profit or business program in which students who have previously left school are sought out for the purpose of re-enrollment. In the U.S., such initiatives are often focused on former high school students who are still young enough to have their educations publicly subsidized, generally those 22 years of age and younger. In Rwanda, dropout recovery is often focused on primary and ordinary level students who are still young to have their educations.
&lt;ref&gt;Rosann, Gregg. [http://www.nodropouts.org/blog/whiz-kids-and-wizards-why-it-s-time-change-way-we-think-about-who-can-go-high-school "Of whiz kids and wizards: Why it's time to change the way we think about who can go to high school"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120911051552/http://www.nodropouts.org/blog/whiz-kids-and-wizards-why-it-s-time-change-way-we-think-about-who-can-go-high-school |date=2012-09-11 }}, ''Nodropouts.org''. Retrieved on 2010-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Dropout recovery programs can be initiated in traditional "brick-and-mortar" institutions of learning, in community centers or online.

Dropping out of high school can have drastic long-term economic and social repercussions, especially in Australia which has a less equitable education system than many other western countries. Therefore, different pathways and courses of study are being implemented by the government, non for profit organizations and private companies to offer a selection of education recovery plans for young adults around the age of 22 and below.

== Attrition ==
Students that drop out of high-school are generally those that struggle to engage behaviorally and/or academically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=22153483|pmc=3478125|year=2012|author1=Fall|first1=A. M.|title=High school dropouts: Interactions between social context, self-perceptions, school engagement, and student dropout|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=35|issue=4|pages=787–98|last2=Roberts|first2=G|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, it is not entirely clear whether different types of contextual or self-system variables affect students' engagement or contribute to their decision to drop out. According to data collected by the national education longitudinal study of 1988, Rumberger found that students with moderate to high absenteeism, behavior problems and having no school or outside activities were highly predictive of dropping out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rumberger|first=Russell W.|last2=Larson|first2=Katherine A.|date=1998-11-01|title=Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/444201|journal=American Journal of Education|volume=107|issue=1|pages=1–35|doi=10.1086/444201|issn=0195-6744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==

=== Family dynamics ===
Under the pact of [[Inclusion (education)|educational inclusion]] at the secondary level, how families organize themselves internally to produce well-being is an unavoidable topic for countries to address when seeking to broaden the effective opportunities of access to, retention in and graduation from the secondary education. Therefore, the construction of a new policy, the adolescent and the young person at school, is an acknowledgement of what is happening in reality and shapes a mutually beneficial alliance between the state and families to generate dynamics where young people can become exclusive recipients of care – at least until completion of their secondary schooling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Edward Gardiner Howe''' was born in 1849 in [[Brookfield, Massachusetts]]. His family relocated to Chicago after several failed business ventures and eventually lost two properties, a farm and a family home, during the [[Great Chicago Fire]] in 1871. Howe returned to Massachusetts and studied at the [[Massachusetts Agricultural College]] in the early 1870s. He then became a science teacher and tutor for upper-class families such as the Burnhams and the Armors. He also authored two books about science education entitled ''Scientific Thinking''. Howe was so beloved by the families of his pupils that they funded a year’s sabbatical for his mental health in 1889. He spent this year doing geological research and resting in [[Portugal]]. He returned to teach in [[Chicago]] for several years before becoming principle of the University of Illinois Preparatory School in 1893. During his work as a private educator and as a principle, Howe invented the idea of field trips for science classes, a component of most modern primary and high school science courses today. He married fellow teacher Mary Elizabeth Barnard in 1881, and died in 1931.

'''The Fluxnet Canada Research Network''' is a [[research network]] of more than 100 [[scientist]]s, [[graduate student]]s and [[Postdoctoral research|postdoctoral fellows]] from 15 Canadian universities and nine federal and provincial government laboratories. One of the priorities of FCRN is determining the factors that govern the time required for a [[forest]] to become a net [[carbon sink]] following disturbances such as [[harvest]] or [[fire]]. Tower-mounted meteorological equipment is used to measure [[carbon flux]]es as well as water and energy exchange in 20 forested and seven [[peatland]] ecosystems in seven different provinces.

'''''Frames of Reference''''' is a 1960 black-and-white [[educational film]] directed by [[Richard Leacock]], written and presented by [[Patterson Hume]] and [[Donald Ivey]], and produced for the [[Physical Science Study Committee]].&lt;ref name="Turner1962"&gt;{{Cite article|last=Turner|first=Joseph|date=4 May 1962| url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/136/3514/357 |title= Art for Science's Sake |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume= 136 |number = 3514 |page= 359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film was made to be shown in high school physics courses and humor is employed both to hold students' interest and to demonstrate the concepts being discussed. In the film, [[University of Toronto]] [[physics]] professors [[Patterson Hume]] and [[Donald Ivey]] explain the distinction between [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[Non-inertial reference frame|noninertial]] [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]],&lt;ref name="Turner1962"/&gt; while demonstrating these concepts through humorous camera tricks. For example, the film opens with Dr. Hume, who appears to be upside down, accusing Dr. Ivey of being upside down. Only when the pair flip a coin and it floats up does it become obvious that Dr. Ivey&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;and the camera&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; are indeed inverted.&lt;ref name="Turner1962"/&gt;

'''''Gustaf'' Fredrik Åbergsson''' née '''Åberg''' (1775–1852) was a Swedish stage actor, theatre director and principal of [[Dramatens elevskola]]. He belonged to the leading actors in the Swedish theatre history, called ''The Hamlet of Stockholm''.

== Biography ==

Gustav Åbergsson was born to Jonas Åberg, footman at the royal court, and Fredrika Maria Svahn.  His father is thought to have been the son of [[Beata Sabina Straas]], the first professional native actress in Sweden to perform on a public stage in 1737, although this is unconfirmed.

===Stage career===

He was a student at the [[French Theatre of Gustav III]] in [[Bollhuset]], as his sister [[Inga Åberg]], in 1786.

According to popular legend, King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] originally placed him as a student in the Opera after having seen him in the park of [[Drottningholm Palace]]: after discovering that they shared the same name, the king asked him to sing a song. Gustav did so and blew kisses to the audience after, and the king had kissed him on his forehead.

He made his debut on the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in 1788, but as he was not considered more than a pretty face at the royal stage, he instead performed on the [[Stenborg Theatre]] until he was finally given a contract at the royal theatre in 1798.  He changed his name from Åberg to Åbergsson, because he wanted to avoid being connected to his scandal beauty-sister, [[Inga Åberg]].

Gustav Åbergsson was described as beautiful, with a fine figure, posture and grace and an easy manner, and was often given hero- and lover parts: "roles, which demands a beautiful body and pleasantness".&lt;ref&gt;Nordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska skådespelare från Gustav III till våra dagar. Förra delen, 1772-1842, Bonnier, Stockholm, 1917 ['Swedish theatre and Swedish actors from Gustav III to our days. First book 1772–1842']&lt;/ref&gt; He had an easy and refined way of acting and reportedly pleased the audience "By his attractive figure, his true way of acting and his refined manners."&lt;ref&gt;Nordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska skådespelare från Gustav III till våra dagar. Förra delen, 1772-1842, Bonnier, Stockholm, 1917 ['Swedish theatre and Swedish actors from Gustav III to our days. First book 1772–1842']&lt;/ref&gt;  He made many study trips to [[Paris]].   In 1812, he was made prefect of the dramatic stage.

In 1819, he and his spouse played the leading parts in [[Romeo and Juliet]], the first time this play was performed in Stockholm (though it had been performed in [[Norrköping]] in 1776).

In 1820–23, he was director of the [[Segerlind Theatre]] in [[Gothenburg]]. After this, he was instructor and, 1828–31, principal of Dramatens elevskola.

He retired in 1834.

===Private life===
He was married to the ballet dancer [[Margaretha Christina Hallongren]] (d. 1810) in 1793, and had a relationship with the star actress [[Carolina Kuhlman]] for several years before they married in 1815.

==Biography==
Lowe was born in [[Ilford, Essex]], in 1976. She taught English, and went on to teach Creative Writing at [[Oxford Brookes University]].&lt;ref name="ngp"/&gt; She began writing poetry at the age of 29 after her [[Chinese Jamaicans|Jamaican-Chinese]] father died and her English mother had a stroke, later reflecting: "I had been suppressing a lot of grief over a sustained period of time and poetry... opened a door on that pain. I found that I could revisit the past in my poems, and contain it, or alter it even." Following a suggestion by [[John Glenday]] at a course in 2010, she began to write about her father and this formed her debut collection ''Chick'' (Bloodaxe Books, 2013).&lt;ref name="faf" /&gt; This work was shortlisted for the [[Forward Prizes for Poetry|Forward]] and Fenton Adelburgh First Collection Prizes.

==Life==
A graduate of [[Boston University]] and the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], Clover is a Professor of [[English Literature]] and [[Critical Theory]] at the University of California, Davis, and was the distinguished Holloway poet-in-residence at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 2002-2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holloway.english.berkeley.edu/history/page19/page19.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613122845/http://holloway.english.berkeley.edu/history/page19/page19.html |archivedate=2007-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He writes a column on politics and popular culture, "Pop and Circumstance," for [[The Nation]]. He has written columns for [[Film Quarterly]], under the title "Marx and Coca-Cola," and is a former senior writer and editor at the ''[[Village Voice]].'' has contributed to ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', and the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', and is a former senior writer for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''.

Under the [[pseudonym]] "Jane Dark," Clover contributed to a number of film and music reviews for various outlets.

Clover is also a political activist. In January 2012, he and eleven students at the [[University of California, Davis]], engaged in a sit-in to protest the financial arrangements between U.S. Bank and the university. The protesters, who became known as the "Davis Dozen," were charged with "obstructing movement in a public place and conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/crime-fire-courts/da-charges-students-prof-in-bank-protests/&lt;/ref&gt; One month before the trial was scheduled to begin, the Davis Dozen accepted a plea deal from the Yolo County District Attorney. Under the terms of that agreement, the protesters received an infraction notice ticket and agreed to perform 80 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaggie.org/2013/05/09/davis-dozen-settlement-reaches-plea-deal-before-trial/&lt;/ref&gt;

Clover's given name at birth was Joshua Miller Kaplan but via legal change he took his mother's maiden name.  
His mother, [[Carol J. Clover]], is the originator of the [[final girl]] theory in a book on horror films and a professor emerita at the [[University of California at Berkeley]].

'''''Les Dingodossiers''''' is a humorous series of comics created by French artists [[Marcel Gotlib]] (cartoonist) and [[René Goscinny]] (writer) first published in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine from 1965 to 1967.

==Style==
[[Image:DingodossiersIntegrale.jpg|thumb|Art cover of the Integrale published by [[Dargaud]] in 2005]]
The term ''dingodossiers'' is a [[portmanteau]] of the two French words ''dingo'' or ''dingue'' ("mad") and ''dossiers''. As the title suggests, the series is composed of didactic dossiers with a very humorous tone. Each story consists of two to four strips drawn in black and white.
The strips deal with stereotypes and clichés and depict everyday life in a caricatured way. The stories are parodies and comic reports of scenes from marital and family life, work life, relations with neighbours, and holidays. A recurring character is Chaprot, a dunce pupil.

== Publication history ==
Marcel Gotlib and René Goscinny met in 1965 when Gotlib joined the ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine whose leader was Goscinny. Together they launched the ''Dingodossier'' series, with 169 stories published in ''Pilote'' between 1965 and 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://coffre-a-bd.com/journalpilote/series1/dingodossiers.htm{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 Goscinny, who had given up many series to become involved in the successful ''[[Asterix]]'' series, invited Gotlib to continue the series on his own. Gotlib decided to stop the series in 1968 and launched the series ''[[Rubrique-à-Brac]]'', very similar to the ''Dingodossiers'', but with a slightly different tone and some innovations. Gotlib declared that if the ''Dingodossiers'' series hadn't existed, maybe he would not have not created the RAB series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdparadisio.com/scripts/detailbd.cfm?Id=3886&lt;/ref&gt;

Three albums were published by Dargaud: ''Les Dingodossiers Tome 1'' in 1967 and ''Les Dingodossiers Tome 2'' in 1972, then ''Les Dingodossiers Tome 3'' in 1995 composed of previously unpublished strips. In 2005, a compendium was published by Dargaud.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bedetheque.com/serie-170-BD-Dingodossiers-(Les).html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5449">'''Margaret Cross''' (22 December 1866 in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], United Kingdom &amp;ndash; 14 March 1962 in [[Hemel Hempstead]], Hertfordshire, UK) was a British educator and school principal, a pioneer of [[Co-education]] and of [[Waldorf education|Steiner Waldorf education]] in Britain as well as of [[Biodynamic agriculture]] . Together with Hannah Clark she founded the Kings Langley Priory School, today the [[Rudolf Steiner School Kings Langley]]

==Biography==
Margaret Frances Cross was born on 22 December 1866 in Preston, Lancashire. Her mother died when she was two years old and she was raised by her maternal grandmother until she, in her turn, died. She then moved to her father’s family who were farming in Cambridgeshire, completed her schooling and studied at the [[University of Cambridge]]. While at the university, she met Miss Hannah Clark, one of the pioneers of co-educational boarding schools in Britain and began to work at her school as assistant teacher. The two became partners until Hannah Clark’s death in 1934, though at some point she left England to further her studies in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner in Britain by Crispian Villeneuve. Temple Lodge Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-906999-03-2}} P. 718&lt;/ref&gt;

With Hannah Clark, Margaret Cross moved first of all to [[Overstrand]] in Norfolk as teacher of music and mathematics, then in 1899 to Coombe Hill House, East Grinstead in Sussex, where apparently, her father, now retired from farming, lived as a border. Here the two women developed their educational methods and values of mixed-sex education close to nature, with the practical tasks farming and animal husbandry, cooking, cleaning and washing forming an integral part of the lessons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hertfordshire-genealogy.co.uk/data/places/places-k/kings-langley/kings-langley-priory-school.htm Coombe Hill School, Kings Langley published by Herfordshire Genealogy as reviewed on 2014.09.08]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 the Priory in Kings Langley, London was acquired, with Margaret Cross listed as co-principal and responsible for much of the development work. The intention was to integrate into the education the principles of [[Maria Montessori]], as particularly Margaret Cross was interested in modern methods of education and made it her business to attend conferences and keep abreast of developments. Then Margaret Cross was invited by Prof [[Millicent Mackenzie]] to join her with a group of other teachers from Britain, in attending a course of lectures on education by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in [[Dornach]], Switzerland in December 1921. This was followed in April 1922 by a further course of lectures Steiner held, this time in England, during which period he visited the school in Kings Langley. It was this visit that prompted the two women to offer their school as the first to implement the ideas of Steiner’s education in Britain, a conversion that was to take place over many years.

Margaret Cross began to concern herself with [[Anthroposophy]] and was present at the Christmas Foundation Meeting of the re-constituted [[Anthroposophical Society]] in 1923. It is not clear when she began to study and practice [[Biodynamic agriculture]] but in 1929 she joined the Agricultural Research circle of the Anthroposophical Society. Her initiative and research together with [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]] led to the founding of the Biodynamic Agricultural Foundation of Great Britain, today called the Biodynamic Agriculture Association. She was the editor of Stars and Furrows, the newsletter of the Biodynamic Foundation from 1935 until 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=848|title= Margaret Cross|publisher=Biographische Dokumentation der Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls|accessdate=2014-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her friend and lifelong co-worker, Hannah Clark, died in 1934, and tombstone is in the churchyard of the parish church of All Saints'. Miss Cross continued to run the school management together with a Miss Burton, who had joined them in 1915. Vera Compton-Burnett and her sister Juliet, sisters of the writer [[Ivy Compton-Burnett]] and daughters of the well-known homeopathic physician Dr James Compton-Burnett, were amongst the teachers at the school. The full conversion to Steiner education achieved its final step when the Rudolf Steiner New School moved into the Priory House site next door, gradually incorporating the old Priory and becoming the [[Rudolf Steiner School Kings Langley]]. Margaret Cross died in 1955 under the care of her friend and colleague Miss Burton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hertfordshire-genealogy.co.uk/data/places/places-k/kings-langley/kings-langley-priory-school.htm Coombe Hill School, Kings Langley published by Herfordshire Genealogy as reviewed on 2014.09.08]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located in the [[Teusaquillo]] locality, northwest of the historical center.  It is also the largest campus in Colombia, with an extension of {{convert|1200000|m2|acre|abbr=on}} and a constructed area of {{convert|308541|m2|acre|abbr=on}}, making it an ample campus with several green areas, open spaces, and pedestrian paths.  Among its buildings there are 17 which have been declared national monuments and, as a whole, it is a representation of the last 60 years of [[architecture]] in Colombia.

[[Image:PlazaCheoSantanderUNAL.JPG|thumb|right|Central square, Bogota's campus]]The campus was designed by German educationalist [[Fritz Karsen]] and architect [[Leopold Rother]], both refugees from Nazi Germany. The construction began in 1935, under the government of [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]]. It is organized as an ellipse, divided into five parts, each containing one of the academic divisions and its respective dependencies. From an aerial view, a shape of an owl can be seen, emblematic of a deep connection with wisdom and intuitive knowledge. The buildings were constructed as prismatic blocks, and painted white, in order to give an austere and clean look.

Some landmarks in the campus are the [[León de Greiff]] Auditorium, and the ''Francisco de Paula Santander'' Plaza, also known unofficially as the "Central Plaza" or the "Ché Plaza", in honor of [[Che Guevara|Ernesto ''el Ché'' Guevara]].  The campus has its own [[Alfonso López Pumarejo Stadium|stadium]], where sometimes matches for the [[Colombian Professional Football]] are held.

[[File:Open court reading.png|thumb|right]]

The '''Open Court Reading''' Program is a core Language arts/English series used in a large number of [[elementary school]]s classrooms.  It was one of two reading programs adopted for use in California  schools when textbooks were last chosen in 2002.  The other was [[Houghton-Mifflin]] Reading. For the 2008 Edition, Open Court Reading's name was changed to Imagine It!.

The series is published by [[McGraw-Hill Education]].

There is both praise and criticism of the program among educators.  Proponents of Open Court Reading believe that its focus on [[phonics]] and [[reading comprehension]] strategy use, both taught with very explicit instruction, benefit children.  Some critics dislike the explicit nature of instruction, suggesting that it leaves little room for child exploration or teacher creativity, as [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] models of reading instruction such as [[whole language]].  [[Success for All]], a whole-school reform model that includes reading has been studied extensively, but Open Court has been tested experimentally far less.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

[[File:Matura (oral part) - during exam 5.jpg|thumb|230px|An oral exam in the Czech Republic.]]

The '''oral exam''' (also '''oral test''' or '''''{{lang|la|viva voce}}'''''; '''''{{lang|de|Rigorosum}}''''' in [[German language|German-speaking]] nations) is a practice in many schools and disciplines in which an examiner poses questions to the student in spoken form. The student has to answer the question in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the subject to pass the exam. The oral exam also helps reduce (although it does not eliminate) the [[academic fraud|risk of granting a degree]] to a candidate who has had the thesis or dissertation [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by an expert.

==Overview==
Many science programs require students pursuing a [[bachelor's degree]] to finish the program by taking an oral exam or a combination of oral and written exams to show how well a student has understood the material studied in the program. Usually, study guides or a syllabus are made available so that the students may prepare for the exam by reviewing practice questions and topics likely to be on the exam.  There is a small but growing body of literature on the use of oral examinations in undergraduate education in the English speaking world. 

Some [[medical school]]s use oral exams for second and third year students to test knowledge but also the ability to respond on the spot. Students are required to take an oral exam prior to being awarded a [[PhD]]. Some universities allow the option of either taking written and oral exams or completing a [[project]] or [[thesis]], but occasionally, all three are required for graduation. Oral exams are distinct from a defense of a thesis in that the questions in the latter are more narrow and specific to the topic of the thesis.

[[Graduate student]]s are sometimes allowed to choose their examiners for oral exams.

Sometimes, the oral exam is offered in schools as an alternative to a written exam for students with a [[learning disability]], like [[dysgraphia]], [[developmental coordination disorder]], or [[non-verbal learning disorder]]. Often parents of the students have to request that the oral exam be given to their child in lieu of the written exam.

A [[Private pilot licence|Private Pilot Oral Exam]] is also required as part of the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] and [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|CAA]] practical test for prospective pilots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr483zBbQKw Private Pilot Oral Exam on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; An oral exam is also carried out by the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] in the [[UK]] for the purpose of issuing certificate of competencies for [[Merchant Navy]] deck and engine officers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-uk-seafarer-coc-deck-and-engineer-officers Application for UK COC Oral Exam]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''viva voce'' is a component of music diploma examinations administered by [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music|ABRSM]], [[Trinity College of Music]] and [[London College of Music]]. Candidates are posed a series of questions by the examiner about their chosen pieces, the composer and musical era. Depending on exam board, candidates may also be required to do a short writeup on their pieces.

'''Patricia A. Hannaford Career Center''', also known as '''Hannaford Career Center''', is a [[vocational]] educational pre-professional facility located at 51 Charles Avenue in bucolic [[Middlebury, Vermont]].  Programs include: Addison Repertory Theater (Technical and Performance Theater), Architecture &amp; Engineering Design, Automotive Technology, [[Culinary Arts]], Design &amp; Illustration, Diesel Power Technology, Forestry and Natural Resources, [[Human Services]], Industrial Design &amp; Fabrication, [[Medical Professions]], and Sustainable Agriculture.

The Career Center became independent of [[Addison Central Supervisory Union]] in the early 2000s.  It is an independent school district and supervisory union with Lynn Coale acting as both director and superintendent.

The school serves Union District #3 [[Middlebury Union High School]], Mt. Abraham Union High School, and [[Vergennes Union High School]].  However, programs such as the pre-professional theater training may be accessed by any Vermont student as long as the student can provide transportation to the site.

'''Peer 2 Peer University''' ('''P2PU''') is a [[nonprofit]] online [[open learning community]] which allows users to organize and participate in courses and study groups to learn about specific topics. Peer 2 Peer University was started in 2009 with funding from the [[Hewlett Foundation]] and the [[Shuttleworth Foundation]], with its first of courses in September of that year. An example of the "[[edupunk]]" approach to education, P2PU charges no tuition and courses are not [[accreditation|accredited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Katie Hafner | title = An Open Mind | quote = | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 16 April 2010 | pages = | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18open-t.html | accessdate = 15 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some courses in "The School of Webcraft" provide the opportunity for recognition of achievements through the [[Open Badges]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Watters | first = Audrey | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Master a new skill? Here's your badge | publisher = O'Reilly Radar | date = 8 September 2011 | url = http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/09/open-badges-project-learning-education.html | accessdate = 15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P2PU offers some of the features of [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs), but is focused on people sharing their knowledge on a topic or learning about a topic offered by another user with a [[DIY]] wiki-type mentality.&lt;ref name="nyt openmind"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hafner|first=Katie|title=An open mind|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18open-t.html?pagewanted=4&amp;_r=0|accessdate=30 October 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike typical massive open online courses, anyone can create a course as well as take one.&lt;ref name=dml-brazil&gt;{{cite web|last=Brazil|first=Jeff|title=P2PU: Learning for Everyone, by Everyone, about almost Anything|url=http://dmlcentral.net/blog/jeff-brazil/p2pu-learning-everyone-everyone-about-almost-anything|work=DMLCentral|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, because of its less hierarchical nature, P2PU activities need not necessarily be ''Courses''; the admin of the learning environment can select from ''Study Group'' and ''Challenge'' as well as creating their own term.

==Academic profile==

P2PU's [[peer to peer]] philosophy is meant to put a "social and pedagogical wrapper" around [[Open Access|open access]] and [[Open educational resources|educational materials]]. There is some evidence to suggest that greater social participation in P2PU may lead to more invested learning than other online education.&lt;ref name=Panagiota&gt;{{cite web|last=Panagiota|first=Alevizou|title=Distributed mentoring: peer interaction and collaborative learning in P2PU|url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/24628/1/Alevizou_OpenEd_conferencev2.pdf|work=Open ED 2010: Seventh Annual Open Education Conference, 2–4 November 2010, Barcelona, Spain|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in an early P2PU course on [[cyberpunk]] literature, research noted "a shift from the subject-authority pattern of relations generally associated with teacher-led education to the agential pattern of relations associated with peer-led education."&lt;ref name=social-technical&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ponti|first=Marisa|title=Socio-Technical Relations in the Creation of an Interest-Driven Open Course|journal=Symposium Journals|date=January 2011|volume=8|issue=4|pages=408–422}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Class participants communicate live through technologies such as [[Skype]] and [[IRC]] as well as asynchronously through the P2PU website, allowing geographically dispersed classmates to have discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sreevatsan|first=Ajai|title=P2PU organises learning outside institutional walls|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/article509669.ece|accessdate=16 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
P2PU is organized into ''Schools'' which include:
*'''Social Innovation''' - Focused on social innovation.
*'''School of Webcraft''' - Backed by [[Mozilla]]
*'''School of Open''' - Coordinated with [[Creative Commons]]
*'''School of Education''' - Focused on [[pedagogy]]
*'''Mathematical Future''' - coordinated with ''Natural Math family learning network'' and ''Math 2.0 interest group''.

P2PU's school of Webcraft courses were early adopters of a [[Mozilla Open Badges|badge]] reward system,&lt;ref name="standford biz"&gt;{{cite news|last=Esienberg |first=Anne |title=Now, digital badges for job hunters |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/technology/news/now-digital-badges-for-job-hunters/456232/ |accessdate=30 October 2012 |newspaper=Standford Business |date=Nov 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123074217/http://www.business-standard.com/india/technology/news/now-digital-badges-for-job-hunters/456232/ |archivedate=November 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with their task completion system there are elements of [[gamification]] and [[gamification of learning]].

Some of the courses that have been or are currently being offered include:

* '''Mental wealth: know it and grow it''' - A global exploration of the perceptions and stigma attached to mental health
* '''Open Science: An Introduction''' - Where you can learn about the open access movement related to such things as medical research data to help cure diseases.
* '''Compassionate Nerds''' - A course that seeks to explain why despite billions of dollars to tackle social problems they remain and what can be done about it.

==Infrastructure==

The main [[learning management system]] for P2PU courses is called Lernanta (the [[Esperanto]] word for "learning"). It is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] using the [[Django web framework]], and is developed and maintained by P2PU's community and staff.  One P2PU study group, "Introduction to Contributing to Lernanta", is designed to help people become Lernanta contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributing to Lernanta|url=https://p2pu.org/en/groups/introduction-to-contributing-to-lernata/|work=P2PU|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fork of the Mozilla Foundation's Batacuda software that powers drumbeat.org, Lernanta is available under the [[Mozilla Public License]], the [[GNU GPL]], and the [[LGPL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LICENSE.txt|url=https://github.com/p2pu/lernanta/blob/master/LICENSE.txt|work=Lernata|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; P2PU also hosts a [[wiki]] and an [[OSQA]] server for questions and answers.

== Projects ==
P2PU is hosting and coordinating the MOOC joint-venture ''Mechanical MOOC'' which is a blend of open online resources. The first Mechanical MOOC class will be “A Gentle Introduction to Python,” which is part [[M.I.T.]] [[OpenCourseWare]], instant-feedback exercises and quizzes from [[Codecademy]], and study groups organized by [[OpenStudy]], while P2PU handles central communication such as email and discussion.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|title=Free Online Course Will Rely on Multiple Sites|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/education/mechanical-mooc-to-rely-on-free-learning-sites.html?_r=0|work=New York Times|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical MOOC is less tightly structured than traditional MOOC offerings that are backed by Universities, and offers no accreditation. Yet the initiators claim that this comes with an advantage they will capitalize on: if a student falls behind, they may repeat units at their own pace to catch up.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

== History ==
The founding members of P2PU are Delia Browne, Neeru Paharia, Stian Haklev, Joel Thierstein and Philipp Schmidt. The organization is a 501(c)(3) [[nonprofit]] with funding from The [[Hewlett Foundation]], The [[Shuttleworth Foundation]], and [[University of California Irvine]].&lt;ref name=aboutpage&gt;{{cite web|title=Org|url=http://info.p2pu.org/about/org/|work=About Page|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt explained in a video interview that P2PU came to be when he and his friends, later to become his co-founders, attempted to put the championed [[open educational resources]] to the test, and try to learn from them. They selected a topic they were unfamiliar with, Psychology, and set up weekly calls, to try to learn as a group with the materials. Schmidt says it was "incredibly hard," and "what's more important is the social aspect, that bond that forms between people, and the content is really just the beginning of the learning experience."&lt;ref name=vimeo&gt;{{cite video |people=DML Research Hub |year=2011 |title=P2PU: Learning for everyone, by everyone, about almost anything |url=http://vimeo.com/24114828 |format=http |medium=Flash |trans_title= |publisher=Vimeo |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2012-11-14 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for P2PU were announced in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=YOUNG|first=JEFFREY R.|title=Proponents of Online Education Plan to Start Peer-to-Peer University|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Proponents-of-Online-Education/31394|accessdate=16 January 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first set of courses was originally planned to begin in January 2009, but the official launch was delayed until September 2009.  The project was initially supported by a $70,000 grant from the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=YOUNG|first=JEFFREY R.|title=P2P U., an Experiment in Free Online Education, Opens for Business|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/p2p-u-an-experiment-in-free-online-education-opens-for-business/7739|accessdate=16 January 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, P2PU ran seven pilot courses with a total of 227 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Update on P2PU – We are on our way|url=http://info.p2pu.org/about/org/|work=P2PU Blog|accessdate=16 January 2013|date=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of September 2011, P2PU claims "a community of about 1,000" and has over 50 courses open for sign-up.&lt;ref name="aboutpage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://p2pu.org/en/groups/ Accessed 15 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5165">The '''Pontifical Committee of Historical Sciences''' is a division of the [[Roman Curia]] established on 7 April 1954 by [[Pope Pius XII]]. 

==Background==
Pope Pius XII created this Committee on 7 April 1954 as the successor to the Commission of Cardinals for Historical Studies, which Pope Leo XIII had created on 18 August 1883 with the [[apostolic letter]] ''Saepenumero considerantes''. That commission was created to contribute to the development and proper use of historical sciences, especially late in the nineteenth century when parts of the Vatican's historical records, known as the [[Vatican Secret Archive]], was opened to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=it | website= Pontficio Comitato di Scienze Storiche | title= Profilo storico del Comitato| accessdate=7 April 2018 | url=http://www.historia.va/content/scienzestoriche/it/struttura-del-comitato/profilo-storico.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Committee was created to foster cooperation with the [[International Committee of Historical Sciences]], which was scheduled to hold its convention in Rome in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Otto | editor-first1=Bernd-Christian  | editor-first2= Susanne |editor-last2=Rau |editor-first3= Jörg |editor-last3= Rüpke| title=History and Religion: Narrating a Religious Past|date=2015|publisher=Walter de Gruyter| location=Berlin/Boston| page=452|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YM55CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA452&amp;|accessdate=7 April 2018 | first=Giovanni | last= Filoramo | chapter= Locating the history of Christianity between the history of the church and the History of Religions: The Italian case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The Committee is charged with promoting the use of ecclesiastical archives for historical research and fostering cooperation with ecclesiastical and extra-ecclesial institutions and associations, particularly at the international level. It sponsors seminars and conferences, both independently and in concert with peer organizations; reviews the historical data presented in the ''[[Pontifical Yearbook]]''; collaborates with multinational scientific initiatives ([[UNESCO]]); and sponsors internships for the study of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].

In 2011, the Committee held a conference devoted to St. [[Catherine of Siena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency= Catholic News Agency | url = https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/italian-conference-set-to-honor-st.-catherine-of-siena | accessdate = 8 April 2018 | date= 21 October 2011| title = Italian conference set to honor St. Catherine of Siena | first= David |last=Kerr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it marked the 1700th anniversary of the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge|Battle of Ponte Milvio]] with a conference called "Constantine the Great.

'''José Rafael Moneo Vallés''' (born 9 May 1937) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[architect]]. He won the [[Pritzker Prize]] for architecture in 1996 and the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] in 2003. 

==Life and career==
Born in [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], [[Spain]], Moneo studied at the [[ETSAM]], [[Technical University of Madrid]] (UPM) from which he received his architectural degree in 1961. From the [[Davis Museum and Cultural Center|Davis Art Museum]] at [[Wellesley College]] in [[Massachusetts]] and the [[Audrey Jones Beck]] [[Audrey Jones Beck Building|Building]] (an expansion of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]]). Moneo also designed the [[Chace Center]], a new building for the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risd.edu/campus_initiatives_risd.htm ''Campus Initiatives: The Chace Center''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525140112/http://www.risd.edu/campus_initiatives_risd.htm |date=2006-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, the Northwest Corner Building (formerly the Interdepartmental Science Building) at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] first opened. Moneo's most recent work is [[Peretsman-Scully Hall]] and the [[Princeton Neuroscience Institute]], which houses the psychology and neuroscience departments at [[Princeton University]] and opened in December 2013.

In 2012, he was awarded with 2012 [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for the Arts. According to the jury, Moneo is ''a Spanish architect of universal scope whose work enriches urban spaces with an architecture that is serene and meticulous. An acknowledged master in both the academic and professional field, Moneo leaves his own mark on each of his creations, at the same time as combining aesthetics with functionality, especially in the airy interiors that act as impeccable settings for great works of culture and the spirit.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpa.es/en/awards/2012/rafael-moneo-1/jury/ ''Minutes of the Jury for the 2012 Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts.

{{Unfocused |talk=Unfocused |reason=the lead talks about retraction more generally, but the entire body seems limited to scientific publishing retractions|date=September 2018}}
}}

A '''retraction''' is a public statement made about an earlier statement that withdraws, cancels, refutes, or reverses the original statement or ceases and desists from publishing the original statement. {{cn|date=September 2018}}

== Retraction in science ==

The retraction may be initiated by the editors of a journal, or by the author(s) of the papers (or their institution). {{cn|date=September 2018}} Retractions are in some cases accompanied by apologies for the previous error and/or expressions of gratitude to persons who disclosed the error to the author.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

A retraction of a published [[science|scientific]] article indicates that the original article should not have been published and that its data and conclusions should not be used as part of the foundation for future [[research]]. The most common reasons for the retraction of articles are [[scientific misconduct]] {{ref}} including plagiarism, serious errors, and duplicate/concurrent publishing (self-plagiarism). The retraction may be initiated by the editors of the journal, or by the author(s) of the papers (or their institution). A lesser withdrawal of content than a full retraction may be labelled a correction. There have been numerous examples of retracted scientific publications. [[Retraction Watch]] provides updates on new retractions, and discusses general issues in relation to retractions.&lt;ref name=COPEguidelines&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)62074-2 |pmid=19962558 |title=COPE's retraction guidelines |journal=The Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9705 |pages=1876–7 |year=2009 |last1=Kleinert |first1=Sabine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/are-retraction-wars-a-sign-that-science-is-broken/ The retraction war - Scientists seek demigod status, journals want blockbuster results, and retractions are on the rise] (December 2014), Jill Neimark, ''[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 paper in the ''Journal of Medical Ethics'' attempted to quantify retraction rates in [[PubMed]] over time to determine if the rate was increasing, even while taking into account the increased number of overall publications occurring each year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Steen, R. G. (2011). Retractions in the scientific literature: Is the incidence of research fraud increasing? ''Journal of Medical Ethics, 37''(4), 249-253. doi: 10.1136/jme.2010.040923.&lt;/ref&gt; The author found that the rate of increase in retractions was greater than the rate of increase in publications. Moreover, the author notes the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is particularly striking that the number of papers retracted for fraud increased more than sevenfold in the 6 years between 2004 and 2009. During the same period, the number of papers retracted for a scientific mistake did not even double..." (p. 251).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Although the author suggests that his findings may indeed indicate a recent increase in scientific fraud, he also acknowledges other possibilities. For example, increased rates of fraud in recent years may simply indicate that journals are doing a better job of policing the scientific literature than they have in the past. Furthermore, because retractions occur for a very small percentage of overall publications ( fewer than 1 in 1,000 articles &lt;ref name=medit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/two-cheers-for-the-retraction-boom "Two Cheers for the Retraction Boom"] (retrieven October 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;), a few scientists who are willing to commit large amounts of fraud can highly impact retraction rates. For example, the author points out that [[Jan-Hendrik Schön|Jan Hendrik Schön]] fabricated results in 15 retracted papers in the dataset he reviewed, all of which were retracted in 2002 and 2003, "so he alone was responsible for 56% of papers retracted for fraud in 2002—2003” (p 252).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Retraction Watch]] is a blog that reports on retractions of scientific papers and on related topics.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[CBC News]] | first = Stephen | last = Strauss | title = Searching for truth in published research | URL = http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/04/04/f-vp-strauss-truth-published-research.html | date = April 7, 2011 | accessdate = October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable retractions ==

===In science===
==== Retraction for error ====
* '''2013''' - Study on the [[Mediterranean diet]] published in ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' and widely covered by media was retracted due to unreported non-random assignments.  This was part of a larger effort verifying proper randomization in thousands of studies by anesthesiologist [[John Carlisle (researcher)|John Carlisle]], who found problems in about 2% of those analyzed.&lt;ref name=medit&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/06/13/619619302/errors-trigger-retraction-of-study-on-mediterranean-diets-heart-benefits Errors Trigger Retraction Of Study On Mediterranean Diet's Heart Benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2012''' - [[Séralini affair]] - Article suggesting reported an increase in [[tumors]] among rats fed [[genetically modified corn]] and the herbicide [[RoundUp]] retracted due to criticism of experimental design. According to the editor of the journal, a "more in-depth look at the raw data revealed that no definitive conclusions can be reached with this small sample size".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.005 |pmid=22999595 |title=RETRACTED: Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize |journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |volume=50 |issue=11 |pages=4221–31 |year=2012 |last1=Séralini |first1=Gilles-Eric |last2=Clair |first2=Emilie |last3=Mesnage |first3=Robin |last4=Gress |first4=Steeve |last5=Defarge |first5=Nicolas |last6=Malatesta |first6=Manuela |last7=Hennequin |first7=Didier |last8=De Vendômois |first8=Joël Spiroux }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Frank Cameron Jackson]], supporter of the theory of [[epiphenomenalism]], retracted his position due to an error in reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/publications/proceedings/v76n3/public/abstracts.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516091824/http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/publications/proceedings/v76n3/public/abstracts.asp|archivedate=2008-05-16|deadurl=yes|title=Jacksoon's Retraction|author=Torin Alter |publisher=APA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Retraction for fraud or misconduct ====
* '''2014''' An article by [[Haruko Obokata]] et al. on [[STAP cell]]s, a method of inducing a cell to become a stem cell, was proven to be falsified. Originally published in ''[[Nature]]'', it was retracted later that year. It generated much controversy, and after an institutional investigation, one of the authors committed suicide.&lt;ref name=retract&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan researcher agrees to withdraw disputed stem cell paper|author=Elaine Lies|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/04/us-japan-stemcells-researcher-idUSKBN0EF0SO20140604|newspaper=Reuters|date=4 June 2014|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Suicide&gt;{{cite news|title=STAP paper co-author Sasai commits suicide|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/05/national/embattled-stap-study-co-author-dies-after-apparent-suicide-bid/|accessdate=5 August 2014|work=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2011''' Retraction: Enhanced Inhibition of Tumour Growth and Metastasis, and Induction of Antitumour Immunity by IL-2-IgG2b Fusion Protein.

*'''2011''' [[Anil Potti]], formerly a cancer researcher at [[Duke University]].  Eight journal articles authored by [[Anil Potti]] and others that describe genomic signatures of cancer prognosis and predictors of response to cancer treatment were retracted in 2011 and 2012. The retraction notices generally state that the results of the analyses described in the articles could not be reproduced. In November 2015, the [[Office of Research Integrity]] (ORI) found that Potti had engaged in research misconduct&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21528593 |work=The Economist|date=10 September 2011|title=Misconduct in science : An array of errors }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2010'''  A 1998 paper by [[Andrew Wakefield]] proposing that the MMR vaccine might cause autism, which was responsible for the [[MMR vaccine controversy]], was retracted because "the claims in the original paper that children were “consecutively referred” and that investigations were “approved” by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60175-4 |pmid=20137807 |laysource=BBC News |laydate=2010-02-02 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/health/8493753.stm |title=Retraction—Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=The Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9713 |pages=445 |year=2010 |last1=The Editors Of The Lancet }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2009''' Numerous papers written by [[Scott Reuben]] from 1996 to 2009 were retracted after it was discovered he never actually conducted any of the trials he claimed to have run.
*'''2007''' Retraction of several articles written by social psychologist [[Jennifer Lerner]] and colleagues  from journals including ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin (journal)|Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Biological Psychiatry (journal)|Biological Psychiatry]]''.
*'''2006''' Retraction of ''Patient-specific embryonic stem cells derived from human SCNT blastocysts.'' written by [[Hwang Woo-Suk]]. Fabrications in the field of stem cell research led to 'indictment on embezzlement and bioethics law violations linked to faked stem cell research'.
*'''2003''' Numerous articles with questionable data from physicist [[Jan Hendrik Schön]] from many journals including both ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' are retracted.
*'''2002''' Retraction of announced discovery of elements 116 and 118. See [[Livermorium]], [[Victor Ninov]].
*'''2002''' [[Retracted article on dopaminergic neurotoxicity of MDMA]]
*'''1991''' Thereza Imanishi-Kari, who worked with [[David Baltimore]], published a 1986 article in the journal ''Cell''. Margot O'Toole, a postdoctoral researcher for Imanishi-Kari publicized Imanishi-Kari's scientific misconduct. After a major investigation, Baltimore was finally forced to issue a retraction in 1991 when the [[National Institutes of Health]] concluded that data in the 1986 Imanishi-Kari article had been falsified.  In 1996, an expert panel appointed by the federal government cleared Imanishi-Kari of misconduct, finding no evidence of scientific fraud.
*'''1982''' [[John Darsee]].  Fabricated results in the Cardiac Research Laboratory of [[Eugene Braunwald]] at Harvard in the early 1980s. Initially thought to be brilliant by his boss.  He was caught out by fellow researchers in the same laboratory.

The '''Royal Commission on Scientific Instruction and the Advancement of Science''' or the '''Devonshire Report''' was a [[Royal Commission]] of the [[United Kingdom]] that sat from 1870 to 1875.

The Commission was appointed in May 1870, chaired by the [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] and included [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], Sir [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], Sir [[Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, 1st Baronet|James Kay-Shuttleworth]], [[Sir Bernhard Samuelson, 1st Baronet|Bernhard Samuelson]], [[William Sharpey]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] (Professor of Natural History at the Royal School of Mines), [[William Allen Miller]] (Professor of Chemistry at King's College, London), and [[George Gabriel Stokes]] (Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (21 May 1870), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Lockyer]] served as Secretary to the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11618">The '''Special Class for the Gifted Young''' is a program aimed to select gifted young students to enter the universities in [[China]]. First established in 1978 at the [[University of Science and Technology of China]], it was a major innovation in China's higher education. The idea was suggested by renowned scientists such as [[Tsung-Dao Lee]], [[C. N. Yang]], and [[Samuel C. C. Ting]], and supported by the then Vice-premier of the State Council [[Fang Yi]]. The objective of the class is to explore the most efficient ways to nurture promising youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/about/201107/t20110707_115587.html |title= School of the Gifted Young, USTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peking University]], [[Tsinghua University]], [[Nanjing University]], [[Wuhan University]], [[Jilin University]] and [[Huazhong University of Science and Technology]] also launched similar programs. But they were all shut down for all kinds of reasons. For now, only the [[University of Science and Technology of China]] and [[Xi'an Jiaotong University]] still have this program.

== In the University of Science and Technology of China ==

By October 2006, the Special Class for the Gifted Young of the University of Science and Technology of China has enrolled a total of 1134 exceptionally gifted youth, 942 of whom have already graduated.

With the success of the class, a new class was established and adjoined to the original class in 1985, namely "'''The Experimental Class of Teaching Reform'''", more popularly known as the '''Double Zero Class''', which is conducted under the same guiding spirit as the Special Class for the Gifted Young. This class has now become an integral part of the program. In 2008, the Special Class for the Gifted Young combined with the Experimental Class of Teaching Reform and the '''Experimental Class of Innovation''' became the '''School of the Gifted Young'''. The three classes now select students in different ways, while the admitted students receive the same training from the school.

The Special Class for the Gifted Young upholds the guiding principle of "''selecting talents despite their age and cater to their individual potentials''." The curriculum aims to strengthen the foundation courses and an all-round education in the first two years, and in the later years allow students to enjoy wide latitude in developing their potentials and interest. Students are encouraged to attend seminar courses, sign up for the various "''student research projects''," and participate in their professors' research projects. This kind of real research environment not only provides valuable opportunities for them to apply what they have learned in the classroom and give their initiative and creativity full play, but also enhances the spirit of teamwork and cultivates personal integrity.

The past two decades has proven the success of the program. Its students have won numerous prizes in such international and national contests. 80 percent of its graduates have been enrolled in postgraduate programs at home or abroad, one third of whom have already obtained doctoral degrees.  Its graduates have now spread all over the world. Among them are the 31-year-old and 34-year-old full professors at Harvard University, the 40-year-old US National Academy of Sciences member, the 31-year-old IEEE fellow and the president of [[Baidu]], the discoverer of the smallest possible [[carbon nanotube]], winners of the U.S. [[Presidential Early Career Award]] for Scientists and Engineers, [[TR35]] innovators selected by [[MIT Technology Review]] and so on.

=== Special Class for the Gifted Young ===

The Special Class for the Gifted Young is the traditional and original program of its kind with strict age limit. For instance, to enroll in 2016, a student must have a birth date after January 1, 2000. Prospective students must first pass the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination|National College Entrance Examination in China]], and then the final test arranged by USTC, which mainly focuses on the student's ability in mathematics and physics. Approximately 40 to 50 students are admitted every year to the class.

=== Experimental Class of Innovation ===

The Experimental Class of Innovation was established in 2008, with relatively weak age limit. For instance, to enroll in 2016, a student must have a birthdate after January 1, 1999.

=== Experimental Class of Teaching Reform ===

More popularly known as the '''Double Zero Class''' (Chinese: '''零零班'''), the Experimental Class of Teaching Reform selects students with regular process, so there is no age limit. It admits the best among the students already admitted by the university. Students in USTC have another chance to be admitted to this class, if they perform extremely well in the university's examination for all newly admitted students.

== In Xi'an Jiaotong University ==

In 1985, Xi'an Jiaotong University established a special class for gifted youth called '''Honors Youth Program of Xi'an Jiaotong University''' (Chinese: '''西安交大少年班''', also translated as '''Special Class for the Gifted Young of Xi'an Jiaotong University''', a name usually confused with the equivalent in the [[University of Science and Technology of China|USTC]]). The class aims to select talents and explore ways to nurture promising youth without the widely criticized&lt;ref name="Stressful Times"&gt;{{cite news | last=  Siegel | first= Ben | url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1631854,00.html | title= Stressful Times for Chinese Students

==In Jilin University==
The Jilin University Gifted Young (吉大少年班) program began in 1985 and continued into late 90's, enrolling 10 to 20 each year. In the first few years, the students shared dorm rooms and were given special care for their well being in contrast with the adult students who weren't. The students had a few majors to choose from on their entry. In 1985 and 1987, some chose Physics, some chose Mathematics and the rest chose Computer Science. In 1988, all 21 students were in Computer Software. There were no enrollments in 1986. From 1989 to the end of the program, instead of living together, the newly enrolled students settled down with their adult classmates and barely received the special care as their seniors did.

'''St. Xavier's College, Maitighar,''' in [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]], is an educational institution in  [[Nepal]] run by the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits) since 1988. It offers intermediate level high school courses (grades 11 and 12) through the [[GCE Advanced Level|Cambridge A-levels]] and [[10+2]] programmes, as well as Bachelor's and Master's degrees in natural science, business, social science, and humanities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edusanjal.com/college/st-xaviers-college/|title=St. Xaviers College Maitighar Kathmandu|website=Edusanjal|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jesuits began their educational work in Nepal in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.educatenepal.com/institutions/detail/st-xaviers-college-maitighar-kathmandu|title=St. Xavier's College :: Educatenepal.com|website=www.educatenepal.com|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Xavier's College functioned as an evening Intermediate Science from the premises of [[St. Xavier's School, Jawalakhel]], Lalitpur in the initial years, and later moved to its own building at [[Maitighar]], [[Kathmandu]], in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sxc.edu.np/index.php/hn/ocollege|title=Our College|year=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702113013/http://www.sxc.edu.np/index.php/hn/ocollege|archivedate=2016-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first eight years, the only course offered was Intermediate in Science, in affiliation with [[Tribhuwan University|Tribhuvan University]]. In 1996 the three-year Bachelor of Science in Social Work, the first of its kind in Nepal, was established in conjunction with [[Kathmandu University]]. In 1997 a B.Sc. in Environmental Science was offered but after three years discontinued admitting students. Since then bachelor's degrees have been added in Business Studies and Physics in 2002, in Information Management in 2003, and in 2007 in Computer Science and Information Technology, Microbiology, and B.A. in English, Journalism and Social Work. In 2007 also five master's degree programs were established, in Physics, Microbiology, Business, Social Work, and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title =Xavier, Maitighar, Department| url =http://www.sxc.edu.np/#}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Higher Secondary School Level (+2) was initiated and in 2011 [[GCE Advanced Level|Cambridge A-levels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Xavier, Maitighar, A-levels| url =http://www.sxc.edu.np/index.php/2014-11-20-02-04-17/2014-11-20-06-36-32/a-level| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160106224927/http://www.sxc.edu.np/index.php/2014-11-20-02-04-17/2014-11-20-06-36-32/a-level| archivedate =2016-01-06| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College moved to Maitighar Heights in 1988 and the first new building, the Academic Block, was built in 1993. The construction of the Administration Block was completed in 1998, followed by that of Watrin Hall and the Library Block in 2000. To cater to the needs of the two IT-based degree programs, and to provide all students with computer facilities, four computer laboratories were constructed, with a total of 203 internet-connected computers. The E.L. Watrin Memorial Building was built in 2005, linking the Academic Block with the Administration Block. A rooftop cafeteria was built in 2006. In 2009 a six-storey building housing modern laboratories for physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and microbiology and social studies. There is also a sports hall that doubles as an auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vastukalanepal.com/projects.php?pid=6&amp;id=2|title=PROJECTS : Vastukala Paramarsha|website=vastukalanepal.com|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College celebrated its silver jubilee in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ignation.ca/2013/09/06/a-reason-to-celebrate-the-silver-jubilee-of-st-xaviers-college/|title=igNation on silver jubilee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission==
Today, the College has approximately 3,000 students coming from 275 schools representing all 75 districts and almost all the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of Nepal. One of the innovative outreach programs is the Partnership in Education (PIE) established in 2004. PIE works in partnership with government schools for the development of the academically weak students in the lowest income brackets, accommodating approximately 300 students annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A typical admission profile of St. Xavier's can be correlated to their admission criteria for intermediate programmes (grades 11 and 12) which is extremely competitive. Every year more than 13,000 students from throughout Nepal apply and around 500 students are enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/multimedia/photo-gallery/entrance-exam-st-xaviers-college/|title=Quest for education - The Himalayan Times|date=2016-07-02|work=The Himalayan Times|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 of the 685 selected 520 enrolled, with a median GPA of 3.9/4.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sxc.edu.np/docs/sxc_class_profile_for_high_school_students.pdf|title=Students admitted (2011-13)|year=2012}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The admission process includes a preliminary cutoff score at the [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|School Leaving Certificate]] national exam – equivalent of [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]], an analytic [[Multiple Choice]] examination, and an interview with college personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Xavier, Admissions| url =http://www.sxc.edu.np/images/Docs/prospectus_+2.pdf| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160709204536/http://sxc.edu.np/images/Docs/prospectus_+2.pdf| archivedate =2016-07-09| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate Level Courses ===

====Plus Two (+2)====
For the first eight years, the college had offered an Intermediate in Science course. Bachelor's and master's level courses affiliated with [[Tribhuvan University]] and [[Kathmandu University]] have been running other courses as well. In the year 2009, Intermediate in Science was terminated and Higher Secondary Level (+2) science stream was initiated in affiliation with the [[Higher Secondary Education Board]], Nepal. This level of education is the main reason for this college to acclaim its reputation in the country. The college has completed its sixth year of the +2 program with facilities including a well-equipped laboratory, library, cafeteria, and basketball court. The Higher Secondary Level (+2) science program has offered only two sub-streams: Biology and Physics with 10 different sections(A to J).Section A to Section F are biology sections and remaining are physics sections. All the students of +2 science study a similar combination of five subjects (physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and English) in grade XI and in grade XII biology students study physics, chemistry, biology, English, and Nepali, whereas physics students study physics, chemistry, mathematics, English, and Nepali.&lt;ref name=depart&gt;{{cite web

==Biography==

=== Early work and education ===
Bissette was born and raised in Vermont, where he still lives, and was raised [[Catholicism|Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/article/steve-bissette-30751|title= Steve Bissette|first= Chris|last= Dahlen|date= July 23, 2009|publisher= ''[[The A.V.

I don’t get this.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the publication of his first work, ''Abyss'' (1976),&lt;ref name="GCD"&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search=Bissette|title=Stephen R. Bissette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bissette enrolled in the first class of [[The Kubert School]].&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web|first= Chris|last= Dahlen|url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/steve-bissette,30751/ |title= Steve Bissette|work= The A.V.

Rock]]'', and ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]''.&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt; In 1978, Bissette was among the Kubert School's first graduating class, along with classmates [[Rick Veitch]], [[Tom Yeates]], and others.

While still enrolled at The Kubert School, Bissette executed the logo for early New Jersey synth-pop band WKGB and drew the cover for the band's 1979 single "Non-Stop/Ultramarine" on [[Fetish Records]] (UK Fetish 002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hyped2death.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=354|title= WKGB -Non-Stop|year= 2013|publisher= Hyped to Death|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130730175520/http://hyped2death.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=354|archivedate= July 30, 2013|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|accessdate= June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early work appeared in the pages of ''Heavy Metal'', ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'', ''Bizarre Adventures'', [[Scholastic Corporation]]'s ''Weird Worlds'' and ''Bananas'' illustrating stories written by Goosebumps founder and author [[R. L. Stine]], and he worked with Rick Veitch on the graphic novelization of Steven Spielberg's motion picture ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]''.&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt;

=== Horror master ===
Bissette is best known for his multiple award-winning collaboration with writer [[Alan Moore]] and inker [[John Totleben]] on [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Swamp Thing (comic book)|Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'' (1983–1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 206|quote = [Alan] Moore, with help from artists Stephen R.

Under the company name of '''Spiderbaby Grafix''', he later published the [[horror fiction|horror]] [[comics anthology|anthology]] ''[[Taboo (comics)|Taboo]]'', the original home of Moore and [[Eddie Campbell]]'s ''[[From Hell]]'' and [[Tim Lucas]]' ''Throat Sprockets'' illustrated by Mike Hoffman and David Lloyd. He created ''[[Tyrant (Spiderbaby Grafix)|Tyrant]]'', a comic book biography of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'',&lt;ref name="Lambiek"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bissette_stephen.htm|title= Stephen R.

During this period, he edited the horror anthology ''[[Gore Shriek]]'', published by [[FantaCo Enterprises]].

Since 1991, Bissette has presented a lecture series on horror comics called "Journeys into Fear". Having since grown in scope into a five-part series, "Journeys into Fear" identifies 12th Century Japanese ghost scrolls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_collection/index.php?controller=dtl&amp;colid=A10476&amp;lang=en|title= Scroll of Hungry Ghosts|year= 2009 |publisher= [[Tokyo National Museum]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120927215157/http://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_collection/index.php?controller=dtl&amp;colid=A10476&amp;lang=en|archivedate= September 27, 2012|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|accessdate= May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kyohaku.go.jp/eng/syuzou/meihin/kaiga/emaki/item03.html|title= Gaki-zoshi (Scroll of the Hungry Ghosts)|year= 2009|publisher= [[Kyoto National Museum]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130216103709/http://www.kyohaku.go.jp//eng/syuzou/meihin/kaiga/emaki/item03.html|archivedate= February 16, 2013|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|accessdate= May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 16th Century [[Mixtec codices]] as early ancestors, and traces the genre from its roots in [[Winsor McCay]]'s work such as ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]''.&lt;ref name=cbr2792&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=2792|title= A Horrific View of Comics: A chat with Stephen Bissette|first= Jonah|last= Weiland|date= October 29, 2003|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121012140739/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=2792|archivedate= October 12, 2012|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fantasiafest.com/2005/en/films/film_detail.php?id=98|title= Stephen R.

=== Other work ===

Bissette subsequently worked with Moore, Totleben, and Rick Veitch on the [[Image Comics]]' limited series ''[[1963 (comics)|1963]]'', their final creative collaborative effort.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Larsen quoted in {{cite web|last= Johnston|first= Rich|authorlink= Rich Johnston|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=18264&amp;page=article|title= Lying in the Gutters Volume 2 Column 177|publisher= Comic Book Resources|date= September 29, 2008|quote= Same thing happened in a sense – to ''1963''.

[[Scott McCloud]]'s [[24-hour comic]] project began as a dare to Bissette in 1990. Each created a 24-page comic in 24 hours. The 24-hour comics project evolved into a challenge taken up by numerous hopeful contributors, with several published collections, and inspired other time-limited creative projects. Bissette published the story ''A Life in black and white'' in his own comic book anthology ''SpiderBaby Comix'' #2 (SpiderBaby Graphix, 1997). 

In 1993, Bissette co-edited with Stanley Wiater ''Comic Book Rebels: Conversations with the Creators of the New Comics'' (Dutton, {{ISBN|1-55611-355-2}}), which featured interviews with such notable comics creators as Scott McCloud, [[Harvey Pekar]], [[Dave Sim]], [[Howard Cruse]], [[Will Eisner]], [[Peter Laird]], [[Kevin Eastman]], and [[Robert Crumb]].&lt;ref name=WiaterBissette1993&gt;{{cite book|last1= Wiater|first1= Stan|last2= Bissette|first2= Stephen R.|title=Comic book rebels: conversations with the creators of the new comics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6MNAQAAMAAJ|date=June 1993|publisher=Donald I.

=== Retirement and teaching ===
Bissette retired from the comics industry in 1999, alluding to what he termed a "generational shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/071405/comics.html|title= Monster magnate: Stephen R.

This is a [[timeline]] of [[planetarium]]s:

==Historic influences==
{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5"
|- valign="top"
| 1500 BCE || Egyptian tomb of [[Senenmut]]—earliest known depiction of the sky
|- valign="top"
| 500 BCE || “The Dome of Heaven”—oldest known domed building built by the Etruscans
|- valign="top"
| 428/427 – 348/347 BCE || Greek philosopher [[Plato]] discusses his [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which most humans perceive reality as shadows from projections on the inside of an enclosed space. It is by looking at these projected shadows of objects (and not the objects themselves) that most people try to best understand the world.
|- valign="top"
| 370 BCE || [[Farnese atlas|Farnese Atlas]], probably the oldest preserved globe is now at the National Museum of Naples. The statue of Atlas is dated 73 BCE The position of the constellation figures to the globe's equinox date the globe itself to 370 BCE Two other celestial globes believed to date from Classical times are the [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/astrologysources/classicalgreece/kugelglobe/&amp;date=2009-10-25+12:45:02 Kugel globe], and the  [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/astrologysources/roman/mainzerglobus/&amp;date=2009-10-25+12:45:16 Mainz globe].  
|- valign="top"
| 250 BCE || [[Archimedes]] first to demonstrate a cast-metal globe showing the motions of the planets. After he was killed by invading Romans, the device was taken to Rome as booty where it was seen and described by [[Cicero]]. Later, [[Ptolemy]]’s globe is alleged to have even demonstrated the precession of the equinoxes.
|- valign="top"
| 50 BCE || The [[Hathor temple]] at [[Dendera]] dates from Ptolemaic times, probably the 1st century BCE The temple contains two well-known, but slightly different representations of the heavens. There is a round zodiac ceiling and a square zodiac in the outer [[hypostyle]] hall. The round zodiac ceiling shows the whole sky as it was understood by both Greek and Egyptian cultures.
|- valign="top"
| 62 CE || The [[Golden House of Nero]] includes a dome rotating with the sky. 
|- valign="top"
| 124 CE || [[Pantheon, Rome|Roman Pantheon]] constructed
|- valign="top"
| 150 CE || [[Ptolemy]]’s Celestial Globe. No globe has been found, but detailed notes its on construction have.
|- valign="top"
| 531 CE || “Palace of Chosros” at [[Ctesiphon]], near modern Baghdad, Iraq, whose massive 85-foot-high brick arch was said to be painted with stars against a blue background, indicating the zodiac.
|- valign="top"
| 1229 || [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] brings to Italy a tent captured during the [[Fifth Crusade]]. Now lost, the tent had a cupola-shaped roof with a clockwork mechanism showing moving constellations.&lt;ref name="ley196502"&gt;{{Cite magazine

|- valign="top"
| 1584 || Celestial Globe of [[Tycho Brahe]]. Covered with brass and a wood interior measuring six feet in diameter. Destroyed by fire in 1728, the outer surface was divided by circles to show degrees and minutes and stars visible with the naked eye. A disadvantage to earlier globes was that they showed the sky in reverse, the observer could only view the stars as seen outside the planetsphere.
|- valign="top"
| 1654 || [[Globe of Gottorf]], constructed in the middle of the 17th century, was about four meters in diameter, weighed over three tons, and could seat several persons inside on a circular bench. The stars were holes in the globe. Rebuilt 1748–52.
|- valign="top"
| 18th century || Navajo 'Star Ceilings' painted by hand and with 'paint arrows' on overhanging cliff faces in Canyon De Chelly 
|- valign="top"
| 1744 || [[Eise Eisinga]]’s [[planetarium]] (actually an [[orrery]]) in Franeker, province of Friesland, The Netherlands, is the oldest working one in the world. It was built in the years 1774–1781.
|- valign="top"
| 1846 || [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss Company]] founded. Zeiss produced microscopes in his home workshop. Later collaboration with Ernst Abbe resulted in the first optical instruments produced from theory and plans, rather than from trial and error. Later still, Otto Schott, a glassmaker, introduced a process for producing good quality optical glass reliably, and the company established its reputation as a maker of high-quality optical goods.
|- valign="top"
| 1912 ||  Orbitoscope invented by Prof. E. Hindermann in Basel. (Note: This instrument is driven by springworks and has two planets revolving about a central Sun. A small light bulb on one of the planets projects shadows of the other two objects in the directions they would be seen from that planet, reproducing accurately the retrograde loops and speed changes. This ingenious device is useful for instruction, but of course had many shortcomings)
|- valign="top"
| 1913 || Atwood Globe built in the Museum of the Chicago Academy of Sciences. With a diameter of almost five meters the Atwood globe shows 692 stars, and a moveable light bulb represents the Sun. Apertures along the ecliptic, which can be uncovered as necessary, represent the planets.

| || The idea of realistically reproducing the sky in detail is due to astronomer (and then privy counselor) Max Wolf. He was involved with the Deutsches Museum. Wolf had suggested to von Miller the idea of a device for his museum which would reproduce not only the stars but also the planetary motions. Von Miller approached the well-known optical firm of Carl Zeiss in Jena, and they agreed to look into the problem.

==Development of modern planetariums==

| 1919 || Walther Bauersfeld, chief design engineer and later director of Carl Zeiss, hit upon the idea of projection of the celestial objects in a dark room. The original plan had been for some sort of globe similar to that of the 1654 [[Globe of Gottorf]]. The new idea simplified things immensely. The mechanism could be on a small scale and easily controllable. Five years of calculations and trials were needed to bring this idea to fruition. Five years, in which Bauersfeld and a large staff of scientists, engineers, and draftsmen considered the astronomical principles involved and the mechanical devices which would realize them. They constructed star plates of film with images of 4500 stars. They found ways of interconnecting the daily and annual motion drives so the planets would stay in proper relative positions. In short they invented the modern projection planetarium.

| || [[Elis Stromgren]] wrote: “Never before was an instrument created which is so instructive as this; never before one so bewitching; and never before did an instrument speak so directly to the beholder. The machine itself is precious and aristocratic… The planetarium is school, theater, and cinema in one classroom under the eternal dome of the sky.”

In 1928, Max Adler, a Chicago philanthropist, heard of the “Wonder of Jena” and took his wife and an architect to Germany to see it. He was so impressed, he donated to his home city the first planetarium in the Americas. On May 12, 1930, the [[Adler Planetarium]] greeted its first visitors.

| 1949 || In May, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080331063648/http://www.moreheadplanetarium.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page&amp;filename=history1.html Morehead Planetarium] opened on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus; it is the first planetarium on a university campus in the United States. Spitz Laboratories was founded, first in an old factory building and then in an old theater. The first Spitz projector was demonstrated to a meeting of astronomers at Harvard College Observatory in the late-1940s. As the enterprise grew, they later moved to an old snuff factory in Yorklyn, Delaware, and are now located in a spacious new factory in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. The company has changed its corporate ownership several times in its brief history and is now owned by Evans &amp; Sutherland.
|- valign="top"
| 1952 || After the war neither of Zeiss’s two main factories in Oberkochen and Jena were capable of building a planetarium projector. Because of this, the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in San Francisco commissioned a comparable, one-of-a-kind projector for the [[Morrison Planetarium at California Academy of Sciences|Morrison Planetarium]]. After four years of design and construction, it was opened on November 6.  While all earlier planetariums (and nearly all subsequent) show only the planets from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] through [[Saturn]], this one-of-a-kind projector also shows the planet [[Uranus]], usually not counted as being of naked eye visibility, and so left out of planetarium projections.

After trials in Japan, the first Goto in the United States filled the sky with stars in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on January 20, 1962. The Goto company was actually the first to produce a small projector which included planetary motions. Many Goto instruments have since been installed all over the world, a large number in the U.S.A.

|- valign="top"
| 1965 || Minolta Company of Japan, known for high-quality cameras and optics, made some tentative entries into the field in the mid-1960s. Their first planetarium was at DeAnza College in California. By the late 1960s, Minolta had decided to officially enter the planetarium business.
|- valign="top"
| 1966  || Phillip Stern, a former lecturer at the Hayden Planetarium and director of the Bridgeport Planetarium, develops the first programmable planetarium, the Apollo model.  Unable to finance this himself, he has a small audio-visual firm on [[Long Island]], Viewlex, manufacture and market the planetarium, mostly to schools.  Later this is joined by the first model to be portable, with an inflatable dome.

'''Victor Marlborough Silvester''' [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (25 February 1900&lt;ref&gt;The date of the [[relief of Mafeking]], and the probable reason for his first name. (autobiog.)&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}14 August 1978) was an English dancer, author, musician and [[bandleader]] from the [[British dance band]] era. He was a significant figure in the development of [[ballroom dance]] during the first half of the 20th century, and his records sold 75 million copies from the 1930s through to the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Derek B. 2004. Silvester, Victor Marlborough (1900–1978), in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silvester, Victor Marlborough (1900-1978) in ''Who Was Who'', A&amp;C Black, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Allmusic'': Victor Silvester {{cite web|last=Eder |first=Bruce |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p41550/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Victor Silvester &gt; Biography|publisher=allmusic |date= |accessdate=14 May 2010}} (includes some inaccuracies)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:Ardingly College, Sussex.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ardingly College]]]]
Silvester was born the second son of a [[vicar]] in [[Wembley]], [[Middlesex]]. He was educated at [[Ardingly College]], [[St. John's School, Leatherhead]] and [[John Lyon School]], [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], from all of which he absconded. In September 1916 he enlisted in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]] and served as a private in the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]. He lied about his age to the recruiting authorities, stating this as 20 when in fact he was only 16. He took part in the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] in April/May 1917, and also was a member of five execution squads, where deserters, some no doubt suffering from shell-shock, were shot.&lt;ref&gt;George Macintyre, "Doomed Youth: how the tragedy of 250,000 boy soldiers in the trenches was covered up", ''The Journal'', Newcastle upon Tyne, 14 June 2004 {{cite web |url=http://study.abingdon.org.uk/history/boy_soldiers.html |title=update |publisher=Study.abingdon.org.uk |date=14 June 2004 |accessdate=14 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717054233/http://study.abingdon.org.uk/history/boy_soldiers.html |archive-date=17 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatwar.nl/children/silvester.html ''Children of the Great War'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Once his age was discovered, he was immediately withdrawn from the front and sent back to the military base at [[Etaples]]. After two weeks he was transferred to the First British Ambulance Unit For Italy. On 4 September 1917 at Sella di Dol near San Gabriele, while acting as a stretcher bearer to evacuate wounded Italian servicemen during a heavy bombardment by the Austrians and Germans, he was injured in the leg by a shell burst but refused medical treatment until the other wounded had been attended to. For his gallantry on this occasion he was awarded the Italian [[Bronze Medal of Military Valour]] in a decree by the Italian Minister of War dated 30 November 1917. In a letter to Silvester's parents dated 20 September 1917, his Commandant in the First British Ambulance Unit, the noted historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]], wrote: "He is certainly one who will be deservedly loved wherever he goes in life, and he is besides made of sterling stuff."&lt;ref&gt;Victor Silvester - 'Dancing Is My Life' (1958) plus original war service documents and G.M. Trevelyan correspondence in the Victor Silvester Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war he studied at [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] for a year. He decided to resume a military career when he was offered a place at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], but he quickly decided it was not for him. He also studied music at [[Trinity College, London]], having already had private piano lessons as a child.

== Career in dance ==
His interests had meanwhile turned to dancing. He was one of the first post-war English dancers to feature the full [[Natural Turn|natural turn]] in the slow [[Waltz (International Standard)|waltz]]. This innovation was a factor in his winning the first [[World Ballroom Dance Champions|World Ballroom Dancing Championship]] in 1922 with Phyllis Clarke as his partner. He married Dorothy Newton a few days later.&lt;ref name="Victor" /&gt;

He competed again in 1924, coming second to Maxwell Stewart – the inventor of the [[double reverse spin]] in the waltz – and Barbara Miles. He was a founding member of the Ballroom Committee of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]] which codified the theory and practice of [[Ballroom Dance]] – now known as the [[Ballroom glossary#International Style|International Style]] – and published the first book embodying the new standards in 1927. This was ''Modern Ballroom Dancing'', which became a best-seller and has remained in print through many editions, the last issued in 2005.

He went on to open a dancing academy in London, which eventually developed into a chain of 23 dance studios. By the early 1930s his teaching had become famous and he had taught some of the top celebrities of the day, among whom was Estelle Thompson, better known as [[Merle Oberon]].&lt;ref name="Victor"&gt;Victor Silvester 1958. ''Dancing Is My Life: The Autobiography of Victor Silvester''. Heinemann, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Victor had his own BBC television show through the 1950s, called ''BBC Dancing Club'', and was later the President of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]].

== Career in music ==
The lack of what he felt were adequate records for dancing led Silvester in 1935 to form his own five-piece band, later enlarged and named ''Victor Silvester and his Ballroom Orchestra'', whose first record, "You're Dancing on My Heart" (by Al Bryan and George M. Meyer), sold 17,000 copies and was to become his signature tune. He insisted his recordings conform precisely to the beats per minute recommended by the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]] for ballroom dances, a concept termed "strict tempo". In British eyes he became indelibly associated with the catch-phrase "slow, slow, quick-quick-slow" – a rhythm that occurs in the [[foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]] and [[quickstep]].

The Silvester band always had a distinctive sound, achieved by an unusual line-up including, as well as the usual rhythm section, alto saxophone (initially Charlie Spinelli and later, for 26 years, Edward Owen "Poggy" Pogson, who had previously played in Jack Payne's and Jack Hylton's bands), a lead solo violin (for many years usually Oscar Grasso), and not one but two pianos, one taking turn in solos and the other maintaining an improvised tinkling continuo in the background throughout every piece, which Silvester called his "lemonade". This piano sound is said to have been created for him by the pianist/ later bandleader and BBC radio star Felix King.

He notes in his autobiography that his first two pianists in 1935 were Gerry Moore for the melody and Felix King for the "lemonade". Later pianists included, at different times, Monia Liter, Charlie Pude, Jack Phillips, Billy Munn, Victor Parker (also accordion), Ernest "Slim" Wilson (who was also Silvester's main arranger, and with whom he co-wrote several pieces), Eddie Macauley and Ronnie Taylor. Silvester's drummer for over four decades was Ben Edwards, crucial for supplying the strict tempo. Sometimes there might be four saxophones altogether, two alto and two tenor, including in latter years Tony Mozr, Percy Waterhouse and Phil Kirby in addition to Pogson, all doubling on clarinet as required. On some recordings, the Ballroom Orchestra was augmented with 15 strings and woodwind, when it became "The Silver Strings". During the war, when Oscar Grasso was in the forces, the classical violinist [[Alfredo Campoli]] took his place, using the name "Alfred Campbell" for contractual reasons.&lt;ref name="Victor" /&gt;

These were first-class players, some of whom (like Liter, Grasso and Pogson) were already noted in jazz or danceband circles before they joined Silvester's band. Unlike most British dance bands of the era, there were no vocals. Silvester usually did not play (he was a violinist), but stood in front of his orchestra in white tie and tails, conducting with a flourish.

He would continue to make music for half a century, mostly covering the [[Traditional pop music|popular music standards]] and show tunes, sometimes (but rarely) [[swing (music)|swing]], [[trad jazz]] and in latter years, especially from 1971 when the orchestra continued under his son Victor Silvester Jr, [[rock and roll]], [[disco]] and [[pop music|pop]]. These later attempts to stay "with it" involved the introduction of an electric guitar, but it is mostly the more melodic recordings of the 1940s and 1950s that are now reissued on CD and still sold widely.

=== Competition ===
Silvester's record sales were so huge that competition was inevitable. Other dancers were attracted to the idea, and set up their own strict-tempo bands. Henry Jacques, Maxwell Stewart, [[Josephine Bradley]] and Wally Fryer were all top-flight dancers who set up in competition to Silvester. There were other bands led by musicians who were capable of recording in strict time. The best for ballroom competitions was probably [[Joe Loss]], who had an even longer musical career than Silvester. Other bands that catered to ballroom dancing were [[Oscar Rabin]] and [[Jack Harris (musician)|Jack Harris]], whose band played in clubs and restaurants through the 1930s, [[Phil Tate]], and [[Jack Parnell]]. For the post-war period of Latin dances to (mostly) [[Cuba]]n and [[Brazil]]ian rhythms, [[Edmundo Ros]] was in a class of his own.

== Later life ==
By 1958, when he published his autobiography, he was the most successful dance band leader in British musical history, and a major star on British radio and television. His BBC Television show ''Dancing Club'' lasted 17 years. He also presented a weekly request programme on the [[BBC Overseas Service]] (later [[World Service]]) which ran from 1948 to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;"Victor Silvester's BBC Dancing Club", ''WW2 People's War'', BBC website {{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/02/a8054002.shtml |title=WW2 People's War - Victor Silvester's 'BBC Dancing Club' |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=14 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307022455/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/02/a8054002.shtml |archive-date=7 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' noted, "Turn on a radio in Famagusta, Cape Town or Peking and one would be likely to hear his music issuing from the speakers".&lt;ref&gt;"Mr Victor Silvester: doyen of ballroom dancing" (obituary), ''The Times'', London, 15 August 1978, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1957 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC Television Theatre.

Victor Silvester was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1961. He died while on holiday in the south of France at the age of 78. The orchestra remained in existence under his son's direction until the 1990s. Victor, his wife and son are memorialised at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], London.

The Victor Silvester Archive - which includes his OBE and First World War medals and related original documents and correspondence, his many other accolades such as his four [[Carl Alan Award]]s for services to dancing and his BBC Radio Golden Microphone Award, the complete archive of programme sheets for his orchestra's BBC broadcasts, platinum and silver discs for his orchestra's record sales and the orchestra's entire archive of original hand-scored strict tempo sheet music - was sold at auction in London in March 2000 and is now held in a private collection in [[Northern England]].

'''Workshops for Careers in the Arts''' was a [[professional training]] program especially designed for artistically talented teenagers which took place on the campus of [[The George Washington University]] in a joint collaboration. Designated a pilot program, Workshops for Careers in the Arts was created in June 1968 by [[Peggy Cooper Cafritz]] and Mike Malone as a means toward the establishment of a [[public high school]] for [[the arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].

There were three departments in the school program at the start of its formation. They were in [[Drama]]/[[Theatre]], [[Dance]], and [[Visual Arts]]/[[Painting]]. These departments serviced qualified area students after their normal home school day, on weekends during the academic year, and full time during the summer months. Roughly ninety (90) students were enrolled during the inaugural years. Funding eventually became increasingly available as [[lobbying]], [[grants]], [[Matriculation|enrollment]], [[contributions]], and stellar reputations regarding the program significantly increased.

Students were accepted on the basis of recommendations from area Principals, Teachers, Parents, interviews, and auditions. Talented students who could not otherwise afford such training were given top priority. Workshops for Careers in the Arts enrolled and had diverse students from all over the Washington Metropolitan region. No student was required to pay a tuition.

Upon leaving the program, the students were encouraged to continue their career training. Workshops for Careers in the Arts students began to achieve collegiate full [[scholarships]] and receive [[contracts]] toward higher education. The George Washington University, The Washington School of Ballet, The North Carolina School of the Arts, The Juilliard School and Howard University were some of the very first illustrious [[institutions]] to receive Workshops for Careers in the Arts [[graduates]]. Some graduates had opportunities to start professional careers in their field soon after their departure from the program.

Workshops for Careers in the Arts showed the need for and the results of specialized [[vocational training]] in the arts. As more successful Workshops for Careers in the Arts years past, which included the need for an additional space location on Georgia Avenue at Morton Street, N.W., the Washington community made this opportunity available to their young people on a much broader scale. In the process during 1974, the Duke Ellington High School at Western High School in Washington, D.C. was born. The goal was achieved.

[[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]] was established as an [[accredited]] four (4) year public high school [[curriculum]], combining arts and [[academics]] in the Nation's Capital.

Thanks to the brilliant Staff, Faculty, Students, and Alumni of Workshops for Careers in the Arts.
