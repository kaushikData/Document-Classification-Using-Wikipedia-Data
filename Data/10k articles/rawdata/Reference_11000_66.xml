An '''aircraft safety card''' is a document instructing passengers on an aircraft about the procedures for dealing with various emergency conditions that might arise during the flight.

==General Information==

{{no footnotes|date=May 2018}}
[[File:20180205 050721 germania airlines.jpg|thumb|A [[Germania Airlines]] safety instruction card for the [[Boeing 737]].]]

The safety cards are usually provided by [[airline]]s on all commercial flights, usually located in the back of the [[Airline seat|seat]] in front of each passenger, or alternatively a placard on the back of seats. [[Pre-flight safety demonstration]]s, either conducted by the [[flight attendant]]s or through a video presentation, instruct passengers to familiarize themselves with the safety cards prior to take-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52181820|title=Design for impact|last=Eric.|first=Ericson,|date=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|others=Pihl, Johan.|isbn=1568983875|edition=[1st ed.]|location=New York|oclc=52181820}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cards are frequently [[laminate]]d or made of [[plastic]] and contain instructions that are specific to the model of the airplane in which they are found. The contents are usually in the form of pictures, graphically illustrating such procedures as buckling the [[seat belt]]s, [[Brace position|bracing for impact]] in an airplane crash, dealing with [[cabin pressurization|depressurization]], opening the [[emergency exit]] door or inflating life rafts in the event of a [[water landing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10272830|title=Just in case : a passenger's guide to airplane safety and survival|last=1937-|first=Johnson, Daniel A.,|date=1984|publisher=Plenum|isbn=0306415763|location=New York|oclc=10272830}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic representation allows the cards to be accessible to those speaking a different [[language]] from the flight attendants, as well as to children and illiterate passengers. [[Braile]] cards are also offered on many mainstream airlines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://runwaygirlnetwork.com/2017/12/26/from-staid-to-funky-inflight-safety-card-design-sends-a-brand-message/|title=From staid to funky, inflight safety card design sends a brand message - Runway Girl|date=2017-12-26|work=Runway Girl|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collectibles==

Aircraft safety cards are a [[collectible]] item among the [[Aircraft spotting|aviation enthusiast community]] since they are a reflection of an airline, an aircraft type, a culture, and a historical period. Safety cards are collected from Civil and Military aircraft, rare cards have been known to fetch over 1000 USD at auction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''AlgaeBase''' is a [[Global Species Database]] of information on all groups of [[algae]],&lt;ref name="TIS"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.irishscientist.ie/2005/contents.asp?contentxml=05p74-75.xml&amp;contentxsl=is05page74.xsl |title=AlgaeBase — listing the world's algae |author=Michael Guiry |year=2005 |pages=74–75 |journal=[[The Irish Scientist]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100854/http://www.irishscientist.ie/2005/contents.asp?contentxml=05p74-75.xml&amp;contentxsl=is05page74.xsl |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one group of [[flowering plant]]s, the [[Seagrass|sea-grasses]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algaebase.org/about/ |title=What is AlgaeBase? |publisher=AlgaeBase|author=M.

AlgaeBase evolved from Michael Guiry's seaweed website, and has grown into a database of algae from throughout the world, and in [[freshwater]], [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], and [[brackish]] as well as [[ocean|marine]] habitats.&lt;ref name="TIS"/&gt; By 2005, the database contained about 65,000 names,&lt;ref name="TIS"/&gt; and by September 2006, 122,240 species and infraspecific names were in the database, with 5,826 images, 38,290 bibliographic items, 138,706 distributional records.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Currently, the data for the marine algae, particularly seaweeds, are the most complete.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} About 30,000 species of algae are included, of which the [[Rhodophyta]] (6000 species), marine [[Chlorophyta]] (1500 species), and [[Phaeophyceae]] (1755 species) are the most complete. The [[diatoms]] and the smaller [[freshwater]] green algae are currently (August 2010) the most incomplete groups.

[[Mathematical programming|Programming]] is carried out by VisualID (http://www.visualid.com) (Pier Kuipers and Caoilte Guiry) and the compilation of the data was funded by the Irish Government Department of Education and Science's [[PRTLI]] 3 and 4 programmes (http://www.hea.ie/en/prtli).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16952">{{nihongo|'''Alien registration'''|外国人登録|gaikokujin tōroku}} was a system used to record information regarding [[Alien (law)|alien]]s resident in [[Japan]]. It was handled at the [[municipalities of Japan|municipal]] level, parallel to (but separately from) the [[koseki]] (family register) and [[juminhyo]] (resident register) systems used to record information regarding Japanese nationals.

Foreigners staying in [[Japan]] for more than 90 days (excluding military personnel under a [[status of forces agreement]] and diplomatic personnel) were required to register&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/13.html Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan; A Guide to Japanese Visas XIII. Procedures After Entry into JapanAlien registration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410153615/http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/13.html |date=2008-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; within 90 days of landing in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tarl-02.html Ministry of Justice; The Alien Registration Law (PROVISIONAL TRANSLATION) Article 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; The applicant was required to provide a completed application form, passport (for applicants 16 years old or older) and two identification photos. The system was voluntary for shorter-term visitors.

Alien registration was a prerequisite to many activities in Japan, such as purchasing a mobile phone, opening a bank account or obtaining a driver's license.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

As described [[Alien registration in Japan#Foreign residents' registration system|below]], the alien registration system was replaced with a foreign residents' registration system on July 9, 2012. The new system of foreign resident registration was passed from the local municipal level to the national level.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite web | title = New Immigration law takes effect in July | publisher = Japan Times | url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111221a5.html &lt;!-- | date = | accessdate = --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ImmigTop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="immig"&gt;[http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_1/pdf/NewResidencyManagementSystem-(EN).pdf Immigration Bureau booklet on new residency management system]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SoumuAnnounce&gt;[http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/jichi_gyousei/c-gyousei/zairyu_english.html　Changes to the Basic Resident Registration Law — Internal Affairs Dep't]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soumu"&gt;[http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/jichi_gyousei/c-gyousei/pdf/eng_page.pdf Internal Affairs Department booklet on new resident registration system]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Registered information ==
The information stored in the alien registration system included:

* Date of registration
* Name (including any legal alias)
* Date of birth
* Gender
* Nationality and place of residence in home country
* Place of birth
* Employer/school, work/school address and occupation (if any)
* Passport number and date of issuance
* Date of landing in Japan
* Status of residence and duration of stay
* Residential address
* Information regarding household members (including name, date of birth, nationality and relationship)
* Information regarding parent(s) and/or spouse residing in Japan.

This information was recorded in a physical document called a {{nihongo|''tōroku genpyō''|登録原票}}, kept by the municipality in which the subject lived. Any changes in registered information had to be reported to the municipal office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tokyo-icc.jp/guide_eng/proce/02.html Legal Procedures for Your Residence in Japan: Alien Registration]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a resident alien moved within Japan, they were required to report their move to the new municipality of residence, which then took possession of the ''tōroku genpyō''. The ''tōroku genpyō'' was closed when the alien left Japan without a re-entry permit, and was then kept in an archive at the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]]. Any subsequent entry to Japan by the same person required a new registration which was kept on a new ''tōroku genpyō''.

== Alien registration card ==
After a person registered as an alien, they were issued a photographic [[identity document]] called a {{Nihongo|Certificate of Alien Registration|外国人登録証明書|gaikokujin tōroku shōmeisho}}, abbreviated (as is [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words|common in Japan]]) to {{Nihongo||外登証|gaitōshō}},&lt;!-- see ja:WP for use, for example --&gt; and colloquially referred to in English as an "alien registration card" ("ARC") or "[[gaijin]] card." All aliens in Japan were required to carry their passport or ARC at all times.&lt;!-- ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/13.html A Guide to Japanese Visas - Procedures After Entry into Japan]&lt;/ref --&gt; The issuance of an ARC generally took about two weeks from the filing of the application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studyjapan.go.jp/en/faq/faq03e.html Study in Japan Comprehensive Guide: FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alien registration could also be evidenced by a {{Nihongo|certificate of matters in the alien registration records|外国人登録原票記載事項証明書|gaikokujin tōroku genpyō kisai jikō shōmeisho}}, which is an [[paper size|A4-sized]] printed copy of the information currently on file, similar in form to the [[Jūminhyō|residency registration]] certificates used by Japanese nationals. Because this form of certificate did not contain the subject's photograph, it was not as widely accepted as the ARC for identity verification purposes, and was mainly used as a temporary certificate when an ARC was unavailable.

The ARC had to be surrendered when the foreigner left Japan unless they had a valid re-entry permit in their passport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/tetuduki/index.html Immigration Bureau: Immigration Procedures Guidebook: Immigration Control Procedures for All foreign nationals: Departure Procedures foreign nationals]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal alias ==
Registered aliens are allowed to adopt an {{nihongo|alias|通称名|tsūshōmei}} or [[:ja:通名|通名]] as a second legal name. This resembles the [[:ja:通称|通称]] that Japanese are allowed to use — for example, to continue using a maiden name at work and on bank accounts after marriage. Foreigners who are long-term residents of Japan, particularly [[Koreans in Japan|ethnic Koreans]] whose families have lived in Japan for generations, often adopt [[Japanese name]]s as aliases in order to integrate within society. [[Japanese diaspora|Ethnic Japanese]] who live in Japan as resident aliens may use a legal alias to reflect their ancestral name. Legal aliases are also used when registering a [[Seal (east Asia)|seal]] in a different script than the applicant's legal name (e.g., in [[katakana]] rather than Latin script).

A person is generally required to use their alias in public relations before registering it. The exact criteria vary by locality, but the most common evidence is mail addressed to the alias name. One common technique which applicants use to create this evidence is to label the [[post box]] at their registered residence using the alias, and then mail themselves a postcard or letter addressed to the alias. One may also pay one's [[NHK]] television fee under the alias, and then receive official bills using that alias.

Aliases may be registered upon initial alien registration. If the alias is registered subsequently, upon registration of the alias, the registrant receives a handwritten notation indicating the legal alias on the reverse side of their alien registration card. Any registration certificate which is subsequently issued will show the alias in type in parentheses just below the holder's name.

A registered alias may be used on [[credit cards]], [[health insurance]], [[bank accounts]] and other documents. However, such documents may cause difficulties in foreign countries where the holder does not have personal identification showing their Japanese alias; thus documents in the registrant's foreign name may be preferable in non-Japanese speaking locales. Foreigners may obtain a Japanese credit card with a photo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smbc-card.com/vp/meisai.do Sumitomo Mitsui Visa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese nationals often use aliases for non-official purposes. For example, women often continue to use their maiden names following marriage, even though they are required to adopt the same family name as their husband for their legal name. However, Japanese nationals are not permitted to use an alias for legal purposes: their name on any official document (e.g. domestic use Japanese identification) must match the name appearing in their family register and resident register. Japanese passports may contain alternate names in parentheses next to the family name or the given name if the Japanese can show a legal connection and use of these names overseas. Multiple alternate names are separated by slashes. Non-standard non-[[Hepburn romanization]] may also be used for the main names if one can show a legal connection using these spellings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seikatubunka.metro.tokyo.jp/hebon/index.html Passport Hepburn and alternate name rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030223252/http://www.seikatubunka.metro.tokyo.jp/hebon/index.html |date=2012-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

=== Fingerprinting debate ===
From 1952 onward, alien registration required the applicant to provide [[fingerprint]]s from all fingers. Resident Koreans and other groups opposed this provision as a [[human rights]] violation. [[Kathleen Morikawa]] saw fingerprinting as violating the [[Golden Rule]] and fought for a level playing field. The fingerprinting system was repealed for [[Special Permanent Resident (Japan)|Special Permanent Resident]]s in the 1980s and for other aliens in 1999.

The fingerprint law was described in an [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] report, ''Prevention of Discrimination: The Rights of Non-Citizens'' (final report of the [[United Nations special rapporteur|special rapporteur]] David Weissbrodt), as follows:

{{quote|"An amendment to the Japanese Alien Registration Law recently abolished a fingerprint requirement to which all non-citizens had been subject. The revision of the law relieved about 600,000 residents from having to register their fingerprints. Instead, they will be asked to file their signatures or the names of their family members. Although the fingerprint law (was) repealed, foreigners are still required to carry their alien registration cards at all times and violators face heavy penalties including incarceration for up to three years or fines of up to 300,000 yen. This requirement (was) widely condemned abroad."|source=Prevention of Discrimination: The Rights of Non-Citizens&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/e06a5300f90fa0238025668700518ca4/a80788bbc13a7676c1256be90035b864/$FILE/G0213907.pdf Prevention of Discrimination: The Rights of Non-Citizens] (final report of the special rapporteur David Weissbrodt)], Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.{{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Japanese government has since introduced fingerprinting and photographing of foreigners, claiming that this is a [[terrorism]] control measure. Fingerprinting is conducted at the immigration checkpoint when entering Japan and is only conducted using the two [[index finger]]s. Japanese nationals and [[Special Permanent Resident (Japan)|Special Permanent Resident]]s are exempt from the procedure; long-term residency holders are requested to give fingerprint scans regardless.

When enforced, 95 people out of 700,000 who had entered Japan in one month were refused entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japanprobe.com/2007/12/26/95-foreigners-refused-entry-since-nov-20-start-of-fingerprinting-system/ |title=Foreigners denied entry for refusing fingerprinting |access-date=2010-06-19 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912093826/http://www.japanprobe.com/2007/12/26/95-foreigners-refused-entry-since-nov-20-start-of-fingerprinting-system/ |archive-date=2012-09-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation with other registration systems ===
The alien registration system was similar to, but completely separate from, the ''[[koseki]]'' system used to record Japanese families and the ''[[juminhyo]]'' system used to record individual residents. If a household contained any non-Japanese members, those people would not appear in the ''koseki'' or ''juminhyo'' alongside the Japanese members. However, both Japanese and non-Japanese members of a registered alien's family appear in the alien's registration certificate; therefore one alien registration certificate can be used to prove their familial relationship.

One side effect of this situation was that it was impossible for an alien married to a Japanese national to be registered as the head of their household on a ''koseki'' or ''juminhyo''. It was possible, however, to add a footnote to the Japanese spouse's records indicating that the alien is a {{nihongo|''de facto'' head of household|事実上の世帯主|jijitsu-jo no setainushi}}.

==Foreign residents' registration system==
The Japanese government passed a law replacing the alien registration system with a residents' registration system. This new system started from July 9, 2012.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ImmigTop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="immig" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SoumuAnnounce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soumu" /&gt; The changes see non-Japanese residents recorded alongside Japanese residents in the ''[[jūminhyō]]'' system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090226a5.html |title=The Japan Times; Foreigners may be logged in resident registry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401225743/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090226a5.html |archivedate=2009-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note the distinction between the [[koseki]] system, which has not changed, and the [[jūminhyō]]).

Under the new system, foreigners are issued a new identification card known as a {{nihongo|"Residence Card"|在留カード|zairyū kādo}} by immigration authorities. Local city officials stopped issuing Alien Registration Cards and all foreigners are now issued Residence Cards by immigration authorities. Use of the old card was permitted until 8 July 2015, or when the resident's current status expired, whichever came first.

With the system, the maximum length of a status (other than statuses such as ''{{transl|ja|eiju}}'' long-term residence or ''{{transl|ja|teiju}}'' special long-term residence) for foreign residents was extended from three to five years, and shorter periods for Students and dependent statuses are permitted; the maximum length of multiple re-entry permits also has been extended to 5 years (eiju status) or 6 years (teiji), in addition for stays of up to one year, a special re-entry permit can be applied for at the point of departure at no charge rather than having to apply to an Immigration bureau in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_1/en/index.html|title= Guidelines for new residency management system|work=The Ministry of Justice, Japan|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Residency status renewals are automatically reported to City Offices. Immigration Dept. penalties for failing to promptly report changes in address to the City Office may be quite severe.&lt;ref name="ImmigTop"&gt;[http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_1/en/index.html New Residency Management System — Immigration Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120703a8.html Many foreigners not at (registered) addresses] July 3, 2012. Retrieved on July 11, 2012 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706031917/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120703a8.html |date=July 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As was the case for Alien Registration, penalties for not carrying registration cards at all times are still likely to be heavy.

Special Permanent Residents such as special [[Koreans in Japan|Korean residents of Japan]] have a Special Permanent Resident Certificate instead of a Residence Card.

'''Bonnie++''' is a free [[Benchmark (computing)|file system benchmarking tool]] for [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, developed by Russell Coker. Bonnie++ is a benchmark suite that is aimed at performing a number of simple tests of hard drive and file system performance.

== Features ==
Bonnie++ allows you to benchmark how your file systems perform with respect to data read and write speed, the number of seeks that can be performed per second, and the number of file metadata operations that can be performed per second.&lt;ref&gt;Tony.

[[File:Statue touchdown cfhof.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Touchdown'' sculpture.]]
The '''Canadian Football Hall of Fame''' is a [[not-for-profit]] corporation, located in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], that celebrates great achievements in [[Canadian football]]. It is maintained by the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). It includes displays about the CFL, [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport football|Canadian university football]] and [[Canadian Junior Football League|Canadian junior football]] history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/canadian-football-hall-of-fame-and-museum/ "Canadian Football Hall of Fame and Museum"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hall previously had a main feature in the central portion of the [[museum]] where inducted members, each with a metal bust depicting their head, were displayed prior to the physical building being closed. There were also featured displays that highlight each CFL team's history, and an interactive [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] kicking exhibit.  The CFHOF is currently changing to a de-centralized model, which does not included a main museum building (see "Today" below).

Once during every CFL season, the Hall sponsors the induction ceremony of former players. Included in the "Hall of Fame Weekend" is a regular season game, usually (but not always) affiliated with the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]]. Traditionally, the inducted players will come to the Hall and make an acceptance speech in front of the building where their newly sculpted bust is unveiled. A player must be retired from the game for at least three years before being eligible for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfhof.ca/nomination-form/ Canadian Football Hall of Fame Nomination Form], April 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A Hall of Fame voting committee is composed of sports writers, selected CFL executives and inducted members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfhof.ca/selection-committee/ Canadian Football Hall of Fame Selection Committee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214004615/http://cfhof.ca/selection-committee/# |date=2017-02-14 }},  Accessed February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Canadian [[Hall of Fame]] officially opened on November 28, 1972. It is located in downtown [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], beside the former Hamilton City Hall and Family Courts Building, which is inside the former [[Andrew Carnegie]] library on [[Main Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|Main Street]], between [[Bay Street (Hamilton)|Bay Street]] and [[MacNab Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|MacNab Street]]. The Canadian Hall of Fame was awarded to the City of Hamilton in June 1963 following the invitation of Mayor Lloyd Douglas Jackson. The Hamilton Parks Board offered a space near [[Ivor Wynne Stadium|Civic Stadium]]. Ivan Miller, former sports editor of The Spectator, was named the first curator. Soon after, the Board of Education purchased the land and building. The Hall moved to this location in 1972 and closed on September 19, 2015. In 2015, responsibility for the museum moved from the City of Hamilton to the CFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=July 10, 2015|url=http://www.900chml.com/2015/07/10/38953/|title=Canadian Football Hall of Fame will relocate in 2016|last=Urciuoli|first=Anthony|website=AM900 CHML {{!}} Hamilton News|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
The old Canadian Hall of Fame building was easily identified by the slightly-larger-than-life metal [[sculpture]] ''Touchdown'', featuring a successful receiver being tackled.  As of May 2018, this sculpture will be moved to [[Tim Hortons Field]] Gate 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ticats.ca/canadian-football-hall-of-fame-and-museum-to-officially-relaunch-on-club-level-at-tim-hortons-field-in-2018/|title=CANADIAN FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME AND MUSEUM TO OFFICIALLY RELAUNCH ON CLUB LEVEL AT TIM HORTONS FIELD IN 2018 – Hamilton Tiger-Cats|website=ticats.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tim Hortons Field]] will also have 3 display areas - the Grey Cup display at Gate 3, the Media Hall of Fame Wing in the press box area, and the main display area in the premium level concourse.  The main display area will feature all 296 busts (as of March 2018) and rotating displays of various artifacts.  The displays will be accessible during [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] home games (club level display open to all ticket holders 15 minutes after the end of the game), as well as Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings to the public at no charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ticats.ca/canadian-football-hall-of-fame-and-museum-to-officially-relaunch-on-club-level-at-tim-hortons-field-in-2018/|title=CANADIAN FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME AND MUSEUM TO OFFICIALLY RELAUNCH ON CLUB LEVEL AT TIM HORTONS FIELD IN 2018 – Hamilton Tiger-Cats|website=ticats.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CFHOF is also building travelling displays for different CFL team home fields, the Grey Cup, and other events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thespec.com/sports-story/5920302-canadian-football-hall-of-fame-closes-for-the-last-time-saturday/|title=Canadian Football Hall of Fame closes for the last time Saturday|date=2015-09-18|newspaper=The Hamilton Spectator|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Dmitry Cathedral in Vladimir.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cathedral of Saint Demetrius]]
The '''Cathedral of Saint Demetrius''' ([[Russian language|Russian]] Дмитриевский собор) is a cathedral in the ancient Russian city of [[Vladimir (city)|Vladimir]]. It was finished in 1197 during the reign of the Grand Prince [[Vsevolod the Big Nest]] of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] to the honour of Saint [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki]]. Being an important component of the [[White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal]], the cathedral belongs to the [[World Heritage]] of [[UNESCO]]. Currently, the cathedral is a part of the Vladimir-Suzdal open-air museum.

== History ==
The Cathedral of St. Dmitrii in Vladimir, Russia was built by [[Vsevolod the Big Nest|Vsevolod III]] in 1193-7.  It was one of several large churches he had built which also include the much larger [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Cathedral of Dormition]], 1158-60, also in Vladimir, Russia.  The cathedral was dedicated to St. Dmitrii of Salonika ([[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|St. Demetrios]] of Thesseloinka in Greek). The Cathedral of St. Dmitrii was originally connected directly with Vsevolod’s palace and was for his personal use.  The palace no longer exists and the church has been renovated many times since it was first built but it has kept is predominant features and iconographic program.  The most extensive renovation was in 1832 when the some attached structures which used to connect it to the palace were removed.  At that time, some of the exterior blocks were moved and some replaced with newly carved blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Brumfield, W. (1993). A history of Russian architecture. Cambridge ; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, Page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exterior ==
The cathedral is masonry and made from local white limestone blocks.  It is cubic in form similar to many earlier churches in [[Bogolyubovo, Vladimir Oblast|Bogolyubovo]] especially the ''[[Church of the Intercession on the Nerl]]'' (1165).&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, George Heard. The art and architecture of Russia. Penguin Books, 1983, page 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has four columns on the interior which supports drum and cupola.  The exterior walls are separated into three bays each with the one in the middle larger than the others.  Each bay contains a ''[[Russian church architecture|zakomara]]'' at the top. They are also separated at mid-level by a horizontal arcade frieze.  One side of the cathedral contains an apse which is also separated into three parts.  The windows and doors are deeply recessed with extensive carved ornamentation. 

== Carvings ==

The most striking feature of the cathedral are the extensive shallow relief carvings which cover the upper half of the exterior walls above the arcade frieze and the drum below the cupola.  The source of the artisans and provenance for these carvings seems to be an amalgam of many influences.  The most likely are earlier Bogoluiubovo churches, Balkan churches and Armenian churches.&lt;ref&gt;Brumfield, W. (1993). A history of Russian architecture. Cambridge ; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, Page 52&lt;/ref&gt;  Vladimir, at end of the 12th century, was a cosmopolitan and artistic center.  Architects and artisans from both the east and west resided there are were used in the construction of the church.  In addition, Vsevolod’s mother was a Byzantine princess and Vsevolod lived in Constantinople for several years during his childhood.  Another source of inspiration may also have been portable carvings such as [[Barberini ivory|Byzantine ivories]].&lt;ref&gt;Brumfield, W. (1993). A history of Russian architecture. Cambridge ; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, Page 55-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The carvings consist of animals and plants as well as figures in rows and scenes in the ''zakomary''.  Some carvings are also ornamental patterns.  The patterns, plants and animals (both real and imaginary) might be based pagan beliefs and traditions&lt;ref&gt;Kornilovich, K. (1967). Arts of Russia : From the origins to the end of the 16th century. Cleveland: World Pub, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;, traditional Russia folklore&lt;ref&gt;Brumfield, W. (1993). A history of Russian architecture. Cambridge ; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, Page 53&lt;/ref&gt; or Christian theological themes&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, George Heard. The art and architecture of Russia. Penguin Books, 1983, page 77.&lt;/ref&gt;.  These types of carvings make of the majority of the decoration on the cathedral. In each zakomara, there is a figural scene.  The most prominent, on the west façade in the central bay, is a scene featuring King David surrounded by angels and chimeras.  King David is also featured on the south façade central bay surrounded by warrior saints.  Other prominent figures, in addition to Christ and Mary, include Solomon, Alexander the Great, Hercules, warrior saints and churchmen.  The final piece of this theme being the ''zakomara'' of the north façade left showing the donor, Vsevolod with his sons.  In a time when power and territory were taken and held by military might, the building of churches and palaces which support the prince’s authority are important.  This cathedral, not unlike the Cathedral of Dormition by its size and grandeur, by its iconographic program reinforces the prince’s authority by linking it to ancient kings and philosophers, biblical figures and military leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Brumfield, W. (1993). A history of Russian architecture. Cambridge ; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, Page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interior ==
While a few carvings are still intact inside the cathedral, the most important original feature of the interior are a few frescoes above and around the west entrance that have survived since the late 12th century.  The quality of the work varies.  The best work in the faces of saints and angels in the Last Judgement scene are likely the work of Byzantine masters with their Russian pupils completing less important parts such as drapery and background.  The lines and shading of the better parts is comparable to the best work in Greece and Byzantium.  The icon of the Virgin of Vladimir was also known to be in the nearby Cathedral of Dormition at the time the frescoes were painted so was likely a source of inspiration and training.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, Richard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4052">The '''Clark Memorandum on the Monroe Doctrine''' or '''Clark Memorandum''', written on December 17, 1928 by [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s [[United States Deputy Secretary of State|undersecretary of state]] [[J. Reuben Clark]], concerned the [[United States]]' use of [[war|military force]] to intervene in [[Latin America]]n nations. This memorandum was officially released in 1930 by the [[Herbert Hoover]] administration. 

The Clark memorandum rejected the view that the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] was based on the [[Monroe Doctrine]].  However, it was not a complete repudiation of the Roosevelt Corollary but was rather a statement that any intervention by the U.S. was not sanctioned by the Monroe Doctrine but rather was the right of America as a state. This separated the Roosevelt Corollary from the Monroe Doctrine by noting that the Monroe Doctrine only applied to situations involving European countries.  One main point in the Clark Memorandum was to note that the Monroe Doctrine was based on conflicts of interest only between the United States and [[Europe]]an nations, rather than between the United States and Latin American nations.

== Conditions and details ==
During the late 1920s, a number of American foreign policy leaders started to argue for a softer tone in US relations with Latin American nations, which had been chafing under decades of intervention by the United States.  Under secretary of State, and later Ambassador to Mexico, [[J. Reuben Clark]] (1871–1961) held these conciliatory views and completed work on the 236-page Memorandum late in the Coolidge administration. Clark argued the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=5074 |title=Appendix: The Clark Memorandum on the Monroe Doctrine (an extract) |work=Brigham Young University |accessdate=2011-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107052652/http://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=5074 |archivedate=November 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every nation, including the United States, has the right of "self-preservation".
*The principle of self-preservation underlies the Monroe Doctrine.
*The United States alone makes the decision about when to intervene on behalf of Latin American nations.
*The Monroe Doctrine was not concerned with the relationship between the United States and other nations in the Americas, except when European interference in those nations threatened the security of the United States. 
*The Doctrine relates to the relationship of the United States and Latin America on one side versus Europe on the other side, not of the United States on one side versus Latin America on the other side. 
*The primary purpose of the Doctrine was to protect Latin American nations from intervention by European powers, not to victimize or oppress Latin American nations.
*The Roosevelt Corollary was not part of the Monroe Doctrine.
*The application of the Monroe Doctrine by the United States was beneficial to Latin American states.

While sometimes regarded as an outright repudiation of the Roosevelt Corollary, Clark was simply advancing his belief that the corollary was separate from the Monroe Doctrine and that American intervention in Latin America, when necessary, was sanctioned by U.S. rights as a sovereign nation, not by the Monroe Doctrine. 

Clark's views were not made public until March 1930 during the Hoover administration, when Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson was guiding American diplomacy toward the beginning of a [[Good Neighbor Policy]] with its Latin American neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1448.html Clark Memorandum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorandum also used the term "[[national security]]" in its first known usage.

This article is about [[cod]] and other cod-like fishes from the family of [[Gadidae]], such as [[haddock]], [[pollock]] and [[Merlangius merlangus|whiting]], regarded as food.

==Cod==
[[File:Russian Cod liver in an opened can.jpg|thumb|Canned cod liver]]

Cod is popular as a [[food]] with a mild flavour and a dense, flaky [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white flesh]]. Young Atlantic cod or [[haddock]] prepared in strips for cooking is called [[scrod]]. Cod's soft liver can be canned or fermented into [[cod liver oil]], providing an excellent source of [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin D]], [[vitamin E]] and [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s ([[eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Cod flesh is moist and flaky when cooked and is white in colour. In the United Kingdom [[Atlantic cod]] is one of the most common ingredients in [[fish and chips]], along with [[haddock]] and [[plaice]]. Cod can be easily turned into various other products, such as cod liver oil, omega pills, etc.

==Other cod-like fish==

===Haddock===
{{nutritionalvalue | name=Haddock, roast| kJ=469 | protein=24.24 g | fat=0.93 g | carbs=0.0 g | fiber= 0.0 g | | iron_mg=1.35 | calcium_mg=42 | magnesium_mg=50 | phosphorus_mg=241 | potassium_mg=399 | zinc_mg=0.48 | vitC_mg=0.00 | pantothenic_mg=0.150 | vitB6_mg=0.346 | folate_ug=13 | thiamin_mg=0.040 | riboflavin_mg=0.045 | niacin_mg=4.632 | right=1 | source_usda=1 }}

[[Haddock]] is a very popular food fish, sold fresh, [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]], frozen, dried, and, to a small extent, canned. Haddock, along with [[cod]] and [[plaice]], is one of the most popular fish used in British [[fish and chips]].

Fresh haddock has a clean white flesh and can be cooked in the same ways as cod. Freshness of a haddock fillet can be determined by how well it holds together, as a fresh one will be firm; also, fillets should be translucent, while older fillets turn a chalky hue. Young, fresh haddock and cod fillets are often sold as [[scrod]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]; this refers to the size of the fish which have a variety of sizes, i.e. scrod, markets, and cows. Haddock is the predominant fish of choice in Scotland in a [[fish and chips|fish supper]]. It is also the main ingredient of Norwegian fishballs (fiskeboller).

Unlike the related [[cod]], haddock does not [[salting (food)|salt]] well and is often preserved by [[drying (food)|drying]] and [[smoking (cooking)|smoking]].

The smoking of haddock is something that was highly refined in [[Grimsby]]. [[Traditional Grimsby smoked fish]] (mainly haddock, but sometimes cod) is produced in the traditional smoke houses in Grimsby, which are mostly family-run businesses that have developed their skills over many generations.&lt;ref name=gtfs&gt;[http://www.gtfsgroup.co.uk/history.html Grimsby Traditional Fish Smokers Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903070347/http://www.gtfsgroup.co.uk/history.html |date=2010-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grimsby fish market sources its haddock from the North East Atlantic, principally Iceland, Norway and Faroe. These fishing grounds are sustainably managed&lt;ref name=ice&gt;[http://www.ices.dk/committe/acom/comwork/report/2010/Special%20Requests/Icelandic%20cod%20management%20plan.pdf Icelandic Request on the Evaluation of Icelandic Cod and Haddock Management Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206231019/http://www.ices.dk/committe/acom/comwork/report/2010/Special%20Requests/Icelandic%20cod%20management%20plan.pdf |date=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have not seen the large scale depreciation in fish stocks seen in EU waters.&lt;ref name=eu&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Result.do?T1=V5&amp;T2=2008&amp;T3=331&amp;RechType=RECH_naturel&amp;Submit=Search European Commission, Communication on Fishing Opportunities for 2009. May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular form of haddock is [[Finnan haddie]], named for the fishing village of [[Findon, Aberdeenshire|Finnan or Findon]] in Scotland, where it was originally cold-smoked over [[peat]]. Finnan haddie is often served [[poaching (cooking)|poached]] in milk for [[breakfast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&amp;vxChannel=Food%20Recipes&amp;vxClipId=1380_SMG1149&amp;vxBitrate=300 Full recipe for Finnan Haddie from Scottish chef John Quigley]&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Arbroath]] on the east coast of Scotland produces the [[Arbroath Smokie]]. This is a hot-smoked haddock which requires no further cooking before eating.

Smoked haddock naturally has an off-white color; it is very often [[dye]]d yellow, as are other smoked fish. Smoked haddock is the essential ingredient in the Anglo-Indian dish [[kedgeree]].

In 2010, Greenpeace International has added the haddock to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703000000/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=July 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollock===
{{further|Alaska pollock as food}}
[[Atlantic pollock]] is largely considered to be a whitefish, although it is a fairly strongly flavored one. Traditionally a popular source of food in some countries, such as [[Norway]], in the United Kingdom it has previously been largely consumed as a cheaper and versatile alternative to cod and haddock. However, in recent years pollock has become more popular due to over-fishing of cod and haddock. It can now be found in most supermarkets as fresh fillets or prepared freezer items.  For example, it is used minced in [[Fishstick|fish fingers]] or as an ingredient in [[Crab stick|imitation crab meat]].

Because of its slightly gray color, pollock is often prepared, as in Norway, as fried fish balls, or if juvenile sized, breaded with [[oatmeal]] and fried, as in [[Shetland]].  Year-old fish are traditionally split, salted and dried over a peat hearth in [[Orkney]], where their texture becomes wooden and somewhat phosphorescent. The fish can also be salted and smoked and achieve a [[salmon]]-like orange color (although it is not closely related to the salmon), as is the case in [[Germany]] where the fish is commonly sold as ''Seelachs'' or sea salmon. In Korea, pollock may be repeatedly frozen and melted to create ''hwangtae'', half-dried to create ''ko-da-ri'', or fully dried and eaten as ''book-o''.

In 2009, U.K. supermarket [[Sainsbury's]] renamed pollock 'Colin' in a bid to boost ecofriendly sales of the fish as an alternative to cod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/06/sainsburys-pollack-colin-fish-stocks | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Rebecca | last=Smithers | title=A colin and chips? Sainsbury's gives unfashionable pollack a makeover | date=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supermarket also suggested some shoppers may be too embarrassed to ask for the species under its proper title, due to its reputation as an inferior fish, and its similarity to a popular English swear word ([[bollocks]]). Sainsbury's, which said the new name was derived from the French for cooked pollock ([[:fr:Colin#Liste des noms vernaculaires de poissons|''colin'']]), launched the product under the banner "Colin and chips can save British cod."

With the abundance of cod around the coasts of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] it became synonymous with many Newfoundland households as a delicacy to be served as a main meal. [[Dried and salted cod|salt fish]] is soaked in water overnight to reduce the salt content. The hard bread is broken into bite-size pieces, and is also soaked in water overnight. The next day, the fish and hard bread are boiled separately until tender, and then both are served together. The traditional meal is served with ''[[Pork rind|scrunchions]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/dictionary/azindex/pages/3947.html Newfoundland Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603231110/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/dictionary/azindex/pages/3947.html |date=2013-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; salted pork fat which has been cut into small pieces and fried. Both the rendered fat and the liquid fat are then drizzled over the fish and hard bread.

| Similar to a [[croquette]], consisting of a [[filleted fish]] and potato patty sometimes coated in [[breadcrumbs]] or [[Batter (cooking)|batter]], and fried. Salted cod is traditionally used as a filling, though since cod stocks have become depleted other varieties of [[whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]] are used, such as [[haddock]] or [[whiting (fish)|whiting]].&lt;ref name="fishtype"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/842990.stm|title="Has cod had its chips?", BBC News | date=2000-07-20 | accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fishcake has been seen as a way of using up [[leftovers]] that might otherwise be thrown away. In [[Mrs Beeton]]'s 19th century publication ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management|Book of Household Management]]'', her recipe for fishcakes calls for "leftover fish" and "cold [[potato]]es".&lt;ref name="beeton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefoody.com/mrsbfish/fishcake.html|title=Mrs. Beeton's Fish Recipes Revisited, TheFoody.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Corpus Chronicorum Bononiensium''''' is a collection of [[Renaissance]]-era [[chronicle]]s dealing with the history of [[Bologna]].

The collection includes the closely related ''Cronaca Rampona''&lt;ref&gt;*Peter Damian-Grint. "[http://www.encquran.brill.nl/entries/encyclopedia-of-the-medieval-chronicle/cronaca-rampona-SIM_00790 Cronaca Rampona]". Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle. Brill Online, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Cronaca Varignana''. ''Cronaca Rampona'' was formerly misattributed to Ridolfo Ramponi (whence its conventional title). The text of these chronicles mostly consists of the ''Antichità di Bologna'' by the Franciscan friar Bartolomeo della Pugliola (c. 1358–1422/5), which consists of annalistic down to 1420,&lt;ref&gt;{{emc1|Peter Damian-Grint|Bartolomeo della Pugliola|145-146}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in the case of the ''Cronaca Rampona'' was extended in similar style down to the year 1535.

The texts of the collection were edited by [[Albano Sorbelli]] in 1906ff.

'''Diels–Kranz''' ('''DK''') '''numbering''' is the standard system for referencing the works of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, based on the collection of quotations from and reports of their work, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'' ('''''The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), by [[Hermann Alexander Diels]]. The ''Fragmente'' was first published in 1903, was later revised and expanded three times by Diels, and was finally revised in a fifth edition (1934–7) by [[Walther Kranz]] and again in a sixth edition (1952). In Diels-Kranz, each passage, or item, is assigned a number which is used to uniquely identify the ancient personality with which it is concerned, and the type of item given. Diels-Kranz is used in academia to cite pre-Socratic philosophers, and the system also encompasses [[Sophist|Sophists]] and [[Homer|pre-Homeric]] poets such as [[Orpheus]].

[[Stephanus pagination]] is the comparable system for referring to [[Plato]], and [[Bekker numbering]] is the comparable system for referring to [[Aristotle]].

== Background ==
The works of the pre-Socratics have not survived extant to the present day. Our knowledge of them exists only through references in the works of later philosophers (known as [[doxography]]) in the form of quotations and paraphrases. For example, our knowledge of [[Thales of Miletus]] comes largely from the works of Aristotle, who lived centuries after him. Another interesting example of such a source is [[Hippolytus of Rome]], whose polemic ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'' is a source of many direct quotations of [[Heraclitus]] as well as of other philosophers, thereby perpetuating the work of those he was refuting.

These quotations, paraphrases and other references to pre-Socratic philosophers were collected by Diels and Kranz in their book, which became a standard text in modern pre-Socratic education and scholarship. Because of its influence, Diels-Kranz numbering became the standard way of referencing the material: in literature, conferences, and even in conversation.

== Numbering system ==
The number corresponding to an item was made up of three parts:

# a number representing the personality the item is concerned with - this number is also the chapter number in the ''Fragmente''.  For example, "11", also the eleventh chapter of the ''Fragmente'', refers to [[Thales]].
# the letter ''A'', ''B'', or ''C'', corresponding to the type of item given, respectively:
#:A: ''Testimonia'': These are accounts of the authors' life and doctrines. ''Testimonia'' include commentaries on the works of the pre-Socratics and accounts of their lives and of their philosophical views.
#:B: ''Ipsissima Verba'': Literally translated to "exact words", and sometimes also termed "fragments", these are items containing exact words of the author in the form of quotations in later works.
#:C: ''Imitations'': Works which take the author as a model.&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/diels-kr/|title=IEP: "Diels-Kranz Numbering System"|website=www.iep.utm.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# a number representing the position of the particular item in its chapter.  For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why, take the case of Thales, Theodorus. While he was studying the stars and looking upwards, he fell into a pit, and a neat, witty Thracian servant girl jeered at him, they say, because he was so eager to know the things in the sky that he could not see what was there before him at his very feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0172:text=Theaet.:page=174|title=Plato, Theaetetus, page 174|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above text has a DK number of 11A9, since it refers to Thales who is, as mentioned above, chapter 11's subject. The source is ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (one of [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]]), and gives an account of Thales' life, hence it is a ''testimonium'', represented by the letter ''A''. Finally, it is the ninth item in its chapter, giving it the overall number of DK 11A9.

Sometimes, the chapter (personality) number may simply be replaced by the name, which can be helpful in cases where the former is the same as the passage number, to avoid ambiguity.  For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who seek for gold dig up much earth and find a little.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite wikisource|wslink=Fragments_of_Heraclitus#Fragment_22|title=Fragments of Heraclitus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than "22B22" the above may also instead be referred to as "Heraclitus B22" as it is a direct transmission of the words of Heraclitus (thus, B) and is the 22nd item in the chapter about Heraclitus (whose chapter number is also 22) in the ''Fragmente''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/heraclit|title=Heraclitus|website=www.iep.utm.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Table==

The following table gives the Diels-Kranz numbering of Pre-Socratic philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Kathleen |date=1959 |title=The Pre-Socratic Philosophers: A Companion to Diels, ''Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'' (Second Ed.) |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=v-vii }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Kathleen |date=1971 |title=Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers: A complete translation of the Fragments in Diels, ''Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'' |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=vii-ix |quote=1971 Importation, SBN 674-03500-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/app/app01.htm |title=Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers: Contents |website=[[Internet Sacred Text Archive|Sacred Texts]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waterfield |first=Robin |date=2000 |title=The First Philosophers: The Presocratics and the Sophists |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=345-349 |isbn=9780199539093 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Kathleen Freeman (classicist)|Kathleen Freeman]] adopted the fifth edition's numberings for both her ''Companion'' and ''Ancilla'', while also reproducing the fourth edition's numberings in parentheses.  A matching online version of the ''Ancilla's'' table of contents is available at Sacred Texts, for reference.  Later, [[Robin Waterfield]] prepared a new Pre-Socratic reader, which uses an entirely different scheme unrelated to Diels-Kranz.  Nevertheless, Waterfield gives a partial concordance of his own scheme with that of Diels-Kranz, and the partial DK numbering given by Waterfield matches the fifth-edition ''Fragmente'' numbering used by Freeman, so far as it is taken in Waterfield's case.}}  Note that the numbering scheme presented is that of the fifth edition of ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', the first to be revised by Kranz.  The fifth edition's numbering is the scheme which has since gained the most traction in modern Pre-Socratic scholarship, and it is the one used consistently throughout this article.  It should not be confused with the numberings given in other versions, which changed frequently depending on the particular edition of the ''Fragmente''.{{efn|For one example of a variant edition and numbering scheme, see ix-x in the following link.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/diefragmenteder00krangoog |title=Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker |date=1903 |website=[[Internet Archive|archive.org]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most entries (78) are concerned with a single, named individual, while the remaining minority of entries (12) have more complex context.  Of these latter, eight (10, 19, 39, 46, 53-56) are each concerned with groups of named personalties, who typically have a clear relationship of some kind to justify their association in each entry.  Two entries (58, 79) are devoted not to individuals, but to schools of thought (Pythagoreanism and Sophism), and the last two (89, 90) reproduce contemporaneous anonymous texts.  Although "the Seven Sages of Greece" implies a clearly defined set of seven people, historical disagreement renders intractable the problem of exactly who they were, with multiple sources suggesting several different candidates.  If one takes the Seven Sages as a group of seven and includes the later Iamblichus, Diels-Kranz encompasses 106 named personalities and two anonymous authors.  The chapter on Sophism is concerned with the named sophists who take up most of the rest of the scheme, and 
per Freeman with regard to the chapter on Pythagoreanism, a catalogue due to Iamblichus lists 218 named men and 17 named women as Pythagoreans, along with other probable, anonymous adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman's ''Companion'', 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;

In several cases, the personalities listed are so obscure that they are merely mentioned by name in other sources, commonly with hints as to their geographical and philosophical associations, and without even surviving ''paraphrases'' of any of their ideas, or what they might have written.  That is, these more obscure personalities survive in the historical record only as names cited by others, and so came to be included in Diels-Kranz for the sake of scholarly completeness.

The '''Erfurt Program''' was adopted by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] during the SPD congress at [[Erfurt]] in 1891. Formulated under the political guidance of [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[August Bebel]], and [[Karl Kautsky]], it superseded the earlier [[Gotha Program]].

The program declared the imminent death of [[capitalism]] and the necessity of [[socialist]] ownership of the [[means of production]]. The party intended to pursue these goals through legal political participation rather than by revolutionary activity. Kautsky argued that because capitalism, by its very nature, must collapse, the immediate task for [[socialist]]s was to work for the improvement of workers' lives rather than for the [[revolution]], which was inevitable.
==Reception and response==
The draft programme was criticised by [[Friedrich Engels]] for its opportunist, non-Marxist views on the state in a criticism sent by Engels to Kautsky on 29 June 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir I |title=The State and Revolution |year=1917|chapter=4.4 Criticism of the draft of the Erfurt Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kautsky wrote the official SPD commentary on the program in 1892, which was called ''The Class Struggle''. The simplified Marxism exemplified by ''The Class Struggle'' is sometimes referred to as '[[vulgar Marxism]]' or the 'Marxism of the [[Second International]]'{{who|date=February 2014}}. The popular renderings of Marxism found in the works of Kautsky and Bebel were read and distributed more widely in Europe between the late 19th century and 1914 than Marx's own works. ''The Class Struggle'' was translated into 16 languages before 1914 and became the accepted popular summation of Marxist theory. This document came to define [[Orthodox Marxism|'orthodox']] socialist theory before the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 caused a major split in the international socialist movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3069">{{Licensing of patents}}
An '''essential patent''' or '''standard-essential patent''' ('''SEP''') is a [[patent]] that [[claim (patent)|claims]] an invention that must be used to comply with a [[technical standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/shapiro/thicket.pdf Shapiro, Carl, “Navigating the Patent Thicket: Cross Licenses, Patent Pools, and Standard-Setting”, forthcoming Innovation Policy and the Economy, Volume I, MIT Press, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Standards organization]]s, therefore, often require members disclose and grant licenses to their patents and pending patent applications that cover a standard that the organization is developing.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak, ''The Meaning of FRAND, Part I: Royalties'', 9 J. COMPETITION L. &amp; ECON. 931, 949 (2013), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/meaning-of-frand-royalties-for-standard-essential-patents.html."&lt;/ref&gt;

If a standards organization fails to get licenses to all patents that are essential to complying with a standard, owners of the unlicensed patents may demand or sue for royalties from companies that adopt the standard. This happened to the [[GIF]] and [[JPEG]] standards, for example.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Determining which patents are essential to a particular standard can be complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethwoyke/2011/09/21/identifying-the-tech-leaders-in-lte-wireless-patents/ |title=Identifying The Tech Leaders In LTE Wireless Patents |author=Elizabeth Woyke |date=2011-09-21 |work= |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardisation organizations require licences of essential patents to be on [[fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory]] (FRAND) terms.

The '''Haitian Declaration of Independence''' was proclaimed on 1 January 1804 in the port city of [[Gonaïves]] by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], marking the end of 13-year long [[Haitian Revolution]]. The declaration marked Haiti's becoming the first independent nation of [[Latin America]] and only the second in the Americas after the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199210879.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199210879-e-31|title=The Haitian Revolution in Atlantic Perspective|last=Geggus|first=David|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199210879.013.0031|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, the Haitian [[Declaration of independence|Declaration of Independence]] signalled the culmination of the only successful [[Slave rebellion|slave revolution]] in history.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaffield|first=Julia|title=Haiti’s Declaration of Independence: Digging for Lost Documents in the Archives of the Atlantic World|url=http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/1/haitis-declaration-of-independence-digging-for-lost-documents-in-the-archives-of-the-atlantic-world|journal=The Appendix|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two copies of the original printed version exist. Both of these were discovered by Julia Gaffield, a [[Duke University]] postgraduate student, in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (UK)]] in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They are currently held by The National Archives, [[Kew]].

The declaration itself is a three-part document. The longest section, "Le Général en Chef Au Peuple d’Hayti", which is known as the "proclamation," functions as a prologue. It has one signatory, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the senior general and a former slave. Due to Dessalines being illiterate and unable to speak French, his secretary [[Boisrond-Tonnerre|Louis Boisrond-Tonnerre]] then read out the proclamation, followed by the act of independence, which were both written by the latter.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Madiou, Thomas. Histoire D'Haïti. Port Au Prince: Imprimerie De JH Courtois, 1847. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration was later followed by an independence day speech from Dessalines - recited in Haitian Creole - in which he denounced France.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Madiou, Thomas. ''Histoire D'Haïti''. Port Au Prince: Imprimerie De JH Courtois, 1847. 3:146&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the declaration demands vengeance against the French White Creoles, who committed atrocities against the African-Haitian population. Dessalines claimed that:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It is not enough to have expelled the barbarians who have bloodied our land for two centuries; … We must, with one last act of national authority, forever assure the empire of liberty in the country of our birth; we must take any hope of re-enslaving us away from the inhuman government …. In the end we must live independent or die."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://today.duke.edu/showcase/haitideclaration/declarationstext.html|title=Rediscovering Haiti's Declaration of Independence {{!}} The Declaration's Text (in Translation)|website=today.duke.edu|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;''  &lt;/blockquote&gt;These words presaged the [[1804 Haiti massacre]], which was supervised by Dessalines.

Philippe Girard, a [[Guadeloupe]]an academic, has noted that the document is multi-layered with references to six different audiences: "the French, Creoles, Anglo-Americans, Latin Americans, mixed-race Haitians, and black Haitians".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradise Lost: Haiti's Tumultuous Journey from Pearl of the Caribbean to Third World Hotspot|last=Girard|first=Phillipe|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn=140396887X|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Haitian declaration was important because it marked the end of a revolution, not the beginning, unlike most revolutionary struggles prior to the mid-twentieth century. Also, the primary motive behind this revolution was not independence, but rather racial equality and emancipation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although the declaration repeatedly alluded to "freedom from slavery", there was no mention of "republican rights" within the text. As a result, the new nation under Dessalines came to be known as the l’État d’Haïti (The State of Haiti), rather than the Haitian Republic. Following independence, Dessalines accorded all power to himself as the "head of state", which was made possible by the support of the 17 senior officials that signed the third section of the declaration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Social Context ==
{{See also|Haitian Revolution}}

Unlike many other colonial American freedom struggles, the central issue for the Haitian revolution was not independence, but rather freedom from their enslavement under France. In its social and political complexity, the Haitian Revolution resembled the simultaneous revolution in France, since the demand of the revolutionaries was secession from the ruling-class of France.&lt;ref&gt;Akamefula, Tiye, Camille Newsom, Burgey Marcos, and Jong Ho. "Causes of the Haitian Revolution." Haitian Revolution. September 1, 2012. Accessed March 25, 2015. [http://haitianrevolutionfblock.weebly.com/causes-of-the-haitian-revolution.html./ http://haitianrevolutionfblock.weebly.com/causes-of-the-haitian-revolution.html.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, unlike mainland colonies, Haiti was an easily blockaded Caribbean island with a small population, which made independence a less viable option for them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For the black slaves, a revolution and the subsequent declaration of independence was a route to emancipation and racial equality, following the re-establishment of slavery in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte. This decision, in particular, catalyzed the revolution among the slaves who had become more content after the abolition of slavery in 1793. This motive resonated with Dessalines, who was a slave himself. Hence, the eventual declaration in 1804 made several mentions of emancipation and freedom from the "cruelties of the French", rather than a ''de jure'' claim of independence.

A similar attempt to attain independence was carried out on the night of 21 August 1791, when the slaves of Saint Domingue rose in revolt and plunged the colony into civil war. Within the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an unprecedented slave revolt. However, the Legislative Assembly in France granted rights to the free people of colour, in addition to dispatching 6,000 French soldiers to the island.&lt;ref&gt;Blackpast.com [http://www.blackpast.org/?q=gah/haitian-revolution-1791-1804 &lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], Haitian Revolution 1791–1804&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a complete secession from France was not undertaken at the time, and only came into effect after slavery was brought back.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For the white Creole revolutionaries, the declaration of independence connoted to political autonomy. Nevertheless, the ensuing '''[[1804 Haiti massacre]]''' meant that their aims were not fulfilled, and Haiti became the first black sovereign state.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, Robert D. "." 13, no. 5 (2015): 235–50. doi:10.1111/hic3.12233. (2015). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hic3.12233/abstract "Navigating Haiti's History: Saint-Domingue and the Haitian Revolution"]. ''History Compass''. '''13''' (5): 235–50. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.1111/hic3.12233|10.1111/hic3.12233]]&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre—which took place in the entire territory of Haiti—was carried out from early February 1804 until 22 April 1804. During February and March, Dessalines travelled among the cities of Haiti to assure himself that his orders were carried out. This ensured that the social and political power then rested with the blacks and those of mixed-descent, thereby completely changing the status quo post-independence. As such, emancipation gave Dessalines an avenue to exercise revenge on the former slave-owners, who were systematically persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Haitian Revolution#CITEREFGirard2011|Girard 2011]], pp. 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declaring Independence ==
On 1 January 1804, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], the new leader under the dictatorial 1801 constitution, declared Haiti a state in the name of the Haitian people. Dessalines' secretary [[Boisrond-Tonnerre]] stated, "For our declaration of independence, we should have the skin of a white man for parchment, his skull for an inkwell, his blood for ink, and a bayonet for a pen!". Incidentally, it is claimed that Boisrond-Tonnerre was chosen to author the declaration by Dessalines due to this statement itself.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Dessalines assigned all power to himself, by taking the title "governor-general for life," which he replaced nine months later with "emperor".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His establishing of a de facto dictatorship was, in fact, implied within the declaration text as well:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Remember that I sacrificed everything to rally to your defense; family, children, fortune, and now I am rich only with your liberty; my name has become a horror to all those who want slavery. Despots and tyrants curse the day that I was born. If ever you refused or grumbled while receiving those laws that the spirit guarding your fate dictates to me for your own good, you would deserve the fate of an ungrateful people." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Additionally, there is no assertion of 'republican rights', or any 'rights' whatsoever within the declaration. Instead, the idea of independence in this context was restricted to freedom from slavery, not liberalisation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be traced from the 1791 slave rebellion to the 1801 constitution by Loverture, who created an authoritarian society that transferred absolute control from the French to Dessalines. The militaristic rule of Dessalines - with the support of 17 of the 37 senior army officers that denounced France &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; - bore similarity to the [[French Revolution|French Revolution that culminated with the ascent of Napoleon as a dictator in France]].

Furthermore, even though it was successful, Dessalines opted for a revolution only "in one country". This has been linked with the need to assuage his British neighbours' fears of rebellion, due to Britain’s navy controlling the sea-lanes at the time.&lt;ref&gt;David Geggus, "The Influence of the Haitian Revolution on Blacks in Latin America and the Caribbean," in ''Blacks, Coloureds and National Identity in Nineteenth-Century Latin America'', ed. Nancy Naro (London, 2003), 46.13&lt;/ref&gt; In three conciliatory paragraphs that contrast with the strident tone of the rest of the document, Dessalines asks his countrymen to: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy our work; let us allow our neighbours to breathe in peace; may they live quietly under the laws that they have made for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary firebrands, declare ourselves the lawgivers of the Caribbean, nor let our glory consist in troubling the peace of the neighbouring islands. Unlike that which we inhabit, theirs has not been drenched in the innocent blood of its inhabitants; they have no vengeance to claim from the authority that protects them." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Despite this, however, the Haitian Revolution and its consequent independence were unlike other revolutions of the time. The [[History of Haiti|general post-independence autocratic tradition in Haiti]] differentiated it from most other Latin American societies that became republics following a revolution, with the exception of a select few that became monarchies. It was only after the assassination of emperor Dessalines in 1806, that the freed slaves - also signatories of the declaration - went on to establish Haiti's first republic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Act of Independence was supposed to be held at the National Archives building  in Port-au-Prince  and it was there until the government of Fabre Nicolas Geffrard until it was sold to a German who wanted to exhibit in the British Museum.  After the 2010 earthquake, in April 2010, a Canadian graduate student at Duke University was studying in London found the only surviving copy in the British National Archives.

'''Heroes Wiki''' is a [[wiki]]-powered reference site for [[NBC]]'s [[science fiction]] [[drama]] ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''. Launched on October 10, 2006, the site uses [[MediaWiki]] software to maintain a user-created database of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heroeswiki.com/Heroes_Wiki:About |title=About Heroes Wiki |publisher=Heroes Wiki|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heroes Wiki is supported by revenue from advertising, part of which is donated to various charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heroeswiki.com/Heroes_Wiki:Advertising | title=Heroes Wiki Advertising |publisher=Heroes Wiki|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heroeswiki.com/Heroes_Wiki:Revenue |title=Heroes Wiki Revenue |publisher=Heroes Wiki|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 28, 2010, the site contained over 5,500 articles created and edited by approximately 9,400 registered users, with over 157 million page views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heroeswiki.com/Special:Statistics |title=Heroes Wiki MediaWiki statistics page |publisher=Heroes Wiki|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2008, Heroes Wiki announced that it had officially partnered with NBC. NBC now directs those interested in a wiki on ''Heroes'' to Heroes Wiki, and directly funds the site in exchange for on-site advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heroeswiki.com/Heroes_Wiki:Community_Portal#Heroes_Wiki_partnership_with_NBC| title=Heroes Wiki Community Portal |publisher=Heroes Wiki |accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Heroes Wiki was launched on October 10, 2006, several weeks after ''Heroes'' premiered in North America. Content includes articles on episodes, characters, cast and crew, cultural references, along with interviews with members of the ''Heroes'' cast and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heroeswiki.com/Interviews#Heroes_Wiki_Interviews|title=Heroes Wiki Interviews|publisher=Heroes Wiki|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episode [[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]s and user-contributed theories are permitted on certain areas within the wiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://heroeswiki.com/Help:Theories|title=Heroes Wiki Theories Help|publisher=Heroes Wiki|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://heroeswiki.com/Help:Spoilers|title=Heroes Wiki Spoilers Help|publisher=Heroes Wiki|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's main page features upcoming ''Heroes'' events and news, and links to articles summarizing the latest ''Heroes'' episode and online content. There are also links to ''Heroes''-related websites, including official websites affiliated with the show and its producers, websites used in Heroes Evolutions, and unofficial fan sites. On September 18, 2008, the site became [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]-enabled for cell phones and other mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wap.heroeswiki.com|title=wap.heroeswiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has also established nine projects containing translations of the main English language version of the wiki: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heroeswiki.com/Heroes_Wiki:Languages| title=Heroes Wiki Languages |publisher=Heroes Wiki |accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Heroes Wiki began its partnership with NBC in October 2008, links were added pointing to Heroes Wiki on NBC's ''Heroes'' and ''Heroes Evolutions'' sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/news/2008/10/20/heroes-wiki/|title=NBC Heroes News - HEROES WIKI|publisher=NBC|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC also discontinued promoting its own wiki for ''Heroes'', instead redirecting readers to Heroes Wiki through links at the top of related pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9thwonders.com|title=9th Wonders! ''Heroes'' forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, the wiki was also referenced in several segments of NBC's ''Heroes'' Insider Interactive SMS, which uses text messaging to send facts, pose trivia questions, and conduct polling during the airing of episodes of the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/sprint/isms/ Heroes Insider Interactive SMS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730012436/http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/2screen/intro.shtml |date=2008-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://heroeswiki.com/Heroes_Interactive:The_Eclipse,_Part_2|title=Heroes Interactive:The Eclipse, Part 2|publisher=Heroes Wiki|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in ''Heroes Evolutions''==
As part of the [[alternate reality game]] in ''[[Heroes Evolutions]]'', a mysterious ''Heroes'' character known only as [[HeroesWiki:Evs Dropper|Evs Dropper]] answered a number of fan-submitted questions posed by e-mail by Heroes Wiki administrator [[HeroesWiki:Ryan Gibson Stewart|Ryan Gibson Stewart]]. The interview was posted at Heroes Wiki on July 24, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heroeswiki.com/Interview:Evsdropr |title=Heroes Wiki Interview with Evs Dropper |publisher=Heroes Wiki |accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

The '''''Huanglan''''' or '''''Imperial Mirror''''' was the oldest [[Chinese encyclopedia]] or ''[[leishu]]'' "classified dictionary". [[Cao Pi]], the first emperor of the [[Cao Wei|Wei]], ordered its compilation upon his accession to the throne in 220 and it was completed in 222. The purpose of the ''Huanglan'' was to provide the emperor and ministers of state with conveniently arranged summaries of all that was known at the time. Complete versions of the ''Huanglan'' existed until the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279), when it became a [[lost work]], although some quotations did survive in other encyclopedias and anthologies. The ''Huanglan'' was the prototype of the classified encyclopedia and served as a model for later ones such as the (624) Tang ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' and the (1408) Ming ''[[Yongle dadian]].

==Title==
The title combines ''huáng'' [[wikt:皇|皇]] "emperor; imperial" and ''lǎn'' [[wikt:覽|覽]] "see; look at; watch; inspect; display" (compare the ''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' encyclopedia). This character 覽 redundantly combines ''jiàn'' 見 "‘see" and the phonetic element ''jiān'' 監 &lt; [[Old Chinese]] *''kˁram'' "see; look at; inspect", which was an ancient graphic [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] for ''jiàn'' &lt; *''kˁram-s'' 鑑 or 鑒 "mirror", [[cognate]] with ''jìng'' 鏡 *''qraŋ-s'' "mirror".

Five centuries before the title ''Huanglan'' first occurred, but the words ''huang'' (before it meant "emperor") and ''lan'' co-occur in the ''[[Chuci]]'' poem [[Li Sao]] "Encountering Sorrow", believed to be written by [[Qu Yuan]] (c. 340-278 BCE). The 1st line establishes the poet's noble ancestry from [[Zhuanxu]], the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]]'s grandson, the 2nd describes his auspicious birth, and the 3rd line says, "My father, seeing the aspect of my nativity (皇覽揆余初度兮), Took omens to give me an auspicious name" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 68). In this context, ''huang'' 皇 means "august; stately; revered" in reference to the poet's father and ''lan'' 覽 means "see".

The "[[mirror]]" meaning of the Chinese ''lan'' in ''Huanglan'' parallels the Medieval genre of [[speculum literature]] that aimed to encompass encyclopedic knowledge in a single work (e.g., [[Albertus Magnus]]'s ''[[Speculum astronomiae]]''), and the modern scholarly [[survey article]] that summarizes a field of knowledge.

Although the title is usually [[transliterate]]d ''Huanglan'' or ''Huang Lan'', some English translations are:
*''Imperial Speculum'' (Needham et al. 1986: 569)
*''The Imperial Survey'' (Yong and Peng 2008: 225)
*''Book for the Emperors'' (Cheng, Brown, et al. 2009 5: 2667)
*''Emperor's mirror'' (Zurndorfer 2013: 505)
*''Imperial Anthology'' (''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 2015)

==History==
[[File:Cao Pi Tang.jpg|thumb|A painting of Cao Pi and two ministers, by the [[Tang dynasty]] artist [[Yan Liben]].]]
Beginning with the 3rd-century ''Huanglan'', the first Chinese "encyclopedia" genre was the "imperial [[florilegium]]" that compiled excerpts from other writings and arranged them under appropriate headings for the convenience of the emperor and his ministers (Needham et al. 1986: 200). Chinese traditional ''leishu'' encyclopedias differ from Western [[encyclopedias]] in that they consist almost entirely of selected quotations from written sources and arranged by a set of categories, the name encyclopedia having been applied to them because they embrace the whole realm of knowledge (Teng and Biggerstaff 1971: 81).

The emperor summoned a group of Confucian scholars to compile a completely new type of [[reference work]] that would provide the emperor and his ministers with a quick source for finding moral and political precedents (Zurndorfer 2013: 505). The chief editor Mou Xi 繆襲 (186-245) collaborated with [[Liu Shao (Three Kingdoms)|Liu Shao]], [[Huan Fan]], Wang Xiang 王象, Wei Dan 韋誕, and other scholars (Needham et al. 1986: 569, Theobald 2013).

Cao Pi instructed his officials to collect all the available classical philosophical texts and their commentaries, and to arrange them in ''suilei xiangcong'' 隨類相從 "successive categories" (Zurndorfer 2013: 509). The ''Huanglan'' compilers adopted the macrostructure of the (c. 3rd century BCE) ''[[Erya]]'' dictionary with explicitly labelled sections, the microstructure of the (c. 239 BCE) ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'' (Yong and Peng 2008: 225). The original ''Huanglan'' was divided into over 40 sections and comprised over 1000 chapters.

During the [[Six dynasties]] period (222-589), a number of works like the ''Huanglan'' were compiled, including the (c. 530) [[Liang dynasty]] ''Hualin bianlue'' 華林遍略 "An Arrangement of the Whole Company of Flowers" by Xu Mian 徐勉 and (c. 550) [[Northern Qi]] ''Xiuwendian yulan'' 修文殿御覽 "Imperial Speculum of the Hall of the Cultivation of Literature" (tr. Needham et al. 1986: 207, 571). Both of these were lost. Between the 3rd and 18th centuries, some 600 ''leishu'' were compiled, of which only 200 are still extant (Zurndorfer 2013: 505).

The textual history of the ''Huanglan'' is recorded in the bibliography sections of the standard ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]''. The (636) ''[[Book of Sui]]'' bibliography [[:zh:s:隋書/卷34|經籍志]] section records ''Huanglan'' 皇覽 editions in a 120-chapter version edited by Moui Xi 繆襲 and others, a [[Liang dynasty]] 680-chapter version, a 123-chapter version by the astronomer He Chengtian 何承天, and a 50-chapter version by Xu Yuan 徐爰. It also records the lost 4-chapter ''Huanglanmu'' 皇覽目 index, and the 12-chapter ''Huanglan chao'' 皇覽抄 revised by Prince Xiao Chen 蕭琛. The (945) ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' bibliography [[:zh:s:舊唐書/卷47|經籍下]] records a 122-chapter version by He Chengtian, and an 84-chapter one by Xu Yuan. Subsequent standard histories do not record the ''Huanglan''. By the year 1000, the complete version ''Huanglan'' was definitively known to be lost (Drege 1991: 24).

Several [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911) scholars collected surviving fragments of the lost encyclopedia (e.g., the ''[[Commentary on the Water Classic]]'' quotes it 15 times). For example, Huang Shi 黃奭's ''Wei Huanglan'' 魏皇覽 and [[Wang Mo]]'s ''Huanglan yili'' 皇覽逸禮.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1204">'''Hunaland''' and its people are mentioned several times in the [[Poetic Edda]], and in the [[Fornaldarsaga]]s. 

Its origins are partly the old [[Frankish Empire|Frank]]ish kingdom (the [[Franks]] were once called ''Hugones'', in [[Latin]], and ''Hūgas'' in [[Old English language|Old English]]) and partly in the [[Huns]].

The Frankish hero [[Sigurd]] is called the ''Hunnish king'' in epic poetry.

Also the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' and the ''[[Þiðrekssaga|Vilkina saga]]'' mention Hunaland, its kings and its hosts.

In [[Old Norse]] sources, Hunaland often has a mythological character and can shift between different parts of Europe, depending on what kind of skills the hero is to show. It is separated from other countries by the forest [[Myrkviðr]], but one source may locate it up in the north at [[Bjarmaland]], another source says that it borders on [[Reidgotaland]], a third source places it in parts of [[Germany]] and other sources place it on either side of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] down to [[Gästrikland]], in Sweden.

'''James Britten''' (3 May 1846 – 8 October 1924) was an English [[Botany|botanist]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Chelsea, London]], he moved to [[High Wycombe]] in 1865 to begin a medical career. However he became increasingly interested in botany, and began writing papers on the subject. His first publication was probably that published in the ''[[Journal of Botany, British and Foreign|Journal of Botany]]'' in 1863.

In 1869, he was appointed a junior assistant at the Herbarium at the  [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]. In 1871, he joined the Department of Botany at the [[British Museum]] and remained in this position until his retirement in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meiosis.org.uk/botanists/britten-james-1846-1924/|title=Britten, James (1846 – 1924) {{!}} meiosis.org.uk|website=www.meiosis.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, he succeeded Henry Trimen as editor of the ''[[Journal of Botany, British and Foreign]]''. He would hold the editorship for around 45 years. Botanist [[Norman Hall (botanist)|Norman Hall]] wrote of Britten: "Britten threw himself fully into the editorship, although his pungent remarks on papers submitted were not always appreciated."&lt;ref name="Hall 1978"&gt;{{cite book |first=Norman |last=Hall |year=1978 |title=Botanists of the Eucalypts |location=Australia |publisher=[[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization]] |isbn=0643002715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britten was also heavily involved in the [[Catholic Truth Society]]. This had lapsed in 1872, but Britten helped revive it in 1884, and dominated the movement for many years.&lt;ref name="CTS"&gt;{{cite web|title=CTS History |url=http://www.cts-online.org.uk/CTS_history.htm |accessdate=2007-04-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406111552/http://www.cts-online.org.uk/CTS_history.htm |archivedate= 6 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, during his time as secretary of the Society, they published ''Protestant Fiction''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/protestantfictio00brituoft Protestant fiction]&lt;/ref&gt;

This earned him an appointment as Knight and later Knight Commander of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]].&lt;ref name="Hall 1978"/&gt; He died at age 79.

==Biography==
Arthur was born in 1887. He married Katherine Arthur (1883–1960) and had the following children: Margaret Jean Arthur (1913- ), James Osborne Arthur, Jr. (1915–2002), John Paul Arthur (1917–1987), Robert Lee Arthur (1919–2000) and Kathryn Arthur (1923- ).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/sets/72157622698597143/ |title=Reverend James Osborne Arthur collection, 1913-1928  |accessdate=2009-11-17 |quote=The Arthurs had five children who are were also documented in the this [sic] collection: Margaret Jean (1913-), James, Jr. (1915-2002), John Paul (1917-1987), Robert Lee (1919-2000) and Kathryn (1923-). |publisher=[[National Museum of the American Indian]] at [[Flickr]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was at the [[Winnebago Reservation]] in [[Nebraska]] in 1913 and among the [[Chiricahua]] and [[Mescalero Apaches]] in the Whitetail section of the [[Mescalero Apache Reservation]] in [[New Mexico]] from 1914 to 1919.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10333">'''Lance Williams''' and '''[[Mark Fainaru-Wada]]''' co-authored the book ''[[Game of Shadows]]'' while they were reporters for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.  For their investigative work in the field of steroids, Williams and Fainaru-Wada were given the 2004 [[George Polk Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklyn.liu.edu/polk/press/2005.html|title=George Polk Awards for Journalism press release|accessdate=November 22, 2006 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Long Island University |pages= |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of their investigative research, Williams and Fainaru-Wada were the first to report that:
*track star [[Marion Jones]] purportedly received illegal drugs from the steroid supplier [[BALCO]]
*world record-holder [[Tim Montgomery]] testified before a federal grand jury that he had used steroids
*baseball slugger [[Jason Giambi]] testified that he had used steroids

On May 5, 2006, Fainaru-Wada and Williams were subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury about how they obtained leaked grand jury testimony. On May 31, the authors urged [[United States]] District Judge [[Martin Jenkins]] of [[San Francisco]] to excuse them from testifying. This appeal was supported by [[affidavit]]s from ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporters [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Mark Corallo]], a former press secretary to former [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]], but was denied on August 15, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2550685 "Judge: Reporters must reveal sources in Bonds case"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sept 21, 2006, the journalists were sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court. The two have repeatedly stated that they would go to prison before revealing their sources. The two avoided jail time, however, when attorney Troy Ellerman pleaded guilty on Feb. 14, 2007, to leaking the information, lying to prosecutors, obstructing justice and disobeying a court order not to disclose grand jury information. The two reporters were awarded the 2007 [[Dick Schaap Award for Outstanding Journalism]].

Fainaru-Wada left the ''Chronicle'' in November 2007 to join [[ESPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6501141.html|title=ESPN Beefs Up Steroid Expertise|accessdate=December 7, 2007 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Broadcasting and Cable |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116153314/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6501141.html|dead-url=yes|archivedate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Williams left the ''Chronicle'' for [[California Watch]], a new West Coast division of the [[Center for Investigative Reporting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003999179 Joe Strupp, "Lance Williams to Write for CIR", ''Editor and Publisher'' (July 31, 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802195208/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003999179 |date=August 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand jury subpoena==
===Forced to testify===
On August 15, 2006, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White ordered Fainaru-Wada and Williams to comply with their subpoenas and testify, saying that, if they do not, they will be held in contempt and incarcerated until such time as they decide to talk or if the grand jury expires and has to be thrown out. They may also be freed from this obligation if a higher court reverses the ruling. The reporters have previously stated that they would rather go to jail than testify.

===Controversy===
Following Judge White's decision to uphold the [[subpoena]], public controversy stirred concerning whether or not the two reporters should be forced to reveal their sources. While many contend that confidential sources have been utilized by the press since the beginning of its existence, others believe that by not revealing their confidential sources, Fainaru-Wada and Williams are, in effect, [[Obstruction of justice|obstructing justice]] and should be punished accordingly.

Those who believe that confidential sources are necessary in reporting often point to the work of [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and their mysterious source, "[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]," to whom they refer several times in their articles detailing the [[Watergate scandal]].

In an [[affidavit]], California Attorney General [[Bill Lockyer]] stated that, "To jail a journalist because he protected his source is an assault not only on the press, but on Californians as well."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/20/EDG0SJ799P1.DTL&amp;hw=Mark+Fainaru+Wada&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 Justice Department on steroids] August 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eve Burton]], who has been the [[Hearst Corporation]] lawyer for the two reporters, said, "I think that they [Fainaru-Wada and Williams] have the constitutional right to protect their sources. I think law-enforcement's interest in determining who leaked the information to the press has to be balanced against the significant public-reporting that these guys did. Without the laws that have protected journalists for the past thirty years," she contended, "We wouldn't have had [[Watergate]], we wouldn't have had [[BALCO]], and we won't have the next government corruption case that comes along. That's the importance to the public in this. The reporters [must] be able to provide public information, and without the use of confidential sources -- carefully conceived, properly used -- we will not learn about important matters that involve our government."

Lance Williams also expressed a similar concern, saying, "As far as the government coming after us, the world has changed since this story was published. In [the days of Woodward and Bernstein], the government was not going around the country subpoenaing reporters. This is a very new development. It's really an innovation of the current [[Attorney General]], as far as I can tell. But the number of reporters subpoenaed in the past decade is not very great. And the number subpoenaed recently is a large proportion of the number subpoenaed in the past 20 to 25 years. We didn't know we were risking jail, we thought [the government] would try to find out the sources, but we really did not anticipate that it would get to this point. Because as a matter of practice, that wasn't what they were doing in those days."&lt;ref name="bent" /&gt;

On Jan. 18, 2007, [[John Conyers]] and [[Thomas M. Davis|Tom Davis]] sent [[Alberto Gonzales]] a letter asking him to withdraw the subpoenas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/16491753.htm BALCO journalists find ally in Conyers] Jan. 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government motivation==
On August 21, 2006, in an interview with [[Forrest Wilkinson]] of [[RealGM]], Lance Williams was quoted as saying, "We always thought there was a disconnect between the government's interest in steroid use. There's no question that the people who put the case [against BALCO] together bent over backwards to protect the users of the drugs, first they condoned their use of illegal drugs, then they excised all of their names from the court filings. It goes on to this day -- this attempt to protect these wealthy athletes."

Fainaru-Wada also questioned the government's motives, "You have these high-profile athletes, multi-million dollar athletes in some cases, who were the users of the drugs and, wanting to clean up sports," he contended, "[Congress] probably [should] expose those people, and yet, all those athletes are protected and their names were hidden from public file, or retracted by using generic names such as 'A Major League Baseball player', 'an NFL player', those types of things."&lt;ref name="bent"&gt;[http://www.realgmbaseball.com/src_wiretap_archives/3413/20060821/the_motives_behind_publishing_grand_jury_testimony/ Lance Williams: 'Government Bent Over Backwards To Protect Drug Users'] 22nd August, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Profit from book===
After having published ''[[Game of Shadows]]'', it has become a topic for debate as to whether it should be acceptable to profit from material illegally disclosed to them. Both Fainaru-Wada and Williams claim that they have received little-to-no profit from their book, to this point.  "We haven't seen anything from royalties yet. All I can say is, we're not getting rich, we're not retiring, we're not buying new houses, we're not buying mansions or anything like that. I'm not going to change my status (Laughs). And I would just say, even if it did, it's not relevant. I didn't do this for the money, Lance didn't do this for the money; we did this because we love reporting, because this is a great story, and because it's an important one, and that's why we did it," Fainaru-Wada said in the [[RealGM]] article. He also remarked, "Lance has a 'semi-joke' that, he did the math, and he makes, in a year, as a reporter for the Chronicle, what [Barry] Bonds makes in three innings." Williams went even further, saying that they had actually received an advance-payment so that they could afford to take time off work to write ''[[Game of Shadows]]''.&lt;ref name="bent" /&gt;

A '''library classification''' is a [[system]] of [[knowledge organization]] by which library resources are arranged and ordered. Library classifications use a notational system that represents the order of topics in the classification and allows items to be stored in that order. Library classification systems group related materials together, typically arranged in a hierarchical tree structure. A different kind of classification system, called a [[faceted classification]] system, is also widely used which allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, enabling the classifications to be ordered in multiple ways. The library classification numbers can be considered identifiers for resources but are distinct from the [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN) or [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN) system.

== Description ==
Library classification is an aspect of [[library and information science]]. It is distinct from [[taxonomy (general)|scientific classification]] in that it has as its goal to provide a useful ordering of documents rather than a theoretical organization of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Library classification is distinct from the application of [[Index term|subject headings]] in that classification organizes knowledge into a systematic order, while subject headings provide access to intellectual materials through vocabulary terms that may or may not be organized as a knowledge system.&lt;ref name=chan &gt;{{Citation

The characteristics that a bibliographic classification demands for the sake of reaching these purposes are: a useful sequence of subjects at all levels, a concise memorable notation, and a host of techniques and devices of number synthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Satija|first1=M P|title=Features, Functions and Components of a Library Classification System in the LIS tradition for the e-Environment|journal=Information Science Theory and Practice|date=2015|issue=3(4)|pages=62–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Library classifications were preceded by classifications used by bibliographers such as [[Conrad Gessner]]. The earliest library classification schemes organized books in broad subject categories. The earliest known library classification scheme is the [[Pinakes]] by [[Callimachus]], a scholar at the [[Library of Alexandria]] during the Third Century BCE.  During the Renaissance and Reformation era, "Libraries were organized according to the whims or knowledge of individuals in charge." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277203534|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=1948-|first=Murray, Stuart,|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Pub.|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|oclc=277203534}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This changed the format in which various materials were classified.  Some collections were classified by language and others by how they were printed. 

After the [[Printing_press#The_Printing_Revolution|printing revolution]] in the sixteenth century, the increase in available printed materials made such broad classification unworkable, and more granular classifications for library materials had to be developed in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=shera&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shera|first1=Jesse H|title=Libraries and the organization of knowledge|date=1965|publisher=Archon Books|location=Hamden, Conn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although libraries created order within their collections from as early as the fifth century B.C.,&lt;ref name=shera /&gt; the Paris Bookseller's classification, developed in 1842 by [[Jacques Charles Brunet]], is generally seen as the first of the modern book classifications. Brunet provided five major classes: theology, jurisprudence, sciences and arts, belles-lettres, and history.&lt;ref name=sayers&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sayers|first1=Berwick|title=An introduction to library classification|date=1918|publisher=H. W. Wilson|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are many standard systems of library classification in use, and many more have been proposed over the years. However, in general, classification systems can be divided into three types depending on how they are used:

* '''Universal schemes''' which cover all subjects, for example the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], [[Universal Decimal Classification]] and [[Library of Congress Classification]]
* '''Specific classification schemes''' which cover particular subjects or types of materials, for example [[Iconclass]], [[British Catalogue of Music Classification]], and [[Dickinson classification]], or the [[NLM Classification]] for medicine. 
* '''National schemes''' which are specially created for certain countries, for example the [[Sweden|Swedish]] library classification system, SAB (Sveriges Allmänna Biblioteksförening).

In terms of functionality, classification systems are often described as:

*'''[[Enumeration|enumerative]]''': subject headings are listed alphabetically, with numbers assigned to each heading in alphabetical order.
*'''[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]''': subjects are divided hierarchically, from most general to most specific.
*'''[[Faceted classification|faceted]]''' or '''analytico-synthetic''': subjects are divided into mutually exclusive orthogonal facets.

There are few completely enumerative systems or faceted systems; most systems are a blend but favouring one type or the other. The most common classification systems, LCC and DDC, are essentially enumerative, though with some hierarchical and faceted elements (more so for DDC), especially at the broadest and most general level. The first true faceted system was the [[Colon classification]] of [[S. R. Ranganathan]].

==Methods or systems==

Classification types denote the classification or categorization according to the form or characteristics or qualities of a classification scheme or schemes. Method and system has similar meaning. Method or methods or system means the classification schemes like Dewey Decimal Classification or Universal Decimal Classification. The types of classification is for identifying and understanding or education or research purposes while classification method means those classification schemes like DDC, UDC.
 
===English language universal classification systems===
The most common systems in [[English language|English]]-speaking countries are:
* [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC)
* [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC)
* [[Colon classification]] (CC)
* [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC)

Other systems include:
* [[Harvard-Yenching Classification]], an English classification system for Chinese language materials.
* V-LIB 1.2 (2008 Vartavan Library Classification for over 700 fields of knowledge, currently sold under license in the UK by Rosecastle Ltd. (see http://rosecastle.atspace.com/index_files/VartavanLibrary.htm)).

===Non-English universal classification systems===
* A system of book classification for Chinese libraries (Liu's Classification) library classification for user
** [[New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries]]
* [[Nippon Decimal Classification]] (NDC)
* [[Chinese Library Classification]] (CLC)
* [[Korean Decimal Classification]] (KDC)
* Russian [[:ru:Библиотечно-библиографическая классификация|Library-Bibliographical Classification]] (BBK)

===Universal classification systems that rely on synthesis (faceted systems)===
* [[Bliss bibliographic classification]]
* [[Colon classification]]
* [[Cutter Expansive Classification]]
* [[Universal Decimal Classification]]

Newer classification systems tend to use the principle of synthesis (combining codes from different lists to represent the different attributes of a work) heavily, which is comparatively lacking in LC or DDC.

==The practice of classifying==

Library classification is associated with library (descriptive) cataloging under the rubric of ''cataloging and classification'', sometimes grouped together as ''technical services''. The library professional who engages in the process of cataloging and classifying library materials is called a ''cataloger'' or ''catalog librarian''. Library classification systems are one of the two tools used to facilitate [[subject access]].  The other consists of alphabetical indexing languages such as Thesauri and Subject Headings systems.

Library classification of a piece of work consists of two steps. Firstly, the "aboutness" of the material is ascertained. Next, a call number (essentially a book's address) based on the classification system in use at the particular library will be assigned to the work using the notation of the system.

It is important to note that unlike subject heading or thesauri where multiple terms can be assigned to the same work, in library classification systems, each work can only be placed in one class. This is due to shelving purposes: A book can have only one physical place. However, in classified catalogs one may have main entries as well as added entries. Most classification systems like the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC) and [[Library of Congress Classification]] also add a [[cutter number]] to each work which adds a code for the author of the work.

Classification systems in libraries generally play two roles. Firstly, they facilitate [[subject access]] by allowing the user to find out what works or documents the library has on a certain subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iva.dk/bh/lifeboat_ko/concepts/subject_access_points.htm|title=Subject access points|work=iva.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, they provide a known location for the information source to be located (e.g. where it is shelved).

Until the 19th century, most libraries had closed stacks, so the library classification only served to organize the subject [[library catalog|catalog]]. In the 20th century, libraries opened their stacks to the public and started to shelve library material itself according to some library classification to simplify subject browsing.

Some classification systems are more suitable for aiding subject access, rather than for shelf location. For example, [[Universal Decimal Classification]], which uses a complicated notation of pluses and colons, is more difficult to use for the purpose of shelf arrangement but is more expressive compared to DDC in terms of showing relationships between subjects. Similarly [[faceted classification]] schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement, unless the user has knowledge of the citation order.

Depending on the size of the library collection, some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other. In extreme cases, a public library with a small collection might just use a classification system for location of resources but might not use a complicated subject classification system. Instead all resources might just be put into a couple of wide classes (travel, crime, magazines etc.). This is known as a "mark and park" classification method, more formally called reader interest classification.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Sarah N., and Eugene Mulero. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/14/us/14dewey.html "Dewey? At This Library With a Very Different Outlook, They Don't"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparing classification systems ==
As a result of differences in notation, history, use of enumeration, hierarchy, and facets, classification systems can differ in the following ways:
* Type of Notation: Notation can be pure (consisting of only numerals, for example) or mixed (consisting of letters and numerals, or letters, numerals, and other symbols). 
* Expressiveness: This is the degree to which the notation can express relationship between concepts or structure.
* Whether they support mnemonics: For example, the number 44 in DDC notation often means it concerns some aspect of France. For example, in the Dewey classification 598.0944 concerns "Birds in France", the 09 signifies geographical division, and 44 represents France.
* Hospitality: The degree to which the system is able to accommodate new subjects.
* Brevity: The length of the notation to express the same concept.
* Speed of updates and degree of support: The better classification systems are frequently being reviewed.
* Consistency 
* Simplicity
* Usability

The '''Malayan Declaration of Independence''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Pemasyhuran Kemerdekaan Tanah Melayu'' [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: ڤمشهوران كمرديكاءن تانه ملايو), was officially proclaimed on 31 August 1957, by [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], the first Chief Minister of the [[Federation of Malaya]]. In a ceremony held at the [[Merdeka Stadium]], the proclamation document was read out at exactly 0930 a.m in the presence of thousands of Malayan citizens, [[Malay Rulers]] and foreign dignitaries. The proclamation acknowledges the establishment of an independent and democratic [[Federation of Malaya]], which came into effect on the termination of the [[British protectorate]] over nine [[Malay states]] and the end of British colonial rule in two [[Straits Settlements]], [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]].

The document of the declaration was signed by [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], who was appointed as the nation's first [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]]. The event is celebrated annually in Malaysia with national day ''[[Hari Merdeka]]''.

==Date of Independence==
The date for Federation of Malaya's Independence on 31 August 1957 was determined after Tunku Abdul Rahman, Haji Sulaiman Palestin, Haji Ahmad Badawi, and a number of other [[United Malays National Organization|UMNO]] leaders sought the views of [[Syeikh Abdullah Fahim]], a notable ''[[Ulama]]'' from [[Kepala Batas, Penang]]. According to Syeikh Abdullah Fahim, if the British would not grant independence to Malaya on 31 August 1957, the next fitting date should be 31 August 1962. The Saturday 31 August 1957 was referred by Syeikh Abdullah Fahim as ''am khair atana'' (عام خير اتانا) in Arabic which means 'Good Year Has Come to Us'. It was confirmed in a February 1956 Alliance rally in Melaka after the Tunku had just arrived from the United Kingdom.

==Declaration ceremony==
On the night of 30 August 1957, crowds gathered at the [[Royal Selangor Club]] [[Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur|Padang]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]] to witness the handover of power from the British. Prime Minister-designate [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] arrived at 11:58&amp;nbsp;p.m. and joined members of the [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance Party]]'s youth divisions in observing two minutes of darkness.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |title=1957: Malaya celebrates independence |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/31/newsid_3534000/3534340.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=24 April 2011 |date=31 August 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the stroke of midnight, the lights were switched back on, and the [[Union Flag]] in the square was lowered.&lt;ref name="night"&gt;{{cite web|title=Detik Jam Tengah Malam Di Padang Kelab Selangor |url=http://www.arkib.gov.my/padang_kelab_selangor |language=Malay |publisher=National Archive of Malaysia |accessdate=24 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007210716/http://www.arkib.gov.my/padang_kelab_selangor |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Flag of Malaya]] was raised as the national anthem ''[[Negaraku]]'' was played. This was followed by seven chants of "Merdeka" by the crowd.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="night"/&gt; Tunku Abdul Rahman later gave a speech hailing the ceremony as "greatest moment in the life of the Malayan people".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Before giving the address to the crowd, he was given a necklace by representatives of the Alliance Party youth in honour of this great occasion in history, with a map of Malaya inscribed on it. The event ended at one in the morning the next day.

On the morning of 31 August 1957, the festivities moved to the newly completed [[Merdeka Stadium]]. More than 20,000 people witnessed the ceremony, which began at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Those in attendance included rulers of the Malay states, foreign dignitaries, members of the federal cabinet, and citizens.&lt;ref name="declaration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pengisytiharan Kemerdekaan Tanah Melayu |url=http://www.arkib.gov.my/pengisytiharan_kemerdekaan_tanah_melayu |language=Malay |publisher=National Archives of Malaysia |accessdate=24 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007210758/http://www.arkib.gov.my/pengisytiharan_kemerdekaan_tanah_melayu |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]]'s representative, the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] presented Tunku Abdul Rahman with the instrument of independence.&lt;ref name="declaration"/&gt; Tunku then proceeded to read the declaration, which culminated in the chanting of "Merdeka!" seven times with the crowd joining in. The ceremony continued with the raising of the National Flag of Malaya accompanied by the national anthem being played by a [[military band]] and a [[21-gun salute]], followed by an ''[[Adhan|azan]]'' call and a thanksgiving prayer in honour of this great occasion.&lt;ref name="declaration"/&gt;

The day followed with the solemn installation of the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku [[Abdul Rahman of Negeri Sembilan]], at Jalan Ampang, and the first installation banquet in his honour in the evening followed by a beating retreat performance and a fireworks display. Sports events and other events marked the birth of the new nation.

The '''OpenStreetMap Foundation''' is a [[company limited by guarantee]], registered in England and Wales on 22 August 2006.&lt;ref name=companieshouse /&gt;

It is a [[Foundation (non-profit)|non-profit foundation]] whose aim is to support and enable the development of freely-reusable geospatial data. As its name suggests, it is closely connected with the [[OpenStreetMap]] project, although its constitution does not prevent it supporting other projects.

== Structure ==
OSMF is a [[membership organisation]], with all members entitled to vote at a general meeting on foundation activities. OSMF members do not determine how OpenStreetMap itself operates, only the foundation.{{clarify|reason=It can be interpreted in two opposite meanings.|date=June 2018}} Membership is open to all on payment of the membership fee of £15 per year. {{Asof|2015|12}}, there were 701 members.&lt;ref name=membership /&gt;

The foundation is funded by a combination of membership fees and specific larger donations. Notably [[MapQuest]] donated $50,000 to the foundation in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coast|first=Hurricane|title=Donation to OSMF by MapQuest/AOL|url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2011/01/26/donation-to-osmf-by-mapquestaol/|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Esri]] donated an undisclosed amount in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donation from Esri|url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/03/19/esri-donation/|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2013, the foundation accepted corporate memberships in a "associated member" (non-voting) category. Founding corporate members are Geofabrik, [[Geotab]], [[Naver]], NextGIS and [[Mapbox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Corporate Members|url=http://www.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Corporate_Members|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation is run by a board of seven members, including the foundation's officers: chairman, secretary and treasurer.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

In December 2015, the current board was announced:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officers &amp; Board|url=https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Officers_%26_Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar|Manifestations}}

'''Persecution''' is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group by another individual or group. The most common forms are [[religious persecution]], [[racism]] and [[political persecution]], though there is naturally some overlap between these terms. The inflicting of suffering, [[harassment]], [[imprisonment]], [[internment]], fear, or pain are all factors that may establish persecution, but not all suffering will necessarily establish persecution. The suffering experienced by the victim must be sufficiently severe. The threshold level of severity has been a source of much debate.&lt;ref&gt;S. Rempell, Defining Persecution, http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941006&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
As part of the [[Nuremberg Principles]], [[crimes against humanity]] are part of international law. Principle VI of the [[Nuremberg Principles]] states that
{{quotation|The crimes hereinafter set out are punishable as crimes under international law:...

(c) Crimes against humanity:
:Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts done against any civilian population, or persecutions on political, racial, or religious grounds, when such acts are done or such persecutions are carried on in execution of or in connection with any crime against peace or any [[war crime]].}}

[[Telford Taylor]], who was Counsel for the Prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials wrote "[at] the Nuremberg war crimes trials, the tribunals rebuffed several efforts by the prosecution to bring such 'domestic' atrocities within the scope of international law as 'crimes against humanity'".&lt;ref&gt;Telford Taylor [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFDC1439F93BA15750C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "When people kill a people"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 28, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Several subsequent international treaties incorporate this principle, but some have dropped the restriction "in connection with any crime against peace or any war crime" that is in Nuremberg Principles.

The [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], which is binding on 111 states, defines crimes against humanity in Article 7.1. The article criminalises certain acts "committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack". These include:

{{quotation|(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender&lt;ref&gt;Article 7.3 of the Rome Statute, which constitutes "compromise text" states that "For the purpose of this Statute, it is understood that the term 'gender' refers to the two sexes, male and female, within the context of society. The term 'gender' does not indicate any meaning different from the above." While under international criminal law persecution based on Gender Identity is also prohibited, during the Rome Diplomatic Conference that adopted the ICC Statute, it was decided to define gender narrowly in order to overcome opposition from the Holy See and other states that were concerned that the ICC could theoretically also look into discriminatory practices of religious institutions. This provision was balanced with that of Article 10, which states that "Nothing in this Part shall be interpreted as limiting or prejudicing in any way existing or developing rules of international law for purposes other than this Statute."&lt;/ref&gt;...or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph [e.g. murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, apartheid, and other inhumane acts] or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court}}

==Religious==
{{Main|Religious persecution}}
Religious persecution is systematic mistreatment of an individual or group due to their [[Religion|religious affiliation]]. Not only theorists of [[secularization]] (who presume a decline of [[religiosity]] in general) would willingly assume that religious persecution is a thing of the past{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. However, with the rise of [[fundamentalism]] and [[Religious terrorism|religiously related terrorism]], this assumption has become even more controversial{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Indeed, in many countries of the world today, religious persecution is a Human Rights problem.

===Atheists===
{{Main|Persecution of atheists}}
[[Atheism|Atheist]]s have experienced persecution throughout history. Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beating, torture, or execution. It also may refer to the confiscation or destruction of property.

===Bahá'ís===
{{Main|Persecution of Bahá'ís}}
The persecution of Bahá'ís refers to the [[religious persecution]] of Bahá'ís in various countries, especially in [[Iran]],&lt;ref name="fdih1"&gt;{{cite web | date = 2003-08-01 | title = Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran | author = International Federation for Human Rights | publisher = fdih.org | accessdate = 2006-10-20 | url = http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has one of the largest Bahá'í populations in the world. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in Iran, and it represents the largest religious minority in that country.

===Christians===
{{Main|Persecution of Christians}}
[[File:Siemiradzki Christian Dirce.jpg|thumb|400px|''A Christian Dirce'', by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]]. A Christian woman is martyred under [[Nero]] in this re-enactment of the myth of [[Dirce]] (painting by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]], 1897, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]], [[Warsaw]]).]]
The persecution of Christians is [[religious persecution]] that [[Christian]]s may undergo as a consequence of professing [[Christianity|their faith]], both historically and in the current era.  [[Early Christians]] were persecuted for their [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] at the hands of both [[Persecution of Christians by the Jews|Jews]] from [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|whose religion Christianity arose]] and the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]] which controlled much of the [[Early centers of Christianity|land across which early Christianity was distributed]]. [[Christianity in the 4th century|Early in the fourth century]], the religion was legalized by the [[Edict of Milan]], and it eventually became the [[State church of the Roman Empire]].

[[Christian missionaries]], as well as the people that they converted to Christianity, have been the target of persecution, many times to the point of being [[Martyrdom|martyred for their faith]].

There is also a history of individual [[Christian denominations]] suffering persecution at the hands of other Christians under the charge of [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]], particularly during the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]] as well as throughout the Middle Ages when various Christian groups deemed heretical were persecuted by the Papacy.

In the 20th century, Christians have been persecuted by various groups, and by [[state atheism|atheistic states]] such as the [[USSR]] and [[North Korea]]. During the [[Second World War]] members of many Christian churches were persecuted in [[Germany]] for resisting the [[Nazi]] ideology.

In more recent times the Christian missionary organization [[Open Doors]] (UK) estimates 100&amp;nbsp;million Christians face persecution, particularly in [[List of Muslim-majority countries|Muslim-dominated countries]] such as [[Pakistan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Open Doors]]: [http://www.opendoorsuk.org/resources/country_profiles.php The worst 50 countries for persecution of Christians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304014428/http://www.opendoorsuk.org/resources/country_profiles.php |date=2012-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Open Doors: [http://www.opendoors-de.org/downloads/wvi/weltverfolgungsindex2012.pdf Weltverfolgungsindex 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713221505/http://www.opendoors-de.org/downloads/wvi/weltverfolgungsindex2012.pdf |date=2012-07-13 }}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Society for Human Rights]], up to 80% of all acts of persecution are directed against people of the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Philpott |first=Daniel |title=Pope Francis and Religious Freedom |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/pope-francis-and-religious-freedom |publisher=Berkley Center for Religion, Peace &amp; World Affairs |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism)====
{{Main|Anti-Mormonism}}
With the Missouri [[Missouri Executive Order 44|extermination order]] Mormons became the only religious group to have a state of the United States legalize the extermination of their religion. This was after a speech given by Sideny Rigdon called the [[Rigdon's July 4th oration|July 4th Oration]] which while meant to state that Mormons would defend their lives and property was taken as inflammatory. Their forcible expulsion from the state caused the death of over a hundred due to exposure, starvation, and resulting illnesses.  The Mormons suffered through [[tarring and feathering]], their lands and possessions being repeatedly taken from them, mob attacks, false imprisonments, and the US sending an army to Utah to deal with the "Mormon problem" in the [[Utah War]] which resulted in the Mormons massacring settlers at the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]]. A government militia slaughtered Mormons in what is now known as the [[Haun's Mill massacre]].  The founder of the church, [[Joseph Smith]], was killed in [[Carthage, Illinois]] by a mob of about 200 men, almost all of whom were members of the Illinois state militia including some members of the militia who were assigned to guard him.

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
{{Main|Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
Throughout the history of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], their beliefs, doctrines and practices have engendered [[Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses|controversy]] and opposition from local governments, communities, and mainstream Christian groups.

===Falun Gong===
{{Main|Persecution of Falun Gong}}
[[Falun Gong]] was introduced to the general public by [[Li Hongzhi]](李洪志) in [[Changchun]], [[China]], in 1992. For the next few years, Falun Gong was the fastest growing ''[[qigong]]'' practice in Chinese history and, by 1999, there were between 70 and 100 million people practicing Falun Gong in China.&lt;ref name=Stats&gt;Source of Statistical Information, [http://www.faluninfo.net/article/517/?ci=5 Number of Falun Gong practitioners in China in 1999: at least 70 million, Falun Dafa Information Center], accessed 01/01/08&lt;/ref&gt; Following the seven years of widespread popularity, on July 20, 1999, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] began a nationwide persecution campaign against Falun Gong practitioners, except in the special administrative regions of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;Faison, Seth (April 27, 1999) [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/042799china-protest.html "In Beijing: A Roar of Silent Protesters"] ''New York Times'', retrieved June 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Joseph (April 27, 1999) [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/042799china-protest-leader.html "Notoriety Now for Exiled Leader of Chinese Movement"] ''New York Times'', retrieved June 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1999, legislation was created to outlaw "heterodox religions" and retroactively applied to Falun Gong.&lt;ref name="Leung"&gt;Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 – 784&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] states that the persecution is "politically motivated" with "legislation being used retroactively to convict people on {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}driven charges, and new regulations introduced to further restrict fundamental freedoms".&lt;ref name=Amnesty1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030711022606/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA170112000 The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called ''heretical organizations'' ], The Amnesty International&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindus===
{{Main|Persecution of Hindus}}
Persecution of Hindus refers to the [[religious persecution]] inflicted upon [[Hindu]]s. Hindus have been historically persecuted during the [[Islam]]ic rule of the [[Indian subcontinent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durant|first=Will|title=The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental Heritage|page=459|quote=The Mohammedan Conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order and liberty, culture and peace may at any time be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within. The Hindus had allowed their strength to be wasted in internal division and war; they had adopted religions like Buddhism and Jainism, which unnerved them for the tasks of life; they had failed to organize their forces for the protection of their frontiers and their capitals, their wealth and their freedom, from the hordes of Scythians, Huns, Afghans and Turks hovering about India's boundaries and waiting for national weakness to let them in. For four hundred years (600–1000 AD) India invited conquest; and at last it came.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Goa Inquisition|rule]] of [[Goa]]. In modern times, Hindus in [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] have also suffered persecution. Most recently, thousands of Hindus from [[Sindh]] province in Pakistan have been fleeing to [[India]] voicing fear for their safety. After the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, there were 8.8 million Hindus in Pakistan (excluding Bangladesh) in 1951. In 1951, Hindus constituted 22% of the Pakistani population (including present-day Bangladesh which formed part of Pakistan).&lt;ref&gt;Census of Pakistan, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7zNuAAAAMAAJ Hindu Masjids] by Prafull Goradia, 2002 "In 1951, Muslims were 77 percent and Hindus were 22 percent."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Hindu minority amounts to 1.7 percent of Pakistan's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/area_pop/area_pop.html Census of Pakistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222185234/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/area_pop/area_pop.html |date=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] (1971) resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army's onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. An article in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] dated 2 August 1971, stated "The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,878408,00.html |title=World: Pakistan: The Ravaging of Golden Bengal - Printout |publisher=TIME |date=2 August 1971 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] wrote in a report that was part of [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] testimony dated 1 November 1971, "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked "H". All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from [[Islamabad]]". In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as [[UNESCO]] and [[World Health Organization]] the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. In a syndicated column "The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored", [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist [[Sydney Schanberg]]  wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. "Other reminders were the yellow "H"s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army" (by "Muslim army", meaning the [[Pakistan Army]], which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), ([[Newsday]], 29 April 1994).
 	
In Bangladesh, on 28 February 2013, the [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|International Crimes Tribunal]] sentenced [[Delwar Hossain Sayeedi]], the Vice President of the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] to death for the war crimes committed during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. Following the sentence, activists of [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and its student wing [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami#Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir|Islami Chhatra Shibir]] attacked the Hindus in different parts of the country. Hindu properties were looted, Hindu houses were burnt into ashes and Hindu temples were desecrated and set on fire.&lt;ref name="English reference"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindus Under Attack in Bangladesh|url=http://en.newsbharati.com/Encyc/2013/3/3/Hindus-under-attack-in-Bangladesh.aspx|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=News Bharati|date=March 3, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317035708/http://en.newsbharati.com/Encyc/2013/3/3/Hindus-under-attack-in-Bangladesh.aspx|archivedate=March 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bagerhat Hindu Temple Set on Fire|url=http://dev-bd.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=241410&amp;cid=2|accessdate=March 20, 2013|newspaper=bdnews24.com|date=March 2, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130407194310/http://dev-bd.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=241410&amp;cid=2|archivedate=April 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence included the looting of Hindu properties and businesses, the burning of Hindu homes, the rape of Hindu women,{{cn|date=August 2018}} and the [[desecration]] and destruction of, according to community leaders, more than 50 [[Hindu temples]]; 1,500 Hindu homes were destroyed in 20 districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh: Wave of violent attacks against Hindu minority|url=http://amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/bangladesh-wave-violent-attacks-against-hindu-minority-2013-03-06#.UTeKDSrYyD8.twitter|work=Press releases|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc09032013-1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21712655|title=Bangladesh minorities 'terrorised' after mob violence|last=Ethirajan|first=Anbarasan|date=9 March 2013|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 March 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the government has held the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] responsible for the attacks on the minorities, the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] leadership has denied any involvement.

[[File:Massacre of Jews in Lietūkis garage.jpeg|thumb|[[Kaunas pogrom]] in [[German occupation of Lithuania during World War II|German-occupied Lithuania]], June 1941]]
Persecution of Jews is a recurring phenomenon throughout [[Jewish history]]. It has occurred on numerous occasions and in widely different geographical locations. It may include [[pogrom]]s, [[looting]] and demolition of private and public Jewish property (e.g., [[Kristallnacht]]), unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, [[torture]], killing, or even mass execution (in [[World War II]] alone, approximately 6 million people were deliberately killed for the sole reason of being Jewish). They have been expelled from their hometowns/countries, hoping to find havens in other polities. In recent times [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] has often been manifested as [[Anti-Zionism]],&lt;ref&gt;[[New antisemitism]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=84|title=New Anti-Semitism: Disguised As "Anti-Zionism" - Discover the Networks|website=www.discoverthenetworks.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/Antizionism.htm|title=Anti-zionism as an expression of anti-Semitism in recent years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=huji.ac.il|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512173240/http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/Antizionism.htm|archivedate=12 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that there are various Jewish groups whose members themselves oppose the idea of [[Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anti-Zionism#Jewish anti-Zionism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Persecution of Muslims|Persecution of Ahmadis|}}
The persecution of [[Muslim]]s has been a recurring phenomenon throughout the [[history of Islam]]. Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beatings, torture, or execution. It may also refer to the confiscation or destruction of property, or incitement to hate Muslims.

Persecution can extend beyond those who perceive themselves to be Muslims and include those who are perceived by others as Muslims, or it can include Muslims who are considered non-Muslims by fellow Muslims. The [[Ahmadiyya]] regard themselves as Muslims, but are seen by many other Muslims as non-Muslims and "heretics". In 1984, the Government of [[Pakistan]], under General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], passed [[Ordinance XX]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepersecution.org/50years/paklaw.html|title=Government of Pakistan – Law for Ahmadis|website=www.thepersecution.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which banned proselytizing by Ahmadis and also banned Ahmadis from referring to themselves as [[Muslim]]s. According to this ordinance, any Ahmadi who refers to oneself as a Muslim by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, directly or indirectly, or makes the call for prayer as other Muslims do, is punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years. Because of these difficulties, [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]] migrated to London.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The Indian government reported 2,700 deaths in the ensuing chaos.

==Ethnic==
{{Main|Racism}}
Ethnic persecution refers to perceived persecution based on [[ethnicity]]. Its meaning is parallel to that of [[racism]], (based on [[Race (human classification)|race]]).  The [[Rwandan genocide]] remains an atrocity that the indigenous [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] peoples still believe is unforgivable.  The [[Japanese occupation of China]] caused the death of millions of people, mostly peasants who were murdered after the [[Doolittle Raid]] in early-World War II.

===Germans===
{{Main|Organised persecution of ethnic Germans}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
The persecution of [[ethnic German]]s refers to systematic activity against groups of ethnic Germans based on their ethnicity. &lt;!-- There should be some mention in this section of the article of the English aristocracy, who were of German lineage (i.e. the Hapsburgs...) changing their Germanic names to Anglicized versions... ~~~~ --&gt;

Historically, this has been due to two causes: the German population was considered, whether factually or not, linked with German nationalist regimes such as those of the [[Nazis]] or [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]]. This was the case in the World War I era persecution of Germans in the [[United States]], and also in Eastern and Central Europe following the end of World War II.  While many victims of these persecutions did not, in fact, have any connection to those regimes, cooperation between German minority organisations and Nazi regime did occur, as the example of [[Selbstschutz]] shows, which is still used as a pretense of hostilities against those who did not take part in such organisations. After World War II, many such [[Volksdeutsche]] were killed or driven from their homes {{Who|date=December 2009}} in acts of vengeance, others in ethnic cleansing of territories prior to populating them with citizens of the annexing country.{{Where|date=July 2011}} In other cases (e.g. in the case of the formerly large German-speaking populations of Russia, Estonia, or the Transylvanian (Siebenbürgen) German minority in Rumania and the Balkans) such persecution was a crime committed against innocent communities who had played no part in the [[Third Reich]].

===Hazara people===
{{Main|Persecution of Hazara people}}
The [[Hazara people]] of central [[Afghanistan]] have been persecuted by [[Afghan]] rulers at various times in the history. Since the tragedy of 9/11, [[Sunni|Sunni Muslim]] [[terrorism|terrorists]] have been attacking the Hazara community in southwestern Pakistani town of [[Quetta]], home to some 500,000 Hazara who fled persecution in neighbouring Afghanistan. Some 2,400 men, women and children have been killed or wounded with [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] claiming responsibility for most of the attacks against the community. Consequently, many thousands have fled the country seeking [[asylum in Australia]].

===Roma===
{{Main|Antiziganism|Porajmos}}
Antiziganism is hostility, [[prejudice]], discrimination or [[racism]] directed against the [[Romani people]] as an ethnic group, or people who are perceived as being of Romani heritage.

The ''Porajmos'' was the planned and attempted effort, often described as a [[genocide]], during [[World War II]] by the government of [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies to exterminate the Romani (Gypsy) people of Europe. Under the rule of [[Adolf Hitler]], a supplementary decree to the [[Nuremberg Laws]] was issued on 26 November 1935, defining Gypsies as "enemies of the race-based state", the same category as Jews. Thus, the fate of Roma in Europe in some ways paralleled that of the Jews.&lt;ref name=USHMM_2&gt;{{cite web |title=Holocaust Encyclopedia - Genocide of European Roma (Gypsies), 1939-1945 |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005219 |accessdate=9 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians estimate that 220,000 to 500,000 Romani were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators, or more than 25% of the slightly less than 1 million Roma in Europe at the time.&lt;ref name=USHMM_2/&gt; [[Ian Hancock]] puts the death toll as high as 1.5 million.&lt;ref name=Milton_estimates&gt;{{Citation |chapter=True Romanies and the Holocaust: A Re-evaluation and an overview |chapter-url=http://www.radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_e_holocaust_porrajmos&amp;lang=en&amp;articles= |author=Hancock, Ian |title=The Historiography of the Holocaust |isbn=1-4039-9927-9 |pages=383–396 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rohingyas===
{{Seealso|2017 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar}}
The UN human rights chief slammed Myanmar's apparent "systematic attack" on the [[Rohingya]] minority, warning that "ethnic cleansing" seemed to be underway.
Ethnic Rohingya Muslims fleeing security forces in Myanmar’s Rakhine State have described killings, shelling, and arson in their villages that have all the hallmarks of a campaign of “ethnic cleansing,” Human Rights Watch said.
“Rohingya refugees have harrowing accounts of fleeing Burmese army attacks and watching their villages be destroyed,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director. “Lawful operations against armed groups do not involve burning the local population out of their homes.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/world/south-asia/atrocities-rohingyas-myanmar-have-hallmarks-ethnic-cleansing-hrw-1459276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Based on genetics==

===People with albinism===
{{Main|Persecution of people with albinism}}
Persecution on the basis of [[albinism]] is frequently based on the belief that albinos are inferior to persons with higher concentration of [[melanin]] in their skin. As a result, albinos have been persecuted, killed and dismembered, and graves of albinistic people dug up and desecrated. Such people have also been ostracized and even killed because they are presumed to bring ''bad'' luck in some areas.  Haiti also has a long history of treating albinistic people as accursed, with the highest incidence under the influence of [[François Duvalier|François "Papa Doc" Duvalier]].

==Of people with autism==
{{Main|Persecution of people with autism}}
People with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s have commonly been victims of persecution, both throughout history and in the present era. In [[Cameroon]] children with autism are commonly accused of [[witchcraft]] and singled out for torture and even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaontheblog.com/the-thin-line-between-autism-and-witchcraft-in-cameroon/|title=The Thin Line Between Autism and Witchcraft in Cameroon|date=11 April 2014|website=africaontheblog.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icare4autism.org/news/2010/07/children-with-autism-branded-as-witches/|title=Autism Services - New York - ICare4Autism|website=Autism Services - New York - ICare4Autism|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it is speculated that many of the disabled children murdered during [[Action T4]] in [[Nazi Germany]] may have been autistic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/yoursay/2015/11/02/neurotribes-steve-silberman-on-a-haunting-history-and-new-hope-for-autistic-people/|title=NeuroTribes, Steve Silberman on a haunting history and new hope for autistic people - Your Say|website=Your Say|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making autistic people among the first victims of [[The Holocaust]].

==LGBT==
{{Globalize|section|date=July 2017}}

A number of countries, especially those in the [[Western world]], have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against [[sexual minorities]], including laws against anti-gay [[hate crimes]] and [[workplace discrimination]]. Some have also legalized [[same-sex marriage]] or [[civil union]]s in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the [[United Nations]] passed its first resolution recognizing [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] and, in 2015, same-sex marriage was legalized in all states of the [[United States]].

==Based on military service==
Persecution on the basis of army service (or the lack of it) operates in [[Israeli society]]. In the [[State of Israel]], Jewish citizens who receive an exemption from [[Conscription in Israel | service]] in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] cannot take up many prestigious career options, especially in the field of [[security (disambiguation) | security]]. The root of discrimination on the basis of army service lies in the practice that at age 17, non-Arab citizens (including [[Druze]]) are called up to be examined for eligibility to [[compulsory military service]]. A record for each potential conscript is made. Those who actually serve in the military are distinguished from those rejected from service by a Discharge Card, which has additional information on it, including the soldier's rank, military profession, and behavior during army service. Potential employers show a particular interest in Discharge Cards, since they constitute a universally available source of information about a potential employee. Employers frequently look down upon  citizens rejected from the army, typically believing that "those who are unfit for army service are also unfit for the work environment",{{cn|date=September 2016}} and that  those who succeeded in the army are also likely to become good employees. Job advertisements in Israel very frequently specify a requirement of "Full Army Service", thus the decisions taken by the draft board regarding a 17-year-old minor may affect entire careers.

In fiction, [[Robert A. Heinlein]] depicts a society where [[suffrage]] rights depend on military service in his 1959 novel ''[[Starship Troopers]].''

== History ==

Founder and CEO Craig "Tooey" Courtemanche created the software that became Procore as a response to his struggles to manage the construction of his new home in Santa Barbara, from his then-current home in Silicon Valley.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

The company had 6 employees at the time of its founding in 2003, originally headquartered in [[Montecito, CA]].&lt;ref name="pacificbiz" /&gt; The campus is currently situated on a 9-acre oceanfront property. Procore expanded their offices in 2015 to encompass 61,079 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoagland|first1=Ted|title=Carpinteria’s Oceanfront CKE Campus Leases Filled in Fourth Quarter|url=http://www.noozhawk.com/homes_lifestyle/article/carpinterias_oceanfront_cke_campus_leases_filled_in_fourth_quarter|website=Noozhawk|publisher=Malamute Ventures|date=7 Jan 2016|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to architecture firm Kingdom Industry who designed the new space, the office was intentionally designed to feel spatially chaotic and elicit alertness and adaptability in employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rhodes|first1=Margaret|title=The Startup That Designed Its Office To Confuse Workers|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/06/procore-office-disorienting-enriched-environment/|website=Wired|publisher=Conde Nast|date=30 June 2015|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:DJI00014 (13092087674) (2).jpg|thumb|Procore HQ in Carpinteria CA]]

'''Purple''' is a common term in politics for governments or other political entities consisting of parties that have red and blue as their [[political colour]]s. It is of particular note in two areas: in the politics of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] and in the [[politics of the United States]]. 

==Belgium and the Netherlands==
"Purple" ({{lang-nl|Paars}}) is the nickname of a government coalition of [[social democracy|social democrats]] and [[Liberalism in Europe|liberals]], excluding [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]. It is derived from the combination of the colour of the social democrats (red) and liberals (blue).

Both the Netherlands and Belgium have had such governments. In the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] the two cabinets of Prime Minister [[Wim Kok]] ([[First Kok cabinet|Kok I]] and [[Second Kok cabinet|Kok II]], 1994–2002) were composed of social democrats (the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], PvdA), conservative liberals ([[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]], VVD) and progressive liberals ([[Democrats 66]]).

In the [[2010 Dutch cabinet formation]] the possibilities for a ''Purple-plus'' cabinet (the original "purple" coalition of PvdA, VVD, D66 plus [[GreenLeft]]) was investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-wont-get-purple-plus-government |title=Dutch won&amp;#039;t get &amp;#34;Purple Plus&amp;#34; government &amp;#124; RNW Media |website=Rnw.nl |date= |accessdate=2016-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626013910/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-wont-get-purple-plus-government |archive-date=26 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-purple-plus-talks-fai ]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/purple-plus-didnt-fail-lack-time |title=Purple-plus didn&amp;#039;t fail for lack of time &amp;#124; RNW Media |website=Rnw.nl |date= |accessdate=2016-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101163603/http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/purple-plus-didnt-fail-lack-time |archive-date=1 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 5 November 2012, following the [[Dutch general election, 2012|2012 Dutch general election]], the VVD has been the senior partner in the [[second Rutte cabinet]], a [[grand coalition]] Purple government with the PvdA.

In October 2013 the [[Second Rutte cabinet]] (VVD and PvdA), which has no majority in the ''[[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]]'', reached a budgetary agreement with D66 and the smaller [[Christian politics|Christian]] parties [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]] (CU) and the [[Reformed Political Party]] (SGP). This occasional coalition is nicknamed "purple plus the Bible" (''Paars met de Bijbel'') as it includes the purple parties VVD, PvdA and D66 plus the Bible-minded parties CU and SGP. The term "purple plus the Bible" had already been used in February that year, when the same parties reached an agreement on modernising the housing market. Secretary of Financial Affairs, [[Jeroen Dijsselbloem]] (PvdA) now calls D66, CU and SGP his "most beloved opposition parties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/schaduw/kabinet-werkenderwijs-verder-met-oppositie |title=Kabinet 'werkenderwijs' verder met oppositie - RTL Nieuws |language=nl |website=Rtlnieuws.nl |date= |accessdate=2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three parties are very influential on the policy of the Second Rutte cabinet, because without the support of the three parties, new parliamentary elections are inevitable.

In the [[Dutch municipal elections, 2014|municipal elections of 19 March 2014]] D66, CU and SGP did well. D66 for instance, became the biggest party in [[Amsterdam]] and [[The Hague]], beating the PvdA. The CU became the biggest party in [[Zwolle]], hometown of CU-leader [[Arie Slob]]. All three parties were rewarded for their so-called "constructive co-operation" with the cabinet. However, the coalition parties VVD and PvdA lost a lot of seats (PvdA lost its majority in Amsterdam, The Hague, [[Rotterdam]], [[Groningen]] etc. and the VVD did equally bad).

In [[Politics of Belgium|Belgian politics]], the term is used as a term for the two federal governments of Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]], from 1999 to  2008. These cabinets consisted of the Flemish and Francophone social-democratic parties ([[Socialistische Partij Anders|SP.A]] and [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|PS]]) and the Flemish and Francophone liberal parties ([[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] and the [[Liberal Reformist Party]], which later became Open VLD and the [[Mouvement Réformateur|Reformist Movement]]). The [[Verhofstadt I Government|first government]] also included the Flemish and Francophone [[green politics|green]] parties [[Groen!|Agalev]] and [[Ecolo]].

==United States==
{{main|Red states and blue states}}
In the United States, a purple state is one where popular support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (red) and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] (blue) is approximately equal; such states, in elections for the President of the United States, are termed "[[swing state]]s" and are highly targeted on account of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College system]] of electing the [[President of the United States]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Purple states can also appear with the control of different branches. For example, a Democrat governor with Republican controlled [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], or a Republican governor with Democrat controlled state legislature.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

|logo=|former_name=|established=1775|founder=Grand Duke Peter Leopold of Habsburg-Lorraine}}The '''Reale Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale''' (Royal Museum of Physics and Natural History) was an Italian museum founded on February 22, 1775 in [[Florence]] that survived until 1878, when its collections were split up in various Florentine museums.[[File:Saggio del Real gabinetto di fisica e di storia naturale di Firenze (Roma, 1775).tif|thumb|Saggio del Real gabinetto di fisica e di storia naturale di Firenze (Roma, 1775)]]

== Origins ==
In the 1760&lt;nowiki/&gt;s Grand Duke of Tuscany Peter Leopold, urged by the Florence scientific community, decided to rearrange the scientific and [[natural history collection]]s that were put together by the [[House of Medici|Medici]] family and increased in the following centuries.

In 1763 physician and naturalist [[Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti]] had already catalogued the natural specimens housed in the Galleria Imperiale in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Catalogo delle produzioni naturali che si conservano nella Galleria imperiale di Firenze disteso nell'anno 1763 per ordine di sua eccellenza ... Antoniotto Botta Adorno|last=Targioni Tozzetti|first=Giovanni|publisher=|year=1763|isbn=|edition= manuscript|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766 the Grand Duke instructed Trentine physiologist [[Felice Fontana]] to gather the collections of scientific instruments housed in the [[Palazzo Pitti|Pitti Palace]]. In 1771 he also collected a large part of the Medici instruments that were kept in the ''Stanzino delle Matematiche'' (Mathematics Room) of the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]]. Restoration works of the Torrigiani Palace, that had to become home to the Reale Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale, began in 1772.

On the iniziative of the Grand Duke, Fontana was surrounded with a small group of young scholars which included [[Giovanni Fabbroni]], with whom Fontana established a close relationship.

The museum was officially opened in 1775 under the direction of Fontana, who was supported by Fabbroni as deputy director.

== The Collections ==
[[File:Biglietto d'ingresso del Reale Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale di Firenze.tif|thumb|Ticket for the visit of the Royal Museum of Physics and Natural History of Florence]]
Since its foundation, the Reale Museo housed scientific instruments, natural specimens and a large collection of anatomical wax models that came from previous collections or were specially made to be displayed in the new museum.

The very first nucleus of the scientific instruments housed in the museum came from the physics laboratory in the [[Palazzo Pitti|Pitti Palace]]. Then came 202 objects from the Medici collections in the Uffizi Gallery, that comprised measuring, mathematical and astronomical instruments—including Galileo's geometrical and military compass and the lens he used to observe the sky, [[Ignazio Danti|Egnazio Danti]]'s instrument of the [[Primum Mobile]], Giovan Battista Giusti's quadrants, Della Volpaia's sundials and nocturnals, and Antonio Santucci's armillary sphere. Finally, the instruments of the Accademia del Cimento were moved from the Pitti Palace to the Reale Museo as well.

As far as natural history specimens, the museum housed the collections rearranged by [[Targioni Tozzetti]], including [[Pier Antonio Micheli]]'s herbaria and the collections of Dutch naturalist Georg Everhard Rumph and Danish physician and geologist Niels Steensen.

The engagement of wax modeller [[Clemente Susini]] made it possible to create a great lot of anatomical wax models portraying human body's musculature, internal organs, bones, the eye, the ear, and the nose. Six rooms were needed to display the many wax models.

The collection first core was enlarged in the following years with new exhibits that were made—first for studying reasons, then especially for educational reasons—by the workshops that were housed in the Torrigiani Palace since the Reale Museum's beginnings.

== The Botanical Garden and the Specola ==
[[File:Giardino Botanico Reale Museo Firenze mappa.tif|thumb|Map of the Royal Museum Botanical Garden]]

The Torrigiani Palace bordered [[Boboli Gardens]]—and this was a good chance to create a botanical garden, whose direction was entrusted to Attilio Zuccagni. The garden sheltered several species of plants classified according to Linnaean taxonomy, that assigned an appropriate name and class to each plant, pointing out its possible medical use as well.

While the renovation works of the palace were underway, Fontana had already a mind to turn the ''Torrino'' (small tower) into an astronomical and meteorological observatory. When in 1775 he met [[Johann III Bernoulli]], astronomer to the [[King of Prussia]] and director of the [[Berlin]] observatory, Fontana asked him some suggestions, but the grand-ducal court agreed only partly with Bernoulli's ideas. The shortage of skilled craftsmen made Fontana decide to buy the needed instruments in London. The great expenses caused a big time lag in the completion of works, that continued until 1796, when Fabbroni assigned the astronomer Domenico de Vecchi the responsibility of reorganizing the observatory and beginning to collect astronomical data.

Fontana thought that the museum had to be arranged according to the order of nature, appropriately classified. The ground floor housed, in addition to the storerooms, minerals from [[Tuscany]] and the chemistry laboratory; the [[physics]] laboratory, the library and the [[zoology]] collections were located at the first floor; wax models, stuffed animals, [[fossil]]s, and precious stones were on display at the second floor. Visitors and scholars were thus able to travel from microcosm—chemistry—through the elements of nature, to macrocosm—astronomy—in the [[observatory]].

== The Liceo ==
Fontana would have liked to found a "society of scientists"—a new [[Accademia del Cimento]]—aimed at researching and disseminating new discoveries, but the grand-ducal court didn't support his plan because it was too expensive. Fabbroni, who took Fontana's place as museum director in 1805, complemented research with educational activity. But it was only his successor, Girolamo Bardi, who was able to open a ''liceo'' [high school] in the Torrigiani Place in 1807.

The first chairs to be established were [[Botany|Botanics]] and [[Anatomy]]—hold by Ottaviano Targioni Tozzetti and the surgeon Filippo Uccelli respectively—but four more were soon created. The subjects taught in the ''liceo'' were six, namely Chemistry, Experimental and theoretical physics, Astronomy, Natural history, and Comparative anatomy.

The ''liceo'' was actually a short-life adventure, because Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Lorraine—who came back into power after Napoleon I's fall—wanted the museum to interrupt educational activities and go back to conservation and research.

Vincenzo Antinori, who became the museum director in 1829, started again the pedagogical project and established the chairs of Physics, Comparative anatomy and [[zoology]], and [[mineralogy]] and geology, which were granted to [[Leopoldo Nobili]], Gaspero Mazzi and Filippo Nesti respectively. Educational and museological duties were closely connected as the full professors were the curators of the collections as well. New chairs were created in the following years, so making the ''liceo'' a more and more important institute for both specialized studies and research.

== The Italian Central Meteorological Archives ==
In 1839, on the occasion of the First Conference of Italian Scientists in [[Pisa]], the attendees celebrated the development of meteorological studies and stressed the need for turning meteorology into a science. The museum welcomed this hope and in 1844 released a memorandum asking Italian observatories to help in the creation of a Central Meteorological Archives. The goal was collecting, arranging and publishing all data from meteorological observations in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antinori|first=Vincenzio|year=1858|title=Proemio|url=|journal=Archivio meteorologico centrale italiano nell'I. e R. Museo di fisica e storia naturale|volume=1|pages=III-XVIII|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation and the exchange of information was regarded as the condition necessary to the advancement of meteorology in Italy and worldwide. Accordingly, the Archives established a close network of relationships with observatories as well as [[European Union|European]] and [[United States|US]]. scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblioteca.imss.fi.it/856/archivio_amci.pdf|title=Fondo dell'Archivio meteorologico centrale italiano, Museo Galileo Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Move of Collections ==
In 1859 the museum was turned into the section of Physical and Natural Sciences of the Istituto di Studi Superiori Pratici e di Perfezionamento (Institute for Advanced and Specialized Studies), that was founded in [[Florence]] by the Provisional Government of [[Tuscany]].

From then on, educational activities, research and conservation of the collections became more and more separated. In 1872 astronomical observations were moved to the new [[Observatory]] at [[Arcetri Observatory|Arcetri.]] The instruments and machines used for teaching were placed in the various sections of the Istituto, which were destined to become the departments of the [[University of Florence]]. Zoology collections remained in the Torrigiani Palace, which is today home to [[La Specola]] Museum. Botanical specimens were gathered in the [[Giardino dei Semplici]] (the botanical garden). The exhibit of historical [[Scientific instrument|instrument]]s in the Tribune of Galileo and the adjacent rooms remained unchanged and in 1874 was named Museo degli Strumenti Antichi di [[Astronomia]] e di Fisica (Museum of Ancient Astronomical and Physics Instruments). In 1875, Ferdinando Meucci began to catalogue those instruments that in 1929, after some ups and downs, became the patrimony of the [[Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza]]—today's [[Museo Galileo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblioteca.imss.fi.it/856/archivio_msa.pdf|title=Archivio del Museo degli strumenti antichi di astronomia e di fisica di Firenze, Museo Galileo Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Archives of the Reale Museo ==
Archival records produced by the Reale Museo between 1780 and 1872, which were first stored in the Department of Physics at the University of [[Florence]], are today housed in the Museo Galileo's Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museogalileo.it/en/explore/libraries/library/archive/archivemusemphysicsnaturalhistoryflorence.html|title=ARMU-Archive of the Royal Museum of physics and natural history of Florence|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This collection is the most important source to reconstruct the history of the Reale Museo and its relationships with the main scientific institutions in Europe as well as to know the many instruments of the museum collections and the related events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2995">The '''Rosenholz files''' are a collection of 381 [[CD-ROM]]s containing 280,000 files with information on persons who were sources and targets or employees and helpers in the focus of the ''[[Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung]]'' (''HVA'', Main Directorate for Reconnaissance), the primary foreign intelligence agency of the former [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany). At the beginning it was thought that the files mostly contain the real names of agents who worked for the HVA in the former [[West Germany]]. Later it became clear that at least 90% of the persons never worked for or with the HVA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bstu.bund.de/DE/Wissen/Aktenfunde/Rosenholz/rosenholz_node.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosenholz files ended up in the hands of the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) during the [[German reunification]] under unclear circumstances; they were initially analysed by the United States only, but finally returned to [[Germany]] in 2003 after long negotiations. The exact reason for the duration of the negotiations is still debated among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bstu.bund.de/DE/Wissen/Aktenfunde/Rosenholz/rosenholz_node.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the annals of the former [[Moscow]] CIA station chief [[Milton Bearden]], the Rosenholz files were not seized on January 15, 1990, when demonstrators stormed the [[Stasi|Ministry of State Security]] in [[East Berlin]], but instead only when [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] personally contacted the chief of the [[Berlin]] CIA station. Bearden later on lobbied for the return of the Rosenholz files to the ''[[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]]'' ({{lang-de|Der Bundesbeauftragte für die Stasi-Unterlagen, BStU}}) while CIA station chief in [[Bonn]], and received the German government's ''[[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Bundesverdienstkreuz]]'' (Federal Cross of Merit).

After being returned, the files were checked for mistranslation and other errors by the BStU; since March 2004, the files have in theory been open to the general public and can be viewed following an appropriate request (''Antrag auf persönliche Akteneinsicht''). However, because of the unclear compilation of the files, many requests were turned down.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bstu.bund.de/DE/Wissen/Aktenfunde/Rosenholz/rosenholz_node.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SCAMPER''' is an acronym that provides a structured way of assisting students to [[Thinking outside the box|think out of the box]] and enhance their [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Michalko2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael |last=Michalko|title=Thinkertoys: A Handbook of Creative-Thinking Techniques|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=y7O_6v1c52wC}}|date=1 December 2010|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|isbn=978-0-307-75790-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought to protect students' [[creativity]] as they mature.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Elberle, Developing Imagination Through Scamper&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

SCAMPER was proposed by [[Alex Faickney Osborn]] in 1953, and was further developed by Bob Eberle in 1971 in his book; ''SCAMPER:  Games for Imagination Development''.&lt;ref name="Eberle1996"&gt;{{cite book|first=Bob |last=Eberle|title=Scamper: Games for Imagination Development|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0Gmx_jr64RMC}}|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Prufrock Press Inc.|isbn=978-1-882664-24-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

SCAMPER is an activity based thinking process that can be performed by [[Cooperative learning]]. Here the [[teacher]] assists the students in choosing a particular topic and helps them to develop it through a structured process. After choosing an idea, the students are given a tale where they perform the activity in steps corresponding to the letters in the name.

* ''Substitute'' comes up with another topic that is equivalent to the present topic. 
* ''Combine'' adds information to the original topic. 
* ''Adjust'' identifies ways to construct the topic in a more flexible and adjusted material. 
* ''Modify'' creatively changes the topic. 
* ''Put to other uses'' identifies the possible scenarios and situations where this topic can be used. 
* ''Eliminate'' removes ideas or elements from the topic that are not valuable. 
* ''Reverse, rearrange'' evolves a new concept from the original concept.

Hence, SCAMPER as a teaching strategy helps the students to analyse the knowledge in its creative form and helps the teacher to make teaching creative and interesting.

SCAMPER also provides a ‘hip-pocket’ tool; i.e., an unplanned method of developing questions on an impromptu basis designed to challenge meeting participants' [[creativity]] and to make their thinking visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mgrush.com/blog/2013/05/02/scamper/#!/home|title=SCAMPER is a Mnemonic Prompt for Excellent Impromptu Questions Dashboard|date=2 May 2013|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salamander from The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry.jpg|thumb|A 16th-century image of a salamander from ''the Book of Lambspring'']]
The '''[[salamander]]''' is an [[amphibian]] of the order [[Salamander|Urodela]] which, as with many real creatures, often has been ascribed fantastic and sometimes [[occult]] qualities by pre-modern authors (as in the allegorical descriptions of animals in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[bestiary|bestiaries]]) not possessed by the real organism. The legendary salamander is often depicted as a typical salamander in shape, with a [[lizard]]-like form, but is usually ascribed an affinity with [[fire]], sometimes specifically [[Fire (classical element)|elemental fire]].

==Classical, Medieval, and Renaissance lore==
This legendary creature embodies the fantastic qualities that ancient and medieval commentators ascribed to the natural [[salamander]]. Many of these qualities are rooted in verifiable traits of the natural creature but often exaggerated. A large body of [[legend]], [[mythology]], and [[symbol]]ism has developed around this creature over the centuries.

===Classical lore: Pliny, the Talmud, and Augustine===
In one of the earliest surviving descriptions of a salamander, [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 CE) noted that the creature is ''"an animal like a lizard in shape and with a body specked all over; it never comes out except during heavy showers and goes away the moment the weather becomes clear."''&lt;ref&gt;"sicut salamandrae, animal lacertae figura, stellatum, numquam nisi magnis imbribus proveniens et serenitate desinens"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]], eds., London: Taylor and Francis, 1855. Translation slightly modified.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these traits, even down to the star-like markings, are consistent with the [[Salamandra atra aurorae|golden Alpine salamander]] (''Salamandra atra aurorae'') of Europe that has golden or yellow spots or blotches on its back&lt;ref name="van der Meijden"&gt;*{{cite web |url=http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/amphib_query?table=amphib&amp;special=one_record&amp;where-genus=Salamandra&amp;where-species=atra |title=AmphibiaWeb: ''Salamandra atra'' |author=Arie van der Meijden |date=1999-12-30 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some similarly marked subspecies of the [[fire salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra'').&lt;ref name="Kuzmin"&gt;*{{cite web|url=http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/amphib_query?table=amphib&amp;special=one_record&amp;where-genus=Salamandra&amp;where-species=salamandra|title=AmphibiaWeb: ''Salamandra salamandra''|author=Sergius L. Kuzmin|date=1999-10-06}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny even made the important distinction between salamanders and lizards, which are similar in shape but different in other respects, which was not systematized until modern times, when [[Biology|biologists]] [[Scientific classification|classified]] lizards as [[reptile]]s and salamanders as amphibians.

Pliny recounts several other traits which are less credible, such as the ability to extinguish fire with the frigidity of their bodies, a quality which was reported as hearsay by [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Animals]]'', Book V, Ch. XVII, Sec. 13 in the Cresswell translation&lt;/ref&gt; While Pliny notes this in Book 10, Chapter 86 of the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', in Book 29, Chapter 23 of the same work he views this idea with skepticism, pointing out that if such an idea were true, it should be easy to demonstrate.

Pliny also notes medicinal and poisonous properties, which are founded in fact on some level, since many species of salamander, including fire salamanders and Alpine salamanders, excrete toxic, physiologically active substances. These substances are often excreted when the animal is threatened, which has the effect of deterring predators.&lt;ref name="van der Meijden" /&gt; The extent of these properties is greatly exaggerated though, with a single salamander being regarded as so toxic that by twining around a tree it could poison the fruit and so kill any who ate them and by falling into a well could slay all who drank from it.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite book | author=White, T. H. |authorlink=T. H. White |title=The Book of Beasts: Being a Translation From a Latin Bestiary of the Twelfth Century |year=1992 |origyear=1954 |pages= 183–184 |publisher=[[Alan Sutton]] |location=Stroud |isbn=978-0-7509-0206-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The salamander is also mentioned in the [[Talmud]] (Hagiga 27a) as a creature that is a product of fire, and it relates that anyone who is smeared with its blood will be immune to harm from fire. [[Rashi]] (1040–1105), the primary commentator on the Talmud, describes the salamander as one which is produced by burning a fire in the same place for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://independent.academia.edu/RudolphKlein/Papers/1223468/Salamandra_and_the_Flames_of_Hell Salamandra and the Flames of Hell]" by Reb Chaim HaQoton&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Saint Augustine]] in the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' used the example of salamanders to argue for the possibility of humans being punished by being burned in eternal flame in [[Purgatory]]. He wrote "If, therefore, the salamander lives in fire, as naturalists have recorded, and if certain famous mountains of Sicily have been continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until now, and yet remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing examples that everything which burns is not consumed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine|page=454 (Book 21, Ch. 4)|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102|author=Augustine of Hippo|editor=Philip Schaff|language=English, Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval lore===

''Master of the Mysteries: The Life of Manly Palmer Hall''.  Port Townsend, Washington: Process Media, 2008, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century occult work by [[Manly Palmer Hall|Manly P. Hall]], ''Secret Teachings of All Ages'', in which it is attributed to [[Paracelsus]].&lt;ref&gt;Manly P. Hall, ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages:
An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy,'' (original publisher unclear-see [http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/] for on-line text), (1928).&lt;/ref&gt; This illustration appears to originate in a 1527 anti-papal tract by [[Andreas Osiander]] and [[Hans Sachs]], where it is identified as "the Pope as a monster".&lt;ref&gt;Renate Freitag-Stadler and Erhard Schön, ''Die Welt des Hans Sachs,'' City History Museum of Nuremberg, 1976, p. 24 (Kat. 25/15)&lt;/ref&gt; Its association with Paracelsus derives from his ''Auslegung der Magischen Figuren im Carthäuser Kloster zu Nũrnberg''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Hohenheim (Paracelsus)|first=Theophrastus|title=Bücher und Schriften: Adiunctus est Index rerum et verborum accuratiß. Et copiosissimus|date=1603|page=375|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=qSlAAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PT187&amp;pg=RA1-PT194#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 March 2014|chapter=Ein Auslegung der Figuren So Zu Nürnberg Gefunden Sind Worden}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author presents explanations of some illustrations found in a Carthusian monastery in Nuremberg; the illustration in question he labels as "a salamander or desolate worm with a human head and crowned with a crown and a pope hat thereon,"&lt;ref&gt;"ein Salamander oder ein wüster Wurm/Mit einem Menschen Kopff/unnd gekrönet mit einer Kron/unnd ein Bapst Hut darinn"&lt;/ref&gt; which is later explained to represent the Pope. Catholic Archbishop Raymund Netzhammer (1862–1945) explained that the set of woodcuts it belongs to was commissioned by Osiander based on some old "pope illustrations" found at the monastery, which Netzhammer thought may have dated back to the time of [[Joachim of Fiore]] (d. 1202) and were intended as cartoons mocking the Pope and the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Netzhammer|first=Raymund|title=Theophrastus Paracelsus: das wissenswerteste über leben, lehre und schriften des berühmten Einsiedler arztes|date=1900|publisher=Benziger|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aP0sAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA4&amp;pg=RA1-PA4#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptions of the legendary form are more likely to use stylized depictions. In Medieval European bestiaries, fanciful depictions of salamanders include "a satyr-like creature in a circular wooden tub" (8th century), "a worm penetrating flames" (12th century), "a winged dog" (13th century), and "a small bird in flames" (13th century).&lt;ref&gt;Florence McCulloch, ''Medieval Latin and French Bestiaries'' Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1962, pp.161–162&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Renaissance lore: Europe===
[[File:Salamander cartouche of Francois 1 at Azay-le-Rideau.jpg|thumb|Salamander as the animal emblem of King [[Francis I of France]] at the [[Château d'Azay-le-Rideau]], Vienne, France]]

Compared to Medieval depictions, [[Renaissance]] depictions&lt;ref name="prod"&gt;[http://www.propheties.it/nostradamus/prodigiorum/prodigiorum1.html Conrad Lycosthenes, ''Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon,'' 1557] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418105012/http://www.propheties.it/nostradamus/prodigiorum/prodigiorum1.html |date=2007-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are characteristically more realistic, adhering more closely to the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] description. In another example, a 1556 edition of the ''Book of Lambspring'' depicts the salamander as a white bird,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Book of Lambspring|url=http://www.compendiumnaturalis.net/the-book-of-lambspring-1556/|website=Compendium Naturalis|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Lucas Jennis]]' 1625 version of the same illustration, included in the ''[[Musaeum Hermeticum]]'', depicts it as a lizard-like animal with star-like markings (see right).

Of all the traits ascribed to salamanders, the ones relating to fire have stood out most prominently. This connection probably originates from a behavior common to many species of salamander: hibernating in and under rotting logs. When wood was brought indoors and put on the fire, the creatures "mysteriously" appeared from the flames. The 16th-century Italian artist [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571) famously recalled witnessing just such an appearance as a child in his autobiography.&lt;ref name="bullfinch"&gt;[[Thomas Bulfinch]] (1913). ''Age of Fable: Vols. I &amp; II: Stories of Gods and Heroes'': [http://www.bartleby.com/181/365.html XXXVI. e. The Salamander]&lt;/ref&gt; According to some writers, the milky substance that a salamander exudes when frightened and which makes its skin moist gave rise to the idea that the salamander could withstand any heat and even put out fires.&lt;ref name="bullfinch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="friar"&gt;{{cite book | author=Friar, Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Friar |title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry |year=1987 |pages= 300 |publisher=Alphabooks/[[A &amp; C Black]]
|location=London |isbn=978-0-906670-44-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another idea which is found in several Medieval and Renaissance works was that "Egyptian priests" used a [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]] which applied the figure of a salamander to represent a man who is burnt, or in other versions a man who has died from cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hieroglyphes.over-blog.com/article-33035010.html |title=Question : Salamandre et hiéroglyphes ? |author=Eric Desrentes |work=hieroglyphes.over-blog.com/ |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=2 September 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is first found in the ''Hieroglyphica'' of [[Horapollo]] (Book 2, Ch. LXII), but it is not now considered to be an authentic representation of hieroglyphic usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Browne|first=Thomas|title=Pseudodoxia Epidemica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo314.html#note1|accessdate=1 March 2014|author2=James Eason |page=314 (note 1)|date=1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early commentators in Europe often grouped "crawling things" (''reptiles'' or ''reptilia'' in Latin) together, and thus creatures in this group, which typically included salamanders (Latin ''salamandrae''), [[European dragon|dragons]] (Latin ''dracones'' or ''serpentes''), and [[basilisk]]s (Latin ''basilisci''), were often associated, as in Conrad Lycosthenes' ''Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon'' of 1557.&lt;ref name="prod"/&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) wrote the following on the salamander: ''"This has no digestive organs, and gets no food but from the fire, in which it constantly renews its scaly skin. The salamander, which renews its scaly skin in the fire,—for virtue."''&lt;ref&gt;''Book XX: Humorous Writings'', ''The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci'', edited by Jean Paul Richter, 1880. ([http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Richter-NotebooksOfLeonardo/section-20/item-1236.html online]) (unconfirmed)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541) suggested that the salamander was the [[elemental]] of [[fire (classical element)|fire]],&lt;ref name=Paracelsus&gt;Theophrast von Hohenheim a.k.a. Paracelsus, ''Sämtliche Werke: Abt. 1, v. 14, sec. 7, Liber de nymphis, sylphis, pygmaeis et salamandris et de caeteris spiritibus.'' [[Karl Sudhoff]] and Wilh. Matthießen, eds. Munich:Oldenbourg, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; which has had substantial influence on the role of salamanders in the occult. Paracelsus, contrary to the prevalent view of the time, considered them to be not devils but similar to humans — only lacking souls (along with giants, dwarves, mermaids, elves, and elemental spirits in human form).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Treatises of Theophrastus Von Hohenheim Called Paracelsus |date=1941 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |page=221 ff |author=Paracelsus |editor1=Sigerist, H.E |editor2=Temkin, C.L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis I of France]] used the salamander as his symbol.

The salamander is found throughout French folklore, although in differing form. In addition or sometimes instead of its fire symbolism, it was attributed a powerful poison. Some legends say that merely by falling into a well, it would poison the water, and by climbing a fruit tree, poison the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Les animaux du Moyen Âge réels et mythiques | publisher = Autres temps | author = Josy Marty-Dufaut| year = 2005 | isbn = 978-2845211650|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its highly toxic breath was reportedly enough to swell a person until their skin broke; in [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], it supposedly did the same to herds of cattle. This gained it the name of "bellows breath". Like the real animal, the legendary salamander breathed seldom; unlike the real salamander, the only way to kill one was said to be to lock it in a confined space so that it breathed its own poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Brasey, Édouard |  title=La Petite Encyclopédie du merveilleux| publisher=[[Éditions le pré aux clercs]] | place=Paris | date =14 September 2007 | pages=161–162| isbn=978-2842283216|  title-link=La Petite Encyclopédie du merveilleux}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bretons feared it so they did not dare say its real name for fear it would hear and then kill them.

===Renaissance: Asian garments===
Early travelers to [[China]] were shown garments supposedly woven from salamander hair or wool; the cloth was completely unharmed by fire. The garments had actually been [[weaving|woven]] from [[asbestos]].&lt;ref name="bullfinch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clare Browne, "Salamander's Wool: The Historical Evidence for Textiles Woven with Asbestos Fibre", ''[[Textile History]]'', Volume 34, Number 1, May 2003, pp. 64–73(10) [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/tex/2003/00000034/00000001/art00008 (abstract)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to T. H. White, [[Prester John]] had a robe made from it; the "Emperor of India" possessed a suit made from a thousand skins; and [[Pope Alexander III]] had a tunic which he valued highly.&lt;ref name="white" /&gt; [[William Caxton]] (1481) wrote: ''"This Salemandre berithe wulle, of which is made cloth and gyrdles that may not brenne in the fyre."''&lt;ref name="white" /&gt; 
Holme (1688) wrote: ''"...I have several times put [salamander hair] in the Fire and made it red hot and after taken it out, which being cold, yet remained perfect wool."''&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;&lt;ref name="friar"/&gt;

An alternative interpretation was that this material was a kind of [[silk]]: A 12th-century letter supposedly from Prester John says, ''"Our realm yields the worm known as the salamander. Salamanders live in fire and make [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoons]], which our court ladies spin and use to weave cloth and garments. To wash and clean these fabrics, they throw them into flames."''&lt;ref name="borges"&gt;{{cite book | author=Borges, Jorge Luis

|year=1969|origyear= 1967; English language edition 1969 | page= |title-link=The Book of Imaginary Beings }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friar also notes that [[Marco Polo]] believed that the "true" salamander was an incombustible substance found in the earth.&lt;ref name="friar" /&gt;

==Newts in witchcraft==
A [[newt]] is a type of salamander, and they are traditionally associated with [[witchcraft]]. In [[William Shakespeare]]'s famous play ''[[Macbeth]]'', the [[Three Witches|witches]] use the "eye of newt" as the first ingredient stirred in their [[cauldron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eye of Newt and Toe of Frog, Adder's Fork and Lizard's Leg: The Lore and Mythology of Amphibians and Reptiles|last=Crump|first=Marty|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9780226116006|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENYpCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the famous line in ''Macbeth'' is actually referring to a series of plants. Eye of newt refers to mustard, which reiterates the link between salamanders and fire as mustard seeds are used as a "fiery" spice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.howstuffworks.com/is-eye-of-newt-real-thing.htm|title=Is eye of newt a real thing?|author=|date=13 July 2015|website=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''St. Louis Southwestern Railway (Cotton Belt Route) Relief Train''' is a railroad rescue and recovery train, its elements now on display at the [[Arkansas Railroad Museum]] in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]].  The train's principal feature is a large steam crane (SSW 96005), built by [[Industrial Brownhoist]] of [[Bay City, Michigan]] in 1940.  Other elements of the train include a boom car, generator flat, kitchen car, tool car, and crew sleeper.  The boom car, a low gondola car, was attached to the train below the projecting section of the train; the other elements of the train supported the crew and the operation of the crane to clear derailments.  The relief train was assembled by the [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway]] (aka the Cotton Belt Run), and remained in active service until 1996, when it was given to the museum.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/National-Register-Listings/PDF/JE0687.nr.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for St. Louis Southwestern Railway (Cotton Belt Route) Relief Train|publisher=Arkansas Preservation|accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The train was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

{{distinguish|Succubous}}
[[File:Succubus bracket 02.jpg|thumb|right|A 16th-century sculpture representing a succubus, Cambridge.]]
A '''succubus''' is a [[demon]] in female form, or supernatural entity in [[folklore]] (traced back to medieval legend), that appears in dreams and takes the form of a woman in order to [[Seduction|seduce]] men, usually through [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. The male counterpart is the [[incubus]]. Religious traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with a succubus may result in the deterioration of health or mental state, or even death.

In modern representations, a succubus may or may not appear in dreams and is often depicted as a highly attractive seductress or [[Magician (paranormal)|enchantress]]; whereas, in the past, succubi were generally depicted as frightening and demonic.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''succuba'' "paramour"; from ''succubare'' "to lie beneath" (''sub-'' "under" and ''cubare'' "to lie in bed"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/succuba |title= Succuba |publisher=[[dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to describe the sleeper's position to the supernatural being as well. The word "succubus" originates from the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=succubus |title= Succubus |publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary |first= Douglas |last= Harper |authorlink= Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In folklore==
According to [[Zohar]] and the [[Alphabet of Ben Sira]], [[Lilith]] was [[Adam]]'s first wife, who later became a succubus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishchristianlit.com/Topics/Lilith/alphabet.html|title=The Story Of Lilith|publisher=jewishchristianlit.com|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source |sure=y |date=April 2018 |reason=Succubus not mentioned}} She left Adam and refused to return to the [[Garden of Eden]] after she mated with [[archangel]] [[Samael]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://istina.rin.ru/eng/ufo/text/663.html|title=Samael &amp; Lilith|publisher=istina.rin.ru|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zohar]]istic [[Kabbalah]], there were four succubi who mated with the archangel Samael. There were four original queens of the demons: Lilith, [[Eisheth]], [[Agrat bat Mahlat]], and [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/zdm/zdm041.htm |title= Zohar: Chapter XXXII}}&lt;/ref&gt; A succubus may take a form of a beautiful young girl but closer inspection may reveal deformities of her body, such as bird-like claws or [[Serpentine shape|serpentine]] tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Jane P.|title=Early modern supernatural : the dark side of European culture, 1400-1700|year=2012|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780313393433|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folklore also describes the act of [[Sexual penetration|sexually penetrating]] a succubus as akin to entering a cavern of ice, and there are reports of succubi forcing men to perform [[cunnilingus]] on their vulvas that drip with urine and other fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guiley|first=Rosemary Ellen|title=The encyclopedia of witches, witchcraft and wicca|year=2008|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=9781438126845|pages=95|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later folklore, a succubus took the form of a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]].

Throughout history, [[priest]]s and [[rabbi]]s, including [[Hanina Ben Dosa]] and [[Abaye]], tried to curb the power of succubi over humans.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey W. Dennis, The encyclopedia of Jewish myth, magic and mysticism. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all succubi were malevolent. According to [[Walter Mapes|Walter Map]]  in the satire ''[[De Nugis Curialium]]'' (''Trifles of Courtiers''), [[Pope Sylvester II]] (999–1003) was allegedly involved with a succubus named Meridiana, who helped him achieve his high rank in the [[Catholic Church]]. Before his death, he confessed of his sins and died repentant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040717001332/http://www.cyodine.com/succubus/History.htm History of the Succubus] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Ability to reproduce==
According to the [[Kabbalah]] and the school of [[Shlomo ben Aderet|Rashba]], the original three queens of the demons, [[Agrat Bat Mahlat]], [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]], [[Eisheth Zenunim]], and all their cohorts give birth to children, except [[Lilith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lilithgallery.com/library/lilith/Queen-of-the-Demons.html|title=Kabbala: Lilith, Queen of the Demons|author=Alan Humm|publisher=lilithgallery.com|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other [[legend]]s, the children of Lilith are called [[Lilin]].

According to the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', or "Witches' Hammer", written by [[Heinrich Kramer]] (Institoris) in 1486, succubi [[semen collection|collect semen]] from men they seduce. Incubi, or male demons, then use the semen to impregnate human females,&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Heinrich and Sprenger, James (1486), Summers, Montague (translator&amp;nbsp;– 1928), ''The Malleus Maleficarum'', Part2, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/mm02b08a.htm Chapter VIII], "Certain Remedies prescribed against those Dark and Horrid Harms with which Devils may Afflict Men," at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; thus explaining how demons could apparently sire children despite the traditional belief that they were incapable of reproduction. Children so begotten&amp;nbsp;– [[cambion]]s&amp;nbsp;– were supposed to be those that were born deformed, or more susceptible to supernatural influences.&lt;ref name = "AZ"&gt;Lewis, James R., Oliver, Evelyn Dorothy, Sisung Kelle S. (Editor) (1996), ''Angels A to Z'', Entry: Incubi and Succubi, pp. 218, 219, Visible Ink Press, {{ISBN|0-7876-0652-9}}, Till date, most Africa belief has it that men that have similar experience with such principality (succubus) in dreams (usually in form of a pretty lady) find themselves exhausted as soon as they wake up, and often ascribing [[spiritual attack]] to them. Again, rituals/divination are often resorted to with a view to appeasing the god for divine protection and intervention, while the christian folks direct their intervention to God through either fasting and prayer or going for anointing and deliverance (I.E. Bello)&lt;/ref&gt; While the book does not address why a human female impregnated with the semen of a human male would not produce regular human offspring, an explanation could be that the semen is altered before being transferred to the female host. However in some lore, the child is born deformed because the conception was unnatural.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[James VI and I|King James]] in his dissertation titled [[Daemonologie|Dæmonologie]] refutes the possibility for angelic entities to reproduce and instead offered a suggestion that a [[devil]] would carry out two methods of impregnating women: the first, to steal the sperm out of a dead man and deliver it into a woman. If a demon could extract the semen quickly, the transportation of the substance could not be instantly transported to a female host, causing it to go cold. This explains his view that succubae and incubi were the same demonic entity only to be described differently based on the tormented sexes being conversed with. The second method was the idea that a dead body could be possessed by a devil, causing it to rise and have sexual relations with others. However, there is no mention of a female corpse being possessed to elicit sex from men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=Brett|title=The Annotated Dæmonologie of King James. A Critical Edition. In Modern English|date=2016|isbn=978-1-5329-6891-4|pages=79–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qarinah==
In [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|Arabian mythology]], the ''qarînah'' ({{lang|ar|قرينة}}) is a spirit similar to the succubus, with origins possibly in [[ancient Egyptian religion]] or in the [[animism|animistic]] beliefs of [[pre-Islamic Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Zwemer"&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.answering-islam.org/Books/Zwemer/Studies/chap5.htm |first= Samuel M. |last= Zwemer |authorlink= Samuel Marinus Zwemer |title= Studies in Popular Islam: Collection of Papers dealing with the Superstitions and Beliefs of the Common People |location= London |publisher= Sheldon Press |year= 1939 |chapter= 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A qarînah "sleeps with the person and has relations during sleep as is known by the dreams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= A. J. N. |last= Tremearne |title= Ban of the Bori: Demons and Demon-Dancing in West and North Africa }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to be invisible, but a person with "[[second sight]]" can see them, often in the form of a cat, dog, or other household pet.&lt;ref name="Zwemer" /&gt; "In Omdurman it is a spirit which possesses. ... Only certain people are possessed and such people cannot marry or the qarina will harm them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= J. Spencer |last= Trimingham |authorlink= J. Spencer Trimingham |title= Islam in the Sudan |location= London |publisher= Frank Cass &amp; Co. Ltd. |year= 1965 |page= 172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, many African myths claim{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} that men who have similar experience with such principality (succubus) in dreams (usually in form of a beautiful woman) find themselves exhausted as soon as they awaken; often claiming spiritual attack upon them. Local rituals/divination are often invoked in order to appeal the god for divine protection and intervention.

==Scientific explanations==
In the field of [[medicine]], there is some belief that the stories relating to encounters with succubi bear resemblance to the contemporary phenomenon of people reporting [[alien abduction]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight-Jadczyk|first=Laura|title=The high strangeness of dimensions, densities, and the process of alien abduction|year=2005|location=[S.l.] : Red Pill Press|isbn=9781897244111|pages=92|author2=Henri Sy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been ascribed to the condition known as [[sleep paralysis]]. It is therefore suggested that historical accounts of people experiencing encounters with succubi may rather have been symptoms of sleep paralysis, with the hallucination of the said creatures coming from their contemporary culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepdic.com/sleepparalysis.html |title= Sleep Paralysis|publisher = The Skeptics Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trionica.com/asp/phenomena/index.htm |title= Phenomena of Awareness during Sleep Paralysis|publisher = Trionic Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
{{main article|Succubi in fiction}}
Throughout history, succubi have been popular characters in music, literature, film, television, and especially as video game and manga/anime characters.

The original idea for the walk-through heart exhibit came from Dr. Mildred Pfeiffer, a physician and Director of Cardiovascular Diseases at the [[Pennsylvania Department of Health]] who would travel giving lectures about the heart and heart health, proposed the idea of the heart in an effort to have a centralized resource that people could visit and learn of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1992-06-25/news/26029552_1_human-heart-episcopal-hospital-diseases|title=Human Heart Episcopal Hospital Diseases|website=articles.philly.com|access-date=2018-11-29}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-02-12/news/26177445_1_human-heart-lub-dub-franklin-institute|title=Heartthrob Of Museum Beats Cleanly Once Again|website=philly-archives|access-date=2016-03-02}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original materials used to construct the heart were [[papier-mâché]], [[chicken wire]] and lumber.

The Giant Heart was supposed to have only been on display for six months, but now over 50 years later, it remains one of the most visited exhibits at The Franklin Institute

== Renovation ==
The Giant Heart and its accompanying exhibit, Bio-science Exhibit, have since been remodeled and updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fi.edu/exhibit/giant-heart|title=The Giant Heart {{!}} The Franklin Institute Science Museum|website=www.fi.edu|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bio-science exhibit as a whole carries on the tradition of teaching and sparking interest in the science of the human body.

They consider themselves as [[nationalist]], [[socialist]] and [[Kemalist]]. They often promote Nationalism, Socialism and Secularism. However, unlike other Socialists, they criticise Marx often and they consider [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] and [[Sultan Galiev]] as ideologues of Turkic Socialism. They are influenced by [[Attila İlhan]], [[Doğan Avcıoğlu]] and [[Şevket Süreyya Aydemir]] also. They have been in favour of [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Kim Jong Il]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Hugo Chavez]] because of their Socialism and Third Worldism, [[Rauf Denktaş]] and [[Rebiya Kadeer]] because of their Pan-Turkism.

They support good relations with Turkic and Islamic countries and they view [[the USA]], [[Israel]], [[European Union|EU]], [[Russia]] and [[China]] as enemies of Turkey.

They are often criticised for their views on Kurds. Especially their "Kurdish Invasion in Turkish Cities" theory is famous. They defend themselves with saying that Turkey is a nation-state and even saying "I'm Kurd" is separatism. They defend it with Nation definition of Turkish constitution. According to it, "every citizen of Turkey is Turkish, regardless of ethnic group, race and religion."
Türksolu defends that Kurds should melt in Turkish pot.

Unlike most of Kemalists, they also admire Ottomans and defend its legacy except 19th-century Ottomans. They see [[Osman I]] and Atatürk as similar leaders, who both created new states instead serving a defeated, perished state. Despite they also appropriate [[Mehmed II]], [[Selim I]] and [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], they see [[Mahmud II]], [[Abdulhamid II]] and [[Mehmed VI]] as traitors, they have a similar view of other last era Ottoman sultans.

The group publishes ''Türksolu'' and ''İleri'' and founded a  political party called [[National Party (Turkey)|Ulusal Parti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ataturkcuparti.org/|title=Atatürkçü Parti Geliyor!|work=Atatürkçü Parti|accessdate=13 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304232816/http://www.ataturkcuparti.org/|archivedate=4 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.turksolu.org/269/basyazi269.htm|title=Gökçe Fırat Atatürkçü Parti'ye çağırıyor|newspaper=TÜRKSOLU Gazetesi|accessdate=13 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019002914/http://turksolu.org/269/basyazi269.htm|archivedate=19 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulusalparti.net/|title=Ulusal Parti|publisher=Ulusal Parti|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uttering''' is a [[crime]] involving a person with the intent to defraud that knowingly sells, publishes or passes a [[forgery|forged]] or [[counterfeit]]ed document.  More specifically, forgery creates a falsified document and uttering is the act of knowingly passing on or using the forged document.

==Background==

In the law of countries whose legal systems derive from [[English common law]], uttering is a [[crime]] similar to [[forgery]].  Uttering and forgery were originally [[common law]] offences, both [[misdemeanour]]s.  Forgery was the creation of a forged document, with the intent to defraud; whereas uttering was merely use &amp;mdash; the ''passing'' &amp;mdash; of a forged document, that someone else had made, with the intent to defraud.  In law, uttering is synonymous with publication, and the distinction made between the common law offences was that forgery was the ''fabrication'' of a forged instrument (with the intent to defraud) and uttering was the ''publication'' of that instrument (with the intent to defraud).  Statute law offences of forgery replace the common law offences nowadays, often subsuming the offence of uttering, and forgery is usually a [[felony]] rather than a misdemeanour.{{sfn|Carlan|Nored|Downey|2010|p=45&amp;ndash;47}}{{sfn|Scheb|2008|p=181}}

==Canada==
''Uttering a [[Forgery|forged]] [[document]]'' is a criminal offence in [[Canada]], contrary to s 368 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]. It is an [[indictable offence]] and is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-189.html#h-102 ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 368.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

===England and Wales and Northern Ireland===
See section 36 of the [[Forgery Act 1861]].

'''History'''

See section 6 of the [[Forgery Act 1913]].

Section 29(1)(i) of the [[Larceny Act 1916]] formerly created the offence of uttering a letter or writing demanding property with menaces.

===Scotland===
In Scotland ''Uttering forged writings'' is a crime defined as "using as genuine a fabricated writing falsely intended to pass as genuine the writing of another person".{{sfn|NAS|2006|loc="Uttering"}}

==United States==
In the U.S., uttering is the act of offering a forged document to another when the offeror has knowledge that the document is forged.&lt;ref name=SvG/&gt;  Uttering does not require that the person who presented the document actually forged or altered the document. For example, forging a log for personal profit might be considered uttering and publishing. Another example would be the forging of a [[Diploma|university diploma]].  As an example of the law itself, the [[State of Michigan]] defines the offense (MCL 750.249): "Any person who utters and publishes as true any false, forged, altered or counterfeit record, [[deed]], instrument or other writing specified, knowing it to be false, altered, forged, or counterfeit, with intent to injure or [[fraud|defraud]] is guilty of uttering and publishing."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030919220237/http://courtofappeals.mijud.net/Digest/newHTML/24796721.htm People v Cassadime - Michigan Appellate Digest, 9 September 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forging or illegal "publishing" of an official or unofficial document is not the essence of uttering. Uttering is the actual presentation of forged or official documentation as one's own.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9292">The '''Yale Film Study Center''' is a film archive located in the [http://whc.yale.edu Whitney Humanities Center] at [[Yale University]], and is part of the [[Yale University Library]]. The film collection consists of more than 5,000 35mm, 16mm, 8mm, and Super 8mm prints and the video collection includes more than 35,000 items on DVD, Blu-ray, LaserDisc, and VHS. The Film Study Center engages in the conservation, preservation, presentation, and circulation of moving image materials. The Film Study Center is an Associate of the [[International Federation of Film Archives]].

Founded in 1982, the Film Study Center archive traces its roots to film collections at Yale dating back to the 1960s, including the historic archives of a number of prominent film collectors. The FSC is currently involved in efforts to preserve film on film and to share its collection through public screenings, to ensure that films can continue to be presented as they were originally seen by audiences.

The film collection of the Film Study Center is made up of a wide range of holdings, from Hollywood features to experimental shorts, from home movies to Bollywood musicals. The collection spans more than 120 years of cinema history, and includes films from around the globe as well as a number of films made by Yale alumni and about Yale and New Haven.

Researchers can view films on site&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-mesmerizing-marathon-of-robert-franks-movies|title=A Mesmerizing Marathon of Robert Frank’s Movies|date=2016-07-12|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Film Study Center’s two screening rooms, which are capable of showing 16mm film and multiple video formats. One of these rooms is also equipped for screening 3D Blu-rays. The FSC also has two [[Flatbed editor|flatbed]] film viewing stations and twelve private video viewing booths for individual use. The FSC regularly screens its 35mm prints for the public in the Whitney Humanities Center Auditorium, the last 35mm-equipped public venue in New Haven County.

Film Study Center staff regularly consult on special film projects around the University, including the preservation of film material in the [[Benny Goodman]] Collection in the [http://web.library.yale.edu/music Irving Gilmore Music Library] of the [[Yale University Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/royal-restoration-yale-saves-king-swings-lost-home-movies-342247|title=Royal Restoration: Yale Saves King of Swing’s Lost Home Movies|date=2015-06-13|newspaper=Newsweek|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1968, Yale began collecting 16mm film with the purchase of several hundred prints known as the John Griggs Collection of Classic Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.yale.edu/utils/getarticleclippings/collection/yale-ydn/id/23855/articleId/DIVL48/compObjId/23861/lang/en_US/dmtext/|title=Yale Daily News no. 116 April 5 1968: Yale Acquires Collection Of Classic Films  207 Titles, Mostly Silents|website=digital.library.yale.edu|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Griggs films came to Yale largely through the efforts of experimental filmmaker [[Standish Lawder]], then Assistant Professor in Yale’s History of Art Department, and Yale alumnus [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/29/classified/paid-notice-deaths-berger-spencer-merriam.html Spencer Berger], a film collector and historian of the [[Barrymore family]]. The purchase was funded by three alumni: [[Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|Fred W. Beinecke]], [http://www.historylink.org/File/7190 Richard E. Fuller], and [https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/23/archives/chester-j-la-roche-advertising-leader-yale-exquarterback-84-headed.html Chester J. LaRoche Jr.], all graduates of the University. Although modest, this acquisition encouraged other collectors to donate their films, which then became part a vital part of film curricula.

Over the next 15 years, film as an academic discipline grew immensely, leading to the formation of both the [http://filmstudies.yale.edu Film Studies Program] and the Film Study Center in 1982. During the 1980s, the 16mm archive burgeoned with film donations by Yale alumni Spencer Berger, Ralph Hirshorn, and others, while Yale’s 35mm archive was born with hundreds of rare prints of television programs produced by [[Herbert Brodkin]], and collections such as those of the pioneering experimental director [[Mary Ellen Bute]], a 1926 alumna of the [[Yale School of Drama]].

In 2013, the Film Study Center began its monthly screening series "[http://its.yale.edu/centers/film-study-center/events Treasures from the Yale Film Archive]," showcasing 35mm prints from the archive's collection. The screenings feature introductions by Film Study Center staff as well as Yale faculty, and have also included guest filmmakers such as [[Michael Roemer]], [[Warrington Hudlin]], [[Tamar Simon Hoffs]], [[Norman Weissman]], and Frank and Caroline Mouris, as well as musical accompaniment for silent films by [http://silent-film-music.com Donald Sosin].

In July, 2017, the Yale Film Study Center formally became part of the Yale University Library.

== Preservation ==
Films preserved by the Film Study Center include ''Passages from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake'' (directed by Mary Ellen Bute) and ''The Boy Who Saw Through'' (produced by Bute and directed by [[George C. Stoney]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703766704576009590243579406|title=Experiments In Love and Film|last=Bennett|first=Bruce|date=2010-12-10|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;; ''Our Union,'' directed by [[Carl Marzani]]; ''To Be a Man'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/10/10/restored-documentary-portrays-1960s-yale/|title=Restored documentary portrays 1960s Yale|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Murray Lerner]]; and four films by animator [[Frank Mouris]]: ''Quick Dream'', ''You're Not Real Pretty But You're Mine...'', ''Chemical Architecture'', and ''Coney Island Eats''. In 2018, the Film Study Center completed preservation of director Nicholas Doob's 1979 film "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8456570/ Street Music]," which features performances by 19 street musicians including "[https://www.apnews.com/481fe06a0e974e18cec692afed297e87and Oliver "Pork Chop" Anderson]," [[Brother Blue]], [[Bongo Joe Coleman]], [[Maxwell Street Jimmy Davis|Jimmy Davis]], [http://www.westword.com/news/the-show-must-go-on-5059091 Guy Mosley], [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0658007/ Gene Palma], and "[[Grimes Poznikov|The Automatic Human Jukebox]]."

The Film Study Center also preserved 2-inch videotapes containing a 1972 broadcast by [[WFSB|WTIC]] of "What's Happening," a local news program that covered the visit to Yale by [[Duke Ellington]] and other jazz musicians including [[Eubie Blake]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Jo Jones]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Max Roach]], and [[Mary Lou Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nhregister.com/arts-and-entertainment/20160512/the-duke-dizzy-eubie-return-to-yale-in-film-jazz-event-friday|title=The Duke, Dizzy &amp; Eubie return to Yale in film, jazz event Friday|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
