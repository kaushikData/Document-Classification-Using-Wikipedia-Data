'''"Free Albania" National Committee''' ({{lang-sq|Komiteti Kombëtar "Shqipëria e Lirë"}}), also known as '''"Free Albania" National-Democratic Committee''', also '''National Committee for a Free Albania''' or '''NCFA''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/1705143/OBOPUS%20BG%20FIEND%20%20%20VOL.%203%20%28OBLIVIOUS%20%20%20NATIONAL%20COMMITTEE%20FOR%20FREE%20ALBANIA%29_0005.pdf Attachment to OIZA-244, No. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; was a political organization of post-[[World War II]] [[Albania]]n emigre in the Western countries.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt; It was supported by [[CIA]], placed as member of [[National Committee for a Free Europe]].&lt;ref name="TO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="panorama"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herken"/&gt; The committee aimed organizing the Albanian diaspora and cooperating with western powers into overthrown [[Enver Hoxha]]'s [[Communism in Albania|Communist regime in Albania]].&lt;ref name="Herken"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KHKBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143&amp;dq=national+committee+for+a+free+albania&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCGoVChMI99CCiIazyAIVCcOACh1Xyg4g#v=onepage&amp;q=national%20committee%20for%20a%20free%20albania&amp;f=false|title=The Georgetown Set: Friends and Rivals in Cold War Washington| author=Gregg Herken|publisher=Alfred A.

&lt;br&gt;The committee creation started in [[Rome]] and was finalized in [[Paris]] in the summer of 1949.

==Background==
With the triumph of Communism in Albania, many of the political factors of Albania during World War II had to flee the country. Many of them collaborated with the western government and secret services into overthrowing the communists, and changing the form of the regime in Albania. The base for the committee was heterogeneous, the most known actors were former [[Balli Kombëtar]] members including [[Mithat Frashëri]], [[Abas Ermenji]], [[Vasil Andoni]], [[Hafëz Jusuf Azemi]], [[Ali Klissura]], etc., [[Legaliteti]] members with its leader [[Abaz Kupi]], "Blloku Indipendent" (Independent Block) of  pro-Italian and/or [[collaborationist]] elements that were involved with Albanian puppet governments during the war, i.e. [[Ernest Koliqi]], [[Mustafa Kruja]], [[Gjon Marka Gjoni]], [[Shefqet Verlaci]], anti-fascist and anti-communist guerrillas who cooperated with British-American emissaries during the war led by [[Said bey Kryeziu]], other independent anti-communists, i.e. [[Muharrem Bajraktari]], as well as other political fractions like "Peasant League" ({{lang-sq|Lidhja Katundare}}), etc.

==Creation==
The preparation started in Rome in 1948, with the initiative of Legaliteti. After the rejection of Balli Kombëtar (due to political antagonism inherited since World War II), Balli's leader Mithat Frashëri resumed the initiative again. This time strong confrontations happened between Balli members and "Blloku Indipendent" which definitely stayed out of the committee.&lt;ref name="sot"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sot.com.al/dossier/fitorja-e-pksh-n%C3%AB-vitin-1944-detyroi-1100-ballist%C3%AB-e-legalist%C3%AB-t%E2%80%99ia-%E2%80%9Cmbathin%E2%80%9D-n%C3%AB-itali-450|language=Albanian |publisher=Sot News|accessdate=2014-12-19|date=2013-04-17|title=Fitorja e PKSH në vitin 1944 detyroi 1100 ballistë e legalistë t’ia "mbathin" në Itali, 450 të tjerë në Greqi|trans-title=Victory of PKSH in 1944 forced 1100 Balli and Legaliteti members to flee to Italy, other 450 to Greece|author=Përparim Halili}}&lt;/ref&gt; State Department did not want any of the Blloku members involved in the committee due to their pro Italian/German stance during the war, but there was a silent voucher for guerillas like Ismail Vërlaci of Gjon Markagjoni who could join as individuals and not as representatives of Blloku.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXvoBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP90&amp;dq=national+committee+for+a+free+albania&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwA2oVChMI99CCiIazyAIVCcOACh1Xyg4g#v=onepage&amp;q=national%20committee%20for%20a%20free%20albania&amp;f=false| author=Albert Lulushi|title=Operation Valuable Fiend : the CIA's first paramilitary strike against the Iron Curtain| publisher=Arcade Publishing| year=2004|isbn=9781628723229 |oclc=876900674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inaugural storefront office was opened in Paris, 1 July 1949.&lt;ref name="Herken"/&gt; Free Albania" National Committee was officially constituted on July 7&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt; (although some Albanian sources place it later in time, on 26 August 1949&lt;ref name="Mustaqi"/&gt;). Mithat Frashëri was its chairman, with other members of the Directing Board: Nuçi Kotta (son of the Albanian former Prime Minister [[Kostaq Kotta]]), Abaz Kupi, Said Kryeziu, and Zef Pali.&lt;ref name="Mustaqi"/&gt; There was also a national committee consisted of Eqrem Telhai of "Peasant League" (Albanian: ''Lidhja Katundare''), Hysni Mulleti of "Agrarian League" (Albanian: ''Lidhja Agrare''), Muharrem Bajraktari as "Independent Fighting Group" (Albanian: ''Grupi Luftëtar i Pavarur''), Ihsan Toptani - independent, Gaqo Gogo, a pro-monarchist and former [[King Zog I]]'s secretary, Myftar Spahiu and Gani Tafilaj from Legaliteti, whilst Halil Maçi, Vasil Andoni, and Abaz Ermenji from Balli Kombëtar.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Gaqo Gogo served also as Executive Secretary, while Abaz Kupi was appointed chairman of the [[military junta]], with Ermenji and Kryeziu as his deputies.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{citation| pages=349–350| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D4wx7kQp4bgC&amp;pg=PA349&amp;lpg=PA349&amp;dq=zef+pali&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2f9OIOigOj&amp;sig=hCps-WhxD1FJVf6pXqdub7nu6XA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMI8Y-KqZ-yyAIVRCseCh0xggHb#v=onepage&amp;q=zef%20pali&amp;f=false| author=Owen Pearson| title=Albania in the Twentieth Century, A History| volume=III|publisher=Centre for Albanian Studies in association with I.B. Tauris| year=2006|isbn=9781845110161 |oclc=72140383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 1949, the committee proclaimed itself in a [[BBC]] radio transmission. In the following days, Mithat Frashëri would organize a press-conference, which rose another conflict with pro-[[Yugoslavia]]n [[UK|British authorities]], opposing Frashëri's words which included "[[Kosovo]]", stating that he should speak only regarding territories subject to Albanian state.

Soon-after, the British intelligence officer [[Neil McLean (politician)|Billy McLean]] together with Alan Hare and Harold Perkins flew to [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] where they joined [[Julian Amery]] and Robert Low. They had a meeting with King Zog trying to persuade him to recognize the committee. Former King of Albania, [[Ahmet Zogu]], opposed the committee even though his supporter Abaz Kupi was one of the founders, with the explanation that he was the only legitimate representative of Albania.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustaqi"&gt;{{citation |url=http://gazeta-lajmi.info/1949-pentagoni-diplomaci-fleksibel-me-shqiperine/ |author=Thanas Mustaqi |language=Albanian |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2014-12-19 |title=1949, Pentagoni: Diplomaci fleksibël me Shqipërinë |trans-title=1949, Pentagon:Flexible diplomacy with Albania |quote=Më 26 gusht të vitit 1949, në Paris u formua Komiteti Kombëtar-Demokratik "Shqipëria e lirë", me nismën e Mithat Frashërit për të "udhëhequr dhe inkurajuar njerëzit tanë të zotë në rezistencën e tyre kundër tiranisë komuniste". Këtu u zgjodh edhe Këshilli udhëheqës i saj i përbërë nga Mid’hat Frashëri (kryetar), Abas Kupi, Zef Pali, Said Kryeziu dhe Nuçi Kotta (anëtarë). Organi më i lartë ishte Këshilli Kombëtar prej 11 anëtarësh nga parti të ndryshme. Por pas disa ditësh, agjencia franceze e lajmeve AFP transmetoi një deklaratë të Mbretit në mërgim Ahmet Zogu, në të cilën thuhej se nuk e njihte Komitetin Shqipëria e Lirë dhe se "pas 7 prillit 1939, unë jam i vetmi autoritet legjitim i shqiptarëve". |publisher=Lajmi |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6V0p7439H?url=http://gazeta-lajmi.info/1949-pentagoni-diplomaci-fleksibel-me-shqiperine/ |archivedate=2014-12-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee published the biweekly journal "Shqiperia" (Albania) in [[Albanian language]].&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

==Post 1949==
The committee was restructured with its center in [[New York City]]. After Frashëri's death in October 1949, [[Hasan Dosti]] took over,&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;[http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/1705143/OBOPUS%20BGFIEND%20%20%20VOL.%208_0028.pdf CIA released documents]&lt;/ref&gt; but later [[Rexhep Krasniqi]],&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{citation|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|page=144|series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe|volume=75|edition=2|isbn=978-0810861886 |publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Kosovar Albanians|Kosovar Albanian]] became chairman with support of [[Xhafer Deva]] who had previously settled in US.&lt;ref name="TO"/&gt;
[[Abas Ermenji]] continued to work in France, where he published the journal "Qëndresa Shqiptare" ({{lang-sq|Albanian Resistance}}).

The committee collaborated with CIA into forming the [[Company 4000]] military units, stationed in [[Hohenbrunn]], [[Bavaria]], [[West Germany]] in 1950. The "company" consisted of trained military units, supporting the [[Albanian Subversion]], though it was never effective.&lt;ref name="TO"&gt;{{citation |language=Albanian |publisher=Tirana Observer |accessdate=2014-12-19 |url=http://www.tiranaobserver.al/deshmia-e-neshat-bilalit-pse-kompania-4000-deshtoi-ne-rrezimin-e-enver-hoxhes/ |author=Petrit Palushi |title=Dëshmia e Neshat Bilalit: Pse "Kompania 4000" dështoi në rrëzimin e Enver Hoxhës |trans-title=Testimony of Neshat Bilali: Why Company 4000 failed in overthrowing Enver Hoxha |date=2014-03-12 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6V3yKOOUz?url=http://www.tiranaobserver.al/deshmia-e-neshat-bilalit-pse-kompania-4000-deshtoi-ne-rrezimin-e-enver-hoxhes/ |archivedate=2014-12-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Albania joining [[UN]] in 1955, the committee's activities diminished over the years, but it continued to organize political gatherings, conferences, and seminars. Over 15,000 Albanian refugees were resettled in the United States through its efforts. Krasniqi publisher the newspaper "The Free Albanian" ({{lang-sq|Shqiptari i lirë}}) from November 1957 to 1970. It was one of the nine national representations which were used by [[State Department]] to create the [[Assembly of Captive European Nations]] (ACEN).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVjXAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=national+committee+for+a+free+albania&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAWoVChMI99CCiIazyAIVCcOACh1Xyg4g#v=onepage&amp;q=national%20committee%20for%20a%20free%20albania&amp;f=false| author=Katalin Kadar Lynn| page=334| title=The inauguration of organized political warfare : cold war organizations sponsored by the National Committee for a Free Europe/Free Europe Committee|isbn=9780985943318 |oclc=867652489|year=2013|publisher=Helena History Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Fall of Communism in Albania|demise of communism]], the board of directors of the FAC decided that its functions would no longer be needed, and it was disbanded in 1992.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;

==CIA involvement==
Recent(2013) CIA documents becoming public, which found a vast reflection in the Albanian media, showed CIA's deep involvement in committee's creation and activity, as well as the sponsor.&lt;ref name="TO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="panorama"&gt;{{citation |publisher=Gazeta Panorama Online |language=Albanian |accessdate=2014-12-19 |url=http://www.panorama.com.al/2013/06/30/arkivi-i-cia-roma-qendra-e-operacioneve-kunder-hoxhes/ |title=Arkivi i CIA: Roma, qendra e operacioneve kundër Hoxhës |date=2012-06-30 |trans-title=CIA archives: Rome, centre of operations against Hoxha |author=Auron Tare |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6V3ycBly8?url=http://www.panorama.com.al/2013/06/30/arkivi-i-cia-roma-qendra-e-operacioneve-kunder-hoxhes/ |archivedate=2014-12-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pedra da Gavea proche.jpg|350px|right|thumb|Pedra da Gavea, Rio de Janeiro. The "eyes" of the "face" are looking towards the right-hand of this picture. The etchings that can be seen on the dome of the mountain make up the supposed inscription.]]
[[Pedra da Gávea]] is a [[mountain]] in [[Tijuca Forest]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. Differential weathering on one side of the rock has created what is described as a stylized human face. Markings on another face of the rock have been described as an inscription. Some individuals, such as Bernardo de Azevedo da Silva Ramos, have advanced the position that the inscription is of [[Phoenicia]]n origin and possibly proof of pre-Columbian contact from [[Old World]] cultures. Alternative theories proposed include that the rock was the site of a [[Viking]] colony or that it is connected with suspected [[UFO]] activity.

Geologists and scientists are nearly in agreement that the "inscription" is the result of erosion and that the "face" is a product of [[pareidolia]]. No credible evidence has ever been collected that backs up the idea that Pedra da Gávea was discovered by Phoenicians or any other civilization. Furthermore, the [[scientific consensus|consensus]] of archaeologists and scholars in Brazil is that the mountain should not be viewed as an archaeological site, and hypotheses that regard it as such are [[Fringe theory|fringe theories]].

The first row is the inscription ''[[in situ]]'', the second row is a rough rendering of the Phoenician characters, the third is a transliteration into [[Hebrew]], the fourth is a rendering of the letters in the [[Latin alphabet]], and the final line is the supposed message in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name=letters&gt;[[#Ramos|Ramos (1930)]], p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many people throughout the years have believed there to be an inscription carved into the rockface of the mountain.&lt;ref name=her21214/&gt; Reportedly, Christian missionaries were the first to notice these "markings", and they reported their findings to [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], the King of Portugal at the time; his son, [[Pedro I of Brazil]] later looked into these theories.&lt;ref name=rockhard /&gt;&lt;ref name=travelguide&gt;[[#Waggoner|Waggoner (2008)]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul Herrmann in his book ''Conquests by Man'', for many the inscription on the mountain was attributed to "some unknown prehistoric American people" until some began to speculate that the characters were of [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] origin.&lt;ref name=her21214&gt;[[#Herrmann|Herrmann (1954)]], pp. 212{{en dash}}14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, Januário da Cunha Barbosa and Araújo Porto-Alegre, on behalf of the [[Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute]] (IHGB), undertook the first official study of the structure. They later published an article entitled "Relatório Sobre a Inscrição da Gávea" ("The Report on the Inscription of Gávea") in the which they examined the markings more closely.&lt;ref name=thejournal&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barbosa, Januário da Cunha|author2=Porto Alegre, Manuel de Araújo|journal=RIHGB|title=Relatório Sobre a Inscrição da Gávea|publisher=[[Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute]]|year=1839|pages=86–91|url=https://www.ihgb.org.br/pesquisa/hemeroteca/artigos-de-periodicos/item/75584-relat%C3%B3rio-sobre-a-inscri%C3%A7%C3%A3o-da-g%C3%A1vea.html|accessdate=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=portugesebook&gt;[[#Turin|Turin (2005)]], p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbosa and Porto-Alegre argued that there were only two viable hypotheses that could explain the markings: either "the inscription was made by ancient people who landed on the Brazilian coast, or it was the result of mere chance."&lt;ref name=b&amp;a2014&gt;[[#Biagini|Biagini &amp; Antonello (2014)]], p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; If the former were the answer, the two voiced hope that one day a "Brazilian [[Jean-François Champollion|Champollion]]" would be able to decipher the inscription.&lt;ref name=b&amp;a2014/&gt;

In the 1930s, Brazilian archaeologist Bernardo de Azevedo da Silva Ramos studied the mountain, hoping that it could provide evidence for his beliefs that "there existed a pre-Columbian civilization on the American Continent contemporary with the apogee of Phoenician and Greek expansion in the Mediterranean."&lt;ref name=isisreview&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nykl|first=A.R.|title=''Inscripções é Tradições da América Prehistórica Especialmente do Brasil'' by Bernardo De Azevedo Da Silva Ramos|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|date=December 1950|volume=41|issue=3/4|page=318|jstor=227072|doi=10.1086/349215}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramos traveled to Pedra da Gávea, wrote down the markings described by the IHGB, and then with the aid of a [[rabbi]] in [[Manaus]],&lt;ref name=her21214/&gt; he claimed to have "succeeded in deciphering the inscriptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sommer|first=Frederico|title=Stone Inscriptions and Escutcheons|journal=[[American Anthropologist]]|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|date=October–December 1920|volume=22|issue=4|pages=388–389|jstor=660340|doi=10.1525/aa.1920.22.4.02a00140}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the inscription (when read from right to left, the direction that Phoenician is written) is "𐤋𐤀𐤀𐤁𐤇𐤕𐤄𐤉𐤁𐤀𐤓𐤓𐤉𐤆𐤃𐤀𐤁𐤍𐤀𐤉𐤔𐤉𐤍𐤄𐤏𐤅𐤓𐤅𐤆𐤕".&lt;ref name=letters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Phoenician Alphabet and Language|url=http://www.ancient.eu.com/article/17/|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=September 10, 2013|date=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inscription, when reversed and [[transliteration|transliterated]] into the Latin alphabet, is said to read "TZUR FOENISIAN BADZIR RAB JETHBAAL",&lt;ref name=letters /&gt; which is translated roughly as "[[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Phoenicia]], Badezir, Firstborn of Jethbaal".&lt;ref name=her21214/&gt; This is supposedly refers to a ruler of Phoenicia named [[Baal-Eser II|Badezir]]{{#tag:ref|Also written as Badzir, Badezor, Badezorus, Baal-Eser II, and Balbazer II.

Various other people and organizations have attempted to rationalize and verify the inscription. At least one study was undertaken by a [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]] named Irineu Petri to find "the possible relation between the inscription … and the [[Book of Mormon]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glover|Glover (1977)]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Argentinian archaeologist [[Jacques de Mahieu]] argued that the inscription was not Phoenician, but rather Nordic [[runes]], which read: "Next to this rock, numerous oak planks for ship are deposited on the beaches of sand."&lt;ref name=othertheories&gt;{{cite news|last=Buonfiglio|first=Monica|title=Descubra o mistério da Pedra da Gávea|url=http://www.terra.com.br/esoterico/monica/colunas/2007/09/25/001.htm|accessdate=September 12, 2013|newspaper=[[Terra Networks#Terra.com|Terra]]|publisher=[[Terra Networks]]|year=2009|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he argued that [[Vikings]] would have revered the site, as the mountain would have appeared to them as their god [[Odin]].&lt;ref name=othertheories /&gt; The [[International Fortean Organization]] used the 1982 discovery of what were believed to be Phoenician [[amphorae]] in Guanabara Bay by [[Robert F.

In addition to the purported inscription, the "face" of the rock is alleged by some to have been carved around the same time in the likeness of Badezir.&lt;ref name=geobook&gt;[[#Twidale|Twidale (1982)]], p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an issue of ''[[International Fortean Organization|The INFO Journal]]'' speculated as to whether the mountain contains a Phoenician tomb (although there is no scientific evidence to suggest that this is the case).&lt;ref name=tomb /&gt;&lt;ref name=rockhard/&gt;

== Scientific analysis ==
[[File:Alvorada na Pedra da Gávea.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Stone of Gávea at dawn]]
Because Barbosa and Porto-Alegre's research was carried out during the early years of the reign of [[Brazil]]ian Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], Lucia Maria Pascoal Guimarães and Birgitte Holten later postulated that the focus placed on Pedra da Gávea was an attempt by the [[Brazilian Empire]] to [[nation-building|nation-build]] and "establish the 'roots' of [an] ethno-cultural" state anchored in the concept of the [[Old World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guimarães|first=Lucia Maria Paschoal|author2=Holten, Birgitte|title=A Suposta Presença Escandinava na Terra de Santa Cruz e a Ciência|date=April 19, 1997|pages=5–6|url=http://biblioteca.clacso.edu.ar/ar/libros/lasa97/guimholten.pdf|accessdate=September 10, 2013|others=Presented at the Meeting of the Latin American Studies Association|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramos's work in particular was criticized by scientists and scholars. A.R. Nykl wrote that Ramos "adopted wrong principles and consequently arrived at wrong conclusions."&lt;ref name=isisreview /&gt; Furthermore, Nykl wrote that "to look for Phoenician and Greek equivalents in the mysterious petroglyphs … is pure imagination devoid of any solid basis."&lt;ref name=isisreview /&gt; In an article for [[LiveScience]], Kim Ann Zimmermann argued that the belief in the inscriptions and "face" at Pedra da Gávea are example of [[pareidolia]], or the psychological phenomenon involving a vague and random stimulus being perceived as significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmermann|first=Kim Ann|title=Pareidolia: Seeing Faces in Unusual Places|url=http://www.livescience.com/25448-pareidolia.html|publisher=[[LiveScience]]|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most researchers suggest that the inscription and "face" are merely the results of erosion. Barbosa and Porto-Alegre initially concluded that while it was possible that the marks were eroded Phoenician letters, there was also the chance that they were made by natural processes.&lt;ref name=travelguide /&gt;&lt;ref name=thejournal /&gt;&lt;ref name=portugesebook /&gt;&lt;ref name=b&amp;a2014/&gt; T. Cooper Clark, a fellow of both the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]], in his article "The XXth International Congress of Americanists", described an expedition that he took to the site, and claimed that "the lines are only formed by erosion" and that "the very inaccessibility of the spot at once dismisses the idea of such marks being the work of man."&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=T. Cooper|title=The XXth International Congress of Americanists|journal=The Pan-American Magazine and New World Review|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|year=1922|volume=36|pages=286–287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7sWAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=Gavea+Rock+inscription#v=onepage&amp;q=Gavea%20Rock%20inscription&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Geomorphological Landscapes of the World'', it is suggested that the "face" of the structure is the result of [[differential weathering]] at the point where the granite cap of the mountain meets the gneiss layer.&lt;ref name=weathering&gt;[[#Migoń|Migoń (2010)]], p. 94, Fig. 10.5.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2000, a group of geologists travelled to the summit of Pedra da Gávea with equipment to determine whether the mountain possessed any hollow spaces; their results showed that the structure was solid and that there were no internal tunnels or burial tombs. The group also concluded that the "inscriptions" were just vertical grooves that had been worn into the less resistant parts of the stone.&lt;ref name=rockhard&gt;{{cite web|last=Faria|first=Antonio Paulo|title=A Pedra da Gávea|url=http://altamontanha.com/Colunas/1261/a-pedra-da-gavea|accessdate=September 12, 2013|publisher=Alta Montanha|date=March 4, 2009|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1950s, the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Health denied that the site featured any writing, declaring "that examination by geologists had proved it to be nothing more than the effect of weather erosion which happened to look like an inscription."&lt;ref name=her214&gt;[[#Herrmann|Herrmann (1954)]], p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian archaeologists and scholars have adopted a "negative attitude" toward the treatment of the site, with Herrmann noting that "Brazilian archaeology denies altogether the existence of Phoenician inscription in any part of the country whatsoever."&lt;ref name=her214 /&gt;

Spinoza was raised in a Portuguese-Jewish community in [[Amsterdam]]. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the nature of the [[God|Divine]]. [[Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)|Jewish religious authorities]] issued a ''[[Herem (censure)|herem]]'' ({{Hebrew|חרם}}) against him, causing him to be effectively shunned by Jewish society at age 23. His books were also later put on the Catholic Church's ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]''.

Spinoza lived an outwardly simple life as an optical [[lens (optics)|lens]] grinder, collaborating on microscope and telescope lens designs with [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.|Constantijn]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]]. He turned down rewards and honours throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions. He died at the age of 44 in 1677 from a lung illness, perhaps [[tuberculosis]] or [[silicosis]] exacerbated by the inhalation of fine glass dust while grinding lenses. He is buried in the churchyard of the Christian [[Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Speculum Spinozanum, 1677–1977 |first1=Benedictus |last1=de Spinoza |first2=Siegfried |last2=Hessing |publisher=[[Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul]] |year=1977 |page=828

Spinoza's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', was published posthumously in the year of his death. The work opposed Descartes' philosophy of [[mind–body dualism]], and earned Spinoza recognition as one of [[Western philosophy]]'s most important thinkers. In it, "Spinoza wrote the last indisputable Latin masterpiece, and one in which the refined conceptions of medieval philosophy are finally turned against themselves and destroyed entirely".{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=32}} [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] said, "The fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all."&lt;ref name="Hegel's History of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ESNZ3TUdN40C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=%22you+are+either+a+spinozist+or+not+a+philosopher+at+all%22 |title=Hegel's History of Philosophy |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513033919/https://books.google.com/books?id=ESNZ3TUdN40C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=%22you+are+either+a+spinozist+or+not+a+philosopher+at+all%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XRsqJEbyNT&amp;sig=bCClaJ9V6lL_CJbOR-S3zaGwHqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result| archivedate= 13 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical accomplishments and moral character prompted [[Gilles Deleuze]] to name him "the 'prince' of philosophers."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in the translator's preface of Deleuze ''Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family and community origins===
[[File:Spinoza -.jpg|thumb|His statue in Amsterdam]]
Spinoza's ancestors were of Sephardic Jewish descent and were a part of the community of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews |Portuguese Jews]] that had settled in the city of [[Amsterdam]] in the wake of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536), which had resulted in [[converso|forced conversions]] and expulsions from the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Attracted by the Decree of Toleration issued in 1579 by the [[Union of Utrecht]], Portuguese converts to Catholicism first sailed to Amsterdam in 1593 and promptly [[Anusim|reconverted to Judaism]].{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=15}} In 1598, permission was granted to build a synagogue, and in 1615 an ordinance for the admission and government of the Jews was passed.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=19}} As a community of exiles, the Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam were highly proud of their identity.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=19}}

Although the Portuguese name "de Espinosa" or "Espinosa," then spelled with a "z," can be confused with the Spanish "de Espinoza" or "Espinoza," there is no evidence in Spinoza's genealogy that his family came from [[Espinosa de los Monteros]], near [[Burgos]], or from [[Espinosa de Cerrato]], near [[Palencia]], both in [[Castile (historical region)|Northern Castile]], [[Spain]].{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=20}} Still, this was a common Portuguese ''conversos'' family name.&lt;ref&gt;The family was probably [[Alhambra decree|expelled from Spain]] in 1492 and fled to Portugal. Portugal compelled them to convert to Catholicism in 1498. Cf. Javier Muguerza in his ''Desde la perplejidad''; see also Ben-Menahem, Ari, ''Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1'' (Springer, 2009), p. 1095.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's father was born roughly a century after the forced conversions in the small Portuguese city of [[Vidigueira]], near [[Beja, Portugal|Beja]] in [[Alentejo]]. When Spinoza's father Miguel (Michael) was still a child, Spinoza's grandfather, Isaac de Spinoza, who was from [[Lisbon]], took his family to [[Nantes]] in France. They were expelled in 1615 and moved to [[Rotterdam]], where Isaac died in 1627. Spinoza's father and his uncle Manuel then moved to Amsterdam where they resumed the practice of Judaism. Miguel was a successful merchant and became a warden of the synagogue and of the Amsterdam Jewish school.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=19}} He buried three wives and three of his six children died before reaching adulthood.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=20}}

===17th-century Netherlands===
Amsterdam and Rotterdam operated as important [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] centres where merchant ships from many parts of the world brought people of various customs and beliefs. This flourishing commercial activity encouraged a culture relatively tolerant of the play of new ideas, to a considerable degree sheltered from the censorious hand of ecclesiastical authority (though those considered to have gone "too far" might have gotten  persecuted even in the Netherlands). Not by chance were the philosophical works of both Descartes and Spinoza developed in the cultural and intellectual background of the Dutch Republic in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, J. (1998), The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477–1806, Oxford, [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 4, 583, 677, 917.&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza may have had access to a circle of friends who were unconventional in terms of social tradition, including members of the [[Collegiants]].&lt;ref&gt;De Dijn, Herman, ''Spinoza: The Way to Wisdom'' ([[Purdue University Press]], 1996), pp. 3 &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the people he knew was [[Nicolas Steno|Niels Stensen]], a brilliant [[Denmark|Danish]] student in [[Leiden]];{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=195}} others included [[Albert Burgh]], with whom Spinoza is known to have corresponded.&lt;ref&gt;Curley, Edwin, "Spinoza's exchange with Albert Burgh," in Melamed &amp; Rosenthal (eds.), ''Spinoza's'' Theological-Political Treatise'': A Critical Guide'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mozes en Aäronkerk.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Spinoza lived where the [[Mozes en Aäronkerk (Amsterdam)|Moses and Aaron Church]] is located now, and there is strong evidence that he may have been born there.&lt;ref&gt;''Die Lebensgeschichte Spinozas.

Benedito de Espinoza was born on 24 November 1632 in the [[Jodenbuurt]] in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He was the second son of Miguel de Espinoza, a successful, although not wealthy, Portuguese [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jewish]] merchant in Amsterdam.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=1}} His mother, Ana Débora, Miguel's second wife, died when Baruch was only six years old.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=23|loc="his mother's death when he was six years old"}} Spinoza's mother tongue was Portuguese, although he also knew Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch, perhaps French, and later Latin.{{sfn|Nadler|1999|p=47}} Although he wrote in Latin, Spinoza learned the language only late in his youth.

Spinoza had a traditional Jewish upbringing, attending the Keter Torah [[yeshiva]] of the Amsterdam [[Talmud Torah]] congregation headed by the learned and traditional senior Rabbi [[Saul Levi Morteira]]. His teachers also included the less traditional Rabbi [[Manasseh ben Israel]], "a man of wide learning and secular interests, a friend of [[Gerardus Vossius|Vossius]], [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]], and [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]]".{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=8}} While presumably a star pupil, and perhaps considered as a potential rabbi, Spinoza never reached the advanced study of the Torah in the upper levels of the curriculum.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=1}} Instead, at the age of 17, after the death of his elder brother, Isaac, he cut short his formal studies in order to begin working in the family importing business.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=1}}

The precise date of Spinoza's first studies of Latin with Francis van den Enden ([[Franciscus van den Enden]]) is not known. Some state it began as early as 1654-1655, when Spinoza was 20; others note that the documentary record only attests to his presence in van den Enden's circle around 1657–58. Van den Enden was a notorious free thinker, former [[Jesuit]], and radical democrat who likely introduced Spinoza to scholastic and [[modern philosophy]], including that of Descartes.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=20-21}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=27}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=189}} (A decade later, in the early 1660s, Van den Enden was considered to be a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] and [[atheist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/fvde/Bio3.htm |title= Franciscus van den Enden/Biography |author=Frank Mertens, [[Ghent University]] |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his books were put on the Catholic [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Banned Books]].)

Spinoza's father, Miguel, died in 1654 when Spinoza was 21. He duly recited [[Kaddish]], the Jewish prayer of mourning, for eleven months as required by Jewish law.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=1}} When his sister Rebekah disputed his inheritance, he took her to court to establish his claim, won his case, but then renounced his claim in her favour.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}}

Spinoza adopted the Latin name Benedictus de Spinoza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Paul Strathern|Strathern]], Paul| title = Spinoza in 90 Minutes| date = 25 September 1998| publisher=[[Ivan R. Dee]]| isbn = 978-1-56663-215-7| pages = 24–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began boarding with Van den Enden, and began teaching in his school.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=27}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=189}} Following an anecdote in an early biography by [[Johannes Colerus]],&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Colerus, ''The Life of Benedict de Spinosa'' ([[London]]: Benjamin Bragg, 1706), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; he is said to have fallen in love with his teacher's daughter, Clara, but she rejected him for a richer student. (This story has been discounted on the basis that Clara Maria van den Enden was born in 1643 and would have been no more than about 13 years old when Spinoza left Amsterdam.{{sfn|Nadler|1999|p=104}} In 1671 she married [[Theodor Kerckring|Dirck Kerckring]].)

During this period Spinoza also became acquainted with the [[Collegiants]], an anti-clerical sect of [[Remonstrants]] with tendencies towards [[rationalism]], and with the [[Mennonite]]s who had existed for a century but were close to the Remonstrants.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=20}} Many of his friends belonged to dissident [[Christian]] groups which met regularly as discussion groups and which typically rejected the authority of established churches as well as traditional dogmas.&lt;ref name=tws908&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Anthony Gottlieb]] | title = God Exists, Philosophically (review of "Spinoza: A Life" by Steven Nadler) | publisher=[[The New York Times]], Books. 18 July 1999 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/18/reviews/990718.18gottlit.html | accessdate =7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's break with the prevailing dogmas of [[Judaism]], and particularly the insistence on non-[[Law of Moses|Mosaic]] authorship of the [[Pentateuch]], was not sudden; rather, it appears to have been the result of a lengthy internal struggle: "If anyone thinks my criticism [regarding the authorship of the Bible] is of too sweeping a nature and lacking sufficient foundation, I would ask him to undertake to show us in these narratives a definite plan such as might legitimately be imitated by historians in their chronicles... If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty [[Apollo]]. For I confess that all my efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery. Indeed, I may add that I write nothing here that is not the fruit of lengthy reflection; and although I have been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture, I have felt bound in the end to embrace the views I here express."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Benedictus de Spinoza, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus: Gebhardt Edition ([[E.J. Brill]], 1989), p. 179 (available at https://books.google.com/books?id=y3Cd7Yd73esC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, once branded as a heretic, Spinoza's clashes with authority became more pronounced. For example, questioned by two members of his synagogue, Spinoza apparently responded that God has a body and nothing in scripture says otherwise.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}} He was later attacked on the steps of the synagogue by a knife-wielding assailant shouting "Heretic!" He was apparently quite shaken by this attack and for years kept (and wore) his torn cloak, unmended, as a souvenir.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}}

After his father's death in 1654, Spinoza and his younger brother Gabriel (Abraham){{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=1}} ran the family importing business. The business ran into serious financial difficulties, however, perhaps as a result of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]]. In March 1656, Spinoza filed suit with the Amsterdam municipal authorities to be declared an orphan in order to escape his father's business debts and so that he could inherit his mother's estate (which at first was incorporated into his father's estate) without it being subject to his father's creditors.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=25}} In addition, after having made substantial contributions to the Talmud Torah synagogue in 1654 and 1655, he reduced his December 1655 contribution and his March 1656 pledge to nominal amounts (and the March 1656 pledge was never paid).{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=26}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=27}}

Spinoza was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his younger brother, Gabriel, and devote himself chiefly to the study of philosophy, especially the system expounded by [[Descartes]], and to [[optics]].

===Expulsion from the Jewish community===
On 27 July 1656, the Talmud Torah congregation of Amsterdam issued a writ of ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (Hebrew: {{hebrew|חרם}}, a kind of ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion, or [[excommunication]]) against the 23-year-old Spinoza.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}} The following document translates the official record of the censure:{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=120}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Lords of the ma'amad, having long known of the evil opinions and acts of Baruch de Espinoza, have endeavoured by various means and promises, to turn him from his evil ways. But having failed to make him mend his wicked ways, and, on the contrary, daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies which he practised and taught and about his monstrous deeds, and having for this numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and borne witness to this effect in the presence of the said Espinoza, they became convinced of the truth of the matter; and after all of this has been investigated in the presence of the honourable ''chachamin'' [sages], they have decided, with their consent, that the said Espinoza should be excommunicated and expelled from the people of Israel. By the decree of the angels, and by the command of the holy men, we excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Baruch de Espinoza, with the consent of God, Blessed be He, and with the consent of all the Holy Congregation, in front of these holy Scrolls with the [[613 commandments|six-hundred-and-thirteen precepts]] which are written therein, with the excommunication with which [[Joshua]] [[Battle of Jericho|banned Jericho]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Joshua]] 6, 26: "And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it."&lt;/ref&gt; with the curse with which [[Elisha#Biography|Elisha]] cursed the boys &lt;ref&gt;[[Second Book of Kings]] 2, 23–24: "And as he [Elisha] was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.&lt;/ref&gt; and with all the curses which are written in the Book of the Law. Cursed be he by day and cursed be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up; cursed be he when he goes out, and cursed be he when he comes in. The Lord will not spare him; the anger and wrath of the Lord will rage against this man, and bring upon him all the curses which are written in this book, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven, and the Lord will separate him to his injury from all the tribes of Israel with all the curses of the covenant, which are written in the Book of the Law. But you who cleave unto the Lord God are all alive this day. We order that no one should communicate with him orally or in writing, or show him any favour, or stay with him under the same roof, or within four [[ell]]s of him, or read anything composed or written by him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Espinoza estatua.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of Spinoza, near his house on the Paviljoensgracht in [[The Hague]].]]
The Talmud Torah congregation issued censure routinely, on matters great and small, so such an edict was not unusual.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Melamed, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University, speaking at an Artistic Director's Roundtable, Theater J, Washington D.C., 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=7}} The language of Spinoza's censure is unusually harsh, however, and does not appear in any other censure known to have been issued by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=2}} The exact reason for expelling Spinoza is not stated.&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Smith, ''Spinoza's book of life: freedom and redemption in the Ethics'', Yale University Press (1 December 2003), p. xx – Introduction [https://books.google.com/books?id=j0dMphwIwQ8C&amp;pg=PT19&amp;lpg=PT19&amp;dq=cherem+-+spinoza+-+unknown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OPBy3G58Jj&amp;sig=B4K5gEHFfPBwKtnK0kPxfqeE2mY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LlJITLe9FMT7lweKpMWbCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cherem%20-%20spinoza%20-%20unknown&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The censure refers only to the "abominable heresies that he practised and taught," to his "monstrous deeds," and to the testimony of witnesses "in the presence of the said Espinoza." There is no record of such testimony, but there appear to have been several likely reasons for the issuance of the censure.

First, there were Spinoza's radical theological views that he was apparently expressing in public. As philosopher and Spinoza biographer Steven Nadler puts it: "No doubt he was giving utterance to just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical treatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential God—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law was neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can there be any mystery as to why one of history's boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?"&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nadler, Baruch Spinoza, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, First published Fri 29 June 2001; substantive revision Mon 1 December 2008, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#Bio plato.standord.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the Amsterdam Jewish community was largely composed of former "conversos" who had fled from the Portuguese Inquisition within the previous century, with their children and grandchildren. This community must have been concerned to protect its reputation from any association with Spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for their own possible persecution or expulsion.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|pp=17-22}} There is little evidence that the Amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved in Spinoza's censure itself. But "in 1619, the town council expressly ordered [the Portuguese Jewish community] to regulate their conduct and ensure that the members of the community kept to a strict observance of Jewish law."{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=19}} Other evidence makes it clear that the danger of upsetting the civil authorities was never far from mind, such as bans adopted by the synagogue on public wedding or funeral processions and on discussing religious matters with Christians, lest such activity might "disturb the liberty we enjoy."{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=20}} Thus, the issuance of Spinoza's censure was almost certainly, in part, an exercise in self-censorship by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|pp=19-21}}

Third, it appears likely that Spinoza had already taken the initiative to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his ''Theological-Political Treatise'' that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves. Either for financial or other reasons,{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=28}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=189}} he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656. He had also committed the "monstrous deed," contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of some rabbinical authorities (including [[Maimonides]]), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=25}}—to renounce his father's heritage, no less. Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he is reported to have said: "Very well; this does not force me to do anything that I would not have done of my own accord, had I not been afraid of a scandal."{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}} Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn.

After the censure, Spinoza is said to have addressed an "Apology" (defence), written in Spanish, to the elders of the synagogue, "in which he defended his views as orthodox, and condemned the rabbis for accusing him of 'horrible practices and other enormities' merely because he had neglected ceremonial observances."{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}} This "Apology" [[Lost works|does not survive]], but some of its contents may later have been included in his ''Theological-Political Treatise''.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}} For example, he cited a series of cryptic statements by medieval Biblical commentator [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] intimating that some apparently anachronistic passages of the Pentateuch (i.e., "[t]he Canaanite was then in the land," Genesis 12:6, which ibn Ezra called a "mystery" and exhorted those "who understand it [to] keep silent") were not of [[Mosaic authorship]] as proof that his own views had valid historical precedent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The most remarkable aspect of the censure may be not so much its issuance, or even Spinoza's refusal to submit, but the fact that Spinoza's expulsion from the Jewish community did not lead to his conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Yitzhak Melamed 2012"&gt;Yitzhak Melamed, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University, speaking at an Artistic Director's Roundtable, Theater J, Washington D.C., 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza kept the Latin (and so implicitly Christian) name Benedict de Spinoza, maintained a close association with the [[Collegiants]] (a Christian sect of Remonstrants) and [[Quaker|Quakers]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benedict-de-Spinoza/Association-with-Collegiants-and-Quakers#ref1029792 Spinoza's Biography] in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;, even moved to a town near the Collegiants' headquarters, and was buried in a Christian Protestant graveyard—but there is no evidence or suggestion that he ever accepted baptism or participated in a Christian mass or Quaker meeting. Thus, by default, Baruch de Espinoza became the first secular Jew of modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Yitzhak Melamed 2012"/&gt;

In September 2012, the Portugees-Israëlietische Gemeente te Amsterdam asked the chief rabbi of their community [[Haham Pinchas Toledano]] to reconsider the cherem after consulting several Spinoza experts. However he declined to remove it, citing Spinoza's "preposterous ideas, where he was tearing apart the very fundamentals of our religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Simon Rocker | title = Why Baruch Spinoza is still excommunicated | newspaper = The Jewish Chronicle Online | date = August 28, 2014 | url = http://www.thejc.com/judaism/judaism-features/121838/why-baruch-spinoza-still-excommunicated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza spent his remaining 21 years writing and studying as a private scholar.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt;

Spinoza believed in a "Philosophy of tolerance and benevolence"&lt;ref name="God Exists, Philosophically"&gt;{{cite news|last1=GOTTLIEB|first1=ANTHONY|title=God Exists, Philosophically|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/18/reviews/990718.18gottlit.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actually lived the life which he preached. He was criticized and ridiculed during his life and afterwards for his alleged atheism. However, even those who were against him "had to admit he lived a saintly life".&lt;ref name="God Exists, Philosophically"/&gt; Besides the religious controversies, nobody really had much bad to say about Spinoza other than, "he sometimes enjoyed watching spiders chase flies".&lt;ref name="God Exists, Philosophically"/&gt;

After the cherem, the Amsterdam municipal authorities expelled Spinoza from Amsterdam, "responding to the appeals of the rabbis, and also of the Calvinist clergy, who had been vicariously offended by the existence of a free thinker in the synagogue".{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}} He spent a brief time in or near the village of [[Ouderkerk aan de Amstel]], but returned soon afterwards to Amsterdam and lived there quietly for several years, giving private philosophy lessons and grinding lenses, before leaving the city in 1660 or 1661.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}}

During this time in Amsterdam, Spinoza wrote his ''Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being'', which he never published in his lifetime—assuming with good reason that it might get suppressed. Two Dutch translations of it survive, discovered about 1810."{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}}

Spinoza moved around 1660 or 1661 from Amsterdam to [[Rijnsburg]] (near [[Leiden]]), the headquarters of the Collegiants.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=23}} In Rijnsburg, he began work on his ''Descartes' "Principles of Philosophy"'' as well as on his masterpiece, the ''Ethics''. In 1663, he returned briefly to Amsterdam, where he finished and published ''Descartes' "Principles of Philosophy,"'' the only work published in his lifetime under his own name, and then moved the same year to [[Voorburg]].{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=24}}

===Voorburg===
In Voorburg, Spinoza continued work on the ''Ethics'' and corresponded with scientists, philosophers, and theologians throughout Europe.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=25}} He also wrote and published his ''Theological Political Treatise'' in 1670, in defence of secular and constitutional government, and in support of [[Johan de Witt|Jan de Witt]], the Grand Pensionary of the Netherlands, against the Stadtholder, the Prince of Orange.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=25}}{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=26}} [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] visited Spinoza and claimed that Spinoza's life was in danger when supporters of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]] murdered de Witt in 1672.&lt;ref&gt;"…he [Spinoza] told me [Leibniz] he had a strong desire, on the day of the massacre of Mess. De Witt, to sally forth at night, and put up somewhere, near the place of the massacre, a paper with the words ''Ultimi barbarorum'' [ultimate barbarity]. But his host had shut the house to prevent his going out, for he would have run the risk of being torn to pieces."

===Lens-grinding and optics===
Spinoza earned a modest living from lens-grinding and instrument making, yet he was involved in important optical investigations of the day while living in Voorburg, through correspondence and friendships with scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] and mathematician [[Johannes Hudde]], including debate over microscope design with Huygens, favouring small objectives&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan Huygens, ''Oeuvres complètes'', Letter No. 1638, 11 May 1668&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborating on calculations for a prospective 40&amp;nbsp;ft. telescope which would have been one of the largest in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan Huygens, ''aOeuvres complètes'', letter to his brother 23 September 1667&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of Spinoza's lenses was much praised by Christiaan Huygens, among others.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=183}} In fact, his technique and instruments were so esteemed that [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.|Constantijn Huygens]] ground a "clear and bright" 42&amp;nbsp;ft. telescope lens in 1687 from one of Spinoza's grinding dishes, ten years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan Huygens, ''Oeuvres complètes'', vol. XXII, p. 732, footnote&lt;/ref&gt; The exact type of lenses that Spinoza made are not known, but very likely included lenses for both the microscope and telescope. He was said by anatomist [[Theodor Kerckring]] to have produced an "excellent" microscope, the quality of which was the foundation of Kerckring's anatomy claims.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Kerckring, "Spicilegium Anatomicum" Observatio XCIII (1670)&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as a lens and instrument maker, he was also supported by small but regular donations from close friends.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt;

===The Hague===
In 1670, Spinoza moved to [[The Hague]] where he lived on a small pension from Jan de Witt and a small annuity from the brother of his dead friend, Simon de Vries.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=26}} He worked on the ''Ethics'', wrote an unfinished Hebrew grammar, began his ''Political Treatise'', wrote two scientific essays ("On the Rainbow" and "On the Calculation of Chances"), and began a Dutch translation of the Bible (which he later destroyed by burning).{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=26}}

Spinoza was offered the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Heidelberg]], but he refused it, perhaps because of the possibility that it might in some way curb his [[freedom of thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Chauí 1995 (2001 ed.), ch. 1, pp. 30–31: |A commentary on Descartes' work, Principles of Cartesian Philosophy, only work published under his own name, brought him on an invitation to teach philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. Spinoza, however, refused, thinking that it might be demanded the renouncement of his freedom of thought, for the invite stipulated that all care should be taken to "not insult the principles of the established religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1676, Spinoza met with Leibniz at The Hague for a discussion of his principal philosophical work, ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', which had been completed in 1676. This meeting was described in [[Matthew Stewart (philosopher)|Matthew Stewart]]'s ''The Courtier and the Heretic''.&lt;ref name="Lucas1960"&gt;Lucas, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's health began to fail in 1676, and he died on 21 February 1677 at the age of 44.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=29}} His premature death was said to be due to lung illness, possibly [[silicosis]] as a result of breathing in glass dust from the lenses that he ground. Later, a shrine was made of his home in The Hague.&lt;ref name=tws9914&gt;{{cite news

When the public reactions to the anonymously published ''Theologico-Political Treatise'' were extremely unfavourable to his brand of Cartesianism, Spinoza was compelled to abstain from publishing more of his works. Wary and independent, he wore a [[signet ring]] which he used to mark his letters and which was engraved with the word ''caute'' (Latin for "cautiously") underneath a rose, itself a symbol of secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Matthew, ''The Courtier and the Heretic'' (W.

The ''Ethics'' and all other works, apart from the ''Descartes' Principles of Philosophy'' and the ''Theologico-Political Treatise'', were published after his death in the ''[[Opera Posthuma]]'', edited by his friends in secrecy to avoid confiscation and destruction of manuscripts.

In a letter, written in December 1675 and sent to Albert Burgh, who wanted to defend [[Catholicism]], Spinoza clearly explained his view of both Catholicism and [[Islam]]. He stated that both religions are made "to deceive the people and to constrain the minds of men". He also states that Islam far surpasses Catholicism in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.andrewbostom.org/2012/02/spinoza-on-islam/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Correspondence of Spinoza|first=Baruch|last=Spinoza|translator=A.

===Substance, attributes, and modes===
{{Main article|Philosophy of Baruch Spinoza}}
{{Quote|These are the fundamental concepts with which Spinoza sets forth a vision of Being, illuminated by his awareness of God. They may seem strange at first sight. To the question "What is?" he replies: "Substance, its attributes, and modes".|[[Karl Jaspers]]&lt;ref&gt;''Spinoza'', Karl Jaspers p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Spinoza argued that God exists and is abstract and impersonal.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; Spinoza's view of God is what [[Charles Hartshorne]] describes as [[Classical Pantheism]].&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953 ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza has also been described as an "[[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] materialist,"&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt; specifically in reference to his opposition to Cartesian mind-body dualism. This view was held by Epicureans before him, as they believed that atoms with their probabilistic paths were the only substance that existed fundamentally.&lt;ref name="Konstan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/epicurus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=David|last=Konstan|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=21 February 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', Part IV, preface: "''Deus seu Natura''".&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza, however, deviated significantly from Epicureans by adhering to strict determinism, much like the Stoics before him, in contrast to the Epicurean belief in the probabilistic path of atoms, which is more in line with contemporary thought on [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/spinoza.shtml|title=Baruch Spinoza, "Human Beings are Determined"|author=|date=|work=Lander.edu|access-date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Konstan"/&gt; Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical [[thought]], offering powerful weapons for prevailing against "received authority." He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality that surrounds us and of which we are part. Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality,&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt; namely a single, fundamental [[Substance theory|substance]] (meaning "that which stands beneath" rather than "matter") that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser "entities" are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause-and-effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published ''Ethics.''&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind–body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then it is not clear how they can coordinate in any manner. Humans presume themselves to have [[free will]], he argues, which is a result of their awareness of appetites that affect their minds, while being unable to understand the reasons why they desire what they desire and act as they do.

Spinoza contends that "''Deus sive Natura''" is a being of infinitely many attributes, of which thought and extension are two. His account of the nature of reality then seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined, causally related, and deriving from the same Substance. It is important to note that, in Parts 3 through 4 of the ''Ethics," Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors. He directly contests and denies dualism. The universal Substance emanates both body and mind; while they are different attributes, there is no fundamental difference between these aspects. This formulation is a historically significant solution to the [[mind–body problem]] known as [[neutral monism]]. Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by Providence, by which it can and does make changes, but a God that is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part. Spinoza argues that "things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case,";&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Spinoza. ''Ethics'', in'' Spinoza: Complete Works'', trans. by Samuel Shirley and ed. by Michael L. Morgan (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002), see Part I, Proposition 33.&lt;/ref&gt; he directly challenges a transcendental God that actively responds to events in the universe. Everything that has and will happen is a part of a long chain of cause-and-effect, which, at a metaphysical level, humans are unable to change. No amount of prayer or ritual will sway God. Only knowledge of God provides the best response to the world around them.
Not only is it impossible for two infinite Substances to exist (two infinities being absurd),&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part I, Proposition 6.&lt;/ref&gt; God as the ultimate Substance cannot be affected by anything else, or else it would be affected by something else, and not be the fundamental, all-pervasive Substance.

Spinoza was a thoroughgoing [[determinism|determinist]] who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of [[Need|necessity]]. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know that we are determined and to understand ''why'' we act as we do. By forming more "adequate" ideas about what we do and our emotions or [[Affect (philosophy)|affections]], we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This process allows us to become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.
Therefore, humans have no free will, despite strongly believing that they do. This illusionary perception of freedom stems from human consciousness, experience, and indifference to prior natural causes. Humans think they are free, but they ″dream with their eyes open″. For Spinoza, our actions are guided entirely by natural impulses. In his letter to G. H. Schuller (Letter 58), he wrote: "men are conscious of their desire and unaware of the causes by which [their desires] are determined."&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Pt. I, Prop. XXXVI, Appendix: "[M]en think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire."&lt;/ref&gt;

This picture of Spinoza's determinism is illuminated by this famous quote in ''Ethics'': ″the infant believes that it is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part III, Proposition 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are nonexistent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience that we have a false idea of choice predicated upon this.

Spinoza's philosophy has much in common with [[Stoicism]] inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfil a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness. Spinoza, however, differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: He utterly rejected their contention that [[reason]] could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]].{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=86}}

===Ethical philosophy===
Spinoza shared ethical beliefs with ancient Epicureans, in renouncing ethics beyond the material world, although Epicureans focused more on physical pleasure and Spinoza more on emotional wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html|title=Epicurus - Principal Doctrines|first=Vincent|last=Cook|date=|work=Epicurus.net|access-date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encapsulated at the start in his ''Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding'' (''Tractatus de intellectus emendatione'') is the core of Spinoza's ethical philosophy, what he held to be the true and final good. Spinoza held good and evil to be [[relativism|relative]] concepts, claiming that nothing is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particularity. Things that had classically been seen as good or evil, Spinoza argued, were simply good or bad for humans. Spinoza believes in a deterministic universe in which "All things in nature proceed from certain [definite] necessity and with the utmost perfection." Nothing happens by chance in Spinoza's world, and nothing is [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]].

Given Spinoza's insistence on a completely ordered world where "necessity" reigns, [[Good and evil|Good and Evil]] have no absolute meaning. The world as it exists looks imperfect only because of our limited perception.

===Spinoza's "''Ethics"''===
{{Main article|Ethics (Spinoza)}}
[[File:Spinoza Ethica.jpg|thumb|The opening page of Spinoza's ''magnum opus'', ''Ethics'']]

In the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects, or of God or Nature. According to Spinoza, reality is perfection. If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality. While components of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason, human grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence. Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful, is inadequate for discovering truth. His concept of "[[conatus]]" states that human beings' natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being, and asserts that virtue/human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as one's central ethical doctrine. According to Spinoza, the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God/Nature/Universe.

Also in the "Ethics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza discusses his beliefs about what he considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions. The first kind of knowledge he writes about is the knowledge of experiences. More precisely, this first type of knowledge can be known as the knowledge of things that could be "mutilated, confused, and without order."&lt;ref name="Ethics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics|date=1677|chapter=Books 1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning. Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a "passive" state. This type of "passive mind" that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions.
Spinoza’s second knowledge involves reasoning plus emotions. He explains that this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes that have to do with anything common to the human mind. An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.
Spinoza defines the third and final knowledge as the knowledge of God, which requires rationality and reason of the mind. In more detail, Spinoza uses this type of knowledge to join together the essence of God with the individual essence. This knowledge is also formed from any adequate causes that include perfect virtue.&lt;ref name="Ethics"/&gt;

In the final part of the "[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]", his concern with the meaning of "true blessedness", and his explanation of how emotions must be detached from external causes in order to master them, foreshadow psychological techniques developed in the 1900s. His concept of three types of knowledge—opinion, reason, intuition—and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal.

==History of reception==

===Pantheist, panentheist, or atheist?===
{{Main article|Spinozism}}{{see also|Pantheism controversy}}
[[File:Baruch de Spinoza cover portrait.jpg|thumb|right|An unfavorable engraving depiction of philosopher Spinoza, captioned in Latin, "A Jew and an Atheist".]]
It is a widespread belief that Spinoza equated God with the material universe. He has therefore been called the "prophet"&lt;ref&gt;Picton, J. Allanson, "Pantheism: Its Story and Significance", 1905&lt;/ref&gt; and "prince"&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Alexander Campbell "Philosophy of Theism", William Blackwood and Sons, 1895, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and most eminent expounder of [[pantheism]]. More specifically, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg he states, "as to the view of certain people that I identify God with Nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken".&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (26 March 2009), {{ISBN|978-1-60459-156-9}}, letter 73&lt;/ref&gt; For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a ''mode'' under two ''attributes'' of Thought and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]]. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world.

According to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883–1969), when Spinoza wrote ''{{lang|la|Deus sive Natura}}'' (Latin for 'God or Nature'), Spinoza meant God was ''{{lang|la|[[natura naturans]]}}'' (nature doing what nature does; literally, 'nature naturing'), not ''{{lang|la|[[natura naturata]]}}'' (nature already created; literally, 'nature natured'). Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence.&lt;ref name="ts64"&gt;Karl Jaspers, Spinoza (Great Philosophers), Harvest Books (23 October 1974), {{ISBN|978-0-15-684730-8}}, pp. 14, 95&lt;/ref&gt; Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course "divisible"; it has parts. But Spinoza said, "no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided", meaning that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance. He also said, "a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible" (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13).&lt;ref name="ts65"&gt;Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (2 October 1996), {{ISBN|978-0-415-10782-2}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, according to Jaspers, the pantheist formula "One and All" would apply to Spinoza only if the "One" preserves its transcendence and the "All" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.&lt;ref name=ts64/&gt;

[[Martial Guéroult]] (1891–1976) suggested the term "[[panentheism]]", rather than "pantheism" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, "in" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God.&lt;ref name=ts65/&gt; However, American panentheist philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897–2000) insisted on the term [[Classical Pantheism]] to describe Spinoza's view.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

In 1785, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] published a condemnation of Spinoza's pantheism, after [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Gotthold Lessing]] was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a "Spinozist", which was the equivalent in his time of being called an [[atheist]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and pantheism. The issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late 18th-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
* the unity of all that exists;
* the regularity of all that happens;
* the identity of spirit and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Frederick Albert|title=History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance, Vol. II|date=1880|publisher=Houghton, Osgood, &amp; Co.|location=Boston|page=147|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1879, Spinoza’s pantheism was praised by many, but was considered by some to be alarming and dangerously inimical.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pantheism of Spinoza Dr. Smith regarded as the most dangerous enemy of Christianity, and as he announced his conviction that it had gained the control of the schools, press and pulpit of the Old World [Europe], and was rapidly gaining the same control of the New [United States], his alarm and indignation sometimes rose to the eloquence of genuine passion."

Henry Smith, D.D., LL D., Professor of Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology in [[Lane Theological Seminary]], Consisting of Addresses on Occasion of the Anniversary of the Seminary, May 8th, 1879, Together with Commemorative Resolutions'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's "God or Nature" (''Deus sive Natura'') provided a living, natural God, in contrast to [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[first cause argument]] and the dead mechanism of [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]]'s (1709–1751) work, ''[[Man a Machine]]'' (''{{lang|fr|L'homme machine}})''. Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a ''religion of nature''.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; [[Novalis]] called him the "God-intoxicated man".&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws9902&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay "[[The Necessity of Atheism]]".&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt;

Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word "God" (Deus) to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. "Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Thilly, ''A History of Philosophy'', § 47, Holt &amp; Co., New York, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God&lt;ref&gt;"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings." These words were spoken by Albert Einstein, upon being asked if he believed in God by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue, New York, 24 April 1921, published in the New York Times, 25 April 1929; from ''Einstein: The Life and Times'' Ronald W. Clark, New York: World Publishing Co., 1971, p. 413; also cited as a telegram to a Jewish newspaper, 1929, Einstein Archive 33-272, from Alice Calaprice, ed., ''The Expanded Quotable Einstein'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University&lt;/ref&gt; is the antithesis to the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Spinoza's God is an "infinite intellect" (''Ethics'' 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), and capable of loving both himself—and us, insofar as we are part of his perfection (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends ''amor intellectualis dei'' (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that "neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God" (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. "He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return," says Spinoza (5p19).&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pantheism/#Per|title=Pantheism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Nadler]] suggests that settling the question of Spinoza's atheism or pantheism depends on an analysis of attitudes. If pantheism is associated with religiosity, then Spinoza is not a pantheist, since Spinoza believes that the proper stance to take towards God is not one of reverence or religious awe, but instead one of objective study and reason, since taking the religious stance would leave one open to the possibility of error and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#GodNat |title=Baruch Spinoza (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to Eastern philosophies===
Similarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authors. The 19th-century German Sanskritist [[Theodor Goldstücker]] was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the [[Vedanta]] tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was &lt;blockquote&gt;... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker, W. H. Allen, 1879. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Westminster Review, Volumes 78–79, Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, 1862. p. 1862&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Max Müller]], in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying "the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'."&lt;ref&gt;Three Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy. F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay "As to Spinoza's Deity—natura naturans—conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity—as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct out-flowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple."&lt;ref&gt;H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings, Volume 13, pp. 308–10. Quest Books&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoza's reception in the 19th and 20th centuries===

Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries grew even more interested in Spinoza, often from a left-wing or [[Marxist]] perspective. [[Karl Marx]] liked Spinoza's account of the universe, interpreting it as [[Materialism|materialistic]].&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; The philosophers [[Louis Althusser]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Étienne Balibar]] have each drawn upon Spinoza's philosophy. Deleuze's doctoral thesis, published in 1968, calls him "the prince of philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nietzsche]] esteemed few philosophers, but he esteemed Spinoza.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, "FOURTH DIVISION Concerning the Soul of Artists and Authors", in ''Human, All-Too-Human: Parts One and Two: Pt. I&amp;II'' (Dover Philosophical Classics), Kindle Edition (2012-03-15), Aphorism 157, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, "EIGHTH DIVISION A Glance at the State", in ''Human, All-Too-Human: Parts One and Two: Pt. I&amp;II'' (Dover Philosophical Classics), Kindle Edition (2012-03-15), Aphorism 475, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, "PART I Miscellaneous Maxims and Opinions", in ''Human, All-Too-Human: Parts One and Two: Pt. I&amp;II'' (Dover Philosophical Classics), Kindle Edition (2012-03-15), Aphorism 408, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nietzsche never read Spinoza's works themselves, but learned about Spinoza from [[Kuno Fischer]]'s ''History of Modern Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Urs Sommer]]: Nietzsche’s Readings on Spinoza. A Contextualist Study, Particularly on the Reception of Kuno Fischer, in: ''Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' 43/2 (2012), pp. 156–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[George Santayana]] graduated from college, he published an essay, "The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza", in ''The Harvard Monthly''.&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, "The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza", ''The Harvard Monthly'', 2 (June 1886: 144–52)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he wrote an introduction to ''Spinoza's Ethics and "De intellectus emendatione"''.&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, "Introduction", in ''Spinoza's Ethics and "De intellectus emendatione"''(London: Dent, 1910, vii–xxii)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Santayana was invited to present an essay (published as "Ultimate Religion")&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, "Ultimate Religion", in ''Obiter Scripta'', eds. Justus Buchler and Benjamin Schwartz (New York and London: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1936) 280–97.&lt;/ref&gt; at a meeting at [[The Hague]] celebrating the tricentennial of Spinoza's birth. In Santayana's autobiography, he characterized Spinoza as his "master and model" in understanding the naturalistic basis of morality.&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, ''Persons and Places'' (Cambridge, MA and London: MIT Press, 1986) 233–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoza's religious criticism and its effect on the philosophy of language===
[[File:Spinoza Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.jpg|right|thumb|''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'']]
Philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] evoked Spinoza with the title (suggested to him by [[G. E. Moore]]) of the English translation of his first definitive philosophical work, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', an allusion to Spinoza's ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]''. Elsewhere, Wittgenstein deliberately borrowed the expression ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'' from Spinoza (''Notebooks, 1914-16'', p.&amp;nbsp;83). The structure of his ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' does have some structural affinities with Spinoza's ''Ethics'' (though, admittedly, not with the latter's own ''Tractatus'') in erecting complex philosophical arguments upon basic logical assertions and principles. Furthermore, in propositions 6.4311 and 6.45 he alludes to a Spinozian understanding of eternity and interpretation of the religious concept of eternal life, stating that "If by eternity is understood not eternal temporal duration, but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present." (6.4311) "The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation as a limited whole." (6.45)

[[Leo Strauss]] dedicated his first book, ''Spinoza's Critique of Religion'', to an examination of the latter's ideas. In the book, Strauss identified Spinoza as part of the tradition of Enlightenment rationalism that eventually produced Modernity. Moreover, he identifies Spinoza and his works as the beginning of Jewish Modernity.&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt; More recently [[Jonathan Israel]] argued that, from 1650 to 1750, Spinoza was "the chief challenger of the fundamentals of revealed religion, received ideas, tradition, morality, and what was everywhere regarded, in absolutist and non-absolutist states alike, as divinely constituted political authority."&lt;ref&gt;Israel, J. (2001) Radical Enlightenment; Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750, Oxford, Oxford University Press, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoza in literature, art, and popular culture===
Spinoza has had influence beyond the confines of philosophy.
*Spinoza's ''Tractatus theologico-politicus'' was presented to the Chair of the Dutch Parliament, and shares a shelf with the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4500/Politiek/article/detail/3282363/2012/07/05/Van-der-Ham-biedt-Verbeet-Spinoza-aan---voor-naast-Bijbel-en-Koran.dhtml |title=Van der Ham biedt Verbeet Spinoza aan |publisher=RTL Nieuws | date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 17th-century philosopher [[John Locke]], who also spent time in Amsterdam, was influenced by his "pioneering and profound conceptions of religious tolerance and democratic government," according to Cornel West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=West|first1=Cornel|title=The spirit of Spinoza|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/07/28/the_spirit_of_spinoza_cornel_west/|accessdate=6 December 2017|publisher=Boston Globe|date=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 19th-century novelist [[George Eliot]] produced her own translation of the ''Ethics'', the first known English translation of it. Eliot liked Spinoza's vehement attacks on superstition.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt;
*In his autobiography ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit|From My Life: Poetry and Truth]]'', [[Goethe]] recounts the way in which Spinoza's ''Ethics'' calmed the sometimes unbearable emotional turbulence of his youth. Goethe later displayed his grasp of Spinoza's metaphysics in a fragmentary elucidation of some Spinozist ontological principles entitled ''Study After Spinoza''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textlog.de/41473.html |title=Goethe: Studie nach Spinoza – Aufsätze und Rezensionen |publisher=Textlog.de |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110513034307/http://www.textlog.de/41473.html |archivedate = 13 May 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he cited Spinoza alongside Shakespeare and [[Carl Linnaeus]] as one of the three strongest influences on his life and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html |title=Linné on line – What people have said about Linnaeus |publisher=Linnaeus.uu.se |accessdate=2 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608101238/http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html |archivedate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 20th century novelist [[W. Somerset Maugham]] alluded to one of Spinoza's central concepts with the title of his novel ''[[Of Human Bondage]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*In the early ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]", the antagonist, [[Gary Mitchell (Star Trek)|Gary Mitchell]] is seen reading Spinoza, and Mitchell's remark regarding his ease in comprehending Spinoza implies that his intellectual capacity is increasing dramatically. The dialogue indicates that [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] is familiar with Spinoza's work, perhaps as part of his studies at [[Starfleet Academy]].
*In the ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' episode "[[M*A*S*H (season 6)|Fade Out, Fade In, Part 2]]", Major Charles Emerson Winchester, on his exile to Korea, describes himself as someone who "can quote Spinoza from memory".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5el200&lt;/ref&gt;
PBS television series, Jeeves and Wooster (1993) Season 4 Episode 2 has Spinoza as a central part of the plot.  This episode draws on the book Joy in the Morning by PG Wodehouse which also includes Jeeves desire to own a copy of the latest edition of Spinoza’s work.
*[[Albert Einstein]] named Spinoza as the philosopher who exerted the most influence on his [[world view]] (''Weltanschauung''). Spinoza equated God (infinite substance) with Nature, consistent with Einstein's belief in an impersonal deity. In 1929, Einstein was asked in a telegram by [[Herbert S. Goldstein|Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein]] whether he believed in God. Einstein responded by telegram: "I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings."&lt;ref name=tws9903&gt;{{cite news

*Spinoza is an important historical figure in the [[Netherlands]], where his portrait was featured prominently on the Dutch 1000-[[Dutch guilder|guilder]] [[banknote]], [[legal tender]] until the euro was introduced in 2002. The highest and most prestigious scientific award of the Netherlands is named the [[Spinoza Prize|''Spinozaprijs'' (Spinoza prize)]].

*The 2008 play "New Jerusalem", by [[David Ives]], is based on the cherem (ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion or excommunication) issued against Spinoza by the Talmud Torah congregation in Amsterdam in 1656, and events leading to it.

*In ''Bento's Sketchbook'' (2011), the writer [[John Berger]] combines extracts from Spinoza, sketches, memoir, and observations in a book that contemplates the relationship of materialism to spirituality.

At the '''Battle of Vitoria''' (21 June 1813) a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] army under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|General the Marquess of Wellington]] broke the French army under [[Joseph Bonaparte]] and Marshal [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] near [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]] in Spain, eventually leading to victory in the [[Peninsular War]].

==Background==
In July 1812, after the [[Battle of Salamanca]], the French had evacuated [[Madrid]], which Wellington's army entered on 12 August 1812. Deploying three divisions to guard its southern approaches, Wellington marched north with the rest of his army to lay siege to the fortress of [[Burgos]], {{convert|140|mi|km}} away, but he had miscalculated the enemy's strength, and on 21 October he had to abandon the [[Siege of Burgos]] and retreat. By 31 October he had abandoned Madrid too, and retreated first to [[Salamanca]] then to [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], near the Portuguese frontier, to avoid encirclement by French armies from the north-east and south-east.

Wellington spent the winter reorganizing and reinforcing his forces. By contrast, Napoleon retreated numerous soldiers to reconstruct his main army after his [[French invasion of Russia|disastrous invasion]] of [[Russia]]. By 20 May 1813 Wellington marched 121,000 troops (53,749 British, 39,608 Spanish and 27,569 Portuguese{{sfnp|Gates|2002|p=521}}) from northern [[Portugal]] across the mountains of northern Spain and the [[Esla River]] to outflank Marshal Jourdan's army of 68,000, strung out between the [[Douro]] and the [[Tagus]]. The French retreated to Burgos, with Wellington's forces marching hard to cut them off from the road to France. Wellington himself commanded the small central force in a strategic feint, while [[Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch|Sir Thomas Graham]] conducted the bulk of the army around the French right flank over landscape considered impassable.

Wellington launched his attack with 57,000 British, 16,000 Portuguese and 8,000 Spanish at Vitoria on 21 June, from four directions.{{sfnp|Gates|2002|p=386}}

==Terrain==
The battlefield centres on the Zadorra River, which runs from east to west. As the [[Zadorra]] runs west, it loops into a hairpin bend, finally swinging generally to the southwest. On the south of the battlefield are the Heights of La Puebla. To the northwest is the mass of Monte Arrato. Vitoria stands to the east, two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) south of the Zadorra. Five roads radiate from Vitoria, north to [[Bilbao]], northeast to [[Leintz-Gatzaga|Salinas]] and [[Bayonne]], east to [[Salvatierra/Agurain|Salvatierra]], south to [[Logroño]] and west to [[Burgos]] on the south side of the Zadorra.

==Plans==
[[File:Vitoria - Museo de Armeria 06.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Recreation with model figures of the battle, displayed at the [[:es:Museo de Armería de Álava|Armory Museum (Museo de Armería)]] in Vitoria-Gasteiz.]]

Jourdan was ill with a fever all day on 20 June. Because of this, few orders were issued and the French forces stood idle. An enormous wagon train of booty clogged the streets of Vitoria. A convoy left during the night, but it had to leave siege artillery behind because there were not enough draft animals to pull the cannons.

[[Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière|Gazan]]'s divisions guarded the narrow western end of the Zadorra valley, deployed south of the river. Maransin's brigade was posted in advance, at the village of [[Subijana_de_Álava|Subijana]]. The divisions were disposed with [[Jean François Leval|Leval]] on the right, Daricau in the centre, [[Nicolas François Conroux|Conroux]] on the left and [[Eugène-Casimir Villatte|Villatte]] in reserve. Only a picket guarded the western extremity of the Heights of La Puebla.

Further back, [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]]'s force stood in a second line, also south of the river. [[Jean Barthélemy Darmagnac|Darmagnac's]] division deployed on the right and [[Louis Victorin Cassagne|Cassagne's]] on the left. D'Erlon failed to destroy three bridges near the river's hairpin bend and posted Avy's weak cavalry division to guard them. [[Honoré Charles Reille|Reille]]'s men originally formed a third line, but [[Jacques Thomas Sarrut|Sarrut]]'s division was sent north of the river to guard the Bilbao road while Lamartinière's division and the Spanish Royal Guard units held the river bank.

Wellington directed Hill's 20,000-man Right Column to drive the French from the Zadorra [[defile (geography)|defile]] on the south side of the river. While the French were preoccupied with Hill, Wellington's Right Centre column moved along the north bank of the river and crossed it near the hairpin bend behind the French right flank.

Graham's 20,000-man Left Column was sent around the north side of Monte Arrato. It drove down the Bilbao road, cutting off the bulk of the French army. Dalhousie's Left Centre column cut across Monte Arrato and struck the river east of the hairpin, providing a link between Graham and Wellington.

==Battle==
{{see also|Battle of Vitoria order of battle}}
[[File:Battle of Vitoria map.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the battle]]
Wellington's plan split his army into four attacking "columns", attacking the French defensive position from south, west and north while the last column cut down across the French rear. Coming up the Burgos road, Hill sent [[Pablo Morillo]]'s Division to the right on a climb up the Heights of La Puebla. Stewart's 2nd Division began deploying to the left in the narrow plain just south of the river. Seeing these moves, Gazan sent Maransin forward to drive Morillo off the heights. Hill moved Col. Henry Cadogan's brigade of the 2nd Division to assist Morillo. Gazan responded by committing  Villatte's reserve division to the battle on the heights.

About this time, Gazan first spotted Wellington's column moving north of the Zadorra to turn his right flank. He asked Jourdan, now recovered from his fever, for reinforcements. Having become obsessed with the safety of his left flank, the marshal refused to help Gazan, instead ordering some of D'Erlon's troops to guard the Logroño road.

Wellington thrust [[James Kempt]]'s brigade of the [[Light Division]] across the Zadorra at the hairpin. At the same time, Stewart took Subijana and was counterattacked by two of Gazan's divisions. On the heights, Cadogan was killed, but the Anglo-Spanish force managed to hang on to its foothold. Wellington suspended his attacks to allow Graham's column time to make an impression and a lull descended on the battlefield.

At noon, Graham's column appeared on the Bilbao road. Jourdan immediately realised he was in danger of envelopment and ordered Gazan to pull back toward Vitoria. Graham drove Sarrut's division back across the river, but could not force his way across the Zadorra despite bitter fighting. Further east, Longa's Spanish troops defeated the Spanish Royal Guards and cut the road to Bayonne.

With some help from Kempt's brigade, Picton's 3rd Division from Dalhousie's column crossed to the south side of the river. According to Picton, the enemy responded by pummelling the 3rd with 40 to 50 [[cannon]] and a counter-attack on their right flank, still open because they had captured the bridge so quickly, causing the 3rd to lose 1,800 men (over one third of all Allied losses at the battle) as they held their ground.&lt;ref name=Amotz&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DMkJ3xvg34AC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA85,M1 Historical Record of the Seventy-fourth Regiment (Highlanders)], [[Richard Cannon]], Published by Parker, Furnivall &amp; Parker, 1847&lt;/ref&gt; Cole's 4th Division crossed further west. With Gazan on the left and d'Erlon on the right, the French attempted a stand at the village of Arinez. Formed in a menacing line, the 4th, Light, 3rd and 7th Divisions soon captured this position. The French fell back to the Zuazo ridge, covered by their well-handled and numerous field artillery. This position fell to Wellington's attack when Gazan refused to cooperate with his colleague d'Erlon.

French morale collapsed and the soldiers of Gazan and d'Erlon fled from the field. Artillerists left their guns behind as they fled on the trace horses. Soon the road was jammed with a mass of wagons and carriages. The efforts of Reille's two divisions, holding off Graham, allowed tens of thousands of French troops to escape by the Salvatierra road.

==Aftermath==
The Allied army lost about 5,000 men, with 3,675 British, 921 Portuguese and 562 Spanish casualties.{{sfnp|Glover|2001|p=243}} French losses totalled at least 5,200 killed and wounded, plus 2,800 men and 151 cannon captured. By army, the losses were South 4,300, Centre 2,100 and Portugal 1,600. There were no casualty returns from the Royal Guard or the artillery.{{sfnp|Smith|1998|p=427}}

French losses were not higher for several reasons. First, the Allied army had already marched {{convert|20|mi|km}} that morning and was in no condition to pursue. Second, Reille's men valiantly held off Graham's column. Third, the valley by which the French retreated was narrow and well-covered by the 3rd Hussar and the 15th Dragoon Regiments acting as rearguard. Last, the French left their booty behind.{{sfnp|Glover|2001|p=243}}

[[File:Auction after Vitoria.jpg|thumb|left|185px|British troops auction off loot taken during the battle]]
Many British soldiers turned aside to plunder the abandoned French wagons, containing "the loot of a kingdom". It is estimated that more than £1 million of booty (perhaps £100 million in modern equivalent) was seized, but the gross abandonment of discipline caused an enraged Wellington to write in a dispatch to [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl Bathurst]], "We have in the service the scum of the earth as common soldiers".&lt;ref&gt;Wellington to Bathurst, dispatches, p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; The British general also vented his fury on a new cavalry regiment, writing, "The [[18th Royal Hussars|18th Hussars]] are a disgrace to the name of soldier, in action as well as elsewhere; and I propose to draft their horses from them and send the men to England if I cannot get the better of them in any other manner."{{sfnp|Glover|2001|p=243}} (On 8{{nbsp}}April 1814, the 18th redeemed their reputation in a gallant charge led by [[Henry Murray (British Army officer)|Lieutenant-colonel Sir Henry Murray]] at Croix d'Orade, shortly before the [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Battle of Toulouse]].)

Order was soon restored, and by December, after detachments had seized [[San Sebastián]] and [[Pamplona]], Wellington's army was encamped in France.

The battle was the inspiration for [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] Opus 91, often called the "Battle Symphony" or "[[Wellington's Victory]]", which portrays the battle as musical drama.  The climax of the movie ''[[The Firefly (film)|The Firefly]]'', starring [[Jeanette MacDonald]], occurs with Wellington's attack on the French centre. (The film used music from an opera of the same name by [[Rudolf Friml]], but with a totally different plot.) The battle and French rout also forms the climax to [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s book ''[[Sharpe's Honour]]''.

During the decennial [[England]] and [[Wales]] [[Census]]es of 1841 to 1901, the individual schedules returned from each household were transcribed and collated by the census enumerators into '''Census Enumerators’ Books''' (CEBs).

It is these CEBs that are used by researchers in the fields of [[social science]], local and [[family history]] etc.

Their contents changed over time.

'''Claude Buffier''' (25 May 1661 &amp;ndash; 17 May 1737), [[France|French]] [[philosopher]], [[historian]] and [[teacher]], was born in [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] of French parents, who returned to [[France]] and settled in [[Rouen]] soon after his birth.
{{jesuit}}
He was educated at the [[Jesuit]] college there, and he was received into the Order at the age of nineteen. A dispute with the archbishop compelled him to leave Rouen. After a short stay in [[Rome]], he returned to [[Paris]] to the college of the Jesuits, where he spent the rest of his life. He seems to have been a good teacher and lucid expositor.

==Works==

His goal in the ''Traité des premières vérités'' (Paris: 1724), his best-known work, was to discover the ultimate principle of knowledge. This he found in the sense we have of our own existence and of what we feel within ourselves, He thus took substantially the same ground as [[René Descartes|Descartes]], but he rejected the ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' method. In order to know what exists distinct from the self, common sense is necessary. Common sense he defined as that disposition which nature has placed in all or most men, in order to enable them, when they have arrived at the age and use of reason, to form a common and uniform judgment with respect to objects different from the internal sentiment of their own perception, which judgment is not the consequence of any anterior judgment.

The truths which this disposition of nature obliges us to accept can be neither proved nor disproved; they are practically followed even by those who reject them speculatively. But Buffier did not claim for these truths of common sense the absolute certainty which characterizes the knowledge we have of our own existence or the logical deductions we make from our thoughts; they possess merely the highest probability, and the man who rejects them is to be considered a fool, though he is not guilty of a contradiction.

Buffier's aversion to scholastic refinements gives to his writings an appearance of shallowness and want of metaphysical insight, and unquestionably he failed entirely even to indicate the nature of that universality and necessity which he ascribed to his eternal verities; he was, however, one of the earliest to recognize the psychological as distinguished from the [[metaphysical]] side of Descartes's principle, and to use it, with no inconsiderable skill, as the basis of an analysis of the human mind, similar to that enjoined by [[John Locke|Locke]]. In this he has anticipated [[Thomas Reid]] and the Scottish school. [[Voltaire]] described him as the only Jesuit who has given a reasonable system of philosophy.

[[File:Claude buffier map of france.JPG|thumb|Claude Buffier, map of France.]]

He also wrote ''Elémens de métaphysique'' (1725), ''Suite de la Grammaire française sur un plan nouveau'' (1709) ["Sequel to A New Method of French Grammar"], and a number of historical essays. Most of his works appeared in a collected form in 1732, and an English translation of the ''Traité'' was published in 1780.

While the new tensions between Russia and the West have similarities with those during the original Cold War, there are also major dissimilarities such as modern Russia's increased economic ties with the outside world, which may potentially constrain Russia's actions&lt;ref name=JStewart&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=James|title=Why Russia Can't Afford Another Cold War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/business/why-russia-cant-afford-another-cold-war.html|accessdate=3 January 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provide it with new avenues for exerting influence, such as in [[Belarus]] and [[Central Asia]], which have not brought on the type of direct military action in which Russia engaged in less cooperative former Soviet states like [[Ukraine]] or the [[Caucasus]] region.&lt;ref name=Gas&gt;{{Cite news|title =Putin's 'Last and Best Weapon' Against Europe: Gas |date = 24 September 2014|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/10/03/putins-last-and-best-weapon-against-europe-gas-272652.html |accessdate= 3 January 2015|first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Cold War II" has therefore been described as a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morm.gov.mk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sovremena-makedonska-odbrana-br.26-en.pdf "The Cold War II: Just Another Misnomer?"], ''Contemporary Macedonian Defence'', vol. 14. no. 26, June 2014, pp. 49–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Cold War II" gained currency and relevance as tensions between Russia and the West escalated throughout the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]] followed by the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention]] and especially the downing of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] in July 2014.

In an interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in December 2014, Gorbachev said that the US under [[Obama]] was dragging Russia into a new Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shuster|first1=Simon|title=Exclusive: Gorbachev Blames the U.S. for Provoking 'New Cold War'|url=http://time.com/3630352/mikhail-gorbachev-vladimir-putin-cold-war/|publisher=TIME|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, at the [[Munich Security Conference]], NATO Secretary General [[Jens Stoltenberg]] said that NATO and Russia were "not in a cold-war situation but also not in the partnership that we established at the end of the Cold War",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian PM Medvedev says new cold war is on|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35569094|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Russian [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]], speaking of what he called [[NATO]]'s "unfriendly and opaque" policy with regard to Russia, said: "One could go as far as to say that we have slid back to a new Cold War."&lt;ref name="dw13-02-2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/13/europe/russia-medvedev-new-cold-war/ |publisher=CNN|title=Russian PM Medvedev equates relations with West to a 'new Cold War'|date=13 February 2016 |access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 and March 2017, Stoltenberg repeatedly said to, respectively, [[BBC News]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NATO chief says alliance 'does not want new Cold War' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37795668 |website=BBC |date=28 October 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then CBS News&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Palmer |date=14 March 2017 |title=What our allies, and Putin, make of Trump's NATO ultimatum |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-jens-stoltenberg-russia-vladimir-putin-us-europe-allies/ |website=CBS News |accessdate=12 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that NATO would not seek "a new Cold War" or "a new arms race" with Russia.

In February 2016, a [[National Research University – Higher School of Economics|National Research University]] academic and [[Harvard University]] visiting scholar Yuval Weber wrote on ''[[E-International Relations]]'' that "the world is not entering Cold War II", asserting that the current tensions and ideologies of both sides are not similar to those of the original Cold War, that situations in Europe and the Middle East do not destabilize other areas geographically, and that Russia "is far more integrated with the outside world than the Soviet Union ever was".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Yuval |last=Weber |date=7 March 2016 |title=Are We in a Cold War or Not? 1989, 1991, and Great Power Dissatisfaction |url=http://www.e-ir.info/2016/03/07/are-we-in-a-cold-war-or-not-1989-1991-and-great-power-dissatisfaction/ |website=E-International Relations |accessdate=11 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, when asked if he thought the world had entered a new cold war, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Foreign Minister]] [[Sergey Lavrov]] argued that current tensions were not comparable: he noted the lack of an ideological divide between the United States and Russia, saying that conflicts were no longer viewed from the perspective of a [[Polarity (international relations)#Bipolarity|bipolar international system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lavrov|first1=Sergey|title=Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s remarks and answers to questions at a meeting with students and faculty at MGIMO University, Moscow, September 1, 2016 |url=http://www.mid.ru/en/press_service/minister_speeches/-/asset_publisher/7OvQR5KJWVmR/content/id/2417731|accessdate=8 September 2016|agency=The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, [[John Sawers]], a former [[MI6]] chief, told BBC Radio 4's ''Today'' programme that he thought the world was entering an era that was possibly "more dangerous" than the Cold War, as "we do not have that focus on a strategic relationship between Moscow and Washington".&lt;ref name=indepsawer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborne|first1=Samuel|last2=|first2=|title=World entering era 'more dangerous than Cold War′ as Russian power grows, former MI6 boss warns|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/russia-cold-war-sir-john-sawers-warns-syria-washington-moscow-a7357421.html|accessdate=28 October 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Igor Zevelev]], a fellow at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Wilson Center]], said, "[I]t's not a Cold War [but] a much more dangerous and unpredictable situation."&lt;ref name=cnnOct18&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labott|first1=Elise|last2=Gaouette|first2=Nicole|title=Russia, US move past Cold War to unpredictable confrontation|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/12/politics/us-russia-tensions-cold-war/index.html|accessdate=28 October 2016|agency=CNN|date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN opined, "It's not a new Cold War. It's not even a deep chill. It's an outright conflict."&lt;ref name="cnnOct18"/&gt;

In January 2017, a former government adviser Molly K. McKew said at ''[[Politico]]'' that the US would win the "new Cold War" if the war happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Molly K. |last=McKew |date=1 January 2017 |title=Putin's Real Long Game |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/putins-real-long-game-214589 |website=Politico |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Republic]]'' editor Jeet Heer dismissed the possibility as "equally troubling[,] reckless threat inflation, wildly overstating the extent of Russian ambitions and power in support of a costly policy", and too centred on Russia while "ignoring the rise of powers like China and India". Heer also criticized McKew for supporting the possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeet |last=Heer |date=4 January 2017 |title=A 'New Cold War' Against Russia Is a Terrible Idea |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/139600/new-cold-war-russia-terrible-idea |website=The New Republic |accessdate=15 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Shapiro]], a senior fellow in the [[Brookings Institution]], wrote in his blog post at ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'', referring to the US–Russia relations: "A drift into a new Cold War has seemed the inevitable result."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shapiro |first=Jeremy |title=Reordering Europe? |url=http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2017/01/11/reordering_europe_112169.html |website=[[RealClearWorld]] |date=11 January 2017 |accessdate=15 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister [[Sergei Ryabkov]] denied claims that the US and Russia are having another Cold War, despite ongoing tensions between the two countries and newer US sanctions against Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Vladimir |last=Isachenkov |date=23 August 2017 |title=Russian official says US and Russia aren't in new Cold War |url=https://apnews.com/6c65ed5e3614465c9a323b53cd2aee9c |website=Associated Press |accessdate=5 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] told journalist [[Megyn Kelly]] in an interview, "My point of view is that the individuals that have said that a new Cold War has started are not analysts. They do propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lee Yen Nee |date=1 March 2018 |title=Putin: Our new weapons 'easily' beat anti-missile systems – but this is no Cold War |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/nbc-interviews-russia-president-vladimir-putin-on-weapons-cold-war.html |website=CNBC |accessdate=4 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Kofman, a senior [[Research Scientist|research scientist]] at the [[CNA Corporation]] and a [[fellow]] at the [[Wilson Center]]'s [[Kennan Institute]] said that the new Cold War for Russia "is about its survival as a power in the international order, and also about holding on to the remnants of the Russian empire". Lyle Goldstein, a [[research professor]] at the [[US Naval War College]] claims that the situations in [[Russo-Georgian War|Georgia]] and [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Ukraine]] "seemed to offer the requisite storyline for new Cold War".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43581449|title=Russia v the West: Is this a new Cold War?|last=Marcus|first=Jonathan|date=2018-04-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amidst the deterioration in relation between both sides over a potential US-led military strike in Middle East after [[Douma chemical attack]] and [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|poisoning of the Skripals]], [[Antonio Guterres]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], told a meeting of the [[UN Security Council]] in April 2018 that "the Cold War was back with a vengeance". He suggested the dangers were even greater as the safeguards that existed to manage such a crisis earlier, "no longer seem to be present".&lt;ref name="Guterres"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43759873|title=Syria crisis: UN chief says Cold War is back|date=13 April 2018|accessdate=13 April 2018|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dmitri Trenin]] supported Guterres' statement, but added it had already begun in 2014 and was intensifying since, resulting in [[2018 bombing of Damascus and Homs|U.S.-led strikes on the Syrian government]] on 13 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/14/the-new-cold-war-is-boiling-over-in-syria/|title=The New Cold War Is Boiling Over in Syria|last=Trenin|first=Dmitir|date=2018-04-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talk of a "new Cold War" between a United States-led block of countries on the one hand and the putative Beijing-Moscow axis, including explicit references to it in the official PRC′s media, intensified in the summer of 2016 as a result of the [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|territorial dispute]] in the [[South China Sea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pilling|first1=David|title=US v China: is this the new cold war?|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a301aa60-0dcf-11e5-aa7b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz45ywfYbht|website=Financial Times|accessdate=16 April 2016|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;, when China defied the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]]′s [[Philippines v.

In July 2018, Michael Collins, deputy assistant director of the CIA's East Asia mission center, told the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado that he believed China under paramount leader [[Xi Jinping]], while unwilling to go to war, was waging a "quiet kind of cold war" against the United States, seeking to replace the U.S. as the leading global power.

The '''Creusot steam hammer''' was a giant [[steam hammer]] built in 1877 by [[Schneider and Co.]] in the [[France|French]] industrial town of [[Le Creusot]]. With the ability to deliver a blow of up to 100 tons, the Creusot hammer was the most powerful in the world until 1891, when the [[Bethlehem Iron Company]] of the [[United States]] purchased [[patent rights]] from Schneider and built a steam hammer of almost identical design but capable of delivering a 125-ton blow.

The Creusot hammer still exists, although it is no longer operational, and is a tourist attraction in the town of Le Creusot, where it was built. With few remaining rivals, the hammer today is once again the largest of its kind in the world.

The Creusot steam hammer was named a [[List of historic mechanical engineering landmarks|Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="ASME"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Landmarks/Creusot_Steam_Hammer_1876.cfm|title=Creusot Steam Hammer (1876)|accessdate=2009-01-18|work=Landmarks|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASMEpdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/10265.pdf|format=PDF|title=Creusot Steam Hammer|accessdate=2009-01-18|work=Creusot Steam Hammer brochure|publisher=[[ASME]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031024805/http://files.asme.org/asmeorg/Communities/History/Landmarks/10265.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In 1836, [[Eugène Schneider|Joseph Eugène Schneider]] and his brother [[Adolphe Schneider]] purchased a derelict ironworks in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], near the town of Le Creusot, and founded Schneider Brothers &amp; Co. (later renamed Schneider &amp; Co.). Two years later the company produced the first [[steam locomotive]] to be built in France. Eugène Schneider along with the company's chief engineer, [[François Bourdon]], developed the world's first true steam hammer at the Schneider works in 1841. Schneider and Co. went on to build 110 steam hammers of all sizes between 1843 and 1867, 26 of which were employed by the firm itself. As the jobs grew more demanding, the hammers grew correspondingly larger, and the Schneiders eventually saw a need for a hammer of colossal proportions.

The Creusot steam hammer was completed in 1877, and with its ability to deliver a blow of up to 100 tons, eclipsed the previous record set by the [[Germany|German]] firm [[Krupp]], whose steam hammer "Fritz", with its 50-ton blow, had held the title as the world's most powerful steam hammer since 1861. In celebration of this technological achievement, a full-scale wooden replica of the Creusot hammer was built and displayed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition]] of 1878.

The hammer is composed of four distinct parts — the foundation including the [[anvil]], the legs, the steam [[Pneumatic cylinder|cylinder]] and its [[valves]] and linkages, and finally, the active mass itself — the [[piston]], [[piston rod]], hammerhead and [[die (manufacturing)|die]].

The anvil weighed a massive 750 [[ton]]s, and in order to support the weight and the hammer blows, the machine's foundations were built of solid masonry resting on bedrock 11 meters below the soil. A one-metre thick bed of [[oak]] timber topped the masonry foundation and provided the immediate floor for the giant anvil.

The four legs are hollow cast and rectangular in cross-section. They were originally bolted to plates embedded in the masonry. The legs are 10.25 meters high and connected to one another at the top in a rigid A-frame design by a 30-ton "table", that in its working life both guided the hammerhead and distributed the shock of its blows. One leg supports the operator's platform from which the machine was controlled.

The steam cylinder itself is 6 meters high and has an inside diameter of 1.9 meters. Steam pressure averaging 5&amp;nbsp;kg/cm² or 71&amp;nbsp;psi drove the cylinder upwards through two balanced single-acting slide valves, after which the force of gravity would allow the hammer to fall and deliver a blow.

The piston had a maximum travel of 5 meters and the piston rod was 35 centimeters in diameter. The hammerhead or tup was interchangeable, with a number of differently shaped dies which may account for the hammer's reported variable force of between 75 and 100 tons. The actual energy delivered may have been in the order of 3.3 million [[foot-pound]]s (or 500,000 kilogram-metres).{{cref|Force}}&lt;ref name="ASMEpdf" /&gt;

Four separate [[furnace]]s provided steam power to four adjacent swan-necked [[steam crane|cranes]], which were used for manipulating the massive 120-ton iron and steel ingots delivered to the hammer for forging. Six [[Bessemer converter]]s supplied the steel for the ingots, which were transported on a railway line built expressly for the purpose through the works.

For a comparison of scale, the world's largest modern hydraulic [[Forging#Forging presses|forging presses]] can apply force of about 80,000 tons.

===Demonstrations===

In its heyday, the hammer would sometimes give public demonstrations of its accuracy. It could be used to cork a bottle, crack a nut without damaging the contents, or tap a watch glass without breaking it. With such demonstrations, steam hammers for a time became symbols of industrial precision.

==Redundancy==

Steam hammers were eventually made redundant with the introduction of [[hydraulic press|hydraulic]] and [[mechanical press|mechanical]] [[Forging#Press forging|steel presses]], which could apply force more evenly and create better quality product. The giant American hammer built by Bethlehem Iron which had superseded the Creusot hammer in 1891 was demolished by 1902, but the Creusot hammer itself had a much longer service life, in use for 54 years until its final retirement in 1930.

==Tourist attraction==

In 1969 the Creusot hammer was dismantled and reassembled in Le Creusot town square. Although it has no source of steam in its current location and is therefore non-functional, it still serves as a tourist attraction and a reminder of a bygone era of technological achievement.

==Footnotes==

&lt;small&gt;
{{cnote|Force|The figure for the 'actual force delivered', 3.3 million [[foot-pound]]s (or 500,000 kilogram-metres) was calculated by "multiplying the maximum weight of the falling mass by the length of its travel." All figures and units have been obtained from the reference, foot-pounds actually being a measure of [[Work (physics)|work]] not force.&lt;ref name="ASMEpdf" /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1654">'''Cumméne Find''' ([[Latin]]ised, '''Cummeneus Albus''', Cumméne "the White", died 669) was the seventh [[abbot]] of [[Iona]] (657–669). It was during Cumméne's abbacy that the [[Northumbrians]] decided against adopting the Gaelic dating of [[Easter]] at the [[Synod of Whitby]], resulting in the loss of control of the Ionan offshoot Gaelic church at [[Lindisfarne]]. In 664, the last Gaelic abbot/[[bishop of Lindisfarne]], [[Colman of Lindisfarne|Colmán]], resigned his post and returned to Iona. It was during Cumméne's abbacy that the [[Book of Durrow]] was first produced, although this probably happened at [[Durrow, County Offaly|Durrow]] itself, rather than Iona. Cumméne is known to have visited Ireland in 663, perhaps on a tour of daughter houses. He is known to have written a now largely lost ''[[Hagiography|Vita]]'' of [[Columba]]. He died on February 24, 669.

'''Dillā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: दिल्ला) is the ninth month in the [[Nepal Era]] calendar, the national [[lunar calendar]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Sambat gets national status |url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5 |accessdate=17 May 2014 |newspaper=The Rising Nepal |date=24 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020104054/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5 |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The month coincides with [[Aashaadha|Āsāṛh]] (आषाढ) in the [[Hindu lunar calendar]] and [[July]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

Dillā begins with the [[new moon]] and the [[full moon]] falls on the 15th of the [[lunar month]]. The month is divided into the bright and dark fortnights which are known as Dillā Thwa (दिल्ला थ्व) and Dillā Gā (दिल्ला गा) respectively.

Among the major events of the month, the 11th day of the bright fortnight is Hari Sayani Ekādashi which marks the beginning of the [[Hindu]] deity [[Vishnu]]'s four-month cosmic sleep. On the 12th day, devotees plant the [[Tulsi in Hinduism|Tulsi]] plant ([[Holy basil]]) in their homes. The plant represents Vishnu.

The full moon day is [[Guru Purnima|Guru Purnimā]] when teachers are honored. The holiday is also known as Dillā Punhi and is sacred to [[Buddhist]]s as the day when the [[Buddha]] gave his first sermon and set in motion the [[Dharmacakra]], the Wheel of Dharma. The first day of the dark fortnight is the start of [[Vassa]], the three-month rains retreat for Buddhist monks when they remain in their monasteries.

The festival of Gathān Mugah Charhe (गथां मुगः चह्रे) is celebrated on the 14th day of the dark fortnight when evil spirits are chased out of the city limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levy |first= Robert Isaac |date=1990 |title= Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal|chapter=A Catalogue of Annual Events and Their Distribution throughout the Lunar Year |publisher= University of California Press |page=652 |isbn=9780520069114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Relief flute player Glyptothek Munich.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Classical Athens|Attic]] [[relief]] (4th century BCE) depicting an ''[[aulos]]'' player and his family standing before [[Dionysos]] and a female consort, with theatrical [[masks]] displayed above.]]
The '''dithyramb''' ({{lang-grc|διθύραμβος}}, ''dithyrambos'') was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[hymn]] sung and danced in honor of [[Dionysus]], the god of [[wine]] and [[fertility]]; the term was also used as an [[epithet]] of the god:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2326816 Dithurambos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus. ''Dithyrambos'' seems to have arisen out of the hymn: just as ''paean'' was both a hymn to and a title of [[Apollo]], ''Dithyrambos'' was an [[epithet]] of Dionysos as well as a song in his honour; see Harrison (1922, 436).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]], in ''[[Laws (dialogue)|The Laws]]'', while discussing various kinds of music mentions "the birth of Dionysos, called, I think, the dithyramb."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Laws'',  iii.700 B.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato also remarks in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' that dithyrambs are the clearest example of poetry in which the poet is the only speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|title=Republic|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D3%3Asection%3D394c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in [[Apology (Plato)|The Apology]] Socrates went to the dithyrambs with some of their own most elaborate passages, asking their meaning but got a response of, "Will you believe me?" which "showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|title=The Republic &amp;#124; Edited by Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler |url=http://www.feedbooks.com/book/678/apology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] contrasted the dithyramb's wild and [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstatic]] character with the [[paean]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Ei at Delphi''. Plutarch himself was a priest of Dionysos at Delphi.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], the dithyramb was the origin of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449a10–15): "Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the [[Fertility rite|phallic processions]] which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature"; see Janko (1987, 6).&lt;/ref&gt; A wildly enthusiastic speech or piece of writing is still occasionally described as ''dithyrambic''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dithyrambic Definition of dithyrambic]. [[TheFreeDictionary.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dithyrambs were sung by choirs at [[Delos]], but the literary fragments that have survived are largely [[Classical Athens|Athenian]]. In Athens, dithyrambs were sung by a [[Greek chorus]] of up to fifty men or boys dancing in circular formation, who may or may not have been dressed as [[Satyr]]s, probably accompanied by the ''[[aulos]]''. They would normally relate some incident in the life of [[Dionysus]] or just celebrate wine and fertility.

The ancient Greeks laid out the criteria of the dithyramb as follows:
* special rhythm
* ''[[aulos]]'' accompaniment in [[Phrygian mode]] &lt;ref&gt;Harvey (1955). [[Aristotle]] records the failed attempt to set it in [[Dorian mode]], in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (8.7).&lt;/ref&gt;
* enriching text
* considerable narrative content
* originally [[Antistrophe|antistrophic character]]

Competitions between groups singing and dancing dithyrambs were an important part of the festivals of Dionysis, such as the [[Dionysia]] and [[Lenaia]]. Each tribe would enter two choirs, one of men and one of boys, each under the leadership of a ''[[coryphaeus]]''. The names of the winning teams of dithyrambic contests in Athens were recorded. The successful ''[[choregos]]'' would receive a statue that would be erected—at his expense—as a public monument to commemorate the victory. However, most of the poets remain unknown.

The earliest mention of dithyramb, found by [[Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge|Sir Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;Pickard-Cambridge, Sir Arthur Wallace. 1927. ''Dithyramb, Tragedy and Comedy''. Second edition revised by T.B.L. Webster, 1962. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-814227-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in a fragment of [[Archilochus]], who flourished in the first half of the seventh century BCE: "I know how to lead the fair song of the Lord Dionysus, the dithyramb, when my wits are fused with wine." As a literary composition for chorus, their inspiration is unknown, although it was likely Greek, as [[Herodotus]] explicitly speaks of [[Arion]] of [[Lesbos]] as "the first of men we know to have composed the dithyramb and named it and produced it in [[Corinth]]".&lt;ref&gt;Pickard-Cambridge, Sir Arthur Wallace. 1927. ''Dithyramb Tragedy and Comedy''. Second edition revised by T.B.L. Webster, 1962. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-814227-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''dithyramb'' has no known origin, but is frequently assumed to not be derived from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] eymology (''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 333–4).&lt;/ref&gt; An old hypothesis is that the word is borrowed from [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] or [[Pelasgian language|Pelasgian]], and literally means "Vierschritt", i.&amp;nbsp;e., "four-step", compare ''[[Iamb (poetry)|iamb]]'' and ''[[thriambus]]'', but H. S. Versnel rejects this etymology and suggests instead a derivation from a cultic exclamation.&lt;ref name="Versnel1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Versnel|first=H. S.|title=Triumphus: An Inquiry Into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPjBSq2jCrcC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=2 January 2015|year=1970|publisher=Brill Publishers|location=Leiden, Netherlands|isbn=90-04-02325-9|pages=16–38|chapter=I. 2 Θρίαμβος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dithyrambs were composed by the poets [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]] and [[Bacchylides]], as well as [[Pindar]] (the only one whose works have survived in anything like their original form).

Later examples were dedicated to other gods, but the dithyramb subsequently was developed (traditionally by [[Arion]]) into a literary form.&lt;ref&gt;Feder, (1998, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] developed from the dithyramb; the two forms developed alongside one another for some time. The clearest sense of dithyramb as proto-tragedy comes from a surviving dithyramb by Bacchylides, though it was composed after tragedy had already developed fully.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/ClasDram/chapters/042reading1dithyramb.htm USU.edu] and [http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/kvhrtgn/CLT%20Readings/A%20DITHYRAMB.htm UFL.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060727023728/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/kvhrtgn/CLT%20Readings/A%20DITHYRAMB.htm |date=2006-07-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacchylides' dithyramb is a dialogue between a solitary singer and a choir. It is suggestive of what tragedy may have resembled before [[Aeschylus]] added a second actor instead of the choir.

In the later 5th century BCE, the dithyramb "became a favorite vehicle for the musical experiments of the poets of the 'new music'."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, "Dithyramb," in N.G. Wilson (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece'', Routledge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This movement included the poets [[Timotheus of Miletus]], [[Cinesias (poet)|Cinesias]], [[Melanippides]], and [[Philoxenus of Cythera]]. By the 4th century BCE the [[genre]] was in decline, although the dithyrambic competitions did not come to an end until well after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] takeover of Greece.

==Modern dithyrambs==
Dithyrambs are rare in [[English language]] literature. In [[German literature]] they appear more frequently, and from the 19th century several compositions were inspired by them.

===Literature===
[[John Dryden]]'s ''[[Alexander's Feast (Dryden)|Alexander's Feast]]'' (1697) is a notable example of an English language dithyramb.

[[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote a ''Dithyrambe'' in 1796. [[Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]] composed a set of ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs|Dionysos-Dithyramben]]'' in 1888/89.&lt;ref&gt;See the comprehensive commentary in [[Andreas Urs Sommer]], Kommentar zu Nietzsches Der Antichrist. Ecce homo. Dionysos-Dithyramben. Nietzsche contra Wagner (= Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften (Hg.): Historischer und kritischer Kommentar zu Friedrich Nietzsches Werken, vol. 6/2), Berlin / Boston: Walter de Gruyter 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and dance===
From the 19th century dithyrambs appear frequently in [[classical music]], as well in vocal as instrumental compositions.

[[Franz Schubert]] wrote a song for bass voice based on Schiller's ''Dithyrambe'' ({{D.}} 801, published as Op. 60 No. 2 in 1826). Schubert's earlier attempt at setting the same poem for a more extended vocal ensemble had remained unfinished ({{D.|number=47}}, 1813). [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]] (in ''Schillers lyrische Gedichte'' volume 2, published around 1809) and [[Wilhelm Taubert]] (Op. 144 No. 2, 1864) were other composers setting Schiller's poem. Other composers basing vocal music on dithyrambs include [[Giuseppe Verdi]] ("[[Brindisi (Song Verdi)|Brindisi]]", No. 6 of his 1845 ''[[Album di Sei Romanze (Verdi)|Album di Sei Romanze]]''), and [[Max Bruch]] (Op. 39, {{circa}} 1871). [[Othmar Schoeck]]'s 1911 [[List of compositions by Othmar Schoeck#Lieder|''Dithyrambe'', Op.&amp;nbsp;22]] is based on an unnamed verse by [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Werk- und Nachlassverzeichnis Othmar Schoeck (1886 – 1957)''. Zentralbibliothek Zürich. p. 29. See also [http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=6588 Dithyrambe 'Alles geben die Götter, die unendlichen'] at The LiederNet Archive, and: Marcel Reich-Ranicki. [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/frankfurter-anthologie/marcel-reich-ranicki-in-der-frankfurter-anthologie-alles-geben-die-goetter-von-johann-wolfgang-von-goethe-12603935.html "„Alles geben die Götter“ von Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"] in ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', 4 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instrumental dithyrambs were composed by [[Robert Volkmann]] and [[Hermann Ritter]]. [[Nikolai Medtner]] composed several dithyrambs, including a set of three for solo piano as his Opus 10. Additionally, the final movement of his first violin sonata carries the title, and the last of his ''Vergessene Weisen'' Op. 40 is a ''Danza ditirambica''.

The last movement of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''Duo Concertant'' for violin and piano is entitled ''Dithyrambe''. [[Richard Edward Wilson]]'s 1983 ''Dithyramb'' is for oboe and clarinet. [[Wolfgang Rihm]] composed a 30-minute work, ''Concerto'', in 2000, with the subtitle ''Dithyrambe'' and a scoring for string quartet and orchestra. 

In 1961 the American choreographer [[James Waring]] created a dance piece entitled ''Dithyramb'' with music and objects by the Fluxus artist [[George Brecht]].

[[File:StateLibQld 1 296739 Debutantes holding bouquets at a social dance, 1952.jpg|thumb|250px|Debutante dresses in Australia in 1952]]
[[File:Debutantes having a dress rehearsal, February 2009.jpg|thumb|250px|American debutantes, February 2009]]

A '''debutante dress''' is a white [[gown]], accompanied by white [[gloves]] and [[pearls]] worn by girls or young women at their [[debutante ball|debutante cotillion]]. Debutante cotillions were traditional [[coming of age]] celebrations for eligible young ladies ready to be presented to society as ready for marriage.

==Required rules of dress==
A young lady's gown was regulated by a set of meticulously defined rules which were strictly enforced. These rules varied from monarchy to monarchy and didn't always follow the fashion of the time. White was the preferred color for her gown, although soft colors such as ivory or eggshell were acceptable as long as they were over a white background.&lt;ref name="Etiquette"&gt;{{cite book| first=Emily| last=Post| date=2007| title=Etiquette: In Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home| url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1602061149| publisher=Cosimo Inc|isbn=978-1-60206-114-9| pages=276–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headdress always included feathers and a veil although the number and size of the feathers varied with the time. Married women wore a [[tiara]].&lt;ref name="Presentation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aiello|first=Dawn|title=Presentation At Court|url=http://www.thehistorybox.com/ny_city/society/printerfriendly/nycity_society_presentation_article0011.htm|publisher=Victorian Lace|website=www.thehistorybox.com|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Georgian era==
During the reign of [[King George III]] and [[Queen Charlotte]], the debutante dress featured a [[hoop skirt]] and elaborate trimmings which included a single ostrich plume worn on the head, even though simple dresses with high waists were favored. During the reign of [[King George IV]], the hoop skirt was excluded and the style for a debutante gown became a variation of whatever was considered popular for formal evening wear during the period.&lt;ref name="Presentation"/&gt;

==Victorian era==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 109648 Agnes Melanie Dickson as a debutante, ca. 1890.jpg|thumb|A debutante dress ca. 1890]]
Débutante dresses were almost always short-sleeved and had to have a low neckline.&lt;ref name="The Berg"&gt;{{cite book|first=Valerie|last=Steele|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1847885926|publisher=Berg Publishers|date=2010|pages=204–205|isbn=978-1-84788-563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a doctor's certificate could be presented at the time stating that low cut was injurious to the young woman's health.&lt;ref name="Presentation"/&gt; After a débutante married, if she had married appropriately, she would be re-presented at Court as a married woman, usually wearing her wedding dress with alterations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frelinghuysen|first=Alice Cooney|title=American porcelain, 1770-1920|year=1989|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=9780810911789|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UJLxwwrVEyoC&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Victoria]] was said to have hated small feathers, so orders were sent out that Her Majesty wished to see the feathers as the young lady approached. Late in Queen Victoria's reign and into the court of [[Edward VII]], the necessary headdress was three feathers arranged in a Prince of Wales plume. A center feather slightly higher than the two on each side worn slightly on the left side of the head.&lt;ref name="Presentation"/&gt;

For young ladies and women to be presented who were in mourning, it was acceptable for their dresses and veils to be black. No matter how cold the weather was on this special day, absolutely no cloaks, shawls, capes, or wraps of any kind were permitted to be worn. Those items remained in the lady's carriage.&lt;ref name="Presentation"/&gt;

== Biography ==
Emin was born in [[Dobrich]] in the region of [[Dobruja]]. At the time, the town was part of the [[Principality of Bulgaria]]; from 1913 to 1940, it was in Romanian possession and named ''Bazargic''. He received his primary and secondary schooling in Romania, in Bazargic and [[Bucharest]]. Since his early youth he was interested in folklore joining Romanian and Bulgarian folk groups. Then he organized several Crimean Tatar folk ensembles and wrote and staged such didactic plays as ''Şahin Giray Han'', ''Atilla'', ''Bora'', ''Kîrîm'', ''Kók-kóz Bayar''. In 1930, in [[Constanta]], he joined the group led by Músteğip Úlkúsal founding the Crimean Tatar journal ''Emel''.&lt;ref name="Kalgay"/&gt;

Bektóre immigrated to Turkey in 1940 and settled in [[Eskişehir]] carrying out significant work for Tatars folk culture.
&lt;ref name="Rast"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdullah|first1=Akat|title=The Influences and Changes of the Crimean Tatar Music in the Process|journal=Rast Musicology Journal|date=Spring 2013|volume=1|issue=1|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8rZ1ETmO44wC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=emin+bektore+eskisehir#v=onepage&amp;q=emin%20bektore%20eskisehir&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There he continued teaching and counseling folklore. He was a forerunner and developer of ethnography and folklore initiatives in Turkey.&lt;ref name="Kalgay"/&gt; Thanks to his activities [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] [[folk dance]] and [[music]] have been included in the educational [[curriculum]] in the province of [[Eskişehir]].&lt;ref name="Allworth"/&gt;

He campaigned for national Tatar causes. In the sixties he met again, this time in Turkey, Mústecip Úlkúsal and other leading [[Crimean Tatars in Romania|Crimean Tatar]] activists such as Cafer Seydamet Kırımer and Edige Kırımal restarting his contribution to ''Emel'', [[Turkey|Turkish]] series.&lt;ref name="Kalgay"/&gt;

Bektóre died on 15 April 1995.&lt;ref name="Kalgay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allworth"/&gt;

The '''English Place-Name Society''' ('''EPNS''') is a [[learned society]] concerned with [[toponomastics]] and the [[toponymy of England]], in other words, the study of place-names ([[toponyms]]).

Its scholars aim to explain the origin and history of the names they study, taking into account factors such as the meaning of the elements out of which they were created (which can be in languages such as [[Old English]], or early [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] or [[Cornish language|Cornish]] etc.); the topography, geology and ecology of the places bearing the names; and the general and local history and [[culture of England]].

==History==
In 1922 Professor Allen Mawer read a paper to the [[British Academy]] about setting up an English place-name survey.  He obtained the formal and financial support of the Academy.  Within a year he had brought into being a society composed of interested persons, provided it with a constitution and laid down the lines of its future conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Armstong ''et al.'', 1992–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the Society were first at the [[University of Liverpool]], where Mawer was Professor of English Language. The publications of the Society began in 1924 with two volumes, a collection of essays and a dictionary of place-name elements. Mawer and Aileen Armstrong acted as General Editors for the annual volumes of county place-name surveys. From 1929 J. E. B. Gover collected material and was sub-editor of the volumes.

In 1929 Professor Mawer was appointed Provost of [[University College, London]] and the Society moved there at the end of the year. When World War II came the Society moved briefly to [[University College, Aberystwyth]], back to London, and then to [[Stansted Bury]] on the [[Hertfordshire]]/[[Essex]] border. In July 1942 Sir Allen Mawer died, and Sir [[Frank Stenton]] became General Editor. The Society moved to the [[University of Reading]] until 1946. When Professor [[Bruce Dickins]] succeeded as Honorary Director the Society moved to the [[University of Cambridge]], and Miss Margaret Midgley (later Dr [[Margaret Gelling]]) was appointed Research Assistant.

When Professor [[Albert Hugh Smith|Hugh Smith]] assumed the position of Honorary Director in 1951, University College, London became once more the Society's headquarters, with [[Margaret Gelling|Margaret Midgley]] continuing research there until 1953. Hugh Smith produced two new "Elements" volumes and 14 others on county place-names. On his death in 1967 Professor Kenneth Cameron became Honorary Director and the Society's offices were split between London and Nottingham, where the university provided room for the Library and Archives, as well as the services of a secretary.  In 1972 the Society moved completely to Nottingham where it remains at the Centre for Name Studies. [[Victor Watts]] became Honorary Director in 1992 until his death in 2002 when he was succeeded by Professor [[Richard Coates]].

The Survey has been consistently supported, morally and practically, by the [[British Academy]]; and from 2005 to 2010 was supported by a large grant from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]].

==Publications==
By 2018 the Society had published 91 volumes of the county-by-county [https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/epns/survey.aspx Survey of English Place-Names], aimed mainly at scholarly and academic users, a range of books and booklets on names organised by region or by category (e.g. field-names), and some county dictionaries aimed mainly at a non-specialist audience.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/epns/survey/volumes.aspx

https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/epns/other-publications.aspx; &lt;/ref&gt; Most English counties are now covered by volumes in the place-name survey, although early volumes are not as detailed as the later ones. The Survey volumes for the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire and parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire are available free of charge on the [https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/epns/downloads.aspx English Place-Name Society website].  From the 1960s there has been a change in the interpretation of some place-names, resulting from the detailed comparison of distributions of the place-name types which had been thought to be early Saxon and archaeological evidence. There was originally also a bias towards interpreting names as [[Anglo-Saxon]], and some have now been shown to be more likely [[Celts|Celtic]]. [[Kenneth Hurlstone Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]] advised on Celtic names.  

EPNS material was used as the basis of ''The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names'', published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Watts 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Society published its first volume in the "Popular Series", on the county of Suffolk.

The Society is starting to publish a new series of booklets on place-name elements, but it is likely to be some time before this is complete.

Since 1969, the Society has published an annual [https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/epns/journal.aspx ''Journal''], which contains essays on various place-name topics.

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 70.107.13 Epa Mask.jpg|thumbnail|Epa Mask, collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
An '''Epa mask''' is a ceremonial mask worn by the [[Yoruba people]] of [[Nigeria]] during the Epa masquerade. Carvings representing priests, hunters, farmers, kings, and mothers are usually depicted on the masks. They are used to acknowledge important roles within the community, and to honor those who perform the roles, as well as ancestors who performed those roles in the past.&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=70|url=http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/gutoco.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910171202/http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/gutoco.html|archivedate=2011-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not being used during performances, Epa masks are kept in shrines where they are the focus of prayers and offerings from community elders.&lt;ref name=BMA /&gt;

==History==
Epa masks originated from the seventeen kingdoms which make up the [[Ekiti State|Ekiti region]] in the north-east of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] territory. Unlike other parts of Yorubaland, Ekiti has been subject to extensive foreign influences. The area received successive waves of immigration from [[Ife]] in the sixteenth century and from the [[Bini people|Bini]] in the seventeenth, as well as being the target of military raids from [[Ilorin]] and [[Ibadan]] in the middle or late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Forde&gt;{{cite book|last=Forde|first=D.|title=Yoruba Speaking People of Southwest Nigeria|year=1951|publisher=International African Institute|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the area was considered to have formed part of the [[Benin empire]].&lt;ref name=Akintoye&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akintoye|first=S.A.|title=The Benin Kingdom and the north-eastern districts of Yoruba country|journal=JAHSN|year=1969|volume=4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, its population has a complex mixed ethnic origin which has given rise to some unique traditions not previously found elsewhere in Yorubaland but which have since spread to the [[Iyagba]], [[Igbomina]], [[Oshun]], [[Owo]] and [[Ijesha]] regions. It is also not surprising to find that the warrior figures often surmounting Epa masks represent heroes who proved their mettle during this long period of instability.&lt;ref name=Shelton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shelton|first=Anthony|title=A Yoruba Epa Mask by Fasiku Alaye|journal=Journal of Museum Ethnography|year=1998|volume=10|pages=121–124|publisher=Museum Ethnographers Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Epa masks consist of a [[Janus]] faced helmet and an often elaborate figurative superstructure usually carved with a female or equestrian figure at its center. Surrounding the central figure are typically smaller figures, representing  traders, musicians, hunters and other personages central to Yoruba community life. Many Epa masks bear names like 'Mother with Children', 'Owner of Many Children', 'Children Cover Me' (like a protecting cloth), 'Children are Honorable to Have', 'Bringer of Children', 'Mother of Twins', 'Nursing Mother' and many other similar appellations, which occur in the songs that accompany the dancers.&lt;ref name=Ojo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ojo|first=J.R.|title=The symbolism and significance of Epa-type masquerade headpieces|journal=Man |series=New Series|year=1978|volume=13|issue=457470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The helmet is always simply carved, often with two faces, and is reminiscent of a mortar or pot. Such similarities are made explicit in the term for the helmet, ''tkiko'' ('pot'), alluding to it as a container of spiritual power and otherworldly force, [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. The eyes of one face are usually carved open, looking out to the world of the living, while those on the other are sealed, contemplating the realm of the divine and the ancestors. Much [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] ceremonial is concerned with the control and focusing of this divine force for the benefit of the community. The control and focusing of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] is a central theme throughout the different episodes that make up the Epa festival as well as apparently constituting a theme in other ceremonies in which Epa masks are used. The equestrian figures from episodes from the region's turbulent history incorporate representations of the channeling of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] to safeguard the conquering hero. Maternity figures invoke [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] for increasing procreative abilities and fertility, while references to medicine also express the dependence of personal well-being on the judicial channeling of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. Perhaps, then, the iconographic clue to the meaning of Epa masks is not to be found in their elaborate superstructures, but in the crude pot helmet itself as a manifestation of the efficacy of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] for communal and personal well-being.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;

==Ritual Context==
In north-west [[Yorubaland]] the Epa masks are kept by the head of a lineage or a town chief on behalf of the lineage or community. When in use they are choreographed as emerging from the bush, where they return once 
the festival is completed. Offerings may be made to a mask before it is used or during the ceremony. According to Robert Thompson, 'the Epa cult stresses the transformation of young men into stalwart specimens 
able to bear pain and shoulder heavy weight'.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert F.|title=African Art in Motion|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles and Berkeley|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Arowolo of lloro distinguished between the type of energy belonging to the cult of [[Elefon]], concerned with ancestral spirits, and the cult of Epa, connected with the dignified, slow and patient masquerades of ancient men and culture heroes.&lt;ref name=Heyden&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heyden|first=M.V.|title=The Epa mask and ceremony|journal=African Arts X|year=1977|volume=2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]] Yoruba share their principal deities with Yoruba from elsewhere, they also have many deities and masquerades  peculiar to themselves, leading other fieldworkers to note that the distinction is less clear than Thompson suggested.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; In north-eastern Yorubaland, Epa and other masks are used in annual ceremonies, held in February or March in some places or as late as September in others to promote the fertility and well-being of the community.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; They also appear in Elefon festivals performed to celebrate the return of the warriors, to honor [[Ogoun|Ogun]], the god of war and iron and to mark the growth of new crops. Elsewhere such masks were used in post-burial rites relating to titled men. In one fairly consistent episode in the festival the masquerader, supporting a mask which can often weigh 50&amp;nbsp;lbs or more, attempts to jump off a mound to augur the quality of the new year. A fall or loss of balance is read as a bad omen which may herald coming misfortune.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;

==Epa Masquerade==
Early writers interpreted Epa ceremonies as entirely focused on fertility.&lt;ref name="Fagg &amp; Eliosofson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagg|first=W. &amp; E. Eliosofson|title=The Sculpture of Africa|year=1958|publisher=Thames &amp;  Hudson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have found the ceremonies to be equally concerned with warriors and the medicine God [[Osanyin]], relating them to both physical and spiritual security.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyden /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=K|title=Yoruba Religious Carving: Pagan and Christian Sculpture in Nigeria and Dahomey|year=1967|publisher=: Geoffrev Chapma|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ojo,&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; following Carroll,&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt; has proposed that at one level the ceremonies incorporate the re-enactment of historical events. In a ceremony recorded by Heyden in [[Ekiti State|lloro, Ekiti]], masks surmounted by female figures were identified as the wives of the warrior [[Okotorojo]], represented by an animal mask resembling a goat or antelope. Okotorojo, the principal figure in the festival, was chained to another man described as either having the duty to restrain the wild powers of the warrior or, paradoxically, as the representative of the power ([[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]) of [[Eleda]], who always remains behind the warrior to render him invincible in battle.&lt;ref name=Heyden /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">'''Georg Zappert''' (7 December 1806 in [[Óbuda]] &amp;ndash; 23 November 1859 in [[Vienna]]) was a [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] historian and archaeologist.

The son of well-to-do parents, Zappert was educated at the Pest gymnasium and at the [[University of Vienna]]. He began the study of medicine, but relinquished it after renouncing Judaism for [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1829, then taking up theology. This too he was forced to abandon in the second year, owing to deafness caused by a severe illness; and after this disappointment, which he felt keenly, he devoted himself to what became his life-work, namely, the study of the [[Middle Ages]].

He led a retired life in Vienna. He foretold the time of his death to the minute three days before it occurred; there have been in his family several cases of similar premonition. The [[Imperial Academy of Sciences]] elected him corresponding member on July 28, 1851.

Zappert published: "Gravure en Bois du XII. Siècle" (Vienna, 1837 et seq.); "Vita B. Petri Acotanti" (ib. 1839); and the following memoirs: "Ueber Antiquitätenfunde im Mittelalter" (in "Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften," Nov., 1850); "Epiphania, ein Beitrag zur-Christlichen Kunstarchäologie" (ib. xxi. 291-372); "Ueber Badewesen in Mittelalterlicher und Späterer Zeit" (in "Archiv für Kunde Oesterreichischer Geschichtsquellen," xxi. 5); "Ueber Sogenannte Verbrüderungsbücher in Nekrologien im Mittelalter" (in "Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften," x. 417-463, xi. 5-183); "Ueber ein für den Jugendunterricht des Kaisers Max I. Abgefasstes Lateinisches Gesprächsbüchlein" (ib. xxviii. 193-280); etc.

'''Halfdan Olaus Christophersen''' (13 December 1902 &amp;ndash; 27 May 1980) was a Norwegian historian, literature researcher and non-fiction writer.

==Personal life==
Christophersen was born at [[Drammen]]  in [[Buskerud]], Norway.  He was the son of Tollef Christophersen (1878–1949) and Emma Langager (1880–1962).
After graduating [[artium]] in [[Arendal]] in 1921 he began studying philology at the University of Kristiania.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Career==
Christophersen attended [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]] at [[Oxford University]] under a [[Norway Scholarship|Norwegian Oxford Scholorship]]. His doctorate thesis at [[Wadham College, Oxford]] was a treatment of [[John Locke]] (''A Bibliographical Introduction to the Study of John Locke'' 1932). 
Christophersen became a [[Rockefeller Fellow]] in 1932 and was able to visit universities in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[Netherlands]] before finishing at [[Stanford University]] in [[California]].

From 1936 he became engaged as Secretary at the [[Institute of Higher International Studies]] (''Institut des hautes études internationales'')  in [[Paris]]. From  1940 Christophersen was a member of the  [[Chr. Michelsen Institute]] in Bergen, Norway.

During the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]] he was a central member of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]]. From late 1944 he lived undercover as an active member of ''Hjemmefrontens Ledelse''. After [[World War II]], he served as director of the Department of Information Science and Media Studies at the [[University of Bergen]] (1946-1954).&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Halfdan Olaus Christophersen |first= |last= |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/Halfdan_Olaus_Christophersen |language=Norwegian|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was editor of the three volumes of ''Den store krigen'', published from 1946 to 1949. Among his other works are biographies of [[Marcus Jacob Monrad]], [[Eilert Sundt]] and [[Niels Treschow]]. He wrote several books on the history of travelling and tourism, and World War II memoirs ''Fra nød til seir''.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Halfdan Olaus Christophersen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Hans Fredrik |last=Dahl |authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Halfdan_Olaus_Christophersen/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugo Grotius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|oʊ|ʃ|i|ə|s}}; 10 April 1583&amp;nbsp;– 28 August 1645), also known as '''Huig de Groot''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɦœyɣ də ɣroːt|lang}}) or '''Hugo de Groot''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɦyɣoː də ɣroːt|lang}}), was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[jurist]]. Along with the earlier works of [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Alberico Gentili]], Grotius laid the foundations for [[international law]], based on [[natural law]]. A teenage intellectual prodigy, he was imprisoned for his involvement in the intra-[[Calvinist]] disputes of the Dutch Republic, but escaped hidden in a chest of books. He wrote most of his major works in exile in [[France]].

It is thought that Hugo Grotius was not the first to formulate the international society doctrine, but he was one of the first to define expressly the idea of one society of states, governed not by [[force]] or [[warfare]] but by actual laws and mutual agreement to enforce those laws. As [[Hedley Bull]] declared in 1990: "The idea of international society which Grotius propounded was given concrete expression in the [[Peace of Westphalia]], and Grotius may be considered the intellectual father of this first general peace settlement of modern times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Hedley Bull|editor2=[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]]|editor3=Benedict Kingsbury)|title=Hugo Grotius and International Relations|place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=0-19-825569-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--page(s)--&gt;

Additionally, his contributions to [[Arminian]] [[theology]] helped provide the seeds for later Arminian-based movements, such as [[Methodism]] and [[Pentecostalism]], and he is acknowledged as a significant figure in the Arminianism–Calvinism debate. Because of his theological underpinning of free trade, he is also considered an "economic theologist".&lt;ref&gt;Thumfart (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Hugo Grotius00.jpg|thumb|Grotius at age 16, by [[Jan Antonisz. van Ravesteyn]], 1599]]

Born in [[Delft]] during the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch Revolt]], Hugo was the first child of Jan de Groot and Alida van Overschie. His father was a man of learning, once having studied with the eminent [[Justus Lipsius]] at [[Leiden]], as well as of political distinction, and he groomed his son from an early age in a traditional [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] education. A [[child prodigy|prodigious]] learner, Hugo entered the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]] when he was just eleven years old. There he studied with some of the most acclaimed intellectuals in northern Europe, including [[Franciscus Junius (the elder)|Franciscus Junius]], [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]], and [[Rudolph Snellius]].&lt;ref&gt;See Vreeland (1919), chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

At age sixteen he published his first book: a scholarly edition of the [[late antiquity|late antique]] author [[Martianus Capella]]'s work on the [[seven liberal arts]], ''Martiani Minei Felicis Capellæ Carthaginiensis viri proconsularis Satyricon, in quo De nuptiis Philologiæ &amp; Mercurij libri duo, &amp; De septem artibus liberalibus libri singulares. Omnes, &amp; emendati, &amp; Notis, siue Februis Hug. Grotii illustrati'' [The Satyricon by Martianus Minneus Felix Capella, a man from Carthage, which includes the two books of 'On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury', and the book named 'On the Seven Liberal Arts'. Everything, including corrections, annotations as well as deletions and illustrations by Hug. Grotius].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stahl | first1 = William H. | year = 1965 | title = To a Better Understanding of Martianus Capella | url = | journal = Speculum | volume = 40 | issue = | page = 104 | doi=10.2307/2856467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Holland, Grotius earned an appointment as advocate to [[The Hague]] in 1599 and then as official [[historiographer]] for the States of Holland in 1601. His first occasion to write systematically on issues of international justice came in 1604, when he became involved in the legal proceedings following the seizure by Dutch merchants of a Portuguese [[carrack]] and its cargo in the [[Singapore Strait]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tititudorancea.com/z/hugo_grotius_18.htm|title=Hugo Grotius|website=www.tititudorancea.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''De Indis'' and ''Mare Liberum''==
[[File:Grotius de iure praedae.jpg|thumb|upright|Page written in Grotius' hand from the manuscript of ''De Indis'' (circa 1604/05)]]

The Dutch were at [[Eighty Years' War|war with Spain]] and [[Portugal]] when the loaded merchant ship ''[[Santa Catarina (ship)|Santa Catarina]]'', a Portuguese [[carrack]], was captured by captain [[Jacob van Heemskerk]] off present-day Singapore in 1603.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Heemskerk was employed with the United Amsterdam Company (part of the [[Dutch East India Company]]), and though he did not have authorization from the company or the government to initiate the use of force, many shareholders were eager to accept the riches that he brought back to them.&lt;ref name="See Ittersum 2006, chapter 1"&gt;See Ittersum (2006), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only was the legality of keeping the [[prize (law)|prize]] questionable under Dutch statute, but a faction of shareholders (mostly [[Mennonite]]) in the Company also objected to the forceful seizure on moral grounds, and of course, the Portuguese demanded the return of their cargo. The scandal led to a public judicial hearing and a wider campaign to sway public (and international) opinion. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} It was in this wider context that representatives of the Company called upon Grotius to draft a [[polemic]]al defence of the seizure.&lt;ref name="See Ittersum 2006, chapter 1" /&gt;

[[File:Mierevelt grotius 1608.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Grotius at age 25 ([[Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt]], 1608)]]

The result of Grotius' efforts in 1604/05 was a long, theory-laden treatise that he provisionally entitled ''De Indis'' (''On the Indies''). Grotius sought to ground his defense of the seizure in terms of the natural principles of justice. In this, he had cast a net much wider than the case at hand; his interest was in the source and ground of war's lawfulness in general. The treatise was never published in full during Grotius' lifetime, perhaps because the court ruling in favor of the Company preempted the need to garner public support.{{citation needed|reason=any source?|date=June 2015}}

In ''The Free Sea'' (''[[Mare Liberum]]'', published 1609) Grotius formulated the new principle that the sea was international territory and all [[nation]]s were free to use it for seafaring [[trade]]. Grotius, by claiming 'free seas' ([[Freedom of the seas]]), provided suitable ideological justification for the Dutch breaking up of various trade [[monopoly|monopolies]] through its formidable naval power (and then establishing its own monopoly). {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} [[England]], competing fiercely with the Dutch for domination of world trade, opposed this idea and claimed ''That the Dominion of the British Sea, or That Which Incompasseth the Isle of Great Britain, is, and Ever Hath Been, a Part or Appendant of the Empire of that Island.''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Selden|Selden, John]].

==Arminian controversy, arrest and exile==
{{Further|History of Calvinist–Arminian debate}} {{details|Ordinum Hollandiae ac Westfrisiae pietas}}
{{Arminianism}}
{{Five Articles}}

Aided by his continued association with [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt|Van Oldenbarnevelt]], Grotius made considerable advances in his political career, being retained as Oldenbarnevelt's resident advisor in 1605, Advocate General of the [[Fisc]] of [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]] and [[Friesland]] in 1607, and then as [[Pensionary]] of [[Rotterdam]] (the equivalent of a mayoral office) in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;Vreeland (1919), chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1608 he married Maria van Reigersbergen, with whom he would have eight children (four surviving beyond youth) and who would be invaluable in helping him and the family to weather the storm to come.

In these years a great [[theology|theological]] controversy broke out between the chair of theology at Leiden [[Jacobus Arminius]] and his followers (who are called Arminians or [[Remonstrants]]) and the strongly [[Calvinist]] theologian, [[Franciscus Gomarus]] whose supporters are termed Gomarists or Counter-Remonstrants. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Leiden University "was under the authority of the States of Holland&amp;nbsp;– they were responsible, among other things, for the policy concerning appointments at this institution, which was governed in their name by a board of Curators&amp;nbsp;– and, in the final instance, the States were responsible for dealing with any cases of heterodoxy among the professors."&lt;ref name="Rabbie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hugo Grotius: Ordinum Hollandiae ac Westfrisiae Pietas, 1613.|author=Edwin Rabbie|year=1995|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The domestic dissension resulting over Arminius' professorship was overshadowed by the continuing war with Spain, and the professor died in 1609 on the eve of the [[Twelve Years' Truce]]. The new peace would move the people's focus to the controversy and Arminius' followers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Controversy within Dutch Protestantism===
The controversy expanded when the Remonstrant theologian [[Conrad Vorstius]] was appointed to replace Jacobus Arminius as the theology chair at Leiden. Vorstius was soon seen by Counter-Remonstrants as moving beyond the teachings of Arminius into [[Socinianism]] and he was accused of teaching irreligion. Leading the call for Vorstius' removal was theology professor [[Sibrandus Lubbertus]]. On the other side [[Johannes Wtenbogaert]] (a Remonstrant leader) and [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], Grand Pensionary of Holland had strongly promoted the appointment of Vortius and began to defend their actions. Gomarus resigned his professorship at Leyden, in protest that Vorstius was not removed.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Counter-Remonstrants were also supported in their opposition by King [[James I of England]]{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} "who thundered loudly against the Leyden nomination and gaudily depicted Vorstius as a horrid heretic. He ordered his books to be publicly burnt in London, Cambridge, and Oxford, and he exerted continual pressure through his ambassador in the Hague, Ralph Winwood, to get the appointment cancelled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecclesia reformata: Studies on the Reformation|author=Willem Nijenhuis|location=Leiden, Netherlands|publisher=Brill|date=1972–1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; James began to shift his confidence from Oldenbarnevelt towards Maurice.

Grotius joined the controversy by defending the civil authorities' power to appoint (independently of the wishes of religious authorities) whomever they wished to a university's faculty. He did this by writing ''[[Ordinum Pietas]]'', "a pamphlet...directed against an opponent, the Calvinist Franeker professor Lubbertus; it was ordered by Grotius' masters the States of Holland, and thus written for the occasion&amp;nbsp;– though Grotius may already have had plans for such a book."&lt;ref name="De Imperio"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hugo Grotius Theologian – Essays in Honor of G.H.M. Posthumus Meyjes|editor=Henk J.M. Nellen &amp; Edwin Rabbie|article=''De Imperio Summarum Potestatum Circa Sacra''|author= Harm-Jan Van Dam|publisher=E.J. Brill|year=1994|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is twenty-seven pages long, is "polemical and acrimonious" and only two-thirds of it speaks directly about ecclesiastical politics (mainly of synods and offices).&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt; The work met with a violent reaction from the Counter-Remonstrants, and "It might be said that all Grotius' next works until his arrest in 1618 form a vain attempt to repair the damage done by this book."&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt; Grotius would later write ''De Satisfactione'' aiming "at proving that the Arminians are far from being Socinians."&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt;

===''Decretum pro pace ecclesiarum'' (1613–14)===
Led by Oldenbarnevelt, the [[States of Holland]] took an official position of [[religious toleration]] towards Remonstrants and Counter-Remonstrants. Grotius, (who acted during the controversy first as Attorney General of Holland, and later as a member of the Committee of Counsellors) was eventually asked to draft an edict to express the policy of toleration.&lt;ref&gt;A translation edict is printed in full in the appendix to Vreeland (1919).&lt;/ref&gt; This edict, ''Decretum pro pace ecclesiarum'' was completed in late 1613 or early 1614. The edict put into practice a view that Grotius had been developing in his writings on [[separation of church and state|church and state]] (see [[Erastianism]]): that only the basic tenets necessary for undergirding civil order (e.g., the existence of God and His [[divine providence|providence]]) ought to be enforced while differences on obscure theological doctrines should be left to private conscience.&lt;ref&gt;See his manuscript for ''Meletius'' (1611) and the more systematic ''De imperio summarum potestatum circa sacra'' (finished 1617, published 1647).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statue of Hugo Grotius.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue of Hugo Grotius in [[Delft]], the Netherlands]]

The edict "imposing moderation and toleration on the ministry", was backed up by Grotius with "thirty-one pages of quotations, mainly dealing with the Five Remonstrant Articles."&lt;ref name="De Imperio"/&gt; In response to Grotius' ''Ordinum Pietas'', Professor Lubbertus published ''Responsio Ad Pietatem Hugonis Grotii'' in 1614. Later that year Grotius anonymously published ''Bona Fides Sibrandi Lubberti'' in response to Lubbertus.&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt;

[[Jacobus Trigland]] joined Lubberdus in expressing the view that tolerance in matters of doctrine was inadmissible, and in his 1615 works ''Den Recht-gematigden Christen: Ofte vande waere Moderatie'' and ''Advys Over een Concept van moderatie''&lt;ref name="Property"&gt;{{cite book|title=Property, Piracy and Punishment: Hugo Grotius on War and Booty in De iure praedae|editor=Hans W. Blom|publisher=Brill|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trigland denounced Grotius' stance.

It is generally assumed that Grotius first propounded the principle of [[freedom of the seas]], although all countries in the [[Indian Ocean]] and other Asian seas accepted the right of [[Freedom of navigation|unobstructed navigation]] long before Grotius wrote his ''De Jure Praedae'' (''On the Law of Spoils'') in the year of 1604. Additionally, 16th century Spanish theologian [[Francisco de Vitoria]] had postulated the idea of freedom of the seas in a more rudimentary fashion under the principles of ''[[jus gentium]]''.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1947"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Nussbaum|title=A concise history of the law of nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxkQAQAAMAAJ|year=1947|publisher=Macmillan Co.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grotius's notion of the freedom of the seas would persist until the mid-twentieth century, and it continues to be applied even to this day for much of the [[high seas]], though the application of the concept and the scope of its reach is changing.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In late 1615, when Middelburg professor [[Antonius Walaeus]] published ''Het Ampt der Kerckendienaren'' (a response to [[Johannes Wtenbogaert]]'s 1610 ''Tractaet van 't Ampt ende authoriteit eener hoogher Christelijcke overheid in kerckelijkcke zaken'') he sent Grotius a copy out of friendship. This was a work "on the relationship between ecclesiastical and secular government" from the moderate counter-remonstrant viewpoint.&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt; In early 1616 Grotius also received the 36 page letter championing a remonstrant view ''Dissertatio epistolica de Iure magistratus in rebus ecclesiasticis'' from his friend [[Gerardus Vossius]].&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt;

The letter was "a general introduction on (in)tolerance, mainly on the subject of predestination and the sacrament...[and] an extensive, detailed and generally unfavourable review of Walaeus' ''Ampt'', stuffed with references to ancient and modern authorities."&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt; When Grotius wrote asking for some notes "he received a treasure-house of ecclesiastical history. ...offering ammunition to Grotius, who gratefully accepted it".&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt; Around this time (April 1616) Grotius went to Amsterdam as part of his official duties, trying to persuade the civil authorities there to join Holland's majority view about church politics.

In early 1617 Grotius debated the question of giving counter-remonstrants the chance to preach in the [[Kloosterkerk, The Hague|Kloosterkerk in The Hague]] which had been closed. During this time lawsuits were brought against the States of Holland by counter-remonstrant ministers and riots over the controversy broke out in Amsterdam.

===''De Imperio Summarum Potestatum circa Sacra''===
[[File:Slot loevestein 1619.jpg|thumb|[[Loevestein]] Castle at the time of Grotius' imprisonment in 1618–21]]

As the conflict between civil and religious authorities escalated, in order to maintain civil order Oldenbarnevelt eventually proposed that local authorities be given the power to raise troops (the [[Sharp Resolution]] of August 4, 1617). Such a measure putatively undermined the authority of the [[stadtholder]] of the republic, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Maurice seized the opportunity to solidify the preeminence of the [[Gomarist]]s, whom he had supported, and to eliminate the nuisance he perceived in Oldenbarnevelt (the latter had previously brokered the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] with Spain in 1609 against Maurice's wishes). During this time Grotius made another attempt to address ecclesiastical politics by completing ''De Imperio Summarum Potestatum circa Sacra'', on "the relations between the religious and secular authorities...Grotius had even cherished hopes that publication of this book would turn the tide and bring back peace to church and state".&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt;

[[File:Fredrik-Duim-De-vlugt-van-Huig-de-Groot MG 1299.tif|thumb|left|upright|Grotius' escape from [[Loevestein]] Castle in 1621]]

As the religious dispute between the Remonstrants and the Counter-Remonstrants became increasingly heated during the Twelve Years’ Truce (1609–1621), riots broke out.   A national synod, the Synod of Dort, was convened to settle the dispute and in 1619, it outlawed Arminianism. Remonstrant members of the States of Holland including Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius were immediately arrested and imprisoned. After half a year in remand, sentences were passed. Van Oldenbarnevelt was sentenced to death and was beheaded in 1619. Grotius was controversially sentenced to life imprisonment and transferred to Loevestein Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.slotloevestein.nl/en/history/hugo-grotius/ |newspaper=Slot Loevestein|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his imprisonment in Loevestein, Grotius made a written justification of his position "as to my views on the power of the Christian [civil] authorities in ecclesiastical matters, I refer to my...booklet ''De Pietate Ordinum Hollandiae'' and especially to an unpublished book ''De Imperio summarum potestatum circa sacra'', where I have treated the matter in more detail...I may summarize my feelings thus: that the [civil] authorities should scrutinize God's Word so thoroughly as to be certain to impose nothing which is against it; if they act in this way, they shall in good conscience have control of the public churches and public worship&amp;nbsp;– but without persecuting those who err from the right way."&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt; Because this stripped Church officials of any power some of their members (such as [[Johannes Althusius]] in a letter to Lubbertus) declared Grotius' ideas diabolical.&lt;ref name="De Imperio" /&gt;

[[File:WLANL - Pachango - Slot Loevestein - Boekenkist van Hugo de Groot.jpg|thumb|The book chest in which Grotius escaped [[Loevestein]] in 1621]]

In 1621, with the help of his wife and his maidservant, [[Elsje van Houwening]], Grotius managed to escape the castle in a book chest and fled to [[Paris]]. In the Netherlands today, he is mainly famous for this daring escape. Both the [[Rijksmuseum]] in [[Amsterdam]] and the museum [[Prinsenhof|Het Prinsenhof]] in Delft claim to have the original book chest in their collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.slotloevestein.nl/geschiedenis/hugo-de-groot|title=Hugo de Groot - Slot Loevestein|newspaper=Slot Loevestein|language=nl-NL|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grotius was well received in Paris by his former acquaintances and was granted a royal pension under [[Louis XIII]]. It was there in France that Grotius completed his most famous philosophical works.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==''On The Truth of the Christian Religion''==
While in Paris, Grotius set about rendering into Latin prose a work which he had originally written as Dutch verse in prison, providing rudimentary yet systematic arguments for the truth of Christianity. The Dutch poem, ''Bewijs van den waren Godsdienst'', was published in 1622, the Latin treatise in 1627, under the title ''De veritate religionis Christianae''.

===Governmental theory of atonement===
Grotius also developed a particular view of the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of Christ known as the "[[Atonement (Governmental view)|Governmental]]" or "Moral government" theory. He theorized that Jesus' sacrificial death occurred in order for the Father to forgive while still maintaining his just rule over the universe. This idea, further developed by theologians such as [[John Miley]], became one of the prominent views of the atonement in [[Methodist]] [[Arminianism]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==''De Jure Belli ac Pacis''==
{{Main|De jure belli ac pacis}}
[[File:381px-Grotius de jure 1631.jpg|thumb|Title page from the second edition (Amsterdam 1631) of ''De jure belli ac pacis'']]

Living in the times of the [[Eighty Years' War]] between [[Spain]] and the Netherlands and the [[Thirty Years' War]] between Catholic and Protestant European nations (Catholic France being in the otherwise Protestant camp), it is not surprising that Grotius was deeply concerned with matters of conflicts between nations and religions. His most lasting work, begun in prison and published during his exile in Paris, was a monumental effort to restrain such conflicts on the basis of a broad moral consensus. Grotius wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fully convinced...that there is a common law among nations, which is valid alike for war and in war, I have had many and weighty reasons for undertaking to write upon the subject. Throughout the Christian world I observed a lack of restraint in relation to war, such as even barbarous races should be ashamed of; I observed that men rush to arms for slight causes, or no cause at all, and that when arms have once been taken up there is no longer any respect for law, divine or human; it is as if, in accordance with a general decree, frenzy had openly been let loose for the committing of all crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of War and Peace'', trans. Francis Kelsey (Carnegie edition, 1925), Prol. sect. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[De jure belli ac pacis libri tres]]'' (''On the Law of War and Peace: Three books'') was first published in 1625, dedicated to Grotius' current patron, Louis XIII. The treatise advances a system of principles of natural law, which are held to be binding on all people and nations regardless of local custom. The work is divided into three books:
* Book I advances his conception of [[Philosophy of war|war]] and of natural [[justice]], arguing that there are some circumstances in which war is justifiable.
* Book II identifies three 'just causes' for war: [[self-defense]], [[restitution|reparation of injury]], and [[punishment]]; Grotius considers a wide variety of circumstances under which these rights of war attach and when they do not.
* Book III takes up the question of what rules govern the conduct of war once it has begun; influentially, Grotius argued that all parties to war are bound by such rules, whether their cause is just or not.

==Natural law==
[[File:Hugo-de-Groot-Johann-Niclas-Serlin-Drey-Bücher-von-Kriegs-und-Friedens-Rechten 0157.tif|left|thumb|Engraved portrait of Grotius]]

Grotius' concept of natural law had a strong impact on the philosophical and theological debates and political developments of the 17th and 18th centuries. Among those he influenced were [[Samuel Pufendorf]] and [[John Locke]], and by way of these philosophers his thinking became part of the cultural background of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England and the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Jeremy Waldron]] (2002), ''God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations in Locke's Political Thought'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (UK), {{ISBN|978-0-521-89057-1}}, pp. 189, 208&lt;/ref&gt; In Grotius' understanding, [[nature]] was not an entity in itself, but God's [[creationism|creation]]. Therefore, his concept of natural law had a theological foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Wolf, ''Naturrecht'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band IV (1960), Tübingen (Germany), col. 1357&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Testament]] contained moral precepts (e.g. the [[Decalogue]]), which [[Christ]] confirmed and therefore were still valid. They were useful in interpreting the content of natural law. Both biblical [[revelation]] and natural law originated in God and could therefore not contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;M. Elze, ''Grotius, Hugo'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band II (1958), Tübingen (Germany), col. 1885&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Many exiled Remonstrants began to return to the Netherlands after the death of Prince Maurice in 1625 when toleration was granted to them. In 1630 they were allowed complete freedom to build and run churches and schools and to live anywhere in Holland. The Remonstrants guided by Uytenbogaert set up a presbyterial organization. They established a theological seminary at Amsterdam where Grotius came to teach alongside Episcopius, Limborch, Curcellaeus, and Le Clerc.

In 1634 Grotius was given the opportunity to serve as [[Sweden]]'s ambassador to [[France]]. The recently deceased Swedish king, [[Gustavus Adolphus]] had been an admirer of Grotius (he was said to have always carried a copy of ''De jure belli ac pacis'' in his saddle when leading his troops).&lt;ref&gt;Grotius, Hugo ''The Rights of War and Peace'' Book I, Introduction by Tuck, Richard: Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; His successor's regent, [[Axel Oxenstierna]], was keen to have Grotius in his employ. Grotius accepted the offer and took up [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] residence in Paris, which remained his home until he was released from his post in 1645.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

While departing from his last visit to Sweden, Grotius was [[shipwreck]]ed on the voyage. He washed up on the shore of [[Rostock]], ill and weather-beaten, and on August 28, 1645, he died; his body at last returned to the country of his youth, being laid to rest in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Delft)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in Delft.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Hug. Grotii Bataui Syntagma Arateorum 981373 00009.jpg|thumb|''Syntagma Arateorum'']]

Grotius' personal motto was ''Ruit hora'' ("Time is running away"); his last words were "By understanding many things, I have accomplished nothing" (''Door veel te begrijpen, heb ik niets bereikt'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/grotius.html Bill Uzgalis, "Hugo Grotius" in Western Philosophers, Oregon State online notes (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020053039/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/grotius.html |date=20 October 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant friends and acquaintances of his included the theologian [[Franciscus Junius (the elder)|Franciscus Junius]], the poet [[Daniel Heinsius]], the philologist [[Gerhard Johann Vossius]], the historian [[Johannes Meursius]], the engineer [[Simon Stevin]], the historian [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]], and the Orientalist and Arabic scholar [[Thomas van Erpe|Erpinius]]. He was also friends with the Flemish [[Jesuit]] [[Andreas Schottus]].&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume H.M. Posthumus Meyjes (ed.), ''Hugo Grotius,'' Meletius sive De iis quae inter Christianos conveniunt Epistola'': Critical Edition with Translation, Commentary and Introduction'', Brill 1988, p. 33, n. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Grotius was the father of regent and diplomat [[Pieter de Groot]].

==Commentary on Grotius==
[[q:Andrew Dickson White|Andrew Dickson White]] wrote in [https://books.google.com/books?id=8VA9AAAAYAAJ&amp; ''Seven Great Statesmen in the Warfare of Humanity with Unreason''] (1910):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Into the very midst of all this welter of evil, at a point in time to all appearance hopeless, at a point in space apparently defenseless, in a nation of which every man, woman, and child was under sentence of death from its sovereign, was born a man who wrought as no other has ever done for a redemption of civilization from the main cause of all that misery; who thought out for Europe the precepts of right reason in international law; who made them heard; who gave a noble change to the course of human affairs; whose thoughts, reasonings, suggestions, and appeals produced an environment in which came an evolution of humanity that still continues.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast, [[Robert A. Heinlein]] satirized the Grotian [[governmental theory of atonement|governmental]] approach to theology in ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'': "There is an old, old story about a theologian who was asked to reconcile the [[doctrine]] of [[Divine Mercy]] with the doctrine of [[original sin|infant damnation]]. 'The Almighty,' he explained, 'finds it [[predeterminism|necessary]] to do things in His official and public capacity which in His private and personal capacity He deplores.'"&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Heinlein (1958/1999), ''Revolt in 2100 &amp; Methuselah's Children'', reprint, Riverdale, New York: Baen, Chapter 3, pp. 324–325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Osgood Bradley Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; was Surveyor, Historian and Trustee of the ''Historical Society of Rosario'', author of numerous articles and essays.

He was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rosario biográfico". Authors: Gómez, Marcos Sastre, Cístola. Editora Tradiciones Argentinas. Rosario, 1955. Printed by Talleres Gráficos Cístola S.R.L. Rioja 866, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Technical Advisor to the ''Comisión Nacional del Río Dulce'', Montes oversaw tech-specs pertaining to the mega project for hydroelectric power development in [[Santiago del Estero]], Argentina. Juan A. Montes was also involved -from 1948 until 1956- in planning the ''Ciudad Universitaria'' a modern campus-complex for the [[Universidad Nacional del Litoral]] in [[Rosario]] and several major improvements compiled under a single work-project known as ''Plan Rosario''. In 1973 Juan A. Montes was appointed by Rector to the [[Universidad Tecnológica Nacional]] (UTN) by [[Héctor José Cámpora]], then president of Argentina. At the time Montes was closely affiliated to the left-wing of the Peronist known as [[Montoneros]]. His son, Roald, a [[Montonero]], was killed in what became known as the Battle of [[La Plata]] along with several other partisans in (November, 1976) during the first months of the military coup led by General [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. Juan A. Montes remained as Rector of the UTN throughout the third presidential period of [[Juan Domingo Perón]]. The events of 1976 led Juan A. Montes into a self-imposed exile in Rosario where he became involved in the research of the facts leading to the founding of the City Rosario, the results were later published under the title: ''Santiago Montenegro, fundador de la ciudad de Rosario''&lt;ref&gt;http://reocities.com/RainForest/wetlands/8064/MORETTO.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Alberto Montes died in [[Rosario]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], on June 30, 1986.

[[Image:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine.]]
The '''legacy of the Great Famine''' in [[Ireland]] ({{lang-ga|'''An Gorta Mór'''}}&lt;ref&gt;The term has appeared in the titles of numerous books on the event, as demonstrated by [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22Gorta+Mo%CC%81r%22&amp;=Search&amp;qt=results_page this search on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''An Drochshaol'', litt: ''The Bad Life'') followed a catastrophic period of Irish history between 1845 and 1852&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy (1995), xvi–ii.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the population of Ireland was reduced by 20 to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity, Gill &amp; Macmillan (1994), {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}, 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

The famine was a watershed in the [[history of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Its effects permanently changed the island's demographic, political and cultural landscape. For both the native Irish and those in the resulting [[Irish diaspora|diaspora]], the famine entered [[folk memory]]&lt;ref&gt;The Famine that affected Ireland from 1845 to 1852 has become an integral part of folk legend. Kenealy, ''This Great Calamity'', p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a rallying point for various [[Irish nationalism|nationalist movements]]. Modern historians regard it as a dividing line in the Irish [[historical narrative]], referring to the preceding period of Irish history as "pre-Famine."

==Political and Cultural Impact of the Famine==

===In Ireland===
Political reaction resulting from the [[Great Irish Famine]] was muted, because of the extremely limited [[electoral franchise]] that existed at the time. While [[Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Irish politics]] in the 1820s to 1840s had been dominated by the [[Catholic Emancipation]] and "Repeal" movements under [[Daniel O'Connell]], it was not until the 1880s under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], nearly forty years after the Famine, that a major [[Irish nationalist]] political movement, the [[Home Rule League]] (later known as the 'Parliamentary Party') appeared. Parnell was also instrumental in establishing the [[Irish Land League]], to achieve [[land reform]]. (The [[Independent Irish Party]], formed in June 1852, disintegrated within four years, but it was in major decline from 1853 when tenants benefited from a recovery in agricultural prices.)

Outside the mainstream, too, reaction was slow. The 1848 [[Young Ireland]] rebellion under [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]], though occurring at the start of the Famine, was hardly impacted upon ''by'' the Famine, as much as by the clash between the "constitutional" nationalism and [[Catholicism]] of O'Connell and the [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] [[Irish republicanism|republicanism]] of Davis. Another rebellion would not occur again until the 1860s under the [[Fenians]]/[[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]. Historians have speculated that, such was the economic and social impact on Ireland, the nation was numbed into inaction for decades afterwards; in other words, that politics mattered less to people than survival after the traumatic experiences of the late 1840s and early 1850s.

Though its electorate was a small part of the population (as elsewhere in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]), those Irish privileged to vote continued until the mid-1880s to vote for the two major British political parties, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], with more votes and seats going to the latter, even though it had been the party of government during the Famine. Because of the skewed franchise, a large body of voters continued to vote for [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]], who wished to maintain the Union that joined Britain and Ireland.

The British Royal Family avoided some censure, due to their perceived impotence in political affairs. Although some believed the myth that [[Queen Victoria]] (known in Ireland in later decades as the "Famine Queen") had only donated a miserly £5 to famine relief, in fact the sum was £2,000, the equivalent of £61,000 today, from her personal resources. She also was patron of a charity that fundraised. On instruction of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] Victoria made what was largely seen as a propaganda visit in 1849. However, this visit was conducted under stringent security measures and was not free from protests or controversy. The celebrations associated with her visit  just after the famine were compared to "illuminating a graveyard" in a newspaper editorial at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy, Christine (2000), Hidden Famine: Hunger, Poverty and [[Sectarianism]] in [[Belfast]], p.184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistic consequences===

It is estimated that one and a half million people died during the Famine and that a million emigrated between 1846 and 1851. A large proportion of these were Irish speakers, and the poorest districts, from which emigration continued to flow, were generally Irish-speaking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maureen Wall]], 'The Decline of the Irish Language,' p.87, in Ó Cuív, Brian (ed.) (1969), ''A View of the Irish Language'', Irish Stationery Office.&lt;/ref&gt; The Famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language (the general exclusion of Irish from public life and the influence of the English-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part) but it was a conspicuous element.&lt;ref&gt;Breandán Ó Madagáin (1974, 1980), ''An Ghaeilge in Luimneach 1700–1900'', pp. 14–22, An Clóchomhar Tta, {{ISBN|0-7171-0685-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of an Ireland which thought of itself as essentially English-speaking, though with a persistent and influential reaction in the form of organisations such as the [[Gaelic League]] and the growth of a network of urban [[Status of the Irish language|Irish-speaking activists]] from the late nineteenth century on.

In pre-Famine Ireland Irish was the language both of a rich folk culture and a strong literary tradition. The latter persisted in the form of [[Irish language]] manuscripts containing both prose and poetry: a single collection would give the reader access to a substantial part of the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Tomás de Bhaldraithe (ed.) (1970, 1973, 1976), ''Cín Lae Amhlaoibh'', p. xxvii, An Clóchomhar Tta, {{ISBN|0-7171-0512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ó Madagáin, pp. 29–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Many such manuscripts were taken to America by emigrants in the 1840s and after.

The emigration of numerous Irish speakers to America as an immediate or long-term result of the Famine led to a movement there for the maintenance of the Irish language. This was marked in part by the foundation of Philo-Celtic Societies and the founding of the monthly journal ''An Gaodhal'' in 1881, the first such publication anywhere in which Irish was extensively used.&lt;ref&gt;Breandán Ó Buachalla, ' ''An Gaodhal'' i Meiriceá,' pp. 38–56, in Stiofán Ó hAnnracháin (ed.) (1979), ''Go Meiriceá Siar'', An Clóchomhar Tta.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.H.A. Williams, 'Ceol na hÉireann agus amhráin na ndaoine sna Stáit Aontaithe,' pp. 68–84, in Ó hAnnracháin (ed.) (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish emigrants abroad===

If the political elite in Ireland remained tolerant of British political parties and the monarchy, emigrants were not so. Many Irish emigrants to the United States quickly associated with separatist republican groups and organisations like the IRB. The political liberties and freedom of opportunity they encountered in the States confirmed for them the potential of an independent Ireland and often made them more passionate and optimistic than some of their brethren at home.

The Famine and its causes became a major platform for emigrant anger, as it was the main cause for most of them being emigrants in the first place. [[John Mitchel]], a journalist by trade (who had written for Thomas Davis's newspaper, [[The Nation - Irish newspaper|''The Nation'']] before leaving to set up his own paper, only to be arrested, tried for [[sedition]] and [[Penal transportation|transported]] to the [[penal colony]] of [[Van Diemen's Land]]) proved to be a superb campaigner against British rule in Ireland. Analysing the famine, he wrote:

{{cquote|The Almighty indeed sent the potato blight but the English created the famine... a million and half men, women and children were carefully, prudently and peacefully slain by the English government. They died of hunger in the midst of abundance which their own hands created.&lt;ref&gt;John Mitchel, ''The Last Conquest of Ireland''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;John Mitchel&lt;/small&gt;}}

Mitchel's commentary expressed the anger felt by many emigrants, who saw themselves as the dispossessed, forced from Ireland by a famine they blamed on British government policies. The famine became a constant issue with [[Irish American]]s, who to an extent unrivalled among other emigrant communities in the United States, remained emotionally attached to their native land. Leaders such as [[John Devoy]] in later decades came to play a major role in supporting Irish independence. It was no accident that the [[President of Dáil Éireann]], [[Éamon de Valera]] in 1920 chose to travel to the United States, not elsewhere, in his efforts to get the [[Irish Republic]] recognised and accepted, or that when [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] launched special bonds to fund the new Republic, many were sold to Irish Americans.

==Suggestions of genocide==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
A claim was made by a US professor of law, [[Francis A. Boyle]] that the Famine was [[genocide]] by the British against the Irish, meaning that the famine was part of a deliberate policy of planned extermination.  One US historian, [[James Mullin (American law librarian)|James Mullin]], insists that what happened can be described as genocide, sometimes accusing other historians, statisticians and researchers who state otherwise of pushing a British point of view, or of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionism]], rewriting history to make excuses for [[British imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/68067 Americanchronicle.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However more US, British and Irish historians, such as Professors [[F.S.L. Lyons]], [[John A. Murphy]], [[R. F. Foster (historian)|Roy Foster]], and [[James S. Donnelly, Jr]], as well as historians [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], [[Peter Gray (historian)|Peter Gray]], [[Ruth Dudley Edwards]] and [[Cormac Ó Gráda]] have denied claims of a deliberate policy of genocide. All historians generally agree that British policies during the Famine (particularly those applied by the ministry of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]) were misguided, ill-informed and counter-productive, and that had a similar crisis occurred in England instead of Ireland then the government's response would have been very different.

The famine killed one million Irish through hunger and related diseases such as [[cholera]]. A million others emigrated during the famine, with millions more following them in the following decades. The vast majority of these people were [[Roman Catholic]], traditionally less inclined towards loyalty to the Crown. However, while it could easily be said that the famine and its after-effects ended conclusively any chance of Ireland ever being a military or economic threat to Britain again, it should be also noted that the famine's long term demographic effects were less the result of deaths from starvation (which, as with most famines, affected the old, the very young and the sick disproportionately) and more the result of emigration (which primarily affected the young population of reproductive age).

The historical evidence suggests that earlier Irish famines caused mortality of comparable magnitude to the famine of the 1840s. Some famines, in particular the [[Irish Famine (1740–41)|that of the early 1740s]], might have even killed a larger proportion of the Irish population compared to that of the mid-19th century. Nevertheless, after earlier famines the population recovered relatively quickly if only because most of the survivors did not have the resources to emigrate. By comparison, during the first half of the nineteenth century the real cost of a transatlantic voyage would fall to a point that by the 1840s even the poorest people could secure passage, albeit under wretched conditions. It seems virtually certain that economic factors alone would have caused considerable emigration from Ireland even without mass starvation. A comparison between the historical populations of [[Demographics of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Demographic history of Scotland|Scotland]] proves useful with regards to this point - even though Scotland has not experienced a catastrophic famine in the past two centuries, nevertheless, it has experienced steady emigration over that time, albeit on a slower and steadier pace compared to Ireland. As a result, while the population of Scotland surpassed that of Ireland around the beginning of the 20th century, by the end of the century the population of Ireland once again exceeded that of Scotland.

==Legacy of the Famine today==
[[File:Population of Ireland and Europe 1750 to 2005.svg|thumb|300px|right|A graph of the populations of Ireland and Europe indexed against 1750 showing the disastrous consequence of the [[Irish Potato Famine|1845–49 potato famine]].]]

Ireland commemorated the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine in the 1990s. It was a contrast, in many ways, with the 100th anniversary in the 1940s. Then, only a few commemorations were held—the most significant of which was a commissioned volume of Famine history edited by [[R. Dudley Edwards]] and [[T. Desmond Williams]] (though not published until 1956), and the 'Famine Survey' undertaken by the [[Irish Folklore Commission]] in 1945. The 1990s marked a significant shift in attitudes towards commemorating the Famine, as hundreds of events took place in Ireland and throughout the Irish diaspora, some of which received sponsorship from the [[National Famine Commemoration Committee]] based in the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], led by [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Avril Doyle]]. At the Great Famine Event held in [[Millstreet]], a statement from [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] was read aloud, apologising for the failure of past British governments to adequately address the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]] ''Blair says sorry for Britain's 'failure' in the Irish famine'' 2 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A large amount of new famine studies were produced, many detailing for the first time local experiences. Historians re-examined all aspects of the Famine experience; from practical issues like the number of deaths and emigrants, to the long-term impact it had on society, sexual behaviour, land holdings, [[property rights]] and the entire Irish identity. In 2010 Britain failed to send a diplomatic representative to the opening of the National Famine Commemoration, while 14 other nations did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/british-fail-to-attend-famine-ceremony-2182551.html Independent.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Famine in song==
The Famine is also commemorated in song, both from the period and from modern times. Irish novelist and songwriter, [[Brendan Graham]] has written a number of novels and songs on '''An Gorta Mor – the Great Irish Famine'''. His book publishing deal with [[Harper Collins]] originated from a number of songs he had written about An Gorta Mor, resulting in the publication of his best selling 'documentary novel' of the Famine – '''The Whitest Flower''' (HarperCollins, London, Sydney, Toronto, 1998). The Sunday Times, Canberra called The Whitest Flower – 'An important addition to the Irish national story'. The Whitest Flower, with its song 'soundtrack', was a required text for Boston's MIT Women's Studies Course. Along with its sequel '''The Element of Fire''' (HarperCollins, 2001), The Whitest Flower was also listed as 'support fiction' for Ireland's Leaving Certificate, History syllabus.

"'''[[The Voice (Eimear Quinn song)|The Voice]]'''" written by [[Brendan Graham]] and performed by Eimear Quinn won the 1996 [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for Ireland. The lyrics refer to Ireland's troubled history and point clearly to Famine times in Ireland, ''I am The Voice of your hunger and pain''.

As well as entering the British Pop Charts, The Voice was one of the songs studied for the UK GCSE Music Syllabus, 1998. Eimear Quinn's version featured in the [[Pierce Brosnan]] movie – The Nephew, while the song found a new life in America with the recording and widespread PBS broadcasting of it as part of the group Celtic Woman's rise to prominence there.  Author and sociologist E. Moore Quinn in her book 'Irish American Folklore in New England', published in 2009, quotes the full lyric of The Voice.

'''"The Fairhaired Boy"''' – This song written by [[Brendan Graham]] was recorded by Cathy Jordan and [[Dervish]] on their 2003 album, 'Spirit'. Carmel Conway also recorded the song on her 2009 album 'This Beautiful Day'. It is also performed in the 'Cois Tine – Stories of Liam O' Flaherty' – by singer and violinist Fionnuala Howard. A song of emigration from Ireland during Famine times, The Fairhaired Boy tells of the sorrow of parting – 'Soon you'll in California be or Colorado bound'. In The Whitest Flower, Graham's heroine Ellen sings the song to Roberteen, a young neighbour from Ireland whom she finds dying in the lazaretto (fever shed) at Canada's Quarantine Island of Grosse Ile. The song is written in a traditional narrative style song form where there are no choruses, the hook of the song being contained in the last line of each stanza with the pull of the story being used to keep the listener's interest alive.

'''"Crucán na bPáiste"''' – 'the burial place of (unbaptised) children' – lies on a hilltop in Maamtrasna, Co.Mayo, overlooking Lough Nafooey, and Lough Mask in Ireland. It is a lament by a mother for a child she buries there during Aimsir an Drochshaoil ('The Time of the Bad Life' – the Famine). The song was written by Graham for Ellen Rua, one of the characters in his second novel,  '''The Brightest Day, The Darkest Night''', also published by Harper Collins. It has been recorded and performed by a number of artistes most notably [[Karen Matheson]] (as part of the Transatlantic Sessions), Cathy Jordan of Dervish and Eimear Quinn. Graham reveals the story of how the song came to be written in his Sunday Miscellany radio piece for RTÉ, called ''Effin' Songs'', recorded live in Ireland's National Concert Hall, with Eimear Quinn and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and piper Neil Martin, following with the song itself.

''"Crucán na bPáiste had become a claw in my gut – and my pilgrimage. Over many months it inched out in me its cry...focal by focal...line by line...until I was set free and it had found its epiphany. I had learned to keep out of the way...let the song write itself. This, I suppose is the real answer to the question with which we started. The truly special songs write us...we don't write them; we don't find them...they find us"''.

Another of Graham's Famine songs, '''"Ochón an Gorta Mor / Lament of the Great Hunger"''', was commissioned by the Irish Government, as part of the Ceól Reoite (Frozen Music – after Goethe's 'Architecture is frozen music') Millennial Project. Fourteen Irish composers were asked to pick a monument of national significance and to write a piece of music/song which would release from it the music frozen within. Graham chose the Curvilinear Glasshouses at Dublin's National Botanic Gardens, constructed at the time of An Gorta Mor, by monies diverted from research to find a cure for the potato blight afflicting Ireland. The glasshouses looked down over the Gardens' 'vegetable patch', where the blight was first discovered in Ireland in August 1845. Graham has described the 'frozen music' locked within the architecture of the Curvilinear Glasshouses as 'a lament for a famished people'. A song for unaccompanied voice it has been recorded by Róisín Elsafty, on the Ceól Reoite album and as a 'hidden track' by Cathy Jordan on the Dervish album, Spirit  . The song was also performed by Nuala Ní Chanainn in the 2002 production of Aistir/Voyage by the Swiss- based, Cathy Sharp Dance Ensemble.

"'''[[You Raise Me Up]]'''" - It was in fact reading Graham's novel The Whitest Flower, that led Norwegian composer, [[Rolf Løvland|Rolf Lovland]] to contact Graham with a melody. This melody in turn inspired Graham to write the lyric -You Raise Me Up, which has been recorded by some 400 artists (including [[Westlife]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Brian Kennedy (singer)|Brian Kennedy]] and [[Secret Garden (duo)|Secret Garden]], [[Daniel O'Donnell]], [[Helene Fischer]], [[Il Divo]], [[Russell Watson]] and [[Paul Potts]]) and has become one of the most successful songs in popular music history.

[[Brendan Graham]] has also recently written a number of integrated song and narrative pieces including '''Writing the Famine in Fiction and Song''', for The National Famine Commemoration Week in Ireland, 2010. This was narrated by the author with songs performed by Cathy Jordan accompanied on piano by Feargal Murray.

In Quebec, 2011, his shorter narrative and song piece – '''From Famine to Freedom – Ireland to Grosse Ile''' – was performed by the [[Quebec Symphony Orchestra]] and soloist Méav Ní Mhaolchatha, with Graham's narration translated into French. It included a first performance with orchestra of The Whitest Flower, Graham's title song for the soundtrack to his book. In response to the view handed down at the time of Ireland's Famine that "The judgement of God…sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson, that calamity must not be too much mitigated" (Charles E. Trevelyan – Permanent Assistant Secretary at the British Treasury with prime responsibility for Famine relief in Ireland), Graham's song calls to task a vengeful God:-

In August 2012 Brendan Graham composed and presented '''From Famine to Freedom—Ireland to Australia''', a commemoration in word and song of those who suffered during An Gorta Mór–The Great Irish Famine–and of those who fled the Famine to establish a new life Australia. Graham wrote a new song called, '''"Orphan Girl"''', dedicated to the memory of the 4,112, mainly teenage Irish orphan girls, who were given a free passage to Australia from Workhouses in every county of Ireland between 1848 and 1850. Brendan Graham was joined by Australian singer-songwriter, '''[[Sarah Calderwood]]''' who unites classic with contemporary folk. She is the charismatic front woman of Australia's premier Celtic group, '''Sunas''', who released the ABC best-selling debut album ‘As Night Falls’. Graham and Calderwood were also joined on the day by the inspirational '''Australian Girls Choir''', who have previously performed for Nelson Mandela, Oprah Winfrey, Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama. The commemoration in words and song was a community day of celebration and remembering, especially for those who are descendants of these Irish Workhouse young women.For more information see www.irishfaminememorial.org

More recently in March 2013 '''The Possible Dreams Choir''' toured Victoria in Australia, singing '''"Orphan Girl"''' (sung by Fortunate and Nomcebo) and '''"You Raise Me Up"''' as part of their '''Voices for the Voiceless''' tour. Possible Dreams International, Inc is a non-profit organisation which partners with rural and remote communities in Swaziland, Southern Africa to empower families and individuals living with extreme poverty, malnutrition and endemic disease. So in Graham's "Famine in Song" lyrics, there resonates a global reach.

A famous modern song on the famine is "[[The Fields of Athenry]]", by [[Pete St. John]]. Written in three verses, it deals with a fictitious but realistic story of "Michael" being deported to [[Botany Bay]] for stealing corn to feed his starving family. Performed in folk, traditional and even reggae versions, it is often sung by supporters of [[Glasgow]]'s [[Celtic F.C.]], many of whom are of Irish descent. The song itself sums up the sense of despair, anger and bitterness of famine victims. The song was also covered by [[Boston]] [[punk rock]] band, the [[Dropkick Murphys]] on their 2003 ''[[Blackout (Dropkick Murphys album)|Blackout]]'' album.
[[File:Famine memorial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rowan Gillespie]]'s "Famine", in Ireland Park, [[Toronto]] [[Harbourfront (Toronto)|Harbourfront]]]]

[[Luka Bloom]]'s song 'Forgiveness' from his album Salty Heaven is sung from the point of view of an Irish Famine refugee who has relocated to Canada and who despite his suffering has chosen forgiveness over bitterness.

Luka Bloom's brother [[Christy Moore]] also has a song, written by Bloom but recorded by Moore, called 'The City of Chicago,' that chronicles the effects of the Famine and the subsequent mass emigration.

[[Pagan metal]] band [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]] also have a song about the Famine named "The Coffin Ships" on their 2005 album ''[[The Gathering Wilderness]]''.

Another related song is "Famine" by [[Sinéad O'Connor]], released on the [[Universal Mother]] album. The lyrics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhb.fr/langues/Cei/soconnor.htm UHB.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003814/http://www.uhb.fr/langues/cei/soconnor.htm |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasise the political aspect of the famine.

==Ireland and modern famine relief==

Ireland has been at the forefront of international famine relief.  In 1985 [[Bob Geldof]], Irish rock star and founder of [[Live Aid]], revealed that the people of Ireland had given more to his fundraising efforts per head of population than any other nation in the world. Irish NGOs ''[[Goal (charity)|Goal]]'', ''[[Concern (charity)|Concern]]'', ''[[Trócaire]]'' and ''[[Gorta]]'' play a central role in helping famine victims throughout Africa. In 2000, [[Bono]], lead singer with Irish band [[U2]], played a central role in campaigning for [[debt relief]] for African nations in the [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign. The Irish famine experience continues to influence many Irish people in their attitudes towards the [[developing world]] and famine victims everywhere.

He was a son of Zdzisław (captain of polish artillery, murdered in Katyń in March 1940) and Janina née Wałęga (polish and Ukrainian teacher). He  was a lieutenant in Polish counterintelligence for a few years.

Gondek's special research includes the legal justice system of the [[Polish Underground State]] during World War II,&lt;ref name="internationalresearchcenter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.internationalresearchcenter.org/research_center/media/PatternsOfCooperationCollaborationAndBetrayal.pdf | title=Patterns of Cooperation, Collaboration and Betrayal | date=October 2009 | work=PDF 1.89 MB | accessdate=April 19, 2012 | author=Mark Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google/Gondek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.google.ca/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Leszek+Gondek%22 | title=Inauthor:"Leszek Gondek" | work=[[Google Books]] | accessdate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Polish postwar military missions, the political, economic and military consequences of war for occupied Germany, and the history of air sports and physical training aimed at developing defensive strategies by Poland's army during the communist years.&lt;ref name="polishhistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polishhistory.pl/17.html?&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bcat%5D=23&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=10&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2244&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=12&amp;cHash=ca275e2868521bec03dd3fa675b44aa8 | title=W imieniu Rzeczpospolitej.

Gondek's analysis of the underground Special Military Courts, Civil Courts and the Special Committees of the Polish Secret State is based on documents and legal papers published already during the occupation of Poland. Much attention is paid to legal and structural changes experienced by these organizations in the course of war, as in the case of [[National Armed Forces]] and the [[Tatra Confederation]] ([[:pl:Konfederacja Tatrzańska|Konfederacja Tatrzańska]]) behind the Soviet front. Gondek attempts to present the multitude of challenges facing the underground judiciary across the whole territory of the former [[Polish Second Republic|Second Republic]].&lt;ref name="polishhistory" /&gt;

The following is a list of licences to crenellate, surviving in the records, issued from the 12th to 16th centuries, which was compiled by the amateur historian Philip Davis&lt;ref&gt;Philip Davis stated on his web-site "Gatehouse Gazetteer": [http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/author/author.html] "I am not a professional historian and have no academic qualifications in the field so please take my site as the work of an amateur enthusiast. However, I do try to apply the highest academic standards to my work, including this site, and my research on licenses to crenellate has been published in the Castle Studies Group Journal"&lt;/ref&gt; and published in the ''Castle Studies Group Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Davis |first=Philip |year=2006–2007 |url=http://www.castlestudiesgroup.org.uk/Licences%20to%20Crenellate%20-%20Philip%20Davis.pdf |format=PDF |title=English Licences to Crenellate: 1199-1567' |journal=The Castle Studies Group Journal |volume=20 |pages=226–245}}. The list does not mention at present which ones he felt dubious&lt;/ref&gt; A few supposed licences sometimes quoted in other sources were questioned by Davis as dubious, deemed forgeries or were rejected entirely, but were still included in his list suitably qualified.

'''Nicolay''' (de Nicolaÿ/Nicolaï) - &lt;small&gt;refer to [[Nobility particle]]&lt;/small&gt;) is a European noble family of the [[Ancien Régime]] with its roots in the south of France at the early part of the 14th Century. There is however, evidence to suggest that its origins stretch further back to the growth of the city state of [[Florence]] at the beginning of the [[Florentine Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gilles Bubois Blogspot" Notice Historique et Généalogique sur la Maison de Nicolay&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nicolay family was originally associated with the French noble classes of the [[Nobles of the Robe]] and the [[Nobles of the Sword]].  It is well documented that members of the House of Nicolay became highly influential in the spheres of national government, law, the church, academia, military and diplomatic service, as well as the arts. They held the titles of [[marquis]], [[count]] and [[baron]].

==Origins==
The surname Nicolay (with the spellings Nicolai/Nickolay being regional derivatives){{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, seems to have its root in the Greek name Νικολαος (Nikolaos) which means "victory of the people" from Greek νικη (nike) "victory" and λαος (Laos) "people" {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.  Furthermore, "laos" or "λαὸς" in Greek, originates from the word root "-las", as found in the word "λα-τομεῑο" meaning "stone" or "rock" {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.  The addition of the particules 'de' and 'von' (indicating nobility in France and Germany respectively), would appear to be later additions {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

The earliest known reference to the family de Nicolay begins with Guy (also known as Guglielmo) who was born close to [[Florence, Italy]] and accompanied [[Pope Clement V]] in around 1305, when the Papacy was first established in [[Poitiers]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} His son, Guy (II) (who had married Jaqueline de Baroncelli) followed his father to France and settled in the town of [[Bourg-Saint-Andéol]] in the Province of [[Vivarais]] (now the [[Ardèche]]).  Guy &amp; Jaqueline de Nicolay had a son, who they named Ahoult.  Ahoult grew to be an influential and accomplished man; exerting the role of Lieutenant of the Bailiff of the King in Vivarais.  He married Jeanne de Barjac.  Their son was Guy III who married Antoinette de Casteljau who bore two sons; Jean and Raymond. Jean de Nicolay (named the first in the will of his father) became the author of the branch of the House of Nicolay referred to as the Marquis de [[Goussainville, Val-d'Oise|Goussainville]] and Raymond de Nicolay became the author of the branch of the Baronnie de [[Sabran]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gilles Bubois Blogspot" Notice Historique et Généalogique sur la Maison de Nicolay&lt;/ref&gt;

==The House of Nicolay in France==

The growth of the House of Nicolay over the centuries meant that many members rose to positions of national responsibility, including Chancellor to the [[Kingdom of Naples]] (1502), Count Antoine de Nicolaï who became [[Marshal of France]] in 1775, a General Lieutenant of the [[Grand Master of Artillery]] (under the reign of [[King Louis XIII]]) several Generals, several Colonels of the Regiment of Nicolay Dragoons, four Bishops, a Vice-Legate of [[Avignon]], [[Cahors]], [[Béziers]] and [[Verdun]]; this last at the same time as a member of the family was made First Chaplain to [[Duchess Marie-Josèphe of Saxony]], mother of [[King Louis XVI]].  In addition, the family produced several [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] and Saint-Louis, the First President of the Grand Council, a Member of [[The French Academy]], a Chancellor of the Orders of the King (1789) and the first nine Presidents of the Chamber of Accounts, which from 1506 until 1794, followed one another without interruption.&lt;ref&gt;"from the Records of the French Magistrature, Paris"&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Letters Patent]] of 1645, [[Anne of Austria]], wanting to reward the services rendered by several generations of the House of Nicolay, set the grounds of [[Goussainville, Val-d'Oise|Goussainville]] in Marquisat in favour of Antoine de Nicolay and his descendants.  Towards the end of the fifteenth century, the House of Nicolay was divided into two branches, the first known as the Barons De Sabran, established in [[Ardèche]] and the other, The Marquis de Goussainville, in the [[Île-de-France]].  On 19 May 1815 [[King Louis XVIII]] called the House of Nicolay to hereditary peerage in the name of [[Aymard-Charles-Marie-Theodore Marquis De Nicolay]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gilles Bubois Blogspot" Notice Historique et Généalogique sur la Maison de Nicolay&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable members of the family included [[Nicolas de Nicolay]], [[Aimar-Charles-Marie de Nicolaï]], [[Count]] [[François de Nicolay]].  [[Nicolas de Nicolay]] served for a time as Geographer-in-Ordinary to [[Henry II of France]] and spent most of his adult life traveling throughout Europe and the Turkish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;"Selected Pre-1700 Imprints in the Navy Department Library Monographic Annotations"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1568, Nicolay published an account of his travels under the title, 'Quatre Premiers Livres des Navigations.  The work appeared in several editions including an Italian translation by Francesco Flori published in 1577.

== Background ==

Born Paula Therese O'Neill in [[Liverpool]], UK in 1941, she holds undergraduate degrees in history and education from the [[University of Leeds]], and an M.A. in education from the [[University of Toronto]].

Bourne spent two years as a schoolteacher and lecturer in the UK before taking a one-year teaching position in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1965.  She then spent a year as a research assistant at Chicago's Center for Urban Studies before beginning her long association with the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] (OISE) in 1967.

Bourne began  there as a research officer at OISE. In 1984 she became a research sssociate, also acting as coordinator of OISE's Centre for Women’s Studies in Education from 1989 to 1999. During that time, OISE became part of the University of Toronto. From 1999 to 2007, she taught as a senior lecturer in OISE's Teacher Education program and its graduate program. She was appointed head of the Centre for Women’s Studies in Education  at OISE in 1999, a position which she held until 2006.  In 2002 she became a senior research associate. While at OISE Bourne was known for her course, Gender Equity in Schools and Classrooms, She  also taught School and Society, a sociological overview of education.

Bourne has lectured and provided educational training on the history of Canadian women and gender equity in education both in Canada and internationally, including  Pakistan ([[Aga Khan University]]); Japan ([[Ibaraki University]], [[Kanagawa University]]); and Costa Rica ([[University of Costa Rica]], San Juan).

== Ontario government curriculum resources ==

At the request of the Government of Ontario's [[Ontario Women's Directorate]], Bourne developed curriculum resources to help teachers deal with violence in schools; developed materials to combat date and acquaintance rape on college and university campuses; and led an expert education panel which produced two handbooks and a DVD to help elementary teachers identify children in their classrooms who are or may be witnessing woman abuse at home. Teacher training based on the materials produced by this panel, entitled " Woman Abuse Affects our Children: Resources for Elementary Teachers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.curriculum.org/womanabuse/]&lt;/ref&gt;" continues to take place across Ontario including in many Aboriginal communities and under the auspices of the [[Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario|Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario]] (ETFO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario|url=http://www.etfo.ca/advocacyandaction/womanabuseaffectschildren/pages/default.aspx|accessdate=22 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122135541/http://www.etfo.ca/advocacyandaction/womanabuseaffectschildren/pages/default.aspx|archivedate=22 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ontario Native Education Counselling Association (ONECA).

A '''platinum jubilee''' is a celebration held to mark an [[anniversary]]. Among [[Monarchy|monarchies]], it usually refers to a 70th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand was the most recent monarch to celebrate a platinum jubilee; he died shortly after official celebrations in Thailand took place. The next currently reigning monarch who would celebrate a platinum jubilee is [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] (''technically'' only as Queen of the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]], as all of the other countries she is at present queen of had yet to gain independence at the time of her accession), should she still be reigning on 6 February 2022.

In [[South Asia]]n usage, a "platinum jubilee" refers not to an anniversary, but the celebration of 75 ''weeks''. For instance, in [[Pakistan]] and [[India]], a platinum jubilee film is one shown in cinemas for 75 weeks or more. The success measure for a 'super hit film' is minimum six months release on its main cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |title=Pakistan's Platinum Jubilee Films |publisher=Pakistan Film Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The next level of celebration, an anniversary of 100 years, is simply called a centenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Learning is Fun:Times Tables|author=Ramma Kapoor|publisher=Allied Publishers|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polyaenus''' or '''Polyenus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|l|i|ˈ|iː|n|ə|s}} {{respell|POL|ee|EE|nəs}}; see [[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|ae (æ) vs. e]]; {{lang-grc-gre|Πoλύαινoς|Polyainos}}, "much-praised") was a 2nd-century [[Macedon]]ian author, known best for his ''Stratagems in War'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Στρατηγήματα|Strategemata}}), which has been preserved.  The ''[[Suda]]''{{r|suda}} calls him a [[rhetoric]]ian, and Polyaenus himself writes that he was accustomed to plead causes before the [[Roman emperor]].{{r|pol_2p_8p}} Polyaenus dedicated ''Stratagems in War'' to the two emperors [[Marcus Aurelius]] ({{reign|161|180}}) and [[Lucius Verus]] ({{reign|161|169}}), while they were engaged in the [[Roman–Parthian War of 161–166]], about 163, at which time he was too old to accompany them in their campaigns.{{r|pol_1p}}

==Stratagems==
This work is divided into eight books: the first six contain accounts of the [[stratagem (deception)|stratagems]] of the most celebrated Greek generals, the seventh book contains stratagems of non Greeks and Romans, and the eighth book those of the Romans and of illustrious women. Parts, however, of the sixth and seventh books are lost, so that of the 900 stratagems which Polyaenus described, 833 have survived.

The book has survived in a single copy made in the 13th century, although there exist five abridged versions, which will be discussed below. The full copy once belonged to [[Michel Apostolios]] and is now in the [[Laurentian Library]] in [[Florence]]. The work is written in a clear and pleasing style{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}, though somewhat tinged with the artificial rhetoric of the age{{clarify|date=May 2016}}. It contains a vast number of anecdotes respecting many of the most celebrated men in antiquity, and has uniquely preserved many historical facts.

There are no less than five [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] abridgments of this work, the most important one of which is held in the same library of the original, the Laurentian. This compendium, titled Ὑπoθέσεις ἐκ τῶν στρατηγικῶν πράξεων, contains 58 chapters and 354 stratagems, and is useful to elucidate and explain many passages of the original, lost or not. Despite the existence of the abridgements, Polyaenus' treatise was not popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The original is rarely cited by Byzantine sources, which suggests that it had ceased to circulate, and that the abridgements had replaced it. To this it must be added that only the Ὑπoθέσεις derives directly from the original, while the other four versions seem to be summaries of the first.

Polyaenus was first printed in a [[Latin]] translation, executed by [[Justus Vulteius]], at [[Basel]], 1549. The first edition of the Greek text was published by [[Isaac Casaubon]], [[Lyon]], 1589; the next by [[Pancratius Maasvicius]], [[Leyden]], 1690; the third by [[Samuel Mursinna]], [[Berlin]], 1756; the fourth by Coray, Paris, 1809. The work has been translated into English by R. Shepherd, [[London]], 1793; into German by Seybold, [[Frankfurt]], 1793–94, and by Blume, [[Stuttgart]], 1834.

==Other works==
Polyaenus also wrote several other works, all of which have perished. The ''Suda'' has preserved the titles of two, ''On Thebes'' (Περὶ Θηβῶν) and ''Tactics'', in three books (Τακτικά).  [[Stobaeus]] makes a quotation from a work of Polyaenus, Ὑπὲρ τoῦ κoινoῦ τῶν Mακεδόνων{{r|stob_43.53}} (For the [[koinon of Macedonians]]), and from another entitled Ὑπὲρ τoῦ Συνεδρίoυ{{r|stob_43.41}} (For the [[Synedrion]]). Polyaenus likewise mentions his intention of writing a work on the memorable actions of M. Aurelius and L. Verus.{{r|pol_6p}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3746">'''Regius Professorship of History''' is one of the senior [[List of Professorships at the University of Cambridge|chairs]] in [[history]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. It was founded in 1724 by [[George I of England|George I]] as the '''Regius Professorship of Modern History'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Harris, Samuel|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment is by Royal Warrant on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of the day. Traditionally the Patronage Secretary at Number 10 Downing Street 'took soundings' in Cambridge and put two names before the Prime Minister, of which one was forwarded to the monarch. In 2008, however, Prime Minister Gordon Brown devolved the appointment of all the Regius Professorships onto appointments committees at their respective universities; the Vice-Chancellor is now required to forward the name of the successful candidate, who must have accepted the offer of the post, to the Cabinet Office, which then initiates the recommendation by the Prime Minister and the issuing of the Royal Warrant. The Regius Professorship was originally intended by George I to teach contemporary European history, and four modern language instructors had to be paid for out of the Professor's salary. In 1861 this requirement was dropped. A number of the holders of the Professorship have in fact been medieval history specialists, following a later division of History into Ancient and Modern. In 2010, the Queen and the Privy Council approved the removal of the word 'modern' from the title to reflect this change in usage, on the recommendation of the History Faculty and the University.

The '''Southern Maya Area''' (SMA) is a part of [[Mesoamerica]], long believed important to the rise of [[Maya civilization]], the period that is also known as [[Preclassic Maya]]. It lies within a broad arc or cantilevered rectangle from [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]], in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, in the northwest due south to [[Izapa]] and [[Paso de la Amada]], from Chiapa de Corzo southeast to [[Copán]], Honduras, and from Copán south to [[Chalchuapa]], El Salvador.

The Pacific Ocean forms the southern and western limits of the Southern Maya Area. Within this area and in addition to these sites are found the major centers of [[Kaminaljuyu]], [[Takalik Abaj]], [[Chocolá]], El Sitio, El Jobo, [[La Blanca]], [[Ujuxte]], Palo Gordo, [[El Baúl]], [[Cotzumalhuapa]], [[Monte Alto culture|Monte Alto]], Semetabaj, El Portón, Zacualpa, [[Zaculeu]], [[Balberta]], and La Montana; many of these sites are believed to have been built and populated by speakers of Maya languages, and others by speakers of other Mesoamerican languages, including [[Xinca language|Xinca]], [[Lenca language|Lenca]], [[Mixe–Zoquean]], and [[Pipil language|Pipil]]; accordingly, in consideration of the multilingual character of the Southern Maya Area, in many ways Southern "Maya" Area is a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;Love and Kaplan (2011) point out that scholarship has been deficient in studying the Southern Maya Area as a cultural area unto itself, that is, without reference to other entities and areas.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these centers developed to their apogees in the Preclassic period before declining or disappearing. In addition to these large sites, many Early Preclassic communities, found mostly along the Pacific Coast, bear witness to the seminal character of the Southern area; notably these include La Victoria, a site studied by [[Michael Coe]] that yielded the first secure ceramic sequence from early on in Preclassic times. Since Coe’s work, [[John E. Clark]] and other scholars from the [[New World Archaeological Foundation]] have found, at Paso de la Amada and other sites, ceramics that refine and deepen in time Coe’s sequence, pushing back to [[circa|ca.]] 2000 BC the earliest nuclear centers, fine pottery, figurines, and other manifestations of the beginnings of complex society and culture in Mesoamerica. The earliest pristine [[ballcourt]] and evidence of a [[ranked society]] (a rich child's burial), indicative of emerging social hierarchization, were found at Paso de la Amada and nearby. At La Blanca, archaeologists discovered a quatrefoil made of baked clay buried near Mound 1, one of the largest and earliest temple mounds in Mesoamerica, indicating an early fount of what later became core Maya ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Love and Guernsey interpret this as an icon for a "portal: Love, Michael; with Julia Guernsey (2005).

(FAMSI). Retrieved on 2007-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminological and Theoretical issues==
Controversy remains about the origins of Maya civilization as scholars continue to search for and engage in debate about the roots or first impulses of what became an ancient civilization traditionally considered to have been one of the greatest of the world. Combined with the early frame of cultural development relative to elsewhere in Mesoamerica and given that the Southern area remains distinctly mysterious with respect to how and why complex societies developed as dramatically as they did, the Southern Maya Area is almost as much a theoretical construct as it is a geographical and temporal reality. This is because topics such as cultural evolution, complex societies, early urbanism, and the construction of (ancient) identity, all framed and discussed in highly abstract ways, necessarily are raised.

If the Southern Maya Area is a part of Mesoamerica delineated from the rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense – by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one needs to understand that posing this large research question risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how “origins” might be considered or defined – essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is “Maya civilization”? What is “Maya”? What is “civilization”? What allows us to call this or that civilization “great”? One way to conceptualize the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that such an effort leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is whatever it is primordially that made “Maya” “Maya.” Another way is to focus on ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription,&lt;ref&gt;See Carneiro (1970) A Theory of the Origin of the State. Science 169:733-738&lt;/ref&gt; peer polity interaction,&lt;ref&gt;See Renfrew, Colin and John F. Cherry (1986) Peer Polity Interaction and Socio-political Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; and other theories.

Despite these seemingly terminologically pitfall-laden inquiries, the question of Maya origins is justified for professional focus and elaboration, since all historical topics are, by their nature, constituted not only by ascriptions weighting the given topic in importance and cast by this or that interpretation or interpretative context but also by “fact.” Of necessity, these kinds of questions are rooted in the history of scholarship about this or that topic, taking into account different or new emphases or de-emphases, usually generationally or paradigmatically determined. Accordingly, “Maya civilization” is both a reality  - as [[John Lloyd Stephens]] first discovered - and a scholarly construct, with strands in the weave composed of actual patterns and “emergent” entities and characteristics but also of patterns and agentive decisions historically in the scholarly world, these, themselves, retroactively considered and reconsidered.

==The Thermometer theory==
Maya scholarship long has considered the ancient Maya in a temporal and geographic sense to have come into being, thermometer-fashion – as things began to “warm up,” socially and culturally – at the “bottom,” that is, in Southern Mesoamerica, in the Early Preclassic period: events and processes coalesced on the Pacific coast of what is now Guatemala and southern Mexico and in the piedmont and highlands of Guatemala and in northern El Salvador, moved north in Classic period times to the Maya Lowlands of northern Guatemala and southern Chiapas, Mexico; and migrated still further north into Yucatán following the Maya “collapse” in the 10th century AD. Mayanists from the New World Archaeological Foundation as well as other institutions have pioneered the efforts to discover the radix of Maya civilization from work at such sites as [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]] and [[Izapa]] building on efforts by [[Michael Coe]] at La Victoria, on the southern Pacific coast of Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Coe, M. D. (1961) La Victoria, An Early Site on the Pacific Coast of Guatemala. Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology LIII. Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; and followed up by the work of scholars such as [[John E. Clark]], Barbara Voorhies, Barbara Stark, Robert Sharer and others. Notable, as well, is the work of Franz Termer at Palo Gordo. Work by Carnegie archaeologists A. V. Kidder and [[Edwin M. Shook]]&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, Alfred V., Jesse D. Jennings, and Edwin M. Shook (1946) Excavations at Kaminaljuyú, Guatemala. Carnegie Institution of Washington Publication 561, Washington, D.C.; Shook, Edwin M. and Alfred V. Kidder (1952) Mound E-III-3, Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala. In Contributions to American Anthropology and History, Vol. 9 (53):33-127. Carnegie Institution of Washington Publication 596. Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; at Kaminaljuyu has been fundamental in moving attention to the origins of Maya civilization to the South. Since their work, many other sites have been identified and at which investigations have either been carried out or are contemplated in determining the role of the Southern area in the trajectory of Maya civilization.[[File:Formative Period southern Mesoamerica 2.svg|325px|left|thumb|Southernmost sites of the Southern Maya area.]]

==Two “emergents,” linguistics and the Olmec==
The notion of an aboriginal Maya stimulus – linguistic, cultural, and ethnic strands interweaving together from late in the Paleoindian or Archaic periods – derives primarily from reconstructions of Maya linguistics. Ironically, a non-Maya stimulus also is considered, the [[Olmec]]; as at Takalik Abaj, direct Olmec influence seems to have come to [[Chocolá]], as the remarkable monument known as the "Shook Panel" was found some ten kilometers south of the site.

Beyond these two “emergent” factors, processual archaeology continues to look at functionalist and highly theoretized aspects of social and cultural process, including egalitarian-to-hierarchical communities and other cultural evolutionary sequences, for example, those of Service and Fried, and of environment, “man-land interactions,” and zero-sum finite resource responses (e.g., “carrying capacity”).

Rough and sometimes illogically and erroneously inspired characterizations of social and cultural development derived from evolutionary biology threaten to muddy the discussion just as traditional yet persistent cultural historical characterizations leave many questions unanswered, given their emphasis on description as opposed to explanation.

By this token a theoretical dichotomy exists between advocates of autochthonous developments, that is, developments occurring from internal - often functionalist - processes, and those proposing that more fundamental in the creation of History have been native genius, diffusion, migrations, and so forth.

Historical linguists long have posed that a proto-Maya language had as its homeland the western highlands of southern Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;McQuown, N. A. 1956 The Classification of the Mayan Languages; International Journal of American Linguistics 22:191-195; Swadesh, Mauricio (1961) Interrelaciones de las lenguas Mayenses Anales del Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia 13(42):231-267. Mexico; see also Justeson, John S., William M. Norman, Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman 1985 The Foreign Impact on Lowland Mayan Language and Script. Middle American Research Institute Publication 53, Tulane University, New Orleans&lt;/ref&gt; While the issue remains somewhat controversial, no viable competing theory yet has been offered, although qualifications to the original view of Maya linguistic origin continue to be provided.

Accordingly, since a language or language family may be considered a cultural universal, linguistics seemingly points to the Southern area as the aboriginal home of the Maya.

Another theorized stimulus, forerunner, or “mother” to the Maya, at least with regard to certain hallmark traits of Maya civilization – writing and the Maya calendar – is the [[Olmec]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Coe, Michael D. and Richard A. Diehl (1980) In the Land of the Olmec; Vol. 1: Archaeology of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán; Vol. 2: The People of the River. University of Texas Press, Austin; (1996) The Olmec World: Ritual and Rulership; with essays by Michael D. Coe, Richard A. Diehl, David A. Freidel, Peter T. Furst, F. Kent Reilly, III, Linda Schele, Carolyn Tate, and Karl A. Taube. The Art Museum, Princeton University/Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Princeton and New York; Sharer, Robert J. and David W. Grove, eds. (1989) Regional Perspectives on the Olmec. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeology does tend to support a movement through time and space, west from the Olmec heartland in Tabasco and Veracruz, Mexico; across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, down the Pacific coast of Mexico and Guatemala, and east from the coast through the piedmont - where Chocolá and Takalik Abaj are found - and highlands beyond Kaminaljuyu. However, such a scenario depends on how much or little one attributes a formal unity to Olmec civilization.

==Competing theories==
Discussions of the Southern Maya area as important if not essential to the rise of Classic Maya civilization and must be related to discussions of the putative primacy of developments in the Northern Petén, and vice versa. Fundamentally, the debate is between those who put more weight on the temporal priority of complex cultural and social achievements in the South and those who favor northern Guatemala for these developments. Large Preclassic cities with structures boasting the most massive scale in the ancient Maya world include [[El Mirador]], [[Nakbe]], Tintal, Wakna, and others from the [[Mirador Basin]], north of the greatest Maya city in Classic times, [[Tikal]]. Without doubt, these cities represent an extraordinary development in Maya civilization; however, their dating remains essentially Late Preclassic, and scant evidence is found of two of the hallmark traits of Classic Maya civilization: upright carved shaft stones called [[stelae]], which marked the birth of the cult of kingship, and [[Maya script|hieroglyphic writing]]. While stelae and hieroglyphic writing from the Preclassic abound in the Southern area, proponents of the Lowlands, i.e., the Mirador Basin, as the origin locus for Maya civilization assert that the first Maya societies to reach the level of the state, accordingly, base their claim fundamentally on size and scale of construction, as well as on myriad evidence of distinct connections between these northern cities including even the ''[[sacbe]]ob'', the “white ways” or “high roads” that networked among them.

Some of the debates between Southern Maya area scholars and what might be called the “autochthonous school” of Maya scholarship – those advocating a unique or primary role to antecedents to Classic Maya civilization in the Northern Petén – are based as well on highly theoritized accounts of expansion of Maya peoples as interpreted by changing ceramic spheres. While some evidence supports the “Chicanel Expansion,”&lt;ref&gt;[[John E. Clark|Clark, J. E.]], R. D. Hansen and T. Pérez Suárez (2000) La zona maya en el Preclásico. In El México Antiguo, sus áreas culturales, los orígenes y el horizonate Preclásico; L. Manzanilla and L. López Luján, eds; 436-510. Historia Antigua de México, Vol. 1. INAH, México, D.F.&lt;/ref&gt; one does not find Chicanel pottery in the southern Highlands nor, indeed, in any significant quantity anywhere in the Southern area in the Preclassic

While evidence such as size and scale of site and of individual structures (e.g., El Tigre at El Mirador) is compelling, developments in the Southern area remain resilient against conclusive consensus. The temporal priority of plentiful as opposed to scant evidence of stelae and writing in the Preclassic south compared to the Mirador Basin must be based principally on absolute dating, although this problem, itself, becomes difficult to resolve when events are dated by &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C (“calibrated” or “uncalibrated”) – still the most widely used absolute dating method in Mesoamerica – and which cannot be rendered more fine-grained than ca. 100 years and often is less precise. Accordingly, the debate about temporal priority will remain unresolved unless and until other absolute dating methods such as archaeomagnetics and luminescence (hitherto, thermoluminescence), are applied more widely, or [[Long Count]]-dated texts, e.g., Cycle 6, are found earlier than those found thus far, which are Cycle 7. While relative dating methods – principally ceramic – are highly reliable, having been cross-referenced from many sites, and with sophisticated statistics available, unless anchored to absolute dates, these remain uncertain especially when the scholar’s focus is on the early periods of development in Mesoamerica.

=="High Traits" of the Southern Maya==
“High traits” of ancient Maya civilization prominently include hieroglyphic writing and the Maya Long Count calendar, with the former constituting one of a handful, worldwide, of pristine inventions of writing and the latter comprising the invention of the concept of zero and other mathematical achievements unequalled at the time in Europe as well as extraordinary achievements in astronomy. Beginning in the Late Preclassic period and proliferating exponentially during the Classic Maya period, Maya texts are dateable because correlation can be made between Maya Long Count dates and the Gregorian calendar. Accordingly, with great certainty we can speak of the Classic period as framed by the large-scale appearance throughout the Maya world by the third to fourth century AD of dated texts on carved monuments, and by the disappearance of these texts on monuments by the 10th century AD. (Consensual acceptance of one correlation between the Maya Long Count and the Gregorian calendar – known as the Goodman-Martinez-Thompson or "G.M.T.” correlation – has come only fairly recently. In this correlation, a beginning date of August 12, 3114 BC, gives the Maya calendar its arrow-of-time character, just as the 0 date for the Christian calendar divides Western time-keeping into an absolute divide by virtue of which an infinite counting of both past and future time is permitted as opposed to “cyclical time.”)&lt;ref&gt;This is not to say that Maya time-keeping did not rely on a belief that cosmic cycles, or "ages," came and went. The end of the 13th ''baktun'' or period of 400 years comprising 360 days each comes in December, 2012, when a new cosmic age will begin.&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned, one of the arguments in favor of the Southern area as “more seminal” to those of the Petén is based on the presently inarguable fact that by far the greatest number of Preclassic hieroglyphic texts are found in the South; for example, numerous texts were carved on monuments from Kaminaljuyu, the greatest city in the Southern area and one of the great ancient cities in world cultural patrimony. Several of  the earliest calendrical texts, as well, are found in the South at, for example, Takalik Abaj and [[El Baúl]], although the very earliest – by ca. 60 years – confirmed thus far are found at Chiapa de Corzo and [[Tres Zapotes]], that is, from sites with an Olmec (or “[[Epi-Olmec culture|epi-Olmec]]”) identity. Glyphs found at [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], in the Petén, may date to as early as 300 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Saturno, William A., David Stuart, Boris Beltrán (2006) Early Maya Writing at San Bartolo, Guatemala. Science 311 (5765):1281-1283&lt;/ref&gt; but these texts are very short in length and do not bear Long Count or Calendar Round dates. Calendrical origins, themselves, from the most compelling evidence, must be attributed to a thin latitudinal band stretching across southern Guatemala, and including sites such as Chocolá and Takalik Abaj.

In addition to hieroglyphics and calendrical innovations, the Southern area is noted for sites that, early on in the trajectory of Mesoamerica civilization, can be characterized as fully urban, and also for the appearance of long-distance trade in such vital commodities as obsidian and cacao, for the first true cults of sacred rulership or kingship, for masterfully carved monumental art, and for a very complex ideology and religion, probably based on some primordial version of the [[Popol Vuh]].

We are left with the developments in the South still attributable fundamentally to their own autochthonous emergence, excepting, as mentioned, the evidence of some kind of Olmec influence spreading east to west across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, south along the Pacific coast, and west to east through the Guatemalan piedmont to the highlands, at Kaminaljuyu, and then east still farther. This putative march of Olmec missionaries, warriors, and/or traders – a scenario really feasible only if one accepts the ''Cultura Madre'' concept of Olmec civilization as opposed to the ''primus inter pares'' argument and if one interprets artifacts as “Olmec” and not simply “Olmecoid” – conceivably would have been catalyzed by the threefold attractions of cacao, in Soconusco, Mexico; the Guatemalan piedmont, centrally in which lie Chocolá and Escuintla, Guatemala; obsidian, from enormous beds in the highlands, with Kaminaljuyu as the main beneficiary of trade in this “steel of the New World;" and blue jade, hallmark of Olmec lore and treasure, from a great outcrop above the Motagua River east of Kaminaljuyu. That the Southern area originally constituted a truly astonishing source of material wealth, indeed a breadbasket, may have underlain the primordial appearance of cultural achievements such as writing, the calendar, kingship, masterful art, and complex religion, receives further support continuing through time in the Early Classic and evidence of interaction with [[Teotihuacan]], the single greatest ancient city of Mesoamerica and the religious if not imperial capital for much of central Mexico, with hegemony extending far and wide. Such a profound material basis for the unique importance of the Southern area to civilizational developments is evidenced, as well, throughout the Classic period, with the appearance of the Cotzumalguapan culture – its sites ca. 60 kilometers east of Chocolá – and its emphasis on cacao and warfare, indicative of competition over this most highly prized commodity in Mesoamerica, and throughout the Postclassic, as ethnohistory records the enormous amounts of products, including cacao, exported from the South, a pattern that continued after the Conquest, with Spanish ''encomiendas'' still exploiting this vital resource and other agricultural products, and which constituted the beginning of the transformation of much of Guatemala into a vast farm growing cash-crops for export.

Returning to the fact that "Southern Maya Area" risks being a misnomer, that the Southern Maya Area comprised a volatile mix of peoples, languages, and cultures with correspondingly dynamic interactions provides more support for the argument that the South took part in seminal developments and a vault upward socially and culturally to Classic Maya civilization, in a manner at least co-equal to the northern Petén.

==The Early and Middle Classic: Chocolate Wars==
It may be argued in favor of a greater unity in the Southern Maya Area than the ethnic and linguistic diversity might otherwise indicate simply by virtue of the fact that a “Preclassic collapse” occurred extending through much of the Southern Maya Area .&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern Maya Area, in times called Classic for the Maya in the Lowlands to the north, tantalizing evidence exists of an abhorrence of a vacuum in the materially very rich breadbasket of the Area – and, as mentioned, particularly of a continuation of what must have been an extraordinary intensively cultivated commodity of enormous importance in Mesoamerica, and the Maya, in cuisine, ideologically, and even as currency, cacao. In the Guatemalan piedmont, located not more than sixty kilometers east of Chocola, Cotzumalguapa, of Middle Classic trajectory, is renowned for carved stone sculpture intimately associating decapitation and other sacrifice with cacao, associations we must conclude are representative of fierce warfare over this commodity, and copious ethnohistory from early after the Spanish Conquest makes reference to “chiefs” and chiefdoms fighting over production and distribution of the chocolate bean and/or its processed forms.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tama-Re''' village in [[Putnam County, Georgia]] (a.k.a. "Kodesh", "Wahannee", "The Golden City", "Al Tamaha") was an [[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian-themed]] set of buildings and monuments established in 1993 on 476 acres near [[Eatonton, Georgia|Eatonton]] by the [[Nuwaubian Nation]]. This was a religious movement that had a variety of esoteric beliefs and was led by [[Dwight D. York]]. Many of the African Americans in the community had resettled here from [[Brooklyn, New York]], where the movement had developed since about 1970.

York was prosecuted for child molestation, racketeering and financial charges; convicted in 2004, he was sentenced to 135 years in prison. As part of the verdict, the Tama-Re complex was sold under government forfeiture in 2005. The structures were mostly demolished, and the site cleared by the sheriff's department to prepare it for sale.

==History==
On January 15, 1993, [[Dwight York]], longtime leader of a Muslim-related religious community in Brooklyn, New York, bought the property of 476 acres on 404 Shady Dale Road for $975,000. His followers began moving in from their former headquarters in [[Sullivan County, New York]] (some had moved there in the late 1980s) and Brooklyn.

After the move, York declared affiliation with the Yamasee indigenous people, as well as a variety of Egyptian and esoteric themes, claiming that the community was descended from ancient migrants to the Americas from Egypt. York said {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}{{Year needed|date=September 2011}}
:"We moved to [[Eatonton, Georgia]] because we are the [[Nuwaubianism#Yamassee|Yamassee]], a branch of the [[Washitaw Nation|Washitaw Moors]], The [[Mound builder (people)|Mound Builders]]. Our Ancestors built the [[Rock Eagle Effigy Mound|Rock Eagle Mound]] and many others in such states as [[Wisconsin]], [[Ohio]], [[South Carolina]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Tennessee]]. This is why we chose Eatonton to live. It is close to Rock Eagle Mound."

In 1997 and 1998, Victor Greig acted as York's representative in building and zoning matters as the community developed Tama-Re. He was cited by Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills for building without a permit and for illegally operating a nightclub in a warehouse, which was not zoned for that use. Greig was fined $45,750 in April 1998 and appealed. His fine was reduced to $2,500, but the conviction was upheld.

The organization began to hold festivals on the property, with one netting about $500,000 in cash, according to an FBI agent's testimony.&lt;ref name="atlmag"&gt;{{cite|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQ4AAAAAMBAJ&amp;ots=ASkbynOWKm&amp;pg=PA126|work=Atlanta Magazine|date=June 2007|title=Pyramid Scheme|author=Bill Osinski|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a lawsuit was filed attempting to enforce county zoning restrictions and prevent the Nuwaubians from using the property for anything other than residential and agricultural purposes. This led to a drawn-out, bitter tug of war between the Nuwaubians and the county authorities. At the annual week-long celebration "Savior's Day" (i.e. York's birthday) in June 1999, the county padlocked the nightclub warehouse.

In 2000, a security/paramilitary group called the Royal Guard Of Amen-Ra, Inc., owned by actor [[Wesley Snipes]]'s ''Amen Ra Films'', filed [[BATF]] papers to set up a security training center next to the Tama-Re compound.&lt;ref name="Heimlich" /&gt; The Nuwaubians claimed Snipes as one of their own, though a spokeswoman for Snipes denied any connection.

''New York Press'' in November 2000 described the constructions completed in the compound:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not long after you're pretty sure you've gone too far, roll up and over one last hill and the pyramids are right there. There's a black one and a gold one, and a brown-faced sphinx facing the road, and a tall obelisk, and an arch-shaped gate decorated with ankhs and other hieroglyphs, through which runs a road lined with statues of mostly animal-headed deities, all brightly painted in primary colors. Farther back, up on the rise, is a recognizable one, [[Isis]], with ebony skin and her winged arms spread. No level of expectation can dilute the surprise–you can't believe what you're seeing. Tama-Re, Egypt of the West, has that [[Magic Kingdom]] quality.&lt;ref name="Heimlich"&gt;Heimlich, Adam. "A Visit to Tama-Re", ''New York Press'', 8 November 2000{{cite web |url=http://www.nypress.com/print.cfm?content_id=3036 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109152729/http://www.nypress.com/print.cfm?content_id=3036 |archivedate=9 November 2005 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2001, the ''Religious Movements Homepage Project'' at the [[University of Virginia]] reported on Tama-Re:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Armed guards stand at the entrance to Tama-Re. Approximately 100 Nuwaubians live within 15 [[Mobile home|double-wide trailers]] within this complex. There are approximately another 400 more Nuwaubians within [[Putnam County, Georgia|Putnam County]] (population 14,000). At this current complex the Nuwaubians have constructed an Egyptian-style village with two pyramids, obelisks, and statues of Egyptian leaders. The two pyramids are distinct in appearance and in usage. There is a gold pyramid that serves as a trade center. Within this pyramid one can find a bookstore and a clothing store. The other pyramid is painted black with colorful Egyptian symbols painted on the outside. This structure serves as a church. Within the church, loudspeakers play Egyptian chants 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuwaubian Nation of Moors", ''The Religious Movements Homepage Project @ The University of Virginia'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20010124082500/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/nuwaubians.html web archive], citing: Osinski, Bill. "Racial, legal issues cloud Egypt," ''The Atlanta Journal and Constitution'', September 20, 1998: 01C. Mays, Patricia. "Georgia Cult's Pyramids, Space Prophecy Alarms Neighbors," ''Chattanooga Times'', August 1, 1999: A5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2002, the Nuwaubians finally submitted a permit application for the nightclub, now called a "fellowship hall", allowing them to use the building for the first time since it was padlocked. On 8 May 2002, the compound was raided by the FBI, ATF, and related forces from local, state, and federal departments. No shots were fired during the raid, although tear gas was used by FBI agents. Based on a lengthy investigation, authorities arrested York on charges of racketeering and child molestation, including transporting children across state lines for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

After York was convicted and sentenced for these charges, in June 2005, the property was sold under [[government forfeiture]] by the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] for USD 1.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Torpy, Bill. "Demolition begins on land seized from Nuwaubian sect," ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' Atlanta, Ga.: 11 June 2005. pg. E2&lt;/ref&gt; About half of this money went to the Putnam County Sheriff's Department, while most of the rest was split between the [[FBI]] and [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;Torpy, Bill "Nuwaubian sect shows support for jailed leader," ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' Atlanta, Ga.: 15 Sep. 2005. pg. D1&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 2005 workers began demolishing the Egyptian-styled façades. Putnam County Sheriff [[Howard Sills]] started the demolition by tearing down the front arch with a [[front-end loader]]. The land has since been entirely cleared of all Nuwaubian structures and the property was sold to a developer, who has since built a [[log cabin|log style]] [[hunting lodge]] on the property.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8fFWJ5hplw White Oak Plantation]&lt;/ref&gt; The property is owned by White Oak Plantation as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://qpublic.schneidercorp.com/Application.aspx?AppID=761&amp;LayerID=11797&amp;PageTypeID=4&amp;PageID=5583&amp;KeyValue=020%20002 Putnam County Assessor's Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Terentius et delusor'''''&lt;ref&gt;Translated "Terence and the Heckler" by Erich Segal and "Altercation between Terence and his Critic" by Peter Dronke.&lt;/ref&gt; is an anonymous poetical treatise, variously described as a [[dialogue]]&lt;ref name=segal&gt;Segal, 221.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Drama|spoken play]],&lt;ref name=dronkexvii&gt;Dronke, ''Nine Medieval Latin Plays'', xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; preserved only in fragments in a twelfth-century manuscript. It is the earliest example of the author or presenter of a play appearing as a person in the work, and in this case both appear: [[Terence]] and the (critical) theatrical producer (''persona delusoris''). The poem was probably acted or recited before a performance of one of Terence's works.&lt;ref&gt;Ogilvy, 619.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dronke, ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'', 58, notes that there are directions for movement (''nunc Terentius exit foras audiens haec et ait'', "now Terence comes out, hearing this, and says"), for asides to the audience, and for impersonation, all implying performance. This would have been less like a "staged" play and more like a ''scenica lectio'' (acted reading), which was known in the twelfth century as a method of "doing" Terence.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been dated to the fifth century,&lt;ref name=segal/&gt; the seventh,&lt;ref&gt;Magnin, according to Menéndez y Pelayo, chapt. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; between the seventh and eleventh,&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; the ninth or tenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Manso, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] (ninth century).&lt;ref name=dronkexvii/&gt; The piece often finds mention beside [[Roswitha]], who composed Christian dramas in Terentian style.

The plot of the brief performance piece is that the producer criticises Terence's plays as boring and out of style. Terence then proceeds to defend his work, probably ultimately submitting it to the judgement of the audience, who then viewed a performance of one of his plays. The play was probably mimed while the Terence character recited it, "in the manner thought to be characteristic of actual Roman performances."&lt;ref&gt;Manso, 116, quoting Tydeman, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The short piece testifies, however, to the lack of certainty about ancient practice. ''An sit prosaicum nescio an metricum'' says the producer about the drama of [[Plautus]]: "we do not know whether they may be prose or meter."&lt;ref&gt;Menéndez y Pelayo, chapt. 7; Segal, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Terentius et delusor'' was given its first modern edition, with annotations, by [[Charles Magnin]] in the ''[[Bibliothèque de l'École des Chartes]]'' (vol. 1:1839&amp;ndash;40, pp.&amp;nbsp;517&amp;ndash;535), where he titled it "Fragment d'un comique inédit du septième siècle" (Fragment of an unedited comedy of the seventh century). Next, Paul von Winterfeld edited the poem for ''Hrotsvithae Opera'', xx&amp;ndash;xxiii, in [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica|MGH SS rerum Germanicarum]] (Berlin: 1902). An updated version was made by Karl Strecker for MGH, ''Poetae Latini aevi Carolini'', IV, 1088&amp;ndash;90, in 1923 and for ''Hrotsvithae Opera'' in 1930. It has since appeared (without translation) in Appendix V, 326&amp;ndash;328, of volume II of E. K. Chambers' ''The Medieval Stage''.

'''''The Naked Archaeologist''''' was a television show produced for [[VisionTV]] in Canada and [[History International]] in the US, that was hosted and prepared by the [[Emmy Award]]–winning journalist [[Simcha Jacobovici]] together with [[Avri Gilad]]. The show ultimately reviews [[Bible|Biblical]] stories, then tries to find proof for them by exploring the [[Holy Land]] looking for archaeological evidence, personal inferences, deductions, and interviews with scholars and experts.

Subsequent to its original run on [[VisionTV]], it was picked up in the U.S. by [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] and its sister network, [[History International]].

The third and final season began airing on Vision TV on March 22, 2010 and on History International on November 8, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.alphatrade.com/story/2010-03-04/CNW/201003041149CANADANWCANADAPR_C6913.html |title=Beasts of the Bible: Biblical myth-busting meets investigative archaeology in state-of-the-art documentary special, premiering March 31|website=Alphatrade.com|date=March 5, 2010|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cnote2|C|Several durations are given by sources, including 38,&lt;ref name=hernon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Haws /&gt; 40&lt;ref name=Jacopetti /&gt; and 45&lt;ref name=Gordon /&gt; minutes, but the 38 minute duration is the most often quoted. The variation is due to confusion over what actually constitutes the start and end of a war.  Some sources take the start of the war as the order to open fire at 09:00 and some with the start of actual firing at 09:02.  The end of the war is usually put at 09:40 when the last shots were fired and the palace flag struck, but some sources place it at 09:45.  The logbooks of the British ships also suffer from this with ''St George'' indicating that cease-fire was called and Khalid entered the German consulate at 09:35, ''Thrush'' at 09:40, ''Racoon'' at 09:41 and ''Philomel'' and ''Sparrow'' at 09:45.&lt;ref name=Patience /&gt;}}

==Uluru Statement from the Heart==


:"We, gathered at the 2017 National Constitutional Convention, coming from all points of the southern sky, make this statement from the heart:

:Our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tribes were the first sovereign Nations of the Australian continent and its adjacent islands, and possessed it under our own laws and customs. This our ancestors did, according to the reckoning of our culture, from the Creation, according to the common law from ‘time immemorial’, and according to science more than 60,000 years ago.

:This sovereignty is a spiritual notion: the ancestral tie between the land, or ‘mother nature’, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who were born therefrom, remain attached thereto, and must one day return thither to be united with our ancestors. This link is the basis of the ownership of the soil, or better, of sovereignty. It has never been ceded or extinguished, and co-exists with the sovereignty of the Crown.

:How could it be otherwise? That peoples possessed a land for sixty millennia and this sacred link disappears from world history in merely the last two hundred years?

:With substantive constitutional change and structural reform, we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia’s nationhood.

:Proportionally, we are the most incarcerated people on the planet. We are not an innately criminal people. Our children are aliened from their families at unprecedented rates. This cannot be because we have no love for them. And our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers. They should be our hope for the future.

:These dimensions of our crisis tell plainly the structural nature of our problem. This is the torment of our powerlessness.

:We seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country. When we have power over our destiny our children will flourish. They will walk in two worlds and their culture will be a gift to their country.

:We call for the establishment of a First Nations Voice enshrined in the Constitution.

:Makarrata is the culmination of our agenda: the coming together after a struggle. It captures our aspirations for a fair and truthful relationship with the people of Australia and a better future for our children based on justice and self-determination.

:We seek a Makarrata Commission to supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations and truth-telling about our history.

:In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard. We leave base camp and start our trek across this vast country. We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11909">In [[medieval Serbia]] a social group known as "[[Vlachs]]" ({{lang-sr|Власи/Vlasi}}) existed.

==Background==
===Romance elements in the early Byzantine period===
{{see also|Illyro-Roman|Daco-Roman|Thraco-Roman}}
Following Roman withdrawal from the province of [[Dacia]] at the end of the 3rd century, the name of the Roman region was changed to [[Dacia Aureliana]], (later [[Dacia Ripensis]]); it extended over most of what is now Serbia and Bulgaria, and an undetermined number of [[Thraco-Roman|Romanized Dacians]] were settled there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ukf-lEYl3FUC&amp;pg=PR3| title=Aurelian and the Third Century| last=Watson| first=Alaric| publisher=Psychology Press| year=2003| pages=155| isbn=9780203167809}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong Roman presence persisted in the region through the end of [[Justinian I|Justinian's I]] reign in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=William Rosen| title=Justinian's Flea: Plague, Empire, and the Birth of Europe| publisher=Viking Adult| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}

===Amalgamation of Slavs and Romans===
The Slavs, settling the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries, absorbed the Romanized populations over the centuries. Some Romance placenames survived Slavicization, such as the names of rivers and mountains. The Old Roman culture was preserved mainly in maritime [[Dalmatia]], while Eastern, Greek influence and linguistics prevailed in the hinterland. The linguistical border roughly went from [[Lezhë]], below the [[Shkodër]]-Prizren road towards Lipljan and Skopje, and then towards Sofia. The Roman element in the inlands retreated into the mountains with the Slavic incursions, however, larger areas of Roman elements were preserved in some parts of inland Balkans, such as in southern Macedonia and in Carpathian regions. Romance shepherd terminology were preserved in certain areas of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The Slavs, due to their large numbers and abundance of reserves, easily assimilated the Roman population due to the deteriorating state of the Roman Empire. The Serbs came under the Latin sphere of influence, and first came into contact with Christianity through these contacts. Serbs adopted many Latin terms, part of the vocabulary still today. With time, ties between the Slavs and Romans of the Balkans became more tighter, the larger numbered Slavs absorbing the largest part of the Roman population in the Western Balkans. The Vlach shepherds completely mixed with the Serbs, a result of the predominant pastoralist society and Christianity. Romans for long held themselves separately in the city municipalities on the coast, however, after the 10th century the Slavic inflow strengthened and subsequently the maritime cities had more or less Slavic character (such as Dubrovnik and Split, becoming holders of Slavic culture and literature in the 14th and 15th centuries). As anthropologist J. Erdeljanović noted, Serbs received cultural elements from the Vlachs, such as the stone house and cottage, parts of folk costumes, some shepherd terminology and likely some shepherding skills. Combinations of Slavic–Romance nomenclature were preserved in higher mountainous areas, and with the many migrations from the mountains into the lowlands northwards, most of the preserved old Balkan characteristics were merged into the general characteristics of all or larger parts of Serbs and Croats from the Adriatic and to the Timok river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ćorović|first=Vladimir|authorlink=Vladimir Ćorović|year=2001|origyear=1997|title=Историја српског народа|url=http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/index.html|chapter=Балканска култура у доба сеобе Словена|chapter-url=http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/1_4.html|language=Serbian|publisher=Јанус|location=[[Belgrade]]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social class==
{{see also|Sebri}}
The ''vlasi'' (власи) or ''pastiri'' (пастири) were dependent shepherds in the medieval Serbian state, part of the ''[[sebri]]'' social class.{{sfn|Šarkić|1996|p=31}} The multitude and likely prevalence of ''[[Vlachs]]'' (Romanized remnants) among the shepherds made the term "Vlachs" a [[synonym]] for shepherds, similarly as the term ''Srbljin'' was sporadically used for farmers.{{sfn|Jevtić|Popović|2000|p=46}} The status of the ''vlasi'' was basically equal to the ''meropsi''.{{sfn|Jevtić|Popović|2000|p=46}}

==Vlachs in Nemanjić charters==

The first mention of "Vlachs" in Serbian historical sources is the Hilandar founding charter (1198–99) by [[Stefan Nemanja]]. 170 Vlach families were mentioned, granted together with villages and churches. Romance names were identified through ''de Radu i Đurđa''.&lt;ref name="Zef"&gt;{{cite book| author=Zef Mirdita| title=Balkanski Vlasi u svijetlu podataka Bizantskih autora| url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=157940| publisher=Croatian History Institute| location=Zagreb| year=1995| pages=27-31 (Serbian), 31-33 (Crusades)| language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nemanja's son, [[Stefan the First-Crowned]], granted the [[Žiča]] monastery with 200 Vlach families from [[Prokletije]] mountain, near [[Peć]], Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; In 1220, king Stefan proclaimed that all Vlachs of his kingdom belonged to the [[Eparchy of Žiča]].&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; Vlach counts (''comes catuni'' or ''catunarius'') were mentioned in Hvosno in 1220, 1282–98 and 1302–09.&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; Crusader chronicles describe encounters with Vlachs in various parts of modern Serbia in the 12th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; King [[Stefan Uroš I of Serbia]] granted the Hilandar monastery with another 30 Vlach families from the [[Drin (river)|Drim]] river.&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; In the grant (around 1280) by his wife and queen, [[Helen of Anjou]], which confirmed the grant given by [[Stefan Vladislav]] to the [[Vranjina Monastery|Vranjina monastery]], the Vlachs are separately mentioned, along with [[Names of the Albanians and Albania#Arbanas|Arbanasi]] (Albanians), Latins and Serbs.&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; King [[Stefan Milutin]]'s charter to the [[Banjska monastery|Banjska]] monastery granted it with six ''katuns'' (highland hamlets), and also made the first mention of the "[[Vlach law]]" (''zakon Vlahom'').&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; In 1330, King [[Stefan Dečanski]] granted the [[Visoki Dečani]] monastery with pasture land along with Vlach and Albanian katuns around Drim and [[Lim (river)|Lim]] rivers of whom had to carry salt and provide serf labour for the  monastery.&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malcolm1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Kosovo: A short history|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780810874831|page=54}} "From the details of the monastic estates given in the chrysobulls, further information can be gleaned about these Vlachs and Albanians. The earliest reference is in one of Nemanja’s charters giving property to Hilandar, the Serbian monastery on Mount Athos: 170 Vlachs are mentioned, probably located in villages round Prizren. When Dečanski founded his monastery of Dečani in 1330, he referred to ‘villages and katuns of Vlachs and Albanians’ in the area of the white Drin: a katun (alb.:katund) was a shepherding settlement."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkinson183&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Henry Robert|title=Jugoslav Kosmet: The evolution of a frontier province and its landscape|jstor=621279|journal=Transactions and Papers (Institute of British Geographers)|volume=21|issue=|year=1955|pages=183|ref=harv}} "The monastery at Dečani stands on a terrace commanding passes into High Albania. When Stefan Uros III founded it in 1330, he gave it many villages in the plain and catuns of Vlachs and Albanians between the Lim and the Beli Drim. Vlachs and Albanians had to carry salt for the monastery and provide it with serf labour."&lt;/ref&gt; Granting monasteries with Vlachs continued during the reign of Emperor [[Stefan Uroš V]] (1355–71), in his charter as members of the Church of [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć|St. Nicholas]] in Hvosno, and 30 Vlach families as servants of [[Gračanica monastery|Gračanica]] monastery, Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt;

According to Croatian-Albanian historian Zef Mirdita, despite the fact that the "Vlach" exonym partially meant shepherds as a socio-professional category (regardless of ethnos), the individuality and identity of the Vlachs are seen in the Banjska and Dečani charters, as well as in [[Dušan's Code]] (1349).&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; Therein is included a prohibition of intermarriage between Serbs and Vlachs,&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; while after Emperor Dušan conquered a large part of southeast Europe (including [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]], that is [[Great Vlachia]], and Albania, with significant Vlach population) he clearly differs Vlachs from Serbs and [[Albanians]].&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; An article provides that in the case of conflict between villagers it is punishable with a fine of 50 [[Serbian perper|perper]], while among Vlachs and Arbanasi of 100 perper.&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; Another article, ''on the Vlachs and Arbanasi'', prohibits the overnight stay by other shepherds in villages of Vlachs or Arbanasi, and in the case they did, have to pay for the amount their herds graze.&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt; Dušan's charters of the [[Monastery of the Holy Archangels]] and Hilandar mention the Vlach duties of shepherding and giving sheep, up to two horses every year or 30 perper, as transporters for salt and other stuff monastery needs, [[Mower|mowing]] [[hay]], and being construction workers.&lt;ref name="Zef"/&gt;

The medieval Vlachs in the Balkans had hybrid names, evidenting intermarriage with the Slavs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biblioteka Etnološkog društva Jugoslavije|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QJoAAAAIAAJ|year=1962|publisher=Etnološko društvo Jugoslavije.|quote=Što se tiče narodnosti sredovječnih Vlaha, držim, da jedino tipovi imena kaošto su 1) Rad i 2) sa članom Radul, dozvoljavaju pouzdan zaključak, da su Vlasi onoga vremena bili dvojezičan narod (bilingues), jer se samo ovako mogu razumjeti ove hibridne pojave". Skok je ujedno utvrdio i veoma značajnu činjenicu da su balkanski Vlasi preuzeli i slovenski onomastičfki sistem, jer u izvorima srednjeg vijeka preovlađuju imena koja pokazuju „ne samo slovenska kompozita, nego i slovenske sufikse -an, -oje, ilo". Zatim bi slijedila slovenska imena tipa Rad, Braik, Neg, koja su Vlasi oblikovali prema svojim imenima Bun, Bukur, i najzad poneko rumunsko ime koje se javlja u osnovi prezimena sa nastavkom ić, ović, kao Bun — Bunišić, Žur — Žurović. Meni se čini da hibnidnost vlaško-islovenskih i slovensko-vlaških imena u izvorima srednjeg vijeka ukazuje u prvom redu na hibridne brakove, &gt;tj. na ženidbene veze između vlaškog i slovenskog stanovništva. Slovenska hipokoristična imena ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vryburg''' ([[Afrikaans]] for ''free borough'') is a large agricultural [[town]] with a population of 48,200 situated in the [[Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District Municipality]] of the [[North West Province (South Africa)|North West Province]] of [[South Africa]]. It is the seat and the industrial and agricultural heartland of the district of the [[Bophirima]] region.

== Location ==
The town is situated halfway between [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]] (the capital of the [[Northern Cape Province]]) and [[Mahikeng]] (the capital of the [[North West Province (South Africa)|North West Province]]). 

Vryburg is on [[Cecil Rhodes]]’s great northern railroad, which ran from [[Cape Town]] through the Kimberley [[Kimberley diamond fields|diamond fields]], Vryburg, Mafikeng, and northwards beyond [[Victoria Falls]]. It is also on the [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14 National Road]] which runs from [[Gauteng Province]] in a southwesterly direction through Vryburg, [[Kuruman]] and [[Upington]] to the mining town of [[Springbok, Northern Cape|Springbok]] in the North-western Cape. This road also connects Gauteng Province with [[Namibia]].

The township of Huhudi ([[Tswana language|Tswana]] for "running water") is situated just south of the town. 

== History ==
===Capital of a Republic===
The name ''Vryburg'' comes from the period in the 1882 when Vryburg was established as the capital of the [[Stellaland|Republic of Stellaland]].  The Republicans called themselves ''Vryburgers'' ("free citizens"), and since the Afrikaans word for "citizen" is "burger" and the word for "borough" is "burg" the name of the town followed.&lt;ref name="Appletons-3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1896-1902.|publisher=Appletons|location=New York|year=1901|series=3|volume=5|pages=3|url=https://archive.org/stream/s3appletonsann05newyuoft#page/3/mode/1up|accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first and only president was [[G.J. van Niekerk]].  A site for the township was selected and named Endvogelfontein. On 15 November the same year, the name was changed to Vryburg. In December that year, newly laid out plots were apportioned to the volunteers by means of a lottery and by February 1883 some 400 farms had been established. On 16 August 1883, Administrator Van Niekerk proclaimed the Republic of Stellaland with Vryburg as capital and himself as President.  

By 1884 the town consisted of around 20 houses.&lt;ref name="convention-1884-30"&gt;{{cite book|last=Great Britain|title=South African Republic: A Convention Between Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Republic of South Africa|publisher=Great Britain|location=London|year=1884|pages=30|url=https://archive.org/stream/southafricanrep00britgoog#page/n53/mode/1up|accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stellaland split into two rival factions – those who supported annexation into the [[Cape Colony]] as mooted by [[Cecil Rhodes]], and those who preferred independence. {{Cn|date=June 2016}}

===British Bechuanaland===

In February 1884, the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention]] was signed, making Stellaland a British protectorate, with the Reverend John McKenzie appointed Commissioner to British Bechuanaland. 

In 1885, the [[United Kingdom|British]] seized the town and incorporated the area into [[British Bechuanaland]], which in turn became part of the [[Cape Colony]] in 1895.

Vryburg today is the industrial and agricultural capital of the Bophirima (Western) region.

===Concentration Camp===
During the [[Second Boer War]], the British built a [[concentration camp]] here to house [[Boer]] women and children.  

===London Missionary Society===

The [[Tiger Kloof Educational Institute|Tiger Kloof Native Institute]] was set up south of the town by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1904. A cornerstone for the building of the institute was laid in 1905 by the [[William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne|Earl of Selborne]].&lt;ref name="hawkins-63"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Frank H|title=Through lands that were dark : being a record of a year's missionary journey in Africa and Madagascar|publisher=London Missionary Society|location=London|year=1914|pages=63|chapter=III - Tiger Kloof - "A Lamp Shining in a Dark Place"|url=https://archive.org/stream/throughlandsthat00hawkiala#page/63/mode/1up|accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone church on the premises is a [[National heritage sites (South Africa)|national monument]].

===Colony to Province===
By 1910, the Cape Colony became the [[Cape Province]], one of the four provinces of the [[Union of South Africa]] and later the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]].  When nine provinces were established in 1994, Vryburg finally became part of the [[North West Province (South Africa)|North West Province]].

==Economy==
===Beef production===
[[File:Station Vryburg NW.JPG|thumb|Vryburg railway station]]
Vryburg is South Africa's largest [[beef]] producing district, with [[Bonsmara]] cattle the most popular.  {{Cn|date=June 2016}} It is sometimes called "the [[Texas]] of South Africa".

===Other produce===
[[Maize]] and [[peanut]]s are important [[crops]] produced in the district. The town hosts South Africa's third largest agricultural show.

The town today is an industrial and agricultural hub. Its modern architecture blends naturally with its surroundings and the well-preserved old buildings are carefully maintained.

==Transport==
There are roads, rail and air connections to all the major centers in the country. Vryburg is also situated on the main railway lines from [[Cape Town]] to [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

The town is served by [[Vryburg Airport]].

==Culture==

The [[Theiler Museum]] on the farm Armoedsvlakte, 8&amp;nbsp;km west of Vryburg, holds a collection of equipment used by [[Arnold Theiler|Sir Arnold Theiler]], the [[veterinarian]] who established the [[Onderstepoort]] veterinary research institute near [[Pretoria]].

==Fauna and flora==
The [[Leon Taljaard Nature Reserve]] is located north west of the town with the Swartfontein resort located adjacent to the reserve. The reserve has a number of animal species including [[Rhino]], [[Common eland|Eland]], [[African buffalo|Buffalo]], [[Black wildebeest|Black Wildebeest]], [[Waterbuck]] and [[Springbuck]]. It is open daily to the public.

[[Image:SirWilliamSearleHoldsworth.jpg|thumb|Sir William Searle Holdsworth]]
'''Sir William Searle Holdsworth''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OM|KC|FBA}} (7 May 1871 – 2 January 1944), was [[Vinerian Professor of English Law]] at [[Oxford University]] and a legal historian, amongst whose works is the 17 volume ''History of English Law''.

==Biography==
Holdsworth was born in [[Beckenham]], Kent in 1871, the son of a well-known London solicitor, Charles Joseph Holdsworth and his wife Ellen Caroline (née Searle).&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Bar Association (1923), ''The Canadian Bar Review'', Page 362, (Canadian Bar Association)&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Dulwich College]] and in 1890 went on to win a History Exhibition from Dulwich College to [[New College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;(1944) ''The Law Quarterly Review'', (Stevens)&lt;/ref&gt; He took first-class honours both in History and in Law,&lt;ref&gt;(1965) ''The Law Journal'', Page 9&lt;/ref&gt; and second class honours in the [[Bachelor of Civil Law|BCL]].&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Hanbury, 'Holdsworth, Sir William Searle (1871–1944)', rev. David Ibbetson, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 ;online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33933, accessed 21 Nov 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; He was called to the bar at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1896.

Holdsworth's main work, with a first edition of the first book in 1903, was ''A History of English Law'', gradually expanded to cover everything from Ancient Britain to 1875 over his career. Holdsworth became Professor of Constitutional Law at [[University College, London|University College]], London (1903 to 1908). In 1922 he became the [[Vinerian Professor of English Law]] at [[Oxford]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. Copyright 2007 Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Charles Dickens as a Legal Historian'' (1928, repr. 1972), a book version of Holdsworth's Storrs Lectures at Yale Law School, he argued that historians should pay closer attention to the novels of Charles Dickens as source material about the workings of English law and legal institutions; it contains a thoughtful and sensitive analysis of Dickens's novel ''Bleak House'' as an illuminating examination of the Chancery system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In ''Some Makers of English Law'' (Cambridge University Press, 1938), reprinting the Tagore Lectures delivered in 1937–1938 at Calcutta University, Holdsworth offered an overview of the history of English law through biographical studies of key figures in that history. Holdsworth was knighted in 1929 and was appointed as a member of the [[Order of Merit]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page1747.asp/   Royal Insight:GREAT BRITONS: CELEBRATING THE CENTENARY OF THE ORDER OF MERIT]&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1944. There are portraits of Sir William Holdsworth by [[Alexander Bassano|Bassano]] in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp64690 National Portrait Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; and his portrait in pastels by E. Plachter can be seen in the Holdsworth Room of [[St John's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="St John’s College Oxford" /&gt;

==''A History of English Law''==
''A History of English Law'', eventually comprising 17 volumes, published between 1903 and 1966, was Holdsworth's greatest literary academic achievement. The work begins with Anglo-Saxon times, and it is an account of legal procedure and court organisation down to the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1875 and of the important phases of substantive law through the 18th century.

Holdsworth's history has been criticised as involving lapses from full modern scholarly standards, and is consequently treated with some caution by some current legal historians.&lt;ref&gt;Cosgrove, Richard A., "The Culture of Academic Legal History: Lawyers' History and Historians' Law 1870-1930", 33 Cambrian L. Rev. 23–34 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societies==

===Holdsworth Club===
The Holdsworth Club is the [[University of Birmingham]] Law School's student law society. The Holdsworth Club was founded in 1927 and named after Sir William Holdsworth, by Professor C.E. Smalley-Baker who served as the first Dean of the [[University of Birmingham]]'s Faculty of Law between 1928 and 1949.&lt;ref&gt;University of Birmingham, (2005), ''LLM Taught Masters programmes in Law'', Page 22, (University of Birmingham)&lt;/ref&gt; Sir William Holdsworth was Smalley-Baker's mentor and had been an External Examiner at the University for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holdsworthclub.org  The Holdsworth Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

After giving his name to the Law Faculty's Student Club (the names of Bacon, Coke and Blackstone having been considered and rejected); Sir William Holdsworth became its active Patron. In this role he attended and spoke at the Club's annual dinner, and he gave an annual presidential address. The establishment of the presidency of the Holdsworth Club as an annual office, involving the sole obligations of attending a dinner and giving a lecture, led to the Faculty gaining a distinguished line of visiting speakers, (which by 1948 already included two [[Lord Chancellor]]s and two [[Master of the Rolls|Masters of the Rolls]]).

Sir William Holdsworth remained patron of the club until his death in 1944 (after which there have been two more patrons:  Dean Smalley-Baker 1949–72; and Professor [[Owen Hood-Phillips]] 1974–86). The list of distinguished presidents includes lord chancellors, such as [[Viscount Hailsham|Hailsham]], [[Viscount Hailsham|father]] and [[Viscount Hailsham|son]], [[Master of the Rolls]], [[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Denning]] (three times); [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Donaldson]]; [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Bingham]]; [[Sir Wilfred Greene|Green]], the majority of the great [[law lords]] of the 20th century and academic lawyers such as the international lawyer Sir [[Arnold McNair]] and the American jurist [[Roscoe Pound|Dean Roscoe Pound]] to whom the Golden Medal of the American Bar Association was awarded for "conspicuous service to the cause of American jurisprudence" was presented in 1940. This medal is still worn by Holdsworth presidents when delivering their address. The vice-president of the club is Mr George Applebey, lecturer at law.&lt;ref&gt;John Bosworth , (1987), ''History of the Birmingham Law Faculty, the First Sixty Years''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holdsworth Society===
The Holdsworth Society is the College Law Society of [[St John's College, Oxford]]. The Committee consists of the President (the previous year's Secretary), the Secretary and the Librarian. The Holdsworth Society attracts a high calibre of guest speaker, and also hosts termly black tie dinners. The social highlight of the Society's year is undoubtedly the Alumni Dinner, which is held in Hall at the end of Hilary Term.

The St John's College Law Library is named The Holdsworth Library after Sir William Searle Holdsworth, Fellow of St. John's 1897–1922 and Vinerian Professor of Law, and later Honorary Fellow. His portrait in pastels by E. Plachter can be seen there.&lt;ref name="St John’s College Oxford"&gt;[http://129.67.60.7/index.php?A=14&amp;B=70/    St John’s College Oxford]&lt;/ref&gt;

All initiates to the Holdsworth Society must take a solemn Sacramentum in order to be admitted to the Final Honour Schools programme, a peculiarity of St John's College's requirements for enrolment. The taking of the Holdsworth Sacramentum represents an important moment in an undergraduate's life, for until it is completed they cannot officially progress beyond Moderations (first year examinations) and be considered for the BA Jurisprudence.
