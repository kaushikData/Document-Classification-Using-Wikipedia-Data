'''BadJocks.com''' is a [[website]] that covers sports-related misconduct and crime at all levels, from [[Professional sports|professional]] to children's, by not only the [[sportsperson|athlete]]s themselves but [[coach (sport)|coaches]] and spectators as well. Creator and content provider [[Bob Reno]] has since 2000 written daily items on not only well-covered events such as the [[2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal|rape charges against three Duke lacrosse players]] and the [[2005 Minnesota Vikings boat cruise scandal|Minnesota Vikings "love boat" scandal]] but less-reported local events as well, with [[video]] clips sometimes included. While the site's news and audience are primarily U.S.-based, foreign news, particularly [[soccer]]-related, has been covered as well. He bills the site as "'''Where ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'' Meets ''[[SportsCenter]]'''''". In 2008 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose the site as one of 25 in its first annual blog index,&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bad Jocks|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1725323_1725329_1725407,00.html|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=2008-04-09|accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named the site one of the decade's five most influential blogs.&lt;ref name="SI most influential"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Graham|first=Byran Armen|title=Best of decade: movies, TV shows, books, blogs (cont.)|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/magazine/specials/2000s/12/07/movies.tv.books.blogs/1.html#ixzz0ZQ1MAWCV|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the site's tone is light-hearted, featuring Reno's acerbic commentary on the various occurrences culled from other media. Reno keeps an annual tally of several types of stories that occur on frequent basis each year, with three ("[[Drunkenness|drunken]] outbursts", "naughty [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]]" and "[[streaking|streakers]] and [[nudity|naked people]]" at the moment) typifying much of the content. However, the fourth, [[high school]] coach sex scandals, have been treated more and more seriously by Reno as many involve [[ephebophilia|relations between adults and students]], and he was taken aback when these numbers regularly approached 200 each year, so much that he stopped keeping count in 2007. He has sometimes posted commentary and analysis of the phenomenon, with input from readers. He followed the [[Pamela Rogers Turner]] case closely since she was a [[physical education|gym]] teacher, and also the [[Debra Lafave]] case, which like non-athletics-related scandals he had devoted considerable space to on BadJocks's sister site, [[DumbAssDaily.com]]. In the former, Reno posted a cell-phone cam video of Rogers dancing provocatively, one of several attempts to contact her victim that had gotten her [[parole]] revoked, as well as her [[MySpace]], which officials there had taken down.

==College hazing pictures==

In 2005, Reno began searching on [[Webshots]] using the [[search string]]s "[[initiation]]" or, less frequently, "[[hazing]]". These eventually yielded albums of members of various [[College athletics|colleges' sports teams]] putting [[freshman]] members through hazing rituals. Many of these involved women's teams, and Reno posted the pictures on his website in case the originals were taken down. Most featured the players wearing [[lingerie]] outside their clothes and with various things, some obscene, written on their bodies with marker as they performed some humiliating task. [[The Catholic University of America]] was seriously embarrassed by photos showing their school's [[women's lacrosse]] team cavorting with a [[G-string|thong]]-clad male [[Striptease|stripper]], and later suspended the entire team for three games.[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2543418]

Since some showed [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption by students who were [[legal drinking age|underage]], in violation of liquor laws and school policies, [[Criminal procedure|investigation]]s were started by the respective colleges. Most stopped short of finding any serious wrongdoing and gave the students involved the benefit of the doubt.

However, in May 2006 a reader of the site found pictures of the [[Northwestern University]] [[Women's football (soccer)|women's soccer]] team putting its freshmen through hazing more serious than other colleges, and Reno posted them. The young women were shown drinking [[tequila]] and other [[hard liquor]] and going through similar rituals as their counterparts elsewhere, with [[penis]]es drawn on them in marker. In some shots, though, they were [[blindfold]]ed had their hands tied behind their backs with [[duct tape]] and were apparently performing simulated sex acts and giving fully clothed [[lap dance]]s to players on the men's soccer team.

Other sites started making similar searches and posting the results. Reno merely linked to those, but the media often mistakenly credited BadJocks anyway.

The publication of the photos led to the coach's resignation. Northwestern [[Suspension (punishment)|suspended]] the team. Reno and the site earned national attention. Many commentators said they were profoundly shocked to see women engaging in such degrading conduct.

BadJocks became so closely associated with the hazing pictures and the ensuing scandals that, in April 2007, the [[University of Minnesota at Duluth]]'s athletic director specifically referred to it when explaining a new request that student-athletes not use [[Facebook]] or [[MySpace]][http://www.startribune.com/503/story/1111230.html]. Reno responded that he doesn't troll either site and usually finds the pictures, if he's the one to do so, on Webshots.

'''Bicycle suspension''' is the system, or systems, used to ''suspend'' the rider and bicycle in order to insulate them from the roughness of the terrain. Bicycle suspension is used primarily on [[mountain bike]]s, but is also common on [[hybrid bicycle]]s.

Bicycle suspension can be implemented in a variety of ways, and any combination thereof:
*Front suspension
*Rear suspension
*Suspension [[seatpost]]
*Suspension [[bicycle saddle|saddle]]
*Suspension [[Stem (bicycle part)|stem]] (now uncommon)
*Suspension [[Bicycle hub#Hub|hub]]

Bicycles with only front suspension are referred to as '''hardtail''' and bicycles with suspension in both the front and rear are referred to as '''dual or full suspension bikes'''. When a bicycle has no suspension it is called '''rigid'''. Bicycles with only rear suspension are uncommon although the [[Brompton Bicycle|Brompton]] folding bicycle is equipped with rear only suspension.

Although a stiffer frame is usually preferable{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}, no material is infinitely stiff and therefore any frame will exhibit some flexing. Bicycle designers intentionally make frames in such a way that the frame itself can absorb some vibrations.

Besides providing comfort to the rider, suspension systems improve [[traction (engineering)|traction]] and safety by helping to keep one or both wheels in contact with the ground.

==History==
[[File:Whippet Safety Bicycle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|1885 Whippet safety bicycle]]
As early as 1885, the [[Whippet (bicycle)|Whippet]] brand of [[safety bicycle]] was notable for its use of springs to suspend the frame.&lt;ref name="herlihy"&gt;{{cite book

==Front suspension==
[[File:MountainbikeSuspensionFork 2010 RockShox Dart3.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Suspension fork with 100&amp;nbsp;mm travel on a cross-country mountain bike]]
[[File:Cannondale Lefty Fork.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Lefty shock#Suspension Forks|Cannondale Lefty]] fork]]
===Telescopic===
Front suspension is often implemented using a [[Motorcycle fork#Telescopic|telescopic (i.e., telescoping) fork]]. The specifics of the suspension depend on the type of mountain biking the fork is designed for and is generally categorized by the amount of travel. For instance, manufacturers produce different forks for [[Cross-country cycling|cross-country]] (XC), [[Downhill mountain biking|downhill]] (DH), [[freeride]] (FR) and [[Enduro (Mountain-biking)|enduro]] (ND) riding which all have different demands for amount of travel, weight, durability, strength, and handling characteristics.

Telescopic suspension forks have become increasingly sophisticated. The amount of travel available has typically increased. When suspension forks were introduced, 80–100&amp;nbsp;mm of travel was deemed sufficient for a downhill mountain bike. This amount of travel is now common for cross-country disciplines, whereas downhill forks typically offer 200&amp;nbsp;mm of travel for handling the most extreme terrain.

Other advances in design include adjustable travel, allowing riders to adapt the fork's travel to the specific terrain (e.g. less travel for uphill or paved sections, more travel for downhill sections). Many forks feature the ability to lock out the travel. This completely eliminates or drastically reduces the fork's travel for more efficient riding over smooth sections of terrain. The lockout can sometimes be remotely controlled by a lever on the handlebars via a mechanical cable, or even through electronics.

As with all [[shock absorber]]s it usually consists of two parts: a [[spring (device)|spring]], and a [[dashpot|damper]]. The spring may be implemented with a steel or titanium coil, compressed air, or even an elastomer. Different spring materials have different [[spring constant|spring rates]] which have a fundamental effect on the characteristics of the fork as a whole. Coil-sprung forks keep an approximately constant ("linear") spring rate throughout their travel. The spring rate of air-sprung forks however increases with travel, making them progressive. Titanium coils are much lighter but much more expensive. Air-sprung forks are generally lighter still.

Air springs work by using the characteristic of compressed air to resist further compression. As the spring itself is provided by the compressed air rather than a coil of metal it is much lighter; this makes their use popular in cross country designs. Another advantage of this type of fork design is that the spring rate can easily be adjusted by changing the air pressure within the fork. This allows a fork to be effectively tuned to a rider's weight. To achieve this in a coil sprung fork, one would have to swap out different coils with different [[spring constant|spring rates]]. However air pressure naturally controls both spring rate and preload at the same time, requiring air forks to have additional systems to adjust preload separately, adding to its complexity. Another disadvantage of air-sprung forks is the difficulty in achieving a linear spring rate throughout the fork's action. As the fork compresses, the air held inside is compressed. Towards the end of the fork's travel, further compression of the fork requires ever greater force. This results in an increase in spring rate and gives the fork its progressive feel. Increasing the volume of the air inside the spring reduces this effect but the volume of the spring is ultimately limited by the need to be contained within the fork. The use of two air chambers within the system has allowed a more linear feel to air suspension, this is achieved by having a 'reserve' chamber that becomes connected to the main chamber when it reaches a certain amount of compression. Once achieved, a valve opens and effectively makes the chamber larger. By linking the two, the force needed to compress the air in the chambers is reduced which reduces the exponential spring rate feel traditionally associated with air systems when approaching the end of the suspension's travel.

The amount of preload on coil-sprung forks can generally be adjusted by turning a knob on top of one of the fork legs. Air sprung designs have various ways of dealing with preload. Several systems have been designed to influence preload, such as separately pressurizing different chambers, or systems that automatically set sag after changing the air pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A damper is usually implemented by forcing oil to pass through one or more small [[calibrated orifice|orifices]] (also called ports) or shim stacks. On some models the damper may be adjusted for rider weight, riding style, terrain, or any combination of these or other factors. The two components are often separated by housing the spring mechanism in one of the fork's legs and the damper in the other. Without a damper unit the system would rebound excessively and would actually give the rider less control than would a rigid fork.

To prevent water and dirt from damaging the suspension, [[Gaiter (vehicle)|gaiters]] have been used to cover the fork's stanchions. However even when properly sealing the stanchions and sliders, the gaiters have to have small openings in them to allow air to move in and out of the cavity between gaiter and stanchion as the fork moves through its travel. Some water and grit may find its way in through these holes, staying trapped inside and accumulating over time. Since modern dust wipers and seals keep out water and dirt adequately enough by themselves, and since gaiter-less stanchions are generally regarded as more aesthetically pleasing{{by whom|date=May 2014}}, gaiters have fallen out of favor.

===Alternatives===
Some manufacturers have tried other variations to the telescopic fork. For example, [[Cannondale Bicycle Corporation|Cannondale]] designed a shock absorber build into the steerer tube called HeadShok, and a single-sided fork with just one leg, called [[Lefty shock#Suspension Forks|Lefty]]. The stanchions of both systems are not round but have flat faces machined onto them which slide on needle bearings instead of bushings, this prevents the wheel from rotating in relation to the handlebars. Both of these systems claim to offer greater rigidity and better feel, with lighter weight. Others such as Proflex (Girvin), Whyte and [[BMW]], have made suspension forks that employ four-bar linkage systems instead of relying upon telescopic fork legs, much like BMW's [[Motorcycle fork#Hossack.2FFior .28Duolever.29|Duolever]]. The Suntour Swing Shock fork is based on a coil cantilevered swing set-up, and suspension is given by a coil spring which is located within the steerer tube and can be accessed from the top,&lt;ref name="srsuntour-cycling.com"&gt;http://www.srsuntour-cycling.com/dstore/products/Forks/3625/SWING+SHOCK/SW+S+700C.html&lt;/ref&gt; technology which was originally used for suspension on early motorcycles.

==Rear suspension==
Bicycles with rear suspension typically also have front suspension. [[Recumbent bicycles]] with suspension are an exception and often employ rear-only suspension.

Mountain bike suspension technology has made great advances since first appearing in the early 1990s. Early full suspension frames were heavy and tended to bounce up and down while a rider pedaled. This movement was called pedal bob, kickback, or monkey motion and took power out of a rider's pedal stroke &amp;mdash; especially during climbs up steep hills. Input from hard braking efforts also negatively affected early full suspension designs. When a rider hit the brakes, these early suspensions compressed into their travel and lost some of their ability to absorb bumps. This happened in situations where the rear suspension was needed most. When braking efforts cause the suspension to compress it is referred to as brake squat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Problems with pedal bob and brake jack began to be controlled in the early 1990s. One of the first successful full suspension bikes was designed by [[Mert Lawwill]], a former motorcycle champion.&lt;ref name="Bicycle Design: An Illustrated History"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CuoxAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA442&amp;dq=mert%20lawwill%20mountain%20bike&amp;pg=PA442#v=onepage&amp;q=mert%20lawwill%20mountain%20bike&amp;f=false |title=Bicycle Design: An Illustrated History |author=Hadland, Tony |publisher=Books.Google.com |year=2014 |work= |accessdate=2 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His bike, the Gary Fisher RS-1, was released in 1992. Its rear suspension adapted the [[Control arm|A-arm suspension design]] from sports car racing, and was the first [[four-bar linkage]] in mountain biking.&lt;ref name="Bicycle Design: An Illustrated History"/&gt; This design reduced the twin problems of unwanted braking and pedaling input to the rear wheel, but the design wasn't flawless. Problems remained with suspension action under acceleration, and the RS-1 couldn't use traditional cantilever brakes since the rear axle, and thus rim, moved in relation to the chainstays and seatstays. A lightweight, powerful disc brake wasn't developed until the mid-1990s, and the disc brake used on the RS-1 was its downfall.

Horst Leitner began working on the problem of chain torque and its effect on suspension in the mid-1970s with motorcycles. In 1985 Leitner built a prototype mountain bike incorporating what became known later as the "Horst link". The Horst Link is a type of [[four-bar linkage|four-bar]] suspension. Leitner formed a mountain bike and research company, AMP research, that began building full-suspension mountain bikes. In 1990, AMP introduced the Horst link as a feature of a "fully independent linkage" rear suspension for mountain bikes. The AMP B-3 and B-4 XC full-suspension bikes featured optional disc brakes and Horst link rear suspension very similar to the [[Macpherson strut]]. Note that the [[Four-bar linkage#Design of slider-crank mechanism|sliding piston]] in the shock absorber represents the fourth "bar" in this case. A later model, the B-5, was equipped with a revolutionary four-bar front suspension fork, as well as the Horst link in the rear. It featured up to 125&amp;nbsp;mm (5&amp;nbsp;inches) of travel on a bicycle weighing around 10.5&amp;nbsp;kg (23 pounds). For 10 years AMP Research manufactured their full-suspension bikes in small quantities in [[Laguna Beach, California]], including the manufacture of their own hubs, rear shocks, front suspension forks and cable-actuated-hydraulic disc brakes which they pioneered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of AMP Research|url=http://amp-research.com/company/history.asp |publisher=AMP Research|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soft tail===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Mountain bike]] --&gt;
A soft tail (also softail) relies on the flexing of the [[Bicycle frame#Chain stays|chainstays]] of a regular [[Bicycle frame#Diamond|diamond frame]] to create suspension travel, sometimes incorporating a specific flexing member within the chainstays. A shock absorber (or elastomer) is placed in line with the [[Bicycle frame#Steat stays|seat stays]] to allow the chainstays to move up and down, and for shock absorption. As the suspension moves through its travel the seat stay and shock absorber move out of alignment. This misalignment creates a [[lever|mechanical lever]] for suspension forces, causing torque on the joint between chain- and seatstays. This is an inherent structural disadvantage of the soft tail design and severely limits the amount of travel possible, typically around 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;inches. Soft tails have few moving parts and few pivot points making them simple and requiring little maintenance. Some notable examples include the [[KHS Bicycles|KHS]] Team Softail, [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]] STP and the [[Moots Cycles|Moots]] YBB. Some bikes (such as the Cannondale Scapel, Yeti ASR Carbon and older Yeti bikes) use a four-bar suspension design where one of the pivots is replaced by a flexing link.

===Unified rear triangle===
The unified rear triangle or "URT" for short, keeps the [[bottom bracket]] and rear axle directly connected at all times. Suspension action is provided between the rear triangle, which unites rear axle and bottom bracket, and the front triangle, which unites seat and front axle. This design uses only one pivot, which keeps the number of moving parts down. The fixed length between bottom bracket and rear axle gives the URT the advantage of zero chain growth and consistent front derailleur shifting. Additionally the bike is easily modified into a [[single speed|single-speed]]. However, as the URT's suspension moves, the distance between seat and pedals changes, detracting from pedaling efficiency. Furthermore, when the rider shifts any weight from the seat to the pedals, he or she is shifting weight from the sprung part of the bike to the unsprung parts. As such, part of the rider's weight is no longer suspended by the suspension system. Since pedaling itself is a shift of this weight, the design is very prone to suspension bob.

Notable examples of bikes with this type of suspension include the [[Ibis (bicycles)|Ibis]] Szazbo, [[Klein Bikes|Klein]] Mantra, [[Schwinn]] S-10, and [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]] Y.

===Single pivot===
[[File:SinglePivotSuspension 2008 Morewood Mbuzi-left.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|Single pivot suspension with 160&amp;nbsp;mm travel on a 2008 Morewood Mbuzi]]
The single pivot is the simplest type of rear suspension. The rear axle is held by a [[swingarm]] which is connected to the frame via a single pivot located near the bottom bracket. When the suspension moves through its travel, the path the rear axle describes is a circle around the pivot point. The rear triangle can be directly attached to the rear shock for a fairly linear leverage ratio between wheel travel and shock absorber travel.

The main advantage of the single pivot design is its simplicity. It has few moving parts, few pivot points, is relatively easy to design and has good small bump compliance. Challenges with this design are brake squat and chain growth.

Due to its simplicity, many inexpensive department store bikes use this design.

====Linkage driven single pivot====
[[File:MtbFrameGeometry FourBarLinkage.png|thumb|upright=1.0|Linkage driven single pivot rear suspension]]
Another implementation of the single pivot design attaches the swingarm to the shock via additional linkages, typically creating a [[four-bar linkage]] actuating ("driving") the shock to create a more progressive leverage ratio between wheel travel and shock absorber travel. This design is referred to as linkage driven single pivot, colloquially called faux-bar. It employs a four-bar linkage but the rear axle is held in a swingarm and still describes a circular axle path. The four-bar linkage serves only to actuate the shock and has no role in governing the axle path. Manufacturers of the linkage-driven single pivot often use the word "four-bar" in their marketing campaigns, which gave rise to the design's nickname "faux-bar".

Notable manufacturers well known for their long-time use of this suspension design include [[KHS Bicycles|KHS]], [[Kona Bicycle Company|Kona]], [[Jamis Bicycles|Jamis]], [[Diamondback Bicycles]] and older [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]] Fuels.

====High single pivot====
This variation of single pivot suspension places the pivot in front of and above the bottom bracket, at a height above the smallest chainring or higher. This gives the design a significant amount of [[Suspension (vehicle)#Anti-dive and anti-squat|anti-squat]] when pedaling in smaller chainrings, which helps reduce loss of energy due to squat. This is of particular importance on steep climbs, when one would use the smaller chainrings. However, this is a trade-off since the pivot's placement causes the design to suffer more from pedal kickback. Notable examples are Santa Cruz's Heckeler and Superlight as well as Orange's entire line of full suspensions.

===Split pivot===
The split pivot design is a special case of linkage-driven single pivot in which one of the four-bar's pivot points coincides with the rear axle. This allows for the disc brake caliper to be mounted on the floating linkage (also called coupler) instead of on the swingarm. As a result of this the braking torque now interacts with the suspension via the floating linkage. The linkages can be designed such that this has a positive effect on suspension performance under braking, typically reducing brake jack. Furthermore, the relative rotation between brake disc and brake caliper as the suspension goes through its travel is different from that in single pivot designs. The four linkages in a split pivot design influence how braking torque is transmitted, how the brake caliper moves in relation to the disc and influence the leverage ratio between wheel travel and shock travel. Since these influences may have a different optimum linkage design, the bike's design has to strike a balance. Dave Weagle designed a split pivot which he named "Split Pivot". [[Trek Bicycle Corporation]] also released a version of the split pivot design called "Active Braking Pivot" (ABP) in early 2007. [[Cycles Devinci]] has released a licensed implementation of the "Split Pivot" design which Dave Weagle managed to patent.

===Horst link===

"Horst Link" suspension is a type of [[four-bar linkage]] suspension. It is characterized by having both connecting links pivot on the seat tube, with the lower pivot located above the center of the bottom bracket, and the rear axle being located higher than the pivot connecting floating link and lower connecting link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leitner|first=Horst|title=Rear suspension for bicycles US5678837|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5678837.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leitner|first=Horst|title=Rear suspension for bicycles US5509679|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5509679.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Specialized Bicycle Components|Specialized]] has bought several of Leitner's patents which they use for their "FSR Suspension". Several manufacturer had licensed the design from Specialized. Some European manufacturers, such as [[Cube (company)|Cube]] and [[SCOTT Sports|Scott]], do use the same suspension design, but couldn't import it to the United States until 2013 due to patent protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Scott USA Genius| accessdate= 21 February 2013| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090220181840/http://bikemag.com/news/newsarchive/012406_scott/| archivedate= 20 February 2009| url= http://bikemag.com/news/newsarchive/012406_scott/?| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norco Bicycles|Norco]], Canadian bicycle manufacturer also licensed the design from Specialized but further optimized the FSR system, calling their own system Advanced Ride Technology (ART).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EXPLAINING ADVANCED RIDE TECHNOLOGY – A.R.T. |url=http://www.norco.com/news/1900/explaining-advanced-ride-technology-a-r-t/ |website=Norco Bicycles |accessdate=14 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221745/http://www.norco.com/news/1900/explaining-advanced-ride-technology-a-r-t/ |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bike Test: Norco Range 2|url=http://www.bikemag.com/gear/bike-test-norco-range-2/|website=Bike Magazine|publisher=The Enthusiast Network|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short link four-bar===
Although not necessarily sharing any general suspension characteristics, these designs all share a certain structural benefit. Because the connecting links are so short, the floating link comes in the form of a rigid rear triangle big enough to encompass the rear wheel. This allows the rear triangle on both sides of the wheel to be rigidly connected together as one piece, before attaching to the connecting links of the four-bar. This significantly increases lateral and torsional stiffness of the rear, often a weakness of four-bar designs, and reduces the load on the pivots, connecting links and joint between rear axle and frame.

====Virtual Pivot Point====
[[File:Santa Cruz 2013 Tallboy Al 09.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|VPP suspension on a 2013 Santa Cruz Tallboy]]
The "Virtual Pivot Point" or VPP, is the name given to a four-bar linkage suspension with relatively short links connecting the rear triangle to the frame. It is characterized by having a chainstay lengthening effect and an 'S' shaped axle path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent RE39159 - Bicycle wheel travel path for selectively applying chainstay lengthening effect|url=http://www.google.com/patents/USRE39159.pdf|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some variations may have the links rotate in opposite direction as the suspension moves. The [[instant centre of rotation]], as found in all linkage systems, is also called virtual pivot point. The "Virtual Pivot Point" suspension was developed by [[Jamie Calon]] and James Klassen for Outland Bikes in the nineties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Paul 'Supersonic' |last=Hayes|first2=Simon |last2=Young|author3=Doddy|title=Buyer's guide to mountain bike suspension, part 2|url=http://www.bikeradar.com/gear/article/buyers-guide-to-mountain-bike-suspension-part-2-28438/|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the associated patents are now owned by [[Santa Cruz Bicycles]].

====DW-link====
[[File:IHsunday.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Diagram of the DW-link suspension, as implemented on an Iron Horse Sunday, showing the location of the instant center at top-out]]
{{Main article|DW-link}}
Dave Weagle's "DW-link" is another four-bar suspension system with two relatively short links, which typically co-rotate. It is characterized by an anti-squat response that varies with suspension travel and is designed to reduce loss of energy resulting from squat during pedaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weagle|first=David|title=Vehicle suspension systems US7128329|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US7128329.pdf|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically has higher anti-squat at the beginning of suspension travel, and less thereafter. The DW-link was originally used by Iron Horse Bicycle Company. The company filed for bankruptcy in early 2009 and was acquired by Dorel Industries in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Dorel Discusses Iron Horse Purchase
| accessdate = 10 November 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The DW-link is now licensed to [[Ibis (bicycles)|Ibis]], [[Independent Fabrication]], [[Turner Suspension Bicycles]], and Pivot Cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dw-link.com/| title = dw-Link| accessdate = 15 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090305233313/http://www.dw-link.com/| archivedate= 5 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Giant Maestro====
Another variation using short, co-rotating, links is employed by [[Giant Bicycles]] called "Maestro". Dave Weagle sued Giant for patent infringement after Giant consulted with Dave Weagle of DW Link. In 2014 the lawsuit was dropped after a lengthy and costly battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vitalmtb.com/news/news/Dave-Weagle-Drops-Patent-Lawsuit-Versus-Giant-Bicycles,782|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201222912/http://www.vitalmtb.com/news/news/Dave-Weagle-Drops-Patent-Lawsuit-Versus-Giant-Bicycles%2C782|archivedate=1 February 2016|title=Dave Weagle Ends Patent Lawsuit Versus Giant Bicycles|date=1 July 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switch link====
Yet another variation of short link design is the "Switch link", found on some [[Yeti Cycles|Yeti]] bikes like the SB-66 designed by Dave Earle. In the original form, the rear triangle is connected to the frame using an [[eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] lower pivot, effectively creating a very short lower link whose length is that from the centre of the eccentric to the attached pivot. The lower link would initially rotate upwards and backwards slightly. The links counter-rotated such that the top link would rotate forwards and upwards initially. As the top link rotated further it would move downwards reversing or "Switching" the lower link's direction downwards and forwards.  In the more recent form, the lower link has been replaced with a linear bearing based on shock technology from Fox Racing Shox. This linear bearing simply moves up initially and then down towards the end of the suspension travel.

====Trek Full Floater====
Trek bicycles' "Full Floater" is a system where the rear shock is only attached to the rear triangle. The chainstays pivot on the seat-tube, and then extend into the front triangle, and the lower shock bushing attaches to the chainstays. The seatstays are attached to an "Evo" link, which then attaches to the shock top bushings. This system enables finer tuning of suspension kinematics, as the shock angle relative to the linkages during the travel changes in a more linear fashion. Trek also combines "Full Floater" with its "ABP" rear axle, where the rear suspension pivot is the rear axle, which reduces pedal feedback and prevents the braking forces on the wheel from altering the suspension movement. It also  provides better traction and control through braking over rough terrain.

===Equilink===
The "Equilink" suspension system was developed by Felt Bicycles for their full suspension line. The system employs a "Stephenson-style" [[six-bar linkage]] suspension system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/tech/2006/shows/interbike06/?id=results/interbike064| title = Felt Equilink design offers another viable rear suspension alternative| last = Huang| first = James| date = September 25–29, 2006| accessdate = 23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equilink gets its name from the dog bone shaped bar that ties the upper and lower links together. Early models included a pivot between chain- and seatstay whereas in later, carbon fiber, models the chain- and seatstays are one piece, creating pivoting action by flexing. Felt contends that the system holds its pedaling efficiency in any gear combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Felt Bicycles |title=Equilink™ Suspension Platform |url=http://www.feltbicycles.com/assest_img/technology_docs/suspension/suspension_12_v1.pdf |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210093316/http://www.feltbicycles.com/assest_img/technology_docs/suspension/suspension_12_v1.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Floating drivetrain==
Bikes with a 'floating drivetrain' or 'floating bottom bracket' can use any type of suspension system to suspend the rear wheel from the frame, but use linkages to connect the crank assembly to the frame and rear suspension. Since the linkages are connected to the rear suspension, suspension movement causes the crank assembly to move as well. The floating drivetrain is often employed to compensate for the disadvantages of a particular rear suspension system so the design can make better use of its advantages.

===Independent Drivetrain===
The "Independent Drivetrain" (or "IDrive"{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}) is a four-bar suspension system for bicycle crank assemblies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Busby|first=James S.|title=Bicycle with crank assembly suspension system US6073950|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6073950.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Busby|first=James S.|title=Bicycle with crank assembly suspension system US6099010|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6099010.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rear wheel itself is suspended as single pivot suspension. It was developed by mountain bike suspension designer Jim Busby Jr. and was a direct result of the limitations encountered with the GT LTS ([[GT Bicycles|GT Bicycles']] "Links Tuned Suspension") four-bar linkage design used by GT Bicycles from 1993 to 1998. The IDrive attempts to maximize the efficiency of the transmission of energy from the rider to the rear wheel. The bottom bracket is placed eccentric in a bearing within the swingarm, the distance between the center of the bearing and the bottom bracket effectively creating a very short link, and the swingarm itself creating another. A link between bearing shell and frame then completes the four-bar linkage with the bottom bracket on the floating link and the linkage as a whole actuated by movement of the swingarm.

===Monolink===
The "Monolink" made by Maverick Bikes and designed by [[RockShox]] founder Paul Turner, is a variant of the Independent Drivetrain suspension, and is a variation of the [[MacPherson strut]]. It uses three pivot points and the sliding action of the shock to provide the fourth degree of freedom. This design places the bottom bracket on the link (the Monolink) connecting the frame and rear triangle. Any load on the cranks is partly unsprung since it is also a load on one of the suspension's parts itself, and actively works against the suspension. However, because of this there is less bob during out-of-the-saddle sprints. Once again it is an attempt at maximizing drivetrain efficiency, compromising other areas. Notable bikes using this design are the Maverick ML7, Durance, ML8 and the Klein Palomino.

===Pendbox===
The "Pendbox" is found on several of [[Lapierre bikes|Lapierre's]] linkage driven single pivot bikes in which the crank assembly is hung from the frame using a 'mini-swingarm'; the Pendbox. A link connects the swingarm and Pendbox such that they form a four-bar linkage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Mike|title=Lapierre DH-720 - Tested|url=http://www.pinkbike.com/news/Lapierre-DH-720-2011-Tested.html|work=Pinkbike.com|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seat suspension==
[[File:Gefederte-sattelstuetze.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|A [[Brooks England|Brooks]] leather [[Bicycle saddle#Suspension|suspension saddle]] mounted on a [[Seatpost#Suspension|suspension seatpost]].]]

Suspension may be implemented at the saddle either using a [[Bicycle saddle#Suspension|suspension saddle]] or a [[Seatpost#Suspension|suspension seatpost]].

The effectiveness of saddle or seatpost suspension depends on the rider placing their weight on the saddle. For this reason, this style of suspension is most popular on more upright styles of bicycle, where the rider spends the majority of time seated.

==Suspension hub==
Suspension may be provided in the hub of a bicycle wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In mountain biking the term 'suspension hub' was used in the 90s to describe hubs with oversized axle ends and a thicker axles than were customary at the time. These hubs were designed to stiffen up suspension forks, which were still somewhat of a novelty, by rigidly holding the fork legs in position relative to each other once the wheel was fitted, improving steering response in the fork. This term is no longer used as this function is no longer an exceptional requirement for mountain bike front hubs, so all current mountain bike hubs are suspension hubs.

==Terminology==
Several terms are commonly used to describe different aspects of a bicycle suspension.

===Travel===
'''Travel''' refers to how much movement a suspension mechanism allows. It usually measures how much the wheel axle moves.

===Preload===
'''Preload''' refers to the force applied to spring component before external loads, such as rider weight, are applied. More preload makes the suspension sag less and less preload makes the suspension sag more.  Adjusting preload affects the ride height of the suspension.

===Rebound===
'''Rebound''' refers to the rate at which the suspension component returns to its original configuration after absorbing a shock. The term also generally refers to '''rebound damping''' or rebound damping adjustments on shocks, which vary the rebound speed. More rebound damping will cause the shock to return at a slower rate.

===Sag===
'''Sag''' refers to how much a suspension moves under just the static load of the rider. Sag is often used as one parameter when tuning a suspension for a rider. Spring preload is adjusted until the desired amount of sag is measured.

===Lockout===
'''Lockout''' refers to a mechanism to disable a suspension mechanism to render it substantially rigid. This may be desirable during climbing or sprinting to prevent the suspension from absorbing power applied by the rider. Some lockout mechanisms also feature a "blow off" system that deactivates the lockout when an appropriate force is applied to help prevent damage to the shock and rider injury under high unexpected loads.

===Bob and squat===
'''Bob''' and '''squat''' refer to how a suspension, usually rear, responds to rider pedalling. Squat usually refers to how the rear end sinks under acceleration, and bob refers to repeated squat and rebound with each pedal stroke. Both are undesirable characteristics as they rob power from pedalling. Many suspension systems incorporate anti-bob, anti-squat, or "platform" damping to help eliminate bob.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Phillips| first = Matt|date=April 2009| title = You Don't Know Squat| journal = Mountain Bike| pages = 39–45| publisher = Rodale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedal feedback===
'''Pedal feedback''' describes torque applied to the [[crankset]] by the [[bicycle chain|chain]] caused by motion of the rear axle relative to the [[bottom bracket]].&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt; Pedal feedback is caused by an increase in the distance between the chainring and rear cog, and it can be felt as a torque on the crankset opposite to forward pedalling.

===Compression damping===
'''Compression damping''' refers to systems that slow the rate of compression in a front fork shock or rear shock. Compression damping is usually accomplished by forcing a hydraulic fluid (such as oil) through a valve when the shock becomes loaded. The amount of damping is determined by the resistance through the valve, a higher amount of damping resulting from greater resistance in the valve. Many shocks have compression damping adjustments which vary the resistance in the valve. Often, lockouts function by allowing no or very little compression.

===Unsprung mass===
{{main article|Unsprung mass}}
'''Unsprung mass''' is the mass of the portions of bicycles that is not supported by the suspension systems.  At one extreme are road bicycles with no suspension in the frames, very little in the [[Bicycle tire|tires]], and none in the saddles.  By raising themselves off their saddles, riders may provide suspension with their knees, making their mass be '''sprung mass''', but all of the mass of the bicycles remains '''unsprung mass'''.  At the other extreme are full suspension mountain bikes.  With front and rear suspensions the only parts unsuspended are the wheels and small parts of the front forks and rear chain-stays.  Even then, as mountain bikes have large low-pressure tires which allow much more [[Bicycle suspension#Travel|travel]] than small high-pressure road tires, the wheels are sprung to some extent as well.

In general, bikes are so light compared to their riders that travel is a much bigger motivator than unsprung mass in determining where to put the suspension and how much to use.  The exception to this is that on recumbent and tandem bicycles where the riders are either unable to lift themselves out of their seat or unable to see in advance when that will be needed, the riders' mass can no longer be expected to be supported by their knees over road irregularities.  These bicycles generally have some sort of suspension system to reduce unsprung mass.

==Mountain bikes==
[[File:Mountain Bike Suspension.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Rear suspension of a Trek Fuel 90, a low single pivot with rocker linkage design.]]
Many newer [[mountain bike]]s have a full suspension design. In the past, mountain bikes had a rigid frame and a rigid fork. In the early 1990s, mountain bikes started to have front suspension forks. This made riding on rough terrain easier on a rider's arms. The first suspension forks had about 1½ to 2&amp;nbsp;inches (38 to 50&amp;nbsp;mm) of suspension travel. Soon after, some frame designers came out with a full suspension frame which gave riders a smoother ride throughout the ride.

Newer suspension frame and fork designs have reduced weight, increased amount of suspension '''travel''', and improved feel. Many lock out the rear suspension while the rider is pedaling hard or climbing, in order to improve pedaling efficiency. Most suspension frames and forks have about 4-6&amp;nbsp;inches (100–150&amp;nbsp;mm) of suspension travel. More aggressive suspension frames and forks made for downhill racing and freeriding have as much as 8 or 9&amp;nbsp;inches (200 or 230&amp;nbsp;mm) of suspension travel.

Many riders still prefer to ride a '''hardtail''' frame, and almost all mountain bicycle riders use a suspension fork. Notable suspension fork manufacturers include [[Manitou]], [[Öhlins]], [[Marzocchi]], [[Fox Racing Shox]], [[RockShox]], and (to a lesser extent) [[X-Fusion]], [[Rapid Suspension Technology|RST]], [[Suntour]] and [[Magura GmbH|Magura]].  Some bicycle manufacturers (notably [[Cannondale Bicycle Corporation|Cannondale]] and [[Specialized Bicycle Components|Specialized]]) also make their own suspension systems to fully complement and integrate the bike set-up.

==Road bikes==
Although much less common, some [[road bicycle]]s do incorporate suspensions, particularly the [[#Soft tail|Soft Tail]] variety mentioned above. One example is [[Trek Bicycle Corporation]]'s s.p.a (Suspension Performance Advantage) rear suspension, offered on some of their Pilot models, but the system was removed for the 2008 model year.
Virtually all bicycles produced by [[Moulton Bicycle|Alex Moulton bicycles]] also have very effective full suspension, due to the low unsuspended mass of the small wheels and high pressure tires, a characteristic of the unconventional design of these bicycles. A recent design is the cantilevered 'swing shock'&lt;ref name="srsuntour-cycling.com"/&gt; on some modern hybrid bikes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bhbikes.com/web/en/outlet/outlet/easy-motion-trekking/mega.html{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recumbent bikes==
[[File:Stinger.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The Optima Stinger recumbent with rear suspension]]
Many [[recumbent bicycle]]s have at least a rear suspension because the rider is usually unable to lift themselves off  the seat while riding. Single pivot is usually adequate when the pedaling thrust is horizontal - that is, forwards rather than downwards. This is usually the case provided the bottom bracket is higher than the seat's base height. Where the bottom bracket is significantly lower than the seat base, there may still be some pedalling-induced bounce.

Short-wheelbase recumbents benefit from front suspension more than long wheelbase recumbents because the front wheel (often small diameter which further magnifies the need for suspension) is taking a much larger portion of the loads than in a long wheelbase recumbent.

==Softride and Zipp==
The [[Softride]] Suspension System was launched at the Interbike 1989 bike show. The original SRS systems consisted of two foam filled fiberglass boxes bonded together with a viscoelastic layer. Originally intended for the use in [[mountain bike]]s, Softride produced its first full-fledged mountain bike, the PowerCurve, in 1991. During 1996 Softride released its first aluminum frame [[Road bicycle|road bike]], the Classic TT. The Softride Suspension System is used almost exclusively for [[Triathlon|triathlon racing]]. Softride ceased bicycle production in 2007 after the design was banned from UCI races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softride.com/about_softride.asp |title=ABOUT SOFTRIDE |accessdate=2007-01-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101020935/http://www.softride.com/about_softride.asp |archivedate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very closely related suspension design to the Softride is the [[Zipp 2001]], a contemporary competing beam bicycle, where the suspension was in the hinge, rather than in flex of the beam itself.

==History==

The earliest cricketing history which can be substantiated relates to a paragraph contained in the publication “The White Tide” by David Sinclair, Modern Press, Gweru 2000 wherein it is recorded that a cricket match was played in the late 1870s in a village named Shoshong between “Home-Born” and the “Colonials”. The game was started in the main by expatriates from Britain, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Sri-Lanka who were on various assignments in the country soon after independence in September 1966. The game was initially played in the two main centres viz Gaborone and [[Francistown]]. However, with the discovery of diamonds on the 1st March 1967 at [[Orapa]]. The Botswana Cricket Association was founded on the 8th February 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cricketbotswana.org/about-bca/cricket-and-botswana/|title=Botswana Cricket History|access-date = 11 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===
The construction of Camp Nou started on 28 March 1954 as Barcelona's previous stadium, [[Camp de Les Corts]], had no room for expansion. Although originally planned to be called the Estadi del FC Barcelona, the more popular name Camp Nou was used. The June 1950 signing of [[László Kubala]], regarded as one of Barcelona's greatest players, provided further impetus to the construction of a larger stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Farred, Grant p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eaude, Michael p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fcbarcelona6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.es/club/noticias/2015-2016/24-de-septiembre-de-1957-inauguracion-del-camp-nou |title=Brief history of Camp Nou |publisher=FC Barcelona |date= |accessdate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architects were Francesc Mitjans and Josep Soteras, with the collaboration of Lorenzo García-Barbón.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camp Nou|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/facilites-and-services/camp_nou|work=FC Barcelona|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early years and the 1982 World Cup ===
In May 1972, Camp Nou hosted its first [[1971–72 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] final between [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]. Rangers won the match with a score of 3–2. The 1970s marked a turning point for Barcelona with the signing of a new player, [[Johan Cruyff]], in 1973. Electronic scoreboards were installed in the stadium two years later.

The stadium underwent an expansion in 1980, in anticipation of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], which added boxes, VIP lounges, a new press area, new markers and the construction of the third tier, which was smaller in height than the original design by 6 metres (46.60 metres compared to the original design of 52.50 metres). The expansion of the stadium added 22,150 new seats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca-paginas.mundodeportivo.com/EMD01/HEM/1980/03/05/MD19800305-006.pdf|title=L'assamblea ha dit sí a l'ampliació de l'estadi |publisher=Mundo Deportivo |date= |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking the total seating capacity to 71,731, and the standing capacity was expanded by 16,500 to 49,670, taking the total stadium capacity (seated and standing combined) to 121,401.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://informesdelaconstruccion.revistas.csic.es/index.php/informesdelaconstruccion/issue/view/225|title=Ampliación del estadio Nou Camp/Barcelona |publisher=(Instituto de Ciencial de la Construcción (CSIC)) |date= |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; FC Barcelona's record attendance was set on 5 March 1986 in the European Cup quarter-final against Juventus in front of 120,000 spectators, just 1,401 shy of the stadium's capacity.

Camp Nou was one of several stadiums used throughout the 1982 World Cup, hosting the inauguration ceremony on 13 June. It also hosted more matches in that tournament than any of the 16 other stadiums used all over Spain, including the opening match, where the traditional opening ceremonies took place (including the releasing of a dove). In front of 95,000, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] upset the defending champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 1–0 in that opening match. It then hosted three round-robin matches between the Soviet Union, Poland, and Belgium, which Poland ended up winning and qualifying from to reach the semi-finals, where they played Italy at the Camp Nou, losing 2–0; Italy went on to win the final match, which was played at Real Madrid's [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]] in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/matches/match=749/report.html |title=1982 FIFA World Cup Spain |publisher=FIFA |date= |accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
The stadium's capacity has varied greatly over the years, opening at 106,146, but growing to 121,401 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.

Apart from hosting Barcelona, Camp Nou is home to the [[Catalan national football team|Catalan team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1235784/No-homage-Catalonia-Arsene-Wenger-Johan-Cruyff-picks-Cesc-Fabregas-Christmas-charity-friendly.html |title=No homage to Catalonia from Arsene Wenger as Johan Cruyff picks Cesc Fabregas for Christmas charity friendly |work=Daily Mail |date= 15 December 2009|accessdate=18 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]] was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brewin |first=John |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=642209&amp;cc=5739 |title=Warnings from history for Manchester United |publisher=ESPN |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the [[Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080528011647/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1992/1992s2.pdf 1992 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. pp. 211–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder,EL Hadii Director of the stadium John. pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp Nou underwent little change after 1982, except for the opening of the [[FC Barcelona museum|club museum]] in 1984. The stadium underwent a facelift in 1993–94, in which the pitch was lowered by 2.5&amp;nbsp;metres (8&amp;nbsp;feet), the security gap that separated the lawn from the galleries was removed, and standing room was eliminated in favor of individual seating. A new press box, renovation of the presidential grandstand and boxes, new parking under the main grandstand, and new lighting and sound systems were completed in time for the 1998–99 season. In 1999, UEFA outlawed standing sections in stadiums, and Camp Nou's capacity settled to its current level.&lt;ref name="info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/club/club_avui/informacio_corporativa/barca_enxifres/barca_enxifres.html |title=Information |publisher=[[FC Barcelona]] |accessdate=16 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526223111/http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/club/club_avui/informacio_corporativa/barca_enxifres/barca_enxifres.html |archivedate=26 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium hosted the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final]] later that year where [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] played [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. United won 2–1, coming back from 0–1 down in [[injury time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/353842.stm|title=United crowned kings of Europe|date=26 May 1999|accessdate=19 August 2010|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1998–99, UEFA rated Camp Nou a five-star stadium for its services and functionalities.&lt;ref name="A five star stadium"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/facilities/card/camp-nou-a-five-star-stadium|title=A five star stadium|publisher=FC Barcelona|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as per the [[UEFA stadium categories|2010 regulations]], UEFA does not publish a list of the top venues.

In 2000, fans were polled concerning the stadium's name. Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a total of 19,861 (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou to Estadi del FC Barcelona, and thus the official name was changed to the popular nickname.&lt;ref name="A one star stadium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbajsalona.com/web/english/club/club_avui/territori_barca/CampNou/estadi_cinc_estrelles.html |title=A five star stadium |publisher=FC Bajsalona |accessdate=13 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710235748/http://www.fcbajsalona.com/web/english/club/club_avui/territori_barca/CampNou/estadi_cinc_estrelles.html |archivedate=10 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facilities now include a memorabilia shop, mini-pitches for training matches, and a chapel for the players. The stadium also houses the second-most visited museum in Catalonia, FC Barcelona Museum, which receives more than 1.2 million visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/CulturaDepartament/Cultura/Temes/Museus/Area%20de%20Difusio%20i%20Explotacio/Estad%C3%ADstiques%20de%20museus/2008/2008.%20Visites%20(per%20ordre%20de%20nom%20del%20museu).pdf|publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya|title=Visites per ordre de nom del museu|accessdate=14 August 2010|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2017, Barcelona's league match against [[UD Las Palmas|Las Palmas]] was played in an empty Camp Nou due to [[2017 Spanish constitutional crisis|political turmoil in the region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Ben|title=Lionel Messi helps Barcelona extend perfect start at empty Camp Nou|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/01/barcelona-las-palmas-empty-camp-nou-real-madrid-espanyol|accessdate=2 October 2017|work=The Guardian|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renovation and expansion ==
The club issued an international tender to remodel the stadium as a celebration of the stadium's fiftieth anniversary. The objective was to make the facility an integrated and highly visible urban environment. The club schemed to increase the [[seating capacity]] by 13,500, with at least half of the total seating to be under cover. The intention was to make it the third-largest stadium in the world (in terms of seating capacity), after the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] in the USA (297,000 capacity), and the [[Rungnado May Day Stadium]] in North Korea (114,000 capacity).

On 18 September 2007, the British architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and his company were selected to "restructure" Camp Nou. With an estimated cost of €250 million, the plan included the addition of roughly 6,000 seats for a maximum capacity of 105,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/1552/default.aspx| title=Camp Nou| publisher=Fosters + Partners| accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FC Barcelona board approved the sale of their former training ground (the [[Mini Estadi]]) against significant opposition in order to finance the remodeling. The project was planned to begin in 2009 and to be finished for the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Paul Hamilos| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/24/football.architecture| title=European football: Foster to give Camp Nou Gaudí-inspired facelift| publisher=The Guardian| date=24 September 2007| accessdate=16 August 2010| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the 2008 financial crisis, the sale of the training ground was postponed and likewise the remodeling project. In May 2010, [[Sandro Rosell]], then a candidate for president of FC Barcelona, dismissed the possibility of selling the Mini Estadi, saying it would be indefensible to "sell the crown jewels", and his election on 30 June 2010 effectively halted the plan to remodel Camp Nou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/deportes/noticias/20100520/53931312016/rosell-veria-como-una-muy-mala-noticia-vender-los-terrenos-del-miniestadi.html| title=Rosell vería como una "muy mala noticia" vender los terrenos del Miniestadi| language=Spanish| publisher=La Vanguardia| date=20 May 2010| accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elmundodeportivo.es/gen/20100701/53956573877/noticia/laporta-un-elefant-en-el-palco.html| title=Laporta, un 'elefant' en el palco| publisher=El Mundo Deportivo| date=15 July 2010| language=Spanish| accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Barcelona's board of directors rejected the option of building a new stadium due to financial constraints and instead opted to remodel the Camp Nou to bring the capacity up to 105,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25819769|title=Barcelona announce Nou Camp redevelopment plan|date=20 January 2014|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is expected to run from 2017 to early 2021, with a cost of around £495 million (€600 million), making it one of the most expensive expansions on a per-seat basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2542900/The-New-Camp-Barcelona-reveal-495m-plan-develop-105-000-capacity-stadium-roof.html|title=The New Camp!

Camp Nou has been used for various purposes other than football, often hosting major concerts. Pope [[John Paul II]] celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] for a congregation of over 121,500 at Camp Nou on 17 November 1982, on the occasion being made an honorary citizen of Barcelona.&lt;ref name=pope&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/818978971.html?dids=818978971:818978971&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+08%2C+2005&amp;author=Cathal+Kelly&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Pope%27s+team%3F+Myths+never+had+a+prayer&amp;pqatl=google |title=Pope's team?

In 1983, [[Julio Iglesias]] played for 60,000 people, in what was described as a "most beautifully orchestrated" concert.&lt;ref&gt;García, Elizabeth p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Other high-profile performances at Camp Nou include those by [[Bruce Springsteen]] on 3 August 1988 during his [[Tunnel of Love Express Tour]]; and again on 19 and 20 July 2008 during his [[Magic Tour (Bruce Springsteen)|Magic Tour]]. On 9 August 1988, [[Michael Jackson]] appeared at the stadium in front of 95,000 fans during his [[Bad World Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trekiz.com/standardtour-9771-20411/Camp-Nou-Experience-%28FC-Barcelona%29.html|title=Camp Nou Experience (FC Barcelona) – Trekiz|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 1988, a charity concert organised by [[Amnesty International]] to support human rights featured, among others, Bruce Springsteen, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Tracy Chapman]], and [[El Último de la Fila]]. A concert by the [[Three Tenors]] – Josep Carreras, Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti – was held on 13 July 1997. On 3 August 1988 Bruce Springsteen appeared in front of 90,000 people on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour. He came back on 3 September 1988 to appear in front of again 90,000 on the [[Human Rights Now!]] tour.

[[U2]] performed at the stadium three times: the first one was on 7 August 2005 during their [[Vertigo Tour]], in front of a sold out crowd of 81,269 people. The second and the third were on 30 June and 2 July 2009 during their [[U2 360° Tour]], in front of a total crowd of 182,055 people. The encore performance of "[[I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight]]" from the second 2009 show was filmed for the music video of the single.

On 4 November 2014, [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]] (LNR), which operates France's professional rugby union leagues, announced that the [[2015–16 Top 14 season|2015–16]] [[Top 14]] final would be held at the Camp Nou on 24 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.lnr.fr/top-14-le-point-la-finale-2016-du-top-14-au-camp-nou-a-barcelone-04-11-2014-2-17-19269,19269.html |title=La Finale 2016 du TOP 14 au Camp Nou, à Barcelone ! |publisher=Ligue nationale de rugby |language=French |date=4 November 2014 |accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Top 14 final is traditionally held at the [[Stade de France]] in the [[Paris]] suburb of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]]. However, the scheduling of the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] caused the 2015–16 French season to be shifted by several weeks, in turn causing the Stade de France to be unavailable because it would be a major venue for [[UEFA Euro 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/national-rugby-championship/rugby/story/246645.html |title=Barcelona confirmed as host of 2016 Top 14 final |publisher=ESPN Scrum |date=4 November 2014 |accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match ultimately drew a crowd of 99,124, setting a new record for attendance at a domestic rugby match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Rugby/Actualites/En-battant-toulon-le-racing-92-est-sacre-champion-de-france/698977 |title=En battant Toulon, le Racing 92 est sacré champion de France |first=Romain |last=Bergogne |newspaper=[[L'Équipe]] |language=French |date=24 June 2016 |accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tramway ===
Approximately 680 metres from Camp Nou there is the [[Trambaix]] Avinguda de Xile station (lines T1, T2 and T3).

=== Metro ===
[[File:Barcelona Metro Logo.svg|right|150px]]
The stadium is accessible from the [[Barcelona Metro]] with the closest stations to Camp Nou are [[Palau Reial (Barcelona Metro)|Palau Reial]], [[Maria Cristina (Barcelona Metro)|Maria Cristina]] and [[Les Corts (Barcelona Metro)|Les Corts]], on [[Barcelona Metro line 3|L3]]; [[Badal (Barcelona Metro)|Badal]] on [[Barcelona Metro line 5|L5]] and [[Collblanc (Barcelona Metro)|Collblanc]] on L5 or [[Barcelona Metro line 9|L9]] 
[[Zona Universitària (Barcelona Metro line 9|L9]]. All are 500 to 1,000 metres from Camp Nou, depending on which of the gates (accesses) to Camp Nou are used. Usually metro services are increased when there is a match with significant passenger congestion nonetheless.

Closest station to each access:
* Accesses 1–10: Palau Reial.
* Accesses 11–16: Collblanc.
* Accesses 17 and 18: Badal.
* Accesses 19–21: les Corts.

Currently a station for [[Avinguda de Xile / Camp Nou (Barcelona Metro)|Camp Nou]] is under construction, on L9 and [[Barcelona Metro line 10|L10]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Critical reception==
The movie opened to generally mediocre reviews, with just 33% of critics followed by [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving it a favorable review. ''[[USA Today]]'' said that it "has moments of sweetness, but not enough poignancy or wit to turn it into the endearing art-house comedy that it aspires to be." ''[[Time Out New York]]'' said, "Great, just what we needed: another rote exercise in indie-feely humanism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/diminished_capacity/ ''Diminished Capacity'' Movie Reviews, Pictures], [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''face shield''' is a device used to protect wearer's entire [[face]] (or part of it) from impact [[hazard]] such as flying objects and [[road debris]], chemical splashes (in industry), or potentially infectious fluid (in medical).

==Industry==
Face shield, a protective device commonly intended to shield the wearer's face, or portions thereof, in addition to the eyes, from certain hazards, depending on faceshield type. Faceshields shall be used only in conjunction with spectacles and/or goggles.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI  Z87.1-2003, page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard===
;[[ANSI]] (American Standard)
* Mark Z87: Basic impact: Faceshields shall be capable of resisting impact from a 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm (1&amp;nbsp;in) diameter steel ball dropped from a height of 127&amp;nbsp;cm (50&amp;nbsp;in).
* Mark Z87+: High impact: Faceshields shall be capable of resisting impact from a 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm (0.25&amp;nbsp;in) diameter steel ball traveling at a velocity of 91.4&amp;nbsp;m/s (300&amp;nbsp;ft/s).
** ref. ANSI Z87.1

;[[EN 166]] (European Standard)
These are for protection against high-speed particles, and must withstand the impact of a 6&amp;nbsp;mm nominal diameter steel ball, striking the oculars and the lateral protection at the speed stated.
* Mark A: 190&amp;nbsp;m/s.
* Mark B: 120&amp;nbsp;m/s.
* Mark F: 45&amp;nbsp;m/s.
** ref. EN166

See also [[welding helmet]].

===Material===
*;[[Polycarbonate]] (PC)
Provide excellent impact resistance, optical quality, heat resistance and normal chemical resistance.

*;[[Cellulose acetate]] (CA)
Provide normal impact resistance, optical quality, heat resistance and good chemical resistance.

==Manufacturing==
There are two methods to manufacture faceshields, [[extrusion]] and [[injection molding]]. Faceshields cut from extrusion sheets provide better impact resistance than injection molding faceshields because extrusion sheets are made of high molecular weight plastic pellets while injection molding must use lower molecular weight plastic pellets, which provide better melt flowing property needed by injection molding. For example, even 0.8&amp;nbsp;mm thickness faceshields made of extrusion polycarbonate sheets can withstand the impact of a 6&amp;nbsp;mm nominal diameter steel ball traveling at the speed 120&amp;nbsp;m/s (European standard, protection against high-speed particles – medium energy impact), while injection molding faceshields must have at least 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm thickness to withstand the same impact. However, injection molding can provide more complicated shape than extrusion.

==Medical==
[[File:Efficacy of Face Shields Against Cough Aerosol Droplets from a Cough Simulator.webm|thumb|right|A video describing research on the efficacy of face shields to protect against aerosol emitted from coughing.]]
In medical areas, "face shield" refers to a variety of devices used to protect a medical professional during a procedure that might expose the worker to blood or other potentially infectious fluid. An example is the use of a [[CPR mask]] while performing [[rescue breathing]] or [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]]. Another example is the use of [[Infection control#Personal Protective Equipment .28PPE.29|personal protective equipment]] to guard the face against splashing, spraying or splattering of blood or other potentially infectious materials.

==Police==
In riot protection, "face shield" often means a transparent [[visor]].

== Construction ==
[[File:US Navy 060127-N-9641C-002 Chief Damage Controlman, John Brooks, removes the face shield from a Sailor^rsquo,s MCU-2-P gas mask.jpg|thumb|260px|alt=text|Atlantic Ocean (Jan. 27, 2006) - Chief Damage Controlman, John Brooks, removes the face shield from a Sailor’s MCU-2/P gas mask after washing it with decontamination solution during a General Quarters Drill aboard the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69). Eisenhower is underway conducting carrier qualifications.]]On many construction sites you will find workers using face shields to protect their eyes and face from flying debris or sparks. Many tools that involve cutting and working with metal recommend the use of a face shield. Examples would be workers that are using [[Welding|welding equipment]] or [[Abrasive saw|metal chop saws]].

The '''Moss Rose''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Macclesfield]], [[Cheshire]], England. It is currently used primarily for [[Association football|football]] matches and is the home ground of [[Macclesfield Town F.C.]]. The stadium holds 6,355&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.footballgroundguide.com/macclesfield_town Football Ground Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and was built in 1891, making it one of the oldest grounds in the Football League.

==History==
The Moss Rose first hosted [[Football League]] action when [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] played home games at the stadium between moving from [[Sealand Road]] to the [[Deva Stadium]] from 1990 to 1992. The first such match was a 2-1 win for [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] on 1 September 1990. Later in the month, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] played at the Moss Rose in a [[Football League Cup]] tie, winning 1-0. Macclesfield were a non-league side at the time and fixtures were arranged so Chester were at home when Macclesfield were away and vice versa. The Moss Rose pitch was having to contend with more than 50 first-team matches a season from the two sides.

Despite hosting [[Football League]] matches in this period, Macclesfield were denied entry to the Football League in 1995 after winning the [[Football Conference]] after the stadium requirements were tightened&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A684380 BBC h2g2 The Football Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; (a reciprocal offer by Chester to allow Macclesfield to play at the [[Deva Stadium]] while the necessary improvements were made was also rejected by the league). Macclesfield were champions again two years later and the Moss Rose was now up to the required standards. The Silkmen beat [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in their first home league match on 9 August 1997 and the Moss Rose continues to host professional matches today.

==Structure and facilities==
[[Image:Alfred McAlpine Stand.png|thumb|200px|left|Alfred McAlpine Stand in 2006.]]
The ground consists of four stands. The Silk FM stand (traditionally known as the London Road or Main stand) runs along one side of the pitch. It is usually given over entirely to home supporters, unless the travelling support is particularly large, in which case the right-hand side of this stand houses some away fans. There is terracing along the entire length of the pitch, with a small stand at the back of the terracing. The Macclesfield Audi Stand (traditionally known as the Star Lane End) is to the left of the Silk FM stand, and is used by the home support. Opposite the Silk FM stand is the Henshaw's Stand (originally known as the McAlpine stand, named after the architects that also designed the ground of [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]). This is all-seated and covered, and houses home supporters, and a small number of travelling fans. At the opposite end to the Macclesfield Audi Stand is the Silkmen Terrace, which is an open terrace and is given to away fans. Unfortunately, as Macclesfield is often struck by wet weather, this can make for an uncomfortable spectating experience for visiting fans. There are plans to introduce some seating at the back of the Silkmen End and build a leisure complex and hotel behind it, but currently the finances required to do this do not exist.

==Future==
{{commons category}}
In August 2007 the club announced initial talks about moving to a purpose built home on the nearby South Macclesfield Development Area. This would see the club moving a little over a mile to the south west of its current location. The plans continued to develop and in September 2010 the local council announced that 65% of people questioned as a part of a public consultation process were behind a new stadium in the South Macclesfield Development Area.

'''The National Sports Campus Development Authority''' (NSCDA) is an Irish [[public body]] responsible for developing and running a National Sports Campus in [[Abbotstown]], [[Blanchardstown]], [[Dublin]]. It was formally established on 1 January, 2007 under the National Sports Campus Development Authority Act 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acts.oireachtas.ie/en.act.2006.0019.1.html |title=Number 19/2006: National Sports Campus Authority Act 2006 |date=5 July 2006 |website=[[Oireachtas]] |access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:I crated this file.jpg|thumb|right|National Sports Campus Map Blanchardstown Oct 2013]] --&gt;
==Functions==
The principal functions of the Authority are to:-&lt;br /&gt;

* Develop a National Sports Campus;
* Manage, operate and maintain the Campus;
* Encourage and promote usage of the Campus.

The Authority has responsibility for the operation of the [[National Aquatic Centre]] which is a key resource within the National Sports Campus at Blanchardstown. Furthermore, since May 2010 NSCDA has accepted responsibility for the management and operation of [[Morton Stadium]], [[Santry]]. It discharges this responsibility through its wholly owned subsidiary NSCDA (Operations) Ltd which is also responsible for the National Aquatic Centre and other facilities at Blanchardstown.

==Achievements==
The Authority has refurbished buildings on the Campus to accommodate the Headquarters of the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI), the Irish Institute of Sport (IIS), and the Irish Sport HQ which accommodates the administrative headquarters of 19 National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of Sport in Ireland. The NSCDA has also allocated substantial sites for development in partnership with the major field sports of Gaelic Games, Soccer, Rugby and Hockey. 

In addition, in October 2013 the NSCDA completed the development of High Performance training facilities for athletes in a variety of sporting disciplines including Equestrianism, Modern Pentathlon, Fencing, Pistol-Shooting,  Gymnastics and Dry Land Diving. The National Horse Sport Arena has been warmly received. The NSCDA is also installing Multi-Sport All-weather Pitches and a Pavilion which will be open to the public by the end of 2013.

In March 2015 [[Fingal County Council]] gave planning permission for an indoor [[velodrome]] to be constructed as part of the National Sports Campus. The planned facility will incorporate a number of badminton courts in the track centre. The track is projected to be completed before the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/shane-stokes-velodrome-project-crucial-to-future-success-of-ireland-s-cyclists-1.2606357 |title=Velodrome project crucial to future success of Ireland’s cyclists |last1=Stokes |first1=Shane|date= |website=[[irishtimes.com]]|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nojima Sagamihara Rise''' are an [[American football]] team located in [[Sagamihara City]], [[Kanagawa]], [[Japan]].  They are a member of the [[X-League]].

Similar to how fellow X-League member [[Elecom Kobe Finies]]'s visual identity is inspired by the [[National Football League]]'s [[Dallas Cowboys]], the Nojima Sagamihara Rise's visual identity is inspired by the [[Denver Broncos]], primarily in respect to its colors (navy blue and orange), logo (A charging horse with a flame-like mane) and uniforms (The Rise's home jersey is navy blue with orange accents - similar to the Broncos' 1997-2011 home jersey/2012-present alternate jersey), though the shade of orange which the Rise uses is closer to red.

==Team History==
*2009 Team founded. First named '''Sagamihara Rise'''. Promoted from X3 to X2 at the end of the year.

'''Palmerston Park''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium on Terregles Street in [[Dumfries]], [[Dumfries and Galloway]], Scotland.  It is the home ground of [[Scottish Championship]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]], who have played there since 1919. [[South of Scotland Football League|South of Scotland League]] club [[Heston Rovers F.C.|Heston Rovers]] have shared Palmerston since 2013. The stadium has a capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|queensouth}}&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/queen-of-the-south/ |title=Queen of the South Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 3,377 are seats.&lt;ref name="nsc"&gt;[http://www.qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=2494 New Stadium Capacity]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Palmerston Park was first opened in 1919, when Queen of the South were formed, although [[association football|football]] had been played on the site since the 1870s. The site of the ground was formerly a farm called Palmers Toun. This is on the [[Maxwelltown]] side of the [[River Nith]] in Dumfries. [[Jimmy McKinnell]], [[Tom Wylie]] and [[Willie McCall (footballer born 1898)|Willie McCall]] were all sold to [[Blackburn Rovers]] around the same time by Queen of the South. This combined with the sale of [[Ian Dickson (footballer)|Ian Dickson]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] helped to fund the purchase of Palmerston Park in 1921 for £1,500.

The Portland Drive Terrace was covered in the late 1950s. Soon afterwards, floodlights were installed and these were first used in a match against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in October 1958. These are the tallest free standing floodlights in Scottish football, standing at 85 feet. The current main stand was constructed in 1965, soon after the original had burned down.

On the east side of the ground "Jimmy Jolly's Bullshed", later known as the "Coo Shed", was originally named after one of the founder members of the club in 1919, when it was built around 1933 as the club reached the first division for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;http://wwwqosarchive.co.uk/10qosaz.html&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced by an all seater stand in 1995 and was named the East Stand. A challenge game was held in April 1995 to commemorate the opening of the new stand and Queens' 75th anniversary against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Guest players for Queens in the 2&amp;ndash;2 draw included [[Davie Irons]], future managers [[Rowan Alexander]] and [[Ian McCall (footballer)|Ian McCall]], [[Ted McMinn]], [[Andy Thomson (Scottish footballer)|Andy Thomson]]. Scenes from the film ''[[A Shot at Glory]]'', starring [[Robert Duvall]], were shot at Palmerston Park during 1999.

The club was relegated to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Scottish Second Division]] in 2012, but carried out some remedial work to the stadium, including new water systems and ticket offices.&lt;ref name = "2012 work"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-19011544|title=Queen of the South Palmerston Park revamp under way|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A redevelopment of the 1960s main stand is planned.&lt;ref name = "2012 work"/&gt; During March 2013, Queen of the South were given approval to install a new 5G artificial pitch at Palmerston Park for the start of the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref name = "2013 pitch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-22316281 |title=Queen of the South fans bid farewell to Palmerston turf |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=27 April 2013 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dgstandard.co.uk/dumfries-news/local-news-dumfries/local-news-dumfriesshire/2013/03/22/palmerston-s-3g-pitch-given-greenlight-51311-33036074/ |title=Palmerston's 3G Pitch given greenlight |first=Sandy |last=Kilpatrick |work=Dumfries &amp; Galloway Standard |publisher=Scottish &amp; Universal Newspapers |date=22 March 2013 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the club's final home game of the 2012&amp;ndash;13 season, the club sold the turf for £10 per square yard as well as auctioning seven special lots.&lt;ref name = "2013 pitch"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "auction"/&gt; These were the four corner plots, the two penalty spots and [[Ryan McCann]]'s 84 yard spot.&lt;ref name = "auction"&gt;[http://www.qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=1740 Palmerston Turf Sale and Auction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and facilities==

Of the {{SPFL-stadiums|queensouth}}&lt;ref name="capacity"/&gt; capacity, there are 3,377 seats.&lt;ref name="nsc"/&gt; Up until the late 1990s the stadium had a capacity of 8,352, but this was reduced when the Terregles Street end terracing was closed. It was given a safety certificate in September 2014, adding standing capacity of 1,968.&lt;ref name="nsc"/&gt;

There are 2,192 seats in the all seated East Stand. For the 2012–13 season this stand was known as the Galloway News Stand, then from 2013–14 until the 2017-18 season this stand was known as the Rosefield Salvage Stand. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.qosfc.com/news-4035 &lt;/ref&gt; For the 2018-19 season, Queens centenary, the stand will be known as the BDS Digital Stand. &lt;ref&gt; 
http://www.qosfc.com/news-4035 &lt;/ref&gt;

Opposite this is the main stand, built in 1965, which now has 1,185 seats. The main stand is a small, classic looking covered stand, where the seating area is raised. There are standing terraces for fans to the left and in front of this stand. Since the 2013–14 season the main stand has been known as the Gates Power Transmission Stand. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.qosfc.com/news-4035 &lt;/ref&gt;

The Portland Drive Terrace, with a capacity of 3,345 &lt;ref name="nsc"/&gt; is a traditional standing area and is now the largest area of covered terracing in Scotland and is reminiscent of all British football grounds prior to the [[Hillsborough disaster]]. The terrace is notable for the clock face mounted in the centre of the roof that used to be an advert for a local hostelry, where Time to Visit The Hole I' The Wa' was written underneath the clock. Since the 2015–16 season the terrace has been known as the Oakbank Services Terrace. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=2873&lt;/ref&gt; 

The grass playing surface was widely recognised for its good condition. [[Iain McChesney]] described the surface as simply a 'Good park'. [[Jocky Dempster]] later said in an interview that among his reasons for signing for Queens was, "I liked the park at Queens. As you know it’s a good park, a good surface."  [[Crawford Boyd]] said, "It was a lovely park, it was a treat to play on that park, a lovely playing surface." Ted McMinn commented, "Palmerston was like a bowling green, you knew when you went to kick the ball you wouldn’t get a bobble."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qosfc.com/legends John Dempster, Crawford Boyd, Iain McChesney and Ted McMinn interviews on Queens Legends on www.qosfc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendances==

Crowds for Queen of the South fixtures are normally around 2,000 people, unless there is a major cup game against higher league opposition. The first league game against local rivals [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]] at the end of August 2006 attracted almost 5,500 spectators, which was the highest league attendance since 2002. There was a full house at Queens' match against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibs]] in the [[2006–07 Scottish Cup]]. Similarly, over 6,000 watched the victory over [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in the [[2007–08 Scottish Cup]].

Modern attendances are small in comparison with Queens' heyday in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. For example, 10,948 watched the team featuring [[Willie Savage]], [[Willie Culbert]] and [[Willie Ferguson]] in Queens first ever game in the top flight of Scottish football in 1933, the 3–2 win against Celtic.&lt;ref name=autogeneratedsavage&gt;[http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx Queen of the South v Celtic, 1933 Scottish League; Queen of the South v Rangers, 1937 Scottish Cup; in the profile on Willie Savage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917025553/http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx |date=17 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 13,000 watched a Queens side managed by [[George McLachlan]] and captained by Savage knock Rangers out of the [[Scottish Cup]] in January 1937.&lt;ref name=autogeneratedsavage /&gt; The highest recorded attendance at Palmerston Park was set on 23 February 1952, when a crowd of 26,552 squeezed very tightly in to see Queens play in a Scottish Cup third round tie against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]].&lt;ref name=autogeneratedoakes/&gt; [[Jackie Oakes]] scored the only Queens goal in a 3–1 defeat.&lt;ref name=autogeneratedoakes&gt;[http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx Queen of the South v Heart of Midlothian , 1952 Scottish Cup; in the profile on Jackie Oakes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917025553/http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx |date=17 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==

[[Dumfries railway station]], which is served by trains on the [[Glasgow South Western Line]], is the closest railway station to Palmerston Park. The walk between the two sites takes between 15 and 20 minutes. The [[A75 road]] bypasses Dumfries; people travelling to Palmerston from the north or east should follow the [[A76 road]] (Glasgow Road) into Dumfries, then the A780 road and Terregles Street lead to Palmerston. Car parking is available in surrounding streets and in the Ice Bowl behind the Rosefield Salvage Stand.

The '''Panama national rugby union team''' represents [[Panama]] in [[rugby union]]. They are nicknamed the "Diablos Rojos" (Red Devils).

==History==

Panama's first international match was in 2005, in Ciudad de Panama, Panama, against the [[Costa Rica national rugby union team]], which they lost 60-0. At this time there were no names to represent the rugby selection of Panama as an official team. This team that played against Costa Rica during this year of 2005 no longer exists.

In December 2006, Panama, represented now by an official rugby club named Diablos Rojos Rugby Club of Panama (D.R.R.C of Panama), played against the Law School Veterans team of Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Madrid, Spain) at Balboa Stadium, located in Ancon, Ciudad de Panama. The result of this game was 14-12 to the Madrid team.

Panama were accepted into, and hosted, the [[2014 South American Rugby Championship "C"|CONSUR Mayor C]] tournament.

'''Ringball'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=South Africa|title=ringball|website=www.ringballsa.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a traditional South African [[team sport|sport]] that stems from [[basketball]] and has been played since 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Suid-Afrikaanse Korfbalraad Gedenkalbum 75 jaar. Health Wealth Publication (Edms.) Bpk. 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.topendsports.com/sport/more/ringball.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The sport is now promoted in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=India|title=Ringball|website=www.ringballindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mauritius]] to establish Ringball as an international sport.  The sport is played by both men and women teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arnoldclassicafrica.com/index.php/sports-events/ringball |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508110842/http://www.arnoldclassicafrica.com/index.php/sports-events/ringball |archivedate=8 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Ringball is a non-contact sport&lt;ref&gt;http://www.topendsports.com/sport/more/ringball.htm&lt;/ref&gt; played by both men and women teams in separate games. It is similar to the game of [[netball]] and can be played on an all weather, grass, or in-door [[#The Court|court]].  The court is divided into three sections. A team consists of three goal scorers, three centre players, and three defending players. The objective of the game is to throw the ball from one player to another and finally through the ring or hoop of the goalpost.  A goalpost is placed at both ends of the court.[[File:Ringball_starting_positions.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.0|Starting positions of players on a Ringball court. The red player in the [[semicircle]] holds the ball.]]

The South African game of ringball is played by two opposing teams consisting of nine (9) players on a side. Three players of each team play in each of the three sections of the court (three (3) goal shooters, three (3) centre players and three (3) defenders).  These players may at no time during play, touch ground in any adjacent section, step on or receive the ball over the lines separating the sections.

The ball is passed through the air from player to player and is caught with the hands, such that the ball does not touch any other part of the body.  In passing the ball, a player may not move forward or backward, feint a pass, or be in possession of the ball for longer than two (2) seconds during the attempt to pass the ball.

To [[Ringball#The Score|score]], the ball must fall through the ring from above.  A goal shooter may attempt to score a goal from any position in the goal section and outside the [[semicircle]].  Both hands (from below upwards) must be used when shooting a goal and must be attempted within five (5) seconds from the time the ball is received.  When a penalty goal has been awarded, any of the three opposing goal shooters can attempt a goal from any position outside the goal circle.  A penalty goal must be attempted within three (3) seconds.  A goal shooter can also attempt a penalty from behind the penalty line within three (3) seconds.

Players may try to gain possession of the ball without hitting or snatching the ball from the opponent's hands.  Players are not allowed to hold, push away or obstruct their opponents in any manner to prevent them from passing the ball.  Two (2) players of the same team may not touch or hold the ball simultaneously.  It is an infringement if the ball crosses the section without being touched by a player in that section.

When players of both teams commit a transgression simultaneously, it is called a double fault.  The referee then tosses the ball into the air between two opposing players where the transgressions occurred.  The two opposing players then attempt to gain possession of the ball by hitting or catching the ball on the descend.

A match consists of two-halves of 25 minutes each with an interval of three (3) minutes.  After each successful goal, the players must take up position as shown on the image.  The centre player stands in the half circle facing his own goalpost.  At the blow of the whistle the ball must be passed to one of the wings within two (2) seconds.  It is an infringement when the ball is passed to another section without passing to a wing first.

When the ball goes out of play crossing the outside lines, an opposing player from that section puts the ball into play on the spot where it has left the court.

The team with the highest score at the end of the match is the winning team.

== Rules ==

===The Court===

1.	The court&lt;ref&gt;Ringball South Africa – Rules of the game, updated April 2016.  Approved AGM 2015&lt;/ref&gt; is 27 m x 18 m in size and is divided into three (3) equal sections (9 m x 18 m).  The two goalposts are situated in the middle of each short side of the court against the outside line.  Each goalpost has a steel ring of 450mm in diameter attached at the top, exactly 3 m from the ground.  With the goalpost as pivot a half circle (the goal circle) with a radius of 4,5 m is drawn.  The penalty line is short line in the goal section 1 m in length and 2 m from the middle inside line directly in line with the middle half circles. The two side sections are called the goal sections and the middle section is called the centre section.  Exactly in the middle of the centre section, a circle of 1 m diameter and in the middle of the two inside lines, two half circles with a diameter of 1 m are drawn.  On either side of the centre circle two "V”-lines with legs of 1 m long are drawn and this is referred to as the "V”. See the diagram below for the position of the goalposts.

[[File:Ringball court layout.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The image indicates the markings on a ringball court for the purpose of discussing the gameplay.]]

2.	All-weather, gravel or grass courts, or adapted netball courts may be used.  The surface of the court must be even.  Gravel courts must be free of grass and must be well compacted.  Slip-free all-weather courts are recommended.  Netball courts can be used with minor adjustments.

3.	Within a distance of 1,5 m around the court there should be no obstacles such as trees, light poles, walls, fences, wires or steps (also see the [[Ringball#Spectators|spectators]] section).

4.	All lines must be clearly marked in white or yellow.  The width of these lines should be between 25&amp;nbsp;mm and 50&amp;nbsp;mm.

5.	The goalposts must be of 3 m circular steel pipes with a diameter of 75 – 90&amp;nbsp;mm.  The goalposts must be placed in a vertical position in the centre of the 18 m outside line.  The inside edge of the goal post must form a tangent with the inside edge of the line.

6.	The ring on the goalpost must be of a sturdy round metal bar with a maximum of 18&amp;nbsp;mm thickness and an inside diameter of 350&amp;nbsp;mm.  Flat steel rings are not allowed.  The ring must be horizontally fixed (level) to the top of the post and should not hop up when the ball bounces on the ring.  The rings should be painted white or silver.

7.	The nets must be large enough to allow a number 5 ball to pass through and must be correctly fixed to the goal ring.  White or yellow nylon nets are recommended.  Balls could be shot out when the nets are affixed too tightly.

===The Ball===

1.	A ball made of leather or synthetic material should be used.  Rubber balls are not permitted (Wet leather balls and balls inflated too hard stretch while underinflated leather balls stretch at the seams).

2.	All teams play with a number 5 ball, with a circumference of between 69 and 71&amp;nbsp;cm and a mass of approximately 450 grams (Balls with loose laces or uneven surfaces are not allowed).

3.	The u/9, u/11 and u/13 teams play with a number 4 ball, with a circumference of 64&amp;nbsp;cm.

===The Players===

1.	A ringball team consists of nine (9) players, viz., three (3) goal shooters, three (3) centre players and three (3) defenders.  Only three (3) players of a team are allowed in each section.

2.	At least eight (8) players of a team must be present at the start of a game.  A player who arrives late, is allowed to join the game only when the ball is out of play and with the permission of the referee.  No team is allowed to play with seven (7) or less players after the game has started with eight (8) or nine (9) players; e.g. in the event of two (2) players of the same team being disqualified during the match.  The team with the disqualified players forfeits the league points and the opposing team wins the match.

3.	No player is allowed to leave the court without the permission of the referee.

4.	A maximum of three (3) players of a team may be substituted at any time during the match.  The substitution player may only join the team when the ball is out of play and with the permission of the referee.

5.	In the event of a sick or injured player who is unable to continue play, a substitute may immediately take up his place.  A disqualified player may not be substituted.

6.	If the injured player only receives treatment and wants to return to continue play, no substitution player may take his position.  Play continues with his team consisting of eight (8) players until he is ready to return to his position to continue play.

7.	In the event of all three (3) substitutes already participating any of the original players may return to the game.  An injured player, if sufficiently recovered, may return at own risk.  No new substitutes may be used.

8.	Injury time of two (2) minutes is allowed on court.  In the event of a serious injury, time must be granted for the player to receive medical treatment on court or to be removed.  Injury time shall be added to the half in question.

9.	A player experiencing any type of a bleeding must leave the court immediately and can be substituted.  As soon as the bleeding has stopped, the player may rejoin the game with the permission of the referee.  In the event of the player not returning within five (5) minutes, the substitute will then complete the game.

===The Referee===

1.	A qualified neutral person should officiate at matches as referee.

2.	The referee shall enforce the rules and his decision is final.  The referee's responsibility comprises, inter alia:
a)	enforcing the rules and regulate the game uniformly.
b)	ensuring that the match progresses orderly and obviating irregularities.
c)	promoting the fluency of the match.
d)	ensuring that the court and the ball are suitable for play.

3.	The referee blows the whistle only:
a)	to start or end the match.
b)	after a goal was scored.
c)	when any infringement of a rule occurs.
d)	when the ball goes out of play.

4.	The referee is ultimately responsible for the time and the score and, after consultation with the scorekeepers concerning the time and score, his decision is final.

5.	The referee must verify the time with the linesman during the match.

6.	The referee must verify the score during the interval.  In the event where all three (referee and two (2) scorekeepers) differ, the referee’s score shall be accepted.  When the scores of the two (2) scorekeepers are the same, their score shall be accepted after consultation.

7.	An appeal against a referee can only be lodged on the grounds of incompetence and/or for any prejudice against and/or favouritism towards a particular team.  Any appeal or objection must be lodged in accordance with the controlling body’s constitution as well as the prescribed instructions.

===The Time===

1.	All matches consist of two periods of 25 minutes each with a half-time interval of three (3) minutes.  The teams change ends at half-time.

2.	Should there be a tie during semi-final and final games, play will continue – 10 minutes on a side without half-time. Should it happen that it is still a tie after this additional time, the ball will be thrown up by the referee at the centre circle and the team that then scores the first goal, is the winner.

3.	Injury time should be added to the specific period of play.  (In competitions where a siren is used to control the time for the matches, the competition rules should include rules concerning injury time.)

4.	Any intentional time wasting is penalised with a penalty.  The following is considered as time wasting:
a)	Taking time to get ready for the restart of the game
b)	Changing of players in the event of injury or voluntary substitution
c)	Putting in of the ball at the outside lines
d)	For the changing of shoes, clothes, etc.
e)	Tossing the ball away

5.	When time of play has run out, the game can only be ended as soon as the ball goes out of play or when a goal was scored.

===The Score===

1.	A successful goal counts two (2) points.

2.	A successful penalty goal counts two (2) points.  A goal shooter may attempt a penalty goal from any position outside the goal circle when it is awarded at the first deliberate offence.

3.	At the second occurrence of inadmissible play, another penalty is awarded and the offending player is yellow carded.

4.	When the same player continuous with inadmissible play, another penalty is awarded. The offending player is red carded and disqualified for five (5) minutes.

5.	If the goal shooter attempts the penalty from behind the penalty line and is successful, three (3) points are awarded.  It is the goal shooter’s own choice to attempt the penalty from behind the penalty line.

6.	A warning, yellow or red card can be awarded by the referee even after a goal has been scored.

===Officials at a Match===

1.	The referee

2.	Two (2) responsible scorekeepers – one (1) from each team who must present themselves to the referee just before the start of play.  Team scorecards are not exchanged and the scorekeepers keep score independently.

3.	A linesman.  The referee shall be assisted by a linesman with a flag.  He assists the referee on the opposite side of the court by indicating when the ball is out of play.  He shall thus indicate where and which team has to put the ball into play.

4.	The linesman must also assist the referee with time keeping.

===Spectators===

1.	Spectators must remain one (1) metre from the outside lines of the court.

2.	Team managers must take up position on the opposite side from where the referee moves and one (1) metre from the outside lines of the court.

3.	Spectators are not allowed to interfere or hinder a goal shooter in his attempt to score a goal.

4.	The referee is entitled to request any member of the controlling body to remove from the court any spectator or official who misbehaves during the match.  The referee can stop the game until such time that the person in question has been removed.

The '''Spectrum''' (later known as '''CoreStates Spectrum''', '''First Union Spectrum''' and '''Wachovia Spectrum''') was an [[indoor arena]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. Opened in the fall of 1967 as part of what is now known as the [[South Philadelphia Sports Complex]], after several expansions of its [[seating capacity]] it accommodated 18,168 for [[basketball]] and 17,380 for [[ice hockey]], [[arena football]], [[indoor soccer]], and [[box lacrosse]].

The last event at the Spectrum was a [[Pearl Jam]] concert on October 31, 2009. The arena was demolished between November 2010 and May 2011.

==History==
Opened as the Spectrum in fall 1967, Philadelphia's first modern indoor sports [[arena]] was built to be the home of the expansion [[Philadelphia Flyers]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], and also to accommodate the existing [[Philadelphia 76ers]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. The building was the second major sports facility built at the south end of [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] in an area previously known as East League Island Park and now referred to simply as the [[South Philadelphia Sports Complex]].

===Early years===
Ground was broken on the arena on June 1, 1966, by [[Jerry Wolman]] and then-Philadelphia Mayor [[James Hugh Joseph Tate|James Tate]] as the home of the NHL's expansion [[Philadelphia Flyers]].&lt;ref name="groundbreaking" /&gt; The first event at the arena was the Quaker City Jazz Festival on September 30, 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bulls game at Wachovia Spectrum highlights Sixers 2008-09 schedule|publisher=[[Philadelphia 76ers]]|url=http://www.nba.com/sixers/news/schedule_080806.html|accessdate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by Larry Magid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Klein |title=Inqlings: Spectrum Last Blasts: Deafening, of Course |date=September 15, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/columnists/michael_klein/20080918_Inqlings__Spectrum_last_blasts__Deafening__of_course.html |accessdate=October 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023230911/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/columnists/michael_klein/20080918_Inqlings__Spectrum_last_blasts__Deafening__of_course.html |archivedate=October 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sporting event at the arena was an October 17, 1967 boxing match featuring [[Joe Frazier]] vs. Tony Doyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Spectrum|publisher=phillyboxinghistory.com|url=http://www.phillyboxinghistory.com/venues/venue_spectrum.htm|accessdate=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1967 through 1972, fifteen fight cards were held at the Spectrum. The NBA's 76ers also moved there from [[Philadelphia Civic Center|Convention Hall]] as a second major league sports tenant. Lou Scheinfeld, former President of the Spectrum, explained that the name "Spectrum" was selected to evoke the broad range of events to be held there.  "The 'SP' for 'sports' and 'South Philadelphia,' 'E' for 'entertainment,' 'C' for 'circuses,' 'T' for 'theatricals,' 'R' for 'recreation,' and 'UM' as 'um, what a nice building!"  Scheinfeld also said that a seat in the city's first superbox initially cost $1,000 a year: "For every Flyers game, Sixers game, circus, you name it, you got 250 events for $1,000."&lt;ref&gt;October 19, 2009, Talk Philly, CBS3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Flyers won their first ever home game in this arena by defeating the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], 1–0. [[Bill Sutherland]] scored the arena's first goal.

On March 1, 1968, wind blew part of the covering off the Spectrum's roof during a performance of the [[Ice Capades]], forcing the building to close for a month while Mayor Tate fought with then-Philadelphia County District Attorney [[Arlen Specter]] over responsibility for the construction of the roof, and the damage was repaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=William|last=Johnson|title=A Heavy Blow In A Windy City|date=April 1, 1968|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1081004/1/index.htm|accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 76ers moved their home games to Convention Hall and to the [[Palestra]], but neither of those arenas had ice rinks at the time, and there were no other NHL-quality sites in the Philadelphia area. Thus the Flyers hurriedly moved their next home game (against the [[Oakland Seals]]) to [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City|New York]] followed by a meeting with the [[Boston Bruins]] played at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in [[Toronto]] before establishing a base at [[Colisée de Québec|Le Colisée]] in [[Quebec City]], home of their top minor league team, the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] [[Quebec Aces]], for the remainder of their regular season, marking the first NHL games in Quebec City in over four decades, and years before the [[Quebec Nordiques]] joined the NHL. (The roof was repaired in time to permit the Flyers to return to the Spectrum to open their first [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs against the [[St. Louis Blues]] on April 4, 1968; the opening faceoff came just as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassinated]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=434641|title=This Date In Flyers History&amp;nbsp;...

A piece of flying debris smashed out one of the concourse windows, cancelling the game just after the first period.

In the 1970s, the venue's location on Broad Street and the reputation for [[Bare-knuckle boxing|fisticuffs]] that the Flyers had developed led to the nickname "Broad Street Bullies."

A plaque inside The Spectrum stated that it held the world record for the fastest conversion from Hockey to Basketball.

The Spectrum, along with the [[Met Center]] and [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], was one of the first sports arenas to have a scoreboard with a messageboard. Furthermore, the messageboards on the Spectrum scoreboard were the first dot matrix screens in pro hockey or basketball, capable of photos, animation, and replays as well as messages.  This was replaced in 1986 with ArenaVision, which consisted of six 9-by-12-foot [[rear-projection television|rear-projection videoscreens]] at the top and a four-sided American Sign and Indicator scoreboard at the bottom.  Inside the videoscreens were [[General Electric]] projectors located 15 feet away from each screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1986-09-16/sports/26072413_1_new-scoreboard-clear-picture-spectrum Juliano, Joe "Spectrum to Unveil New Scoreboard," ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', September 16, 1986]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flyers and 76ers' championships and All-Star Games hosted===
[[File:Spectrumrink.jpg|thumb|left|The Spectrum's ice rink]]
The Flyers won their first [[Stanley Cup]] at the Spectrum on May 19, 1974, defeating the [[Boston Bruins]], 1–0, in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals in front of a then-capacity crowd of 17,007. Perhaps the most important and emotional hockey game—or sporting event of any kind—ever held there, however, came at the height of the [[Cold War]] on January 11, 1976, when the Flyers became the first NHL team to defeat (by 4–1) the vaunted hockey team of the [[HC CSKA Moscow|Soviet Central Red Army]] (ЦСКА). [http://www.cska-hockey.ru/] Two games in the inaugural [[1976 Canada Cup|Canada Cup]] hockey tournament were also held at the Spectrum in September of that year, as the [[United States national men's ice hockey team|U.S.]] took on [[Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and the [[USSR national ice hockey team|USSR]].

Ten NHL or NBA playoff championship series were hosted at the Spectrum. The Flyers competed in the [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup Finals]] in {{scfy|1974}}, {{scfy|1975}}, {{scfy|1976}}, {{scfy|1980}}, {{scfy|1985}}, and {{scfy|1987}}. The 76ers played in the [[NBA Finals]] in {{nbafy|1977}}, {{nbafy|1980}}, {{nbafy|1982}}, and {{nbafy|1983}}. The 1976 and 1992 [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL]], and 1970 and 1976 [[NBA All-Star Game]]s were also held here. The AHL Phantoms also won their first [[Calder Cup]] title on Spectrum ice before a sellout crowd of 17,380 on June 10, 1998, by defeating the [[Saint John Flames]], 6&amp;ndash;1.

The Spectrum is the only venue to host the NBA and NHL All-Star Games in the same season, doing so in 1976, when it also hosted that year's [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]]. It is also one of a handful of venues to host the Stanley Cup and NBA Finals at the same time, doing so in 1980 (all four major Philadelphia teams would reach the championship round of their respective sport in the 1980 season).

===College basketball tournaments===
The Spectrum was used for many basketball tournaments, including [[Philadelphia Big 5|Big Five]] games, eight [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] tournaments (1977, 1983, 1997–2002), the 1975, 1980 and 1992 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] East Regional (site of the famous last-second shot by [[Christian Laettner]] of [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] to beat [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]), and the 1976 and 1981 [[Final Four]]s (both won by [[Bobby Knight]]'s [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]]). Smaller conferences preferred holding tournament games at this venue over the larger Center nearby.

===Bull riding===
In 2003 and 2004, the [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]] brought their [[Built Ford Tough Series]] tour to the Spectrum.

===Notable concerts===
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Spectrum 1974edited.jpg|thumb|''Billboard'' ad for the arena, 1974.]]
Many concerts were been staged at the Spectrum beginning 1960s, often praised for its acoustic properties. In the 1970s, Electric Factory Concerts became the prominent concert promoter for the facility.&lt;ref name="A Philly Guide's Guide"&gt;{{cite book |first=Julie P. |last=Curson |title=A Guide's Guide to Philadelphia |year=1991 |page=256 |location=Philadelphia, PA, US |publisher=Curson House |edition=6th |isbn=0913694061 |oclc=894776363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Pink Floyd]] played the Spectrum in 1972, 1973, 1975 and 1977. They last played two shows there on June 28–29, 1977, during their ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals/In the Flesh]]'' Tour. On the second night (June 29, 1977), Floyd member [[Roger Waters]] fell ill and did most of the show after a painkiller injection. However, the painkiller wore off and was taken to the hospital and missed the final encore of [[Us and Them (song)|"Us and Them"]] where second guitarist [[Snowy White]] had to fill in on bass guitar. Unbeknownst to the crowd, this was the first time that the rest of Pink Floyd (guitarist/vocalist [[David Gilmour]], drummer [[Nick Mason]] and keyboard player [[Rick Wright]]) performed a song live without Waters (they would go on without Waters as of 1986). Waters' experience performing while ill at this venue would be documented on "[[Comfortably Numb]]".

Axl cursed out the fan, and challenged him to a fight. After the fan was ejected from the concert, the show continued.
*On the night of December 9, 1980, after learning of the assassination of [[John Lennon]] following a performance there the night before, [[Bruce Springsteen]] opened the show with a statement regarding Lennon and said, "It's a hard thing to come out and play but there's just nothing else you can do."  With members of the [[E Street Band]] in tears, Springsteen and his band put on a 34-song marathon which ended nearly 3½ hours later, with a cover of "[[Twist and Shout]]". The Spectrum was the first arena Springsteen ever played at in 1976. In the following years, Springsteen would become one of the Spectrum's most popular concert acts, performing 42 shows between 1976 and 2009, thanks in part to the singer's large and devoted fan base in Pennsylvania. For these reasons, the Spectrum is often considered one of Springsteen's iconic venues.
*[[Van Halen]] performed at the Spectrum with [[Gary Cherone]] on 24 May 1998.
*[[Whitney Houston]] performed at the arena on June 23, 1994, during her successful 1993–94 [[The Bodyguard World Tour]]. The concert included her performing a medley of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s classics and a duet with husband at that time [[Bobby Brown]], performed their R&amp;B hit "[[Something in Common]]".

*The last public events at the legendary arena took place on October 27–28 and 30–31, 2009, by [[Pearl Jam]]. The band came to the stage each night after a video montage of memorable Spectrum moments followed by the ''[[Rocky]]'' theme music. Over the four nights, Pearl Jam performed 103 different songs, with its final night on [[Halloween]] lasting over 3 hours and 35 minutes and including 41 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/reviewsNews/idUSTRE5A25FC20091103|title=Pearl Jam closes Philly Spectrum with epic set|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=November 3, 2009|agency=Reuters|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectrum Theater===
The Spectrum Theater was a venue for acts not big enough to fill the entire Spectrum arena. The stage was placed in the middle of the Spectrum floor, and the other half of the arena behind the stage was closed off with curtains, creating a theater-like environment. Some of the acts that played in this configuration included [[Frank Zappa]] in 1973, 1976 and 1977; David Bowie's [[Diamond Dogs Tour]] in 1974; [[The Kinks]]' Soap Opera Tour in May 1975, [[Bob Marley]]'s [[Natty Dread Tour]] in 1975 and [[Kaya Tour]] in 1978; [[Bruce Springsteen]] in 1976; The [[Bee Gees]] in 1979; [[Peter Gabriel]]'s tour in 1982, [[Julian Lennon|Jullian Lennon]] with Chris Bliss on June 20, 1986, and [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]] in 1987.

===The Flyers and 76ers' move===
The 1995–96 [[1995–96 NHL season|NHL]] and [[1995–96 NBA season|NBA]] seasons were the final ones for the Flyers and the 76ers at the Spectrum. The Sixers' last game was a 112–92 loss to the [[Orlando Magic]] on April 19; on May 12, [[Mike Hough]] of the [[Florida Panthers]] scored the arena's final official NHL goal in the 2nd overtime of Game 5 of the [[1996 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1996 Eastern Conference Semifinals]]. Although both the Flyers and 76ers moved across the parking lot to the new and larger [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]] (then CoreStates Center), the arena remained in place and was used by the [[Philadelphia Phantoms]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]], the [[Philadelphia Kixx]] of the [[National Indoor Soccer League|NISL]], the [[Philadelphia Soul]] of the [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]] for Saturday home games, and a variety of other sporting events and concerts.

The Flyers and 76ers had been in need of a new facility for some time.  One reason was the need for more revenue streams to meet skyrocketing operating costs. The Spectrum had relatively few luxury suites or other amenities common in newer arenas.

In addition, the arena's sight lines left much to be desired.  Some seats in both the hockey and basketball configurations (especially those added in the upper level over the years) had badly obstructed views.  There was only one [[concourse]] for all three levels, making for somewhat cramped conditions whenever attendance was anywhere near capacity.

===Final season===
[[File:Spectrum remember.jpg|thumb|right|A special logo was used for the final season of the Spectrum's use, featuring the arena's original pre-1994 logo and nickname.]]
On July 14, 2008, [[Comcast Spectacor]] Chairman [[Ed Snider]] officially announced that the Spectrum would be shuttered and torn down to make way for ''[[Xfinity Live! Philadelphia|Philly Live!]]'', a proposed retail, dining and entertainment hub. "This has been one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make," said Snider. "The Spectrum is my baby. It's one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me."

The Phantoms commemorated the final season of the Spectrum by wearing a special patch on their uniforms, as illustrated on the right. The team also celebrated some of the building's memorable moments throughout the season. The Flyers marked the last season by playing two pre-season games at the Spectrum. They played the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in an NHL pre-season game on September 27, 2008, and the Phantoms on October 7 of that same year. Before the game against Carolina, the Flyers honored the team captains in the franchise's history. Those honored in the pre-game ceremony were [[Lou Angotti]], [[Ed Van Impe]], [[Bobby Clarke|Bob Clarke]], [[Mel Bridgman]], [[Bill Barber]], [[Dave Poulin]], [[Ron Sutter]], [[Kevin Dineen]], [[Éric Desjardins]], [[Keith Primeau]] and [[Derian Hatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam|last=Carchidi|title=Flyers Captains Bid Farewell to Spectrum|date=September 28, 2008|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20080928_Flyers_captains_bid_farewell_to_Spectrum.html|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spectrum Final Game April 10, 2009.jpg|thumb|left|125px]]The Phantoms' last regular season game at the Spectrum was played April 10, 2009, against the [[Hershey Bears]], as the Phantoms won the game, 5–2, while the last Kixx game was against the [[Massachusetts Twisters]] on March 22. The Kixx moved onto the [[Temple University]] campus and played the 2009–10 season at the [[Liacouras Center]]. The Phantoms were sold to a Pittsburgh-based ownership group, and moved to [[Glens Falls, New York]], for the 2009–10 season.

"With this season being the final season of the Wachovia Spectrum, we will celebrate the history of the Spectrum with an exciting, year-long, celebration of events," Comcast Spectacor President Peter Luukko said.  [[Phish]] was rumored to be among the acts to commemorate the closing of the arena. "It is our hope and intent to bring back many of the musical acts and entertainers who have made the Spectrum 'America's Showplace.{{' "}} [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]] played two shows at The Spectrum on April 28 and 29 as part of their [[Working on a Dream Tour]], and returned on October 13–14 and 19–20 for their Spectrum swan song. Springsteen debuted a specially-written version of the song [[Wrecking Ball (Bruce Springsteen album)|"Wrecking Ball"]], which he had written in honor of the demolition of [[Giants Stadium]], with revised lyrics to honor the Spectrum. Springsteen's performances were followed by  [[Pearl Jam]] on October 27, 28, 30 and 31 to close the building; their opening acts included [[Social Distortion]] on the 27th and 28th and [[Bad Religion]] on the 30th and 31st.

A scheduled concert with [[Leonard Cohen]] on October 22 was moved to the [[Tower Theatre (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania)|Tower Theatre]] in [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania]], instead. On October 23, 2009, Philadelphia area musicians [[The Hooters]], [[Todd Rundgren]] and [[Hall &amp; Oates]] headlined a concert titled "Last Call". [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/20091024_Philly_pop_stars_rock_hard_at_the_Spectrum.html] Tickets were as low as $6.00. The remaining members of [[The Grateful Dead]]; including Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann performed their final set of shows at the Spectrum on May 1 and 2, 2009; the May 2 show was their 54th consecutive sell-out at the Spectrum. The Dead closed the May 2 show with the song "[[Samson and Delilah (song)|Samson and Delilah]]". The song contains the fitting refrain "If I had my way, I would tear this old building down." The lyric was changed by the band's singer [[Bob Weir]] to say "I wouldn't tear this old building down." With the demolition of The Spectrum, all venues at which The Grateful Dead played through their career within the City Of Philadelphia, except for the Irvine Auditorium, have succumbed to the wrecking ball.

==The Spectrum &amp; the South Philadelphia Sports Complex==
[[File:South Philadelphia Sports Complex 2008.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An overhead view of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. The Spectrum is at center left.]]
Opened in 1967 as the first of the five modern facilities to be built at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex between 1967 and 2004, by the time it closed in 2009 the Spectrum was the oldest of the four venues still standing of the two indoor arenas and four outdoor stadiums built at the South end of Broad Street since 1926. The complex's total area expanded with the addition of each new facility and now takes up the entire SE quadrant of the [http://www.phillyhistory.org/photoarchive/newsletter/08dec/phillyhistory_newsletter_dec_08.htm grounds] occupied in 1926 by Philadelphia's [[Sesquicentennial Exposition|Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition]], a massive 184-day [[World's fair]] built on 700+ acres of until then largely undeveloped city owned swamp and park land (including [[League Island Park]]) adjacent to the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard|U.S. Navy Yard]] bounded by 10th Street, Packer Ave., 23rd Street, and Terminal Avenue. The Spectrum itself occupied the portion of the Exposition's grounds on the south side of Pattison Avenue between Broad and 11th Streets that in 1926 served as the fair's main trolley terminal operated by the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority#History|Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin|first=E.L.|author2=Odell Hauser |title=The Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition|year=1929|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philadelphia Sports Complex 1973.jpg|thumb|right|The Spectrum, with [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] above it and [[Veterans Stadium]] below it]]
For its first 25 years, the Spectrum overlooked the 102,000-seat [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] (known prior to 1964 as "Municipal Stadium") located roughly 600 feet south of the indoor arena. Opened on April 15, 1926, the stadium was also the Sesqui-Centennial Exposition's only intentionally permanent facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin|first=E.L.|author2=Odell Hauser |title=The Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition|chapter=Chapter XXX "MUNICIPAL STADIUM"|year=1929|location=Philadelphia|pages=419–423}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of 42 [[Army–Navy Game]]s between 1936 and 1979, JFK Stadium eventually fell into disuse in favor of the newer nearby Veterans Stadium, was condemned in 1989, and demolished in 1992 to make way for the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]] which opened four years later in August, 1996. Known earlier as the "CoreStates Center" (1996–1998), the "First Union Center" (1998–2003), and the "Wachovia Center" (July 2003 – June 2010), the 20,000-plus-seat indoor arena replaced the Spectrum as the home of the Flyers, 76ers, and [[Philadelphia Wings (1987–2014)|Philadelphia Wings]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] beginning with each club's 1996–97 season. With the demolition of the Spectrum, the Wells Fargo Center has now become the oldest of the complex's three current venues.

The Spectrum's closest sports complex neighbor was [[Veterans Stadium]] (opened 1971, closed 2003, demolished 2004) which was located north of the arena directly across Pattison Avenue. The 60,000-plus-seat "Vet" accommodated [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]'s [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]] for just over three decades before it was itself replaced by two new facilities. In 2003 the Eagles moved to [[Lincoln Financial Field]], a purpose built football/soccer stadium located SE of the Spectrum site directly across 11th Street from the Wells Fargo Center. The following year, the Phillies relocated to [[Citizens Bank Park]], a dedicated baseball stadium completed in 2004 and located diagonally across from the Spectrum site at the northeast corner of Pattison Ave and Citizens Bank Way (11th St.), immediately east of the former Veterans Stadium site which now serves as a parking lot for the entire complex. In 2017, the Phillies' spring training complex in [[Clearwater, Florida]] was renamed [[Spectrum Field]] after [[Bright House Networks]] was purchased by [[Charter Communications, Inc.|Charter Communications]]. While named for Charter's residential service, the name invoked memories of the Spectrum arena.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Zolecki.

==Demolition==
Although the Spectrum formally closed on October 31, 2009, demolition of the structure did not begin for more than a year with internal work commencing on November 8, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellsfargocenterphilly.com/news.aspx?story=908 "Preparations For Spectrum Demolition To Begin On November 8:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107153435/http://www.wellsfargocenterphilly.com/news.aspx?story=908 |date=2010-11-07 }} News release, Wells Fargo Center November 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later a public "wrecking ball ceremony" attended by some of the athletes who made the building famous such as [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]rs [[Bernie Parent]] and [[Bobby Clarke|Bob Clarke]] of the Flyers and [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Julius Erving]] of the 76ers, was held in the adjacent parking lot "H" on November 23, 2010, to formally begin its external demolition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2010/11/24/news/doc4cec92b74a553571921980.txt ''With pomp and circumstances (and a wrecking ball), the Spectrum starts to come down''] The Delaware County ''Daily Times'', November 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Veterans Stadium, its one-time neighbor, which had been located immediately across Pattison Avenue from the Spectrum before it was imploded on March 21, 2004, the almost half-year process of demolishing the then-44-year-old arena, done without the use of explosives, was completed in May 2011.

A 300-room hotel is planned to eventually be built on the demolished Spectrum's site (which is now occupied by a parking lot) as an adjunct to the ''[[Xfinity Live!]]'' project the first portion of which was opened in April, 2012, at the SW corner of 11th Street and Pattison Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rememberthespectrum.com/pdf/PhillyReview_PhillyLive-10-9-08.pdf  ''Going Live!

==Statues==
{{Portal|Philadelphia}}A [[statue]] of [[Sylvester Stallone]], depicted in his role of Philadelphia [[boxing|boxer]] [[Rocky Balboa]], stood for many years in front of the main (Pattison Avenue) entrance of the Spectrum, which had been represented in the movie as the site of Rocky's [[Rocky|first]] and [[Rocky II|second]] fights with [[Apollo Creed]]. (The fight sequences were actually filmed at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]].) The statue was removed several times over the years to be used in the filming of sequels to the original film. In September 2006, it was given a new home in an area near the base of the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] not far from where a spot on the plaza at the top of the Museum's steps where it had appeared in the film ''[[Rocky III]]''. Since the statue was not deemed "art,"{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} it was moved around the corner of the museum on Kelly Drive. Other statues that stood in the arena area included:

*"Score!", a statue depicting Flyers' right-wing [[Gary Dornhoefer]]'s game-winning overtime goal in Game 5 of the 1973 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals against the [[Minnesota North Stars]];

'''TD Stadium''' (formerly known as TD Waterhouse Stadium&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfpress.com/2013/08/27/western-universitys-td-waterhouse-stadium-renamed|title=TD Waterhouse Stadium renamed|last=nurun.com|website=The London Free Press|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 8,000-seat [[Canadian football]] [[stadium]] located at 100 [[Philip Aziz]] Avenue on the campus of the [[University of Western Ontario]] in [[London, Ontario]]. It was built in 2000 at a cost of approximately $10.5-million and replaced [[J.W. Little Stadium]].

It has a standard rubber track, 4 sandpits and an artificial turf.

It also hosts annual [[Track and Field]] Championships.

In addition to playing host to the [[Western Mustangs]] and [[London Beefeaters]] teams, TD Stadium was also used as the main venue for the 2001 [[Canada Summer Games]]. The stadium is expandable to a capacity of about 16,000; it has been expanded temporarily a few times in its history including for an exhibition [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] game in 2002 between the [[Toronto Argonauts]] and [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] which was a sellout at 9,178 fans.

It also holds host to all ''Red Feather'' games, in which local senior high school football teams play their first game of the season. Students are brought to the events to cheer on their team, the student body that cheers best wins a spirit award.

In summer 2007, the AstroTurf was replaced by FieldTurf at a cost of approximately 1 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/OtherSports/2007/06/19/4272720-sun.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2009 the newly formed FC London of the USL Premier Development League began playing their home games at TD Stadium.

For the fact the club needs to finish stadium renovation in time for MNL 2017 season, the construction process will strictly be maintenance of the old stadium stands and the grass field. There is not any plan to build anything new. Club officials announced the renovated stadium's capacity will be around 7,000 although it remains to be seen whether the estimated figures are met in next year or not.

'''Walt Disney World Speedway''' was a racing facility located on the grounds of the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Bay Lake, Florida|Bay Lake]], [[Florida]], near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]].

It was built in 1995 by IMS Events, Inc., a subsidiary of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] Corporation, and was designed primarily as a venue for the Indy 200 at Walt Disney World, an [[Indy Racing League]] event.

The circuit's primary use was as a venue for the [[Richard Petty]] Driving Experience, and the Indy Racing Experience, programs that allows fans to drive or ride in real race cars. After the 2000 racing season, it was no longer used as a track for major motorsports racing series, but was used by many racing teams from IndyCar to NASCAR as a test venue due to the warmer climate than other tracks around the United States during the off season for racing. The track closed permanently on August 9, 2015.

''[[AutoWeek]]'' magazine and the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' dubbed the track "'''The Mickyard'''" (a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of the Disney icon [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]'s nickname, the "Brickyard").

==History==
[[File:WaltDisneyWorldSpeedway RichardPettyDrivingExperience.jpg|thumb|left|A student practicing at Walt Disney World Speedway in 2010]]
The track was a three-turn [[tri-oval]], designed by Indianapolis Motor Speedway chief [[civil engineer|engineer]] Kevin Forbes, and the location was chosen in September 1994 by Greg Ruse of [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Buena Vista]] Construction. The track was situated on a triangular plot of land adjacent to the [[Magic Kingdom]]'s [[parking lot]] near [[Disney's Polynesian Resort]]. Plans for the track were first announced on January 23, 1995.  The track was designed to fit within the boundaries of the existing infrastructure, requiring minimal rerouting of existing roads.

On June 27, 1995, [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] Chairman of the Board [[Mari Hulman George]] took part in a groundbreaking ceremony. She presented the track with one of the original paving bricks from the famous "Brickyard." In a rather compact schedule, the one-mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) track was completed with ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) of safety restraint cabling, {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of fencing, {{convert|1800|yd|m}} of concrete for outside walls, {{convert|2300|ft|m}} of concrete for pit walls and 5,200 tons of asphalt for the track surface. Despite 1995 having the wettest June–July in Orlando on record (75&amp;nbsp;inches of rain), including [[Hurricane Erin (1995)|Hurricane Erin]], the construction was completed on-time, with final paving completed October 18, 1995.

The track was dedicated on November 28, 1995. [[Indy Racing League]] drivers [[Arie Luyendyk]], [[Eddie Cheever]], [[Eliseo Salazar]], [[Lyn St. James]] and [[Davey Hamilton]] drove a five-car "Flying V" formation amongst fireworks. Initial testing at the facility for the Indy Racing League took place November 27–December 9, 1995.

The race track hosting its first car race, a [[Formula Ford 2000]] support race on January 26, 1996 followed the next day with the [[Indy Racing League]]'s Indy 200 car race.&lt;ref&gt;[https://d23.com/a-to-z/walt-disney-world-speedway/ Walt Disney World Speedway]. Disney A to Z&amp;nbsp;— The Updated Official Encyclopedia, by Dave Smith, 1998. Page 597.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 7, 1997, the first racing experience program, the Richard Petty Driving Experience, opened at the Speedway.&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]], December 8, 1996, Volume 146, Number 50635.

===Closure and demolition===
On March 27, 2015, it was announced that the speedway would close on August 9, 2015 and be razed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201502/4417/|title=Walt Disney World Speedway to Close in June|work=Theme Park Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition began late August to make way for "transportation improvements",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/indycar/walt-disney-world-speedway-shutting-down-good|title=Walt Disney World Speedway shutting down for good|work=Autoweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely expanding and reconfiguring the Magic Kingdom parking lot and parking entrance.

==Design==
Walt Disney World Speedway was constructed on a very limited budget. By design, permanent features of the facility were built at a minimum. The track plans called for only the track surface, retaining wall, and [[catch fence]] to be constructed. The remainder of the facility, such as seating areas, restrooms, and race support areas would be built on a temporary, as-needed basis. This strategy had never been used on an oval race track, but had been widely successful for years in temporary [[street circuit]]s (such as [[Long Beach Grand Prix|Long Beach]]). No permanent garages were built on the premises, but this was not entirely unusual. Race teams would simply work out of their transporters, a practice used frequently at street circuits and other tracks without garages.

The initial savings in construction costs was significant. Temporary bleachers and restroom facilities would be erected each year beginning in November, in preparations for the races in January. The lack of permanent grandstands also allowed track officials to adjust the configuration and capacity of seating annually reflecting ticket demand. This practice, however, would prove to be inconvenient and increasingly expensive in the long run since the grandstand area encompassed a portion of the [[Magic Kingdom]] parking lot. That area of the lot would be unusable for nearly three months, including during the busy [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Eve|New Year's]] holiday season at the theme park.

Three linked ponds in the track’s infield are formed in the shape of [[Mickey Mouse]]. The pond, dubbed "Lake Mickey", was built a year after the track opened due to drainage concerns.

===Parking problems===
Initially, the track location, which was adjacent to the Magic Kingdom parking lot, was seen to be convenient. However, after a couple of years, traffic control on race days became overwhelming. Because race spectators would arrive at the same time and place as regular Magic Kingdom theme park guests, overflow parking was required. In 1996–1997, Disney officials reacted by parking all race spectators in the Magic Kingdom parking lot, and diverting all Magic Kingdom guests to the [[Epcot]] parking lot. Race spectators would walk to the nearby Speedway, while all guests to the Magic Kingdom were required to take the [[Walt Disney World Monorail System|monorail]] or a [[Disney Transport|bus]] from Epcot to the Transportation and Ticket Center. There, they would transfer to a monorail on the Magic Kingdom loop, a somewhat circuitous trip which resulted in numerous guest complaints. In 1997, the IRL race was shortened by a sudden rainstorm, causing fans to hurry to their cars and resulting in severe traffic [[gridlock]] on [[Florida State Road 536|World Drive]] and surrounding roads which lasted for several hours.

Starting in 1998, race spectators were diverted to park at Epcot, and were taken by shuttle bus to the Speedway while guests to the Magic Kingdom were directed to park, as usual, in the Magic Kingdom parking lot. While this eased many theme park guest complaints, it was now inconvenient for race spectators as it necessitated them to arrive earlier to account for the additional travel time. It additionally resulted in a significant cost increase in race operations, as the [[Disney Transport]] bus fleet was not big enough to accommodate the race shuttle operation. As a result, outside bus companies had to be hired to run the race shuttle service.

==End of professional racing==
[[File:Sam Schmidt - Carb Day 2015 - Sarah Stierch.jpg|thumbnail|Sam Schmidt was paralyzed after an accident at Walt Disney World Speedway in 2000]]
In its first few years of operation, the track was used frequently as a year-round test facility, due to the warm winter weather in Orlando. However, the track suffered three major accidents. During a week of preseason testing, on January 11, 1997, IRL driver Eliseo Salazar crashed in turn one. He suffered a fracture of his lower back, and missed two races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7412&amp;FS=IRL|title=IRL: WDW test 97-1-11|work=Motorsport.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014527/http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7412&amp;FS=IRL|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, on January 23, 1997, IRL driver [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]] broke his neck after a practice crash in turn three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7487&amp;FS=IRL|title=IRL: WDW Thursday practice notes|work=Motorsport.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023740/http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=7487&amp;FS=IRL|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 6, 2000, IRL driver [[Sam Schmidt]] was [[paralysis|paralyzed]] after a crash in preseason testing.&lt;ref name="Sentinel01-07-2000pg19"&gt;{{cite news|title=Crash at Disney paralyzes IRL driver|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22795022/sam_schmidt/|first=Juliet|last=Macur|newspaper=The Orlando Sentinel|page=19|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=January 19, 2000|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track was built before the [[SAFER barrier]] was introduced, which many feel may have lessened the injuries in all three cases.

After the [[2000 Indy Racing League|2000]] IRL season, series officials and Walt Disney World were not able to come to an agreement for a race date for [[2001 Indy Racing League|2001]]. IRL officials were unsatisfied with the January date, as it was seen to be too early for most teams to be prepared for the season. There was typically a six-week gap until the second race of the season. Disney officials also were concerned with the impending conflict with [[Super Bowl XXXV]], to be held in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] presumably the same weekend. Initial talks planned to move the race date to [[Labor Day]] weekend, and ultimately to a new facility to be built near [[U.S. Route 192|U.S. 192]]. The [[NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]] had already declined to renew its contract with the Speedway for similar reasons after 1998. The talks quietly ceased between the IRL and Disney, and the race was not scheduled for 2001. It was ultimately removed from the IRL schedule permanently.

===Richard Petty Driving Experience / Indy Racing Experience / Exotic Driving Experience===
During the off-season in 1997, the track began hosting the Richard Petty Driving Experience, a stock car-based racing organization that allowed the general public to drive real [[NASCAR]] machines, or ride along with a professional driver and served as the track's primary function, year-round. It was the only track used by the ''RPDE'' that, weather permitting, operated roughly 365 days a year. To assist in the increased ingress and egress, a one-lane automobile [[tunnel]] was built for the 1997 season. In the summer of 1999, a new visitor's center and gift shop was built to permanently house operations for ''RPDE''. A new modest garage facility was built for them also. The operation had previously worked out of trailers and tents, without significant utilities.

On November 13, 2008, it was announced that track would be shared with the Indy Racing Experience, a similar program to ''RPDE''. The [[open wheel car|IndyCar]] two-seater machine would be used for fan ride-alongs, and Indy cars would also be available to be driven by fans. After appearing at various tracks on a largely irregular schedule, the Indy Racing Experience made the track its permanent year-round home.

On January 16, 2012, a new driving experience started business at Walt Disney World Speedway geared towards high end "supercars" called the Exotic Driving Experience. Modifications were made to the speedway's infield to create an "Exotics Course" which was a one-mile layout that ran clockwise and combined part of the oval with a street-style course.

===Other uses===
*On February 19–20, 1999, the track hosted the 7th Annual SunDay Challenge Alternative Energy Vehicle Rally. The highlight of the meet featured the [[Formula Lightning]] teams of [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], [[Kettering University|Kettering]], and [[Florida A&amp;M University|FAMU]]/[[Florida State University|FSU]]. The event was covered by [[Central Florida News 13]].
*On April 9, 2002 the first test of the new [[Indy Pro Series|Infiniti Pro Series]] was conducted at the track, with [[Robby McGehee]] driving over {{convert|100|mi|km}}. The series debuted later that season.
*The track has been part of the [[Walt Disney World]] [[Marathon]] course in some years.

==Incidents==
{{Main article|Incidents at Walt Disney World}}
From 1995–2015, the track experienced one fatal accident. On April 12, 2015, driving instructor Gary Terry, 36, was fatally injured after a crash during a run as part of the Exotic Driving Experience. Terry was riding in the passenger seat of a [[Lamborghini Gallardo]] [[Lamborghini Gallardo#Gallardo Superleggera|LP570-4 Superleggera]], when the driver lost control and crashed into a metal guardrail. Terry died at the scene while the driver, identified as 24-year-old Tavon Watson, was transported to the hospital with minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wtsp.com/story/news/local/2015/04/12/fatal-crash-at-richard-petty-experience/25684239/|title=Crash at Disney World auto racing attraction kills 1|publisher=10 News|date=April 13, 2015|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florida Highway Patrol]] investigated and announced that, while the decision to run vehicles clockwise (instead of counterclockwise as the track was designed for) may have been a factor in the incident, it was an accident and no charges were filed against the driver since it was on private property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FHP releases report in fatal crash at Walt Disney World Speedway|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/news/local/fhp-released-report-fatal-crash-walt-disney-world-/nnPFk/|website=wftv.com|publisher=WFTV|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adaptive Sports USA''' (formerly the '''National Wheelchair Athletic Association, Wheelchair Sports USA,''' and '''Wheelchair &amp; Ambulatory Sports, USA''') is a registered multi-sport organization of the United States Olympic Committee/the U.S. Paralympics dedicated to promoting healthy lifestyles by implementing sports and recreation opportunities for children and adults with a physical disability. Mostly a volunteer organization, Adaptive Sports USA works in conjunction with local and regional sports organizations to develop and promote sanctioned sporting events for youths and adults with a physical disability. The mission of Adaptive Sports USA is to engage, evolve, and empower individuals with a disability to be involved in adaptive sport through education, coaching and advocacy. By creating a community outreach program, Adaptive Sports USA increases opportunities for individuals with a disability and are a gateway to regional, national and international multi-sport competitions.

Each year Adaptive Sports USA sponsors the Adaptive Sports USA Junior Nationals (formerly the [[National Junior Disability Championships]] [NJDC]), the longest continually run competition for athletes with a physical disability in the United States.

== History ==
Adaptive Sports USA has a long and storied history in providing competitive sports opportunities to individuals with a disability. Founded in 1956 as the National Wheelchair Athletic Association, the early years of wheelchair sports were successful in large part due to the efforts of Benjamin Lipton, the Bulova Watch Company and the Bulova School of Watchmaking. Mr. Lipton was the Executive Director of the Bulova School of Watchmaking and served as the Chairman of NWAA for the first 25 years of its existence. Mr. Lipton ensured the viability of the organization during the early years by making the Bulova Company a primary financial supporter of NWAA. The initial impetus to organize NWAA grew out of the interests of athletes with disabilities - many of whom were veterans of World War II. They wanted to participate in sports other than basketball, a sport that had seen rapid growth in the early 1950s through teams sponsored by veterans hospitals and other rehabilitation agencies. General Omar N. Bradley was one of the leaders of the early efforts to develop wheelchair sports programs, principally for servicemen injured during the war. In the early days, many wheelchair basketball players saw participation in individual wheelchair sports as supplementary training for their primary interest in basketball. However, the NWAA program appealed to even greater numbers of athletes with disabilities due to the incorporation of women and athletes with quadriplegia, populations that could not be easily accommodated by Basketball. Europe’s first organized wheelchair sports program was introduced in 1948 by well-known neurosurgeon, Dr. Ludwig Guttman, founder of the Spinal Injury Center in Stoke Mandeville, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tswaa.com/wheelchair_sports_usa_history.htm|title=WASUSA History|website=www.tswaa.com|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Stoke Mandeville Games included only twenty-six participants, and few events (shot put, javelin, club throw, and archery) but growth in both the number of events and participants developed quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://iwbf.org/the-game/history-wheelchair-basketball/|title=History of Wheelchair Basketball|date=2018-01-11|work=IWBF - International Wheelchair Basketball Federation|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, a team from the Netherlands was invited to compete with the British team. This was the first International Stoke Mandeville Games, an event that is generally recognized as the precursor to the present day Paralympic Games. The focus for NWAA and later, WSUSA, during the first four decades was competitive sports opportunities in the identified “core sports” for individuals utilizing wheelchairs for mobility. Following Mr. Lipton’s tenure, the national office of NWAA moved to Colorado Springs, CO in 1982 in an effort to be closer to the National Governing Bodies of the core sports of NWAA recognized by the US Olympic Committee. It was during this time frame that NWAA played a key role in putting competitive sports for athletes with disabilities on the international stage by promoting a series of exhibition events in Wheelchair Track at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

From its earliest beginnings to the present day, Adaptive Sports USA, has been directed and developed by wheelchair athletes and wheelchair sports enthusiasts themselves, individuals with a first-hand understanding to the values of participation. By and large, the needs of the athlete with a disability are not addressed by the vast network of athletic programs available to able-bodied persons through our educational system and community recreation agencies. Instead, the athlete with a disability has, with rare exceptions, developed his or her own resources and sports opportunities, from rules and governing structure (i.e., Adaptive Sports USA) to funding travel, equipment and other expenses of competition. Adaptive sports enthusiasts are involved at all levels of decision-making in the Adaptive Sports USA, and its constituent associations. Adaptive Sports USA, has remained essentially an all-volunteer organization, drawing on the energy and commitment of the people who also benefit from its programs. Adaptive sports have also been described as the most authentic of sports enterprises because the athletes compete and develop their own opportunities for the intrinsic values of participation – and not for the promise of professional contracts or financial reward. The dreams of individual athletes have been made possible through the efforts and dedication of pioneers such as Dr. Guttman and Lipton, and the countless other organizers, volunteers, friends, and supporters of adaptive sports throughout the United States and the rest of the world. With the continuing increase in public awareness, the future of adaptive athletic competition is indeed bright.

In 1994, the organizational name was changed to Wheelchair Sports, USA to more accurately reflect the organization’s mission. As a result of several Disabled Sports Organizations (DSO’s) dissolving that represented the sporting interests for a specific segment of the disabled population, including organizations representing athletes with Cerebral Palsy and “Les Autres” athletes, Wheelchair Sports, USA found its mission changing dramatically from providing sports opportunities to individuals using wheelchairs to serving as a comprehensive competitive sports organization for all individuals with a disability, both ambulatory and non-ambulatory. As a result, in 2010, the organizational name was changed to Wheelchair &amp; Ambulatory Sports USA and in 2015 to Adaptive Sports USA in an effort to better describe the mission that evolved for the organization. It was also within this time frame that Adaptive Sports USA entered into a formal relationship with the International Wheelchair &amp; Ambulatory Sports Federation (IWAS), an offshoot of the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation. By virtue of this relationship, Adaptive Sports USA found itself with a mechanism for providing quality competitive opportunities for athletes seeking to establish themselves on an international stage. This relationship continues to the present.

Adaptive Sports USA has managed to host the preeminent competitive sports event for junior athletes (6 - 22) with a disability in the United States continuously since 1984. Now known as the Adaptive Sports USA Junior Nationals (formerly the [[National Junior Disability Championships]] [NJDC]), the event has had several titles in its nearly 30 years of existence. The Junior Nationals is a week-long competition including Archery, Powerlifting, Swimming, Table Tennis, Track &amp; Field, and other sporting events.

==History of Adaptive Sports USA Junior Nationals==
Junior Nationals is an avenue for young athletes to showcase their abilities through sport and to promote physical activity and socialization. Additionally, the Championships serve as an opportunity for individuals to advance along the athlete pipeline that may one day lead them to compete at the international level and the Paralympic Games.

Junior Nationals began in 1984 with three sanctioned events for wheelchair athlete’s ages 7 to 19 and is now the largest annual multi-sport event for juniors with physical disabilities and/or visual impairments in the United States. Junior Nationals is contested in a different city annually in July. This provides an opportunity for athletes to explore diverse areas of the country, travel costs to remain neutral and allows various Local Hosts the opportunity to gain experience in event management and build a legacy.
