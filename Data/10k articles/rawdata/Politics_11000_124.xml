The '''All-Polish Youth''' ({{lang-pl|Młodzież Wszechpolska}}) is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[List of youth organizations|youth organization]] based on [[ultra-nationalism|ultra-nationalist]] and [[fascist]]&lt;ref name="Minkenberg2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Minkenberg|title=The Radical Right in Eastern Europe: Democracy under Siege?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbXQDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|year=2017|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-56332-3|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; doctrines, formerly affiliated with the [[League of Polish Families]], with a Catholic-nationalist philosophy. Its agenda declares that its aim is to raise Polish youth in a Catholic and patriotic spirit. It currently plays a major role as part of the [[National Movement (Poland)|National Movement party]].

Its manifesto from 1989 states, for example, that "''one's country is the greatest earthly good. After [[God]], your foremost love belongs to the Homeland, and foremost after God you must serve your own country,''" and declares itself opposed to "doctrines promoting [[liberalism]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], and [[relativism]].
The earliest roots of Polish Youth reach back to 1922, the organisation was delegalised in 1934 and the present incarnation was created on December 2, 1989. Polish Youth was affiliated with the [[League of Polish Families]], but was never officially its youth wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80708,4615980.html |title=Młodzież Wszechpolska: LPR nie może nas rozwiązać |website=Gazeta.pl Wiadomości |date=26 October 2007 |access-date=26 September 2017 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, All-Polish Youth have been widely condemned as [[homophobic]] by various organisations including [[Amnesty International]],&lt;ref name="amnestyusa.org"&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/447ff7b511.html Amnesty International Report 2006 - Poland (archived by UNHRC, United Nations Refugee Agency)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/02/14/poland-official-homophobia-threatens-human-rights Human Rights Watch (Scott Long)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[http://www.upr-info.org/IMG/pdf/AI_CZE_add1.pdf UN Human Rights Council - Universal Periodic Review, Annual Report 2005 (page 6)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728145636/http://www.upr-info.org/IMG/pdf/AI_CZE_add1.pdf |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-war All-Polish Youth ==

The organisation, properly the Academic Union "All-Polish Youth" (''Związek Akademicki "Młodzież Wszechpolska"''), was founded in 1922 as an ideological youth organisation with a strong nationalist sentiment,&lt;ref&gt;Wapiński 1980, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the largest student organisation in the [[Second Polish Republic]]. The Founding Convention of the All-Polish youth took place in March 1922, with [[Roman Dmowski]] being selected honorary chairman.

The term "All-Polish" is intended to represent a desire to unify all Polish lands, and accentuate national ties and the equality of all people of Polish origin regardless of their wealth or social status. The idea for creating the organization occurred when Poland was partitioned and not officially on the world map, therefore it aimed to unite Poles from all three partitions. In the inter-war period, members of the organisation participated actively in academic life, and became the heads of many student organisations. The All-Polish Youth was the largest student organization in Poland during the 1930s. The goals of the organization were mainly focused on three issues:&lt;ref&gt;Kulińska 2000, 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Defending the autonomy of universities against centralising forces of the government
# Campaigning for lower tuition fees
# Limitation of non-Polish, especially Jewish students, from higher education to prevent exclusion of Polish students from the countryside

All-Polish Youth was the least radical of organizations of the [[National Democracy]] camp.&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Misztal, “Związek Akademicki Młodzież Wszechpolska 1922-1939, p. 164.″&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some of its members praised [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and his [[Italian fascism]] for its hardline stances towards the left and realisation of "national revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Wapiński 1980, 243-244&lt;/ref&gt;. Most leaders of the All-Polish Youth criticized Hitler for racism and radicalism. According to [[Jan Mosdorf]], a pre-war chairman of All-Polish Youth who died in Auschwitz for saving Jews, the organization was against fascists and Hitlerites.&lt;ref&gt;Mateusz Kotas, "Jan Mosdorf. Filozof, ideolog, polityk, p. 45."&lt;/ref&gt; Some Members of the All-Polish Youth also praised authoritarian regimes of the Mediterranean, [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]'s [[Portugal]] and [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[Spain]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

They also favoured economically boycotting the [[Jew]]s, limiting their access to higher education ([[numerus clausus]])&lt;ref&gt;Wapiński 1980, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to equal the chance of children from countryside families who had very limited access to education to the chance of the children of Jewish families living in the towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Misztal, “Związek Akademicki Młodzież Wszechpolska 1922-1939, p. 23″&lt;/ref&gt; The All-Polish Youth also actively campaigned for [[ghetto benches]], segregated seating for Jewish students &lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;[[Joanna Beata Michlic]], ''Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present'', [[University of Nebraska Press]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-8032-3240-3}}, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern days ==
[[File:MW na Marszu Niepodległości 2015.jpg|thumb|All-Polish Youth on 2015 March of Independence]]

The modern incarnation of the All-Polish Youth was founded in [[Poznań]] in 1989, on the initiative of [[Roman Giertych]], the former leader of the [[League of Polish Families]] (LPR). Continuing the tradition of its precursors, the organisation maintains its aim of raising youth with their ideology, and operates across all of Poland, working with high-school and university students. 

In 2006, the Polish Public Prosecutor's office launched an investigation after a video recording from a private party was leaked to the Polish press. It was considered that All-Polish Youth members including Leokadia Wiącek, a personal assistant of [[Maciej Giertych]] (member of the European Parliament), were seen fraternizing with [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] skinheads, listening to Neo-Nazi bands, and saluting the [[swastika]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/13375/ Warsaw Voice - LPR Ditches All-Polish Youth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejpress.org/article/12523 EJP | News | Eastern Europe | ‘All-Polish Youth’ Nazi movie generates controversy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331095251/http://www.ejpress.org/article/12523 |date=2009-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dziennik.pl/polityka/article13074/Nazistowskie_wybryki_Mlodziezy_Wszechpolskiej.html&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, Leokadia Wiącek was expelled from All-Polish Youth,&lt;ref&gt;http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1342,wid,8625569,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=17530&lt;/ref&gt; and the League of Polish Families cut ties with the group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/13375/ Warsaw Voice - LPR Ditches All-Polish Youth (20 Dec 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; As it was later determined, during the private party Leokodia Wącek was not a member of the organisation and the main Polish television channel [[Telewizja Polska]] apologized to All-Polish Youth for accusing them of neo-nazi connotations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj0-41Vvsl4 TVP Polish Television Evening News (02 Aug 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

All-Polish Youth have declared that it is only by making Poland a Catholic state that its future will be secured, and chairman Konrad Bonisławski has stated "We do not want to become like Holland with its free drugs and gay marriage. Since joining the European Union we have seen attempts to destroy our Catholic values."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/1522202/Ghetto-survivor-warns-of-Polish-fascism.html Daily Telegraph - Ghetto survivor warns of Polish 'fascism' (24 June 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

All-Polish Youth have gained considerable press coverage due to their staunch opposition of abortion and, particularly, homosexuality (which their website condemns as "unnatural behaviour" and describes [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]] marches as "militant homosexualism").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polish-youth.org/index.php?function=show_all&amp;no=85 All-Polish Youth website - Demonstration March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to (sometimes violent) clashes with [[pro-choice]] and [[LGBT social movements|gay rights demonstrators]].

All-Polish Youth have been widely condemned as [[homophobic]] by various organisations including [[Amnesty International]],&lt;ref name="amnestyusa.org"/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt; and even the [[United Nations]] (which, in their ''Universal Periodic Review'', describes All-Polish Youth as an "extremist homophobic grouping"),&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt; as well as a multitude of [[Gay Rights]] organisations such as [[OutRage!]] and the Polish [[Campaign Against Homophobia]]. In 2004, 2005, and 2006, All-Polish Youth members and sympathizers violently attacked people who were taking part in pro-gay demonstrations, throwing eggs, bottles and rocks at them,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4956604.stm BBC News Report, 28 April 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/02/14/poland-official-homophobia-threatens-human-rights Human Rights Watch (Scott Long) 14 Feb 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and were reported to have shouted "Send the fags to the hospital", "Perverts, get out of Kraków", "Let's gas the fags" and "We'll do to you what Hitler did to the Jews".&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt;

From 2012 onwards, the organisation has been heavily involved in playing a major role as part of the [[National Movement (Poland)|National Movement party]], a party which the organisation was one of the several co-founders.

[[File:Andreas hofer mit hut.jpg|thumb|Posthumous painting of Andreas Hofer]]
'''Andreas Hofer''' (November 22, 1767 – February 20, 1810) was a [[County of Tyrol|Tyrolean]] innkeeper and [[Droving|drover]], who in 1809 became the leader of the [[Tyrolean Rebellion]] against the revolutionary Napoleonic invasion during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]]. He was subsequently captured and executed.

Hofer is still today venerated as a [[folk hero]], freedom fighter and Austrian [[patriotism|patriot]].

==Life==
[[File:Andreas Hofer 01.jpg|thumb|left|''Sandhof'' in St. Leonhard where Hofer was born and lived]]
Andreas Hofer was born 1767 in [[St. Leonhard in Passeier]], in the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] crown land of Tyrol. His father was an innkeeper of the ''Sandhof'' inn and Andreas followed in his footsteps when he inherited the establishment. He also traded wine and horses in adjacent [[Northern Italy]] and learned the Italian language. He married Anna Ladurner. In 1791 he was elected to the Tyrolean [[Landtag]] assembly. In German he was known as a ''Wirt'' (innkeeper) and thus ever after ''Sandwirt''.

In the [[War of the Third Coalition]] against the French he became a sharpshooter and later a militia captain in the Austrian [[Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars|Imperial and Royal Army]]. After the Austrian defeat, Tyrol was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria (France's ally) according to the 1805 [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]. During the stern measures of Minister [[Maximilian von Montgelas]] and the forced recruitment into the [[Bavarian Army]], Hofer became a leader of the anti-Bavarian movement. In January 1809, he was part of a delegation to [[Vienna]] to ask Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I of Austria]] for support for a possible uprising. The Emperor gave his assurances and the delegation returned home.

Hofer begun to secretly organize insurrection, visiting villagers and holding councils of war in local inns. Reputedly he was so much on the move that he signed his messages "Andreas Hofer, from where I am" and letters to him were addressed to "wherever he may be". At the same time other leaders organized their own forces elsewhere in the Alps. Hofer became a leader of a militia contingent in the [[Passeier Valley]].

===Armed rebellion begins===
[[File:Combat du Bergisel.jpg|thumb|On the eve of the Battle of Bergisel, 1900 painting by [[Franz Defregger]]]]
The Tyrolean Rebellion began on 9 April 1809 in [[Innsbruck]]. The previous night, organizers dumped sacks of sawdust into the River [[Inn (river)|Inn]] as a sign to start the rebellion; floating through the town and down the Inn Valley, it alerted the rebels. Church bells summoned men to fight with muskets and farmyard implements. They soon overran smaller Bavarian garrisons and surprised a column of French infantry that was passing through the area.

On April 11 Tyrolean militia defeated a Bavarian force in [[Sterzing]] which led to the occupation of Innsbruck before noon. Though French forces came across the [[Brenner Pass]] as a relief and a united French-Bavarian contingent counterattacked the next night, the Tyroleans fought them in the First [[Battles of Bergisel|Battle of Bergisel]] until Hofer and his allies won on the morning of the 13th. While Austrian forces under General [[Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles]] moved into the Tyrolean capital and installed a provisional government led by [[Joseph Hormayr, Baron zu Hortenburg|Joseph Hormayr]], Hofer advanced south, taking [[Bolzano|Bozen]] and [[Trento|Trent]].

Hopes of a successful rebellion waned when Napoleon defeated the Austrian forces of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles of Austria]] in a series of battles of [[Battle of Teugen-Hausen|Teugen-Hausen]], [[Battle of Abensberg|Abensberg]], [[Battle of Eckmühl|Eckmühl]], and [[Battle of Ratisbon|Ratisbon]], whereafter the Austrian troops withdrew from Tyrol and Hofer had to pull back to the mountains. The French Marshal [[François Joseph Lefebvre]] took charge of the Tyrolean theatre, and Bavarian and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]] forces under the command of [[Karl Philipp von Wrede]] on May 13 defeated the Austrians in a bloody skirmish at [[Wörgl]]. The Bavarians re-occupied Innsbruck on May 19. However, when their French allies left, the rebellion flared up again.

===Hofer takes command===
[[File:Tiroler Landsturm 1809.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting Hofer and his troops liberating his people from foreign occupation]]
Hofer became the effective commander-in-chief of the Tyrolean rebels, with the support of other leaders such as [[Josef Speckbacher]] and Father [[Joachim Haspinger]]. He commanded a force of Tyroleans approximately 20,000 strong, together with a couple of hundred Austrian soldiers who had joined them after the retreat of the Austrian army.

In the second Battle of Bergisel, from May 25 to May 29 1809, Hofer's troops again defeated the Bavarians, driving them out of the country and retaking Innsbruck on May 30. On May 29 Hofer received a letter from Emperor Francis in which he promised not to sign any peace treaty that would include giving up Tyrol. An Austrian [[intendant]] came to rule Tyrol and Hofer returned to his home. However, Napoleon again defeated Austrian troops in the [[Battle of Wagram]] on July 6. The [[Armistice of Znaim]] ceded Tyrol to Bavaria again. Napoleon sent 40,000 French and Bavarian troops to take over Tyrol and they re-occupied Innsbruck.

After little hesitation, Hofer joined battle again. The French offered a reward for his head. On August 13–14, in the third Battle of Bergisel, Hofer's Tyroleans defeated the French troops of Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre in a 12-hour battle after a downhill charge. The Tyroleans retook Innsbruck.

[[File:Bataille de Sterzing.jpg|thumb|Tyroleans defeated the Bavarian troops at Battle of Sterzing]]
Hofer declared himself Imperial Commandant of the Tyrol in the absence of the ruler and for two months ruled the land from [[Hofburg]] in the name of the Emperor of Austria. He announced new laws and taxes and minted his own coins. He also sent two men to Britain to ask for assistance. On September 29 he received a medal from the emperor and another promise that Austria would not abandon Tyrol.

Hofer's hopes were dashed on October 14 when the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] again ceded Tyrol to Bavaria. French and Bavarian troops advanced and Hofer retreated to the mountains. Promised [[amnesty]], Hofer and his followers laid down their weapons on November 8. Hofer retired to his home valley.

===Final attempt and capture===
[[File:Leopold Puellacher, Franz Raffl verrät das Versteck des Andreas Hofer, 1820.jpg|thumb|Franz Raffl reveals the hideout of Andreas Hofer]]
On November 12, Hofer received false reports of Austrian victories and tried to summon his troops on November 15. This time he had little following and French troops defeated his forces. His subordinate commanders surrendered and urged him to escape over the mountains.

Hofer hid in a hut in the mountains in the Passeiertal and the French announced a reward of 1500 [[guilder]]s for his head. His neighbor Franz Raffl betrayed him and revealed his hiding place to the authorities. Hofer was captured by Italian troops on January 28, 1810 and was sent to [[Mantua]] in chains to face a [[court-martial]]. (Raffl died impoverished in [[Bavaria]] twenty years later.)

[[Image:20 02 1810-die-erschiessung-von-andreas-hofer-in-mantua 1.jpg|thumb|Hofer's execution in Mantua]]

===Court martial and execution===
Officers holding the court martial disagreed on the exact sentence until they received a message from Milan. It was supposedly from the Viceroy, transmitting Napoleon's order to "give him a fair trial and then shoot him." Later Napoleon claimed to [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Prince Metternich]] that Hofer was [[execution (legal)|executed]] against his wishes.

Andreas Hofer was [[Execution by firing squad|executed by a firing squad]] on February 20, 1810. He refused a [[blindfold]] or to kneel, and gave money to a corporal in charge, telling him to "shoot straight". He gave the order to fire himself. &lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Pocock]]. Stopping Napoleon: War and Intrigue in the Mediterranean (Kindle Locations 2357-2359). Thistle Publishing. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Hofer became a [[martyr]] in Germany and Austria and a rallying symbol against the power of Napoleon.

==Legacy and monuments==
[[Image:Bergisel-0001.JPG|thumb|Andreas Hofer monument at Bergisel near Innsbruck]]
In 1818, his family was given a [[patent of nobility]] by the [[emperor of Austria]] (he and Anna had 7 children, at least two of whom emigrated to America). In 1823, Hofer's remains were moved from Mantua to Innsbruck, and in 1834, his tomb was decorated with a marble statue. In 1893, a [[bronze statue]] of Hofer was erected in Bergisel ([[Innsbruck]]). A large painting depicting his arrest hangs in the Palace of Maria Theresa in Innsbruck, and there is an annual open-air play in [[Meran]] based on his life. In Meran there is also a monumental statue of him opposite the train station at the beginning of the Via Andreas Hofer, which was erected by Tyrolean nationalists in 1915.

The song ''[[Zu Mantua in Banden]]'' (today the anthem of the [[State of Tyrol]]) tells the story of his tragic fate and execution.
His most famous quote: ''I will not trade my life for a lie''

The 1929 German silent film ''[[Andreas Hofer (film)|Andreas Hofer]]'' is a biopic of his life. Hofer was played by [[Fritz Greiner]].

She subsequently embarked on a career as a law clerk before rising to prominence in the 1990s as an outspoken critic of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]].

==Early life==
[[File:Ann Coulter HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Coulter as a senior in high school, 1980]]
Ann Hart Coulter was born on December 8, 1961, in New York City, to John Vincent Coulter (1926–2008), an FBI agent of Irish–German heritage,&lt;ref name=hufpost1&gt;Smolenyak, Megan. {{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-smolenyak-smolenyak/ann-coulters-immigrant-an_b_8332212.html |title=Ann Coulter's Immigrant Ancestors |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a native of [[Albany, New York]]; and Nell Husbands Coulter (née Martin; 1928–2009), a native of [[Paducah, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2008-01-09.html|title=Ann Coulter – January 9, 2008 – John Vincent Coulter|publisher=anncoulter.com}}&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.humanevents.com/2009/04/22/nell-husbands-martin-coulter/ "Nell Husbands Nartin CoulterLL"]. humanevents.com. April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Her family later moved to [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], where Coulter and her two older brothers, James and John, were raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holson|first1=Laura M.|title=Outflanked on Right, Coulter Seeks New Image|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/fashion/10coulter.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=January 27, 2018|date=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was brought up in a conservative household in Connecticut by Republican parents, with a father who idolized [[Joseph McCarthy]]. Coulter says that she has identified as a conservative since [[kindergarten]]. To prepare for arguments, she read books like ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'' by [[Barry Goldwater]].&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/ann-coulter-is-a-human-being|title=Ann Coulter Is a Human Being|website=Broadly|language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 14, Coulter visited her older brother in New York City, where he attended law school. While he was in class, he had his little sister read books by [[Milton Friedman]] and [[William E. Simon]]. When he got home from class, he quizzed Coulter. As a reward, he and his friends took her out to bars on the Upper East Side. Reading Republican books made Coulter dream about working as a writer.&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com" /&gt; She graduated from [[New Canaan High School]] in 1980. Coulter's age was disputed in 2002, while she was arguing that she was not yet 40, yet ''[[The Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Lloyd Grove]] cited that she provided a birthdate of December 8, 1961, when registering to vote in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], prior to the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 Presidential election]]. Meanwhile, a driver's license issued several years later purportedly listed her birthdate as December 8, 1963. Coulter will not confirm either date, citing privacy concerns.&lt;ref name="Grove_Lloyd"&gt;{{cite news|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|title=Mystery of the Ages|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 6, 2002|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/09/06/the-reliable-source/dc20d57b-0508-45e7-a7f1-7a93d293f840/|access-date=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She handled crime and immigration issues for Senator [[Spencer Abraham]] of [[Michigan]] and helped craft legislation designed to expedite the [[deportation]] of aliens convicted of [[felony|felonies]].&lt;ref name=Daley1999&gt;Daley, David.

===Books===
[[File:Ann Coulter2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ann Coulter at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]]]]

Coulter is the author of twelve books, many of which have appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], with a combined 3 million copies sold {{as of|2009|May|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="depasquale"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/LisaDePasquale/2009/05/06/being_ann|title=Being Ann|last=De Pasquale|first=Lisa|date=May 6, 2009|publisher=[[Townhall.com]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter's first book, ''[[High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton]]'', was published by [[Regnery Publishing]] in 1998 and made the New York Times Bestseller list.&lt;ref name="Howard Kurtz" /&gt; It details Coulter's case for the [[Clinton impeachment|impeachment]] of [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]].

Her second book, ''[[Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right]]'', published by [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Forum]] in 2002, reached the number one spot on ''The New York Times'' non-fiction best seller list.&lt;ref name="slander_bestseller"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/ann_coulter/index.html|title=Ann Coulter|date=March 10, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 21, 2009 | first=Ian | last=Austen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Slander'', Coulter argues that President [[George W. Bush]] was given unfair negative media coverage. The factual accuracy of ''Slander'' was called into question by then-[[comedian]] and author, later Democratic [[U.S. Senator]] from [[Minnesota]], [[Al Franken]]; he also accused her of citing passages out of context.&lt;ref name="frankenbook"&gt;{{cite book|author = Franken, Al|title=Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right|publisher = Dutton Books|year = 2003|isbn = 0-525-94764-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others investigated these charges, and also raised questions about the book's accuracy and presentation of facts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20020713.html "Throwing the book at her"], ''Spinsanity''.

In her third book, ''[[Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism]]'', also published by Crown Forum, she reexamines the 60-year history of the [[Cold War]]—including the career of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joseph McCarthy]], the [[Whittaker Chambers]]-[[Alger Hiss]] affair, and [[Ronald Reagan]]'s challenge to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to "[[tear down this wall]]"—and argues that liberals were wrong in their Cold War political analyses and policy decisions, and that McCarthy was correct about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1200/article_detail.asp |title=Tailgunner Ann |author=William F.

On June 7, 2011, [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Forum]] published her eighth book ''[[Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America]]''. Coulter said she based this book heavily on the work of [[France|French]] [[social psychologist]] [[Gustave Le Bon]], who wrote on mass psychology, and in it she argues that liberals have mob-like characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;"Why liberals behave the way they do" by Ann Coulter, ''The Dailer Caller'', August 15, 2012, [http://dailycaller.com/2012/08/15/why-liberals-behave-the-way-they-do/ Retrieved 2012-08-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ninth book, published September 25, 2012, is ''[[Mugged: Racial Demagoguery from the Seventies to Obama]]''.

===Columns===
In the late 1990s, Coulter's weekly (biweekly from 1999–2000) [[Print syndication|syndicated]] column for [[Universal Press Syndicate]] began appearing. Her column is featured on six conservative websites: ''[[Human Events|Human Events Online]]'', [[WorldNetDaily]], [[Townhall.com]], [[VDARE]], ''[[FrontPage Magazine]]'', ''[[Jewish World Review]]'' and her own website. Her syndicator says, "Ann's client newspapers stick with her because she has a loyal fan base of conservative readers who look forward to reading her columns in their local newspapers".&lt;ref name="EP_mitchell-astor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.neilrogers.com/news/articles/2006061922.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714162642/http://www.neilrogers.com/news/articles/2006061922.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |title=Newspaper Clients, and Syndicate, Stick With Coulter |date=June 16, 2006 |work=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |access-date=June 28, 2009 |author1=Astor, Dave |author2=Mitchell, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Coulter worked as a regular [[columnist]] for ''[[George (magazine)|George]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="arm candy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tribute-to-john"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uexpress.com/anncoulter/index.html?uc_full_date=19990728|title=A Republican Tribute to John|last=Coulter|first=Ann|date=July 28, 1999|publisher=uexpress.com|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulter also wrote exclusive weekly columns between 1998 and 2003 and with occasional columns thereafter for the conservative magazine ''[[Human Events]]''. In her columns for the magazine, she discusses judicial rulings, [[Constitution]]al issues, and legal matters affecting Congress and the [[executive branch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/author/ann-coulter/|title=Ann Coulter's Articles |work=Human Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, as a contributing editor and syndicated columnist for ''[[National Review Online]]'' (NRO), Coulter was asked by editors to make changes to a piece written after the [[September 11 attacks]]. On the national television show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', Coulter accused ''NRO'' of [[censorship]] and said that she was paid $5 per article. NRO dropped her column and terminated her editorship. [[Jonah Goldberg]], editor-at-large of ''NRO'', said, "We did not 'fire' Ann for what she wrote... we ended the relationship because she behaved with a total lack of professionalism, friendship, and loyalty [concerning the editing disagreement]."&lt;ref name="goldbergjonah"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/220676/laffaire-coulter/jonah-goldberg |title=L'Affaire Coulter |last=Goldberg |first=Jonah |date=October 2, 2001 |work=[[National Review]] |access-date=November 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901162828/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/220676/laffaire-coulter/jonah-goldberg |archivedate=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter contracted with ''[[USA Today]]'' to cover the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]]. She wrote one article that began, "Here at the Spawn of [[Satan]] convention in [[Boston]]&amp;nbsp;..." and referred to some unspecified female attendees as "[[corn-fed (disambiguation)|corn-fed]], no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, [[hirsutism|hirsute]], somewhat fragrant [[hippie]] chick pie wagons". The newspaper declined to print the article citing an editing dispute over "basic weaknesses in clarity and readability that we found unacceptable". An explanatory article by the paper went on to say "Coulter told the online edition of ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' magazine that {{'}}''USA Today'' doesn't like my "tone", humor, sarcasm, etc., which raises the intriguing question of why they hired me to write for them.'" ''USA Today'' replaced Coulter with [[Jonah Goldberg]], and Coulter published it instead on her website.&lt;ref name="speakerscage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=39644|title=Put the speakers in a cage|last=Coulter|first=Ann|date=July 26, 2004|work=[[World Net Daily]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatodaydrops"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/26/politics/main631949.shtml|title=USA Today Drops Ann Coulter|last=Collins|first=Dan|date=July 26, 2004|publisher=[[CBS News]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatodaydrops2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/2004-07-26-coulter-column_x.htm|title=Coulter column canceled after editing dispute|last=Memmott|first=Mark|date=July 26, 2004|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' dropped Coulter's syndicated column, citing reader complaints: "Many readers find her shrill, bombastic, and mean-spirited. And those are the words used by readers who identified themselves as conservatives".&lt;ref name="AZDailyStar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com/dailystar/opinion/90500.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925074100/http://www.dailystar.com/dailystar/opinion/90500.php |archivedate=September 25, 2005 |title=Opinion pages get a makeover|last=Stoeffler|first=David|date=August 28, 2005|publisher=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|access-date=July 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, some newspapers replaced Coulter's column with those of other conservative columnists following the publication of her fourth book, ''[[Godless: The Church of Liberalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/another-newspaper-decides-to-drop-ann-coulter-s-column/|title=Another Newspaper Decides to Drop Ann Coulter's Column |website=editorandpublisher.com|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''[[The Augusta Chronicle]]'' dropped her column, newspaper editor Michael Ryan explained: "it came to the point where she was the issue rather than what she was writing about".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002878146 |title=Augusta Editor Explains Why He Dropped Coulter Column |date=July 24, 2006 |work=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |access-date=July 26, 2006 |author1=Astor, Dave |author2=Mitchell, Greg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404200542/http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002878146 |archivedate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan also stated that "pulling Ann Coulter's column hurts; she's one of the clearest thinkers around".

Coulter made her first national media appearance in 1996 after she was hired by the then-fledgling network [[MSNBC]] as a legal correspondent.

She then mocked "the message of Jesus... according to liberals", summarizing it as "something along the lines of 'be nice to people{{'"}}, which, in turn, she said "is, in fact, one of the incidental tenets of Christianity."&lt;ref name="Passion-of-the-Liberal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coulter|first=Ann|title=The Passion of the Liberal|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2004/03/04/the_passion_of_the_liberal|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=Townhall.com|date=March 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hate crimes
Coulter opposes [[hate crime laws]], calling them "unconstitutional". She also stated that "Hate-crime provisions seem vaguely directed at capturing a sense of cold-bloodedness, but the law can do that without elevating some victims over others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter011000.asp|title=Ann Coulter|website=www.jewishworldreview.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===
Coulter has criticized former president [[George W. Bush]]'s immigration proposals, saying they led to "amnesty". In a 2007 column, she claimed that the current immigration system was set up to deliberately reduce the percentage of whites in the population. In it, she said:&lt;ref name="roachmotel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=188 |title=Bush's America: Roach Motel |last=Coulter |first=Ann |date=June 6, 2007 |publisher=anncoulter.com |access-date=April 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102051234/http://anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=188 |archivedate=January 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In 1960, whites were 90 percent of the country. The Census Bureau recently estimated that whites already account for less than two-thirds of the population and will be a minority by 2050. Other estimates put that day much sooner.

One may assume the new majority will not be such compassionate overlords as the white majority has been. If this sort of drastic change were legally imposed on any group other than white Americans, it would be called genocide. Yet whites are called racists merely for mentioning the fact that current immigration law is intentionally designed to reduce their percentage in the population.}}

Coulter strongly opposes the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2007-06-06.html|title=June 6, 2007 - BUSH'S AMERICA: ROACH MOTEL|website=www.anncoulter.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding illegal immigration, she strongly opposed [[amnesty]] for [[undocumented immigration|undocumented immigrants]], and at the 2013 CPAC said she has now become "a single-issue voter against amnesty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ann Coulter Becomes a Single Issue Voter|url=http://barelyablog.com/ann-coulter-becomes-a-single-issue-voter/|access-date=January 31, 2013|publisher=barelyablog.com|date=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, during the controversy caused by the [[Trump administration family separation policy]], Coulter dismissed immigrant children as "child actors weeping and crying" and urged Trump not to "fall for it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thomsen |first1=Jacqueline |title=Ann Coulter calls immigrant children 'child actors' |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/392774-ann-coulter-calls-immigrant-children-child-actors |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;;LGBT conservatism

Since the 1990s, Coulter has had many acquaintances in the LGBT community. She considers herself "the [[Judy Garland]] of the Right". In the last few years,{{vague|date=August 2018}} she has attracted many LGBT fans, namely gay men and [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/queen-of-the-hill-the-worlds-best-hillary-impersonator-is-ready-for-2016|title=Queen of the Hill: The World's Best Hillary Impersonator Is Ready for 2016|website=Broadly|language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/video/shooting-guns-with-ann-coulter|title=Shooting Guns With Ann Coulter|website=Broadly|language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]], Coulter said, "I do want to point out one thing that has been driving me crazy with the media—how they keep describing [[Mitt Romney]]'s position as being pro-gays, and that's going to upset the right wingers", and "Well, you know, screw you! I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against." She added, "I don't know why all gays aren't Republican. I think we have the pro-gay positions, which is anti-crime and for tax cuts. Gays make a lot of money and they're victims of crime. No, they are! They should be with us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter under fire for anti-gay slur |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/|access-date=May 3, 2013|publisher=CNN|date= March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Coulter's 2007 book ''[[If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans]]'', in the chapter "Gays: No Gay Left Behind!", she argued that Republican policies were more pro-gay than Democratic policies. Coulter attended the 2010 HomoCon of [[GOProud]], where she commented that same-sex marriage "is not a civil right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ann Coulter Loves the Gays? Inside a Surprising Culture War|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/ann-coulter-goproud-speech-092710|access-date=January 31, 2013|newspaper=Esquire|date= September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2011, in a column, she described the national [[Log Cabin Republicans]] as "ridiculous" and "not conservative at all". She did however describe the Texas branch of Log Cabin Republicans, for whom she's been signing books for years, as "{{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} real conservatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2011-02-09.html|author=Ann Coulter |date= February 9, 2011 |title= Dear Mainstream Media Reporter Who Wasted My Time ...|website=anncoulter.com|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2011 [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]], during her question-and-answer segment, Coulter was asked about GOProud and the controversy over their inclusion at the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party's platform, saying, "The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don't think we should let them. I think they should be on our side", and "Gays are natural conservatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter Says 'Gays Are Natural Conservatives' – To Cheers From CPAC Crowd |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/02/coulter-says-gays-are-natural.html |access-date=January 31, 2013 |newspaper=[[Metro Weekly]] |date=February 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922134505/http://metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/02/coulter-says-gays-are-natural.html |archivedate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she joined advisory board for GOProud. On [[Logos]] [[The A-List: Dallas]] she told gay Republican Taylor Garrett that "The gays have got to be pro-life", and "As soon as they find the [[gay gene]], guess who the liberal yuppies are gonna start aborting?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ann Coulter On 'A List: Dallas': Liberals Would Abort Gay Babies (video) |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/08/ann-coulter-liberals-gay-abortions_n_1137277.html|access-date=January 31, 2013|newspaper=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|date= December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republican endorsements ===
Coulter initially supported [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush's presidency]], but later criticized its approach to immigration.

==Political activities and commentary==
{{update|date=March 2018}}
Ann Coulter has described herself as a "[[polemics|polemicist]]" who likes to "stir up the pot" and does not "pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do".&lt;ref name="polemicist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/coulter.pre.dea.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430010955/http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/coulter.pre.dea.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 30, 2006 |title=Conservative pundit Ann Coulter '84 to speak May 7 |last=Aloi |first=Daniel |date=April 17, 2006 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |access-date=September 27, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her political activities in the past have included advising a plaintiff suing President [[Bill Clinton]] as well as considering a run for Congress, she mostly serves as a political [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]], sometimes creating [[controversy]] ranging from rowdy uprisings at some of the colleges where she speaks to protracted discussions in the media. ''Time'' magazine's John Cloud once observed that Coulter "likes to shock reporters by wondering aloud whether America might be better off if women lost the right to vote".&lt;ref name="msright" /&gt; This was in reference to her statement that "it would be a much better country if women did not vote. That is simply a fact. In fact, in every presidential election since 1950—except [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] in '64—the Republican would have won, if only the men had voted."&lt;ref name="appmagic" /&gt; Similarly, in an October 2007 interview with the ''[[New York Observer]]'', Coulter said:&lt;ref name="Gurley_George"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gurley|first=George|title=Coulter Culture|url=http://www.observer.com/2007/coulter-culture|access-date=September 27, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Observer]]|date=October 2, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112214238/http://www.observer.com/2007/coulter-culture|archivedate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If we took away women's right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president. It's kind of a pipe dream, it's a personal fantasy of mine, but I don't think it's going to happen. And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly, at least single women.

It also makes the point, it is kind of embarrassing, the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame, that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it. I mean, you do see it's the party of women and 'We'll pay for health care and tuition and day care—and here, what else can we give you, soccer moms?'}}
In addition to questioning whether women's right to vote is a good thing, Coulter has also appeared on Fox News and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters (this was in 1999, and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plutocrats United: Campaign Money, the Supreme Court, and the Distortion of American Elections|last=Hasen|first=Richard L.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780300212457|location=New Haven, CT|page=66|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a viewpoint widely shared by members of the Republican Party.

===Paula Jones – Bill Clinton case===
Coulter first became a public figure shortly before becoming an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing [[Paula Jones]] in her [[sexual harassment]] suit against President Bill Clinton. Coulter's friend George Conway had been asked to assist Jones' attorneys, and shortly afterward Coulter, who wrote a column about the Paula Jones case for ''[[Human Events]]'', was also asked to help, and she began writing legal briefs for the case.

Coulter later stated that she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to [[legal settlement|settle]], if a favorable settlement could be negotiated.&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=conason /&gt; From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, Daphne. "[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1998/09/23/fhead.htm Jones would have been happy with an apology]". ''[[Irish Examiner]]''. September 23, 1998. Retrieved July 10, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812211212/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1998/09/23/fhead.htm |date=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would give the impression that Jones was merely interested in [[extortion|extorting]] money from the President.&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;

David Daley, who wrote the interview piece for ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' recounted what followed:

{{quote|Coulter played one particularly key role in keeping the Jones case alive. In ''Newsweek'' reporter Michael Isikoff's new book ''Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story'', Coulter is unmasked as the one who leaked word of Clinton's "distinguishing characteristic"—his reportedly bent penis that Jones said she could recognize and describe—to the news media. Her hope was to foster mistrust between the Clinton and Jones camps and forestall a settlement ... I thought if I leaked the distinguishing characteristic it would show bad faith in negotiations. [Clinton lawyer] Bob Bennett would think Jones had leaked it. Cammaratta would know he himself hadn't leaked it and would get mad at Bennett. It might stall negotiations enough for me to get through to [Jones adviser] Susan Carpenter-McMillan to tell her that I thought settling would hurt Paula, that this would ruin her reputation, and that there were other lawyers working for her. Then 36 hours later, she returned my phone call. I just wanted to help Paula. I really think Paula Jones is a hero. I don't think I could have taken the abuse she came under. She's this poor little country girl and she has the most powerful man she's ever met hitting on her sexually, then denying it and smearing her as president. And she never did anything tacky. It's not like she was going on TV or trying to make a buck out of it."&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;}}

In his book, Isikoff also reported Coulter as saying: "We were terrified that Jones would settle. It was contrary to our purpose of bringing down the President."&lt;ref name=conason&gt;Conason, Joe; Lyons, Gene. "[http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2000/03/04/willey/print.html Impeachment's little elves]". ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''. March 4, 2000.

{{quote|The only motive for leaking the distinguishing characteristic item that [Isikoff] gives in his book is my self-parodying remark that "it would humiliate the president" and that a settlement would foil our efforts to bring down the president ... I suppose you could take the position, as [Isikoff] does, that we were working for Jones because we thought Clinton was a lecherous, lying scumbag, but this argument gets a bit circular. You could also say that Juanita Broaddrick's secret motive in accusing Clinton of rape is that she hates Clinton because he raped her. The whole reason we didn't much like Clinton was that we could see he was the sort of man who would haul a low-level government employee like Paula to his hotel room, drop his pants, and say, "Kiss it." You know: Everything his defense said about him at the impeachment trial. It's not like we secretly disliked Clinton because of his administration's position on California's citrus cartels or something, and then set to work on some crazy scheme to destroy him using a pathological intern as our Mata Hari.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann (May 1999). "Spikey and me". [[George (magazine)|''George''.]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The case went to court after Jones broke with Coulter and her original legal team, and it was dismissed via [[summary judgment]]. The judge ruled that even if her allegations proved true, Jones did not show that she had suffered any damages, stating, "... plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal to submit to the governor's alleged advances. The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of [[quid pro quo]] sexual harassment." The ruling was [[appeal]]ed by Jones' lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones' dismissal of the appeal. By then, the Jones lawsuit had given way to the [[Lewinsky scandal|Monica Lewinsky sex scandal]].

In October 2000, Jones revealed that she would pose for nude pictures in an adult magazine, saying she wanted to use the money to pay taxes and support her grade-school-aged children, in particular saying, "I'm wanting to put them through college and maybe set up a college fund."&lt;ref name=larryking&gt;Jones, Paula.

Coulter wrote:

"Ann Coulter's use of this anti-gay slur is vile and unacceptable," said Neil G.

[[John McCain]], a Republican presidential candidate, called Coulter's comments "wildly inappropriate".&lt;ref name="CNN_edwards_faggot_comment" /&gt;

As the campaign waged on, she continued to insert her commentary regarding the candidates, both Democrats and Republicans. In a June 2007 interview, Coulter named [[Duncan Hunter]] as her choice for the 2008 Republican Presidential nomination, highlighting his views on immigration and specifically his anti-abortion credentials, saying "[t]his is a winning issue for us, protecting little babies".&lt;ref&gt;''Good Morning America'', ABC: [http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3312795 What's Wrong With The Republicans?] June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2008, Coulter began endorsing Governor [[Mitt Romney]] as her choice for the 2008 Republican nomination, saying he is "manifestly the best candidate" (contrasting Romney with Republican candidates [[John McCain]], [[Mike Huckabee]], and [[Rudy Giuliani]]).&lt;ref name="Coulter_endorses_Romney"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coulter |first=Ann |title=The Elephant in the Room |url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/article.cgi?article=230 |access-date=September 27, 2011 |publisher=AnnCoulter.com |date=January 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927112540/http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/article.cgi?article=230 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Coulter was critical of eventual Republican nominee [[John McCain]]. On the January 31, 2008, broadcast of ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]'', Coulter claimed that if McCain won the Republican nomination for president, she would support and campaign for [[Hillary Clinton]], stating, "[Clinton] is more conservative than McCain."&lt;ref name="Parker_Jennifer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker |first=Jennifer |title=Coulter: I Will Vote for Hillary Over McCain |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/02/coulter-i-will/ |access-date=September 27, 2011 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=February 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110092504/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/02/coulter-i-will/ |archivedate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding then-presidential-candidate [[Barack Obama]] in an April 2, 2008, column, she characterized his book ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'' as a "dimestore ''[[Mein Kampf]]''{{-"}}. Coulter writes, "He says the reason black people keep to themselves is that it's 'easier than spending all your time mad or trying to guess whatever it was that white folks were thinking about you.' Here's a little inside scoop about white people: We're not thinking about you. Especially [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPs]].

===2010 Canadian university tour===
[[File:Ann Coulter by Gage Skidmore 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ann Coulter at [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]] in February 2012]]

In March 2010, Coulter announced that she would be embarking on a speaking tour of three Canadian universities, The [[University of Western Ontario]], the [[University of Ottawa]] and the [[University of Calgary]]. The tour was organized by the [[International Free Press Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/783585--watch-your-mouth-ann-coulter-warned-for-canadian-tour?bn=1 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Watch your mouth, Ann Coulter warned for Canadian tour | first=Bruce | last=Cheadle | date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of Coulter's first speech at the University of Western Ontario, an e-mail to Coulter from François Houle, provost of the University of Ottawa, was leaked to the media. The e-mail warned that "promoting hatred against any identifiable group would not only be considered inappropriate, but could in fact lead to criminal charges." Coulter released a public statement alleging that by sending her the e-mail, Houle was promoting hatred against conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsmax.com/InsideCover/coulter-canada-provost-hate/2010/03/23/id/353652 |title=Coulter: Canadian U Provost Guilty of Hate Crimes |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=March 23, 2010 |access-date=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her speech at the University of Western Ontario, she told a Muslim student to "take a [[camel]]", in response to the student's question about previous comments by Coulter that Muslims should not be allowed on airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100324/OTT_Coulter_Rxn_100324/20100324/?hub=OttawaHome |title=Students divided over Coulter's cancelled speech |publisher=Ottawa.ctv.ca |access-date=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, the University of Ottawa made international news when liberal protesters conspired to prevent Coulter from speaking. The event was canceled in spite of a massive security presence; Alain Boucher of the [[Ottawa Police Service]] said there were ten officers visible at the scene, "plus other resources" nearby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/289589 Ottawa police say they didn't shut Coulter down]; March 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Boucher alleged that Coulter's security team decided to call off the event, saying, "We gave her options," including, he said, to "find a bigger venue." But "they opted to cancel ... It's not up to the Ottawa police to make that decision."&lt;ref name="Adventures_in_Ottawa"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Malley |first=Kady |title=Updated – Ann Coulter's Adventures in Ottawa: So, what happened last night? |url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/insidepolitics/2010/03/ann-coulters-adventures-in-ottawa-so-what-really-happened-last-night.html |access-date=July 2, 2010 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=March 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327123602/http://www.cbc.ca/politics/insidepolitics/2010/03/ann-coulters-adventures-in-ottawa-so-what-really-happened-last-night.html |archivedate=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boucher claimed there were no arrests.&lt;ref name="Ottawa_police"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wightman|first=Ken|title=Ottawa police say they didn't shut Coulter down|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/289589|access-date=July 2, 2010|newspaper=Digital Journal|date=March 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100612031208/http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/289589| archivedate= June 12, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; CTV News reported, "It was a disaster in terms of just organization, which is probably one of the reasons why it was cancelled", citing the small number of students tasked with confirming who had signed up to attend Coulter's talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20100324/coulter_cancellation_100324/20100324?hub=TopStoriesV2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325223402/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20100324/coulter_cancellation_100324/20100324?hub=TopStoriesV2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 25, 2010 |title=Coulter protesters attack free speech: Levant – CTV News |publisher=ctv.ca |access-date=March 27, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments on Islam, Arabs, and terrorism===
On September 14, 2001, three days after the [[September 11 attacks]] (in which her friend [[Barbara Olson]] had been killed), Coulter wrote in her column:
{{quote|Airports scrupulously apply the same laughably ineffective airport harassment to Suzy Chapstick as to Muslim hijackers. It is preposterous to assume every passenger is a potential crazed homicidal maniac. We know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are the ones cheering and dancing right now. We should invade ''their'' countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/coulter/coulter091301.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010914225811/http://www.nationalreview.com/coulter/coulter091301.shtml |archivedate=September 14, 2001 |title=This Is War |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=September 14, 2001 |access-date=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This comment resulted in Coulter's being fired as a columnist by the ''National Review'', which she subsequently referred to as "squeamish girly-boys".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rough sailing for the new darling on the racial right. (2002). ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education,'' (34), 44. Via ProQuest.&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to this comment, Ibrahim Hooper of the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] remarked in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' that before September 11, Coulter "would have faced swift repudiation from her colleagues", but "now it's accepted as legitimate commentary".&lt;ref&gt;Jim Ritter, "Muslims see a growing media bias", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', September 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

One day after the attacks (when death toll estimates were higher than later), Coulter asserted that only Muslims could have been behind the attacks:
{{quote|Not all Muslims may be terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims—at least all terrorists capable of assembling a murderous plot against America that leaves 7,000 people dead in under two hours.&lt;ref name="Future widows"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092801.asp |author=Coulter, Ann |title= Future widows of America: Write your congressman |work=Jewish World Review |access-date=April 16, 2007 |date=September 28, 2001| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070416152942/http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092801.asp| archivedate=April 16, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Coulter was highly critical in 2002 of the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and especially its then-secretary [[Norman Mineta]]. Her many criticisms include their refusal to use [[racial profiling]] as a component of airport screening.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann. "[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter022802.asp Mineta's Bataan death march]", ''Jewish World Review''. February 28, 2002. Retrieved July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After a group of Muslims was expelled from a [[US Airways]] flight when other passengers expressed concern, sparking a call for Muslims to boycott the airline because of the [[Flying Imams controversy|ejection from a flight of six imams]], Coulter wrote:
{{quote|If only we could get Muslims to boycott all airlines, we could dispense with airport security altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=158 |title=What can I do to make your flight more uncomfortable? |author=Coulter, Ann |date=November 22, 2006 |access-date=April 17, 2007 |publisher=AnnCoulter.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326071242/http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=158 |archivedate=March 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Coulter also cited the 2002 Senate testimony of FBI whistleblower [[Coleen Rowley]], who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors for refusing to authorize a [[search warrant]] for 9-11 conspirator [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They knew that he was a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the [[List of intelligence agencies of France|French Intelligence Service]] had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that [[probable cause]] existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for [[Osama bin Laden]] she asserted "any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'" so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that {{"'}}probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England". Coulter says the poll was "by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''", actually it was by Sunrise, an "[[British Asian|Asian]]" (therefore an Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because "FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling", they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted. "The FBI allowed thousands of Americans to be slaughtered on the altar of [[political correctness]]. What more do liberals want?"&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann.

Coulter wrote in another column that she had reviewed the [[civil rights]] lawsuits against certain airlines to determine which of them had subjected Arabs to the most "egregious discrimination" so that she could fly only that airline. She also said that the airline should be bragging instead of denying any of the charges of discrimination brought against them.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann.

In a May 2007 article looking back at the life of then recently deceased evangelical Reverend [[Jerry Falwell]], Coulter commented on his (later retracted) statement after the 9/11 attacks that "the [[paganism|pagans]], and the [[abortion]]ists, and the [[feminist]]s, and the [[Homosexuality|gays]] and the [[lesbian]]s who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the [[ACLU]], [[People For the American Way]], all of them who have tried to secularize America ... helped this happen."

On October 22, 2012, following a presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Coulter published the following tweet from her official Twitter account: "I highly approve of Romney's decision to be kind and gentle to the retard", drawing stiff criticism for her use of a word which some find offensive to describe the president of the United States. The [[Special Olympics]] condemned Coulter in a tweet shortly after Coulter's.&lt;ref&gt;Grinberg, Emanuella.

After the election, in which [[Barack Obama]] won, Ann Coulter wrote a column titled "Romney Was Not the Problem". In it she argued against the idea that Mitt Romney lost because he failed to get his message across. She also said that Mitt Romney lost because he was running against an incumbent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2012-11-21.html|title=Ann Coulter: Romney Was Not the Problem|author=Ann Coulter|date=November 22, 2012|access-date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 CPAC Conference===
In March 2013, Coulter was one of the keynote speakers at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], where she made references to New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]]'s weight ("CPAC had to cut back on its speakers this year about 300 pounds") and progressive activist [[Sandra Fluke]]'s hairdo. (Coulter quipped that Fluke didn't need birth control pills because "that haircut is birth control enough".) Coulter advocated against a path to citizenship for [[undocumented immigrants]] because such new citizens would never vote for Republican candidates: "If amnesty goes through, America becomes California and no Republican will ever win another election."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ann-coulter-blasts-chris-christie-says-hes-off-my-list-for-2016-in-fiery-cpac-speech/|title=Ann Coulter Blasts Chris Christie, Says He's 'Off My List' For 2016 In Fiery CPAC Speech|author=Garrett Quinn|date=March 16, 2013|website=Mediaite|access-date= May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost.130316"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huff.to/16AsRy4|title=Ann Coulter CPAC: Pundit Tells Chris Christie Weight Joke, Calls Bill Clinton 'Forcible Rapist' |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt;|date=March 16, 2013|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Anti-semitism accusations ===
Coulter was accused of [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] in an October 8, 2007, interview with [[Donny Deutsch]] on ''[[The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch|The Big Idea]]''. During the interview, Coulter stated that the United States is a Christian nation, and said that she wants "Jews to be perfected, as they say" (referring to them being converted to Christianity).&lt;ref name="perfected_jews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter: We Want Jews To Be "Perfected"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/11/national/main3358373.shtml|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch, a practicing Jew, implied that this was an anti-semitic remark, but Coulter said she didn't consider it to be a hateful comment.&lt;ref name="Perfected_Jews_FOX"&gt;{{cite news|title=Columnist Ann Coulter Shocks Cable TV Show, Declaring 'Jews Need to be Perfected by Becoming Christians'|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,301216,00.html|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=October 11, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007220454/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,301216,00.html|archivedate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsch_response"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter draws fire over remarks about Jews|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21257498/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/coulter-draws-fire-over-remarks-about-jews/|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulter's comments on the show were condemned by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[American Jewish Committee]] and [[Bradley Burston]],&lt;ref&gt;Burston, B.

=== Plagiarism accusations ===
In October 2001, Coulter was accused of plagiarism in her 1998 book ''High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' by Michael Chapman, a columnist for the journal ''Human Events'' who claims that passages were taken from a supplement he wrote for the journal in 1997 titled "A Case for Impeachment".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

On the July 5, 2006, episode of ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' on [[MSNBC]], guest John Barrie, the CEO of iParadigms, offered his professional opinion that Coulter plagiarized in her book ''Godless'' as well as in her columns over the previous year.&lt;ref name="Dietz"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietz|first=Rob|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2006/07/06/olbermann-hosted-plagiarism-expert-to-spell-out/136106|title=Olbermann hosted plagiarism expert to spell out allegations against Coulter|work=Media Matters for America|date=July 6, 2006|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrie ran "Godless" through iThenticate, his company's machine which is able to scan works and compare them to existing texts.

[[File:WinonaSavingsBankVault.JPG|thumb|300px|This large 24-bolt [[Diebold]] vault door at the Winona National Bank was built in the early 1900s. On the right is the back side of the open door. To the right of the door's center are two linked boxes for the combination mechanisms and to the left is a four movement [[time lock]].  This door has a four-point pressure system (note the two pressure system [[wikt:stanchion|stanchions]] left of the door opening) capable of exerting 1/3 of the door's weight in pressure. Since this door weighs 22.5 tons (45,000 Lbs.) its pressure system is capable of applying 7.5 tons (15,000 Lbs.) of pressure.]]
A '''bank vault''' is a secure space where money, valuables, records, and documents are stored. It is intended to protect their contents from theft, unauthorized use, fire, natural disasters, and other threats, much like a [[safe]]. Unlike safes, vaults are an integral part of the building within which they are built, using armored walls and a tightly fashioned door closed with a complex [[Lock (security device)|lock]].

Historically, strongrooms were built in the [[basement]] of a bank where the ceilings were [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]], hence the name. Modern bank vaults typically contain many [[safe deposit box]]es, as well as places for teller cash drawers, and other valuable assets of the bank or its customers. They are also common in other buildings where valuables are kept such as post offices, grand hotels, rare book libraries and certain government ministries.

Vault technology developed in a type of arms race with bank robbers. As [[burglar]]s came up with new ways to break into vaults, vault makers found new ways to foil them. Modern vaults may be armed with a wide array of alarms and anti-theft devices. Some nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century vaults were built so well that today they are difficult to destroy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/local_news/demolition-crew-cracks-the-old-u-s-bank-vault/article_40b8808c-c42c-11e4-8929-a3b126a0fa7a.html&lt;/ref&gt; These older vaults were typically made with [[Reinforced concrete|steel-reinforced concrete]]. The walls were usually at least 1&amp;nbsp;ft (0.3 m) thick, and the door itself was typically 3.5&amp;nbsp;ft (1.1 m) thick. Total weight ran into the hundreds of tons (see the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland]]). Today vaults are made with thinner, lighter materials that, while still secure, are easier to dismantle than their earlier counterparts.

==History==
[[File:Bank vault 1901.jpg|thumb|left|200px|J&amp;J Taylor Strongroom from 1901]]
[[File:Bank safe Lisbon October 2014-1a.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Emergency vault door and combination locks at the Portuguese National Bank Museum in Lisbon.  Vault door built by the York Safe and Lock Company, PA, USA.]]

The need for secure storage stretches far back in time. The earliest known locks were made by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]. [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] used a more sophisticated locking system, called [[warded lock]]s. Warded locks had special notches and grooves that made picking them more difficult. Lock technology advanced independently in ancient [[India]], [[Ancient Russia|Russia]], and [[History of China#Ancient China|China]], where the [[combination lock]] is thought to have originated. In the United States, most banks relied on small iron [[safe]]s fitted with a key lock up until the middle of the nineteenth century. After the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] of 1849, unsuccessful [[Prospecting|prospector]]s turned to robbing banks. The prospectors would often break into the bank using a pickax and hammer. The safe was usually small enough that the thief could get it out a window, and take it to a secluded spot to break it open.

Banks demanded more protection and safe makers responded by designing larger, heavier safes. Safes with a key lock were still vulnerable through the key hole, and bank robbers soon learned to blast off the door by pouring explosives in this opening. In 1861, inventor [[Linus Yale Jr.]] introduced the modern combination lock. Bankers quickly adopted [[Yale (company)|Yale]]'s lock for their safes, but bank robbers came up with several ways to get past the new invention. It was possible to use force to punch the combination lock through the door. Other experienced burglars learned to drill holes into the lock case and use mirrors to view the slots in the combination wheels inside the mechanism. A more direct approach was to simply kidnap the bank manager and force him to reveal the combination.

After the inventions of the combination lock, James Sargent—an employee of Yale—developed the "theft proof lock." This was a combination lock that worked on a timer. The vault or safe door could only be opened after a set number of hours had passed, thus a kidnapped bank employee could not open the lock in the middle of the night even under force. [[Time lock]]s became widespread at banks in the 1870s. This reduced the kidnappings, but set bank robbers to work again at prying or blasting open vaults. Thieves developed tools for forcing open a tiny crack between the vault door and frame. As the crack widened, the thieves levered the door open or poured in gunpowder and blasted it off. Vault makers responded with a series of stair-stepped grooves in the door frame so the door could not be levered open. But these grooves proved ideal for a new weapon: liquid [[nitroglycerin]]. Professional bank robbers learned to boil [[dynamite]] in a kettle of water and skim the nitroglycerin off the top. They could drip this volatile liquid into the door grooves and destroy the door. Vault makers subsequently redesigned their doors so they closed with a thick, smooth, tapered plug. The plug fit so tightly that there was no room for the nitroglycerin.

By the 1920s, most banks avoided using safes and instead turned to gigantic, heavy vaults with walls and doors several feet thick. These were meant to withstand not only robbers but also angry mobs and natural disasters. Despite the new security measures, these vaults were still vulnerable to yet another new invention, the [[cutting torch]]. Burning oxygen and [[acetylene]] gas at about {{convert|6000|°F|°C|-2}}, the torch could easily cut through steel. It was in use as early as 1907, but became widespread with World War I. Robbers used cutting torches in over 200 bank robberies in 1924 alone. Manufacturers learned to sandwich a copper alloy into vault doors. If heated, the high thermal conductivity of copper dissipates the heat to prevent melting or burning. After this design improvement, bank burglaries fell off and were far less common at the end of the 1920s than at the beginning of the decade.

Technology continues in the race with bank robbers, coming up with new devices such as [[heat sensor]]s, [[motion detector]]s, and alarms. Bank robbers have in turn developed even more technological tools to find ways around these systems. Although the number of bank robberies has been cut dramatically, they are still attempted.

Materials used in vaults and vault doors have changed as well. The earlier vaults had steel doors, but because these could easily be cut by torches, different materials were tried. Massive cast iron doors had more resistance to acetylene torches than steel. The modern preferred vault door material is the same concrete as used in the vault wall panels. It is usually clad in steel for cosmetic reasons.

==Design==
[[File:TIFF Image File0003.TIF|thumb|200px|Vault of a retail bank under demolition.]]
Bank vaults are built as custom orders. The vault is usually the first aspect of a new bank building to be designed and built. The manufacturing process begins with the design of the vault, and the rest of the bank is built around it. The vault manufacturer consults with the customer to determine factors such as the total vault size, desired shape, and location of the door. After the customer signs off on the design, the manufacturer configures the equipment to make the vault panels and door. The customer usually orders the vault to be delivered and installed. That is, the vault manufacturer not only makes the vault parts, but brings the parts to the construction site and puts them together.

Bank vaults are typically made with steel-reinforced concrete. This material was not substantially different from that used in construction work. It relied on its immense thickness for strength. An ordinary vault from the middle of the 20th century might have been 18 in (45.72&amp;nbsp;cm) thick and was quite heavy and difficult to remove or remodel around. Modern bank vaults are now typically made of modular concrete panels using a special proprietary blend of concrete and additives for extreme strength. The concrete has been engineered for maximum crush resistance. A panel of this material, though only 3 in (7.62&amp;nbsp;cm) thick, may be up to 10 times as strong as an 18 in-thick (45.72-cm) panel of regular formula concrete.

There are at least two public examples of vaults withstanding a nuclear blast.  The most famous is the Teikoku Bank in [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] whose two [[Mosler Safe Company]] vaults survived the atomic blast with all contents intact.  The bank manager wrote a congratulatory note to Mosler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters of Note: Your Products are Stronger than the Atomic Bomb | url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/09/safe.html |accessdate=16 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100919151038/http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/09/safe.html| archivedate= 19 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unbreakable: Hiroshima and the Mosler Safe Company | url= http://conelrad.blogspot.com/2010/08/unbreakable-hiroshima-and-mosler-safe.html |publisher=CONELRAD Adjacent |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second is a vault at the [[Nevada National Security Site]] (formerly the Nevada Test Site) in which an above ground Mosler vault was one of many structures specifically constructed to be exposed to an atomic blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Nuclear Family Vacation| url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122382/entry/2122387/ |publisher=Slate Magazine |accessdate=11 July 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050713012637/http://www.slate.com/id/2122382/entry/2122387/| archivedate= 13 July 2005 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slate's Well-Traveled: A Nuclear Family Vacation | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4755708 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=15 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing process==

===Panels===
[[File:Immeuble du Crédit Lyonnais (siège).jpg|240px|thumbnail|right|[[Fichet-Bauche|''Fichet Paris'']], Vault of [[Crédit Lyonnais]] ]]

The wall panels are molded first using a special [[reinforced concrete]] mix. In addition to the usual cement powder, stone, etc., additional materials such as metal shavings or abrasive materials may be added to resist drilling penetration of the slab. Unlike regular concrete used in construction, the concrete for bank vaults is so thick that it cannot be poured. The consistency of concrete is measured by its "[[Concrete Slump Test|slump]]". Vault concrete has zero slump. It also sets very quickly, curing in only six to 12 hours, instead of the three to four days needed for most concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Channel (UK) How Do They Do It? (Season 3 / Episode 7 / Part 2) Diebold Vault Construction (YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oefNi2iNFEo|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hercvlite Vault Panels | url=http://www.vaultstructures.com/hercvlite.php|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A network of reinforcing steel rods are manually placed into the damp mix.
*The molds are vibrated for several hours. The vibration settles the material and eliminates air pockets.
*The edges are smoothed with a trowel, and the concrete is allowed to harden.
*The panels are removed from the mold and placed on a truck for transport to the customer's construction site.

===Door===
The vault door is also molded of special concrete used to make the panels, but it can be made in several ways. The door mold differs from the panel molds because there is a hole for the lock and the door will be clad in stainless steel. Some manufacturers use the steel cladding as the mold and pour the concrete directly into it. Other manufacturers use a regular mold and screw the steel on after the panel is dry.

Round vault doors were popular in the early 20th century and are iconic images for a bank's high security.  They fell out of favor due to manufacturing complexities, maintenance issues (door sag due to weight) and cost, but a few examples are still available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vault Structure Inc. Round Vault Doors | url=http://www.vaultstructures.com/round.php|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VSI 360 Round Vault Door | url=http://fspa1.com/pdf/Round_Vault_Door.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day gate is a second door inside the main vault door frame used for limited vault protection while the main door is open.  It is often made of open metal mesh or glass and is intended to keep a casual visitor out rather than to provide true security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Installation Instructions for Overly GSA Class 5 Vault Door|url=http://www.overly.com/door/tech/docs/ins-gsaCL5.pdf|publisher=Overly Door Company|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lock===
A vault door, much like the smaller burglary safe door, is secured with numerous massive metal bolts (cylinders) extending from the door into the surrounding frame.  Holding those bolts in place is some sort of lock.  The lock is invariably mounted on the inside (behind) of the difficult to penetrate door and is usually very modest in size and strength, but very difficult to gain access to from the outside.  There are many types of lock mechanisms in use:
*A [[combination lock]] similar in principle to that of a padlock or safe door is very common.  This is usually a mechanical device but products incorporating both mechanical and electronic mechanisms are available, making certain safe cracking techniques very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaba-MAS X-09 and CDX-09 High Security Locks|url=http://www.kaba-mas.com/pdf/brochures/x_09.pdf|pages=8|format=PDF|date=Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*High security key locks are used in a few vault doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Untold Story of the World's Biggest Diamond Heist|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/magazine/17-04/ff_diamonds?currentPage=all|publisher=Wired Magazine|accessdate=3 December 2009|date=12 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091108121455/http://www.wired.com/politics/law/magazine/17-04/ff_diamonds?currentPage=all| archivedate= 8 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A dual control (dual custody) combination lock has two dials controlling two locking mechanisms for the door.  They are usually configured so that both locks must be dialed open at the same time for the door to be unlocked.  No single person is given both combinations, requiring two people to cooperate to open the door. Some doors may be configured so that either dial will unlock the door, trading off increased convenience for lessened security.
*A [[time lock]] is a clock that prevents the vault's door from opening until a specified number of hours have passed. This is still the "theft proof" lock system that Sargent invented in the late nineteenth century. Such locks are manufactured by only a few companies worldwide. The locking system is supplied to the vault manufacturer preassembled.
* Many [[safe-cracking]] techniques also apply to the locking mechanism of the vault door.  They may be complicated by the sheer thickness and strength of the door and panel.

===Installation===
*The finished vault panels, door, and lock assembly are transported to the bank construction site. The vault manufacturer's workers then place the panels enclosed in steel at the designated spots and weld them together. The vault manufacturer may also supply an alarm system, which is installed at the same time. While older vaults employed various weapons against burglars, such as blasts of steam or tear gas, modern vaults instead use technological countermeasures. They can be wired with a listening device that picks up unusual sounds, or observed with a [[CCTV|camera]]. An alarm is often present to alert local police if the door or lock is tampered with.

==US Resistance Standards==

[[Quality control]] for much of the world's vault industry is overseen by [[Underwriters Laboratories|Underwriters Laboratories, Inc.]] (UL), in Northbrook, Illinois. Until 1991, the United States government also regulated the vault industry. The government set minimum standards for the thickness of vault walls, but advances in concrete technology made thickness an arbitrary measure of strength. Thin panels of new materials were far stronger than the thicker, poured concrete walls. Now the effectiveness of the vault is measured by how well it performs against a mock break-in. Manufacturers also do their own testing designing a new product to make sure it is likely to succeed in UL trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UL 608 Burglary Resistant Vault Doors and Modular Panels | url=http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0608.html |publisher=Underwriter's Laboratories | accessdate=30 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key points include:
*It is based on using "common hand tools, picking tools, mechanical or portable electric tools, grinding points carbide drills, pressure applying devices or mechanisms, abrasive cutting wheels, power saws, coring tools, impact tools, fluxing rods, and oxy-fuel gas cutting torches". 
*A breach is a hole in the door or wall of at least 96 square inches (6 × 16 in (15.24 × 40.64&amp;nbsp;cm)) or breaking locking bolts to allow the door to open. 
*Considers only the time actually spent working (excludes setup, rests, etc.) 
*Does not cover attacks with a [[thermal lance]] or explosives. 
*UL-608 makes no claims as to the fire resistance of the vault. 
*Applies to the door and all sides.
*The lock, ventilation, alarms, etc. are covered by other UL standards.

==Byproducts/waste==

The manufacturing process itself has no unusual waste or byproducts, but getting rid of old bank vaults can be a problem. Newer, modular bank vaults can be moved if a bank closes or relocates. They can also be enlarged if the bank's needs change. Older bank vaults are quite difficult to demolish. If an old bank building is to be renovated for another use, in most cases a specialty contractor has to be called in to demolish the vault. A vault's demolition requires massive wrecking equipment and may take months of work at a large expense. At least one company in the United States refurbishes old vault doors that are then resold.

In some cases, the new owner of a former bank building will opt to use the vault. There are cases where, for example, a bank building was renovated into a pub, which then used the vault as a secure storeroom for its liquor supply.

==Future==

Bank vault technology changed rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s with the development of improved concrete material. Bank burglaries are also no longer the substantial problem they were in the late nineteenth century up through the 1930s, but vault makers continue to alter their products to counter new break-in methods.

An issue in the twenty-first century is the [[thermal lance]]. Burning iron rods in pure oxygen ignited by an oxyacetylene torch, it can produce temperatures of 6,600–8,000&amp;nbsp;°F (3,650–4,430&amp;nbsp;°C). The thermal lance user bores a series of small holes that can eventually be linked to form a gap. Vault manufacturers work closely with the banking industry and law enforcement in order to keep up with such advances in burglary.

The '''Polish Border Guard''' ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''Straż Graniczna'', also abbreviated as '''SG''') is a [[state security]] agency tasked with patrolling the [[Polish border]]. It existed in the [[Second Polish Republic|Second Republic]] era from 1928 to 1939 and was reestablished in the modern-day [[History of Poland (1989-present)|Third Republic]] in 1990, going into operation the following year. During the [[People's Republic of Poland|communist era]] lasting from 1945 to 1989, the role of the [[border guard]] was carried out by the Border Protection Troops (''Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza'').

== 1928-1939 ==
The Straż Graniczna was founded in 1928. During the times of the [[Second Polish Republic]], it was responsible for northern, western and southern border of Poland (with Germany, [[Free City of Gdańsk]], sea border, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Romania]]). Eastern border, often raided by military bands supported by [[Soviet Union]] was under the jurisdiction of a separate, military formation ([[Border Protection Corps]], ''Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza'' - KOP).

Responsibilities of Straż Graniczna included:
* prevention of illegal crossing of the land and sea border by people and goods ([[smuggling]])
* ensuring safety and [[public order]] in the border area
* combat any threats to [[national security]] in the border area

Border Guard was organized in a military style, with uniformed and armed agents. It was controlled by the Ministry of Treasury, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Ministry of Military Affairs. The highest level of organizational structure of the agency was Main Headquarters (''Komenda Glowna''), based in [[Warsaw]]. It was followed by Regional Inspectorates, Border Inspectorates, stations and posts. It carried out actions through patrols, manning border checkpoints, tracking, rouses and intelligence work. It had its own river and sea flotilla, intelligence academy, and the Main School of Border Guard (''Centralna Szkola Strazy Granicznej''), which was located firstly in [[Gora Kalwaria]] (until 1928), then in [[Rawa Ruska]]. The school had a department of training of guard dogs, also located in Rawa Ruska.

Each station of the agency was responsible for some 20 to 25 kilometers of the borderline. The stations oversaw posts of the first line and posts of the second line. In 1938, there were 129 stations of the Border Guard, 419 posts of the first line (these were located right along the border), and 212 posts of the second line (located in the interior of the country, right behind posts of the first line).

===Regional inspectorates in 1939===
* [[Mazovia]]n Regional Inspectorate - [[Ciechanów]],
* [[Pomerania]]n Regional Inspectorate - [[Bydgoszcz]],
* [[Greater Poland]] Regional Inspectorate - [[Poznań]],
* [[Silesia]]n Regional Inspectorate - [[Katowice]],
* Western [[Lesser Poland]] Regional Inspectorate - [[Kraków]],
* Eastern [[Lesser Poland]] Regional Inspectorate - [[Lwow]].
* Agency of the Customs Inspectorate of the [[Free City of Gdańsk]].

In late 1938 and early 1939, following changes of borders of some Eastern European countries, the Border Guard took over protection of the boundary with [[Lithuania]], while [[Border Defence Corps]] moved some of its units to the newly established border with [[Hungary]]. Furthermore, every station of the Border Guard was strengthened with a platoon of the Polish Army.

Members of Straż Graniczna, under General [[Walerian Czuma]], participated in the [[Second World War]], fighting in the [[Polish Army]] during the [[invasion of Poland]].

== 1945 - 1989 ==
During the period of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the role of the border guards was carried out by the military formation of [[Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza|Border Protection Troops]] (''Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza''), being a part of the [[Polish People's Army]] and reporting directly to the Ministry of Interior, formerly under the Ministry of National Defense (from 1945-1949 and again from 1965 to 1970 and 1972), just as its 2nd Republic predecessors were assigned.

==1990 - present==
Straż Graniczna has been reestablished in the Third Polish Republic as a civil, [[police]]-type service, with the act of 12 October 1990 and began operations on 16 May 1991. It considers itself the successor to the Second Polish Republic formations of the Straż Graniczna and Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza (plus the military heritage of the Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza of the People's Republic), and thus is one of the only police styled forces  to use military style ranks (the [[Government Protection Bureau]], [[Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego]] and the Służba Więzienna also use them as well).

From 1 May 2004, the day Poland became a member of the [[European Union]], Straż Graniczna performs its responsibility to guard and protect both the Polish and EU borders.

The '''Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa''' (CAFCA) is a research and lobbying organisation combatting what it considers the sell-out of New Zealand companies and assets to overseas interests. The organisation evolved from the then-named Campaign Against Foreign Control in New Zealand &lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicalwatchdog.blogspot.com/2009/01/comalco-comic.html&lt;/ref&gt; which began in the early 1970s.

The organisation was founded by [[Owen Wilkes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.converge.org.nz/abc/pr40-199.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic criticism==

One of the main planks of CAFCA is opposition against foreign acquisition of New Zealand assets. In this regard, they criticise the free-market policies which have made such foreign acquisition possible, and the fact that the relevant regulatory authorities (such as the [[Overseas Investment Office]]) are amongst the weakest government branches, '[[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber-stamping]]' investment instead of regulating it.&lt;ref name="SALE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10473472"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10473472 |title=US buyer snaps up Coromandel jewel |author=Gay, Edward |date=1 November 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct ownership of New Zealand companies by foreign parties increased from $9.7&amp;nbsp;billion in 1989 to $83&amp;nbsp;billion in 2007 (an over 700% increase), while 41% of the New Zealand sharemarket valuation is now overseas-owned, compared to 19% in 1989. Around 7% of all New Zealand agriculturally productive land is also foreign-owned. CAFCA considers that the effect of such takeovers has generally been negative in terms of jobs and wages.&lt;ref name="SALE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10419011 |title=Matt McCarten: Foreign owners muscle in as New Zealand sells off all its assets |author=McCarten, Matt |date=14 January 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17868">'''Captain-major''' is the [[English language|English]] rendering of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Capitão-mor'', or the ''Capitães dos Donatários'' (''Captains of the Donataries''), the colonial officials, placed in charge of a [[Captaincy]] ({{lang-pt|capitania}}), deemed not (yet) important enough to have its own colonial [[Governor]].

The term also applied as the rank title of the [[field officer]] that was in charge of a captaincy (group of companies) of the ''[[Ordenanças]]'', the Portuguese territorial militia that existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries.

==Captaincy system==
Due to the impossibility of exercising direct control and sovereignty over overseas territories, the captain-major was the channel by which the monarch could delegate his powers, with certain restrictions, under the responsibility of peoples he felt he could confide. The ''Donatário'' could administer, in the sovereign's name, the lands for which he was assigned, with all the regalia, rights and obligations, with the exception of certain limits, including military authority over soldiers and detachments of the crown, or the administration of justice.

The Captains were agents named by the Dontário, and after 1495, by the Crown, to a lifetime title that was passed down by the "legitimate male heirs".&lt;ref name="Costa236"&gt;Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.236&lt;/ref&gt; As administrators, the Captains enjoyed various judicial and economic privileges that provided an incentive to settle and develop their captaincies.&lt;ref name=Costa236/&gt; They had the authority to administer sentences, with the exception of those involving penalties of death or mutilation.&lt;ref name=Costa236/&gt; Economically, they had the exclusive authority to mill, bake bread and sell salt, in addition to their entitlement to receive rent paid to the King for lands, fees and taxes due.&lt;ref name=Costa236/&gt; In addition, they could receive a [[tithe]] (the tenth portion) paid to the captaincy directly.&lt;ref name=Costa236/&gt; In addition to the regalia of office, the captains-major would hold title to the best parcels of lands and be able to contract renters to the donatárias (lands of the Donatários), in the name of the crown.&lt;ref name=Costa236/&gt; Many of the donatários were hereditary, with a few exceptions, referred in the [[Salic Law]]s ({{lang-pt|Leis Sálicas}}) of the time; these laws regulated all aspects of life, including crime, taxation, indemnity, and female inheritance.&lt;ref name=Costa236/&gt; The Captains were less restricted to these conditions.&lt;ref name=Costa236/&gt;

Yet, many of these captains were selected as part of a consolidation of relationships between the Donatários and their vassals. This subjective process usually involved close associations with the royal family or confidants of the Crown: a feudal meritocracy of vassals.&lt;ref name=Costa236/&gt; This could result from rendering service during the overseas expansion or resulting from some heroism which may have been rewarded with a title.&lt;ref name="Costa237"&gt;Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.237&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch surrounded himself with "trustworthy" men who were existed within a web of relationships, forming a restricted circle of individuals.&lt;ref name=Costa237/&gt; In some cases precedents were superseded in favour of people they could trust, including setting aside the laws of male inheritance in favour of a daughter, for example (as with the case of the daughter of [[Jácome de Bruges]]).&lt;ref name=Costa237/&gt; Yet, most had to prove themselves, as was the case with [[Álvaro de Ornelas]] (captain of Pico), who lost his captaincy due to "inefficiency" in its settlement.&lt;ref name=Costa237/&gt;

The captaincy system was built on confidence and good faith between the captain and donatário, owing to the distance between each.&lt;ref name="Costa238"&gt;Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.238&lt;/ref&gt; This weakened the Donatário's control over the officials, resulting in a disparity between actual and perceived function.&lt;ref name=Costa238/&gt; Some were either incompetent in their roles, power-hungry or just absent.&lt;ref name=Costa238/&gt; In some cases the inhabitants of certain possessions were often subject to irregularities resulting from judicial or fiscal issues.&lt;ref name=Costa238/&gt; Some captains appointed overseers, ''ouvidores'' (''auditors'') to represent them who were unqualified to respond to the issues of their masters.&lt;ref name=Costa238/&gt;

==Captaincies==
The following is an incomplete list of some of the captaincies and their first Donatary-Captains:

===Madeira===
[[File:Petrus Roselli. Carte marine de l'océan Atlantique Nord-Est de la mer Méditerranée et de la mer Noire. 1462.jpg|thumb|235px|Medieval map showing the Atlantic frontier and settlements along the sea (Petrus Roselli) Bibliothèque nationale de France]]
There were three captaincies in the archipelago of [[Madeira]], associated with the three principal discoverers of the islands:
* [[Funchal]], was bestowed to ''Capitão Donatário'' [[João Gonçalves Zarco]]
* [[Machico]], was bestowed to ''Capitão Donatário'' [[Tristão Vaz Teixeira]]
* [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]], was appointed to ''Capitão Donatário'' [[Bartolomeu Perestrello]]

===Azores===
[[File:1563 lazaro luis 04 atlantic nord.jpg|thumb|235px|The Lazaro Luís map of the Atlantic (1563) showing the Azores and Madeira]]
{{main|Captaincies of the Azores}}
Following their discovery, [[Gonçalo Velho Cabral]] became the first Donatary-Captain of the islands, beginning with the island of Santa Maria, but later including the island of São Miguel when it was discovered. This captaincy, which lasted from 1439 to 1461, was described in 1460 by [[Henry the Navigator]] in a letter to Cabral as ''Capitão por mim em minhas ilhas de Santa Maria e São Miguel dos Açores'' (''Captain for Me in My Islands of Santa Maria and São Miguel in the Azores''). The progressive discovery of the islands of the archipelago resulted in new captaincies; in total, there have been thirteen unique captaincies in Azores since their discovery:
* [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], part of the captaincy of Gonçalo Velho Cabral, Santa Maria and São Miguel, was later divided by his nephew [[João Soares de Albergaria]], and Santa Maria left in the hands of his descendents;
* [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], part of the captaincy of Gonçalo Velho Cabral was sold by [[João Soares de Albergaria]] to its third ''Captain Donatário'' Rui Gonçalves da Câmara;
* [[Angra do Heroísmo|Angra]], originally a single administration under the captaincy of [[Jácome de Bruges]], the southern portion of Terceira was carved out and allocated to [[João Vaz Corte-Real]];
* [[Praia da Vitória|Praia]], quarrelling between João Vaz Corte-Real and [[Álvaro Martins|Álvaro Martins Homem]] after the mysterious "disappearance" of Jácome de Bruge, resulted in the latter receiving Praia;
* [[Praia (Santa Cruz da Graciosa)|Praia da Graciosa]], initially allocated to [[Duarte Barreto do Couto]] at the time of its early settlement, his mysterious disappearance left it in the caretaker-ship of his wife, until her brother [[Vasco Gil Sodré]] came to assist her in guaranteeing it within her family;
* [[Santa Cruz (parish)|Santa Cruz]], Pedro Correio da Cunha (brother-in-law of Christopher Columbus), who arrived on the island from Porto Santo, obtained the captaincy in 1474, after the mysterious disappearance of Duarte Barreto do Couto;
* [[Santa Cruz da Graciosa|Graciosa]], Vasco Gil Sodré attempted to obtain the captaincy of Graciosa following a Castilian incursion in 1475. but using the same logic, the crown decided to unify the island under one captain: Pedro Correio do Couto.
* [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]], originally bestowed to João Vaz Corte-Real, the island was a fiefdom of Terceira, until re-incorporated by the Crown, after Manuel de Moura Corte-Real, donatary captain of Angra, decided to maintain his allegiance to Philip III;
* [[Faial Island|Faial]], the island was placed under the administration of [[Josse van Huerter]], even after he failed on his first attempt to settle the island. This would be a discrepancy, since his second attempt at settling and developing the territory resulted in greater expansion;
* [[Pico Island|Pico]], Álvaro de Ornelas attempted to settle the island from 1460, bringing colonists from northern Portugal, who arrived by way of Terceira and Graciosa, but his attempt was slow and resulted in failure;
* Faial and Pico, the island of Pico was incorporated into the Faialense administration of the Huerter/Dutra family on 29 December 1482, following the inefficient failure of Álvaro de Ornelas to spearhead and expand settlements;
* Flores and Corvo, developed without any clear statue and late in its settlement, the dual island fiefdom functioned within a feudal hierarchy, following its settlement by [[Diogo de Teive]].

There was a high level of '''[[conscientious objection]] in [[East Germany]]'''.

==Introduction of conscription==
In April 1962 the GDR government introduced military [[conscription]]. The period of compulsory service was at least 18 [[month]]s, and adult males between 18 and 26 were eligible. Service in the [[National People's Army]] (in German abbreviated as NVA), the paramilitary forces of the [[Volkspolizei|People's Police]] and the motorised rifles regiment of the Ministry for State Security fulfilled this service obligation. (In the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], conscription was introduced in 1958.)

In the first year, despite the possibility of [[imprisonment]] or worse, 231 draftees refused to serve. Most were members of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. The number increased to 287 when the second year's cohort was conscripted.

The GDR's [[socialism|socialist]] government viewed [[conscientious objector]]s as [[enemy of the state|enemies of the state]], and all 287 were arrested. When the country's influential Protestant Church protested, the government decided to provide a legal means for conscientious objectors to serve as non-combatants in the armed forces. It thus became the only socialist state in history to provide a non-combat alternative for pacifist citizens.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Baueinheiten==
On 16 September 1964 the GDR government announced the formation of non-combat construction units, or ''Baueinheiten,'' to provide an alternative for conscripts who could not bear arms because of a personal objection to military service. The ''[[Bausoldaten]]'' lived in barracks and were subject to military discipline, but did not bear arms or participate in combat training.  Their grey uniforms resembled those of the regular infantry with the symbol of a spade on their shoulder boards which had pale green edges. Normally, construction units were isolated from soldiers in regular units to prevent the spread of [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas.

Though outwardly peaceful in appearance, soldiers in ''Baueinheiten'' were obliged to make a promise of loyalty in which they stated that they would "fight against all enemies and obey their superiors unconditionally", though this was replaced by an oath to "increase defense readiness" in the 1980s. 

They performed military construction and rear-guard services, repaired [[tank]]s and military equipment, as well as some tasks in the industrial and social-service sectors, were subject to military law and disciplinary regulations, were commanded by NVA officers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs), and received engineer training and political education. 

In 1983, of the 230,000 soldiers in the NVA, 0.6 percent—about 1,400—were allowed to serve in the construction units.  According to one report, however, the number of conscripts electing such service was so high that draft officials claimed the plan was over fulfilled, and in 1983 young East Germans unwilling to bear arms had to join the regular troops.  In February 1983, in [[Schwerin]], Dresden, and East Berlin, five young men were sentenced to eighteen months in prison because they tried to exercise their right to join the construction units.  Service in the construction troops did, however, have certain consequences.

In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former construction soldiers were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.  They were not allowed to enter certain professions or to pursue a university education.  In 1984, however, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] General Secretary [[Erich Honecker]] and Defense Minister [[Army general (East Germany)|Army General]] [[Heinz Hoffmann]] asserted that construction soldiers no longer suffered such discrimination; like others who had completed their military service, they were given preference in the university admission process.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+gx0143%29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prague Spring==
In 1968 [[Warsaw Pact]] states, with the tacit support but not direct involvement of East Germany, [[invasion|invaded]] [[Czechoslovakia]] and deposed [[Alexander Dubček]] in what came to be known as the [[Prague Spring]].

This invasion appalled people all over the world, but especially East Germans, many of whom felt guilty for letting their government support it. Following the Prague Spring, many young East German men refused to serve even in ''Baueinheiten'', as they felt that something akin to another Prague Spring could be just around the corner, and they wished to play no part in it.

==Leaving East Germany==
Between 1984 and 1985, 71,000 East Germans were expelled from the country for participation in civil rights movements. Many people who wished to [[emigration|emigrate]] from East Germany would do things such as refuse to serve in the NVA to be put on the "[[black list]]" and expelled.

By the late 1980s, the vast majority of conscientious objectors was composed of people who wished to emigrate.

'''Electronic Frontiers Georgia (EFGA)''' is a [[non-profit]] organization in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] that raises public awareness of issues relating to [[Cyber law]] and [[free speech]]. It was founded in 1995 by [[Tom Cross (computer security)|Tom Cross]], Robert Costner, Chris Farris, and Robbie Honerkamp, primarily in response to the [[Communications Decency Act]].  

One of the early causes which the organization championed, was reaction to Georgia House Bill 1630, an attempt to ban anonymous speech on the Internet in Georgia. Though the bill was passed into law in the legislature, after a lawsuit from the EFGA, the [[ACLU]], and the national [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), the law was deemed unconstitutional.

{{Citation needed span|text=EFGA was dissolved in 2002.|date=August 2017}}{{Dubious|reason=The EFGA is still actively hosting meetings as of August 2017, and sources documenting the "dissolution" cannot be found.|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.ale/62555/focus=62558 EFGA, whatever happened to it?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422135131/http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.ale/62555/focus%3D62558 |date=2017-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Since EFGA has been active every year since inception, the veracity of this comment is in question. It is left in place as a pseudo homage to the "Biographies of Living Persons" issue (controversy) that Wikipedia has.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Electronic Frontiers Georgia began from a suggestion of Stanton McCandlish (mech) of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in email conversations with Atlanta businessman and computer store owner Robert Costner.  Robert had expressed concern over a Philip Elmer DeWitt's Time Magazine article claiming pornography was pervasive on the internet.  Robert was angered because on its face Robert thought the article was bogus.  While DeWitt and Time later apologized&lt;ref&gt;[Time magazine, October 1995, retraction by Philip Elmer-Dewitt]&lt;/ref&gt; for the article, this was a precursor to the Communications Decency Act.

Seeking suitable partners to provide in-kind donations Robert approached the Georgia ACLU for meeting space, and Comstar, an internet hosting company, for rackspace for an internet server from Robert's computer store.

On local newsgroups Robert announced a public meeting to be held at the ACLU's downtown offices.  From this, and similar meetings, other local Georgia residents joined in and became a part of Electronic Frontiers Georgia.  Most notably were [[Tom Cross (computer security)|Tom Cross]], Chris Farris, and Robbie Honerkamp.  Tom, Chris, and Robbie were instrumental in helping found the organization with Robert.  At a later point Andy Dustman and Scott M. Jones joined the organization in significant capacities.

EFGA was founded with the mission to explore the intersection of public policy and technology.

== Distinction from EFF ==
Though often confused with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), EFGA is a separate organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.eff.org/Activism/ACTION/FAQs_split_versions/activ_g5.faq EFF Online Civil Liberties Activism Organizations List]&lt;/ref&gt; EFF is the premier civil liberties organization in the online world.  A program of EFF was to foster the creation of local activism organizations that while had similar goals and names, were not chapters of EFF, but separate organizations.  While seeding these organizations EFF would ask that the Electronic Frontier (singular) name not be used, but that rather the local independent organization use the plural version, Electronic Frontier'''s'''.  EFF's Stanton McCandlish helped seed these organizations in several states, not just Georgia.  The two groups have worked together on many projects.

Shari Steele, Executive Director of EFF was even on the same stage as Robert Costner, Executive Director of EFGA for a speaking engagement at [[Georgia Perimeter College]] in Clarkston, Georgia.  EFF accepted an invitation to participate in the HB1630 lawsuit, and EFGA has signed onto several ''amicus'' briefs along with EFF.  EFF is a regular participant in EFGA's Electronic Frontiers Forums.

== Various projects ==
Electronic Frontiers Georgia has led various projects over the last 20+ years.  These include the HB1630 lawsuit&lt;ref&gt;[Internet Bill Struck Down by Court, Atlanta Journal-Constitution article, front page, June 20, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; concerning internet anonymity, the Georgia Cracker anonymous remailer, Encryption legislation and the S.A.F.E. bill (1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Vin | last=Suprynowicz | title=Good cop, bad cop | url=http://www.xmission.com/pub/lists/utah-firearms/archive/utah-firearms.9709 | newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal | location= | date=12 September 1997 | agency=Mountain Media Syndications | at=line 1438}}&lt;/ref&gt; the DC copyright summit (1996) challenging the Software Publisher's Association's (SPA) copyright enforcement policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Piracy campaign revamped | url=http://news.cnet.com/Piracy-campaign-revamped/2100-1023_3-244459.html | newspaper=CNET News | location= | date=6 November 1996 | agency= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the U-Haul lawsuit (2000), and the defeat of the Georgia "Super DMCA" Bill (2004) to ban the sale of DVRs, Television, and related devices not approved by the Cable companies. In 2005 EFGA was involved nationally with the verifiable voting issue.

Other issues EFGA has been involved in include fingerprinting, biometrics in ID cards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Vin | last=Suprynowicz | title=If we're treated like a number, we're property | url=http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0898nationalid.htm | newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal | location= | date=August 1998 | agency=Mountain Media Syndications }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Alex | last=Lash | title=Experian to help email marketers | url=http://news.cnet.com/Experian-to-help-email-marketers/2100-1033_3-202815.html | newspaper=CNET News | location= | date=28 August 1997 | agency= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a yearly report on Georgia technology legislation.

== HB1630 ==
One of the early projects of EFGA was to deal with the passage of what was known as Georgia HB1630, the Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act. [[Don Parsons (politician)]] of the 40th district, a BellSouth employee, sponsored the bill which was passed and went into effect on July 1, 1996.  The Georgia computer law made it a crime to falsely identify yourself on the internet, such as by using a handle or screen name in an "electronic mailbox." There were also significant implications about hyperlinks as the law made criminal provisions concerning the use of trade names, registered trademarks, logos, and copyrighted symbols in hyperlinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Kanell | title=Personal Technology State Bill to regulate some Internet Activities is killed | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=10 March 1996 | page=G.06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While reported as being effectively "killed" by being tabled, the bill was passed ten days later by both houses.

EFGA's Executive Director Robert Costner went to the Georgia ACLU to see if they were interested in a legal challenge of the law, but the response from Teresa Nelson was "no" stating that it was not a significant issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Kanell | title=Bill aims to protect logos, trademarks | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=19 March 1996 | page=C.03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After discussions with Rep. [[Mitchell Kaye]], Mr. Costner used his personal funds to engage an attorney, J. Scott McClain of Boundarant, Mixson &amp; Elmore, to frame the case in a way that it would later be of interest to groups like the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Art| last=Kramer| title=ACLU seeking the anonymous | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=18 August 1996 | page=H.04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next step would be for EFGA to form a coalition of plaintiffs to oppose the newly passed law.

The lawsuit was not EFGA's first reaction to the new law. In an attempt to avoid the hassle of a lawsuit and avoid costs on both sides, on July 3, 1996 EFGA send a letter to Attorney General [[Mike Bowers]] asking him to issue a ruling to clarify the meaning of the law.  On July 16, 1996, Bowers turned down EFGA's request and they proceeded forward with filing the lawsuit.

This became EFGA's model for dealing with future issues.  Try to deal with the matter at the lowest level before escalating it.  Always deal with the issues, not the personalities.  and finally form a broad coalition of support by engaging diverse groups in the issue. With the help of attorney J. Scott McClain, the local Georgia ACLU was brought on board.  They brought in the national ACLU which took over funding of the lawsuit.  EFF joined in next with a total of 13 plaintiffs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jared| last=Sandberg| title=Suit challenges state's restraint of the Internet | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=25 September 1996 | page=B1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; joining together to submit affidavits for the case.

On September 24, 1996 EFGA, along with the ACLU, EFF, and other plaintiffs filed the lawsuit against the state alleging that the Georgia law barring the use of pseudonyms and anonymous communications on the internet was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Art| last=Kramer| title=ACLU sues the state over its ban on some Internet communication | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=25 September 1996 | page=D.03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EFGA's position was multifaceted alleging unconstitutionality in protection of anonymous speech, free speech for news and satire in web linking, [[commerce clause]] violations, and unconstitutional vagueness in the language of the law. 

EFGA ultimately prevailed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Alex | last=Lash | title=Courts block state speech laws | url=http://news.cnet.com/Courts-block-state-speech-laws/2100-1023_3-200794.html | newspaper=CNET News | location= | date=20 June 1997 | agency= }}&lt;/ref&gt; against the state in federal court winning the preliminary injunction in 1997 effectively overturning the Georgia Law against the use of pseudonyms on the internet.

== Georgia Cracker remailer ==
EFGA established and ran the Georgia Cracker &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/privacy/anon-server/faq/use/part3/ Remailer Web Pages]&lt;/ref&gt; anonymous remailer and the Redneck nymserver. Elements of this were featured in a television interview with Robert Costner on a segment on 20/20 about email and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[ABC 20/20 Television episode, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to running its own anonymous remailer, EFGA also maintains an automated list of working remailers, updated daily. The EFGA remailer resources are known to be the best available in the world.  In the Spring 2003 issue of 2600 Magazine the EFGA website was described as the best and most current source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Anonymous E-mail Using Remailers | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/15059577/2600The-Hacker-QuarterlySpring-2003XX000013241XX-29593 | newspaper=2600 Magazine | location= | date=Spring 2003 | agency= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for information about anonymous remailers.

== Electronic Frontiers Forums ==
[[File:EF Forums audience.jpg|thumb|Attendees of the 2008 Electronic Frontiers Forums by Electronic Frontiers Georgia]]The Electronic Frontiers Forums is a yearly event held in Atlanta, Georgia over the labor day weekend each year at DragonCon.  The Forums are a series of seminars held for 12 hours a day for the three days of the holiday weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efforums.net/ Electronic Frontiers Forums]&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Costner, also a founding director of DragonCon, offered to provide content for the popular science fiction convention in exchange for meeting space to provide advocacy about issues affecting the intersection of politics and technology.  Robert ran the forums each year along with the help of Scott M. Jones until Robert moved to Washington, DC.  Scott now runs the yearly event which has been in continual existence for over ten years, with the assistance of [[Andrew Norton (Pirate Party)|Andrew Norton]]

The Electronic Frontiers Forums features speakers from local law firms and local technology companies.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation sends a speaker some years.  The topics range from serious legal issues to fun items like webcam girls.

In late 2006 the Electronic Frontiers Georgia website went down.  This was due to administrative reasons.  The domain registration fees were not paid to TuCows and they took the domain and refused to give it back. Despite repeated requests to return the domain TuCows said no.  Current EFGA activities are now handled on other EFGA websites that existed prior to the loss of the main EFGA website.

'''Empowerment evaluation''' (EE) is an [[evaluation]] approach designed to help communities monitor and evaluate their own performance. It is used in comprehensive community initiatives as well as small-scale settings and is designed to help groups accomplish their goals. According to David Fetterman, "Empowerment evaluation is the use of evaluation concepts, techniques, and findings to foster improvement and [[self-determination]]".{{sfn|Fetterman|1994}} An expanded definition is: "Empowerment evaluation is an evaluation approach that aims to increase the likelihood that programs will achieve results by increasing the capacity of program [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s to plan, implement, and evaluate their own programs."{{sfn|Wandersman|Snell-Johns|Lentz|Fetterman|Keener|Livet|Imm|Flaspohler|2005}}
{{toclimit|3}}

==Scope==
Empowerment evaluation has been used in programs ranging from a fifteen million dollar [[Hewlett-Packard]] corporate [[philanthropy]] effort{{sfn|Fetterman|2005|pp=98-107}} to accreditation in [[higher education]]{{sfn|Fetterman|2011}} and from the [[NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]’s Mars [[Mars Exploration Rover|Mars Rover]] project{{sfn|Fetterman|Bowman|2002}} to [[battered women's shelter]]s.{{sfn|Andrews|1996}} Empowerment evaluation has been used by government, foundations, businesses, and non-profits, as well as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations. It is a global phenomenon, with projects and workshops around the world including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Finland, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A sample of sponsors and clients includes [[Casey Family Programs]], [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]], Family &amp; Children Services, Health Trust, [[Knight Foundation]], Poynter, [[Stanford University]], State of Arkansas, [[UNICEF]] and [[Volunteers of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidfetterman.com/Videos.htm videos]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and publications==

Empowerment evaluation was introduced in 1993 by David Fetterman during his presidential address at the [[American Evaluation Association]]’s (AEA) annual meeting.{{sfn|Fetterman|1994}}

The approach was initially well received by some researchers who commented on the complementary relationship between EE and [[community psychology]], [[social work]], [[community development]] and [[adult education]]. They highlighted how it inverted traditional definitions of evaluation, shifting power from the evaluator to program staff and participants. Early supporters positively noted the focus on social justice and self-determination. One colleague compared the writings of approach to [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]].{{sfn|Altman|1997}}{{sfn|Brown|1997}}{{sfn|Wild|1997}}

''Empowerment Evaluation: Knowledge and Tools for Self-assessment and Accountability''{{sfn|Fetterman|Kaftarian|Wandersman|1996}} the first empowerment evaluation book, provided an introduction to theory and practice. It highlighted EE's scope, ranging from its use in a national [[educational reform]] movement to its endorsement by the [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation]]’s Director of Evaluation. The book presented examples in various contexts, including: federal, state, and local government, [[HIV prevention]] and related health initiatives, [[African American]] communities and battered women’s shelters. This first volume also provided various theoretical and philosophical frameworks as well as workshop and technical assistance tools. 
 
''Foundations of Empowerment Evaluation,''{{sfn|Fetterman|2001b}} was the second EE book. The book provided steps and cases. It highlighted the role of the [[Internet]] to facilitate and disseminate the approach.

The third book was titled: ''Empowerment evaluation principles in practice.''{{sfn|Fetterman|Wandersman|2004}} It emphasized greater conceptual clarity by making explicit EE's underlying principles, ranging from improvement and inclusion to [[capacity building]] and [[social justice]]. In addition, it highlighted its commitment to [[accountability]] and outcomes, by stating them as an explicit principle and presenting substantive outcome examples. Cases described include educational reform, [[youth development]] programs and [[child abuse]] prevention programs.&lt;ref&gt;See Donaldson, 2005 review of ''Empowerment evaluation principles in practice''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==

The primary theories guiding empowerment evaluation are process use and theories of use and action.{{sfn|Argyris|Schon|1978}}{{sfn|Patton|1997a}}{{sfn|Patton|1997b}}

Process use represents much of the rationale or logic underlying EE in practice, because it cultivates ownership by placing the approach in community and staff members’ hands.

The alignment of theories of use and action explain how empowerment evaluation helps people produce desired results.{{sfn|Dunst|Trivette|LaPointe|1992}}{{sfn|Zimmerman|2000}}{{sfn|Zimmerman|Israel|Schultz|Checkoway|1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zimmerman|Rappaport|1988}} See [[Albert Bandura|Bandura]], 1982 concerning self-efficacy.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Alkin|Christie|2004}}{{sfn|Christie|2003}}

==Process use==

Empowerment evaluation is designed to be used by people. It places evaluation in the hands of community and staff members. The more that people are engaged in conducting their own evaluations the more likely they are to believe in them, because the evaluation findings are theirs. In addition, a byproduct of this experience is that they learn to think lucratively.{{clarify|date=January 2013}} This makes them more likely to make decisions and take actions based on their evaluation data. This way of thinking is at the heart of process use.{{sfn|Patton|1997b|p=189}}

==Principles==

Empowerment evaluation is guided by 10 principles.{{sfn|Fetterman|Wandersman|2004|pp=1–2, 27-41,42-72}} These principles help evaluators and community members align decisions with the larger purpose or goals associated with capacity building and self-determination.

#Improvement – help people improve program performance
#[[Community ownership]] – value and facilitate community control
#Inclusion – invite involvement, participation, and diversity
#Democratic participation – open participation and fair decision making
#Social justice – address social inequities in society 
#Community knowledge – respect and value community knowledge 
#Evidence-based strategies – respect and use both community and scholarly knowledge
#Capacity building – enhance stakeholder ability to evaluate and improve planning and implementation
#[[Organizational learning]] – apply data to evaluate and implement practices and inform decision making
#Accountability – emphasize outcomes and accountability

==Concepts==

Key concepts include: [[critical friend]]s, cultures of evidence, cycles of reflection and action, communities of learners, and [[Reflective practice|reflective practitioners]].{{sfn|Fetterman|Deitz|Gesundheit|2010}} A critical friend, for example, is an evaluator who provide constructive [[feedback]].{{sfn|Fetterman|2009}} They help to ensure the evaluation remains organized, rigorous and honest.

==Steps==

EE's three-step approach includes:{{sfn|Fetterman|2001a}}{{sfn|Fetterman|2001b}}

#establish their mission; 
#review their current status; and 
#plan for the future.

This approach is popular in part due to its simplicity, effectiveness and transparency.

A second approach is the 10-step Getting to Outcomes (GTO).{{sfn|Wandersman|Imm|Chinman|Kaftarian|2000}} GTO helps participants answer 10 questions using relevant literature, methods and tools. The 10 accountability questions and literature to address them are:

#What are the needs and resources? ([[Needs assessment]]; resource assessment)
#What are the goals, target population and desired outcomes? (Goal setting)
#How does the intervention incorporate knowledge of science and best practices in this area? (Science and best practices)
#How does the intervention fit with existing programs? (Collaboration; [[cultural competence]])
#What capacities do you need to implement a quality program? (Capacity building)
#How will this intervention be carried out? (Planning)
#How will the quality of implementation be assessed? (Process evaluation)
#How well did the intervention work? (Outcome and impact evaluation)
#How will quality improvement strategies be incorporated? ([[Total quality management]]; continuous quality improvement)
#If the intervention is (or components are) successful, how will the intervention be sustained? (Sustainability and institutionalization)

A manual with worksheets addresses how to answer the questions.{{sfn|Chinman|Imm|Wandersman|2004}} While GTO has been used primarily in [[substance abuse]] prevention, customized GTOs have been developed for preventing [[underage drinking]]{{sfn|Imm|Chinman|Wandersman|2006}} and promoting positive youth development.{{sfn|Fisher|Imm|Chinman|Wandersman|2006}} Several books are downloadable. In addition, EE can employ photo journalism, online surveys, virtual conferencing and self-assessments.{{sfn|Sabo|2001}}

==Monitoring==

Conventional and innovative evaluation tools monitor outcomes, including online surveys, focus groups and interviews, as well as the use of quasi-experimental designs. In addition, program specific metrics are developed, using baselines, benchmarks, goals and actual performance. For example, a minority tobacco prevention program in Arkansas established:

#Baselines (the number of tobacco users)
#Goals (the yearly number of subjects helped)
#Benchmarks (the monthly number of subjects helped)
#Performance (the number of subjects who stop smoking)

These metrics help the community monitor implementation, by comparing performance with benchmarks. It also enables them to make mid-course corrections.

==Selected case examples==

[[Stanford University School of Medicine]] applied the technique to curricular decision making.{{sfn|Fetterman|Deitz|Gesundheit|2010}} EE contributed to improvements in course and clerkship{{clarify|date=January 2013}} ratings. For example, the average student ratings for required courses improved significantly (P = .04; Student’s one-sample t test).

EE guided Hewlett-Packard’s $15 million [[Digital Village]] Initiative. The initiative was designed to help bridge the digital divide in communities of color. Outcomes ranged from Native American’s building one of the largest unlicensed wireless systems in the country to creating a high-resolution [[digital printing]] press.{{sfn|Fetterman|2005|pp=98-107}}

The State of Arkansas used EE in academically distressed schools and tobacco prevention. Outcomes include improving test scores, upgrading school-level performance and preventing and reducing [[tobacco consumption]].{{sfn|Fetterman|2005|pp=107-121}}{{sfn|Fetterman|Wandersman|2007}}

A school district in South Carolina invested millions of their own dollars to provide each student with a personalized computing device as an educational tool. EE was used to support large scale implementation of the initiative and monitor outcomes associated with teacher and student behavior change.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, A., Wright, A., Wandersman, A, &amp; Hamm, D. (2014). An empowerment evaluation approach to implementing with quality at scale. In Fetterman, Kaftarian, &amp; Wandersman (Eds), Empowerment evaluation: Knowledge and tools for self assessment, evaluation capacity building, &amp; accountability (2nd ed).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
===Response to critique===
EE is conducted by an internal group, not an external individual. Programs are dynamic, not static and thus require more fluid, responsive, and continual assessment. The evaluator becomes a coach, rather than the expert. Investigating worth and merit is not sufficient. The focus should also be on program improvement. Empowerment evaluation, as a group activity, builds in self-checks on bias. Internal and external forms of evaluation are compatible and reinforcing. However, the Joint Committee's standards were applied and empowerment evaluation was found to be consistent with the spirit of the standards. Empowerment evaluation is not a threat to traditional evaluation. It may instead help to revitalize it.{{sfn|Fetterman|1995}}

Empowerment evaluation is part of an emancipatory research stream. Its unique contribution is its focus on fostering self-determination and building capacity. Empowerment evaluation is guided by process use. Additional effort could be made to further distinguish empowerment from collaborative, participatory, stakeholder, and utilization forms of evaluation. Empowerment evaluation should be limited or focused on the disenfranchised and issues of liberation. Empowerment evaluation has become a part of the evaluation landscape.{{sfn|Patton(1997a}}

Empowerment evaluation is part of a worldwide movement. It is now part of the evaluation field. However, empowerment evaluation needs to focus on the consumer, rather than staff members. In addition, the definition of empowerment evaluation has changed. Bias in evaluation can be removed by distancing oneself from the group or program being assessed. Internal and external forms of evaluation are needed. Empowerment evaluators serve as evaluation consultants.{{sfn|Scriven|997}}

The definition of empowerment is the same as when the approach was first defined and introduced to the field. However, it has been expanded to further clarify the purpose of the approach. Fetterman and Wandersman agree that empowerment evaluation is part of an emancipatory stream of research. It also relies on process use to guide it. They also believe that greater effort is needed to further distinguish empowerment from other forms of stakeholder involved approaches. However, empowerment evaluation can be viewed along a continuum from less empowering to more empowering in nature. Empowerment evaluation is designed to help the disenfranchised. However, the boundaries are much broader and inclusive. Everyone can benefit from self-assessment and becoming more self-determined.&lt;br&gt;
Fetterman advocated that evaluation be shared with a broader population.{{sfn|Fetterman|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David M. Fetterman |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0886163394900558 |title= Empowerment evaluation|date=2002-07-03 |accessdate=2013-01-27 |doi=10.1016/0886-1633(94)90055-8 |volume=15 |journal=Evaluation Practice |pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates and controversy==

Empowerment evaluation challenged the status quo concerning who is in control of an evaluation and what it means to be an evaluator. Conventionally, evaluations are conducted by a specialist. In EE, the group or community performs the evaluation, guided by an empowerment evaluator or “critical friend.”

===First wave of criticism===

Shufflebeam claimed that evaluation should be left in the hands of professionals who objectively investigate the worth or merit of an object and that EE violates the (as yet unadopted) Joint Committee's Program Evaluation Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcsee.org/program-evaluation-standards/program-evaluation-standards-statements |title=Program Evaluation Standards Statements « Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation |publisher=Jcsee.org |date= 2010-10-27|accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Stufflebeam|1994}}

Fetterman and Scriven agreed on the value of both internal and external evaluations. They also agree on a focus on the consumer. However, staff members, sponsors, and policy makers also have important roles to play in evaluation. Scriven however claimed that the evaluator must maintain distance from program participants to avoid bias.{{sfn|Fetterman|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Debate between Fetterman, Patton and Scriven is available online in text form from [http://survey.ate.wmich.edu/jmde/index.php/jmde_1/article/view/260/250 ''Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation'']. It was also recorded and is available in [http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/lap&amp;CISOPTR=69&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=14 Claremont's virtual library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelimsky re-framed the discussion between Fetterman, Patton and Scriven, explaining that evaluations serve multiple purposes: 1) accountability; 2) development; and 3) knowledge. Scriven, and to a lesser extent Patton, focused on accountability, while Fetterman focused on development.{{sfn|Fetterman|1997}}

===Second wave ===

The second wave of debate and discussion emerged between 2005-2007. The primary critiques focused on conceptual and methodological clarity:

Cousins attempted to differentiate between similar approaches, e.g. collaborative, participatory, and empowerment evaluation. Cousins asked whether EE is practical (focusing on decision making), or transformative (focusing on self-determination) and viewed self-evaluation as more likely to have a [[self-serving bias]]. This critic noted the variability in attempts at empowerment evaluation.{{sfn|Cousins|2005}}

Miller and Campbell conducted a systematic literature review of empowerment evaluation. They highlighted types or modes of EE, as well as settings, reasons for use, selection process and degree of participation. The highlighted practice variants depending on the size of the evaluation. They suggested that clients were selecting it for appropriate reasons, such as capacity building, self-determination, accountability, cultivating ownership and institutionalization of evaluations. However, they also found that approximately 25% were empowerment in name only. In addition, they argued for additional conceptual clarity.{{sfn|Miller|Campbell|2006}}

Patton accepted EE as part of the evaluation field and proposed that given its established status, additional clarity distinguishing collaborative, participatory, utilization and empowerment evaluation would be fruitful. He acknowledged improvements ranging improved definitions and added the 10 principles. He was concerned that self-determination was not on the list. Patton applauded and recommended process use for empowerment evaluation. He accepted the contributors' commitment to forthrightly describing problems. Patton proposed greater emphasis on outcomes or results in EE.{{sfn|Patton|2005}}

Scriven believes that self-evaluation is flawed, because it is inherently self-serving, and rejected its use for professional development.{{sfn|Scriven|2005}} He questioned the ability of EE to actually empower people and recommended a neutral evaluator role. He suggested that internal and external evaluations are not compatible. He also suggests that empowerment as well as randomized controls are merely forms of ideology.{{sfn|Smith|2007}}

===Response to critique===

Fetterman and Wandersman responded by attempting to enhance conceptual clarity, provide greater methodological specificity and highlight EEs commitment to accountability and outcomes. They acknowledged and applauded Miller and Campbell's systematic review of EE projects, while noting neglected or omitted case examples and questioning some of their methodology.

They claimed that the 10 principles contributed to conceptual clarity and that people empower themselves. They asserted that evaluations are inherently subjective and are shaped by culture and political context, and that EE is committed to honesty and rigor. EE is more inclusive than traditional evaluations, placing cross-checks on data and decisions. Participants often know more about problems than outsiders and have a vested interest in making their programs work.&lt;!--pass the evals to keep the money flowing?--&gt; They claimed that internal and external evaluations can operate together effectively as additional cross-checks.

While the similarities among collaborative, participatory and empowerment evaluation were described in the first and second empowerment evaluation books, they recommended Cousins' tool to highlight the differences, focusing on depth of participation and control of evaluation technical decision making{{sfn|Fetterman|2001|p=113}}

The most significant response to the critiques focused on outcomes. Fetterman &amp; Wandersman argued that outcomes and results were important to EE. They highlighting specific project outcomes including:

====Outcomes====
*CDC funded a study using a quasi-experimental design that demonstrated improved outcomes as a result of empowerment evaluation.{{sfn| (Chinman, et al.|2008}}
*Empowerment evaluation used in Arkansas distressed schools, increased standardized test scores.
*Native American's built a wireless system and digital printing press supported by empowerment evaluation.
* Stanford University's School of Medicine used EE to prepare for an accreditation site visit. Increases in student course ratings were statistically significant.{{sfn|Fetterman|Deitz|Gesundheit|2010}}
*Arkansas save millions in excess medical costs from applying empowerment evaluation to tobacco prevention programs. This resulted in legislation creating the Arkansas Evaluation Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Fetterman |url=http://arkansasevaluationcenter.blogspot.com/ |title=Arkansas Evaluation Center |publisher=Arkansasevaluationcenter.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fetterman|Wandersman|2007}}

====Scriven's assessment====

Scriven agreed that external evaluators sometimes miss problems obvious to program staff members. He also stated they have less credibility with them than an internal evaluator. As a result, he concluded, it is less likely their recommendations will be implemented.{{sfn|Scriven|1997|p=12}}

Scriven agreed that EE contributed to improvements in internal staff program evaluations and that empowerment evaluation could make a contribution to evaluation if combined with third-party evaluation.{{sfn|Scriven|1997|p=174}}

==Professional association affiliation and awards==

Empowerment evaluation was a catalyst for the creation of the [[American Evaluation Association]]'s Collaborative, Participatory, and Empowerment Evaluation topical interest group. Approximately 20% of the American Evaluation Association membership is affiliated with the topical interest group.{{sfn|Rodriguez-Campos|2012}} [[SAGE Publications]], a social science textbook publisher, cited an empowerment evaluation book as one of their "classic titles in research methods."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagepub.com/repository/binaries/pdfs/HistoryofMethods.pdf ''How SAGE has shaped Research Methods''], p.&amp;nbsp;12. SAGE Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Four empowerment evaluators received honors from the association: Margret Dugan, David Fetterman, Shakeh Kaftarian, and Abraham Wandersman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patton|1997a|p=148}} [http://www.eval.org/aboutus/awards/CallForAwards/aea.PastAwardWinners.asp American Evaluation Association Award Recipients]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service''' ({{lang-et|Välisluureamet}}) is the foreign intelligence service of the Republic of Estonia. The Foreign Intelligence Service coordinates with all Estonian intelligence functions, collects intelligence concerning foreign interests and activities, and transmits information to the [[President of the Republic of Estonia|President]], [[Prime_Minister_of_Estonia|Prime Minister]], the [[General Staff of the Estonian Defence Forces]], the [[Minister_of_the_Interior_and_Regional_Affairs_(Estonia)|Interior Minister]], the [[Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Estonia)|Foreign Minister]], and the [[Military_of_Estonia|Minister of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Office|url=http://www.postimees.ee/teema/teabeamet|website=[[Postimees|Postimees.ee]] |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of| March 2016}} the Director General of the Foreign Intelligence Service is [[Mikk Marran]].

== History ==
Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service was first formed in 1992 as Intelligence Service (''Eesti Vabariigi Riigikantselei Teabeteenistus''). In 2001 service was reformed under the Security Authorities Ac as Estonian Information Board (''Teabeamet''). On July 1 2017, it was renamed again as Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.valisluureamet.ee/ Välisluureamet]. 2 August 2017. (in Estonian)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The stated mission of the Foreign Intelligence Service is to ensure Estonia’s national security and to maintain constitutional order through non-military preventative measures. The Foreign Intelligence Service collects intelligence concerning foreign countries, developments and events abroad needed for the formulation of foreign, economic, and defence policy; performs counterintelligence functions for the protection of Estonian diplomatic missions and defence units stationed abroad; organizes and monitors the implementing of measures adopted for the security of electronically transmitted information; and organizes and verifies information security and special communications services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 Estonian National Security Concept|url=http://www.libertysecurity.org/IMG/pdf/National_Security_Concept_2004.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Libertysecurity.org|accessdate=2015-05-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073916/http://www.libertysecurity.org/IMG/pdf/National_Security_Concept_2004.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-18|dead-url=Yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Authorities Act|url=https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/514112013020/consolide|publisher=Riigiteataja.ee|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs|url=http://www.coe.int/t/E/Com/Files/Events/2006-CIA/annexes2/Estonie.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Coe.int|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hierarchy ==
The Foreign Intelligence Service is directly subordinate to Estonia’s Ministry of Defence. The Republic of Estonia has not identified any subordinate agencies to or divisions within the Foreign Intelligence Service, however the agency closely coordinates with the Estonian Internal Security Service, Estonian Defence Forces, the Estonian Security Police Board, all other local government agencies, foreign security agencies, international organizations, and individuals of interest on matters concerning external intelligence and counterintelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Ministry of Defence Hierarchy|url=http://www.kaitseministeerium.ee/en/ministry-of-defencepublisher=Kaitseministeerium.ee|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oversight===
On 4 April 2015, The Security Authorities Surveillance Select Committee of the Riigikogu was formed under § 36 of the Security Authorities Act to verify the lawfulness of the activity and surveillance activities of the Internal Security Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service. The Committee is responsible for overseeing the activities of the Foreign Intelligence Service to ensure compliance with the Estonian Code of Criminal Procedure, as well as with the procedure for registration and disclosure of persons who have served in or co-operated with security organizations or intelligence or counterintelligence organizations of armed forces of states which have occupied Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Authorities Surveillance Select Committee|url=http://www.riigikogu.ee/en/parliament-of-estonia/committees/security-authorities-surveillance-select-committee/publisher=Riigikogu.ee|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current members of the Security Authorities Surveillance Select Committee are Krista Aru, Uno Kaskpeit, Martin Kukk, Erki Savisaar, Ken-Marti Vaher and Hardi Volmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitutional Committee initiated the forming of the Security Authorities Surveillance Select Committee|url=http://www.riigikogu.ee/en/news-from-committees/security-authorities-surveillance-select-committee/the-constitutional-committee-initiated-the-forming-of-the-security-authorities-surveillance-select-committee|publisher=Riigikogu.ee|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
In April 2015, the Foreign Intelligence Service issued Estonia's Ministers specially encrypted iPhones after revelations that calls between Former Foreign Minister Urmas Paet and the then European Union Foreign Affairs and Security Policy High Representative Catherine Ashton were recorded and uploaded to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Ministers Got Encrypted iPhones|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/Technology/?doc=105015|publisher=Baltic-course.com|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, data leaks from the customer support database of Gamma Group, the producer of one of the world's most powerful surveillance software systems, showed that the software was being used in Estonia, most likely by the Foreign Intelligence Service and other intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaks show Estonian law enforcement agencies may be using FinFisher|url=http://www.balticbusinessnews.com/article/2014/8/14/leaks-show-estonian-law-enforcement-agencies-may-be-using-finfisher|publisher=Balticbusinessnews.com|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014 corruption probe==
In May 2014, the Estonian Internal Security Service opened a criminal investigation into accusations of embezzlement and revealing state secrets by five members of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergei Bõstrov, Pavel Kotkin, Ines Piibeleht, Sven Randlane and Lauri Vihula. Few details concerning the case were revealed, however it was revealed that all five members served in the same unit, led by Sergei Bõstrov. The funds in question, which were allocated for the purchase of information, were taken during the period of 2002–2014 and the state secrets revealed were deemed as having been "revealed to third parties who had no need for classified state information," however did not threaten Estonia's national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Board Asks ISS to Investigate its Staff in Possible Embezzlement Case|url=http://news.err.ee/v/main_news/9a35dda1-c90e-4164-8608-1a8e3d66c74b|publisher=News.err.ee|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All were found guilty of embezzling a combined total of more than 600,000 euros, four of the five were also found guilty of revealing state secrets, and Sergei Bõstrov was found guilty of handling a small amount of cocaine. Bõstrov was given a four-year, six-month prison sentence, Kotkin spent 11 months in jail with a three-year suspended sentence, Randlane and Piibeleht were both imprisoned for a little over six months with a longer suspended sentence, and Vihula escaped incarceration but served a two-year, seven-month suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Secret Service Staff Handed Jail Terms For Embezzlement|url=http://news.err.ee/v/society/6d1804db-535c-448e-8856-30f36f5a10af|publisher=News.err.ee|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nerva Fiscus Iudaicus coin.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A coin issued by [[Nerva]] reads ''fisci Judaici [[calumnia (Roman law)|calumnia]] sublata'', "abolition of [[malicious prosecution]] in connection with the Jewish tax"&lt;ref&gt;As translated by Molly Whittaker, ''Jews and Christians: Graeco-Roman Views'', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''{{lang|la|fiscus Iudaicus}}''''' ([[Latin]] for "Jewish tax") or '''''{{lang|la|fiscus Judaicus}}''''' was a tax-collecting agency instituted to collect the [[Roman Empire#Taxation|tax]] imposed on [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jews in the Roman Empire]] after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple in AD 70]]. Revenues were directed to the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

==Contemporary sources==
Modern knowledge of the fiscus Judaicus is found in four [[primary source]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-fiscus-judaicus-and-the-parting-of-the-ways/ The Fiscus Judaicus and the Parting of the Ways], reviewed by Shaye J.D. Cohen, 10/10/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* A passage from ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]''
* A passage from [[Cassius Dio]]'s ''Roman History''

==Imposition==
{{Taxation}}
The tax was initially imposed by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Vespasian]] as one of the [[Anti-Judaism|measures against Jews]] as a result of the [[First Roman-Jewish War]] of 66–73 AD (first Jewish revolt) (Josephus ''BJ'' 7. 218; Dio Cassius 66.7.2). The tax was imposed on all Jews throughout the empire, not just on those who took part in the revolt against Rome. The tax was imposed after the [[destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 AD in place of the levy (or [[Tithe]]) payable by Jews towards the upkeep of the Temple. The amount levied was two [[denarius|denarii]], equivalent to the one-half of a [[shekel]] that observant Jews had previously paid for the upkeep of the Temple of Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Exodus|30:13|HE}}). The tax was to go instead to the [[Temple of Capitoline Jupiter]], the major center of [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. The ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was a humiliation for the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6157-fiscus-judaicus Jewish Encyclopedia: Fiscus Judaicus]: "This was an affront to Jewish religious feeling."&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, a special [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] known as ''procurator ad capitularia Iudaeorum'' was responsible for the collection of the tax.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"&gt;"Fiscus Judaicus", ''Encyclopedia Judaica''&lt;/ref&gt; Only those who had abandoned Judaism were exempt from paying it.

While the tax paid for the Temple of Jerusalem was payable only by adult men between the ages of 20 and 50, the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was imposed on all Jews, including women, children, and elderly&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer (1998), pp. 113&amp;ndash;114&lt;/ref&gt;—and even Jewish slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Heemstra, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Egypt]], the documentary evidence (in the form of receipts) confirms the payment of the tax by women and children. The oldest person known from these receipts to have paid the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was a 61-year-old woman, which led Sherman LeRoy Wallace to conjecture that the tax was levied only until the age of 62, as was the regular [[Roman Empire#Taxation|Roman poll tax]] paid by individuals throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Heemstra, p. 14 (footnote n. 30)&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was continued even after the completion of the reconstruction of the Capitoline temple for its upkeep.

==Domitian==
[[Domitian]], who ruled between 81 and 96 AD, expanded the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' to include not only born Jews and [[Conversion to Judaism|converts to Judaism]], but also on those who concealed the fact that they were Jews or observed Jewish customs. [[Suetonius]] relates that when he was an old man of 90 he was examined to see whether he was [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcised]], which shows that during this period the tax was levied even on those above the age of 62.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"/&gt; [[Louis Feldman]] argues that the increased harshness was caused by the success of the Jewish (and possibly [[Early Christianity|Christian]]) [[proselytism]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (1993), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Domitian applied the tax even to those who merely [[Judaizers|"lived like Jews"]]:

{{quote|Besides other taxes, that on the Jews [A tax of two drachmas a head, imposed by Vespasian; see Josephus, Bell. Jud. 7.218] was levied with the utmost rigor, and those were prosecuted who, without publicly acknowledging that faith, yet lived as Jews, as well as those who concealed their origin and did not pay the tribute levied upon their people [These may have been Christians, whom the Romans commonly assumed were Jews]. I recall being present in my youth when the person of a man ninety years old was examined before the procurator and a very crowded court, to see whether he was circumcised. [{{circa}} 90]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=183&amp;letter=F&amp;search=Fiscus%20Iudaicus Jewish Encyclopedia: Fiscus Iudaicus], [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-domitian-rolfe.html Suetonius's ''Domitian''] XII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Domitian's ruling opened the door to possibilities of [[blackmail]] in Rome and in all [[Italy]]. Charges of following Judaism were easily made, but difficult to disprove, not least because the practices of certain philosophical sects resembled some Jewish customs. As a result, many people chose to settle with the accusers out of court rather than risk the uncertainties of judicial hearings, thus effectively encouraging the blackmailers.&lt;ref&gt;Rodin (1915), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] was put to death for "living a Jewish life" or "drifting into Jewish ways" in the year 95 AD, which may well have been related to the administration of the ''fiscus Judaicus'' under Domitian.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 67.14.1–2, 68.1.2; ''History of the Jewish People'', H.H. Ben-Sasson editor, page 322: "...Domitian ordered the execution of Flavius Clemens ... for [[Judaizing]] tendencies..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schism between Judaism and Christianity==
{{See also|List of events in early Christianity|l1=List of events marking changes in the relations between Christians and Jews in early Christianity}}

The ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was originally imposed on Jews. At the time neither the Romans nor, probably, the [[Early Christian]]s considered Christianity to be a separate religion from Judaism. If anything they would have considered themselves as a sect within Judaism, which historians refer to as [[Jewish Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Bourgel, Jonathan, ″The Jewish Christians and the Jewish tax ″, in: ''From One Identity to Another: The Mother Church of Jerusalem Between the Two Jewish Revolts Against Rome (66-135/6 EC)''. Paris: Éditions du Cerf, collection Judaïsme ancien et Christianisme primitive, (French), pp. 105-125.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether that was the intention or not, it did not take long for Christians to petition the Emperor to distinguish the Christians for the purpose of the payment of the ''fiscus Iudaicus''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} As the tax only applied to practising Jews, if they could be recognised as a separate religion, they would escape the impost.

After the murder of Domitian in 96 AD, [[Nerva]] relaxed the rules of collection, limiting the tax to those who openly practised Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1996), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; By this measure, the Christians (and perhaps [[Jewish Christians]]) escaped the tax [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Ancient/IntergroupTO/Schism.htm]{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}, but they were not officially recognized as a legal religion until the much later [[Edict of Milan]] in 313. The coins of Nerva bear the legend ''fisci Iudaici [[Calumnia (Roman law)|calumnia]] sublata''&lt;ref&gt;"Fiscus Judaicus", ''Encyclopedia Judaica''; Rodin (1915), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; "abolition of [[malicious prosecution]] in connection with the Jewish tax,"&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Molly Whittaker, ''Jews and Christians: Graeco-Roman Views'', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to his reform of the harsh policies of [[Domitian]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Goodman (historian)|Martin Goodman]], "Nerva, the ''Fiscus Judaicus'' and Jewish Identity," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 79 (1989) 40–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==

It remains unclear when exactly the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was abolished. Documentary evidence confirms the collection of the tax in the middle of the 2nd century, and literary sources indicate that the tax was still in existence in the early 3rd century. It is not known when the tax was formally abolished. Some historians credit the emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] with its abolition in about 361 or 362.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/julian-jews.html Julian and the Jews (361-363 CE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval revival ==

The tax was revived in the [[Middle Ages]] in 1342 under the name of [[Opferpfennig]] by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. The Opferpfennig (originally Guldenpfennig) tax was introduced in 1342 by Emperor [[Louis IV the Bavarian]], who ordered all Jews above the age of 12 and possessing 20 gulden to pay one gulden annually for protection. The practice was justified on the grounds that the emperor, as the legal successor of the Roman emperors, was the rightful recipient of the [[Taxation of the Jews|Temple tax]] which Jews paid to the Romans after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]]. The Opferpfennig was collected on [[Christmas]] day.

Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] later ordered the income of the Opferpfennig tax to be delivered to the archbishop of [[Trier]]. This tax was at some places replaced by an overall communal tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15120.html OPFERPFENNIG.

'''Forced circumcision''' refers to [[circumcision]] of [[man|males]] who have not given their [[consent]] to the procedure. In a [[Bible|biblical]] context, the term is used especially in relation to [[Paul the Apostle]] and his [[polemic]]s against the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|forced circumcision of gentile Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Dunn, ''Paul and the Mosaic Law'', p. 265; Tomson, "Transformations of Post-70 Judaism," p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Among adults, forced circumcisions have occurred in a wide range of situations, most notably in the [[Forced conversion to Islam|compulsory conversion of non-Muslims to Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;"Although the Qur'an speaks against forced conversion, such conversions of Christians and Jews took place under Muslim rule until the early decades of the twentieth century." Lerner, ''Religion, Secular Beliefs and Human Rights'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; and the forced circumcision of [[Teso people|Teso]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]] and [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] men in [[Kenya]], as well as the abduction of [[South Africa]]n teenage boys to so-called circumcision schools ("bush schools").&lt;ref&gt;On occurrences of forced circumcision in Kenya, see Glazier, ''Land and the Uses of Traditions'', p. 25; Wamwere, ''I Refuse to Die'', p. 149, passim; Karimi and Ochieng, ''The Kenyatta Succession'', p. 13; Rutten and Owuor, "Weapons of mass destruction"; Kagwanja, "Courting genocide." Regarding the situation in South Africa, see Ndangam, ''Lifting the Cloak'', pp. 211-213; Meintjies, ''Manhood at a Price''; Mayatula and Mavundla, "A review on male circumcision procedures"; Crowly and Kesner, "Ritual Circumcision."&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, custom allows uncircumcised [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]-speaking men past the age of circumcision (i.e., 25 years or older) to be overpowered by other men and forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Funani, ''Circumcision among the Ama-Xhosa'', p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and contemporary forced circumcision==

===Hasmonean Kingdom (140 BCE–37 BCE)===
{{see also|Hasmonean Kingdom}}
[[1 Maccabees]] relates the story of how [[Mattathias]] (ca. 166 BC) forcibly circumcised the sons of [[Jews|Jewish]] parents who had abandoned the rite.&lt;ref&gt;"And Mattathias and his friends went around and tore down the altars; they forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys that they found within the borders of Israel " (1 Macc. 2:45-46, New Revised Standard Version).&lt;/ref&gt; Forced circumcision of Gentiles by Jews is attested from the second century BC onwards. In 125 BC [[John Hyrcanus]] conquered [[Edom]], which the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] called Idumea; and the Idumeans were converted to Judaism. As reported by [[Josephus]], circumcision was required of the Idumeans as a token of their acceptance of Judaism:

{{blockquote|Hyrcanus took also Dora and Marissa, cities of Idumea, and subdued all the Idumeans; and permitted them to stay in that country, if they would circumcise their genitals, and make use of the laws of the Jews; and they were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers, that they submitted to the use of circumcision, and the rest of the Jewish ways of living; at which time therefore this befell them, that they were hereafter no other than Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIII 9:1, 254 ff; see, e.g., Cohen, ''The Beginnings of Jewishness'', pp. 110-111; Taus, ''Torah for Today'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars disagree on the interpretation of the sources. For example, Steven Weitzman believes the Idumeans were forcibly circumcised for political, not religious, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, "Forced Circumcision."&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Shaye J. D. Cohen]], "[[Ptolemy]]'s claim, that the Idumaeans were compelled to be circumcised and to adopt Jewish ways, is a simplified account of what these urban Idumaeans experienced."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, "Religion, Ethnicity, and Hellenism," p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;
During the short reign of Hyrcanus' eldest son, [[Aristobulus I]] (104-103 BC), the [[Hasmonean]]s gained control of [[Galilee]]. In this case, too, sources indicate that the residents were subjected to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Fiensy, ''New Testament Introduction'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence suggests that, during this period, Gentiles fled from Galilee to avoid being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, "Why Evaluate Twenty-five Years," pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
{{see also|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}
Greeks and Romans regarded circumcision as a mutilation of the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|male genitalia]], but the practice is little discussed in [[Latin literature|Roman literary sources]] until the second century of the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal 14.103–104; [[Tacitus]], ''Historia'' 5.5.1–2; Martial 7.30.5, 7.35.3–4, 7.82.5–6, 11.94; Margaret Williams, "Jews and Jewish Communities in the Roman Empire," in ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 325; Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian'' (Brill, 1976), p. 431; Jack N. Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Religion," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy in Early Christianity]] but this was resolved at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] c.50 which made it clear that circumcision of gentile converts to Christianity was not required.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 15: 5-21&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus (who changed his allegiance from the Jews to the Roman [[Flavians]]) reports that two Roman officers who had taken refuge with Galileans during the war with Rome (early 67 AD) were put under pressure to convert to Judaism. Josephus, declaring that "every one should worship God in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience," claims to have saved the two Gentiles from forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Life'' 23 §113; see also Goodman, "Galilean Judaism," p. 602; Donaldson, ''Paul and the Gentiles'', p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First Roman-Jewish War]], a head tax, the [[Fiscus Judaicus]], was levied against all Jews. According to [[Suetonius]], [[Domitian]] (c.90) also applied this tax to those who were circumcisied, even if they claimed they were not Jews. [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)]] was put to death in 95 for adopting Jewish customs. In 96 [[Nerva]] relaxed the Jewish tax as applying only to those who professed to be Jews. Sometime between 128 and 132 AD, the emperor [[Hadrian]] seems to have temporarily banned circumcision, on pain of death.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World'' (Routledge, 1983, 2003), p. 150, and ''Judeophobia: Attitudes toward Jews in the Ancient World'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), p. 103, pointing out this depends on a single note on the ban as a cause for the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', the historical credibility of which is often cast in doubt. [[Cassius Dio]] mentions nothing about circumcision in his account of the revolt. See also Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', pp. 430–431, who thinks the ban makes more sense as a punitive measure after the revolt, since it "ran completely counter to the long established Roman policy of guaranteeing Jewish religious liberty."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoninus Pius]] exempted Jews from the ban,&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews'', p. 150; Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian priests]],&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Origen]] (d. ''ca.'' 253) says that in his time only Jews were permitted to practice circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', p. 103. Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 469, takes Origen as meaning that circumcision was "a solely Jewish rite" by his time.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation under [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the first Christian emperor, freed any slave who was subjected to circumcision; in the year 339, circumcising a slave became punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Greco-Roman writers view circumcision as an identifying characteristic of Jews, they believed the practice to have originated in Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Several Greco-Roman writers, such as [[Strabo]], regarded the Jews as of Egyptian descent, in what was apparently their understanding of [[the Exodus]]: Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded it among peoples they identified as [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Arab]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]], [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]], [[Colchis|Colchian]], and [[History of Ethiopia#Classical Antiquity|Ethiopian]]; circumcision was a marker of "the Other".&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 430; Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora Jews]] might circumcise their male slaves as well as [[Conversion to Judaism|adult male converts]] and Jewish male infants.&lt;ref&gt;Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Judaism," p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Catherine Hezser, it is an open question whether Jews of [[late antiquity]] refrained from forcibly circumcising their Gentile slaves and whether Romans avoided selling their slaves to Jews in reaction to the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, ''Jewish Slavery in Antiquity'', p. 42; see also Hezser, "Slaves and Slavery."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishnah]] (compiled about 200 AD) is silent on this point, whereas the [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael]] (written at the end of the fourth century or later) suggests that Jews might indeed possess uncircumcised slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, ''Jews and Blacks'', p. 378, n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia and North Africa===
Forced conversions, involving forced circumcision, are echoed in a vast body of [[scholarly method|scholarly]] literature spanning the entire history of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lerner, ''Religion, Secular Beliefs, and Human Rights'', p. 142; Ye'or, ''The Decline of Eastern Christianity'', pp. 88-91; Stark, ''God's Battalions'', p. 28; Clarence-Smith, ''Islam'', p. 39, passim; Misra, ''Identity and Religion'', p. 91, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars conclude that, during the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Islamic conquest of the Middle East and North Africa]], forced conversion to Islam through violence or threat of violence did not play a key role. However, [[tax]]es and regulations requiring the holders of prestigious positions to become Muslims have been regarded as a form of forced conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone, ''An Introduction to Islam'', p. 58; see also Misra, ''Identity and Religion'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Asia====
In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Pollilur|1780 Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British soldiers were held imprisoned by [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] and Tipu Sultan in the fortress of [[Srirangapatna|Seringapatnam]]. Of these, more than 300 were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Darby, ''A Surgical Temptation'', pp. 32-33; see also Oddy, ''Religion in South Asia'', p. 42, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell Massey, who kept a secret diary during his captivity, wrote: "I lost with the foreskin of my yard all those benefits of a Christian and Englishman which were and ever shall be my greatest glory."&lt;ref&gt;Colley, ''Captives'', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolescence|Adolescent]] captives were, in addition to being circumcised, made to wear female clothes. James Bristow, a teenage [[artillery]]man, revenged himself by circumcising [[dog]]s, believing that this would harm the religious feelings of the Muslim warders. The prospect of punishment did not deter him, because "compelling us to undergo an abhorred operation [was] so base and barbarous an act of aggression, that it was impossible to reflect on it with temper."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, ''Captives of Tipu'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Scurry]], also a prisoner of war, confirms in his book, ''The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry'' (1824), that English soldiers, [[Mangalorean Catholics]], and other prisoners were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref name=Bowring&gt;{{cite book

In 1784, when Tipu returned from [[Mangalore]], he brought back tens of thousands of Mangalorean Catholics from [[Kanara]] and subjected them to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Naravane, ''Battles'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; A Hindi idiom 'Mar-mar ke Musalman bana' (meaning 'make Muslim by repeated beating') can be traced to originate from forcible conversion of Hindus.

According to Kativa Daiya, during the 1947 [[partition of India]] "[f]orced circumcision, shaving facial and head hair (for [[Sikh]] men), and shaving off the Hindu [[Brahmin]]'s traditional, short, plaited hair (on an otherwise bald head) were routine Muslim conversion tactics for men and boys."&lt;ref&gt;Daiya, ''Violent Belongings'', pp. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asia News'' reported in 2004 that the Justice and Peace Commission of Lahor spoke out against young non-Muslim men in [[Pakistan]] being converted and circumcised against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Christian-minorities-in-Pakistan:-little-freedom-and-rising-Islamic-pressure-1583.html |title=Christian minorities in Pakistan: little freedom and rising Islamic pressure |date=9 March 2004 |publisher=AsiaNews.it |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the ''Gulf Times'' discussed a case of forced circumcision of [[Nepal]]ese boys in [[Mumbai]] in the context of sex trade in large Indian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Iraq====
[[Iraq]]i [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]], residing almost exclusively in [[Baghdad]] and [[Basra]], do not circumcise.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lupieri, ''The Mandaeans''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their religious sensitivity on this issue has not prevented hostile rulers from subjecting Mandaean men and boys to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, ''The Great Stem of Souls'', pp. 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandaean communities, especially after the invasion of Iraq, have been subject to "murder, kidnapping, rape, forced conversion, forced circumcision and destruction of religious property."&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson et al., "The impact of fear"; see also Nickerson et al., "Fear of Cultural Extinction."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iraq in 2003, shortly after the fall of the Saddam regime, the thirty-five families who made up the Mandean community in Fallujia were ordered at gunpoint to adopt Islam; the men were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabwashingtonian.org/english/article.php?issue=4&amp;articleID=71 |title=The Rape of Basra: Cleansing the Iraqi Mandaeans |author=C.G.

In 2007 the US Committee on International Religious Freedom heard testimony reporting: "Forced conversion is happening in an alarming degree. Boys are being kidnapped, forcibly circumcised - a major sin in the Mandaean religion - and forcibly converted to Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Dr Suhaib Nashi at the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] Hearing on Threats to Iraq's Communities of Antiquity, 25 July 2007; see [http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1268&amp;Itemid=114 USCIRF press release], "USCIRF Hearing: Threats to Iraq's Communities of Antiquity," July 25, 2007 (issued by Judith Ingram).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, after the exodus of the [[Christianity in Iraq|Christians]] from [[Mosul]] and the [[Yazidi|Yazidi's]] from [[Sinjar Mountains|Mount Sinjar]], it was reported that forced circumcisions were taking place conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tunisiadaily.com/2014/08/16/irak-circoncisions-de-chretiens-et-700-femmes-yazidies-vendues-a-150-dollars-piece/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are accounts of Christian boys abducted and forcibly circumcised even in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques, ''The Albanians'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829, 9 year old Greek boy Alexandros Kitos and other young boys were kidnapped by Ottoman soldiers and sold into slavery in Egypt, all were circumcised against their will.&lt;ref&gt;The Greek War of Independence the struggle for freedom from Ottoman oppression pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well established that, before and during the [[Armenian Genocide]], forced conversions (involving forced circumcisions) of [[Armenia]]n boys and men were frequent.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Bobelian, ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; "In many cases young Armenian children were spared from deportation by local Turks who took them from their families. The children were coerced into denouncing Christianity and becoming Muslims, and were then given new Turkish names. For Armenian boys the forced conversion meant they each had to endure painful circumcision as required by Islamic custom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/armenians.htm |title=Armenians in Turkey 1915-1918 1,5000,000 |year=2000 |publisher=The History Place |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====
During the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] in September 1955, "many [[Greece|Greek]] men, including at least one [[priest]], were subjected to forced circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;Zayas, "The Istanbul Pogrom"; see also Vryonis, ''The Mechanism of Catastrophe'', pp. 224-226, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the pogrom, the Greek minority eventually emigrated from [[Turkey]]. In 2002 there was a report that non-Muslim army recruits in Turkey had been threatened with forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armenian.ch/gsa/Docs/faae02.pdf |title=Armenians in Turkey Today: A critical assessment of the situation of the Armenian minority in the Turkish Republic |author=Dr Tessa Hofmann |date=October 2002 |publisher= The EU Office of Armenian Associations of Europe|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases are documented where Syro-Orthodox men serving in the Turkish military forces have been threatened with forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Carlier, ''Who Is a Refugee'', pp. 128-129, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, a young Christian Turk, fleeing from forced circumcision in the Turkish military forces, was granted [[Asylum in Germany|asylum in]] [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Zabus, ''Between Rites and Rights'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yazidi]] (not all of whom are circumcised) in Turkey have for years been subjected to direct state persecution, including compulsory religious instruction at school, forced conversion, forced circumcision, and mistreatment during military service.&lt;ref&gt;Carlier, ''Who Is a Refugee'', p. 150, n. 203; see also Jwaideh, ''The Kurdish National Movement'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 there was a report of the forced circumcision of Yedizi men in Turkish Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Violence.htm#_ftn5 |title=The nature and uses of violence in the Kurdish conflict |author=Martin van Bruinessen, Utrecht University |date=July 1999 |work=Paper presented at the International colloquium "Ethnic Construction and Political Violence", organized by the Fondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, Cortona, July 2–3, 1999 |publisher=Universiteit Utrecht |accessdate=3 October 2010 |quote=The Yezidi religious minority has suffered similar but perhaps even more severe forms of oppression than the Christian communities.

====The Arab world====
John Rawlins had sailed for 23 years without incident when, in 1621, he and his crew were kidnapped by pirates from the [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa. Rawlins later reported that, after being taken to Algiers, two younger men were "by force and torment ... compelled ... to turn Turks," which means that they were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, "John Rawlins"; see also DiPiero, ''White Men Aren't'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; By organizing a successful [[mutiny]], he was able to return home in 1622.
The Portuguese Friar Jaono dos Sanctos claimed that, annually in Algiers in the 1620s, more than nine hundred Christian slaves were converted to Islam, "besides about fifty boys yearly circumcised against their wills."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Davis, ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====

=====Maluku Islands=====
Thousands of Christians were forcibly circumcised in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]] from December 1999 to January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, ''Religious Freedom in Asia'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sydney Morning Herald reported in detail on this, stating that "almost all" of 3,928 villagers forced to convert to Islam were circumcised.  Razors and knives were reused, causing infections.&lt;ref name="murdoch-smh"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those circumcised, Kostantinus Idi, reported: "I could not escape," he said. "One of them held up my foreskin between pieces of wood while another cut me with a razor ...the third man held my head back, ready to pour water down my throat if I screamed. But I couldn't help but scream and he poured the water. I kept screaming aloud and vomited. I couldn't stand the pain." He further reported that one of the clerics urinated on his wound, saying it would stop infection. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the forced conversions and forced circumcisions had been condemned by moderate Muslim leaders who said they were contrary to Islamic teachings. The local governor had also investigated the incidents.&lt;ref name="murdoch-smh"/&gt;

===Africa south of the Sahara===

====Ethiopia====
[[Marco Polo]], in his ''Travels'', relates how a Christian king of [[Ethiopia]] took revenge on the Sultan of Aden, who had forcibly circumcised a [[bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Marco Polo'', Book 3, Chapter 35; see also Strickland, ''Saracens, Demons, &amp; Jews'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
In Kenya, most tribes circumcise. Luo men from Western Kenya are a significant exception, for which reason they have regularly been subjected to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Glazier, ''Land and the Uses of Traditions'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2002, following a violent incident in [[Butere/Mumias District]], a district commissioner instructed the police to "crack down on traditional surgeons involved in forcible circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/news/thenation08-23-02/|title=Man Forcibly Circumcised As Crowd Watches|last=|first=|date=2002-08-23|website=|publisher=''The Nation'', Nairobi, Kenya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-10-07|quote=&lt;p&gt;A man was yesterday forcibly circumcised by traditional surgeons in Mumias-Butere District as police watched helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr John Otieko... was cornered by a mob ... stripped naked, frog-marched to a nearby river and covered with clay ... then brought to Mayoni trading centre ... to be circumcised as an excited crowd watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts by four traffic police officers who were manning a roadblock on the highway a few metres away from the scene failed when the crowd started stoning them. The victim was then left bleeding at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;District Commissioner Ernest Munyi expressed shock at the incident and told police to crack down on traditional surgeons involved in forcible circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[Kenyan Human Rights Commission]] announced that it would seek prosecutions against politicians for inciting such violence. In one instance, a cabinet minister had said, "Those who are not circumcised should be taken for a circumcision ceremony." The Commission said this amounted to an incitement to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In late January 2008, a disputed election in which circumcision became an issue between President Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu and opposition candidate Raila Odinga, a Luo, "the fact that Odinga was uncircumcised became an issue: He was seen by some Kikuyus as a 'child' unfit to rule because he had not passed through circumcision and initiation." Post-election violence reportedly "focused on tribal animosities", and included several cases of forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In September 2010, at Malaba, West Kenya, a 21-year-old Teso man was lured to a hotel, drugged, smeared with fermented millet flour and was being led away by several Bukusu to be circumcised when the police intervened. The Teso man, who agreed to a medical circumcision, condemned the Bukusu youths for trying to impose their culture on the Teso. Three weeks previously, village neighbours in Aedomoru sub location in Teso north armed themselves with clubs and prevented a 35-year-old man from being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====South Africa====
In 1999, a woman who was feared throughout the Vaal Triangle district of South Africa, controlled a gang of kidnappers that abducted young people, forcibly circumcising the boys and extorting ransoms from their parents for their release. A local police officer said as many as 10 teenagers had been snatched every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In December 2004, 45-year-old Nceba Cekiso was caught and circumcised against his will. The report in the ''[[Cape Argus]]'' noted, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Xhosa culture allows people to forcibly circumcise boys deemed to be past the age of initiation... Forcing people do undergo the ancient ritual ... has, in recent times, caused concern among human rights organisations... (In) one instance two Rastafarians objected to the procedure on religious grounds. The incident has sparked a debate on whether or not traditionalists should still be allowed to force people against their will into the bush to undergo initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite being medically circumcised, a Christian Xhosa was forcibly recircumcised by his father and community leaders in 2007. He laid a charge of unfair discrimination on the grounds of his religious beliefs, seeking an apology from his father and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. In the settlement that was reached, and which was made an order of the Equality Court, the Congress of Traditional Leaders accepted the right of adult males to choose whether to attend traditional circumcision schools according to their religious beliefs. It apologised for the comments made by its former chairman encouraging the ostracism of teenagers who refused to undergo traditional circumcision. The judge declared, "What is important in terms of the Constitution and law is that no one can be forced to submit to circumcision without his consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Sudan====
There is ample evidence that, for years, Christians of [[Khartoum]] and elsewhere in [[Sudan]] have been forcefully converted to Islam, and that Christian men and boys have been forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3df4bea71c.html "Sudan: Reports of Catholic residents of Khartoum or elsewhere in Sudan being forcefully converted to Islam"], Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 19 October 2001, and references therein; see also Akol, ''Burden of Nationality'', pp. 25-72. According to the ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000'', February 2001 (United States Department of State, Washington, DC), non-Muslim Sudanese boys kidnapped off the streets have undergone forced circumcision in government camps and juvenile houses; see {{cite web

====Uganda====
In 1885, [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Kabaka Mwanga]] ordered the murders of Bishop [[James Hannington]] and many local Christians. During the following period, Islamization led to several Christians being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Otiso, ''Culture and Customs of Uganda'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed by [[anthropology|anthropologist]] Suzette Heald and other scholars, the [[Gisu people|Gisu]] (alternatively, Bagishu) of [[Uganda]] "take pride in not tolerating uncircumcised men." For this reason, in Gisu society, any boy or man who has been able to escape ritual circumcision (called "imbalu") faces the prospect of being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, ''Manhood and Morality'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Voice of America, referring to the same practice, reports: "Among the Bagishu, uncircumcised men are treated with contempt; they are not allowed in society and in most cases they are seen as failing to get local women for marriage. This is supported by all the Bagishu including women who often report uncircumcised men to tribal elders. It's considered traditional that no male is to escape the ritual regardless of where he lives, what he does or what kind of security he has."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Australia===
Traditional circumcision is still practised in some tribal areas of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., DeMello, ''Encyclopedia'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist and anthropologist Peter Sutton, commenting on forced circumcision and the absence of law enforcement in remote settlements, claims that Australian law has been applied in a patchy way: "Involuntary circumcision has long been widely accepted as being de facto outside the scope of Australian law."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, ''The Politics of Suffering'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1996, 34-year-old Irwin Brookdale was drinking with a group of [[Australian Aborigines]] on the banks of a river in far north Queensland. After he passed out, a woman in the group felt down his pants, found that he was not circumcised and called on her companions to "make a man out of him." They attempted to circumcise him with a broken beer bottle. Brookdale ended up in hospital, one of his assailants was convicted of unlawful wounding and Brookdale was awarded A$10,000 compensation for nervous shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Breakup of Yugoslavia====
The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], according to Milica Z. Bookman, "was extremely violent, producing some two million refugees, over 100,000 killed, and evidence of gang rape, impaling, dismemberment and forced circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;Bookman, "War and Peace."&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Department of State reported that Muslim and Mujahedin irregular troops  "had routinely performed crude, disfiguring, nonmedical circumcisions on Bosnian Serb soldiers." One 18-year-old Bosnian Serb soldier "was so brutally circumcised that eventually the entire organ required amputation."&lt;ref&gt;''Fourth Report on War Crimes in the Former Yugoslavia: Part II—Torture of Prisoners'', US Department of State Dispatch, vol. 3, no. 52, 28 December 1992, quoted in Kohlmann, ''Al-Qaida's Jihad in Europe'', p. 30.

The '''French demonstration of 15 May 1848''' was an event played out, mostly, in the streets of Paris. It was intended to reverse the results of a [[French Second Republic|Second-Republic]] election of deputies to the Constituent Assembly. It is difficult to say, with any precision, whether this phenomenon should be called a ''demonstration'', a ''riot'', an ''invasion'', or an ''attempted coup d'état''. Nonetheless, it seems to have been largely unplanned, not particularly bloody, and indisputably a failure.

==Context==
The election results of 23 April 1848, which chose deputies to serve in the national Constituent Assembly, were very unfavorable to republican progressives, a party that held strong socialistic views such as wanting the government to be the "supreme regulator of production" and led by the "utopian socialist" [[Louis Blanc]].&lt;ref name="fordham"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1840blanc.html|title=Modern History Sourcebook:Louis Blanc:The Organisation of Labour,1840|publisher=University of Cincinnati 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal male suffrage, applied for the first time since 1792, resulted in the election of an Assembly with a majority composed of a group calling themselves "tomorrow's republicans". A new government was elected by the Assembly, called the ''Commission exécutive de la République française'' (Executive Committee of the French Republic), which was composed largely of moderate Republicans who were opposed to the socialistic agenda enacted by the provisional government that had been in place since the February 1848 revolution. 

Once assembled, the deputies tried to insulate themselves from the inevitable popular pressure engendered by meeting in Paris. Nonetheless, on 10 May, the new assembly spurned the proposal of [[Louis Blanc]] concerning the establishment of a "Ministry of Labor and Progress", a bold measure that aimed to implement Blanc's socialist agenda. Blanc was opposed to the free markets and market competition and wanted the "Ministry of Labor and Progress" to establish communal "workshops" in various industries that all supported each other. The goal was to have government backed labor "workshops" so everyone could have a job and make government the "supreme regulator of production". Blanc claimed that "in destroying competition we strangle at the same time the evils which it brings forth", to which Blanc believed would lead to the downfall of capitalism. The urban laborers behind Blanc were unnerved by the measures taken against him. On 12 May, the Assembly banned political parties and special-interest groups from sending delegations to read petitions to the Assembly, an old practice from revolutionary Paris (1792–1794) and the so-called [[Sans-culottes]], which had been resumed in February 1848. This action was seen by Parisians as undemocratic.&lt;ref name="fordham" /&gt;

The progressives in the Assembly were also unhappy about the inaction of the Department of Foreign Affairs and its provisional minister, [[Jules Bastide]], who refused to help the Poles then under the occupation of Prussian and Austrian troops. The newly elected government, it seemed, was only continuing the foreign policy of the provisional government, a timid and feckless platform, which, under the leadership of [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], had, on 4 March, passed a resolution denying support to ''all'' popular revolutions (in Italy, Poland, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe.) The progressive Republicans had difficulty in understanding this passivity when, within human memory, France had been a "great nation" which marched to the aid of those "oppressed by their rulers."  This was the standard of greatness established by the Revolution of 1792, and many 1848 progressives found France's current passivity painfully disconcerting.

==The demonstration of 15 May==
A ceremony of flags had been scheduled for 14 May 1848, and Paris was full of National Guards, many from the provinces. The ceremony had been suddenly canceled because of the refusal of the delegation of workers sitting in the [[Luxembourg Palace]] to participate in the ceremony. Delegates from [[Poland]] (specifically, [[Poznań]] and [[Lemberg]], now known as [[Lviv]]) prevailed upon a sympathetic deputy from the department of the Seine, a naturalized Pole, [[Louis Wolowski]], to have the Assembly discuss [[Partitions of Poland|the Polish question]] on 15 May. Also on 15 May, Parisian militants, mostly progressive Republicans and socialists, held a demonstration in support of the Polish cause. This happened despite the reluctance of Republican leaders, such as [[François-Vincent Raspail]], [[Armand Barbès]], and [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], to support it.

The event started at the Bastille and headed through the boulevards toward the [[Place de la Concorde]], at the western end of the [[Tuileries Gardens]]. Many foreign delegations (Irish, Italian, Polish) participated. Provocative behavior by fiery old revolutionaries, like [[:fr:Aloysius Huber|Aloysius Huber]], and a general failure by Courtois, the commander of the National Guard, to respond appropriately caused the situation to degenerate.

Protesters headed for the [[Palais Bourbon]], where the Assembly was meeting, and forced their way into the chamber. In the hubbub, someone read the petition in favor of Poland. Then Aloysius Huber exclaimed: "The National Assembly is dissolved." The crowd then marched to the City Hall of Paris, where it proclaimed an "insurrectionary government" with [[Louis Auguste Blanqui|Blanqui]], [[Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin|Ledru-Rollin]], [[Alexandre Martin]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[:fr:Aloysius Huber|Aloysius Huber]], [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger|Thoré]], [[Pierre Leroux]], and [[François-Vincent Raspail|Raspail]] to serve as ministers. However, elements of the National Guard, joined by Lamartine, Ledru-Rollin, and members of the five-day-old Executive Committee, besieged the city hall and dislodged the protesters.

==Consequences of the event==
The Assembly and the Executive Committee resumed control of the situation. The Republican leaders were arrested. They were brought before the [[High Court of Justice of Bourges]] on 7 March to 3 April 1849. [[Marc Caussidière]] was dismissed from his position as prefect of police, and he was replaced by a banker from [[Le Mans]], [[Ariste Jacques Trouvé-Chauvel]]. General de Courtois, commandant of the National Guard of Paris, who had shown some sympathy for the protesters, was arrested and replaced by General [[:fr:Clément Thomas|Clément Thomas]]. [[Jules Favre]] tried in vain to get the Assembly to indict Louis Blanc. [[Philippe Buchez]], who had shown no reaction to the demonstrators, lost the presidency of the Assembly, and he was succeeded by the former attorney, [[Antoine Sénard]]. The Conservatives were, after these events, free to carry on the offensive against their great nemesis: the national workshops associated with Louis Blanc.

The '''history of socialism''' has its origins in the 1789 [[French Revolution]] and the changes which it wrought, although it has precedents in earlier movements and ideas. ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' was written by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1848 just before the [[Revolutions of 1848]] swept Europe, expressing what they termed "[[scientific socialism]]". In the last third of the 19th century, [[Social Democratic Party|social democratic parties]] arose in Europe, drawing mainly from [[Marxism]]. The [[Australian Labor Party]] was the world's first elected socialist party when it formed government in the [[Colony of Queensland]] for a week in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blainey|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Blainey|title=A shorter history of Australia|publisher=Vintage|year=2000|location=Milsons Point, N.S.W. P|isbn=1-74051-033-X|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Communist party|communist parties]] of the [[Third International]] around the world mainly came to represent socialism in terms of the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet model of economic development]] and the creation of [[Planned economy|centrally planned economies]] directed by a state that owns all the means of production, although other trends condemned what they saw as the lack of democracy. In the United Kingdom, [[Herbert Morrison]] said that "[[socialism]] is what the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government does" whereas [[Aneurin Bevan]] argued that socialism requires that the "main streams of economic activity are brought under public direction", with an economic plan and workers' democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Bevan, Aneurin, ''In Place of Fear'', p. 50, p. 126-128. MacGibbon and Kee, (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; Some argued that capitalism had been abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Crossland]] stated: "[T]o the question 'Is this still capitalism?' I would answer 'No'." In ''The Future of Socialism'' p. 46. Constable (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist governments established the [[mixed economy]] with partial [[nationalisation]]s and social welfare.

By 1968, the prolonged [[Vietnam War]] (1959–1975) gave rise to the [[New Left]], socialists who tended to be critical of the Soviet Union and [[social democracy]]. [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] and some elements of the New Left and others favored [[Decentralized planning|decentralized]] [[collective ownership]] in the form of [[cooperatives]] or [[workers' councils]]. At the turn of the 21st century in Latin America, [[Venezuela]]n President [[Hugo Chávez]] championed what he termed [[socialism of the 21st century]], which included a policy of nationalisation of national assets such as [[Petroleum|oil]], [[anti-imperialism]] and termed himself a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] supporting [[permanent revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6246219.stm "Chavez accelerates on path to socialism"], BBC News, 10 January 2007, retrieved 8 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of socialism==
The [[Book of Acts]] describes an early Christian socialist community that shared a common purse:
::All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 4:32&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mazdak]] (died c. 524 or 528 [[Common Era|CE]]) preached and instituted a religion-based socialist or proto-socialist system in the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] context of [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] Persia.&lt;ref&gt;

In Britain, [[Thomas Paine]] proposed a detailed plan to tax property owners to pay for the needs of the poor in ''[[Agrarian Justice]]''&lt;ref&gt;Paine, Thomas (2004). Common sense [with] Agrarian justice. Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-101890-9}}. pp. 92–3.&lt;/ref&gt; (1797), while [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] wrote ''The Effects of Civilization on the People in European States'' (1805), denouncing capitalism's effects on the poor of his time.&lt;ref name="Blaug 1986 358"&gt;{{cite book| last = Blaug | first = Mark | title = Who's Who in Economics: A Biographical Dictionary of Major Economists 1700-1986 | publisher = The MIT Press | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-262-02256-7| page = 358}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English word "socialist" in its modern sense dates from at least 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|socialist}}: "1822 E.Cowper ''Let. to Robert Owen'' 2 Nov. in ''Revue d'Histoire Economique &amp; Sociale'' (1957) 35 80 [She] seems well adapted to become what my friend Jo. Applegath calls a Socialist".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chartism]], which flourished from 1838 to 1858, "formed the first organized labour movement in Europe, gathering significant numbers around the People's Charter of 1838, which demanded the extension of suffrage to all male adults. Prominent leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first trade unions and consumers’ cooperative societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement, as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands".&lt;ref&gt;Nik Brandal, Øivind Bratberg and Dag Einar Thorsen. ''The Nordic Model of Social Democracy''. Pallgrave-Macmillan. 2013. pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1842, socialism "had become the topic of a major academic analysis" by a German scholar, [[Lorenz von Stein]], in his ''Socialism and Social Movement''.&lt;ref name="George Thomas Kurian 2011"&gt;George Thomas Kurian (ed).

In this period socialism emerged from a diverse array of doctrines and social experiments associated primarily with British and French thinkers—especially Robert Owen, [[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837), [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809-1865), [[Louis Blanc]] (1811–1882) and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825). Early-19th-century followers of the [[utopia]]n theories of such thinkers as [[Robert Owen]], [[Claude Henri de Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]] used the term  "associationism" to describe their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Schumpeter, Joseph|year= 1994, first ed. 1954|title= History of Economic Analysis|pages= 429, 430}}&lt;/ref&gt; These social critics criticized the excesses of poverty and inequality of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and advocated reforms such as the egalitarian distribution of wealth and the transformation of society into small communities in which [[private property]] was to be abolished. Outlining principles for the reorganization of society along [[collectivism|collectivist]] lines, Saint-Simon and Owen sought to build socialism on the foundations of planned, [[utopian]] communities. According to [[Sheldon Richman]], "[i]n the 19th and early 20th centuries, 'socialism' did not exclusively mean collective or government ownership of the means or production but was an umbrella term for anyone who believed labor was cheated out of its natural product under historical capitalism",&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheldon Richman|Richman, Sheldon]], [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/libertarian-left/ Libertarian Left], ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some accounts,{{which|date=July 2016}} the use of the words "socialism" or "communism" related to the perceived attitude toward religion in a given culture. Continental Europeans considered "communism" more atheistic than "socialism". In England, "communism" sounded too close to [[Communion rite|communion]] – with Catholic overtones; hence atheists preferred to call themselves socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Williams|first= Raymond|authorlink= Raymond Williams|title= [[Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society|Keywords: a vocabulary of culture and society]]|publisher= Fontana|year= 1976|isbn= 0-00-633479-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=July 2016}}

By 1847, according to Frederick Engels "Socialism" was "respectable" on the continent of Europe while "Communism" was the opposite as the Owenites in England and the Fourierists in France were considered Socialists, while working-class movements which "proclaimed the necessity of total social change" termed themselves "Communists". This latter trend was "powerful enough" to produce the communism of [[Étienne Cabet]] in France and of [[Wilhelm Weitling]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Frederick, ''Preface to the 1888 English Edition of the ''Communist Manifesto'', p202. Penguin (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-revolutionary period right after the French Revolution of 1789, activists and theorists like [[François-Noël Babeuf]], [[Filippo Buonarroti]] and [[Auguste Blanqui]] influenced the early French labour and socialist movements.&lt;ref name="George Thomas Kurian 2011"/&gt;

===Henri de Saint-Simon===
[[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825), who is called{{by whom|date=July 2016}} the founder of French socialism, argued that a brotherhood of man must accompany the scientific organization of industry and society. He proposed:
* That the state carry out production and distribution
* That allowing everyone to have equal opportunity to develop their talents would lead to social harmony
* That the traditional state could be virtually eliminated, or transformed
* "Rule over men would be replaced by the administration of things"&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Saint Simon''; ''Socialism''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Fourier===
François Marie Charles Fourier (1772–1837) was a French [[utopian socialist]] and philosopher. Modern scholars{{which|date=July 2016}} credit Fourier with having originated the word ''[[Feminism|féminisme]]'' in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGoldstein1982|Goldstein 1982]], p.92.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1808, he had argued in the ''Theory of the Four Movements'' that the extension of the liberty of women was the general principle of all social progress, though he disdained any attachment to a discourse of "equal rights". Fourier inspired the founding of the [[communist]] community called [[La Reunion (Dallas)|La Reunion]] near present-day [[Dallas, Texas]] as well as several other communities within the United States, such as the [[North American Phalanx]] in New Jersey and [[Community Place]] and five others in New York State. Fourierism manifested itself "in the middle of the 19th century (where) literally hundreds of communes (phalansteries) were founded on fourierist principles in France, N. America, Mexico, S. America, Algeria, Yugoslavia, ''etc''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hakim Bey]] (1991) [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__The_Lemonade_Ocean___Modern_Times.html "The Lemonade Ocean &amp; Modern Times"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Owen===

[[File:New Harmony by F. Bate (View of a Community, as proposed by Robert Owen) printed 1838.jpg|thumb|400px|New Harmony, a utopian attempt, depicted as proposed by [[Robert Owen]]]]
Robert Owen (1771–1858) advocated the transformation of society into small, local collectives without such elaborate systems of social organization. Owen managed mills for many years. He transformed life in the village of [[New Lanark]] with ideas and opportunities which were at least a hundred years ahead of their time.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Child labor and corporal punishment were abolished, and villagers were provided with decent homes, schools and evening classes, free health-care, and affordable food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newlanark.org/index2.shtml New Lanark World Heritage Site]. Retrieved 8 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK government's Factory Act of 1833 attempted to reduce the hours adults and children worked in the [[textile industry]]. A fifteen-hour working day was to start at 5.30 a.m. and to cease at 8.30 p.m. Children of nine to thirteen years could work no more than 9 hours, and workers of a younger age were prohibited. There were, however, only four factory inspectors, and factory owners flouted this law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/snapshots/snapshot13/snapshot13.htm The National Archives (UK government records and information management) ''The 1833 Factory Act: did it solve the problems of children in factories?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803121701/http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/snapshots/snapshot13/snapshot13.htm |date=2004-08-03 }}. Retrieved 7 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Owen stated: {{cquote|Eight hours' daily labor is enough for any [adult] human being, and under proper arrangements sufficient to afford an ample supply of food, raiment and shelter, or the necessaries and comforts of life, and for the remainder of his time, every person is entitled to education, recreation and sleep.&lt;ref&gt;From the Foundation Axioms of Owen's "Society for Promoting National Regeneration", 1833&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leaving England for the United States, Robert Owen and his sons began an experiment with a [[socialist community]] in [[New Harmony, Indiana]] in 1825. Advertisements announced the experiment for the [[cooperative]] [[colony]], bringing various people to attempt an [[Eight-hour day|8-hour work-day]] of which Owen was a proponent. The town banned money and other commodities for trade, using "labour tickets" denominated in the number of hours worked.&lt;ref name="clayton"/&gt;

Owen's son, [[Robert Dale Owen]], would say of the failed socialism experiment that the people at New Harmony were "a heterogeneous collection of radicals, enthusiastic devotees to principle, honest [[latitudinarian]]s, and lazy theorists, with a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in".&lt;ref name="clayton"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nuspAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=x2fIRmQvqi&amp;dq=%22a%20heterogeneous%20collection%20of%20radicals%22&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20heterogeneous%20collection%20of%20radicals%22&amp;f=false Robert Owen: Pioneer of Social Reforms] by Joseph Clayton, 1908, A.C. Fifield, London&lt;/ref&gt; The larger community lasted only until 1827, at which time smaller communities were formed, which led to further subdivision, until individualism replaced socialism in 1828. New Harmony dissolved in 1829 due to constant quarrels as parcels of land and property were sold and returned to private use.&lt;ref name="clayton"/&gt;

[[Individualist anarchist]] [[Josiah Warren]], who was one of the original participants in the New Harmony Society, saw the community as doomed to failure due to a lack of individual sovereignty and private property. He wrote of the community: {{cquote|It seemed that the difference of opinion, tastes and purposes increased just in proportion to the demand for conformity. Two years were worn out in this way; at the end of which, I believe that not more than three persons had the least hope of success. Most of the experimenters left in despair of all reforms, and conservatism felt itself confirmed. We had tried every conceivable form of organization and government. We had a world in miniature. --we had enacted the French revolution over again with despairing hearts instead of corpses as a result. ...It appeared that it was nature's own inherent law of diversity that had conquered us ...our 'united interests' were directly at war with the individualities of persons and circumstances and the instinct of self-preservation... and it was evident that just in proportion to the contact of persons or interests, so are concessions and compromises indispensable (''Periodical Letter II'', 1856).
}}

In a ''Paper Dedicated to the Governments of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, France, Prussia and the United States of America'' written in 1841, Owen wrote: "The lowest stage of humanity is experienced when the individual must labor for a small pittance of wages from others".&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Robert, ''Paper Dedicated to the Governments of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, France, Prussia and the United States of America'' London 1841&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pierre-Joseph Proudhon===
[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) pronounced that "property is theft" and that socialism was "every aspiration towards the amelioration of society".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Proudhon termed himself an anarchist and proposed that free association of individuals should replace the coercive state.&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, P.A., 1911, ''Anarchism'', in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 11th-13th editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph, 1851, ''General Idea of the Revolution in the 19th Century'', studies 6 &amp; 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon himself, [[Benjamin Tucker]], and others developed these ideas in a [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] direction, while [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876), [[Peter Kropotkin|Piotr Kropotkin]] (1842–1921), and others adapted Proudhon's ideas in a more conventionally socialist direction. In a letter to Marx in 1846, Proudhon wrote:{{cquote|I myself put the problem in this way: to bring about the return to society, by an economic combination, of the wealth which was withdrawn from society by another economic combination. In other words, through Political Economy to turn the theory of Property against Property in such a way as to engender what you German socialists call community and what I will limit myself for the moment to calling liberty or equality.}}

===Mikhail Bakunin===
[[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876), the father of modern anarchism, was a [[libertarian socialist]], a theory by which the workers would directly manage the means of production through their own productive associations. There would be "equal means of subsistence, support, education, and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity, and equal resources and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor."&lt;ref name=catechism&gt;There would be "equal means of subsistence, support, education, and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity, and equal resources and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor." ''[[Catechism of a Revolutionary]]'', [[Mikhail Bakunin]], 1866&lt;/ref&gt;

While many socialists emphasized the gradual transformation of society, most notably through the foundation of small, utopian communities, a growing number of socialists became disillusioned with the viability of this approach and instead emphasized [[direct action|direct political action]]. Early socialists were united in their desire for a society based on cooperation rather than competition.

==Marxism and the socialist movement==
[[File:Marx-Engels-Forum01.jpg|thumb|300px|Statue of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in Alexanderplatz, Berlin]]
The French Revolution of 1789, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels wrote, "abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property".&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Engels, ''Manifesto of the Communist Party'', p18, Oxford University Press, (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution was preceded and influenced by the works of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], whose ''Social Contract'' famously began: "Man is born free, and he is everywhere in chains".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques, ''Social Contract'', p2, Penguin, (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau is credited with influencing socialist thought, but it was [[François-Noël Babeuf]], and his ''Conspiracy of Equals'', who is credited with providing a model for left-wing and communist movements of the 19th century.

Marx and Engels drew from these socialist or communist ideas born in the French revolution, as well as from the German philosophy of [[Hegel|GWF Hegel]], and English political economy, particularly that of [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. Marx and Engels developed a body of ideas which they called [[scientific socialism]], more commonly called [[Marxism]]. Marxism comprised a theory of history ([[historical materialism]]) as well as a political, economic and philosophical theory.

In the ''[[Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'', written in 1848 just days before the outbreak of the revolutions of 1848, Marx and Engels wrote, "The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property". Unlike those Marx described as [[utopia]]n socialists, Marx determined that "[t]he history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". While utopian socialists believed it was possible to work within or reform capitalist society, Marx confronted the question of the economic and political power of the capitalist class, expressed in their ownership of the means of producing wealth (factories, banks, commerce&amp;nbsp;– in a word, "Capital"). Marx and Engels formulated theories regarding the practical way of achieving and running a socialist system, which they saw as only being achieved by those who produce the wealth in society, the toilers, workers or "proletariat", gaining common ownership of their workplaces, the means of producing wealth.

Marx believed that capitalism could only be overthrown by means of a revolution carried out by the working class: "The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority."&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Engels, ''Manifesto of the Communist Party'', p14, Oxford University Press, (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Marx believed that the proletariat was the only class with both the cohesion, the means and the determination to carry the revolution forward. Unlike the utopian socialists, who often idealised agrarian life and deplored the growth of modern industry, Marx saw the growth of capitalism and an urban proletariat as a necessary stage towards socialism.

For Marxists, socialism or, as Marx termed it, the first phase of communist society, can be viewed as a transitional stage characterized by common or state ownership of the [[means of production]] under democratic workers' control and management, which Engels argued was beginning to be realised in the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, before it was overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;Engels' 1891 postscript to ''The Civil War In France'' by Karl Marx,[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/postscript.htm Marx, Engels, ''Selected works in one volume'', p257], Lawrence and Wishart (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; Socialism to them is simply the transitional phase between [[capitalism]] and "higher phase of communist society". Because this society has characteristics of both its capitalist ancestor and is beginning to show the properties of communism, it will hold the means of production collectively but distributes commodities [[To each the full product of his labor|according to individual contribution]].&lt;ref name="Marx, Karl 1968"&gt;Marx, Karl, ''Critique of the Gotha Programme'', p320-1, Selected Works, Lawrence and Wishart, (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; When the socialist state (the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]) naturally withers away, what will remain is a society in which human beings no longer suffer from alienation and "all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly". Here "society inscribe[s] on its banners: [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!]]"&lt;ref name="Marx, Karl 1968"/&gt; For Marx, a communist society entails the absence of differing [[social class]]es and thus the end of class warfare. According to Marx and Engels, once a socialist society had been ushered in, the state would begin to "wither away"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/index.htm Engels, Frederick, ''Anti-Dühring'', 1877]&lt;/ref&gt; and humanity would be in control of its own destiny for the first time.

==International Workingmen's Association (First International)==
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789–1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W.

Marx was appointed a member of the committee, and according to Saul Padover, Marx and Johann Georg Eccarius, a tailor living in London, became "the two mainstays of the International from its inception to its end".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt; The First International became the first major international forum for the promulgation of socialist ideas.  In 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blin | first = Arnaud | title = The History of Terrorism | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-520-24709-4 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], [[Philadelphes]], English trade unionists, socialists and [[social democrats]].

[[File:Bakunin speaking.png|thumb|175px|[[Mikhail Bakunin]] speaking to members of the [[International Workingmen's Association|IWA]] at the Basel Congress in 1869]]
The [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] was founded in 1869 under the influence of Marx and Engels. In 1875, it merged with the [[General German Workers' Association]] of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] to become what is known today as the [[German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). Socialism became increasingly associated with newly formed [[trade union]]s. In Germany, the SPD founded unions. In Austria, France and other European countries, socialist parties and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] played a prominent role in forming and building up trade unions, especially from the 1870s onwards. This stood in contrast to the British experience, where moderate [[New Model Union]]s dominated the union movement from the mid-nineteenth century, and where trade unionism was stronger than the political labour movement until the formation and growth of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the early twentieth century.

At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Engel | first = Barbara | title = Mothers and Daughters | publisher = Northwestern University Press | location = Evanston | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8101-1740-1 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[centralism|centralist]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref name="bakuninmarx"&gt;"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]" in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year=1991|title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-36973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York.

==Paris Commune==
[[File:Barricade Voltaire Lenoir Commune Paris 1871.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Barricades Boulevard Voltaire, Paris during the uprising known as the Paris Commune]]
In 1871, in the wake of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] an uprising in Paris established the Paris Commune. The [[Paris Commune]] was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. The 92 members of the ''Communal Council'' included a high proportion of skilled workers and several professionals. Many of them were political activists, ranging from reformist republicans, various types of socialists, to the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] who tended to look back nostalgically to the [[French Revolution|Revolution of 1789]].  The "reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised...Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848...and for federation of communes). [[George Woodcock]] manifests that "a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the [[Collectivist anarchism|libertarian collectivists]] Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and [[Elisée Reclus]] and [[Louise Michel]]".&lt;!--ref name="Anarchism 1962"/--&gt; 

The veteran leader of the Blanquist group of revolutionary socialists, [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], was hoped by his followers to be a potential leader of the revolution, but he had been arrested on 17 March and was held in prison throughout the life of the Commune. The Commune unsuccessfully tried to exchange him, first against [[Georges Darboy]], [[Archbishop of Paris]], then against all 74 hostages it detained, but Thiers flatly refused. Some women organized a [[feminism in France|feminist movement]], following on from earlier attempts in 1789 and 1848. Thus, [[Nathalie Lemel]], a socialist bookbinder, and [[Élisabeth Dmitrieff]], a young Russian exile and member of the Russian section of the [[First International]] (IWA), created the ''[[Union des femmes pour la défense de Paris et les soins aux blessés]]'' ("Women's Union for the Defense of Paris and Care of the Wounded") on 11 April 1871. The Women's Union also participated in several municipal commissions and organized cooperative workshops.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2005-03-19/2005-03-19-458756 Women and the Commune], in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', March 19, 2005 {{fr icon}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312190133/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2005-03-19/2005-03-19-458756 |date=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marx and Engels, for a few weeks the Paris Commune provided a glimpse of a socialist society before it was brutally suppressed by the French government.

{{quote|From the outset the Commune was compelled to recognize that the working class, once come to power, could not manage with the old state machine; that in order not to lose again its only just conquered supremacy, this working class must, on the one hand, do away with all the old repressive machinery previously used against it itself, and, on the other, safeguard itself against its own deputies and officials, by declaring them all, without exception, subject to recall at any moment.|author=Engels' 1891 postscript to ''The Civil War In France'' by Karl Marx&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/postscript.htm Marx, Engels, ''Selected works in one volume'', p257], Lawrence and Wishart (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the socialist movement, as the whole of the [[workers' movement]], was decapitated and deeply affected for years.

==The Second International==
As the ideas of Marx and Engels took on flesh, particularly in central Europe, socialists sought to unite in an international organisation. In 1889, on the centennial of the French Revolution of 1789, the [[Second International (politics)|Second International]] was founded, with 384 delegates from 20 countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/secondinternational.html ''The Second (Socialist) International 1889-1923'']. Retrieved 12 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarchist]]s were ejected and not allowed in mainly because of the pressure from marxists.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962). pp. 263–264&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before his death in 1895, Engels argued that there was now a "single generally recognised, crystal clear theory of Marx" and a "single great international army of socialists". Despite its illegality due to the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] of 1878, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]'s use of the limited universal male suffrage were "potent" new methods of struggle which demonstrated their growing strength and forced the dropping of the Anti-Socialist legislation in 1890, Engels argued.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, 1895 Introduction to Marx's ''Class Struggles in France 1848&amp;ndash;1850''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the German SPD obtained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of votes cast. However, before the leadership of the SPD published Engels' 1895 Introduction to Marx's ''Class Struggles in France 1848&amp;ndash;1850'', they removed certain phrases they felt were too revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;cf Footnote 449 in ''Marx Engels Collected Works'' on Engels' 1895 Introduction to Marx's ''Class Struggles in France 1848&amp;ndash;1850''&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx believed that it was possible to have a peaceful socialist transformation in England, although the British ruling class would then revolt against such a victory.&lt;ref&gt;In England, "Insurrection would be madness where peaceful agitation would more swiftly and surely do the work... But, mark me, as soon as it finds itself outvoted on what it considers vital questions, we shall see here a new slaveowners's war." [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/media/marx/71_07_18.htm ''Interview with Karl Marx, Head of L'Internationale, by R. Landor''] New York World, July 18, 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; America and the Netherlands might also have a peaceful transformation, but not in France, where Marx believed there had been "perfected... an enormous bureaucratic and military organisation, with its ingenious state machinery" which must be forcibly overthrown. However, eight years after Marx's death, Engels argued that it was possible to achieve a peaceful socialist revolution in France, too.&lt;ref name="Fischer, Ernst p135"&gt;Fischer, Ernst, ''Marx in his own words'', p135, quoting from Marx, ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The SPD was by far the most powerful of the social democratic parties. Its votes reached 4.5 million, it had 90 daily newspapers, together with trade unions and co-ops, sports clubs, a youth organization, a women's organization and hundreds of full-time officials. Under the pressure of this growing party, [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] introduced limited welfare provision and working hours were reduced. Germany experienced sustained economic growth for more than forty years. Commentators suggest that this expansion, together with the concessions won, gave rise to illusions amongst the leadership of the SPD that capitalism would evolve into socialism gradually.

Beginning in 1896, in a series of articles published under the title "Problems of socialism", [[Eduard Bernstein]] argued that an evolutionary transition to socialism was both possible and more desirable than revolutionary change. Bernstein and his supporters came to be identified as "[[Marxist revisionism|revisionists]]" because they sought to revise the [[classical Marxism|classic tenets of Marxism]]. Although the [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxists]] in the party, led by [[Karl Kautsky]], retained the Marxist theory of revolution as the official doctrine of the party, and it was repeatedly endorsed by SPD conferences, in practice the SPD leadership became increasingly [[reformist]].

===Russia===
Bernstein coined the aphorism: "The movement is everything, the final goal nothing". But the path of reform appeared blocked to the Russian Marxists while Russia remained the bulwark of reaction. In the preface to the 1882 Russian edition to the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels had saluted the Russian Marxists who, they said, "formed the vanguard of revolutionary action in Europe". But the working class, although many were organised in vast modern western-owned enterprises, comprised no more than a small percentage of the population and "more than half the land is owned in common by the peasants". Marx and Engels posed the question: How was Russia to progress to socialism? Could Russia "pass directly" to socialism or "must it first pass through the same process" of capitalist development as the West? They replied: "If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a [[proletarian revolution]] in the West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Engels, ''Preface to the Russian Edition of 1882'', Communist Manifesto, p196, Penguin Classics, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] began to split on ideological and organizational questions into [[Bolshevik]] ('Majority') and [[Menshevik]] ('Minority') factions, with Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]] leading the more radical Bolsheviks. Both wings accepted that Russia was an economically backward country unripe for socialism. The Mensheviks awaited the capitalist revolution in Russia. But Lenin argued that a revolution of the workers and peasants would achieve this task. After the Russian revolution of 1905, [[Leon Trotsky]] argued that unlike the French revolution of 1789 and the European Revolutions of 1848 against absolutism, the capitalist class would never organise a revolution in Russia to overthrow absolutism, and that this task fell to the working class who, liberating the peasantry from their feudal yoke, would then immediately pass on to the socialist tasks and seek a "permanent revolution" to achieve international socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Trotsky, Leon, ''The Permanent Revolution and Results and Prospects'', p169ff. New Park, (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Assyrian nationalist [[Freydun Atturaya]] tried to create regional self-government for the [[Assyrian people]] with the socialism ideology. He even wrote the [[Urmia Manifesto of the United Free Assyria]]. However, his attempt was put to an end by [[Cheka|Soviet Secret Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A Man Before His Time (2015)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4231442/plotsummary|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1877, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] was founded. This party, which advocated Marxism and still exists today, was a confederation of small Marxist parties and came under the leadership of [[Daniel De Leon]]. In 1901, a merger between opponents of De Leon and the younger [[Social Democratic Party (United States)|Social Democratic Party]] joined with [[Eugene V. Debs]] to form the [[Socialist Party of America]]. In 1905, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] formed from several independent [[labor unions]]. The IWW opposed the political means of Debs and De Leon, as well as the [[craft unionism]] of [[Samuel Gompers]]. In 1910, the [[Sewer Socialists]], the main group of American socialists, elected [[Victor Berger]] as a socialist Congressman and [[Emil Seidel]] as a socialist mayor of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], most of the other elected city officials being socialist as well. This Socialist Party of America grew to 150,000 in 1912 and polled 897,000 votes in the presidential campaign of that year, 6 percent of the total vote. Socialist mayor [[Daniel Hoan]], was elected in 1916 and stayed in office until 1940. The final Socialist mayor, [[Frank P. Zeidler]], was elected in 1948 and served three terms, ending in 1960. [[Milwaukee]] remained the hub of Socialism during these years.  The Socialist Party declined after the First World War. By the 1880s [[anarcho-communism]] was already present in the United States as can be seen in the publication of the journal ''Freedom: A Revolutionary Anarchist-Communist Monthly'' by [[Lucy Parsons]] and Lizzy Holmes.&lt;ref name="lucyparsons.org"&gt;[http://lucyparsons.org/biography-iww.php "Lucy Parsons: Woman Of Will" at the [[Lucy Parsons Center]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time these American anarcho-communist sectors entered in debate with the [[individualist anarchist]] group around [[Benjamin Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;"Tucker and other individualist anarchists argued in the pages of ''Liberty'' that anarchist communism was a misnomer because communism implied state authority and true anarchists were against all forms of authority, even the authority of small groups. To individualist anarchists, communistic anarchism, with its ideals of “to each according to need, from each according to ability,” necessarily implied authority over others, because it did not privilege individual liberty as the highest virtue. But for anarchist communist, who saw economic freedom as central, individual liberty without food and shelter seemed impossible. Unlike the individualist tradition, whose ideas had had years of exposure through the English language anarchist press in America with the publication of ''[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]'' from 1872 to 1893 and [[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]] from 1881 to 1908, communistic anarchism had not been advocated in any detail."[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jessica-moran-the-firebrand-and-the-forging-of-a-new-anarchism-anarchist-communism-and-free-lov#toc2 "The Firebrand and the Forging of a New Anarchism: Anarchist Communism and Free Love" by Jessica Moran]&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
French socialism was beheaded by the suppression of the [[Paris commune]] (1871), its leaders killed or exiled. But in 1879, at the [[Socialist Workers' Congress (1879)|Marseille Congress]], workers' associations created the [[Federation of the Socialist Workers of France]]. Three years later, [[Jules Guesde]] and [[Paul Lafargue]], the son-in-law of Karl Marx, left the federation and founded the [[French Workers' Party]].

The Federation of the Socialist Workers of France was termed "possibilist" because it advocated gradual reforms, whereas the French Workers' Party promoted Marxism. In 1905 these two trends merged to form the French [[Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière]] (SFIO), led by [[Jean Jaurès]] and later [[Léon Blum]]. In 1906 it won 56 seats in Parliament. The SFIO adhered to Marxist ideas but became, in practice, a reformist party. By 1914 it had more than 100 members in the Chamber of Deputies.

===World War I===
{{further information|Internationalist/Defencist Schism}}
When World War I began in 1914, many European socialist leaders supported their respective governments' war aims. The social democratic parties in the UK, France, Belgium and Germany supported their respective state's wartime military and economic planning, discarding their commitment to [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] and solidarity.

Lenin, in his [[April Theses]], denounced the war as an [[imperialist]] conflict, and urged workers worldwide to use it as an occasion for [[proletarian]] revolution. The Second International dissolved during the war, while Lenin, Trotsky, [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], together with a small number of other Marxists opposed to the war, came together in the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] in September 1915.

==Anarchism==
{{main article|History of anarchism}}
Anarchism as a [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the 19th century and the [[Spanish Civil War]]-era struggles against [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, "Introduction: Why Anarchism Still Matters", in Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen (eds), ''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age'' (Manchester: [[Manchester University Press]], 2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864 the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blin | first = Arnaud | title = The History of Terrorism | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2007 | isbn  = 0-520-24709-4 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], [[Philadelphes]], English trade unionists, [[socialists]] and [[social democrats]]. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dodson | first = Edward | title = The Discovery of First Principles: Volume 2 | publisher = Authorhouse | page=312 | year = 2002 | isbn  = 0-595-24912-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |ref=harv | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn  = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labor".&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). The [[Federación Obrera Regional Española|Federación Obrera Regional Española (Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region)]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beevor |first=Antony |authorlink=Antony Beevor |year=2006 |title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-84832-5|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America.

Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |title="Action as Propaganda" by Johann Most, July 25, 1885 |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=2003-04-21 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement.  For example, U.S. [[William McKinley|President McKinley]]'s assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] Emma Goldman.

Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn  = 0-520-07297-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]] which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn  = 1-904859-48-8 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a Western-backed grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state.

In Spain, the CNT initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beevor|first=Antony|authorlink=Antony Beevor|year=2006|page=46|title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-84832-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bolloten | first = Burnett | authorlink = Burnett Bolloten | coauthors = | title = The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | date = 1984-11-15 | location = | page =1107 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn  = 978-0-8078-1906-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|dissident Marxists]] and anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=1-57181-542-2 |page=29 |title=Sartre Against Stalinism |first=Ian |last=Birchall |year=2004 |publisher=Berghahn Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|1985|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 in [[Carrara]], Italy the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] was founded during an international Anarchist conference in Carrara in 1968 by the three existing European federations of [[Anarchist Federation (France)|France]], the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana|Italian]] and the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] as well as the [[Bulgaria]]n federation in French exile.&lt;ref name="iisg.nl"&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/l/10760196.php London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968] International Institute of Social History, Accessed 19 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Short history of the IAF-IFA"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980206152015/http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/ifa-hist-short.html Short history of the IAF-IFA] A-infos news project, Accessed 19 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement, as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McLaughlin | first = Paul | title = Anarchism and Authority | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2007 | isbn  = 0-7546-6196-2 | page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and [[Squatting|squatter]] movements like that of Barcelona, Spain.

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged.

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.&lt;ref name=rupert&gt;{{cite book | page=66 |last = Rupert | first = Mark | title = Globalization and International Political Economy | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 2006 | isbn  = 0-7425-2943-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police, and the confrontations were selectively portrayed in mainstream media coverage as violent riots. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as ''[[black bloc]]s''; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A landmark struggle of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt;

International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]].

==Social democracy to 1917==
The Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels emphasised the Communist Manifesto's emphasis on winning, as a first step, the "battle of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Engels, ''Communist Manifesto'', Selected Works, p52&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1866 introduction of universal male franchise the SPD had proved that old methods of, "surprise attacks, of revolutions carried through by small conscious minorities at the head of masses lacking consciousness is past". Marxists, Engels emphasised, must "win over the great mass of the people" before initiating a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Frederick, 1895 Introduction to Marx’ Class Struggles in France 1848&amp;ndash;1850&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx believed that it was possible to have a peaceful socialist revolution in England, America and the Netherlands, but not in France, where he believed there had been "perfected ... an enormous bureaucratic and military organisation, with its ingenious state machinery" which must be forcibly overthrown. However, eight years after Marx's death, Engels regarded it possible to achieve a peaceful socialist revolution in France, too.&lt;ref name="Fischer, Ernst p135"/&gt;

In 1896, Eduard Bernstein argued that once full democracy had been achieved, a transition to socialism by gradual means was both possible and more desirable than revolutionary change. Bernstein and his supporters came to be identified as "[[Marxist revisionism|revisionists]]", because they sought to revise the [[classical Marxism|classic tenets of Marxism]]. Although the orthodox Marxists in the party, led by Karl Kautsky, retained the Marxist theory of revolution as the official doctrine of the party, and it was repeatedly endorsed by SPD conferences, in practice the SPD leadership became more and more reformist.

In Europe most Social Democratic parties participated in parliamentary politics and the day-to-day struggles of the trade unions. In the UK, however, many trade unionists who were members of the [[Social Democratic Federation]], which included at various times future trade union leaders such as [[Will Thorne]], [[John Burns]] and [[Tom Mann]], felt that the Federation neglected the industrial struggle. Along with Engels, who refused to support the SDF, many felt that dogmatic approach of the SDF, particularly of its leader, [[Henry Hyndman]], meant that it remained an isolated sect. The mass parties of the working class under social democratic leadership became more reformist and lost sight of their revolutionary objective. Thus the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), founded in 1905, under Jean Jaurès and later Léon Blum adhered to Marxist ideas, but became in practice a reformist party.

In some countries, particularly Britain and the British [[dominion]]s, labour parties were formed. These were parties largely formed by and controlled by the trade unions, rather than formed by groups of socialist activists who then appealed to the workers for support. In Britain, the Labour Party, (at first the [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Representation Committee]]) was established by representatives of trade unions together with affiliated socialist parties, principally the [[Independent Labour Party]] but also for a time the avowedly Marxist Social Democratic Federation and other groups, such as the [[Fabians]]. On 1 December 1899 [[Anderson Dawson]] of the [[Australian Labor Party]] became the Premier of Queensland, Australia, forming the world's first parliamentary socialist government . The Dawson government, however, lasted only one week, being defeated at the first sitting of parliament.

The British Labour Party first won seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1902. It won the majority of the working class away from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] after World War I. In Australia, the Labor Party achieved rapid success, forming its first national government in 1904. Labour parties were also formed in South Africa and New Zealand but had less success. The British Labour Party adopted a specifically socialist constitution (‘Clause four, Part four’) in 1918.

The strongest opposition to revisionism came from socialists in countries such as the [[Russian Empire]] where [[parliamentary democracy]] did not exist. Chief among these was the Russian Vladimir Lenin, whose works such as ''Our Programme'' (1899) set out the views of those who rejected revisionist ideas. In 1903, there was the beginnings of what eventually became a formal split in the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]] into revolutionary Bolshevik and reformist Menshevik factions.

In 1914, the outbreak of World War I led to a crisis in European socialism. The parliamentary leaderships of the socialist parties of Germany, France, Belgium and Britain each voted to support the war aims of their country's governments, although some leaders, like [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in Britain and Karl Liebknecht in Germany, opposed the war from the start. Lenin, in exile in Switzerland, called for revolutions in all the combatant states as the only way to end the war and achieve socialism. Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, together with a small number of other Marxists opposed to the war, came together in the Zimmerwald Conference in September 1915. This conference saw the beginning of the end of the uneasy coexistence of [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]] with the social democrats, and by 1917 [[war-weariness]] led to splits in several socialist parties, notably the German Social Democrats.

The Russian Revolution of October 1917 led to a withdrawal from World War I, one of the principal demands of the Russian revolution, as the Soviet government immediately sued for peace. Germany and the former allies invaded the new Soviet Russia, which had repudiated the former [[Romanov]] regime's national debts and nationalized the banks and major industry. Russia was the only country in the world where socialists had taken power, and it appeared to many socialists to confirm the ideas, strategy and tactics of Lenin and Trotsky.

==The inter-war era and World War II==
The [[October revolution|Russian Revolution]] of October 1917 brought about the definitive ideological division between Communists as denoted with a capital "C" on the one hand and other communist and socialist trends such as anarcho-communists and social democrats, on the other. The [[Left Opposition]] in the Soviet Union gave rise to [[Trotskyism]]  which was to remain isolated and insignificant for another fifty years, except in Sri Lanka where Trotskyism gained the majority and the pro-Moscow wing was expelled from the Communist Party.

In 1922, the fourth congress of the [[Communist International]] took up the policy of the [[United Front]], urging Communists to work with rank and file Social Democrats while remaining critical of their leaders, who they criticised for "betraying" the working class by supporting the war efforts of their respective capitalist classes. For their part, the social democrats pointed to the dislocation caused by revolution and later the growing authoritarianism of the Communist Parties. When the Communist Party of Great Britain applied to affiliate to the Labour Party in 1920 it was turned down.

===Revolutionary socialism and the Soviet Union (1917–1939)===
After three years, the First World War, at first greeted with enthusiastic patriotism, produced an upsurge of radicalism in most of Europe and also as far afield as the United States  (''see [[Socialism in the United States]]'') and Australia. In the Russian revolution of February 1917, workers' councils (in [[Russian language|Russian]], ''soviets'') had been formed, and Lenin and the Bolsheviks called for "All power to the Soviets". After the October 1917 Russian revolution, led by Lenin and Trotsky, consolidated power in the Soviets, Lenin declared "Long live the world socialist revolution!".&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, ''Meeting of the Petrograd Soviet of workers and soldiers' deputies October 25, 1917'', Collected works, Vol 26, p239. Lawrence and Wishart, (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly in Soviet Russia socialism was not just a vision of a future society, but a description of an existing one. The Soviet regime began to bring all the means of production (except agricultural production) under state control, and implemented a system of government through the workers' councils or soviets.

The initial success of the Russian Revolution inspired other revolutionary parties to attempt the same thing unleashing the [[Revolutions of 1917-23]]. In the chaotic circumstances of postwar Europe, with the socialist parties divided and discredited, Communist revolutions across Europe seemed a possibility. Communist parties were formed, often from minority or majority factions in most of the world's socialist parties, which broke away in support of the [[Leninist]] model.

The [[German Revolution]] of 1918 overthrew the old absolutism and, like Russia, set up Workers' and Soldiers' Councils almost entirely made up of SPD and Independent Social Democrats (USPD) members. The [[Weimar republic]] was established and placed the SPD in power, under the leadership of [[Friedrich Ebert]]. Ebert agreed with [[Prince Maximilian of Baden|Max von Baden]] that a social revolution was to be prevented and the state order must be upheld at any cost. In 1919 the [[Spartacist uprising]] challenged the power of the SPD government, but it was put down in blood and the German Communist leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were assassinated. Communist regimes briefly held power under [[Béla Kun]] in Hungary and under [[Kurt Eisner]] in [[Bavaria]]. There were further revolutionary movements in Germany until 1923, as well as in [[Vienna]], and also in the industrial centres of northern Italy.

In this period few Communists doubted, least of all Lenin and Trotsky, that successful socialist revolutions carried out by the working classes of the most developed capitalist counties were essential to the success of the socialism, and therefore to the success of socialism in Russia in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Bertil, Hessel, Introduction, ''Theses, Resolutions and Manifestos of the first four congresses of the Third International'', pxiii, Ink Links (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1918, Lenin said: "We are doomed if the German revolution does not break out".&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, ''Speech To The Seventh Congress Of The Russian Communist Party On The Brest-Litovsk Peace'' 7 March 1918, Works, third edition, vol 22, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the Communist Parties came together to form a 'Third International', termed the [[Communist International]] or [[Comintern]]. But the prolonged revolutionary period in Germany did not bring a socialist revolution.

A marxist current critical of the bolcheviks emerged and as such "Luxemburg's workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period – [[Anton Pannekoek|Pannekoek]], Roland Holst, and [[Herman Gorter|Gorter]] in the Netherlands, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in Britain, [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]] in Italy, [[György Lukács|Lukacs]] in Hungary. In these formulations, the dictatorship of the proletariat was to be the dictatorship of a class, "not of a party or of a clique".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"&gt;"The [http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol7/ojeili_intellectuals.htm 'Advance Without Authority'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208114529/http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol7/ojeili_intellectuals.htm |date=2012-02-08 }}: Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism and Intellectuals" by Chamsy Ojeili, ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'' vol.7, no.3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; However, within this line of thought "[t]he tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity...The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and [[György Lukács|Lukacs]]...The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form."&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt; In the emerging Soviet state there appeared [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] which were a series of [[rebellion]]s and uprisings against the [[Bolshevik]]s led or supported by left wing groups including [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]],&lt;ref name="carr1985"&gt;Carr, E.H.&amp;nbsp;– The Bolshevik Revolution 1917–1923. W. W. Norton &amp; Company 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], [[Mensheviks]], and [[Anarchism in Russia|anarchists]].&lt;ref name="avrich1968"&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]]. "Russian Anarchists and the Civil War", ''Russian Review'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Jul., 1968), pp. 296–306. [[Blackwell Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some were in support of the [[White Movement]] while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the [[Russian Civil War]] and after until 1922. In response the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force.

Within a few years a bureaucracy developed in Russia as a result of the Russian Civil War, foreign invasion, and Russia's historic poverty and backwardness. The bureaucracy undermined the democratic and socialist ideals of the Bolshevik Party and elevated Stalin to their leadership after Lenin's death. In order to consolidate power, the bureaucracy conducted a brutal campaign of lies and violence against the Left Opposition led by Trotsky.

By the mid 1920s, the impetus had gone out of the revolutionary forces in Europe and the national reformist socialist parties had regained their dominance over the working-class movement in most countries. The German Social Democrats held office for much of the 1920s, the British Labour Party formed its first government in 1924, and the French Socialists were also influential. In the Soviet Union, from 1924 [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] pursued a policy of "[[socialism in one country]]". Trotsky argued that this approach was a shift away from the theory of Marx and Lenin, while others argued that it was a practical compromise fit for the times.

The postwar revolutionary upsurge provoked a powerful reaction from the forces of conservatism. [[Winston Churchill]] declared that Bolshevism must be "strangled in its cradle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282 Cover Story: Churchill's Greatness.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004110408/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282 |date=4 October 2006}} Interview with Jeffrey Wallin. (The Churchill Centre)&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of Russia by the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allies]], their trade embargo and backing for the White forces fighting against the Red Army in the civil war in the Soviet Union was cited by Aneurin Bevan, the leader of the left-wing in the Labour Party, as one of the causes of the Russian revolution's degeneration into dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Bevan also cites the economic backwardness of the region. Aneurin Bevan, ''In Place of Fear'', p62-3. MacGibbon and Kee, (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[Red scare]]" in the United States was raised against the [[Socialist Party of America|American Socialist Party]] of Eugene V. Debs and the [[Communist Party of America]] which arose after the Russian revolution from members who had broken from Debs' party. In Europe, fascist movements received significant funding, particularly from industrialists in heavy industry,&lt;ref&gt;De Grand, Alexander, ''Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany'', p20, Routledge, (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerin, Daniel, ''Fascism and big business'', p22 ff&lt;/ref&gt; and came to power in Italy in 1922 under [[Benito Mussolini]], and later in Germany in 1933, in Spain (1937) and Portugal, while strong fascist movements also developed in [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]].

After 1929, with the Left Opposition legally banned and Trotsky exiled, Stalin led the Soviet Union into a what he termed a "higher stage of socialism." Agriculture was forcibly [[Collectivization|collectivised]], at the cost of a [[holodomor|massive famine]] and millions of deaths among the resistant peasantry. The surplus squeezed from the peasants was spent on a program of crash industrialisation, guided by the Communist Party through the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]]. This program produced some impressive results,&lt;ref&gt;According to Trotsky there was a 250% growth in industrial production between 1929 and 1935, compared to an increase of 40% in Japan and a decline of approximately 25% in the USA (the years of the Great Depression). Heavy industry increasing by 1000% in the ten years to 1935. cf Trotsky, ''Revolution Betrayed'', p15. Pathfinder, (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; though at enormous human costs. Russia raised itself from an economically backward country to that of a superpower. Later Soviet development, however, particularly after the [[World War II|Second World War]], was no faster than it was in Japan or the United States under capitalism. The use of resources, material and human, in the Soviet Union became very wasteful. Stalin's industrialization policy was geared towards the development of heavy industry, an emphasis that facilitated Soviet military action in its defence against Hitler's invasion during the Second World War in which the USSR stood on the side of the [[Allies of World War II]]. For "many Marxian [[libertarian socialists]], the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The [[Bordigists]] and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return “behind Marx” to the [[anti-positivist]] programme of [[German idealism]]. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy... [[Karl Korsch]]... remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of  practice in a theory’s truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx’s Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes. "&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt;

The Soviet achievement in the 1930s seemed hugely impressive from the outside, and convinced many people, not necessarily Communists or even socialists, of the virtues of state planning and authoritarian models of social development. This was later to have important consequences in countries like China, India and [[Egypt]], which tried to copy some aspects of the Soviet model. It also won large sections of the western [[intelligentsia]] over to a pro-Soviet view, to the extent that many were willing to ignore or excuse such events as Stalin's [[Great Purge]] of 1936-38, in which millions of people died.

The [[Great Depression]], which began in 1929, seemed to socialists and Communists everywhere to be the final proof of the bankruptcy, literally as well as politically, of capitalism. But socialists were unable to take advantage of the Depression to either win elections or stage revolutions. Labor governments in Britain and Australia were disastrous failures. In the United States, the liberalism of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won mass support and deprived socialists of any chance of gaining ground. And in Germany it was the fascists of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party]] who successfully exploited the Depression to win power, in January 1933.

Hitler's regime swiftly destroyed both the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, the worst blow the world socialist movement had ever suffered. This forced Stalin to reassess his strategy, and from 1935 the Comintern began urging a [[Popular Front]] against fascism. The socialist parties were at first suspicious, given the bitter hostility of the 1920s, but eventually effective Popular Fronts were formed in both France and Spain. After the election of a Popular Front government in Spain in 1936 a fascist military revolt led to the Spanish Civil War. The crisis in Spain also brought down the Popular Front government in France under Léon Blum. Ultimately the Popular Fronts were not able to prevent the spread of fascism or the aggressive plans of the fascist powers. [[Trotskyists]] considered Popular Fronts a "strike breaking conspiracy"&lt;ref name="marxists.catbull.com"&gt;[http://marxists.catbull.com/archive/trotsky/1936/whitherfrance/ch03a.htm Trotsky, Leon, ''France at a Turning Point'', (1936) in ''Wither France'', p105. New Park, 1974]&lt;/ref&gt; and considered them an impediment to successful resistance to fascism.

When Stalin consolidated his power in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s, Trotsky was forced into exile, eventually residing in Mexico. He maintained active in organizing the Left Opposition internationally, which worked within the Comintern to gain new members. Some leaders of the Communist Parties sided with Trotsky, such as [[James P. Cannon]] in the United States. They found themselves expelled by the Stalinist Parties and persecuted by both GPU agents and the political police in Britain, France, the United States, China, and all over the world. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Trotskyist parties had a large influence in Sri Lanka and Bolivia. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1938, Trotsky and his supporters founded a new international organisation of dissident communists, the [[Fourth International]]. In his ''Results and Prospects'' and ''[[Permanent revolution|Permanent Revolution]]'' Trotsky developed a theory of revolution uninterrupted by the stagism of [[Stalinist]] orthodoxy. He argued that Russia was a bureaucratically [[degenerated workers state]] in his work ''The Revolution Betrayed'', where he predicted (?) that if a political revolution of the working class did not overthrow Stalinism, the Stalinist bureaucracy would resurrect capitalism. Trotsky's ''History of the Russian Revolution'' is considered a work of primary importance by Trotsky's followers. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Britain===
Once the world's most powerful nation, Britain avoided a revolution during the period of 1917&amp;ndash;1923 but was significantly affected by revolt. The Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], had promised the troops in the 1918 election that his Conservative-led coalition would make post-war Britain "a fit land for heroes to live in". But many demobbed troops complained of chronic unemployment and suffered low pay, disease and poor housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftermathww1.com/landfit.asp ''A Land Fit For Heroes?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, the Labour Party adopted as its aim to secure for the workers, "the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange". In 1919, the Miners Federation, whose Members of Parliament pre-dated the formation of the Labour Party and were since 1906 a part of that body, demanded the withdrawal of British troops from Soviet Russia. The 1919 Labour Party conference voted to discuss the question of affiliation to the Third (Communist) International, "to the distress of its leaders".&lt;ref&gt;Cole and Postgate, ''The Common People'', p551&lt;/ref&gt; A vote was won committing the Labour Party committee of the Trades Union Congress to arrange "direct industrial action" to "stop capitalist attacks upon the Socialist Republics of Russia and Hungary."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/pankhurst-sylvia/1919/british-workers.htm Sylvia Pankhurst, 'The British Workers and Soviet Russia'], published in ''The Revolutionary Age'', August 9, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of immediate strike action forced the Conservative-led coalition government to abandon its intervention in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Pankhurst reported that, "The London district committee of the dockers has decided to declare a strike on July 20 and 21, but it goes further, it had decided to advise its members to abstain from working on any ships bound for Russia or assisting in any way the overthrow of the Russian proletariat". [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pankhurst-sylvia/1919/british-workers.htm Sylvia Pankhurst, 'The British Workers and Soviet Russia'], published in ''The Revolutionary Age'', August 9, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 the unions of the transport workers, the mine workers and the railway workers had formed a [[Triple Alliance (1914)|Triple Alliance]]. In 1919, Lloyd George sent for the leaders of the Triple Alliance, one of whom was miner's leader [[Robert Smillie]], a founder member of the Independent Labour Party in 1889 who was to become a Labour Party MP in the first [[First Labour Government (UK)|1924 Labour government]]. According to Smillie, Lloyd George said: {{quote|Gentlemen, you have fashioned, in the Triple Alliance of the unions represented by you, a most powerful instrument. I feel bound to tell you that in our opinion we are at your mercy. The Army is disaffected and cannot be relied upon. Trouble has occurred already in a number of camps. We have just emerged from a great war and the people are eager for the reward of their sacrifices, and we are in no position to satisfy them. In these circumstances, if you carry out your threat and strike, then you will defeat us.

But if you do so, have you weighed the consequences? The strike will be in defiance of the government of the country and by its very success will precipitate a constitutional crisis of the first importance. For, if a force arises in the state which is stronger than the state itself, then it must be ready to take on the functions of the state, or withdraw and accept the authority of the state. Gentlemen, have you considered, and if you have, are you ready?|author=Aneurin Bevan, ''In Place of Fear''&lt;ref&gt;Bevan, Aneurin, ''In Place of Fear'' p40. MacGibbon and Kee, (1961). Bevan reports verbatim what Robert Smillie told him of his meeting with Lloyd George.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"From that moment on", Smillie conceded to Aneurin Bevan, "we were beaten and we knew we were". When the [[UK General Strike of 1926]] broke out, the trade union leaders, "had never worked out the revolutionary implications of direct action on such a scale", Bevan says.&lt;ref&gt;Bevan, Aneurin, ''In Place of Fear'' p40. MacGibbon and Kee, (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Bevan was a member of the Independent Labour Party and one of the leaders of the South Wales miners during the strike. The TUC called off the strike after nine days. In the North East of England and elsewhere, "councils of action" were set up, with many rank and file Communist Party members often playing a critical role. The councils of action took control of essential transport and other duties.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, cf Mason, Anthony, ''The General strike in the North-East'', University of Hull Publications (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; When the strike ended, the miners were locked out and remained locked out for six months. Bevan became a Labour MP in 1929.

In January 1924, the Labour Party formed a minority government for the first time with Ramsay MacDonald as prime minister. The Labour Party intended to ratify an Anglo-Russian trade agreement, which would break the trade embargo on Russia. This was attacked by the Conservatives and new elections took place in October 1924. Four days before polling day the ''Daily Mail'' published the [[Zinoviev letter]], a forgery that claimed the Labour Party had links with Soviet Communists and was secretly fomenting revolution. The fears instilled by the press of a Labour Party in secret Communist manoeuvres, together with the half-hearted "respectable" policies pursued by MacDonald, led to Labour losing the October 1924 general election. The victorious Conservatives repudiated the Anglo-Soviet treaty.

The leadership of the Labour Party, like social democratic parties almost everywhere, (with the exception of Sweden and Belgium), tried to pursue a policy of moderation and economic orthodoxy. At times of depression this policy was not popular with the Labour Party's working class supporters. The influence of Marxism grew in the Labour Party during the inter-war years. Anthony Crosland argued in 1956 that under the impact of the 1931 slump and the growth of fascism, the younger generation of left-wing intellectuals for the most part "took to Marxism" including the "best-known leaders" of the Fabian tradition, [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]. The Marxist Professor [[Harold Laski]], who was to be chairman of the Labour Party in 1945-6, was the "outstanding influence" in the political field.&lt;ref&gt;Crosland, Anthony, ''The Future of Socialism'', p4 and note 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marxists within the Labour Party differed in their attitude to the Communists. Some were uncitical and some were expelled as "fellow travellers", while in the 1930s others were Trotskyists and sympathisers working inside the Labour Party, especially in its youth wing where they were influential.

In the general election of 1929 the Labour Party won 288 seats out of 615 and formed another minority government. The depression of that period brought high unemployment and Prime Minister MacDonald sought to make cuts in order to balance the budget. The trade unions opposed MacDonald's proposed cuts and he split the Labour government to form the [[UK National Government|National Government]] of 1931. This experience moved the Labour Party leftward, and at the start of the Second World War an official Labour Party pamphlet written by Harold Laski argued that, "the rise of Hitler and the methods by which he seeks to maintain and expand his power are deeply rooted in the economic and social system of Europe... economic nationalism, the fight for markets, the destruction of political democracy, the use of war as an instrument of national policy": {{quote|The war will leave its meed&lt;ref&gt;Meed&amp;nbsp;– literally, 'Reward', here used sardonically&lt;/ref&gt; of great problems, problems of internal social organisation... Business men and aristocrats, the old ruling classes of Europe, had their chance from 1919 to 1939; they failed to take advantage of it. They rebuilt the world in the image of their own vested interests... The ruling class has failed; this war is the proof of it. The time has come to give the common people the right to become the master of their own destiny... Capitalism has been tried; the results of its power are before us today. Imperialism has been tried; it is the foster-parent of this great agony.

Given power [the Labour Party] will seek, as no other Party will seek, the basic transformation of our society. It will replace the profit-seeking motive by the motive of public service... there is now no prospect of domestic well-being or of international peace except in Socialism.|author=Harold Laski, ''The Labour Party, the War and the Future'' (1939)&lt;ref&gt;Published by the Labour Party in November 1939&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===United States===
After embracing anarchism, [[Albert Parsons]] turned his activity to the growing movement to establish the [[Eight hour day|8-hour day]]. In January 1880, the Eight-Hour League of Chicago sent Parsons to a national conference in [[Washington, D.C.]], a gathering which launched a national lobbying movement aimed at coordinating efforts of labor organizations to win and enforce the 8-hour workday.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Life of Albert R. Parsons,'' pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1884, Parsons launched a weekly [[anarchism|anarchist]] newspaper in Chicago, ''[[The Alarm (newspaper)|The Alarm]].''&lt;ref&gt;''The Alarm'' is available on microfilm in two different filmings, with one master negative held by the [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]] and the other by the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]].&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue was dated October 4, 1884, and was produced in a press run of 15,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Alarm,'' October 11, 1884, page 1, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was a 4-page [[broadsheet]] with a cover price of 5 cents. ''The Alarm'' listed the International Working People's Association as its publisher and touted itself as "A Socialistic Weekly" on its page 2 [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Masthead, ''The Alarm,'' vol. 1, no. 5 (November 1, 1884), pg. 2, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 1886, Parsons, with his wife [[Lucy Parsons]] and two children, led 80,000 people down Michigan Avenue, in what is regarded as the first-ever [[May Day]] Parade, in support of the eight-hour work day.  Over the next few days 340,000 laborers joined the strike. Parsons, amidst the May Day Strike, found himself called to Cincinnati, where 300,000 workers had struck that Saturday afternoon. On that Sunday he addressed the rally in Cincinnati of the news from the "storm center" of the strike and participated in a second huge parade, led by 200 members of The Cincinnati Rifle Union, with certainty that victory was at hand. In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt; In response, unions across the [[United States]] prepared a [[general strike]] in support of the event.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt; On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when [[strikebreaker]]s attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |first=Paul |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |year=1984 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-00600-8 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day on 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=193 |isbn=0-691-04711-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J.

The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made.

In the Presidential election of 1912, [[Eugene V. Debs]] received 5.99% of the popular vote (a total of 901,551 votes), while his total of 913,693 votes in the 1920 campaign, although smaller percentage-wise, remains the all-time high for a Socialist Party candidate in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=1912: Wilson, Roosevelt, Taft and Debs – The Election that Changed the Country  |last=Chace |first=James |authorlink=James Chace |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location= |isbn=0-7432-7355-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Communist Party USA]] was formed in 1919 from former adherents of the Socialist Party of America. One of the founders, James Cannon, later became the leader of [[Trotskyist]] forces outside the Soviet Union.  The Great Depression began in the US on [[Black Tuesday]], October 29, 1929. Unemployment rates passed 25%, prices and incomes fell 20–50%, but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. 9,000 banks failed during the decade of the 30s. By 1933, depositors saw $140 billion of their deposits disappear due to uninsured bank failures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/money_08.html Bank Failures during the 1930s Great Depression&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 occurred the largest armed, organized uprising in American labor history: the [[Battle of Blair Mountain]]. Ten to fifteen thousand coal miners rebelled in [[West Virginia]], assaulting mountain-top lines of trenches established by the coal companies and local sheriff's forces.

Workers organized against their deteriorating conditions and socialists played a critical role. In 1934 the [[Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934|Minneapolis Teamsters Strike]] led by the Trotskyist [[Communist League of America]], the [[1934 West Coast Longshore Strike|West Coast Longshore Strike]] led by the Communist Party USA, and the Toledo [[Auto-Lite Strike]] led by the [[American Workers Party]], played an important role in the formation of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) in the USA.

In [[Minnesota]], the General Drivers Local 574 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters struck, despite an attempt to block the vote by AFL officials, demanding union recognition, increased wages, shorter hours, overtime rates, improved working conditions and job protection through seniority. In the battles that followed, which captured country-wide media attention, three strikes took place, martial law was declared and the National Guard was sent in. Two strikers were killed. Protest rallies of 40,000 were held. Farrell Dobbs, who became the leader of the local, had at the outset joined the "small and poverty-stricken" Communist League of America, founded by James P. Cannon and others in 1928 after their expulsion from the Communist Party USA for Trotskyism.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs, Farrell, ''Teamster Rebellion'', Monad Press, New York, (1972), p21ff, p34, p92&lt;/ref&gt;

Success for the CIO quickly followed its formation. In 1937, one of the founding unions of the CIO, the [[United Auto Workers]], won union recognition at [[General Motors Corporation]] after a tumultuous forty-four-day sit-down strike, while the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]], which was formed by the CIO, won a collective bargaining agreement with [[U.S. Steel]]. The CIO merged with the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) in 1955 becoming the [[AFL-CIO]].

===Germany===
In 1928, the Communist International, now fully under the leadership of Stalin, turned from the united front policy to an ultra-left policy of the [[Third Period]], a policy of aggressive confrontation of social democracy. This divided the working class at a critical time.

Like the Labour Party in the UK, the Social Democratic Party in Germany, which was in power in 1928, followed an orthodox deflationary policy and pressed for reductions in unemployment benefits in order to save taxes and reduce budget deficits. These policies did not halt the recession and the government resigned.

The Communists described the Social Democratic leaders as "social fascists" and in the [[Prussian Landtag]] they voted with the Nazis to bring down the Social Democratic government. Fascism continued to grow, with powerful backing from industrialists, especially in heavy industry, and Hitler was invited into power in 1933.

Hitler's regime swiftly destroyed both the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, the worst blow the world socialist movement had ever suffered. This forced Stalin to reassess his strategy, and from 1935 the Comintern began urging the formation of Popular Fronts, which were to include not just the Social Democratic parties but critically also "progressive capitalist" parties which were wedded to a capitalist policy.

After the election of a Popular Front government in Spain in 1936 a fascist military revolt led to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The crisis in Spain brought down the Popular Front government in France under Léon Blum. Ultimately the Popular Fronts were not able to prevent the spread of fascism or the aggressive plans of the fascist powers. Trotskyists considered Popular Fronts a "strike breaking conspiracy", an impediment to successful resistance to fascism due to their inclusion of pro-capitalist parties which demanded policies of opposition to strikes and workers’ actions against the capitalist class.&lt;ref name="marxists.catbull.com"/&gt;

===Sweden===
The Swedish Socialists formed a government in 1932. They broke with economic orthodoxy during the depression and carried out extensive public works financed from government borrowing. They emphasised large-scale intervention and the high unemployment they had inherited was eliminated by 1938. Their success encouraged the adoption of Keynesian policies of deficit financing pursued by almost all Western countries after World War II.

===Spain===
During the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[anarchist]]s set up different forms of cooperative and communal arrangements, especially in the rural areas of Aragon and Catalonia. However, these communes were disbanded by the Popular Front government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21553616?versionId=25838615| title=With the peasants of Aragon| publisher=National Library of Australia| accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Post-war era (1945–1985)==
In the 1930s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), a [[Reformism|reformist socialist]] political party that was up to then based upon [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]] [[Marxism]], began a transition away from Marxism towards liberal socialism beginning in the 1930s. After the party was banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the [[Sopade]]. In 1934 the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Joachim Edinger. ''German Exile Politics: The Social Democratic Exexctive Committee in the Nazi Era''. University of California Press, 1956. Pp. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Sopade member [[Curt Geyer]] was a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, and declared that Sopade represented the tradition of [[Weimar Republic]] [[social democracy]]—liberal [[democratic socialism]], and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Joachim Edinger. ''German Exile Politics: The Social Democratic Exexctive Committee in the Nazi Era''. University of California Press, 1956. Pp. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt; After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, The SPD's [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist-aligned policies. The SPD then became officially based upon ''freiheitlicher Sozialismus'' (liberal socialism).&lt;ref name="Dietrich Orlow 2000. Pp. 108"&gt;Dietrich Orlow.

In 1945, the world's three great powers met at the Yalta Conference to negotiate an amicable and stable peace. UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined USA President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee. With the relative decline of Britain compared to the two [[superpower]]s, the USA and the Soviet Union, however, many viewed the world as "bi-polar"{{spaced ndash}}a world with two irreconcilable and antagonistic political and economic systems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

As a result of the failure of the Popular Fronts and the inability of Britain and France to conclude a defensive alliance against Hitler, Stalin again changed his policy in August 1939 and signed a non-aggression pact, the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], with [[Nazi Germany]]. Shortly afterwards World War II broke out, and within two years Hitler had occupied most of Europe, and by 1942 both democracy and social democracy in central Europe fell under the threat of fascism. The only socialist parties of any significance able to operate freely were those in Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. But the entry of the Soviet Union into the war in 1941 marked the turning of the tide against fascism, and as the German armies retreated another great upsurge in left-wing sentiment swelled up in their wake. The resistance movements against German occupation were mostly led by socialists and communists, and by the end of the war the parties of the left were greatly strengthened.

One of the great postwar victories of democratic socialism was the election victory of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Clement Attlee]] in June 1945. Socialist (and in some places Stalinist) parties also dominated postwar governments in France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Norway and other European countries. The [[Sveriges socialdemokratiska arbetareparti|Social Democratic Party]] had been in power in Sweden since 1932, and Labour parties also held power in Australia and New Zealand. In Germany, on the other hand, the Social Democrats emerged from the war much weakened, and were defeated in Germany's first democratic elections in 1949. The united front between democrats and the Stalinist parties which had been established in the wartime resistance movements continued in the immediate postwar years. The democratic socialist parties of Eastern Europe, however, were destroyed when Stalin imposed so-called "Communist" regimes in these countries.

The Second International, which had been based in [[Amsterdam]], ceased to operate during the war. It was refounded as the [[Socialist International]] at a congress in [[Frankfurt-am-Main|Frankfurt]] in 1951. Since Stalin had dissolved the Comintern in 1943, as part of a deal with the imperialist powers, this was now the only effective international socialist organisation. The Frankfurt Declaration took a stand against both capitalism and the Communism of Stalin: {{quote|Socialism aims to liberate the peoples from dependence on a minority which owns or controls the means of production. It aims to put economic power in the hands of the people as a whole, and to create a community in which free men work together as equals... Socialism has become a major force in world affairs. It has passed from propaganda into practice. In some countries the foundations of a Socialist society have already been laid. Here the evils of capitalism are disappearing...

Since the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, Communism has split the International Labour Movement and has set back the realisation of socialism in many countries for decades. Communism falsely claims a share in the Socialist tradition. In fact, it has distorted that tradition beyond recognition. It has built up a rigid theology which is incompatible with the critical spirit of Marxism... Wherever it has gained power it has destroyed freedom or the chance of gaining freedom...|author=The Frankfurt Declaration, 1951}} [[Anarcho-pacifism]] became influential in the [[Anti-nuclear movement]] and [[anti war movement]]s of the time&lt;ref&gt;"In the forties and fifties, anarchism, in fact if not in name, began to reappear, often in alliance with pacifism, as the basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War.[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/] The anarchist/pacifist wing of the peace movement was small in comparison with the wing of the movement that emphasized electoral work, but made an important contribution to the movement as a whole. Where the more conventional wing of the peace movement rejected militarism and war under all but the most dire circumstances, the anarchist/pacifist wing rejected these on principle."[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm "Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement" by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In the 1950s and 1960s anarcho-pacifism began to gel, tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence. Its first practical manifestation was at the level of method: nonviolent direct action, principled and pragmatic, was used widely in both the Civil Rights movement in the USA and the campaign against nuclear weapons in Britain and elsewhere."[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Geoffrey_Ostergaard__Resisting_the_Nation_State._The_pacifist_and_anarchist_tradition.html#toc13 Geoffrey Ostergaard.

Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm "Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement" by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt; The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's [[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]], ''Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)''.&lt;!--ref name="robertgraham.wordpress.com"/--&gt;

===The first socialist government in a North American country===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tommy-Douglas.jpg|thumb|[[Tommy Douglas]] [[Premier of Saskatchewan]] 1944&amp;ndash;1961 leader of the federal NDP 1962–1971]] --&gt;
The first socialist government of Canada and one of the most influential came to power in the province of [[Saskatchewan]] in 1944. The [[New Democratic Party of Saskatchewan|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] of [[Tommy Douglas]] won an overwhelming victory toppling the age old Liberal regime which had dominated Saskatchewan politics since the founding of the province in 1905. Douglas and the CCF won five consecutive electoral victories. During his time in office he created the Saskatchewan Power Corp. which extended electricity services to the many rural villages and farms who before did without, created Canada's first public automobile insurance agency, created a substantial number of [[Crown Corporations]] (government and public owned businesses) many of which still exist today in Saskatchewan, allowed the unionization of the public service, created the first system of [[Health care in Canada|Universal Health Care]] in Canada (which would later be adopted nationally in 1965), and created Saskatchewan's Bill of Rights, the first such charter in Canada. This preceded the Canadian [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] as well as the previous [[Canadian Bill of Rights]].

The [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (as the CCF became known in 1962)  went on to dominate the politics of Saskatchewan and form governments in [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]], and the [[Yukon Territory]]. Nationally the NDP would become very influential during four minority governments, and is today by far Canada's most successful left-wing political party.
In 2004 Canadians voted Tommy Douglas in as ''[[The Greatest Canadian]]'' as part of a nationwide contest organized by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC).

===Social democracy in government===
The social democratic governments in the post war period introduced measures of social reform and wealth redistribution through state welfare and taxation policy. For instance the newly elected UK Labour government carried out [[nationalization|nationalisations]] of major utilities such as mines, gas, coal, electricity, rail, iron and steel, and the Bank of England.&lt;ref&gt;British Petroleum, privatised in 1987, was officially nationalised in 1951 according to government archives [http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Nationalisation_of_Anglo-Iranian_Oil_Company%2C_1951] with further government intervention during the 1974–79 Labour Government, cf 'The New Commanding Height: Labour Party Policy on North Sea Oil and Gas, 1964–74' in ''Contemporary British History'', Volume 16, Issue 1 Spring 2002, pages 89–118. Some elements of some of these entities were already in public hands. Later Labour renationalised steel (1967, British Steel) after it was denationalised by the Conservatives, and nationalised car production (1976, British Leyland), {{cite web|url=http://www.uksteel.org.uk/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123091612/http://www.uksteel.org.uk/history.htm |archivedate=2008-01-23 |df= }}. In 1977, major aircraft companies and shipbuilding were nationalised&lt;/ref&gt; France claimed to be the most state controlled capitalist country in the world, carrying through many nationalisations.&lt;ref&gt;The nationalisation of public utilities included the CDF&amp;nbsp;– Charbonnages de France; EDF&amp;nbsp;– Électricité de France; GDF&amp;nbsp;– Gaz de France, airlines (Air France), banks (Banque de France) and many other private companies like the Renault car factory (Régie Nationale des Usines Renault) {{cite web|url=http://www.sund.ac.uk/~os0tmc/contem/trente1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010635/http://www.sund.ac.uk/~os0tmc/contem/trente1.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the National Health Service was established bringing free health care to all for the first time. Social housing for working-class families was provided in council housing estates and university education was made available for working-class people through a grant system.

However, the parliamentary leadership of the social democracies in general had no intention of ending capitalism, and their national outlook and their dedication to the maintenance of the post-war 'order' prevented the social democracies from making any significant changes to the economy. They were termed 'socialist' by all in 1945, but in the UK, for instance, where Social Democracy had a large majority in Parliament, "The government had not the smallest intention of bringing in the 'common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange'" as written in Clause 4 of the Labour Party constitution.&lt;ref name="Beckett, Francis 2007, p243"&gt;Beckett, Francis, ''Clem Attlee'', Politico, 2007, p243&lt;/ref&gt;  In Germany, the Social Democratic Party of Germany adopted the [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959, which rejected [[class struggle]] and Marxism.

In the UK, cabinet minister Herbert Morrison famously argued that, "Socialism is what the Labour government does",&lt;ref name="Beckett, Francis 2007, p243"/&gt; and [[Anthony Crosland]] argued that capitalism had been ended.&lt;ref&gt;"To the question ’Is this still capitalism?’ I would answer ‘No’." Crosland, Anthony, ''The Future of Socialism'' p46. Constable (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However many socialists within the social democracy, at rank and file level as well as in a minority in the leadership such as Aneurin Bevan, feared the 'return of the 1930s' unless capitalism was ended, either directly or over a definite period of time. They criticised the government for not going further to take over the commanding heights of the economy. Bevan demanded that the "main streams of economic activity are brought under public direction" with economic planning, and criticised the Labour Party's implementation of nationalisation for not empowering the workers in the nationalised industries with democratic control over their operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bevan, Aneurin, ''In Place of Fear'' p50, p126-128, MacGibbon and Kee, second edition (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; In the post war period, many Trotskyists expected at first the pattern of financial instability and recession to return. Instead the capitalist world, now led by the United States, embarked on a prolonged boom which lasted until 1973. Rising living standards across Europe and North America alongside low unemployment, was achieved, in the view of the socialists, by the efforts of trade union struggle, social reform by social democracy, and the ushering in of what was termed a "mixed economy".&lt;ref name="Beckett, Francis 2007, p243"/&gt;

Social democracy at first took the view that they had begun a "serious assault" on the five "Giant Evils" afflicting the working class, identified for instance by the British social reformer [[William Beveridge]]: "Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness".&lt;ref&gt;cf Beckett, Francis, ''Clem Attlee'', Politico, 2007, p243. "Idleness" meant unemployment, and hence the starvation of the worker and his/her family. It was not then a pejorative term. Unemployment benefit, as well as national insurance and hence state pensions, were introduced by the 1945 Labour government.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the wartime alliance between the Soviet Union and the west broke down from 1946 onwards, and relations between the Communist parties and the democratic socialist parties broke down in parallel.  Once the Stalinists helped stabilize the capitalist governments in the immediate upheavals of 1945, as per the agreements betweens Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill, the capitalist politicians had no more use for them. The French, Italian and Belgian Communists withdrew or were expelled from post-war coalition governments, and [[Greek civil war|civil war]] broke out in Greece. The imposition of Stalinist regimes in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia not only destroyed the socialist parties in those countries, it also produced a reaction against socialism in general. The Australian and New Zealand Labour governments were defeated in 1949, and the British Labour government in 1951. As the [[Cold War]] deepened, conservative rule in Britain, Germany and Italy became more strongly entrenched. Only in the Scandinavian countries and to some extent in France did the socialist parties retain their positions. But in 1958 [[Charles de Gaulle]] seized power in France and the French socialists (SFIO) found themselves cast into opposition.

In the 1960s and 1970s the new social forces, introduced, the social democrats argued, by their 'mixed economy' and their many reforms of capitalism, began to change the political landscape in the western world. The long postwar boom and the rapid expansion of higher education produced, as well as rising living standards for the industrial working class, a mass university-educated white collar workforce, nevertheless began to break down the old socialist-versus-conservative polarity of European politics. This new white-collar workforce, some claimed, was less interested in traditional socialist policies such as state ownership and more interested expanded personal freedom and liberal social policies. The proportion of women in the paid workforce increased and many supported the struggle for equal pay, which, some argued, changed both the composition and the political outlook of the working class. Some socialist parties reacted more flexibly and successfully to these changes than others, but eventually the leaderships of all social democracies in Europe moved to an explicitly pro-capitalist stance. Symbolically in the UK, the socialist clause, Clause four, was removed from the Labour Party constitution, in 1995. A similar change took place in the German SDP.

However, particularly after the coming to power of British Premier [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979 and US President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1981, and the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, many social democratic party leaders were won to the ideological offensive which argued that capitalism had "won" and that, in the words of [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s essay, capitalism had reached "the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.".&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, ''The End of History?'', 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Some parties reacted to these changes by engaging in a new round of [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] re-assessment of socialist ideology, and adopting a neo-liberal outlook. Some critics argue that in practice the Social Democratic parties, and the Labour Party in particular, can no longer be described as socialist.&lt;ref&gt;AH Hasley writes that Blair's "collaboration with [US President] George W. Bush has shown him to be an American liberal/conservative rather than a British socialist." Hasley, AH, ''Democracy in Crisis: Ethical Socialism for a Prosperous Country'', p77. Politicos (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; On Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s departure in June 2007, left wing trade union leader [[Bob Crow]], general secretary of the [[Rail, Maritime and Transport workers union]] (RMT), argued that Blair will be remembered for "seamlessly continuing the neo-liberal economic and social policies of Margaret Thatcher".&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', June 27, 2007, p10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass discontent and radicalization===
Another manifestation of this changing social landscape was the rise of mass discontent, including the radical student movement, both in the United States&amp;nbsp;– where it was driven mainly by opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], and in Europe. Aside from the Civil Rights Movement, in which socialists participated, the anti-war movement was the first left-wing upsurge in the United States since the 1930s, but neither there nor in Europe did the traditional parties of the left lead the movement. In the mid-20th century some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with [[Trotskyism]] which presented itself as leninist anti-stalinism. As such the French group ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'' emerged from the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]], where Castoriadis and [[Claude Lefort]] constituted a Chaulieu–Montal Tendency in the French [[Internationalist Communist Party|Parti Communiste Internationaliste]] in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their "final disenchantment with Trotskyism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that "the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German "left" of the 1920s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Instead Trotskyist, [[Maoist]] and anarchist groups arose. They became particularly influential in 1968, when riots amounting almost to an insurrection broke out in Paris in [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]]. Between eight and ten million workers struck, challenging the view becoming popular amongst socialists at the time that the working class were no longer a force for change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/24/newsid_2988000/2988263.stm BBC, 1968: De Gaulle: 'Back me or sack me']&lt;/ref&gt; There were also major disturbances such as the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity]] in Chicago, the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]] in New York, the embryonic [[Red Army Faction]] in Berlin, and in other cities. In the short-term these movements provoked a conservative backlash, seen in De Gaulle's 1968 election victory and the election of [[Richard Nixon]] in the United States. But in the 1970s, as particularly the far left Trotskyist groups continued to grow, the socialist and Communist parties again sought to channel people's anger back into safe confines, as they did in 1945.

The British Labour Party had already returned to office under [[Harold Wilson]] in 1964, and in 1969 the German Social Democrats came to power for the first time since the 1920s under [[Willy Brandt]]. In France [[François Mitterrand]] buried the corpse of the old socialist party, the SFIO, and founded a new [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] in 1971, although it would take him a decade to lead it to power. Labour governments were elected in both Australia and New Zealand in 1972, and the Austrian Socialists under [[Bruno Kreisky]] formed their first post-war government in 1970.

The emergence of the New Left in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest in libertarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Hahnel]], ''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation'' Part II {{ISBN|0-415-93344-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left's critique of the [[Old Left]]'s authoritarianism was associated with a strong interest in personal liberty, [[autonomy]] (see the thinking of [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) and led to a rediscovery of older socialist traditions, such as [[left communism]], [[council communism]], and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like ''Radical America'' and ''[[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]]'' in America, ''[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]]'', ''[[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]]'' and ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'', succeeded by ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/ The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy]. Inclusivedemocracy.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, introduced a range of left libertarian ideas to a new generation. [[Social ecology (theory)|Social ecology]], [[autonomism]] and, more recently, [[participatory economics]] (parecon), and [[Inclusive Democracy]] emerged from this.

The New Left in the United States also included anarchist, [[countercultural]] and [[hippie]]-related radical groups such as the [[Yippies]] who were led by [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA112 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]]. By late 1966, [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]] opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name="Lytle_2006_213215"&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2006|pp=213, 215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]]&lt;ref name="Digger Archives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title= Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 | work=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="American Experience doc"&gt;{{cite video| people =[[Gail Dolgin]]; Vicente Franco|date =2007| title =American Experience: The Summer of Love| url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/love/index.html| publisher =PBS| accessdate =23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Yippies employed theatrical gestures, such as advancing a pig ("[[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]] the Immortal") as a candidate for President in 1968, to mock the social status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419101355/pg_2 | work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture | title=Yippies | first=David | last=Holloway | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as a highly theatrical, [[anti-authoritarian]] and anarchist&lt;ref name="Abbie Hoffman page 128"&gt;Abbie Hoffman, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, page 128.

According to [[ABC News]], "The group was known for street theater pranks and was once referred to as the '[[Groucho Marx|Groucho]] [[Marxism|Marxists]]'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/popup?id=3321269&amp;contentIndex=1&amp;page=9&amp;start=false ABC News]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Autonomist Marxism]], [[Neo-Marxism]] and [[Situationist International|Situationist theory]] are also regarded as being [[anti-authoritarian]] variants of Marxism that are firmly within the libertarian socialist tradition. For libcom.org "In the 1980's and 90's, a series of other groups developed, influenced also by much of the above work. The most notable are Kolinko, Kurasje and Wildcat in Germany, ''[[Aufheben]]'' in England, Theorie Communiste in France, TPTG in Greece and Kamunist Kranti in India. They are also connected to other groups in other countries, merging autonomia, operaismo, Hegelian Marxism, the work of the JFT, [[Open Marxism]], the ICO, the Situationist International, anarchism and post-68 German Marxism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/libertarian-marxist-tendency-map "A libertarian Marxist tendency map" by libcom.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this were intellectuals who were influenced by Italian left communist [[Amadeo Bordiga]] but who disagreed with his leninist positions; these included the French publication ''Invariance'' edited by [[Jacques Camatte]], published since 1968, and [[Gilles Dauve]] who published ''Troploin'' with Karl Nesic.

The early 1970s were a particularly stormy period for socialists, as capitalism had its first world wide slump of 1973-4, suffered from rising oil prices, and a crisis in confidence. In southern Europe, for example, the Portuguese [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974 threatened the existence of capitalism for a while due to the insurrection and the occupations which followed. A ''New York Times'' editorial on February 17, 1975, stated "a communist takeover of Portugal might encourage a similar trend in Italy and France, create problems in Greece and Turkey, affect the succession in Spain and Yugoslavia and send tremors throughout Western Europe." The Greek military dictatorship fell in Greece, [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] arose at first with a strong socialist outlook, and in Spain, the Franco dictatorship fell in a period of rising struggle. In Italy there was continual unrest, and governments fell almost annually. The Italian workers won and defended the "scala mobile", the sliding scale of wages linked to inflation. However, as before, neither the Communists nor the social democracy had any plans to abolish capitalism, and the occupations in Portugal, variously estimated to have taken between 70 - 90% of the economy, were gradually rolled back. The UK saw a state of emergency and the three-day week, with 22 million days lost in strike action in 1972, leading to the fall of the Heath government. The Trotskyist [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]], an [[Entryism|entryist]] group active in the Labour Party, became the "fifth most important political party"in the UK for a period in the mid-1980s, according to the journalist [[Michael Crick]].&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Michael, ''The March of Militant'' p2; ''Financial Times'', 12 June 2007, 'Working days lost to strike action soars'; Office for National Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (1945–1985)==
[[File:Brezhnev 1973.jpg|thumb|[[Leonid Brezhnev]]]]
Immediately after the Second World War, a period known as the Cold War began. It represented a period of conflict, tension and competition between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies. Throughout the period, the rivalry between the two superpowers was played out in multiple arenas: military coalitions; ideology, psychology, and espionage; military, industrial, and technological developments, including the space race; costly defense spending; a massive conventional and [[nuclear arms race]]; and many proxy wars.

The term "Cold War" was introduced in 1947 by Americans Bernard Baruch and [[Walter Lippmann]] to describe emerging tensions between the two former wartime allies.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Halliday, "Cold War" The Oxford Companion to the Politics of the World, 2e. Joel Krieger, ed. Oxford University Press Inc. 2001.
&lt;/ref&gt; There never was a direct military engagement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, but there was a half-century of military buildup, and political battles for support around the world, including significant involvement of allied and satellite nations. Although the U.S. and the Soviet Union had been allied against Nazi Germany, the two sides differed on how to reconstruct the postwar world even before the end of World War II. Over the following decades, the Cold War spread outside Europe to every region of the world, as the U.S. sought the "containment" of communism and forged numerous alliances to this end, particularly in Western Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

In 1946, speaking at [[Westminster College (Missouri)|Westminster College]] in [[Fulton, Missouri]], former British [[prime minister]] Winston Churchill warned that, "From [[Stettin]] in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] to [[Trieste]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], an [[iron curtain]] has descended across the Continent."

In the months that followed, Josef Stalin continued to solidify a Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe. For example, Bulgaria received its new Communist premier, [[Georgi Dimitrov]], in November 1946, a Communist government under [[Bolesław Bierut]] had been established in Poland already in 1945, and by 1947, Hungary and Romania had also come under full communist rule.  The last democratic government in the [[eastern bloc]], [[Czechoslovakia]], fell to a Communist coup in 1948, and in 1949 the Soviets raised their occupation zone in Germany to become the [[German Democratic Republic]] under [[Walter Ulbricht]].

To coordinate their new empire, the Soviets established a number of international organizations, first the [[Cominform]] to coordinate the policies of the various Communist parties, then the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON), in 1948, to control economic planning, and finally (in response to the entry of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] into the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]) the [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1955, which served as a military alliance against the west.

But one crack within that sphere of influence emerged after 1948, when Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] became the president of [[Yugoslavia]]. Initial disagreement was over the level of independence claimed by Tito as the only East European Communist ruler commanding a strong domestic majority. Later the gap widened when Tito's government initiated a system of decentralized profit-sharing workers' councils, in effect a self-governing, somewhat market-oriented socialism, which Stalin considered dangerously revisionist.

Stalin died in 1953. In the power struggle that followed Stalin's death, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] emerged triumphant.  In 1956, at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], he denounced the "[[personality cult]]" that had surrounded Stalin in a speech entitled [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences]].  In the [[de-Stalinization]] campaign that followed, all buildings and towns that had been named for him were renamed, pictures and statues were destroyed.  Although in some respects Khrushchev was a reformer and allowed the emergence of a certain amount of intra-party dissent, his commitment to reform was thrown into doubt with the brutal use of military force on the civilian population of Hungary in 1956 during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the [[March 9 massacre in Tbilisi, 1956]].

By the late 1960s, the people of several eastern bloc countries had become discontented with the human and economic costs of the Soviet system, Czechoslovakia especially so. As a result of the growing discontent, the Communist Party began to fear a popular uprising.  They initiated reforms to attempt to save the regime, but eventually relied on help from the Stalinists in Russia. In 1968, [[Alexander Dubček]] initiated what is known as the [[Prague Spring]], ending [[censorship]] of the press and decentralizing production decisions, so that they were to be made not by central planners but by the workers and managers of the factories. People were to be allowed to travel abroad. Brezhnev reacted by announcing and enforcing what became known as the [[Brezhnev doctrine]]: {{quote|When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism the suppression of these counter-revolutionary forces becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries.|author=The 'Brezhnev doctrine', 1968}}

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Honecker.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Erich Honecker]]]] --&gt;
In August 1968, pursuant to this announcement, Soviet troops occupied Czechoslovakia. The following year, the Ukrainians responded to a campaign of passive disobedience on the part of the Czech populace by arranging the replacement of Dubček as first secretary. The new first secretary, [[Gustáv Husák]], would prove more compliant. He presided over a 'cleansing' of the Czech Communist Party and the introduction of a new constitution.

The early 1970s saw a period of [[détente]]. The [[arms race]] between the United States and the Soviet Union slackened. Brezhnev worked with US President Richard Nixon to negotiate and implement the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty]] of 1972. Brezhnev also scored some diplomatic advances with the [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] world, such as a 1971 friendship pact with India, and the close relations the Soviet Union enjoyed with several [[Arab]] countries after Soviet material support in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973. After his death in 1982, Brezhnev was succeeded by [[Yuri Andropov]], who died in 1984, and then [[Konstantin Chernenko]], who died in 1985.  Andropov's brief tenure as General Secretary indicated that he might have had reformist plans, and though Chernenko put them aside, Andropov had had time to groom a group of potential reformist successors, one of whom was [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

It was also during Andropov's tenure and this period of generational turmoil that the rule of Communists next door, in Poland, came under challenge from Solidarność, or [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], a labor union under the leadership of [[Lech Wałęsa]]. The union was sufficiently threatening to the government that on 13 December 1981, the head of state, [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] declared [[martial law]], suspended the union, and imprisoned most of its leaders.

==Final years for the Soviet Union (1985–1991)==
[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] (born 1931), who took control in 1985, was the first Soviet leader to have been born after the October revolution.  He is remembered for three initiatives: ''[[glasnost]]'', ''[[perestroika]]'', and the "[[Sinatra doctrine|Frank Sinatra doctrine]]".

''Glasnost'', or "openness", was Gorbachev's term for allowing public debate in the Soviet Union to an unprecedented degree.

''Perestroika'' was his term for market-oriented economic reforms, in recognition of the stagnating effects of central planning.

The "Frank Sinatra" doctrine was his reversal of the Brezhnev doctrine.  Sinatra sang "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]", and the doctrine named for him was that each Warsaw Pact country could find its own "way" of doing things.

Gorbachev also, in 1989, withdrew Soviet troops from their engagement in [[Afghanistan]], ten years after Brezhnev had sent them there. They had been fighting the anti-government [[Mujahideen]] forces which since 1979 as part of its cold war strategy had been covertly funded and trained by the United States government through the Pakistani secret service known as [[Inter Services Intelligence]] (ISI).

By August 1991, anti-reform Communists in both the Party and the military were sufficiently desperate to attempt a military coup.  Coup leaders called themselves the Committee on the State of Emergency. They announced that Gorbachev had been removed from his position as president due to illness.

Although the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup]] rapidly collapsed and Gorbachev returned to Moscow, it was [[Boris Yeltsin]] who had played a leading role in the street resistance to that Committee, and the incident marked a shift of power away from Gorbachev toward Yeltsin.  By the end of that year, Yeltsin was the leader of Russia, and the Soviet Union was no more.

==China (1945–1965)==
[[File:Mao Zedong portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]]]]
Through the Second World War, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] government of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] lived in an uneasy truce in order to combat the common foe, the Japanese occupation.

Upon the [[Surrender of Japan]], the [[Chinese Civil War]] immediately resumed.  Another truce, negotiated by American general [[George C. Marshall]] early in 1946, collapsed after only three months.

While war raged in China, two post-occupation governments established themselves next door, in [[Korea]].  In 1948, [[Syngman Rhee]] was proclaimed president of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] (South Korea), at [[Seoul]], while the Communist [[Workers Party of North Korea]] in the north proclaimed the establishment of the [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea).

In January 1949, the Chinese Nationalist armies suffered a devastating defeat by the Communists at [[Tianjin|Tientsin]].  By spring, Chiang Kai-shek, now losing whole divisions by desertion to the Communists, began the removal of remaining forces to Formosa ([[Taiwan]]).  In August, U.S. aid to the Nationalists ended due to Chiang's regime, which was corruption.  In October, Mao Zedong took office as the Chairman of the Central People's Administrative Council of the [[People's Republic of China]] in [[Beijing]].  [[Zhou Enlai]] was named premier and foreign minister of the new state.

The nascent People's Republic did not yet control all of the territory of the Republic of China. Mao declared it his goal in 1950 to "liberate" [[Hainan]], [[Tibet]], and [[Taiwan|Formosa]], and while he accomplished that of the first two, the third was interrupted: On 25 June 1950, the forces of North Korea invaded the South unleashing the [[Korean War]].  The [[United States Seventh Fleet]] was summarily dispatched to protect Formosa from a mainland Red Chinese invasion.  Although Mao was apparently unenthusiastic about that war, a [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese volunteer force]] entered the Korean War in November.

Claiming a victory against colonialism in the Korean War stalemate, the Communist government in China settled down to the consolidation of domestic power. During the 1950s, they redistributed [[real property|land]], established the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]], and attempted mass industrialization, with technical assistance from the Soviet Union.  By the mid-1950s, after an armistice in Korea and the surrender of French forces in Indochina, China's borders were secure.  Mao's internal power base was likewise secured by the imprisonment of those he called "left-wing oppositionists".

As the 1950s ended, Mao became discontented with the status quo.  On the one hand, he saw the Soviet Union attempting "peaceful co-existence" with the imperialist Western powers of [[NATO]], and he believed China could be the center of worldwide revolution only by breaking with Moscow. (Mao viewed then-Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] as a revisionist [i.e. not a true Communist] and a traitor to socialism.) On the other hand, he was dissatisfied with the economic consequences of the revolution thus far, and believed the country had to enter into a program of planned rapid industrialization known as the [[Great Leap Forward]].

The economic planning of the Great Leap period focused on steel{{spaced ndash}}because steel was considered emblematic of industry.  The government arranged to have small backyard steel furnaces built in communes, in the hope that the mobilization of the entire populace would compensate for the absence of the usual economies of scale.  During this period, Mao stepped down as head of state in favor of [[Liu Shaoqi]], but Mao remained [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]].

The rushed program of industrialization was a disaster.  It diverted [[Labour (economics)|labor]] and resources from agriculture to marginally productive cottage industry and so contributed to years of famine.  It also caused a loss of Mao's influence upon the Communist Party and government apparatus.  Modernizers such as Liu and [[Deng Xiaoping]] sought to relegate him to the status of figurehead.

Mao was not ready to be a figurehead.  In the early 1960s he gathered around himself the so-called "Shanghai Mafia" consisting of his fourth wife, [[Jiang Qing]] (a.k.a. "Madame Mao"), as well as [[Lin Biao]], [[Chen Boda]], and [[Yao Wenyuan]], unleashing the [[Cultural Revolution]].

In the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) since 1967, the terms [[Ultra leftism|Ultra-Left]] and left communist refers to political theory and practice self-defined as further "[[Left-wing politics|left]]" than that of the central [[Maoist]] leaders at the height of the GPCR ("[[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]]"). The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century [[Chinese anarchist]] orientations. As a slur, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has used the term "ultra-left" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further "left" than the [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC [[Central Committee]] denounced as "ultra-left" the line of [[Mao Zedong]] from 1956 until his death in 1976. "Ultra-Left" refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central [[Maoist]] line by identifying an [[antagonistic contradiction]] between the CPC-PRC [[party-state]] itself and the [[Hoi polloi|masses]] of workers and "peasants"&lt;ref&gt;"Peasant (农民)" was the official term for workers on [[people's commune]]s. According to the Ultra-Left, both peasants and (urban) workers together composed a [[proletarian]] [[Social class|class]] divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution.&lt;/ref&gt; conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the Party's mediation, the Ultra-Left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however "red" a given bureaucrat's "thought" might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary "ideas" and "habits" among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to "turn over a new leaf" after they had undergone "[[Thought reform in the People's Republic of China|thought reform]]," the Ultra-Left argued that "cultural revolution" had to give way to "political revolution"&amp;nbsp;– "in which one class overthrows another class".&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.marxists.de/china/sheng/whither.htm "Whither China?"] by Yang Xiguang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 70s Collective, ed. 1996. ''China: The Revolution is Dead, Long Live the Revolution''. Montreal: Black Rose Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialism in China since the Cultural Revolution==
In 1965, Wenyuan wrote a thinly veiled attack on the deputy mayor of Beijing, Wu Han. Over the six months that followed, on behalf of ideological purity, Mao and his supporters purged many public figures, Liu Shao-chi among them.  By the middle of 1966, Mao had not only put himself back into the center of things, he had initiated what is known as the Cultural Revolution, a mass (and army-supported) action against the Communist Party apparatus itself on behalf of a renovated conception of Communism.

Chaos continued throughout China for three years, particularly due to the agitations of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] until the CCP's ninth congress in 1969, when Lin Biao emerged as the primary military figure, and the presumptive heir to Mao in the party.  In the months that followed, Lin Biao restored domestic order, while diplomatic efforts by Zhou Enlai cooled border tensions with the Soviet Union.  Lin Biao died under mysterious circumstances in 1971.

Mao's final years saw a notable thaw in the People's Republic's relations with the United States, the period of "[[Ping Pong Diplomacy]]".

Mao died in 1976, and almost immediately his ideological heirs, the [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]] lost a power struggle to more "pragmatic" figures such as Deng Xiaoping. The term "pragmatic" is often used in media accounts of these factional struggles but should not be confused with the philosophy of [[pragmatism]] proper.

Deng launched the "[[Beijing Spring]]",  allowing open criticism of the excesses and suffering that had occurred during the Cultural Revolution period. He also eliminated the class-background system, under which the communist regime had limited employment opportunities available to people deemed associated with the pre-revolutionary landlord class.

Although Deng's only official title in the early 1980s was chairman of the central military commission of the CP, he was widely regarded as the central figure in the nation's politics.  In that period, [[Zhao Ziyang]] became premier and [[Hu Yaobang]] became head of the party.

Near the end of that decade, the death of Hu Yaobang sparked a [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|mass demonstration]] of mourning students in [[Tiananmen Square]], Beijing.  The mourning soon turned into a call for greater responsiveness and liberalization, and the demonstration was captured live on cameras to be broadcast around the world.  On May 30, 1989 students erected the "[[Goddess of Democracy]]" statue, which looked a bit like [[Statue of Liberty|Lady Liberty]] in New York harbor.

On 4 June 1989 under the orders of Deng Xiaoping, troops and tanks of the People's Liberation Army ended the protest.  Thousands were killed in the resultant massacre.

By the start of the 21st century, though, the leadership of China was embarked upon a program of market-based reform that was more sweeping than had been Soviet leader Gorbachev's perestroika program of the late 1980s, which is tracable to Deng's [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]].

It is in this context that [[Leo Melamed]], chairman emeritus and senior policy adviser to the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], spoke to the 2003 Beijing Forum on China and East Asian Prospects of Financial Cooperation on September 23. He said that the CME applauds the National People's Congress for recognizing their country's need for additional trading in [[futures contract]]s.

==21st century democratic socialism in Latin America==
Since the 1998 election of [[Hugo Chávez]] as President in Venezuela and the beginnings of his "[[Bolivarian Revolution]]" aimed at creating greater equality, Latin American nations have seen a [[pink tide|tide]] of democratically elected socialist and centre-left governments emerge. They have been elected in increasing numbers as the poor and middle classes of many countries have become increasingly disillusioned with the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies still encouraged by the United States and as a very large gap continues to exist between rich and poor, denying millions of people basic opportunities and necessities.

A long and very controversial history of [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. military and political intervention]] in the region dating back to the 19th century has severely tarnished the image of the United States in the eyes of many Latin Americans and shapes governments' policies to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blakeley|first=Ruth|date=2009 |title=State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The North in the South|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415462402/|location= |publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=rft8AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 20-23], [https://books.google.com/books?id=rft8AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 91-92] |isbn=0415686172}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example of the influence of the aforementioned sentiment was the [[Latin American and Caribbean Congress in Solidarity with Puerto Rico's Independence]], an international summit held at [[Panama City]], [[Panama]], in which fifteen incumbent political parties (in government) requested that the United States "relinquish its colonial rule over said island-nation and recognize Puerto Rico's independence".

Chavez is joined by the [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] president of [[Bolivia]], [[Evo Morales]] (that nation's first indigenous leader), who has adopted strong reformist agendas and attracted overwhelming majority electoral victories. The democratically elected president of [[Ecuador]], [[Rafael Correa]] is also an ally of Chavez. Correa describes himself as a [[humanism|humanist]], [[Christian Left|Christian of the left]] and proponent of [[socialism of the 21st century]].

A number of centre-left/social democratic presidents have also come to power in Latin American countries recently promising a greater redistribution of wealth within the framework of the [[free market]]. They include [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] of [[Argentina]], [[Lula da Silva]] of Brazil, [[Michelle Bachelet]] of [[Chile]], [[Tabaré Vázquez]]  of [[Uruguay]], [[Alan García]] of [[Peru]], [[Álvaro Colom]] in [[Guatemala]] and [[Fernando Lugo]] of [[Paraguay]]. The majority of these governments are still enjoying high approval ratings in their nation's public opinion polls. In [[Nicaragua]]'s 2006 elections the former [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] President [[Daniel Ortega]] was re-elected President after having been out of office since 1990.

In Colombia's previous presidential elections, [[Carlos Gaviria Díaz]] of the socialist [[Alternative Democratic Pole]] came in second place to [[Álvaro Uribe]] of [[Colombia First]], a conservative party. While in Peru's previous presidential election Alan García's main challenger was [[Ollanta Humala]] of the [[Union for Peru]], a leftwing Peruvian nationalist with close ties to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. The results of the [[Peruvian general election, 2006|2006 Peruvian election]] were close. In [[El Salvador]], the [[FMLN]] a former left-wing guerrilla group which once fought against a military dictatorship is now the official opposition to the Salvadoran government.

Other parts of the [[developing world]] have also seen a rise in radical socialist parties and movements. In [[Nepal]] following the end of the [[Nepalese Civil War|Civil War]], the formerly militant [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] and the more moderate [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)]] have emerged as the two most powerful opposition parties in the country. In Nepal's [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2008|2008 Constituent Assembly elections]] the Maoists emerged as the largest party allowing them to form an interim government. Their leader, [[Prachanda]] has vowed to respect [[multiparty democracy]].

In some of the poorest parts of India, the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]] has also been fighting a violent insurgency against the Indian government; a similar rebellion is being waged by the Maoist, [[New People's Army]] in the [[Philippines]].

==The emergence of a New Left in the developed world==
In many [[developed nations]] the rise of [[Third Way]] policies and the increase in capitalism and free-market economies&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-decline-of-socialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/capitalism-in-cuba-its-closer-than-the-u-s-may-think/&lt;/ref&gt; has led to the rise of many new socialist parties. They include [[Sinn Féin]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] (they also represent the Nationalist constituency of Northern Ireland), [[The Left (Germany)|The Left of Germany]], [[Syriza]] in Greece, [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain, [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party of Sweden]], [[New Zealand Progressive Party]], [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party of Ireland]], [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party of the Netherlands]], [[Respect Party]] of the United Kingdom, [[Scottish Socialist Party]] and [[Québec solidaire]] in the Canadian province of [[Quebec]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4288">'''Human rights in Abkhazia''' are granted by Chapter II of its [[Constitution of Abkhazia|Constitution]] which makes reference to adherence of [[Abkhazia]] to [[UDHR]], [[ICCPR]] and [[ICESCR]] (Article 11).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapba.de/Constitution.html Constitution of Abkhazia]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Abkhazia is not a UN member state and is not a party of UN human rights treaties, unlike Georgia, whose sovereignty over Abkhazia is [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|recognized]] by a bigger part of the international community.

Abkhazia was classified as ''partly free'' by the [[Freedom House]], its 2009 report naming corruption, problems in the legal system and the unresolved Georgian refugee problem as the main human rights issues.&lt;ref name=ff&gt;[[Freedom House]] [http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2009&amp;country=7744 report] on Abkhazia, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing of Georgians]] took place in Abkhazia; many ethnic Georgians remain displaced persons to this day.
==Domestic and international institutions==

A post of Human Rights Commissioner (as of 2008 — [[Gueorgui Otyrba]]) exists under the President of Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abkhaziagov.org/en/news/detail.php?ID=6169 President ratified legal base of activity of Human rights commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Human Rights Office Abkhazia, Georgia (HROAG), was established in 1996 to protect and promote human rights there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/georgia/22954.html The Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]//OSCE Mission to Georgia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
{{main|Media in Abkhazia}}

There are several independent newspapers and one independent [[Radio SOMA|SOMA]] radio station; electronic media are partially controlled by the state.&lt;ref name=ff/&gt;

On 21 September 2009 journalist Anton Krivenyuk was sentenced by the [[Sukhumi]] city court to a three-year suspended prison sentence for libel of president [[Sergei Bagapsh]]. On 8 June Krivenyuk had written an article for a Russian website which was widely republished in Abkhazian newspapers in which he criticised Bagapsh's decision to hand over control of the [[Abkhazian railway]] to Russia. Krivenyuk was the first journalist to be prosecuted in Abkhazia since the fall of the Soviet Union, and his conviction was seen by some other journalists as part of a government crack-down on independent media in the run-up to the [[Abkhazian presidential election, 2009|December 2009 Abkhazian presidential election]].&lt;ref name="iwpr_threat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=356144&amp;apc_state=henh|title=Abkhaz Media Fear Free Speech Under Threat|last=Gogoryan|first=Anaid|date=2009-09-25|publisher=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution and ethnicity==
The Constitution allows only to persons of Abkhaz ethnicity to be President of Abkhazia (Article 49; in the aforementioned translation words ''Abkhazian nationality'' are used, however, for citizens, another term is used — ''citizen of the Republic of Abkhazia'', like in Article 38.

An '''information repository''' is an easy way to deploy a secondary tier of [[data storage device|data storage]] that can comprise multiple, networked data storage technologies running on diverse [[operating system]]s, where data that no longer needs to be in primary storage is protected, classified according to captured [[metadata]], processed, de-duplicated, and then purged, automatically, based on data service level objectives and requirements. In information repositories, data storage resources are virtualized as composite storage sets and operate as a [[Federation (information technology)|federated]] environment.

Information repositories were developed to mitigate problems arising from [[data proliferation]] and eliminate the need for separately deployed data storage solutions because of the concurrent deployment of diverse storage technologies running diverse operating systems. They feature centralized management for all deployed data storage resources. They are self-contained, support heterogeneous storage resources, support resource management to add, maintain, recycle, and terminate media, track of off-line media, and operate autonomously.

==Automated data management==
Since one of the main reasons for the implementation of an Information repository is to reduce the maintenance workload placed on IT staff by traditional data storage systems, information repositories are automated. Automation is accomplished via policies that can process data based on time, events, data age, and data content. Policies manage the following:
*File system space management
*Irrelevant data elimination (mp3, games, etc.)
*Secondary storage resource management
Data is processed according to media type, [[Storage virtualization|storage pool]], and [[data storage device|storage technology]].

Because information repositories are intended to reduce IT staff workload, they are designed to be easy to deploy and offer configuration flexibility, virtually limitless extensibility, redundancy, and reliable failover.

==Data recovery==
Information repositories feature robust, client based data search and recovery capabilities that, based on permissions, enable end users to search the information repository, view information repository contents, including data on off-line media, and recover individual files or multiple files to either their original [[Computer network|network]] computer or another network computer.

A [[Philology|philologist]] by education, she graduated from the Faculty of Western Literature at [[Tbilisi State University]] in 1984.

Married to the prominent Georgian politician [[Giorgi Chanturia]], she was a member of the [[National Democratic Party of Georgia]] (NDPG) and participated in several protest actions against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule in the late 1980s. Appointed Deputy [[Prime Minister of Georgia|Prime Minister]] (1993–94), she headed the NDPG faction (second largest faction at that time) in the Georgian parliament from 1992 to 1999.

After the assassination of her husband in 1995 (she herself was seriously wounded in the attack), she was elected Chairperson of the NDPG. Prior to the 2003 parliamentary elections, she became a spokesperson of the pro-governmental bloc "For a New Georgia". She called on President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] to use tough measures against the mass demonstrations that led to Georgia's [[Rose Revolution]] in November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeopshouse.com/newsite/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=232:2010-10-22-14-44-25&amp;catid=88:2010-10-07-13-50-54&amp;Itemid=298&amp;lang=US House of Free Opinion meets with Irina Sarishvili - Chanturia]&lt;/ref&gt; After Shevardnadze's ouster, she resigned as chairperson of the NDPG and formed an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] to oppose [[Mikheil Saakashvili]]'s government. Currently she plays no significant role in the nation's political life.

"'''''{{lang|fr|Je suis Charlie}}'''''" ({{IPA-fr|ʒə sɥi ʃaʁli}}, {{Language with name/for|2=French|3="I am Charlie"}}) is a slogan and logo created by French art director Joachim Roncin and adopted by supporters of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]] after the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|7 January 2015 shooting]] in which twelve people were killed at the offices of the French satirical weekly newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]''. It identifies a speaker or supporter with those who were killed at the ''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting, and by extension, a supporter of freedom of speech and resistance to armed threats. Some journalists embraced the expression as a rallying cry for the freedom of self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enisyavuz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jesuis05.png |title=image |publisher=enisyavuz.com |accessdate=8 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109002354/http://enisyavuz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jesuis05.png |archivedate= 9 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan was first used on Twitter. The website of ''Charlie Hebdo'' went offline shortly after the shooting and when it became live again, it bore the legend ''Je suis Charlie'' on a black background,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charliehebdo.fr |title=Charlie Hedbo Official Website |date=7 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120424/http://www.charliehebdo.fr/ |archivedate=7 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[PDF]] containing translations in seven languages was added shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150108050610/http://www.charliehebdo.fr/20150107171028368.pdf Archive of Charlie Hebdo ''Je suis Charlie'' translations pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was used as the [[hashtag]] #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie&lt;ref name=Cormack20150108&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Paris terrorist attack: Charlie Hebdo shooting video provokes social media backlash|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/paris-terrorist-attack-charlie-hebdo-shooting-video-provokes-social-media-backlash-20150108-12jvhf.html|accessdate=9 January 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Twitter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/je-suis-charlie-trends-people-4935086|work=Daily Mirror|title='Je suis Charlie' trends as people refuse to be silenced by Charlie Hebdo gunmen|author=Richard Booth|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as computer printed or hand-made placards and stickers, and displayed on mobile phones at vigils, and on many websites, particularly media sites.

Within two days of the attack, the slogan had become one of the most popular news hashtags in Twitter history.&lt;ref name="twitter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/09/technology/social/jesuischarlie-hashtag-twitter/index.html |title=#JeSuisCharlie becomes one of most popular hashtags in Twitter's history|work=[[CNNMoney]]|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=12 January 2015|author1=David Goldman |author2=Jose Pagliery}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Je suis Charlie'' was adopted worldwide, was used in music, displayed in print and animated cartoons (including ''[[The Simpsons]]''), and became the new name of a town square in France.

On 12 January, ''Charlie Hebdo'' revealed the cover of its 14 January issue, set to be published a week after the attacks began. The cover features a cartoon of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] shedding a tear while holding a ''Je suis Charlie'' sign, above the words ''"Tout est pardonné"'' ("All is forgiven").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/01/12/charlie-hebdo-reveals-next-cover-a-cartoon-of-prophet-muhammad-behind-the-sign-je-suis-charlie/ |title=Charlie Hebdo reveals first cover since attack: A 'prophet Muhammad' caricature, crying behind the sign, 'Je suis Charlie' |work=[[The Washington Post]] |author= Michael Cavna |date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and meaning==
About one hour after the attack, an image of the slogan was posted to Twitter by Joachim Roncin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=#JeSuisCharlie creator: Phrase cannot be a trademark |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-30797059 |publisher=BBC News |date=14 January 2015 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a French artist and music journalist for ''[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]'' magazine. Roncin says he created the image because he lacked words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lauren |last=Provost |date=7 January 2015 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2015/01/07/je-suis-charlie-origine-createur-joachim-roncin-slogan-logo-solidarite-charlie-hebdo_n_6431084.html |title=Je suis Charlie: qui est à l'origine de l'image et du slogan que le monde entier reprend par solidarité |language=French |newspaper=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/2015/01/08/01007-20150108ARTFIG00160-jesuischarlie-trois-mots-pour-symboliser-l-emotion-d-une-planete.php |title=#JeSuisCharlie utilisé dans plus de 3,5 millions de tweets |work=[[Le Figaro]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roncin said the phrase came to him naturally, because he regularly spends time with his son looking at ''Où est Charlie?'' books (the French language version of ''[[Where's Wally?]]'').&lt;ref name="20minutes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.20minutes.fr/medias/1512635-20150108-attaque-charlie-hebdo-jesuischarlie-histoire-cri-liberte |title=Un directeur artistique, à l'origine du slogan |work=[[20 minutes (France)|20 Minutes]] |date=8 January 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan is intended to evoke solidarity with the victims, as other similar phrases have done.  Such "I am" and "We are" slogans "express empathy, outrage, and horror by subsuming ourselves into victims' identities", wrote Amanda Hess of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.&lt;ref name="iam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/_jesuischarlie_the_default_mode_of_showing_solidarity_in_the_hashtag_age.html |title=#IAm: The default mode of showing solidarity in the hashtag era |author=Amanda Hess |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=9 January 2015 |accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; French media in particular noted its similarity to the phrase "Tonight, we are all Americans," (''"Ce soir, nous sommes tous Américains"'') spoken on air by [[France 2]] reporter [[Nicole Bacharan]] on the evening of 11 September 2001.&lt;ref name="20minutes" /&gt; The phrase was widely embraced, including being printed on the front page of French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' the following day. ''Je suis Charlie'' has also been compared to another phrase of solidarity, "''[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]''" ("I am a Berliner"), a declaration by U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] on 26 June 1963, in West Berlin on the 15th anniversary of the Berlin blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/story/96697/critiques-slogan-je-suis-charlie |title="Je suis Charlie", le bon slogan au bon moment |trans-title='Je suis Charlie', the right slogan at the right time| author=Xavier Landes |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=12 January 2015|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media also have drawn comparisons to the iconic "I'm Spartacus" scene in the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960),&lt;ref name="managementtoday"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/opinion/1328478/we-not-charlie-hebdo/ |title=We are not Charlie Hebdo: Opinion |publisher=managementtoday.co.uk |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[I Am a Man!]]" slogan used during African American civil rights marches in 1968, or the use of "I am Michael Brown" after the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="I am slogan"/&gt; &lt;!-- not supported by any reference: as well as more recent protests slogans and trending hashtags like "[[We are the 99%]]" and "[[Trayvon Martin|I am Trayvon Martin]]", "[[Death of Eric Garner|I can't breathe]]". --&gt; The phrase is also similar to "Main hoon aam aadmi" meaning "I am the common man" slogan used by the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] in India.&lt;ref name="iam" /&gt;

===Reaction to violence against journalists===
[[File:Lines Against Terror.jpg|thumb|Indian cartoonist [[Shekhar Gurera]] along with his fellow cartoonists protested and expressed solidarity with victims of attack by drawing their creations at the [[Press club]] of [[India]], New Delhi on 9 January 2015]]
[[File:Marche hommage Charlie hebdo et aux victimes des attentats de janvier 2015 (9).jpg|thumb|With "''Liberté de la Presse''" ([[Freedom of the press]]) in Paris on {{Nowrap|11 January 2015}}]]
Beyond expressing sympathy for the victims, within hours of the attack the hashtag was used by journalists discussing the issue of censorship and threats. Sophie Kleeman of [[Mic (media company)|Mic]] wrote, "#JeSuisCharlie sends a clear message: Regardless of the threat of hatred or violence, journalists and non-journalists alike refuse to be silenced. As [[Charb]]onnier said in 2012, following the firebombing of his offices, 'I have neither a wife nor children, not even a dog. But I'm not going to hide.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mic.com/articles/107888/je-suis-charlie-stands-up-for-free-speech-after-attack-on-french-magazine |title=#JeSuisCharlie Stands Up for Free Speech After Deadly Attack on French Magazine |author=Sophie Kleeman |date=7 January 2015|publisher=Mic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of Gene Policinski, chief operating officer of the [[Newseum|Newseum Institute]] and Senior Vice-President of the [[First Amendment Center]], the ''Charlie Hebdo'' killings were part of a string of recent threats toward journalists and freedom of speech, following [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack|North Korea's threats]] over the release of the film ''[[The Interview]]'' (2014) and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]'s executions of journalists. In his opinion, Policinski stated that instead of being successful at silencing anyone, these attempts at censorship and the Paris massacre have backfired and instead brought more awareness and support to freedom of speech. "Ironically, such violence directed at journalists, authors and others is recognition that free expression and the marketplace of ideas—enshrined in the U.S. [Constitution] in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]—is a powerful weapon against tyranny", he wrote; "For more than 220 years, in the U.S., the 45 words of the First Amendment have defined the nation's core freedoms of religion, speech, press, assembly and petition. We now have another few words that will serve as a global means of declaring those freedoms: #JeSuisCharlie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gazettextra.com/20150107/first_amendment_jesuischarlie8212another_way_to_say_8216freedom8217 |title=First Amendment: #JeSuisCharlie—another way to say 'freedom' |author=Gene Policinski |publisher=Gazette Extra |date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Peter Bella wrote that more than 100 reporters were killed "doing their jobs" in 2014 and that "many were executed just because they were journalists." He said the hashtag "was created to support ''Charlie Hebdo'', the victims, and freedom of the press, speech, and expression. I am Charlie. You are Charlie. We are all Charlie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/interesting-chicago/2015/01/jesuischarlie-the-price-of-freedom-is-never-too-high |title=#JeSuisCharlie: The price of freedom is never too high |author=Peter Bella |publisher=ChicagoNow|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''"Je ne suis pas Charlie"''===
Counter-hashtags also appeared as expressions of disagreement with the unconditional support of ''Charlie Hebdo''. The hashtag #JeNeSuisPasCharlie ("I am not Charlie") was used by those who accuse the magazine of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201501081423-0024476|title=Charlie Hebdo hashtags reveal defiance, solidarity and Islamophobia |first=Gene |last=Policinski |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2015/01/08/jenesuispascharlie-a-rebours-lemotion-collective-twitter-256969|title=#JeNeSuisPasCharlie : à rebours de l'émotion collective sur Twitter |author=Hadrien Bajolle |publisher=L'Oubs |date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news |title=Why the popularity of #killallmuslims is not all it seems |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-30728491|accessdate=8 January 2015 |publisher=BBC News|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Monde'' reported that a fake bomb was left in the faculty lounge of a French high school containing the message: "Je ne suis pas Charlie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/10/a-saint-denis-collegiens-et-lyceens-ne-sont-pas-tous-charlie_4553048_3224.html |title=A Saint-Denis, collégiens et lycéens ne sont pas tous " Charlie "|first1=Mattea |last1=Battaglia |first2=Benoit |last2=Floc'h |publisher=Le Monde.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.francetvinfo.fr/faits-divers/attaque-au-siege-de-charlie-hebdo/minute-de-silence-pour-charlie-hebdo-la-difficile-tache-des-profs-dans-certains-colleges_792855.html |title=On ne va pas se laisser insulter par un dessin du prophète, c'est normal qu'on se venge|author=Francetv info |work=francetv info}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled "I Am Not Charlie Hebdo" published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', American journalist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]], while describing the journalists at ''Charlie Hebdo'' as "martyrs on behalf of freedom of expression," described ''Charlie Hebdo'' as a puerile magazine whose offensive humor would be labelled as [[hate speech]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/opinion/david-brooks-i-am-not-charlie-hebdo.html|title=I Am Not Charlie Hebdo |first=David |last=Brooks |date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; News media also used the slogan "Je ne suis pas Charlie" to discuss why they chose not to publish any ''Charlie Hebdo'' cartoons as part of their news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/free-speech-advocates-can%27t-guilt-trip-me/  |title=Free speech advocates can't guilt-trip me |work=NOW Magazine  |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others used the "Je ne suis pas Charlie" slogan to make a comparison between the loud outcry over the attacks in Paris, and the comparatively smaller outcry over other atrocities going on in non-Western countries that took place at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Christian Today |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/david.robertson.je.ne.suis.pas.charlie.je.suis.charlene/46107.htm |title=David Robertson: Je ne suis pas Charlie, Je suis Charlene |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While condemning the murders of the 17 people in Paris, British [[Respect Party|Respect]] politician [[George Galloway]] considered the Charlie cartoons to be "pornographic, obscene insults to the Prophet and by extension, 1.7&amp;nbsp;billion humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Selby|first1=Jenn|title=George Galloway condemns 'racist, Islamophobic, hypocritical rag' Charlie Hebdo at freedom of speech rally|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/george-galloway-condemns-racist-islamophobic-hypocritical-rag-charlie-hebdo-at-freedom-of-speech-rally-9990490.html|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=The Independent|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===
In a ''[[The New Yorker]]'' essay, [[Teju Cole]] objected to the claim that ''Charlie Hebdo'' cartoonists and writers were equal opportunity offenders; to him, the magazine, in recent years, had taken a turn "specifically for racist and Islamophobic provocations (...) featuring hook-nosed Arabs, bullet-ridden Korans, variations on the theme of sodomy, and mockery of the victims of a massacre". Furthermore, he also posited that the outpouring of support for ''Charlie Hebdo'' was only possible because the attack fits in a pre-established narrative wherein Western lives are worth more, and which sees that violence that befalls the Third World and/or has Western allies as accomplices is paid comparatively little attention. Cole also rebuked the view that "violence by self-proclaimed Jihadists is the only threat to liberty in Western societies", stating that the very governments of France, the US, and the UK undermine free speech within their own societies via monitoring and punishment of dissidents and critics of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/unmournable-bodies |title=Unmournable Bodies |last1=Cole |first1=Teju |date= 9 January 2015|website=The New Yorker|access-date= 21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole was among the writers who boycotted the [[PEN American Center]]'s May 2015 gala as an award to ''Charlie Hebdo'' was due to be presented at the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/27/peter-carey-among-writers-to-protest-pen-honour-for-charlie-hebdo|date=27 April 2015|work=The Guardian|title=Peter Carey among writers to protest PEN honour for Charlie Hebdo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glenn Greenwald]] accused supporters of ''Je Suis Charlie'' of either keeping silence about, or downright supporting, what he sees as free speech violations perpetrated by the French state in the year that followed the massacre, including the following events: the arrest of comedian [[Dieudonné M'bala M'bala]] for hate speech, and of further dozens of people for "acts insulting religious faiths, or for cheering the men who carried out the attacks"; the criminal conviction, by France's highest court, of pro-Palestinian protesters for having advocated a [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|boycott of Israeli products]] at a supermarket; the shutting down of mosques and coffee shops; and France's use of "emergency powers", after the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], to ban a rally by environmental activists in protest to the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] which was taking place in the French capital. He has accused most ''Je Suis Charlie'' supporters of being, not true advocates of free speech rights, but anti-Muslim agitators who used the massacre at the magazine's headquarters as a "cynical weapon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/01/08/where-were-the-post-hebdo-free-speech-crusaders-as-france-spent-the-last-year-crushing-free-speech/ |title=Where Were the Post-Hebdo Free Speech Crusaders as France Spent the Last Year Crushing Free Speech? |last1=Greenwald |first1=Glenn|date=8 January 2016 |website=[[The Intercept]]|access-date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald has cited in his support the work of French sociologist [[Emmanuel Todd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2015/10/27/criminalization-of-anti-israel-activism-escalates-this-time-in-the-land-of-the-charlie-hebdo-free-speech-march/|title=Anti-Israel Activism Criminalized in the Land of Charlie Hebdo and "Free Speech" |last1=Greenwald |first1=Glenn|date=27 October 2015 |website=[[The Intercept]]|access-date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd claims that the marches on 11 January 2015 to show solidarity with the ''Charlie Hebdo'' victims were not an expression of positive French values but of right-wing and anti-immigrant elements in France. The biggest of such protests, says Todd, "had occurred in the country's most historically Catholic and reactionary regions", with the working class and children of immigrants being notably absent therefrom. In 2015 Todd published a book expanding on his view named ''Qui est Charlie? Sociologie d'une crise religieuse'' ("Who is Charlie? Sociology of a religious crisis"), which has become his most controversial and popular essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/28/emmanuel-todd-the-french-thinker-who-wont-toe-the-charlie-hebdo-line|title=Emmanuel Todd: the French thinker who won't toe the Charlie Hebdo line|work=The Guardian|date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Android, apps appeared to display the various versions of the "Je suis Charlie" slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonesreview.co.uk/2015/01/13/je-suis-charlie-app-for-android-and-iphone-shows-solidarity/|title=Je Suis Charlie app for Android and iPhone shows solidarity|work=Phones Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; French developers from the news agency Nice-Matin launched a ''Je suis Charlie'' smartphone app for iOS and Android. Installing the free app and giving it access to the phone's location adds a dot on a map alongside other supporters. While new iOS apps typically take at least a week to be vetted, the agency e-mailed Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] and the app was approved in one hour after the shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/je-suis-charlie-app-shows-worldwide-support-french/story?id=28167153 |title='Je Suis Charlie' App Shows Worldwide Support for French Terror Attack Victims |author=Alyssa Newcomb |date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/12/je-suis-charlie-app/ |title=French app to show support for Je Suis Charlie campaign approved in one hour after contacting Tim Cook |work=9to5mac |date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial use===
Within days of the attack, merchandise featuring ''Je suis Charlie'' was available for sale around the world. This led to critical questioning of whether businesses were profiting off the tragedy or simply responding to market demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/10/news/je-suis-charlie-merchandise/ |title=Retailers walk line with 'Je Suis Charlie' merchandise|work=[[CNNMoney]]|date=10 January 2015|accessdate=12 January 2015|author1=Cristina Alesci |author2=Kate Trafecante}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 12 January, [[eBay]] had more than 5,000 items on its site, including T-shirts, mugs, artwork, pins, posters, hats, phone cases, keychains and dogtags.

On 8 January, French mail order company [[3 Suisses]] drew criticism for appropriating the slogan for social media self-promotion after tweeting an image with the words "Je ''Suisses'' Charlie." It removed the slogan the same day and apologized.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; eBay stated it would remove any items featuring the slogan that were "inconsistent with its regulations, principles and values."&lt;ref name="lemonde9jan" /&gt; The Hoxton Hotel chain was criticized for including "#jesuischarile {{sic}}" in a Facebook post promoting its new Paris hotel.

On 16 January 2015, protests against the continued creation of cartoons depicting Muhammad turned violent in several countries, including [[Algeria]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Pakistan]]. Protesters shouted "I am not Charlie, I am Muhammad" and President of [[Turkey]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] stated that the cartoons had nothing to do with freedom of expression, but rather with "terrorising the freedom of others." In the city of [[Zinder, Niger|Zinder]], 4 died and 45 were wounded battling police.&lt;ref name="protests"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/01/16/anti-charlie-protests-turn-violent-in-niger-pakistan-and-algeria/|title=Anti-Charlie protests turn violent in Niger, Pakistan and Algeria |work=[[Euronews]] |date=16 January 2015 |accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the issue of ''Charlie Hebdo'' following the shooting ([[Charlie Hebdo issue No. 1178|''Charlie Hebdo'' issue No. 1178]]), a number of protests in Somalia and Pakistan, some of which used "{{Lang|fr|Je suis Muslim}}" (and "j'aime mon Prophete") slogans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914532/Anti-Charlie-Hedbo-protests-Somalia-Pakistan.html|title=Anti-Charlie Hedbo protests in Somalia and Pakistan – Daily Mail Online|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar use of the slogan was made in Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/je-suis-muslim-hundreds-rally-in-australia-over-portrayal-of-islam-and-prophet-mohamed-10000257.html|title='Je suis Muslim': Hundreds rally in Australia over portrayal of Islam and Prophet Mohamed|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
''Charlie Hebdo'' staff hastily created a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] of seven translations of ''Je suis Charlie'' which they made available on their website shortly after it returned to service.  The pages appear to be scans of laser printed output, and are in a variety of fonts.

Each translation is three words, where "I am" is a single word (or "am" has been elided), "Hebdo" has been added.

The '''Ader Doutchi Maggia Rural Development Project''' (PDR-ADM), better known as '''Keita Project''', is a development project in [[Keita Department]] in central [[Niger]]. The Project has taken place in four phases, the first starting in 1983 and the most recent beginning in 2003. It was run initially by the [[Italy|Italian]] government's [[Italian Development and Cooperation Bureau]], as part of its 'Italian Initiative for the Sahel', with significant help from the [[United Nations]]. The fourth phase is being run by the [[UNDP]]. As of September 2009, the Project has cost approximately US$88 million, with the majority of funding (US$66 million) coming from the Italian government.

The main objectives of the Keita Project are to increase [[food security]] and reverse [[desertification]] in the Ader, Doutchi and Maggia valleys of Keita Department, an area which faced environmental collapse from the 1970s; a secondary objective is to thereby to reduce the high rate of [[Human migration|migration]] from this region to Italy. The methods used have included [[reforestation]] and [[land reclamation]], building new infrastructure, setting up peasants' associations, and providing technical and financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;FAO (1995), The Keita Integrated Rural Development Project. FAO, [[Rome|Rome, Italy]], pp. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The results have been to stop and reverse falls in [[crop yield]]s and livestock numbers, to cover large areas of marginal land with forest and productive farmland, and to provide new sources of income from the land. However, desertification has continued to some degree and food security has not been fully achieved due to very high [[population growth]].

Because of the large area covered, its duration of three decades and the large amount of data collected, the Keita Project has been the subject of considerable study.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita-niger/keita.php?page=87&amp;action=D&amp;fnc=browse&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By the early 1980s Keita Department had suffered considerable loss of forest and agricultural land to the Sahara desert.

==Objectives==
{{Empty section|date = April 2013}}

==Phases==
* 1983: A plan is written for the Project
* 1984: First phase of the Project begins
* 2007: A new initiative (Fond Local de Développement de l’Ader Doutchi Maggia, FLD-ADM) starts with the objective of completing existing interventions, funding local investments and transferring the management and property to local institutions and organizations.

==Techniques==
The PDR-ADM operated in: ''reclamation of plateaux and abandoned lands in the valleys for agricultural and pastoral purposes'', ''reforestation of slopes, of the koris banks and dunes'', ''creation of wind breaks and forest areas'', ''control of the water flow in the koris by banks consolidation and small dams''.

Simultaneously, the Project has also addressed the social and [[economic development]] by building schools, medical centers, wells and roads, and providing technical assistance and financial support for the creation of new economic activities.

The main interventions of PDR-ADM from 1984 to 2008 are shown in the table below (MAE – DGCS, 2008):

==Environmental monitoring==
* 1995-1997: the Projet d’Evaluation des Interventions de Conservation et de Récupération de l’Environnement (PEICRE) - Italian Cooperation – builds an [[Information system|Information System]] on Keita in order to evaluate and to monitor the interventions.
* 1997: Keita is identified by ROSELT [http://www.oss-online.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=229&amp;Itemid=368] (Réseau d’Observatoires et de Surveillance Ecologique à Long Terme) as one of the priority places in Niger for desertification monitoring. 
* 1999-2000: realization of an Information System to Sustain Evaluation Analysis and Planning; FAO-Italian Cooperation-CeSIA.
* 2001: launching of Keita Observatory through the Projet d'Appui à la Formation et d'Assistance en Gestion de l’Environnement (PAFAGE)[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/pafage/index.php] financed by Italian Cooperation [https://web.archive.org/web/20081220224037/http://www.cooperazioneallosviluppo.esteri.it/pdgcs/]. 
* 2002: IBIMET-CNR studies in the context of three United Nation major conventions (UNCCD-UNCBD-UNFCCC), about Keita potentiality in the [[Carbon dioxide sink|carbon sequestration]] [http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita-niger/data/file/keita_brochure.pdf]. 
* 2006: Launching of KeitaLAB [http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita-niger/index.php] by IBIMET-CNR [http://www.ibimet.cnr.it], FCS and Politecnico di Torino [http://www2.polito.it/ricerca/cctm/] in collaboration with the PDL-ADM.

Even if the PDR-ADM focused on land management, it has not deeply considered environmental monitoring. Consequently, since 1995, many initiatives have been conceived and begun to address this monitoring deficit. CASE-Ibimet [http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it] institutions have been involved in Keita for 10 years. Keita has been chosen as a privileged environment in the drylands in order to answer to [[open problem]]s in the [[Scientific method|scientific research]] and [[International development|development cooperation]] fields:  
* Are climatic changes definitive or are they the expression of cyclic phenomena?
* What kind of pressure can [[natural resource]]s sustain in these areas? How and in how much time could the pressure be modified?
* What kind of new relationships could be created between man, the economy and the environment in the future?
* Which kinds of techniques are the most appropriate for recovering degraded environmental resources and to preserve those at risk?
* How can this recovery be achieved in an efficient and economically profitable way ? What are the sustainability guarantees of these interventions?
* How to research a veritable partnership in the delivery of rural development programs?

==Impact==
The impact of PDR-ADM interventions on the environment has been monitored by a multi- temporal analysis of land cover. Changes in land cover are the result of synergies of different factors (climate changes, interventions of PDR-ADM and demographic pressure). The environmental status before the beginning of the project testifies the negative impact of climate and anthropic pressure on the ecosystems. In 1962, the slopes of the highlands were forested but in 1972 some signs of degradation started to be evident until 1984 when the forest completely disappeared. Between 1984 and 2002, a progressive recovery of the natural vegetation has appeared &lt;ref&gt;Di Vecchia A., Pini G., Sorani F., Tarchiani V., Keita, Niger: the impact on environment and livelihood of 20 years fight against desertification , pp. 16 [http://www2.polito.it/ricerca/cctm/wp/WP26.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately, the diachronic land cover study shows that between 1984 and 2002 woodlands increased more than 300% (10.000 ha in 1984 to 45.000 ha in 2002) against a reduction in the shrubby steppes of the 30%. This tendency is supported, besides the PDR-ADM intervention, also by the progressive increase of rainfall, which was recorded as from the years '90.

Even if the same dynamics are observed in the entire Sahelian part of Niger, this trend has only reached such results in Keita, because of the PDR-ADM intervention and the control of the human pressure on natural resources. In addition to wooden natural vegetation recovery, there has also been an evident increase of agricultural surfaces (about 80%) resulting of the substitution of large grassland areas (decreased about 70%) and of PDR-ADM [[land reclamation]] interventions (about 12.000 ha). These data confirms that the tendency of natural vegetation recolonisation is reduced by the increase of the human pressure.

Particularly, valley and glacis are exposed to higher agriculture pressure and the trend is to the extensification of croplands. This happens in three ways: the first one, by restoration of degraded lands; the second is by reclamation of grasslands and the last one by clearing of woody vegetation. The first method, supported by the PDR-ADM, concerns the slopes of the Keita valley and also the sandy dunes of the eastern plateaux. Land reclamation of grasslands has been pushed by demographic pressure especially in the Keita and Insafari valleys. Woody vegetation clearing happens especially in the secondary valleys where demographic pressure was low before 1984 and strongly increased later. On the other hand, woody vegetation restoration interests large areas on the slopes and also in the valleys as gallery forests. This trend on the slopes is particularly interesting where it is not directly due to Project interventions (plantation in trenches), because it shows the effectiveness of the watershed approach and the [[water management]] on plateaux and slopes. 

Croplands degradation is also observed, due mostly to [[Eolian processes|wind erosion]] and sand accumulation. It gives evidence to the fact desertification is still active even if PDR-ADM interventions reduced its effects. In this context, the territory monitoring in the aspects that could indicate a reactivation of the desertification is very important, especially in this phase where the environment is slowly recovering equilibrium.

===Improvement of land productivity===
The pressure derived from the population growth is nowadays one of the main desertification factors, as consequence the classic environmental approach to fight desertification is doomed to fail if it is not joined with actions aimed to reduce the pressure through the creation and diversification of sources of income for the population.
The productivity is assessed considering the main products contributing to population livelihood: agriculture, forestry, and livestock. Regarding agriculture, only rain-fed cereals have been considered. Concerning plantations, only the bloc ones as tranchées and banquettes are analysed.

In 2003 the whole project area produced about 40.000 tons of wood compared to 1984 production of about 17.000 tons, with a variation of 133%. The availability of leaf biomass is also increased, about of 57%. 

In 1984, cereals production was about 39.000 tons while in 2003 it reached 55.000 tons .  Vis-à-vis with these variations, the pressure on the natural resources also strongly increased generally more than productions, as demonstrate by population and livestock growth  about 50% during the period.

Articles 4 and 114 of the [[Constitution of Latvia]] form the foundation for '''language policy in Latvia''', declaring [[Latvian language|Latvian]] to be the official state language and affirming the rights of ethnic minorities to preserve and develop their languages. [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] and the [[Livonian language]], in addition to Latvian, are considered indigenous and all other languages foreign, including [[Russian language|Russian]] (the [[first language]] for more than one third of the population&lt;ref name="2000 census results"&gt;[http://data.csb.gov.lv/DATABASEEN/tautassk/databasetree.asp?lang=1 2000 census results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321200854/http://data.csb.gov.lv/DATABASEEN/tautassk/databasetree.asp?lang=1 |date=21 March 2008 }} — choose "Results of Population Census Year 2000, in short" and "Iedzīvotāju dzimtā valoda un citu valodu prasme"{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Other significant minority foreign languages include [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Romani language|Romani]].

The preamble to the State Language Law includes as its goals "the integration of national minorities into Latvian society while respecting their right to use their mother tongue or any other language; [and] the increase of the influence of the Latvian language in the cultural environment of Latvia by promoting a faster integration of society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minelres.lv/NationalLegislation/Latvia/Latvia_Language_English.htm State Language Law] — Sections 1, 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
The [[official language]] (''valsts valoda'', literally ''state language'') in Latvia is Latvian; this status has been explicitly defined since 1988.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=167|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, amendments to the 1989 Law on Languages strengthened the position of Latvian. All other languages, except the [[Extinct language|extinct]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/fu.html|title=Uralic (Finno-Ugrian) languages|website=Helsinki.fi|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livonian language]], are defined as foreign languages in Section 5 of the State Language Law of 1999.

Since 1998, the official status of the Latvian language has been written into the [[Constitution of Latvia|Constitution]] (Article 4); and since 2002, MPs have been asked to promise to strengthen Latvian as the only official language in order to take their seats (Article 18). In the Constitution's chapter on human rights, rights to get answers from authorities in Latvian are specified since 2002 (Article 104). The current State Language Law was not amended since its adoption in 1999 (as at 2017).

In 1995, Latvia signed, and in 2005 ratified the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]. When ratifying it, the Latvian [[Saeima]] (Parliament) made two declarations (worded as reservations) limiting the implementation of Articles 10 and 11. As at 2008, Latvia did not plan to sign the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-latvia/16808b58b3 Third report on Latvia] by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]], 2008 — see Paragraph 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Language policy is implemented by a number of institutions: the State Language Commission (under the [[President of Latvia|President]]) prepares proposals in this field; the [[Latvian State Language Center|State Language Centre]] (under the Ministry of Justice) executes control, imposes fines for administrative violations and translates documents of international significance, the Latvian Language Agency (under the Ministry of Education and Science) provides consultations and opportunities for learning the Latvian language, analyses the language situation.

== Official use of languages ==

Since the State Language Law came into force in 2000, submitting documents to government (local included) and state public enterprises is allowed in Latvian only, except in cases specially defined in the law (emergency services, foreign residents etc.), according to Section 10. From 1992–2000, authorities had to accept documents in Russian, German and English, too, and were allowed to answer in the language of application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=165 1992 Law on Languages] — Sections 8, 9{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the losses of the Latvian government in the cases ''[[Podkolzina v. Latvia]]'' ([[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]]) and ''[[Ignatāne v. Latvia]]'' ([[Human Rights Committee|UN HRC]]), a certain level of command in Latvian was asked for eligibility to Parliament and local councils. In practice, this had led to re-examinations of various candidates, at least sometimes unexpected, which prevented Ignatāne and Podkolzina (representatives of the [[Equal Rights (Latvia)|Equal Rights]] party in the 1997 local and 1998 parliamentary elections&lt;ref&gt;''Жданова Д.'' ООН встала на защиту «Равноправия», «Час» 10.08.01.{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from participation.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} - This is exactly what the mentioned ''Iganatane'' and ''Podkolzina'' cases are about - see, e.g., Para 7.4. in ''Ignatane'', Para. 36 in ''Podkolzina'' judgment--&gt; As of 2011, candidates do not need to prove language proficiency, but elected members of Saeima&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saeima.lv/en/legislation/rules-of-procedure|title=Rules of Procedure|website=saeima.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local councilors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=58052&amp;from=off Law on status of member of republican city or municipality council — See Section 4]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be deprived of mandate for insufficient command of Latvian.

Names and surnames in Latvian-issued documents are formed in Latvianized form, according to Section 19. These provisions were subject in ECHR cases ''Kuhareca v. Latvia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=721719&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECHR decision in case No. 71557/01]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mencena v.

Latvia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.microlink.lv/pipermail/minelres/2007-July/005184.html|title=MINELRES: Communication to the UN HRC: minority names spelling in Latvia|website=Lists.microlink.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toponyms are formed in Latvian language only (on the [[Livonian coast]] - in Livonian as well), according to Section 18 of the State Language Law.

The Electronic Mass Media Law&lt;ref name="Law on Electronic Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Likumi/Electronic_Mass_Media_Law.doc|title=Electronic Mass Media Law|website=Vvc.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; orders to use only Latvian language in the first channels of public radio and television, and basically Latvian language in their second channels (Section 66).

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Latvia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Language policy is an important issue in Latvia: here, demonstrators demand official status for the Russian language.]] --&gt;
The government of Latvia in its policy documents refers to Latvia as a (democratic) [[nation state]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integracija.gov.lv/doc_upl/VP_SIL.pdf State programme "Social integration in Latvia"]{{lv icon}} - see p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.km.gov.lv/UI/imagebinary.asp?imageid=3124 Guidelines of cultural policy 2006-2015 "Nation state"]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructing societal integration on the basis of the Latvian language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integracija.gov.lv/doc_upl/VP_SIL.pdf State programme "Social integration in Latvia"]{{lv icon}} - see p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; while respecting the diversity of languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valoda.lv/doc_upl/VVA_angl.pdf Guidelines of the State Language Policy for 2005-2014] — p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unity (Latvian political party)|Unity block]], comprising most of the governing coalition as of 2011, also describes Latvia as a nation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvk.lv/cgi-bin/wdbcgiw/base/komisijas2010.CVKAND10.progr?NR=5|title=Programma|website=Cvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the nation state, where "language = nation", is seen as the core and main engine of the language policy of the Latvian state.&lt;ref&gt;''Dilāns G.'' [http://www.politika.lv/index.php?id=6172 Valodas politika — vai 2004. gada reformas dziļākais pamatojums ir objektīvi analizēts?]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics draw parallels between measures of the Latvian government and the assimilation of linguistic minorities in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;''Dilāns G.''

One critic, James Hughes, Reader in Comparative Politics at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], has pointed out that Russian-speakers in Latvia constitute one of the largest linguistic minorities in Europe, therefore he considers Latvia's language laws to be denying Russophones their language rights, and thus they are contrary to international practice in the field of minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |title=Discrimination against the Russophone Minority in Estonia and Latvia |accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=James Hughes |year=2005 |work=Development &amp; Transition |publisher=[[London School of Economics]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504025222/http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |archivedate= 4 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nataliya Pulina in ''[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]'' asserts that Latvia's Russophones are by percentage actually the largest linguistic minority in the [[European Union|EU]] whose language has no official status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Наталия |last=Пулина |script-title=ru:Татьяна Жданок: "Русские могут влиять на политику Латвии" |url=http://www.mn.ru/issue/2007-45-33 |work=[[Moskovskiye Novosti|Московские новости]] |language=Russian |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2008-03-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080326223109/http://www.mn.ru/issue/2007-45-33 |archivedate = 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the demographic arguments for Russian language rights in Latvia, the [[BBC]]'s Angus Roxburgh reported in 2005:
{{cquote|There are as many Russians, proportionally, in Latvia as there are French speakers in Belgium. They argue that, being such a large minority, they should have the right to education in their native language if the demand exists—which it certainly does.&lt;br&gt;[They] say that Russian should be an official language with equal rights, just as Swedish is in Finland (for just 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Angus |last=Roxburgh |title=Latvian lessons irk Russians |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4380437.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-03-29 |accessdate=2008-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the political parties, [[ForHRUL]] offers in its programme to grant co-official status to Russian, Latgalian and possibly others languages in municipalities where these are native for more than 20% of population.&lt;ref&gt;ForHRUL programme (2006) — see section 7.5.: [http://rusojuz.lv/ru/party/programma/14661-/ Russian], [http://rusojuz.lv/lv/party/Programmas/24543-/ Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; In a draft of its political programme,&lt;ref&gt;HC programme project – section "Cultural and language diversity": [http://www.saskanascentrs.lv/index.php?text&amp;id=100&amp;level=1 Russian], [http://www.saskanascentrs.lv/index.php?text&amp;id=100&amp;level=1 Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harmony Centre|HC]] offers to grant co-official status to Latgalian and Russian in printed media, public sphere and education (for Russian, in communication with authorities, as well), stressing its support for the sole state language. Both these parties are in permanent opposition on the state level.

On the other hand, TB/LNNK, a member of governing coalition between 2006 and 2010, is demanding that Latvian be made the sole language of instruction, even in minority schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tb.lv/index.php?id=382|title=Jaunumi|website=Tb.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research conducted by the Baltic Institute of Social Sciences in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bszi.lv/downloads/resources/Etnopol_krize/Atskaite_LV.pdf Ethnopolitical tension in Latvia: looking for solving the conflict — see p. 39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509041733/http://www.bszi.lv/downloads/resources/Etnopol_krize/Atskaite_LV.pdf |date=9 May 2007 }} {{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority (77%) of ethnic Latvians opposed (56%) or mostly opposed (21%) granting Russian status as a second official language, while the majority (87%) of Russians supported (59%) or mostly supported (28%) such status, while a majority (75%) of other ethnicities also supported (40%) or rather supported (35%) such status.
(Sample size was 1,018 respondents, with 51% supporting or rather supporting official status for Russian and 44% opposing or rather opposing it.)

==Private use of languages==
The Law on Electronic Media&lt;ref name="Law on Electronic Media"/&gt; prescribes that national and regional electronic media need to broadcast at least 65 % in Latvian language (section 32). Besides, films aired in any channel should be dubbed in Latvian or to have original soundtrack and Latvian subtitles; TV broadcasts in languages other than Latvian, except news, live events, language learning broadcasts and retranslated content, must be subtitled in Latvian.(Section 28). The same concerns films shown in cinemas, according to Section 17 of State Language Law. Until a judgement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2003/01/2003-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgement in case No. 2003-02-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitutional Court upon request of 24 ForHRUL MPs (delivered in 2003), broadcasting in minority languages was limited for private TV and radio (originally within 30%, since 1998 within 25%).

According to Section 6 of State Language Law, levels of skills in Latvian are defined for various professions, which concern legitimate public interest. Totally, there are six levels and two lists of professions (longer for public sector and shorter for private sector), classified by needed level. For those who didn't get education in Latvian and aren't disabled, an examination is needed to define their skills in Latvian, to work in these professions. Those who fail to show needed level during inspections, can be fined. Labour market shows high demand for skills in Latvian, Russian and English languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valoda.lv/doc_upl/A5_VVA_valodu_prasmes_LV_Q.pdf Valodu prasmes ietekme uz ekonomiski aktīvo iedzīvotāju dzīves kvalitāti], 2006{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Section 11 of State Language Law, organizers of public events have to provide in Latvian information, which concerns legitimate public interest (defined in Section 2 — public safety, health care ''et cetera'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=10124|title=Noteikumi par tulkojumu nodrošināšanu pasākumos|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same affects posters, billboards and signboards, according to Section 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=DOC&amp;id=102667|title=Noteikumi par valodu lietošanu informācijā|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, according to the Law of languages as amended in 1992 (Section 5), organizers of any public event had to provide translation into Latvian in their conferences. An exemption had existed for organizations of ethnic minorities and religious organizations; 1997 Law on Meetings, Processions and Pickets has foreseen free choice of language in meetings, pickets and processions, too (Section 19).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=KDOC&amp;id=42090&amp;version_date=13.02.1997|title=Par sapulcēm, gājieniem un piketiem|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of the 1990s, some Polish language schools were created besides the existing schools with Latvian and Russian language of instruction. Certain schools (e.g., Riga Dubnov Jewish Secondary school, founded in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revs.lv|title=Š. Dubnova Rīgas ebreju vidusskola|website=Revs.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Riga Ukrainian Secondary School, founded in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrschool.lv/|title=Rīgas Ukraiņu vidusskola|website=Ukrschool.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had originally used Ukrainian as language of instruction, but switched to Latvian in 1993/1994&lt;ref&gt;''Puķītis M.''

As at 2007, there was also increasing number of minority children attending Latvian-language schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-latvia/16808b58b3 Third report on Latvia] by ECRI — see Paragraph 54&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Education law,&lt;ref&gt;Education law: [http://www.ttc.lv/index.php?&amp;id=10&amp;tid=59&amp;l=LV&amp;seid=down&amp;itid=13759 edition being in force between 27.02.2004. and 15.09.2005., English] and [http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=50759&amp;menu_body=KDOC current version, Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; as adopted in 1998, the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) had to be only Latvian since 2004. This has mostly affected Russian schools, some existing in Latvia without interruption since at least 1789.&lt;ref&gt;''Гурин А. Г.'' [http://www.russkije.lv/ru/journalism/read/pervye-russkie-shkoly/ Первые русские школы]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Russian School Defense Staff|wide protests in 2003 and 2004]], the law was amended allowing to teach up to 40% of curricula in minority languages (Transition Rules) and allowing orphans to continue their education not only in Latvian, but also in the language he or she began it (Section 56).

In 2005, one judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/2005-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgment in case No. 2005-02-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitutional Court (upon request of ForHRUL, NHP and LSP MPs) has declared unconstitutional the ban of public co-funding for private minority schools, another&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/2004-18-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgement in case No. 2004-18-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has declared the proportion "60+:40" constitutional.

According to the same 1998 Education Law, the tertiary education in public colleges and universities has to be in Latvian only since 1999 (it had to be basically in Latvian since the second year, according to 1992 Law on Languages, Section 11). In fact, there still exist programmes with education in English for foreigners ([[Riga Technical University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtuasd.lv/resource/show/3|title=Riga Technical University Department of Foreign Students|website=Rtuasd.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or according to special laws ([[Riga Graduate School of Law]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=124716&amp;mode=DOC 2005 Latvian-Swedish Treaty on Riga Graduate School of Law] - See Article 7; there is a version in English under one in Latvian&lt;/ref&gt;). There is a demand for tertiary education in Russian, too: it is used, for example, at the [[Baltic International Academy]].

In 2018, President [[Raimonds Vejonis]] promulgated the bill banning use of Russian as the language of instruction also at private universities in Latvia. The Latvian parliament passed the legislation on June 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/education/?doc=141364&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
&lt;!-- {{main|Language legislation in Latvia}}--&gt;
[[File:Обязательство Государственнаго Казначейства Латвии 100 рублей 1919.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A banknote of the Republic of Latvia, 1919]]
[[File:Обязательство Государственнаго Казначейства Латвии 100 рублей 1919 реверс.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A banknote of the Republic of Latvia, 1919]]

In the medieval [[Livonian Confederation]], [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] were the dominant languages of education and administration. German kept this position under subsequent periods of rule by [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and, initially, under the [[Russian Empire]]. German was the language of instruction in the first institution of tertiary education on the territory of Latvia ([[Riga Polytechnicum]], founded in 1862). In [[Latgale]], the Polish language gained some influence, beginning from the 16th century.

From the mid-19th century, Latvian started to rise in influence. At the end of the 19th century, tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] instigated a policy of [[Russification]] in non-Russian areas of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Russia |last= Raisanovsky |first= Nicholas V. |authorlink= Nicholas V. Riasanovsky |year= 1993 |edition= 5th |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York; Oxford |isbn= 0-19-507462-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, language of administration, that of Riga Polytechnicum and most schools was changed from German to Russian, and some German toponyms in eastern Latvia were Russianized (e.g., Dünaburg became Dvinsk). After the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 revolution]], possibilities for schooling in Latvian increased.

The pro-[[Bolshevik]] revolutionary [[Soviet (council)|soviet]], [[Iskolat]], declared on 4 January 1918 that Latvian should be the primary language of administration on the territory of Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=170|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the short-lived [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic]] in 1919, Latgalian enjoyed co-equal status with both Latvian and Russian as an official language of administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=169|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Latvia (founded in 1918) was initially liberal in its language policy: while Latvianizing toponyms (e.g., Dvinsk became [[Daugavpils]]), it also allowed Russian and German languages to be used in Parliament along Latvian,&lt;ref&gt;Saeimas kārtības rullis. "Valdības vēstnesis", 27.03.1923. — 145. pants{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saeimas kārtības rullis, "Valdības vēstnesis", 10.04.1929. — 147. pants{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledged minorities' rights to learn in schools in their mother tongues&lt;ref&gt;Likums par Latvijas izglītības iestādēm.

State had acknowledged public use of Latgalian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=26&amp;id=238|title=Valsts valoda - Ministru kabineta noteikumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1934 [[Kārlis Ulmanis|Ulmanis]] coup d'état the policy changed, and many minority high schools were closed.&lt;ref&gt;''Фейгмане Т. Д.'' Русские в довоенной Латвии — Р.: БРИ, 2000. {{ISBN|9984-606-68-6}} — стр. 281—296 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly hard hit were the Belarusian primary schools, all but 5 of which were closed. Belarusian schoolteachers and other intellectuals in Latvia were suspected of having a pro-Soviet agenda harmful to national security.&lt;ref&gt;''Latvijas izlūkdienesti 1919-1940: 664 likteņi'', ed. Vija Kaņepe (Riga: LU žurnāla "Latvijas Vēsture" fonds, 2001), {{ISBN|978-9984-643-29-8}}, pp. 240–1. {{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Latvia's German community was mostly moved to Germany, and the Jewish community was destroyed (hit first by the Stalinist deportations in 1941, then by the [[Holocaust]]). Due to that, these groups' respective schools disappeared.

In the postwar [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the proportion of Latvian-speaking population decreased due to large losses in World War II and mass deportation, while the Russian-speaking population increased due to the presence of military forces and mass immigration of labour to implement the Soviet Union's industrialization policy (still, due to low birth rate, the population of Latvia had grown by 27.4% between 1959 and 1989 censuses, while that of the whole USSR — by 36.8%).&lt;ref&gt;''demoscope.ru'' database: population of USSR and its republics (by ethnicity) — [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_59.php 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172652/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_59.php |date=16 March 2010 }}, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172713/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php |date=16 March 2010 }}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the use of Russian increased and it started to dominate in the areas integrated on a federal level (state security, railway etc.). As concerns tertiary education, in some faculties, the language of instruction was only Latvian, in some, only Russian; in some there were two language "streams".&lt;ref&gt;Latvijas PSR augstākās mācību iestādes. Rīga: Latvijas Valsts izdevniecība, 1960. 106. lpp.{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Stalinism, Polish schools were closed and after [[Arvīds Pelše]]'s 1959 victory over the "national communists" ([[Eduards Berklavs]] ''et al.''), the last Latgalian newspaper was closed.&lt;ref&gt;''Зейле П.''

Latvian was declared the state language of the Latvian SSR by a decree of the republican [[Supreme Soviet]] on 6 October 1988. Nevertheless, citizens could still choose to communicate with state authorities in Russian, and all correspondence with the USSR's federal bodies was to be in Russian.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Demographic background ==
&lt;!--{{main|Languages of Latvia}}--&gt;
In the first post-Soviet [[census]] in 2000, 1,311,093 persons in Latvia reported Latvian as their mother tongue,&lt;ref name="Census"/&gt; representing the vast majority of the estimated 1.5 million Latvian speakers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lav|title=Latvian|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, [[Livonian language|Livonian]] was a [[moribund language]] spoken by some 35 people, of whom only 10 were fluent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nyelvrokonaink |last=Nanovfszky |first=György (ed.) |year=2000 |publisher=Teleki László Alapítvány |location=Budapest |isbn=963-00-3424-7 |language=Hungarian, Russian |oclc=45621804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decade of the 21st century, it was estimated that Livonian was the native tongue of 4 people in Latvia, all of whom were older than 70.&lt;ref&gt;''Ernšreits V.'' [http://www.livones.lv/libiesi/valoda/?raksts=168 The Liv language today] (published between 2005 and 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Grizelda Kristiņa]], the last native speaker of Livonian, died on June 2, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/death-of-a-language-last-ever-speaker-of-livonian-passes-away-aged-103-8k0rlplv8xj|title=Death of a language: last ever speaker of Livonian passes away aged 103|first=David|last=Charter|website=Thetimes.co.uk|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latvia's current territory is a close approximation to the range of Latvian habitation since the Latvian people emerged. As such, Latvian and Livonian are native only to Latvia.&lt;!-- and have been given special status under Latvian law with the intent to counter the policy of Russification under the Soviet Union--&gt;

In the 2000 census, 891,451 respondents listed Russian as their mother tongue,&lt;ref name="Census"/&gt; representing 37.5% of the total population, whereas Latvian was recorded as the mother tongue for 58.2%.&lt;ref name="2000 census results"/&gt; Latvian was spoken as a second language by 20.8% of the population, and 43.7% spoke Russian as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;LR CSP preses izlaidums: [http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.doc?type=doc&amp;serial=1022597092498 2000.

In age groups over 15 years, however, more Latvians expressed proficiency in Russian than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=470|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 71% of ethnic Latvians said they could speak Russian, and 52% of Russians could speak Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=389|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all districts and cities in Latvia, the highest command of Latvian was in [[Talsi District]] (98.8%), while the lowest was in Daugavpils (41.4%). In Daugavpils was also the highest percentage of people speaking Russian (95.7%), and in [[Kuldīga District]] the lowest (57.6%). There was a similar breakdown with regards to mother tongue: 94.6% in Talsi District and for 11.6% in Daugavpils for Latvian, 80.4% in Daugavpils and for 3.0% in Talsi District for Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=388|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the previous 1989 census, conducted while Latvia was still part of the USSR, Latvian was reported as the native language for 52.0% of the population, Russian for 42.1%;&lt;ref&gt;1989. gada tautas skaitīšanas rezultāti Latvijā.

It should be noted that [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] was not considered a language separate from Latvian in any census, whether during the Soviet period, or since the restoration of independence. Therefore, no specific data on the number of its native speakers were available until the 2011 census. Then, 8.8. % of the population indicated they use Latgalian, described as a variety of Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/notikumi/home-latvian-spoken-62-latvian-population-majority-vidzeme-and-lubana-county-39158.html|title=At home Latvian is spoken by 62% of Latvian population; the majority – in Vidzeme and Lubāna county - Latvijas statistika|website=Csb.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] found Latvia's new language law to be "essentially in conformity with Latvia's international obligations and commitments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/item/4702.html |title=High Commissioner welcomes State Language Law in Latvia |accessdate=2008-03-29 |author=OSCE Press Statement |year=1999 |publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he stated that the government regulations were "essentially in conformity with both the Law and Latvia's international obligations", but that "specific matters will have to be reviewed upon Latvia's anticipated ratification of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/media/attachments/30/01/2012/Cilvektiesibas_Latvija_2000_1.pdf Human Rights in Latvia in 2000] [[LCHRES]] — p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The ratification took place in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4900">A '''minister-president''' or '''minister president''' is the [[head of government]] in a number of European countries or subnational governments with a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] or [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] system of government where he or she presides over the council of ministers. It is an alternative term for [[prime minister]], [[premier]], [[chief minister]], or [[first minister]] and very similar to the title of [[president of the council of ministers]].

==Terminology==
In English-speaking countries, similar institutions may be called premiers or first ministers (typically at the subnational level) or prime ministers (typically at the national level). The plural is sometimes formed by adding an ''s'' to ''minister'' and sometimes by adding an ''s'' to ''president''.

The term is used, for instance, as a translation ([[calque]]) of the German word ''Ministerpräsident'',&lt;ref&gt;common nouns are capitalized in German, though they are sometimes lowercased when referred to in English texts.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Austria ==
From 1867 to 1918, the first minister of the government was known as ''Ministerpräsident'' (minister-president), before that ''[[Staatskanzler]]'' (chancellor of state). Today the head of the [[Austrian Federal Government]] is called the [[Chancellor of Austria|''Bundeskanzler'']] (federal chancellor), while the head of a state government is called the ''[[Landeshauptmann]]'' (literally "state captain"), not ''Ministerpräsident''.

See: [[List of Ministers-President of Austria]].

== Belgium ==
The term minister-president ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''minister-president'', [[French language|French]]: ''ministre-président'', [[German language|German]]: ''Ministerpräsident'') is also used in [[Belgium]] to describe the head of government of a Belgian [[Communities, regions and provinces of Belgium|region or linguistic community]], but not the head of the [[Belgian federal government]] who is referred to as the [[Prime Minister of Belgium|prime minister]] (Dutch: ''eerste minister'', French: ''premier ministre'', German: ''Premierminister'').

According to the [[Belgian constitution]], the federal prime minister is appointed by the king, and approved by the federal parliament with a vote of confidence (in practice the king usually appoints the leader of the winning party as ''"formateur"'' to form a government). The federal ministers later swear an oath of allegiance to the king. The ministers-president of the regions and linguistic communities are not appointed by the king, but are directly appointed by their respective parliament. Ministers of the regions and linguistic communities are not required to swear allegiance to the king but simply take an oath in their respective parliament.

See:
* [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region]]
* [[Minister-President of Flanders]]
* [[Minister-President of the French Community]]
* [[Minister-President of the Walloon Region]]
* [[Minister-President of the German-speaking Community]]

== Germany ==
The Minister President is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government|government]] of a [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|state]].

{{Further|Minister President (Germany)}}

== Hungary ==
The title of Hungary's [[Prime Minister of Hungary|head of government]] in Hungarian is ''miniszterelnök'' which literally translated means "minister-president". However, because "prime minister" or "premier" is the more usual title in a parliamentary system for a head of government in English-speaking nations, " miniszterelnök" is almost always translated as "prime minister."

== Netherlands ==
In the [[Netherlands]] the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|prime minister]] is officially referred to as "minister-president", although the informal term "premier" is also frequently used. His responsibilities are defined in the constitution of 1848 as the "voorzitter van de ministerraad" (chair of the council of ministers). The title of minister-president has been in use since 1945 and officially added to the constitution in 1983.

== Norway ==
In [[Norway]], [[Vidkun Quisling]], head of the [[Quisling regime|collaborationist government]] from 1942 to 1945 during the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation]] in [[World War II]], held the title of Minister-President (in Norwegian, ''ministerpresident'').

==Spain==
In Spain, the head of government is known as "presidente del gobierno" or President of the Government but in English, he is more commonly referred to as the [[Prime Minister of Spain|prime minister]].

'''''Moral Man and Immoral Society: A Study in Ethics and Politics''''' is a 1932 book by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], an American [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Theology|theologian]] at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] (UTS) in [[New York City]].{{sfn|Pianko|2010|p=117}} The thesis of the book is that people are more likely to [[sin]] as members of groups than as individuals.{{sfn|Crouter|2010|p=48}} Niebuhr wrote the book in a single summer.{{sfn|Rasmussen|1981|p=10}} He drew the book's contents from his experiences as a pastor in [[Detroit]], Michigan prior to his professorship at UTS.{{sfn|Gill|2006|p=143}} The book attacks [[liberalism]], both [[Secular liberalism|secular]] and [[Religious liberalism|religious]], and is particularly critical of [[John Dewey]]{{sfn|Rice|1993|p=17}} and the [[Social Gospel]].{{sfn|Stumme|2006|p=100}} ''Moral Man and Immoral Society'' generated much controversy and raised Niebuhr's public profile significantly.{{sfn|Brown|1987|p=xv}} Initial reception of the book by [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christian]] critics was negative, but its reputation soon improved as the rise of [[fascism]] throughout the 1930s was seen as having been predicted in the book.{{sfn|Dorrien|2003|p=459}} Soon after the book's publication, [[Paul Lehmann]] gave a copy to [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], who read it and was impressed by the book's thesis but disliked the book's critique of [[pacifism]].{{sfn|Bethge|1999|p=268}} The book eventually gained significant readership among [[American Jews]] because, after a period of considerable anti-theological sentiment among Jews in the United States, many Jews began to return to the study of theology and, having no Jewish works of theology to read, turned to Protestant theological works.{{sfn|Goldy|1990|p=53}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4668">The '''mothers' movement''' included [[ultra-conservative]], [[isolationist]] women's groups in the United States, beginning in [[California]] in 1939, soon after the start of World War II. At its height it consisted of 50 to 100 loosely confederated groups, with a total membership that may have been as high as five or six million. Members were typically white, middle class, middle aged Christian women.

They organised petitions and demonstrations, published propaganda, and were active in political campaigns. They are credited with having delayed US assistance to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Their activity declined after the [[Smith Act#1944: Great Sedition Trial|Great Sedition Trial]] of 1944, but their leaders' opposition to the war continued.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Jeansonne. Women of the Far Right: The Mother's Movement and World War II. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The movement originated in 1939 in [[Los Angeles, California]], with the National League of Mothers of America.&lt;ref&gt;Frost 2010, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; It gradually grew into a loose confederation of 50 to 100 groups that developed on the west coast, midwest, and east coast. The members of these groups were largely white, middle-aged, middle class Christian women; their leaders were exclusively college-educated upper middle class Christians. The groups published books, pamphlets, and newsletters opposed to the war. The members testified before congress, picketed the White House, collected petitions, and participated in political campaigns. The leaders most likely learned their organizing experience from women's clubs, political parties, or movements led by men.&lt;ref&gt;Jeansonne 1996, pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Great Sedition Trial===
The mother's movement was involved in the [[Great Sedition Trial of 1944]], in which the government charged an assortment of 30 heterogeneous individuals with violations of the [[Smith Act]] of 1940 and the [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Act]] of 1917; the defendants were held to be pro-fascist participants in a [[Nazi]] [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]]. [[United States President|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] pressured [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Francis Biddle]] to indict these activists for [[sedition]]. Some of the leaders that were called to testify before the [[grand jury]] were [[Elizabeth Dilling]], Cathrine Curtis, and Lyrl Clark Van Hyning.&lt;ref&gt;Jeansonne 1996, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; A mistrial was declared on November 29, 1944, some time after the death of the trial judge, ex-congressman [[Edward C. Eicher]].

===The end of the movement===
The Mother's Movement failed to accomplish its main goal of ending involvement in World War II, which led to the declining enthusiasm for the cause. The movement slowly diminished after World War II was over. The leaders of the movement mostly dispersed into different paths and most of them lost the distinction they once had during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Jeansonne 1996, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Liberation Front''' ([[Arab language|Arab]]: الجبهة القوميّة) or NLF was a [[Marxist]] [[paramilitary]] organization and a political party operating in the [[Federation of South Arabia]], (now southern [[Yemen]]) during the [[Aden Emergency]].  During the [[North Yemen Civil War]], fighting spilled over into South Yemen as the [[United Kingdom|British]] attempted to establish an autonomous colony known as the [[Federation of South Arabia]].  Following the exit of the [[British armed forces]], the NLF seized power from its rival, the [[Pan-Arabism|Arab nationalist]] [[Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen|Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY)]]. In the aftermath of the Emergency, the NLF reorganized itself into the [[Yemeni Socialist Party]] and established a [[single-party]] [[Marxist-Leninist government]], known as the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]].

==Background==
In the late 50s [[Republic of Egypt (1953-1958)|Egyptian]] [[President of Egypt|president]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s [[Pan-Arabism]] had spread to the region and threatened Britain and the traditional Emirs of the region's control.  In response the British were able to convince the feuding Emirs to merge into the [[Federation of South Arabia]].&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 126"&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1994|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the federation the [[Aden Trade Union Congress]] had a large influence in the new assembly and to prevent it seizing control of the Federation in 1962 the [[Colony of Aden]] joined the Federation so that Aden's pro-British assembly members could counter the ATUC's influence.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 126"/&gt;  The day after Aden joined the Federation [[Muhammad al-Badr]] of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|Yemenese monarchy]] was overthrown and [[North Yemeni Civil War|civil war]] ensued between forces backed by Nassar like the National Liberation Front (NLF) and monarchist forces backed by the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudis]] and British.  This conflict spread throughout the region becoming what the British would term as the [[Aden Emergency]] which officially began when a [[state of emergency]] was declared in the [[State of Aden]].&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 127"/&gt;

==Creation==
The anti-Royalist campaign for power spread to the ''Federation of South Arabia'' in 1964 when the NLF announced the start of their revolution.  In 1964 there was a new British government headed by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] after they won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|United Kingdom general election]].  They attempted to grant independence to the ''Federation of South Arabia'' by giving Abdullah al Asnag's FLOSY control of the country.  This proposal was annulled by the American [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] who didn't want Britain to withdraw while the Americans were escalating the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 127"&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1994|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the British suspended the ''Federation of South Arabian'' government and imposed direct colonial rule.  Realizing that the British weren't going to give him control Asnag fled the country and joined the NLF.  However elements of the NLF become more radical Marxist and they split from the Egyptians.&lt;ref name= "Dean p. 1211"&gt;{{harvnb|Dean|2004|p=1211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asnag formed his own military organization, FLOSY, in order to counter the NLF.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 127"/&gt;  The NLF quickly denounced Asnag and FLOSY as Imperialist forces under control of Nasser and in addition to attacking the British also engaged FLOSY in combat.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 127"/&gt;   By February 1967 the British could no longer control or protect its bases in Aden and announced it was leaving the country, against American wishes.&lt;ref name="Kitchen p. 127"/&gt;

In January 1967, there were mass riots by NLF and FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town, which continued until mid February, despite the intervention of British troops.  During the period there were many attacks on the troops, and an [[Aden Airways]] [[Douglas DC-3]] plane was destroyed in the air with no survivors.  At the same time, the members of FLOSY and the NLF were also killing each other in large numbers.  On 20 June 1967, there was a mutiny in the Federation of South Arabia Army, which also spread to the police.&lt;ref name= "Beeston-Simpson p. 84"&gt;{{harvnb|Beeston|Simpson|2007| p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Order was restored by the British, mainly due to the efforts of the 1st Battalion [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], under the command of [[Colin Campbell Mitchell|Lt-Col. Colin Campbell Mitchell]].&lt;ref name= "Beeston-Simpson p. 84"/&gt;

Nevertheless, deadly guerrilla attacks particularly by the NLF soon resumed against British forces.  Nasser threw its weight behind FLOSY and arrested the head of the NLF who was living at the time in Egypt.  Officially FLOSY and the NLF refused to talk to the leaving British forces as they didn't want to be seen as agents of British Imperialism.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 128"&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1994|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However unofficial secret talks were held between the British and the NLF who conspired to defeat FLOSY so that the much hated Nasser supported FLOSY would be defeated.&lt;ref name= "Mawby p. 173"&gt;{{harvnb|Mawby|2005|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the British withdrawing from Aden by the end of November 1967, earlier than had been planned by British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] and without an agreement on the succeeding governance.  When the last governor of Aden, [[Humphrey Trevelyan, Baron Trevelyan|Sir Humphrey Trevelyan]], left the country he had no one to give the keys to but as a point of respect had the government house repainted for whomever emerged victorious.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen p. 128"/&gt;

==Victory==
On November 30, 1967 the ''Federation of South Arabia'' ceased to exist when the [[People's Republic of South Yemen]] was proclaimed.  In 1967 Israel defeated Egypt in the [[Six-Day War]] thus obliging Egypt to evacuate its troops from Yemen. FLOSY, now without any military support from its Egyptian ally, continued fighting the NLF.  However FLOSY's fate was sealed when the NLF managed to persuade the Yemen's Federal army to join the fight against FLOSY. On November 7, 1967 FLOSY tried to attack a [[Aden Protectorate Levies|federal army]] base but the army defeated FLOSY with the NLF's help, inflicting heavy losses on FLOSY.  After the defeat FLOSY´s fighting force disbanded although some cadres and leaders remained outside the country.&lt;ref name= "Scott p. 171"&gt;{{harvnb|Kostiner|1984|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the opposing leaders reconciled by 1968, in the aftermath of a final royalist siege of San'a'.

==Post civil war==
[[Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi]] held the presidency until 22 June 1969, when a hard-line [[Marxism|Marxist]] group from within his own NLF seized control. [[Salim Rubai Ali (Salmin)]] replaced al-Shaabi.  After the civil war in 1970, Saudi Arabia recognized the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] and a ceasefire against remaining belligerents was put in place.  The NLF changed the name of South Yemen on 1 December 1970 to the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]] (PDRY). The NLF changed its name to the [[Yemeni Socialist Party]] (YSP) in 1978.&lt;ref name= "Colburn p. 79"&gt;{{harvnb|Colburn|2002|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All other political parties were amalgamated into the [[Yemeni Socialist Party]] (YSP), which became the only legal party.

The OPEC Fund for International Development ('''OFID''') is the intergovernmental development finance institution established in 1976 by the Member States of the [[OPEC|Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC).  OFID was conceived at the Conference of the Sovereigns and Heads of State of OPEC Member Countries, which was held in [[Algiers]], [[Algeria]], in March 1975. A Solemn Declaration of the Conference "reaffirmed the natural solidarity which unites OPEC countries with other developing countries in their struggle to overcome underdevelopment", and called for measures to strengthen cooperation between these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/ABOUTUS.aspx|title=About Us|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OFID's objective is to reinforce financial cooperation between OPEC Member Countries and other developing countries, by providing financial support to the latter for their socioeconomic development. The institution's central mission is to foster South-South Partnership with fellow developing countries worldwide with the aim of eradicating poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/ABOUTUS/VisionandMission.aspx|title=Vision and Mission|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; OFID's headquarters are located in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The current Director-General is '''Dr Abdulhamid Alkhalifa''' of [[Saudi Arabia]]. He assumed office as Director-General and Chief Executive Officer of OFID on November 1, 2018.

==OFID headquarters==
[[File:Sede del OFID en Viena.jpg|thumb|OFID Headquarters, [[Vienna]], Austria]]
The OFID Headquarters&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofid.org/Portals/0/Publications/Special%20Publications/HQ_A5_ENG_2014_Aug_web_o.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (located in [[Vienna]]'s first district, on the [[Ringstraße]]) was the residential palace of the Austrian [[Archduke Wilhelm Franz of Austria|Archduke Wilhelm Franz Karl]]. Built between 1864 and 1868 to the architectural design of [[Theophil von Hansen]], the palace was sold to the German Order of Knights ([[Teutonic Order]]) in 1870 and used as headquarters of the Grand Master, the last of whom was Archduke Eugen. From 1894, it served as the palace of both the Grand and German Masters, acquiring the name, ''[[Deutschmeister-Palais]]''. In 1938 following the dissolution of the German Order of Knights, the building was seized by National Socialist (Nazi) Germany and, in 1942, it was handed over to the police authorities. Between 1945 and 1975, it served as headquarters of the Vienna police. After an [[interregnum]], the building became the property of OFID.

==History==
Following the First OPEC Summit in [[Algiers]], [[Algeria]], in 1975, Member Countries expressed their commitment to assist the developing countries through a collective financial facility. As a result, in 1976, the Finance Ministers of Member Countries met and established the OPEC Special Fund, through which Member Countries would channel aid to developing countries. The OPEC Special Fund started its operations in 1976, with initial resources of about $800 million. By the end of 1977 it had extended 71 loans to 58 developing countries, and had channeled donations from its Member Countries to other development institutions, including the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) Trust Fund and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).

As a result of its successful performance, member countries decided in 1980 to convert the temporary facility into a permanent legal entity called the OPEC Fund for International Development; it became a permanent international development agency in May 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofid.org/Portals/0/Publications/Special%20Publications/AE-engl.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member countries==
OFID has 13 member countries: [[Algeria]], [[Ecuador]], [[Gabon]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Venezuela]]. Ecuador reactivated its membership in June 2014 after a 22-year absence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofid.org/ABOUT-US/Member-Countries&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means==
OFID provides financial assistance in a number of ways, with the distribution between the different types of aid changing over time as conditions in recipient countries evolve and needs alter. The methods of funding have included:
 
* Extending concessionary financial assistance in the form of loans for development projects and programs, [[balance of payments]] support and [[trade financing]]
* Financing private-sector activities in developing countries 
* Providing grants in support of technical assistance, food aid, research and similar activities, and humanitarian emergency relief
* Contributing to the resources of other development institutions whose work benefits developing countries
* Serving as an agent of OPEC Member Countries in the international financial arena whenever collective action is deemed appropriate

==Resources==
OFID's resources consist of voluntary contributions made by its member countries and the accumulated reserves derived from the institution's various operations. A replenishment of US$1 billion was approved in June 2011 by the institution's supreme authority, the Ministerial Council, as a direct response to the increasing needs of developing countries and the negative impact of the financial crisis on their economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/HOME/OFID-Profile|title=OFID Profile|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beneficiaries==
All developing countries are, in principle, eligible for OFID assistance, although the [[least developed countries]] are given higher priority and have received more than one-half of the institution’s cumulative commitments to date. Also eligible are international institutions whose activities benefit the developing countries.  OFID Member Countries are excluded from benefiting from assistance, except in the case of disaster relief or within the context of a regional program. Over the years, OFID has spread its presence to 134 countries,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofid.org/Portals/0/Documents/AboutUs/OFID_PartnerCountries.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of which 53 are in Africa, 43 in Asia, 31 in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 7 in Europe.

==Operations==
OFID's operations are organized into 10 focus areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS.aspx|title=Focus Areas|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Agriculture:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS/Agriculture|title=Agriculture|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding has helped boost crop and livestock production, as well as improve rural infrastructure, such as irrigation systems and storage facilities for animal fodder. Support has also been extended to help promote agricultural research.
*'''Education:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS/Education|title=Education|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; OFID's financing has helped construct and rehabilitate schools, purchase equipment and teaching materials, as well as provide teacher training. OFID has also sponsored the attendance of participants from developing countries to various conferences and workshops.
*'''Energy:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS/Energy|title=Energy|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lead partner in the UN’s [[Sustainable Energy for All]] initiative, OFID has supported energy projects ranging from infrastructure and equipment provision to research and capacity building.
*'''Financial:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS/Financial|title=Financial|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support to this sector has primarily been the channeling of funds to Micro-, small- and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) via financial intermediaries such as national and regional development banks, commercial banks and leasing companies.
*'''Health:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS/Health|title=Health|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support has included construction and modernization of hospitals, health clinics and other infrastructure. Capacity building and support to primary healthcare programs has also been extended. OFID is also an active partner in the global fight against HIV/AIDS through a special grant program.
*'''Industry:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS/Industry|title=Industry|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; OFID’s funding has benefited all sub-sectors, including building materials, steel, fertilizers and chemicals.
*'''Multisectoral:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS/Multi-Sect-Urban-Dvt|title=Multi Sectoral|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes undertakings that cut across more than one sector and often supports the activities of Social Investment Funds, whose projects are usually demand-driven at a local level and have a strong element of community participation.
*'''Telecommunications:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS/Telecommunications|title=Telecommunications|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of funding to this sector was extended under OFID’s private sector facility, with financing going to mobile network operators in Africa and Asia.
*'''Transportation:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS/Transportation|title=Transportation|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; OFID’s support has been consistently high to this sector and ranges from construction and rehabilitation of roads, seaports and airports, to railways, inland waterways and urban mass transit.
*'''Water and Sanitation:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/FOCUS-AREAS/Water-Supply-Sanitation|title=Water Supply &amp; Sanitation|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; OFID has helped finance a wide range of operations to help provide clean drinking water and safe sanitation systems. These range from large-scale water storage, treatment and distribution projects to village pumps and school latrines, as well as to schemes to optimize water use in arid regions.

==Energy for the Poor Initiative (EPI)==
OFID’s Energy for the Poor initiative (EPI) emerged from the Solemn Declaration of the Third OPEC Summit, which took place in Riyadh in November 2007. The Declaration called for the complete eradication of energy poverty as a global priority and urged OFID to intensify its efforts in support of this goal. The EPI was launched by [[King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz]] of Saudi Arabia in June 2008 and subsequently adopted by OFID as its flagship program.

Since 2008, OFID has worked tirelessly to push energy poverty to the top of the international agenda and was responsible for the universal acceptance of energy poverty eradication as the “missing” Millennium Development Goal.

In June 2012, OFID Member Countries issued a Ministerial Declaration on Energy Poverty&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofid.org/Portals/0/Documents/Ministerial_Declaration_Pamphlet_Final_English_version.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated a revolving minimum sum of US$1bn to finance the EPI. OFID is boosting the volume of its operations in the energy sector accordingly, in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders.

==OFID and the United Nations’ Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SE4ALL)==
OFID has Permanent Observer status at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/member-states/intergovernmental-organizations/ |title=Intergovernmental Organizations |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of its high-profile advocacy efforts, OFID is a key partner in [[Sustainable Energy for All]] (SE4ALL), which has three goals: to achieve universal access to sustainable energy, to double energy efficiency, and to double the share of renewables, all by the year 2030. 
OFID considers its own EPI as complementary to the objectives of SE4ALL. In 2011, OFID’s Director-General [[Suleiman Jasir Al-Herbish]] was invited to join the UN Secretary-General’s High-level Group on SE4ALL, which was charged with developing the Action Agenda that was presented to the 2012 Rio+20 Summit.

===Public sector operations===
Public sector lending&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/PROJECTS-OPERATIONS/Public-Sector|title=Public Sector|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  forms the central pillar of OFID’s operations, accounting for more than two-thirds of total, cumulative commitments. These operations are carried out in direct cooperation with the governments of partner countries in support of their national development strategies.
OFID’s public sector loans are concessional, with low interest rates and long repayment periods. Lending terms are based on several factors, including the per capita gross national income (GNI) of each Partner Country. 
Also included under the public sector is OFID’s contribution to the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) Initiative.

===Private sector operations===
The Private sector facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/PROJECTS-OPERATIONS/Private-Sector|title=Private Sector|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (PSF) was established in 1998 in response to growing demand among partner countries for investment in private enterprise, which is increasingly seen as the engine of economic and social growth. The Facility is a market-oriented financing window that responds to the demand for financing in developing countries in support of their private sector development strategies.
The PSF seeks to promote economic development by encouraging the growth of productive private enterprise in developing countries and supporting the development of local capital markets. Successful interventions stimulate economic growth, generating jobs and income and thereby reduce poverty.

===Trade Finance Facility===
OFID’s Trade Finance Facility (TFF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/PROJECTS-OPERATIONS/Trade-Finance-Facility|title=Trade Finance Facility|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 2006 to broaden the means available to OFID to alleviate poverty and promote economic development. It is a distinct, additional window for supporting eligible developing countries in their efforts to achieve growth and prosperity. The Facility seeks out transactions that are developmentally, environmentally and socially sound, applying credit principles in line with standard practices and setting reasonable market-based return targets.
TFF financing has been used to support the import/export of a diverse range of goods/sectors, including oil, cotton, steel, strategic food products, garments and equipment.

===Grants===


Grants are awarded largely on the basis of the type of project and its expected outcomes; the number of beneficiaries; and the recipient country’s socio-economic situation. The Grants Program includes the following sub-programs:
*'''Technical Assistance:''' Extended to national and regional development projects that aim at fostering sustainable development and reducing poverty. These cover a wide range of development sectors, with women and children given high priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/Grant-Types/Technical-Assistance|title=Technical Assistance|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Research and similar activities:''' Supports activities that increase South-South and North-South cooperation, especially in the field of exchanging know-how and enhancing capacity-building, including human resource development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/Grant-Types/Research|title=Research|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Emergency relief aid:''' To help mitigate the suffering of victims of catastrophes―including those in OFID Member States. Assistance is channeled through specialized relief agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/Grant-Types/Emergency-Aid|title=Emergency Aid|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Special Health Program:''' Since 2002, OFID has been an active partner in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, but this focus has now shifted to incorporate other preventable diseases, including TB, malaria and waterborne illnesses. Also targeted are non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease, which are more prevalent in poor developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/Grant-Types/HIV-AIDS-Special-Program|title=Special Health Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ofid.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Grant Program for Palestine:''' This program supports sustainable development interventions in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as humanitarian relief in times of crisis. It also addresses needs in refugee camps in neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/Grant-Types/Palestine-Special-Program|title=Palestine Special Program|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Energy poverty:''' The Energy portfolio supports OFID’s flagship ‘Energy for the Poor Initiative’, and focuses on the delivery of innovative, medium and small-scale energy poverty solutions, primarily to off-grid, rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/Grant-Types/Energy|title=Energy|publisher=ofid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to other organizations==

===Common Fund for Commodities (CFC)===
The [[Common Fund for Commodities]] (CFC) is an autonomous intergovernmental financial institution established within the framework of the United Nations. Since 1981 OFID has supported the CFC, having made available a total of US$83.6 million in support of the institution. The First Account of US$37.2 million enabled 38 least developed member countries to complete their subscriptions to the CFC First Account Capital. By the end of 2014, OFID had signed agreements with 37 of these countries.

Under the Framework of Financial Support and within the context of the Second Account totalling US$46.4 million, the amount of US$37.9 million has been committed in support of 57 commodity projects in 52 countries; 32 in Africa, 14 in Asia and six in Latin America. Projects eligible for financial support are commodity-focused covering the value chain from production to consumption and benefiting the poor.

===International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)===
OFID played a significant role in the establishment of [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], channeling US$861.1 million in contributions from OPEC member countries towards the agency’s initial capital and first replenishment. Since IFAD's creation, OPEC member states have maintained their firm support of the agency, contributing to additional replenishments of its resources. In addition, OFID itself has given a further US$20 million as a special contribution from its own resources.

===International Monetary Fund (IMF) Trust Fund===
Via OFID, financial resources valued at US$110 million were transferred by a number of OPEC member states to the [[IMF]]-administered Trust Fund which was established in May 1976. Representing profits accruing to seven of these countries from the sale of gold held on their behalf by the IMF, these resources were allocated to provide concessional balance of payments assistance to eligible low-income IMF member countries.

'''Passive obedience''' is a religious and political doctrine, which states that people have a moral duty to obey the law, in particular accepting punishment as part of this obedience.

==George Berkeley==
{{See also|George Berkeley#Moral philosophy}}
The most notable publication describing this doctrine was Bishop [[George Berkeley]]'s ''A Discourse on Passive Obedience'' (1712).&lt;ref&gt;http://berkeleystudies.philosophy.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/imported/storage/original/application/29d48ec3e2853030d73755568998bf61.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The tract is considered Berkeley's major contribution to moral and political philosophy.

In ''A Discourse on Passive Obedience''&lt;ref&gt;https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004899015.0001.000?rgn=main;view=fulltext&lt;/ref&gt;, Berkeley defends the thesis that people have "a moral duty to observe the negative precepts (prohibitions) of the law, including the duty not to resist the execution of punishment."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hayry, Matti. "Passive Obedience and Berkeley's Moral Philosophy." Berkeley Studies 23 (2012): 3-13.   Web&lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://berkeleystudies.philosophy.fsu.edu/content/download/95864/978821/file/BS_023&lt;/nowiki&gt; _Hayry_Article.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, Berkeley does make exceptions to this sweeping moral statement, stating that we need not observe precepts of "usurpers or even madmen"&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley, George. Passive Obedience: Or, the Christian Doctrine of Not Resisting the Supreme Power, Proved and Vindicated ... In a Discourse Deliver'd at the College-chapel. By George Berkeley, M.A. Fellow of Trinity-College, Dublin. London: Printed for H. Clements, 1712. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and that people can obey different supreme authorities if there are more than one claims to the highest authority (§52). On the other hand, Berkeley also insists that disobedience to a tyrant remains wrong, even when the tyrant's violation of moral law is a worse violation than rebellion would be; when such immoral tyranny becomes insufferable, rebellion is predictable, and violates no rights of the tyrant, yet may still violate moral law (§44). In some places, Berkeley's argument for blind obedience to a de facto authority resembles Thomas Hobbes's argument in [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]], on the grounds that rebellion can lead to anarchic violence and chaos which is worse than the worst tyranny (§§16, 47, 51), although Berkeley disagrees with Hobbes's idea that moral and political obligation ultimately rests on the law of self-perservation (§33).

==Other views==

In [[Calvinism]], salvation depends on [[Christ]]'s active obedience, obeying the laws and commands of God the Father, and passive obedience, enduring the punishment of the [[crucifixion]] suffering all the just penalties due to men for their sins.  The two are seen as distinct but inseparable; passive obedience on its own only takes men back to the state of Adam before the Fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1179 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120721004649/http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1179 |archivedate=2012-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apuritansmind.com/Justification/McMahonActivePassiveObedienceJesus.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216143317/http://www.apuritansmind.com/Justification/McMahonActivePassiveObedienceJesus.htm |archivedate=2006-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformed theologian, [[Louis Berkhof]] helpfully wrote: "His active obedience consists in all that He did to observe the law in behalf of sinners, as a condition for obtaining eternal life; and His passive obedience in all that He suffered in paying the penalty of sin and thus discharging the debt of all his people."(Manual of Christian Doctrine 215)

The Scottish theologian [[John Cameron (theologian)|John Cameron]]'s support for passive obedience at the start of the 17th century meant that he was principal of the University of Glasgow for less than a year in 1622.

At a human level a similar contrast distinguished between actively obeying the ''de facto'' power and law even when it conflicted with God's law or laws of nature, and passively obeying (not resisting) when it came to punishment for not actively obeying. 

It was usually associated with the seventeenth-century [[Church of England]] and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and was central to the ideology of the [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] Party and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]. It is most generally seen in reference to Tory opposition to the [[Glorious Revolution]], which saw Parliamentary determination of the succession of the English crown against [[primogeniture]] and the wishes of [[James II of England|James II]]. 

Passive obedience appears twice in [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Miserables]]'', first as a scene heading "The Heroism of Passive Obedience" when the bishop entertains Valjean, and later in the text on the impact of armies when describing French intervention in Spain in 1823.

During his [[coup d'état of 2 December 1851]], the then French president [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] reminded officers and soldiers of their pledge and duty of passive obedience to his orders as chief of the government, since he individually was responsible to the French people and posterity.

[[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]]'s staffer Brian Wild at the behest of House Republican leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130080818 |title=Republican Kevin McCarthy On The Party's 'Pledge' |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pledge to America was publicly released on September 23, 2010, at a hardware store in [[Sterling, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39324896/ns/politics-decision_2010/ |title=GOP 'Pledge' makes closing argument to voters |accessdate=3910-09-23 |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main points==

The pledge criticized the [[Obama administration]], stating that "An arrogant and out-of-touch government of self-appointed elites makes decisions, issues mandates, and enacts laws without accepting or requesting the input of the many". It lists a number of issues, along with the Republican plan to solve them.

In the pledge, Republicans call for:

* Extending the temporary tax cuts passed under President [[George W. Bush]] in [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|2001]] and [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003|2003]] for all taxpayers, including those for those earning over $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples).
* A [[tax deduction]] for small businesses on up to 20 percent of their business income.
* A hold on all unspent funds authorized as part of 2009's [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus bill]] or the 2008 [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP legislation]].
* Roll back government spending to 2008 levels, to save $100 billion while exempting "seniors, veterans, and our troops" from cuts; this would entail cutting 21 percent of the $477 billion budgeted for domestic discretionary spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = O'Connor | first = Patrick  | title = Republican Pledge to Cut $100 Billion May Hit Education, Cancer Research| publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.]]| date = October 1, 2010| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-01/republican-pledge-on-spending-freeze-would-slash-budget-by-100-billion.html| accessdate = 2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A hiring freeze on all federal agencies except those necessary to national security.
* A repeal of the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health-care reform bill]].
* [[Tort reform|Reform of medical liability]] and health insurance practices.
* A permanent ban on any federal funding for [[abortion]].
* A requirement that Congress post all bills online three days before a vote.
* A requirement that lawmakers cite the specific [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] authority that enables the legislation.
* A ban on trials on U.S. soil for detainees currently held at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]].

==Reactions==
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}
The pledge has generally received support from Republicans.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; [[National Review]] called it bolder than the [[Contract with America]] and a "shrewd political document."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/247475/we-ll-take-pledge-editors |title=We'll Take the Pledge |accessdate=2010-09-24 |date=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political strategist and former President [[George W. Bush]] adviser [[Karl Rove]] called it "important" and "practical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703860104575507831916397878 |title=Democrats Run From Pelosi |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2010-09-24 | date=2010-09-23 |first=Karl |last=Rove}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative radio talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] defended the Pledge to America, arguing, "There's nothing crazy about any of this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_092310/content/01125108.guest.html |title=Nothing Crazy in the GOP Pledge |accessdate=2010-09-25 |date=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservative commentators, however, were critical. [[Erick Erickson]], managing editor of [[Redstate]].com called it "perhaps the most ridiculous thing to come out of Washington since [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/us/politics/24repubs.html?_r=1&amp;nl=us |title=Republicans Offer Their Agenda for Midterm Elections |accessdate=2010-09-23 |last= |first= |author=Michael D. Shear and David M. Herszenhorn |date=2010-09-23 |work= |publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican-affiliated columnist [[David Frum]] interpreted the document as "a GOP pledge to do nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.frumforum.com/a-gop-pledge-to-do-nothing |title=A GOP pledge to do nothing |accessdate=2010-09-24 |date=2010-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some social conservatives, such as [[Family Research Council]] president [[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]] and [[Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission|Southern Baptist Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission]] president [[Richard Land]], believed the document could have made a stronger commitment to moral issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2010/septemberweb-only/48-51.0.html |title=What Does the GOP Value? |author=Tobin Grant| accessdate=2010-09-26 |date=2010-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democrats&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; and ''[[The Daily Show]]'''s [[Jon Stewart]]&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-september-23-2010/postcards-from-the-pledge | title=Postcards from the Pledge | accessdate=2010-09-25  |last= |first= |date= 23 Sep 2010 |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized the proposals as recycled ideas from the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] criticized the document for denouncing deficits but calling for tax cuts (which he notes would add $3.7 trillion over the first ten years after its enactment) without specific spending cuts: "In essence, what [the Republicans] say is, 'Deficits are a terrible thing. Let's make them much bigger.'"&lt;ref name="downhill"&gt;{{Citation| last = Krugman| first = Paul| author-link = Paul Krugman | title = Downhill With the G.O.P.| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | pages = A29| date = September 24, 2010| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/opinion/24krugman.html?_r=1| accessdate = 2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators agreed that "the numbers don't remotely add up"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Robinson| first = Eugene| author-link = Eugene Robinson (journalist)| title = The GOP's Hooey to America| newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]| date = September 24, 2010| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/23/AR2010092304742.html| accessdate = 2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Pledge "should be read as a plan to explode debt through the ceiling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Chait| first = Jonathan| author-link = Jonathan Chait| title = The Pledge To America: Deja Vu All Over Again| newspaper = [[The New Republic]]| date = September 23, 2010| url = http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/77894/the-pledge-america-deja-vu-all-over-again| accessdate =2010-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Boykin cited a lack of ethnic diversity in the photographs accompanying the Pledge to America, calling it a pledge "to White America."&lt;ref name="KeithBoykin"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thedailyvoice.com/voice/2010/09/the-gops-pledge-to-white-ameri-1-002650.php| title= The GOP's Pledge to White America | accessdate= 26 Sep 2010  |last= |first= |date= 25 Sep 2010 |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Washington Post]]'' editorial, pollster [[Frank Luntz]], who polled Republican proposals in 1994 before Republicans drafted the Contract with America, found the Pledge to America more partisan-oriented, more anti-government, and lacked a "detailed course of action," but concluded it was a justifiable effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Luntz| first = Frank I.| title = Is the 'Pledge to America' a worthy successor to the 'Contract With America'? | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | date = September 26, 2010| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/24/AR2010092402436.html | accessdate = 2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising and electoral results==
The Republicans' campaign tactics were effective, as Boehner's handpicked [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] chairman [[Pete Sessions]] encouraged incumbents to raise money themselves rather than relying upon the NRCC for funding.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]], one of the founders of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee#Young Guns Program|Young Guns Program]], had also implemented strategies used by former [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] chairman [[Rahm Emanuel]] back in 2006, such as aggressively recruiting Republican candidates to challenge Democrats in districts considered safe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/us/politics/25campaign.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Jeff | last1=Zeleny | first2=Adam | last2=Nagourney | title=Democrats' Long-Held Seats Face G.O.P.

The Republicans made a net gain of 63 seats from Democrats and retook control of the chamber which they lost in the 2006 midterm elections. This number is the highest of any House victory for a single party since [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1948|1948]], and the highest of any midterm election since [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1938|1938]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.nationaljournal.com/gop-projected-to-take-over-house-20101102|title=Boehner Must Navigate Around Senate, Obama -- And Tea Party|publisher=nationaljournal.com|date=11-03-2010|accessdate=2010-11-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104210009/http://nationaljournal.com/gop-projected-to-take-over-house-20101102|archivedate=2010-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationaljournal.com/columns/political-connections/a-heartland-headache-for-dems-20101104|title=Heartland Headache: Democrats have to be more competitive in states that don’t touch an ocean if they want to bounce back.|publisher=nationaljournal.com|date=2010-11-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125102409/http://nationaljournal.com/columns/political-connections/a-heartland-headache-for-dems-20101104|archivedate=2010-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political Research Associates''' ('''PRA''') (formerly Midwest Research, Chicago, 1981–1987), named and known on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] as '''PoliticalResearch.org''', is a non-profit research group located in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]].

==Mission==
PRA studies the [[United States|U.S.]] political [[Right-wing politics|right wing]], as well as [[White supremacy|white supremacists]], and [[paramilitary]] organizations. It has a full-time staff of six. The Executive Director is Tarso Luis Ramos. [[Jean Hardisty|Dr. Jean V. Hardisty]] was the founder and director from 1981 to 2004. [[Chip Berlet]] was the group's senior analyst from 1981&amp;ndash;2011. Other staff members include Eric Ethington (Communications Director), Gabriel Joffe (Program Coordinator), and Kassia Palys (Development Coordinator). Staff researchers include Rev. [[Kapya Kaoma]], Cole Parke, and Mariya Strauss. Fellows include [[Frederick Clarkson]], Rachel Tabachnick, T.F. Charlton, and Spencer Sunshine.

PRA publishes a journal, ''The Public Eye'', quarterly, which reports on specific and current movements or trends within the U.S. political Right, and also produces special reports, past examples of which include "Calculated Compassion: How the Ex-Gay Movement Serves the Right's Attacks on Democracy,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Surina|title=Calculated Compassion|url=http://www.publiceye.org/equality/x-gay/Calculated_Compassion_TOC.html|publisher=Political Research Associates|accessdate=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; authored by former PRA research analyst, Surina Khan," which details attacks on [[gay]]s and [[lesbian]]s, and "Decades of Distortion," which alleged [[scapegoat]]ing of welfare recipients.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.publiceye.org/about.html PRA: About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group provides public speakers, and has staff on hand to answer queries from journalists, researchers, and activists. Its annual funding of approximately $700,000 per year comes from foundation grants, individual contributions, and the sale of research materials.  Expenditures are directed toward staffing, general &amp; administrative expenses, programs and fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publiceye.org/aboutpra/annual_rep_2004.pdf PRA Annual Report 2003-2004] See page 16&lt;/ref&gt; Among its major donors are the [[Public Welfare Foundation]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].

PRA is supported by a number of [[Political progressivism|progressive]] and [[American liberalism|liberal]] activists, including Anne Braden of the [[Southern Organizing Committee]], and Suzanne Pharr of the [[Highlander Research Center]]. Pharr has written that PRA "sets the standard for researchers and political analysts of integrity," and describes the group's research as "thorough, thoughtful, carefully researched, and presented within a broad context of understanding of the complex relationships and activities of the Right." &lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

The '''political history of medieval Karnataka''' spans the 4th to the 16th centuries, when the empires that evolved in the [[Karnataka]] region of [[India]] made a lasting impact on the subcontinent. Before this, alien empires held sway over the region, and the nucleus of power was outside modern Karnataka. The medieval era can be broadly divided into several periods: The earliest native kingdoms and imperialism; the successful domination of the Gangetic plains in northern India and rivalry with the empires of [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilakam]] over the [[Vengi]] region; and the domination of the southern Deccan and consolidation against Muslim invasion. The origins of the rise of the Karnataka region as an independent power date back to the fourth-century birth of the [[Kadamba Dynasty]] of [[Banavasi]], the earliest of the native rulers to conduct administration in the native language of [[Kannada]] in addition to the official [[Sanskrit]]. This is the historical starting point in studying the development of the region as an enduring geopolitical entity and of Kannada as an important regional language.

In the southern regions of Karnataka, the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Western Gangas]] of [[Talakad]] were contemporaries of the Kadambas. The Kadambas and Gangas were followed by the imperial dynasties of the [[Badami Chalukya Empire]], the [[Rashtrakuta Empire]], the [[Western Chalukya Empire]], the [[Hoysala Empire]] and the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], all patronising the ancient Indic religions while showing tolerance to the new cultures arriving from the west of the subcontinent. The Muslim invasion of the Deccan resulted in the breaking away of the feudatory Sultanates in the 14th century. The rule of the [[Bahamani Sultanate]] of [[Bidar]] and the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] from the northern Deccan region caused a mingling of the ancient Hindu traditions with the nascent Islamic culture in the region. The hereditary ruling families and clans ably served the large empires and upheld the local culture and traditions. The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 brought about a slow disintegration of Kannada-speaking regions into minor kingdoms that struggled to maintain autonomy in an age dominated by foreigners until unification and independence in 1947.

==Kadambas and Gangas==

Prior to and during the early centuries of the first millennium, large areas of the Karnataka region was ruled by such imperial powers as the [[Mauryas]] of Maghada and later the [[Satavahanas]], empires whose centres of power were in the Gangetic plains and Central India respectively. With the weakening of the Satavahanas, the Pallavas of Kanchi took control for a brief duration.&lt;ref name="pal"&gt;Ramesh (1984), pp1–3&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the rise to power of the [[Kadamba Dynasty]] of [[Banavasi]] identified the Karnataka region as  an independent political entity and Kannada as an administrative language from the middle of the 5th century.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;From the Halmidi inscription (Ramesh 1984, pp10–11)&lt;/ref&gt; The Kadambas were natives of the [[Talagunda]] region (in modern [[Shivamogga district]]) as proven by inscriptions.&lt;ref name="first1"&gt;The Kadambas were Kanarese speaking dravidians inducted into the Brahmin fold (Moraes 1931, p11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first2"&gt;Their local tribal origins is attested by the Talagunda inscription, R.N. Nandi in Adiga (2006), p93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first3"&gt;Ramesh (1984), p3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naga"&gt;Some inscriptions claim the Kadambas came from a Naga descent (snake worshippers) making them natives of Karnataka region, Moraes (1931), p10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naga1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mayurasharma]], a Brahmin native of Talagunda who was humiliated by a [[Pallava]] guard, rose in rage against the Pallava control of the Banavasi region and declared his independence in 345.&lt;ref name="tala"&gt;From the Talagunda inscription (B.L. Rice in Kamath 2001, pp 30–31)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tala1"&gt;Ramesh (1984), 1984, p6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tala2"&gt;Moraes (1931), p10&lt;/ref&gt; After many wars, the Pallava king had to accept the sovereignty of the Kadambas and Mayurasharma, the founding king, crowned himself at Banavasi (in the present day [[Uttara Kannada]] district).&lt;ref name="cor"&gt;Chopra (2003), p161, part1; Kamath (2001), p30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Western-ganga-empire-map.svg|thumb|right|[[Western Ganga Dynasty|Western Ganga Territories]], 800 CE.]]
The fact that the Kadambas cultivated marital ties with the imperial [[Vakatakas]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] dynasties attests to their power.&lt;ref name="vaka"&gt;Moraes (1931), p26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kakusthavarma]], the most powerful ruler of the dynasty whom inscriptions describe as "ornament of the Kadamba family"  and "Sun among the kings of wide spread flame", gave one daughter in marriage to Vakataka Narendrasena  and another to [[Skandagupta]], grandson of [[Chandragupta II]] of the Gupta dynasty.&lt;ref name="marriage"&gt;From the Talagunda inscription (Moraes 1931, pp26–27)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marriage1"&gt;From the Balaghat inscription of Vakataka Prithvisena (Kamath 2001, p33)&lt;/ref&gt; Historians trace their rise to political power through the examination of the contemporaneous Sanskrit writing, ''Aichitya Vichara Charcha'' by [[Kshemendra]], which quotes portions of a writing ''Kunthalesvara Dautya'' by the famous poet [[Kalidasa]]. Here Kalidasa describes his visit to the Kadamba kingdom as an ambassador where he was not offered a seat in the court of the Kadamba king and had to sit on the ground. Historians view this act as one of assertion by the Kadambas who considered themselves equal to the imperial Gupta dynasty.&lt;ref name="equal"&gt;Moraes, Desai and Panchamukhi in Kamath (2001), p33&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Relief of Jain tirthankara in the Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli.jpg|thumb|left|Roof relief sculpture, Jain Panchakuta basadi at [[Kambadahalli]].]]
Family feuds and conflicts ended the Kadamba rule in the middle of the 6th century when the last Kadamba ruler Krishna Varma II was subdued by [[Pulakeshin I]] of the Chalukya feudatory, ending their sovereign rule. The Kadambas would continue to rule parts of Karnataka and Goa for many centuries to come but never again as an independent kingdom.&lt;ref name="sov"&gt;Chopra (2003), p162, part1; Kamath (2001), p35&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians view the Kadambas as the originators of the Karnataka architectural tradition although there were elements in common with the structures  built by the contemporaneous Pallavas of Kanchi.&lt;ref name="tradition"&gt;Moraes in Kamath (2001), p37&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving Kadamba structure is one dating to the late 5th century in [[Halsi]] in modern [[Belgaum district]]. The most prominent feature of their architectural style, one that remained popular centuries later and was used by the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagar kings, is the ''Kadamba Shikara'' (Kadamba tower) with a ''Kalasa'' (pot) on top.&lt;ref name="kalasa"&gt;Kamath (2001), p38&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Western Ganga Dynasty]], contemporaries of the Kadambas, came to power from [[Kolar]] but in the late 4th century - early 5th century moved their capital to [[Talakad]] in modern [[Mysore district]].&lt;ref name="my"&gt;Chopra (2003), p159, part1; Kamath (2001), p40&lt;/ref&gt; They ruled the region historically known as Gangavadi comprising most of the modern southern districts of Karnataka. Acting as a buffer state between the [[Kannada]] kingdoms of Karnataka region and the Tamil kingdoms of [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilakam]], the Western Ganga architectural innovations show mixed influences.&lt;ref name="mixed"&gt;The impact of the Pallava, early Chalukya and a distinct [[Jain]] influence added to their own innovations are the main features of their architectural idiom (Reddy, Sharma and Rao in Kamath 2001, p50)&lt;/ref&gt; Their sovereign rule ended around the same time as the Kadambas when they came under the Badami Chalukya control. The Western Gangas continued to rule as a feudatory till the beginning of the eleventh century when they were defeated by the [[Cholas]] of [[Tanjavur]].&lt;ref name="tanjore"&gt;Chopra (2003), p160, part1&lt;/ref&gt; Important figures among the Gangas were King [[Durvinita]] and [[Shivamara II]], admired as able warriors and scholars,&lt;ref name="durva"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p2&lt;/ref&gt; and minister [[Chavundaraya]] who was a builder, a warrior and a writer in Kannada and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="chavunda"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="war"&gt;Chopra (2003), pp159&amp;ndash;160, part1; Kamath (2001), p50&lt;/ref&gt; The most important architectural contributions of these Gangas are the monuments and [[basadi]]s of [[Shravanabelagola]], the [[monolith]] of [[Gomateshwara]] termed as the mightiest achievement in the field of sculpture in ancient Karnataka and the ''Panchakuta'' basadi ( five towers) at [[Kambadahalli]].&lt;ref name="contri"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp51–52&lt;/ref&gt; Their free standing pillars (called ''Mahasthambhas'' and ''Brahmasthambhas'') and [[Hero stone]]s (''virgal'') with sculptural detail are also considered a unique contribution.&lt;ref name="maha"&gt;Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Badami Chalukyas==

The [[Chalukya dynasty]], natives of the [[Aihole]] and [[Badami]] region in Karnataka, were at first a feudatory of the Kadambas.&lt;ref name="natives"&gt;N. Laxminarayana Rao and S. C. Nandinath in Kamath 2001, p57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natives1"&gt;Keay (2000), p168&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="natives2"&gt;Jayasimha and Ranaraga, ancestors of Pulakeshin I, were administrative officers in the Badami province under the Kadambas (Fleet in Kanarese Dynasties, p343), (Moraes 1931, p51)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natives3"&gt;Thapar (2003), p328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natives4"&gt;Quote:"They belonged to the Karnataka country and their mother tongue was Kannada" (Sen 1999, p360); Kamath (2001), p58,&lt;/ref&gt; They encouraged the use of Kannada in addition to the Sanskrit language in their administration.&lt;ref name="ex"&gt;Considerable number of their records are in Kannada (Kamath 2001, p67)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natural"&gt;7th century Chalukya inscriptions call Kannada the natural language (Thapar 2003, p345)&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 6th century the Chalukyas came into their own when [[Pulakeshin I]] made the hill fortress in Badami his center of power.&lt;ref name="hillfort"&gt;Sen (1999), p360&lt;/ref&gt; During the rule of [[Pulakeshin II]]  a south Indian empire sent expeditions to the north past the [[Tapti River]] and [[Narmada River]] for the first time and successfully defied Harshavardhana, the King of Northern India (''Uttarapatheswara''). The [[Aihole]] inscription of Pulakeshin II, written in classical Sanskrit language and old Kannada script dated 634,&lt;ref name="mix"&gt;In this composition, the poet deems himself an equal to Sanskrit scholars of lore like Bharavi and Kalidasa (Sastri 1955, p312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mix1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p59&lt;/ref&gt; proclaims his victories against the Kingdoms of Kadambas, Western Gangas, [[Alupas]] of South Canara, Mauryas of [[Puri]], Kingdom of [[Dakshina Kosala|Kosala]], [[Malwa]], [[Lata (region)|Lata]] and Gurjaras of southern [[Rajasthan]]. The inscription describes how King Harsha of [[Kannauj]] lost his ''Harsha'' (joyful disposition) on seeing a large number of his war elephants die in battle against Pulakeshin II.&lt;ref name="aihole"&gt;Keay (2000), p169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gurjara"&gt;Sen (1999), pp361&amp;ndash;362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aihole1"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp59–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fear"&gt;Some of these kingdoms may have submitted out of fear of Harshavardhana of Kannauj (Majumdar in Kamat 2001, p59)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fear1"&gt;The rulers of Kosala were the [[Panduvamshis of Dakshina Kosala|Panduvamshis of South Kosala]] (Sircar in Kamath 2001, pp59)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Relief of seated Vishnu at the Badami cave temple no.3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Badami Cave Temples]] No 3.(Vishnu)]]
These victories earned him the title ''Dakshinapatha Prithviswamy'' (lord of the south). Pulakeshin II continued his conquests in the east where he conquered all kingdoms in his way and reached the [[Bay of Bengal]] in present-day Orissa. A Chalukya viceroyalty was set up in Gujarat and Vengi (coastal Andhra) and princes from the Badami family were dispatched to rule them. Having subdued the Pallavas of Kanchipuram, he accepted tributes from the [[Pandyas]] of [[Madurai]], [[Chola dynasty]] and [[Chera dynasty|Chera]]s of the Kerala region. Pulakeshin II thus became the master of India, south of the Narmada River.&lt;ref name="nar"&gt;Keay (2000), p170&lt;/ref&gt; Pulakeshin II is widely regarded as one of the great kings in Indian history.&lt;ref name="great"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="great1"&gt;Ramesh 1984, p76&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hiuen-Tsiang]], a [[China|Chinese]] traveller visited the court of Pulakeshin II at this time and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] emperor [[Khosrau II]] exchanged ambassadors.&lt;ref name="tabri"&gt;From the notes of Arab traveller Tabari (Kamath 2001, p60)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the continuous wars with [[Pallavas]] took a turn for the worse in 642 when the Pallava king [[Narasimhavarman I]] avenged his father's defeat,&lt;ref name="vincent"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; conquered and plundered the [[Vatapi|capital of Pulakeshin II]] who may have died in battle.&lt;ref name="vincent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="died"&gt;Sen (1999), p362&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, Chalukya [[Vikramaditya II]] marched victoriously into [[Kanchipuram]], the Pallava capital and occupied it on three occasions, the third  time under the leadership of his son and crown prince Kirtivarman II. He thus avenged the earlier humiliation of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a [[Kannada]] inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple.&lt;ref name="kanchi"&gt;Thapar (2003), p331, p345&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kanchi1"&gt;Sastri (1955) p140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kanchi2"&gt;Ramesh (1984), pp159–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kanchi3"&gt;Sen (1999), p364&lt;/ref&gt; He later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the Pandyas, Cholas and Keralas in addition to subduing a [[Kalabhra]] ruler.&lt;ref name="kanchi4"&gt;Ramesh (1984), p159&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kappe Arabhatta]] record from this period (700) in ''tripadi'' (three line)  metre is considered the earliest available record in Kannada poetics. &lt;!--Some contemporary literary writings in Kannada now considered extinct are, ''Karnateshwara Katha'' (a eulogy of Pulakeshin II),&lt;ref name="ex"/&gt; ''Prabhrita'' by Syamakundacharya and ''Chudamani'' by Tumubuluracharya, both of 650 have been referenced in later centuries.&lt;ref name="ex1"&gt;Sastri (1955), p355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ex2"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p4&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The most enduring legacy of the Chalukya dynasty is the architecture and art that they left behind.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;Hardy (1995), p65&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt; More than one hundred and fifty monuments attributed to them, built between 450 and 700, have survived in the [[Malaprabha]] basin in Karnataka.&lt;ref name="temple"&gt;Over 125 temples exist in Aihole alone, {{cite web|title=Monuments of India|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/india.html |author=Michael D. Gunther, 2002|publisher=|work=|accessdate=2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constructions are centred in a relatively small area within the Chalukyan heartland. The structural temples at [[Pattadakal]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], the cave temples of [[Badami]], the temples at [[Mahakuta group of temples|Mahakuta]] and early experiments in temple building at [[Aihole]] are their most celebrated monuments.&lt;ref name="legacy"/&gt; Two of the famous paintings at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] cave no. 1, "The Temptation of the Buddha" and "The Persian Embassy"  are also credited to them.

&lt;ref name="monuments1"&gt;The Badami Chalukya introduced in the western Deccan a glorious chapter alike in heroism in battle and cultural magnificence in peace (K.V.

&lt;!--[[Image:Ellora cave16 001.jpg|thumb|right|Kailasanatha Temple at [[Ellora]]]]--&gt;
In the middle of the 8th century  the Chalukya rule was ended by their feudatory, the Rashtrakuta family rulers of [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]] (in present-day [[Amravati district]] of [[Maharashtra]]). Sensing an opportunity during a weak period in the Chalukya rule, [[Dantidurga]] trounced the great Chalukyan "Karnatabala" (power of Karnata).&lt;ref name="bala"&gt;From the Rashtrakuta inscriptions (Kamath 2001, p57, p64)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bala1"&gt;The Samangadh copper plate grant (753) confirms that feudatory Dantidurga defeated the Chalukyas and humbled their great ''Karnatik'' army (referring to the army of the Badami Chalukyas) (Reu 1933, p54)&lt;/ref&gt; Having overthrown the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas  made [[Manyakheta]] their capital (modern Malkhed in [[Gulbarga district]]).&lt;ref name="manya"&gt;A capital which could put to shame even the capital of gods-From Karda plates (Altekar 1934, p47)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manya1"&gt;A capital city built to excel that of Indra (Sastri, 1955, p4, p132, p146)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the origins of the early Rashtrakuta ruling families in central India and the Deccan in the 6th and 7th centuries is controversial, during the eighth through the tenth centuries they emphasised the importance of the Kannada language in conjunction with Sanskrit in their administration. Rashtrakuta inscriptions are in Kannada and Sanskrit only. They encouraged literature in both languages and thus literature flowered under their rule.&lt;ref name="earlylit1"&gt;Altekar (1934), pp411–413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="early1"&gt;Chopra (2003), p87, part1; Literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flowered during the Rashtrakuta rule (Kamath 2001, p73, pp 88–89)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="early2"&gt;Even royalty of the empire took part in poetic and literary activities (Thapar 2003, p334)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eralylit2"&gt;[[Bisheshwar Nath Reu|Reu]] (1933), pp37–38&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Kailasha temple at ellora.JPG|thumb|left|[[Ellora Kailasanathar Temple|Kailash Temple]] in [[Ellora Caves]]]]

The Rashtrakutas quickly became the most powerful Deccan empire, making their initial successful forays into the [[doab]] region of [[Ganges River]] and [[Yamuna|Jamuna River]] during the rule of [[Dhruva Dharavarsha]].&lt;ref name="dig"&gt;Chopra (2003), p89, part1; His victories were a "digvijaya"  gaining only fame and booty in that region (Altekar in Kamath 2001, p75)&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of his son [[Govinda III]] signaled a new era with Rashtrakuta victories against the [[Pala Dynasty]] of [[Bengal]] and Gurjara [[Pratihara]] of north western India resulting in the capture of [[Kannauj]]. The Rashtrakutas held Kannauj intermittently during a period of  a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich [[Gangetic plains]].&lt;ref name="triparty"&gt;Chopra (2003), p90, part1&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Govinda III's victories, historians have compared him to [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Pandava]] [[Arjuna]] of the Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]].&lt;ref name="pandava"&gt;Keay (2000), p199)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank the icy water of the Himalayan stream and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges River.&lt;ref name="ganga"&gt;Kamath 2001, p76&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amoghavarsha I]], eulogised by contemporary Arab traveller Sulaiman as one among the four great emperors of the world, succeeded Govinda III to the throne and ruled during an important cultural period that produced landmark writings in Kannada and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="loving"/&gt;&lt;ref name="landmark"&gt;[[Kavirajamarga]] in Kannada and ''Prashnottara Ratnamalika'' in Sanskrit (Reu 1933, p38)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landmark1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p90&lt;/ref&gt; The benevolent development of Jain religion was a hallmark of his rule. Because of his religious temperament, his interest in the arts and literature and his peace-loving nature,&lt;ref name="loving"&gt;Chopra (2003), p91, part1&lt;/ref&gt; he has been compared to emperor [[Ashoka]].&lt;ref name="Ashoka"&gt;Panchamukhi in Kamath (2001), p80&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of [[Indra III]] in the tenth century enhanced the Rashtrakuta position as an imperial power as they conquered and held Kannauj again.&lt;ref name="master"&gt;Chopra (2003), p92, part1; Altekar in Kamath 2001, p81&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krishna III]] followed Indra III to the throne in 939. A patron of Kannada literature and a powerful warrior, his reign marked the submission of the [[Paramara]] of [[Ujjain]] in the north and Cholas in the south.&lt;ref name="paramar"&gt;Chopra (2003), p92&amp;ndash;93, part1&lt;/ref&gt;

An Arabic writing ''Silsilatuttavarikh'' (851) called the Rashtrakutas one among the four principle empires of the world.&lt;ref name="siraf"&gt;Reu (1933), p39&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kitab-ul-Masalik-ul-Mumalik'' (912) called them the "greatest kings of India" and there were many other contemporaneous books written in their praise.&lt;ref name="hara"&gt;''Murujul Zahab'' by Al Masudi (944), ''Kitabul Akalim'' by Al Istakhri (951), ''Ashkal-ul-Bilad'' by Ibn Haukal (976) (Reu 1933, p41–42)&lt;/ref&gt; The Rashtrakuta empire at its peak spread from [[Cape Comorin]] in the south to Kannauj in the north and from [[Banaras]] in the east to Broach (Bharuch) in the west.&lt;ref name="Himalayas"&gt;From the Sanjan inscriptions, {{cite web|title=The Rashrakutas|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/rashtrakutas/|author=Dr. Jyotsna Kamat|publisher=1996–2006 Kamat's Potpourri|work=|accessdate=2006-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 10th century, the [[Western Chalukya Empire|Western Chalukyas]], also known as the Kalyani Chalukyas or 'Later' Chalukyas rose to power by overthrowing the Rashtrakutas under whom they had been serving as feudatories.  [[Manyakheta]] was their capital early on before they moved it to Kalyani (modern [[Basavakalyan]]). Whether the kings of this empire belonged to the same family line as their namesakes, the [[Badami Chalukyas]] is still debated.&lt;ref name="bilhana1"&gt;Chopra (2003), p137, part1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bilhana"&gt;Fleet, Bhandarkar and Altekar and Gopal B.R in (Kamath 2001, p100)&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the Western Chalukya origins, Kannada remained their language of administration and the Kannada and Sanskrit literature of their time was prolific.&lt;ref name="patron"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p68, p17–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="form"&gt;Sen (1999), p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="administrator1"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp356&amp;ndash;358; Kamath (2001), p114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="administrator"&gt;More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to the Chalukya King [[Vikramaditya VI]] than to any other king prior to the 12th century, {{cite web|title=Chalukyas of Kalyana |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/deckings.htm|author=Kamat, Jyotsna|publisher=1996–2006 Kamat's Potpourri|work=|accessdate=2006-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tailapa II]], a feudatory ruler from Tardavadi (modern [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur district]]), re-established the Chalukya rule by defeating the Rashtrakutas during the reign of [[Karka II]]. He timed his rebellion to coincide with the confusion caused by the invading [[Paramara]] of Central India to the Rashtrakutas capital in 973.&lt;ref name="central2"&gt;From the 957 and 965 records (Kamath 2001, p101)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="central"&gt;Sastri 1955, p162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="central1"&gt;Tailapa II was helped in this campaign by the Kadambas of [[Hanagal]] (Moraes 1931, pp 93–94)&lt;/ref&gt; This era produced prolonged warfare with the Chola dynasty of [[Tamilakam]] for control of the resources of the [[Godavari River]]-[[Krishna River]] doab region in [[Vengi]]. [[Someshvara I]], a brave Chalukyan king, successfully curtailed the growth of the Chola Empire to the south of the [[Tungabhadra River]] region despite suffering some defeats&lt;ref name="curtail"&gt;Ganguli in Kamath 2001, p103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curtail1"&gt;Sastri (1955), p167–168&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining control over his feudatories in the Konkan, Gujarat, Malwa and [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] regions.&lt;ref name="curtail2"&gt;Kamath (2001), p104&lt;/ref&gt; For approximately 100 years, beginning in the early 11th century, the Cholas occupied large areas of South Karnataka region (Gangavadi).&lt;ref name="gangavadi"&gt;Sastri (1955), p164, p174; The Cholas occupied Gangavadi from 1004 to 1114 (Kamath 2001, p118)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Ornate pillars in the Saraswati temple at Gadag.jpg|thumb|left|Gadag style pillars, [[Western Chalukya Architecture|Western Chalukya art]].]]
In 1076, the ascent of the most famous king of this Chalukya family, [[Vikramaditya VI]], changed the balance of power in favour of the Chalukyas.&lt;ref name="balance"&gt;Chopra (2003), p139, part1&lt;/ref&gt; His fifty-year reign was an important period in Karnataka's history and is referred to as the "Chalukya Vikrama era".&lt;ref name="vikram"&gt;Thapar, 2003, pp 468–469&lt;/ref&gt; His victories over the Cholas in the late 11th and early 12th centuries put an end to the Chola influence in the Vengi region permanently.&lt;ref name="balance"/&gt; Some of the well-known contemporaneous feudatory families of the Deccan under Chalukya control were the Hoysalas, the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]], the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] and the Southern Kalachuri.&lt;ref name="balance" /&gt; At their peak, the Western Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the [[Narmada River]] in the north to the [[Kaveri River]] in the south. Vikramaditya VI is considered  one of the most influential kings of Indian history.&lt;ref name="none"&gt;Poet [[Bilhana]] in his Sanskrit work wrote "Rama Rajya" regarding his rule, poet Vijnaneshwara called him  "A king like none other" (Kamath 2001, p106)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apponent"&gt;Sastri (1955), p6&lt;/ref&gt; Important architectural works were created by these Chalukyas, especially in the Tungabhadra river valley, that served as a conceptual link between the building idioms of the early Badami Chalukyas and the later Hoysalas.&lt;ref name="link"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp 427&amp;ndash;428; Quote:"Their creations have the pride of place in Indian art tradition" (Kamath 2001, p115)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="link1"&gt;Quote:"Of the city of Kalyana, situated in the north of Karnataka nothing is left, but a fabulous revival in temple building during the 11th century in central Karnataka testifies to the wealth during Kalyan Chalukya rule"(Foekema (1996), p14)&lt;/ref&gt; With the weakening of the Chalukyas in the decades following the death of Vikramaditya VI in 1126, the feudatories of the Chalukyas gained their independence.

The [[Kalachuris of Karnataka]], whose ancestors were immigrants into the southern deccan from central India, had ruled as a feudatory from Mangalavada (modern Mangalavedhe in Maharashtra).&lt;ref name="manda"&gt;Kamath (2001), p107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bijjala II]], the most powerful ruler of this dynasty, was a commander (''mahamandaleswar'') during the reign of Chalukya Vikramaditya VI.&lt;ref name="karhad"&gt;From the 1142 and 1147 records, Kamath (2001), p108&lt;/ref&gt; Seizing an opportune moment in the waning power of the Chalukyas, Bijjala II declared independence in 1157 and annexed their capital [[Basavakalyana|Kalyani]].&lt;ref name="chikka"&gt;Chopra (2003), p139, part1; From the Chikkalagi records (Kamath 2001, p108)&lt;/ref&gt; His rule was cut short by his assassination in 1167 and  the ensuing civil war caused by his sons fighting over the throne ended the dynasty as the last Chalukya scion regained control of Kalyani. This victory however, was short-lived as the Chalukyas were eventually driven out by the Seuna Yadavas.&lt;ref name="regain"&gt;Chopra (2003), p140, part1; Kamath (2001) p109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoysalas==

&lt;!--[[Image:Belur Chennakeshava temple.JPG|thumb|right|ChennakeshavaTemple at [[Belur]]]]--&gt;
[[Image:Hoysala Empire extent.svg|thumb|right|[[Hoysala Empire]] in 1200 CE.]]

The Hoysalas had become a powerful force even during their rule from [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] in the 11th century as a feudatory of the Chalukyas (in the south Karnataka region).&lt;ref name="gratiate"&gt;Sen (1999), p498&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 12th century they successfully fought the Cholas in the south, convincingly defeating them in the battle of [[Talakad]] and moved their capital to nearby [[Halebidu]].&lt;ref name="provincial"&gt;Sen (1999), p499&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="talkad"&gt;Vishnuvardhana made many military conquests later to be further expanded by his successors into one of the most powerful empires of South India—William Coelho. He was the true maker of the Hoysala kingdom—B.S.K. Iyengar in Kamath (2001), p124–126&lt;/ref&gt; Historians refer to the founders of the dynasty as natives of [[Malnad]] Karnataka, based on the numerous inscriptions calling them ''Maleparolganda'' or "Lord of the Male (hills) chiefs" (''Malepas'').&lt;ref name="gratiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="malnad"&gt;B.L.Rice in Kamath (2001), p123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="malnad1"&gt;Keay (2000), p251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="malnad2"&gt;Thapar (2003), p367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="malnad3"&gt;Kamath (2001), p123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="malnad4"&gt;Natives of south Karnataka (Chopra, 2003, p150 Part1)&lt;/ref&gt; With the waning of the Western Chalukya power, the Hoysalas declared their independence in the late twelfth century.
[[Image:Shilabaalika on pillar bracket in Chennakeshava Temple at Belur3.jpg|thumb|left| Shilabalika, Chennakeshava Temple, [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]].]]
During this period of Hoysala control, distinctive Kannada literary metres such as ''Ragale'' (blank verse), ''Sangatya'' (meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), ''Shatpadi'' (seven line) etc. became widely accepted.&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ragala10"&gt;Shiva Prakash in Ayyappapanicker (1997), pp164, 203; Rice E. P. (1921), p59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sang1"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp132–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sang"&gt;Sastri (1955), p359, p361&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoysalas expanded the [[Vesara]] architecture stemming from the Chalukyas,&lt;ref name="cul"&gt;Sastri (1955), p427&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the Hoysala architectural articulation and style as exemplified in the construction of the [[Chennakesava Temple|Chennakeshava Temple]] at Belur and the [[Hoysaleswara temple|Hoysaleshwara Temple]] at Halebidu.&lt;ref name="arch-tradition"&gt;Sen (1999), pp500–501&lt;/ref&gt; Both these temples were built in commemoration of the victories of the Hoysala [[Vishnuvardhana]] against the Cholas in 1116.&lt;ref name="chenna"&gt;Foekema (1996), p14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chenna1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p124&lt;/ref&gt; [[Veera Ballala II]], the most effective of the Hoysala rulers, defeated the aggressive Pandya when they invaded the Chola kingdom and assumed the titles "Establisher of the Chola Kingdom"
(''Cholarajyapratishtacharya''), "Emperor of the south" (''Dakshina Chakravarthi'') and "Hoysala emperor" (''Hoysala Chakravarthi'').&lt;ref name="oustand"&gt;The most outstanding of the Hoysala kings according to Barrett and William Coelho in Kamath (2001), p126&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoysalas extended their foothold in areas known today as Tamil Nadu around 1225, making the city of Kannanur Kuppam near [[Srirangam]] a provincial capital.&lt;ref name="provincial" /&gt; This gave them control over South Indian politics that began a period of Hoysala hegemony in the southern Deccan.&lt;ref name="kuppam"&gt;B.S.K. Iyengar in Kamath (2001), p126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuppam1"&gt;Keay (2000), p252&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 13th century, with the Hoysala power remaining unchallenged, the first of the [[Muslim]] incursions into [[South India]] began. After over two decades of waging war against a foreign power, the Hoysala ruler at the time, [[Veera Ballala III]], died in the battle of [[Madurai]] in 1343.&lt;ref name="mad"&gt;Sen (1999), p500&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the merger of the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire with the areas administered by [[Harihara I]], founder of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], located in the [[Tungabhadra]] region in present-day Karnataka. The new kingdom thrived for another two centuries with [[Vijayanagara]] as its capital.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;Two theories exist about the origin of Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I. One states that they were [[Kannadiga]] commanders of the Hoysala army and another that they were [[Telugu language|Telugu]] speakers and commanders of the earlier [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya Kingdom]] (Kamath 2001, pp 159–160)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vijayanagara Empire==
{{See also|Vijayanagara Empire|Kannada literature in Vijayanagara empire|Vijayanagara Architecture}}

&lt;!--[[Image:Balakrishna temple DK.jpg|thumb|right|Balakrishna Temple at [[Hampi]]]]--&gt;

The Vijayanagara Empire quickly rose to imperial status as early as the late 14th century. During the reign of [[Bukka Raya I]], the island of [[Sri Lanka|Lanka]] paid tributes and ambassadors were exchanged with the [[Ming Dynasty]] of China.&lt;ref name="ming"&gt;Sastri (1955), p241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ming2"&gt;Chopra (2003), p28, part2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ming3"&gt;Indicated by records of the Ming dynasty (Kamath 2001, p162)&lt;/ref&gt; The  empire's most famous rulers were [[Deva Raya II]] and the  [[Tuluva]] king [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Deva Raya II (known as ''Gajabetekara'' or hunter of elephants) ascended the throne in 1424 and was the most  effective of the [[Sangama Dynasty|Sangama dynasty]] rulers.&lt;ref name="deva"&gt;Sastri (1955), p244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deva10"&gt;Chopra (2003), p32, part2&lt;/ref&gt; He quelled rebelling feudal lords, the Zamorin of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the [[Kollam|Quilon]] in the south, and invaded the island of [[Sri Lanka|Lanka]] while becoming overlord of the kings of [[Burma]] at Pegu and Tanasserim.&lt;ref name="deva1"&gt;Chopra (2003), p32, part2; From the notes of Persian Abdur Razzak. Writings of Nuniz confirms that the kings of Burma paid tributes to Vijayanagara empire (Sastri 1955, p245)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deva2"&gt;Kamath (2001), p164&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief decline, the empire reached its peak in the early 16th century during the rule of [[Krishnadevaraya]] when the Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south.&lt;ref name="deva6"&gt;Chopra (2003), pp37&amp;ndash;39, part2; The notes of Portuguese Barbosa during the time of Krishnadevaraya confirms a very rich and well provided Vijayanagara city (Kamath 2001, p186)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Stone Chariot at the Vitthala Temple in Hampi.jpg|thumb|left|Stone Chariot [[Hampi]]]]
Many important monuments at [[Hampi]] were either completed or commissioned during the reign of Krishnadevaraya. The enduring legacy of this empire is the vast open-air theatre of monuments at the regal capital, [[Vijayanagara]], which is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. [[Vijayanagara Architecture|Vijayanagara architecture]] is a vibrant blend of the preceding Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandya and Chola styles.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;Chopra (2003), p177, part2; Art critic, [[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] calls Vijayanagar architecture a blossoming of Dravidian style&amp;ndash;Kamath (2001), p182&lt;/ref&gt; Literature in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Sanskrit languages found royal patronage.

A diminished Vijayanagara Empire moved its capital to Penukonda in modern Andhra Pradesh and later to [[Chandragiri]] and [[Vellore]] before disintegrating. In the south and coastal Karnataka region, the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and  the [[Keladi Nayaka]] of Shimoga held sway while the northern regions  were under the control of the Bijapur Sultanate.&lt;ref name="break"&gt;Kamath (2001), p174&lt;/ref&gt; The Nayaka kingdom lasted into the 18th century before merging with the Kingdom of Mysore which remained a princely state until Indian independence in 1947, though they came under the British Raj (rule) in 1799 following the defeat and death of the last independent Mysore king, Tipu Sultan.

==Bahmani Sultanate==
{{Main article|Bahmani Sultanate}}
[[Image:Bahamani-sultanate-map.svg|thumb|right|[[Bahmani Sultanate]] territories, 1470.]]

The [[Bahmani Sultanate]], a contemporary of the Vijayanagara Empire, was founded in 1347 by Alla-ud-din-Hasan, a breakaway commander of the armies of the northern invaders led by [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Mohammed-bin-Tughlaq]]. The capital was [[Gulbarga]] but was later moved further north to [[Bidar]] in 1430.&lt;ref name="bin"&gt;Chopra (2003), p53, part2; Kamath (2001), p190&lt;/ref&gt; The first of the Muslim invasions of the Deccan came in the early decades of the 14th century. At its peak, the Bahamani kingdom extended from the [[Krishna River]] in the south to [[Penganga River]] in the north, thus covering the regions of northern parts of modern Karnataka, parts of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The most famous of the Bahamani Kings was Firuz Shah (also known as Taj Ud Din Firuz), who ruled from 1397 to 1422.&lt;ref name="firuz"&gt;Chopra (2003), pp56&amp;ndash;57, part2; Kamath (2001), p191&lt;/ref&gt; Militarily, the rule of Firuz Shah had uneven success  against the Vijayanagara kings while he was more convincingly successful against the Kherla rulers of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and the Vema Reddies of [[Rajamundry]], areas that he annexed in 1417. His last encounter with the Vijayanagara armies in 1417 was disastrous and led to his defeat, ill health and ultimate death in 1422.&lt;ref name="firuz"/&gt;

Contemporary writers such as Tabataba, in his writings have heaped praise on Firuz Shah. Tabataba wrote of the king as, "[a]n impetuous, mighty monarch who patronised learned men, Sheiks and hermits", while Shirazi described him as "a just, pious and generous king and one without equal". He has earned the honorific ''Sultan-i-ghazian'' for his bravery, tolerant nature and patronage of the fine arts.&lt;ref name="shirazi"&gt;Chopra (2003), p57, part2; Kamath (2001), p192&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of one historian, Firuz Shah was one of the most notable Sultans to rule in India.&lt;ref name="shah"&gt;Sinha in Kamath (2001), p192&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known figure from this kingdom was Kwaja Mahamud Gavan, the prime minister, who served under several kings and regents. He rose above the kings and princess of the dynasty by virtue of his ministerial, administrative, martial, literary and philanthropic abilities. A Persian by descent and a visitor to Bidar in 1445, he impressed the ruling Sultan Alla-ud-din II and was chosen to become a minister in his court. As a commander he was able to extend the kingdom from [[Hubli]] in the south to Goa in the west and Kondavidu and Rajamahendri in the east. He soon rose to the position of prime minister (''Vakil-Us-Sultanat'').&lt;ref name="gavan"&gt;Chopra (2003), p63, part2; Kamath (2001), p195&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahamanis introduced the large-scale use of paper in administration and began the Indo-Sarasenic architectural style, designed and constructed by Persian architects and artisans, (also known as ''Deccani'' architecture) with its local influences in Karnataka.&lt;ref name="gavan1"&gt;Chopra (2003), pp181&amp;ndash;182, part2; Kamath (2001), p198&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultanate monuments of Bidar and Gulbarga are testimony to their interest in architecture. The Bande Nawaz tombs and a Jama Masjid in Gulbarga which exhibits a Spanish influence are well known. In Bidar, their buildings have Persian, Turkish, Arabic and Roman influences (the Solah Khamba mosque being an example).&lt;ref name="Turk"&gt;Kamath (2001), p198&lt;/ref&gt; Rangin Mahal, Gangan Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Chini Mahal, Nagina Mahal and the Taqk Mahal are some of the palaces built by them that have retained their beauty. The Ahmad Shah Wali tombs are noted for their decor, and the school of learning (''madrasa'') built by Gavan in Bidar (1472), with its lecture halls, library, mosque and residential houses are also famous.&lt;ref name="tomb"&gt;Chopra (2003), p182, part2; Kamath (2001), p199&lt;/ref&gt; In the later part of the 15th century, with a growing rift between the local Deccani Muslims and the ''Pardeshi'' Muslims (foreign) who occupied influential positions in the kingdom, the execution of Gavan under dubious circumstances in 1481, and constant wars with the Vijayanagara kings weakened the Bahamani Kingdom eventually bringing about its end in 1527.&lt;ref name="end"&gt;Chopra (2003), p62, pp64&amp;ndash;65, part2; Kamath (2001), p194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bijapur Sultanate==
{{Main article|Bijapur Sultanate}}
[[Image:Bijapur-sultanate-map.svg|thumb|right|[[Bijapur Sultanate]] territories under Ibrahim II, 1620 CE.]]

The [[Bijapur Sultanate]] (or Adilshahi Kingdom) emerged towards the end of the 15th century with the weakening of the Bahmani Sultanate . The main sources of information about this kingdom comes from  contemporaneous inscriptions and writings in Persian and Kannada, travelogues of European visitors to the Deccan and inscriptions of neighbouring kingdoms.&lt;ref name="bija"&gt;Kamath (2001), p200&lt;/ref&gt; In 1489, Yusuf Adilkhan, a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] general in the Bahmani army, broke away to found the kingdom from modern Bijapur . Throughout his rule, the Sultanate was at war with the Vijayanagara Empire over the strategic [[Raichur]] doab, with the Portuguese over [[Goa]], with the Barid Shahis of Bidar and later with the erstwhile feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire who had gained independence after 1565. The [[Italy|Italian]] writer Varathema wrote about the founder Adilkhan and Bijapur, "A powerful and prosperous king", "the city was encircled by many fortifications and contained beautiful and majestic buildings".&lt;ref name="bija"/&gt;

Inter-Sultanate marriages normalised relations and Ali I (1557–1580) joined a confederacy of Sultanates who eventually inflicted a crushing defeat on the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565.&lt;ref name="conf"&gt;Kamath (2001), p201&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable ruler of the dynasty was Ibrahim II (1580–1626) who ascended the throne as a nine-year-old with Chandbibi, the king's aunt acting as the regent. Later when Ibrahim II was defeated by the first of the Moghul incursions into the Deccan, he gave his daughter in marriage to Daniyal, a son of Emperor [[Akbar]], but managed to collect tributes from the former feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire.&lt;ref name="erst"&gt;Kamath (2001), p202&lt;/ref&gt; According to a historian, the rule of Ibrahim II was the high point of the Bijapur Sultanate.&lt;ref name="high"&gt;Sinha in Kamath (2001), p2002&lt;/ref&gt; A tolerant king inclined to the fine arts, the earliest book on music in Urdu language called ''Kitab-e-Nauras'' is ascribed to him. The opening song in the book is an invocation of the Hindu Goddess [[Saraswati]].&lt;ref name="erst"/&gt; During the rule of his son Muhammad, Shahji Bhosle from [[Ahmadnagar]] joined the Bijapur army and along with commander Ranadullah Khan conducted many successful campaigns in the southern Deccan collecting tribute from local rulers there. The final end of the diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from [[Vellore]] came during these campaigns.&lt;ref name="camp"&gt;Kamath (2001), p203&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:GolGumbaz2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gol Gumbaz]] at [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]], has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine [[Hagia Sophia]].]]
However, the rise of [[Maratha empire|Maratha]] [[Shivaji]] and constant invasions by the [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughals]] from the north took its toll on the kingdom, eventually bringing it to an end in the later part of the 17th century. The contributions of the Bijapur Sultanate in the Indo-Saracenic idiom to the architectural landscape of Karnataka  is noteworthy. Their most famous monuments are the mausoleums called Ibrahim Rauza and the [[Gol Gumbaz]] apart from many other palaces and mosques.&lt;ref name="gol"&gt;Kamath (2001), p207&lt;/ref&gt; The elegance, finish and beauty of Mehtar Mahal is claimed by a historian to be equal to anything in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name="cairo"&gt;Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p207&lt;/ref&gt; Their Kali Masjid at [[Lakshmeshwar]] is a synthesis of Hindu and Muslim styles. The Ibrahim Rauza built by Ibrahim II is a combination of a mausoleum and a mosque and is called the "[[Taj Mahal]] of the Deccan".&lt;ref name="taj"&gt;Fergusson in Kamath (2001), p208&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gol Gumbaz]] built by Muhammad  is the largest dome in India and the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine [[Hagia Sophia]] with an impressive "whispering gallery". Some historians consider this one of the architectural marvels of the world.&lt;ref name="gumbuz"&gt;Kamath (2001), p209&lt;/ref&gt; Persian language was given state patronage while the use of the local languages, Kannada and Marathi was popularised in local affairs.&lt;ref name="localaffairs"&gt;Kamath (2001), p206&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 at the [[Battle of Talikota]] started a slow disintegration of the Kannada speaking region into many short-lived ''palegar'' chiefdoms, and the better known [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and the kingdom of [[Keladi Nayaka]]s, which were to later become important centres of Kannada literary production.&lt;ref name="tali"&gt;Nagaraj in Pollock (2003), p370; Kamath (2001), p171, p174&lt;/ref&gt; These kingdoms and the Nayakas ("chiefs") of Tamil country continued to owe nominal support to a diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from [[Penukonda]] (1570) and later from [[Chandragiri]] (1586) in modern [[Andhra Pradesh]], followed by a brief period of independence.&lt;ref name="nominal"&gt;Subrahmanyam (2001), pp67&amp;ndash;68; Kamath (2001), pp173&amp;ndash;174&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-17th century, large areas in north Karnataka came under the control of the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] who waged several wars in a bid to establish a hegemony over the southern Deccan.&lt;ref name="vel"&gt;Chopra (2003), p96, part2; Kamath (2006), pp173&amp;ndash;174&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat of the Bijapur Sultanate at the hands of the [[Mughals]] in late 17th century added a new dimension to the prevailing confusion.&lt;ref name="dim"&gt;Chopra (2003), pp101; Kamath (2006), p204&lt;/ref&gt; The constant wars of the local kingdoms with the two new rivals, the Mughals and the [[Marathas]], and among themselves, caused further instability in the region.&lt;ref name="lek"&gt;Kamath (2001), p226&lt;/ref&gt; Major areas of Karnataka came under the rule of the Mughals and the Marathas. Under [[Hyder Ali]] and his son [[Tipu Sultan]], the Mysore Kingdom reached its zenith of power but had to face the growing English might who by now had a firm foothold in the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="tip"&gt;Chopra (2003), p71, part3; Kamath (2001), p231–234&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799 in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war, the Mysore Kingdom came under the British umbrella.&lt;ref name="fell"&gt;Chopra (2003), pp80&amp;ndash;81, part3&lt;/ref&gt; More than a century later, with the dawn of India as an independent nation in 1947, the [[Unification of Karnataka|unification of Kannada speaking regions]] as modern Karnataka state brought four centuries of political uncertainty (and centuries of foreign rule) to an end.

{{History of Botswana}}
The '''Raid on Gaborone''' (called '''Operation Plecksy''' by the [[South African Defence Force]]) occurred on 14 June 1985 when South African Defence Force troops, under the order of General [[Constand Viljoen]], crossed into Botswana and attacked the offices of [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), the military wing of the [[African National Congress]], in [[Gaborone]]. The raid, the fifth South African attack on a neighbouring country since 1981, killed 12 people including women and children; only five of the victims were members of the African National Congress.

In the 1980s, [[Botswana–South Africa relations|relations]] between [[Botswana]] and [[South Africa]] were strained.  [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|Anti-apartheid]] groups like the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) used Botswana and other countries in [[Southern Africa]] as refuge.{{efn|"From Botswana the ANC had been responsible since August 1984 alone for 36 acts of violence. During this period six people were murdered and extensive damage was caused to property."{{sfn|Allport}}}} The ANC set up bases in Gaborone that issued crash courses for guerilla attacks; under the guise of weekend tourists, new recruits would receive training on grenade handling and a list of targets to attack.{{sfn|Allport}} Despite Botswana's non-alignment policy,{{efn|"...it remained Botswana's policy to accommodate South African refugees, while not allowing them to use the country as a base for attacks on South Africa."{{sfn|Europa Publications|2003|pp=92–93}}}} the [[South African Defence Force]] conducted several [[South Africa under apartheid#Cross-border raids|cross-border raids]] to stop the groups.

In 1981, the [[Botswana Defence Force]] (BDF) purchased Soviet weaponry. President [[Quett Masire]] justified the deal as a way to allow BDF to better prevent groups like the ANC from crossing into South Africa.{{sfn|Europa Publications|2003|p=92}} Shots were fired across the Botswana-South African border in April 1982. Grenade attacks earlier in the week outside [[Cape Town]] that killed two South Africa members of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] and news of an expected attack on [[Pretoria]] in July 1985 pushed General [[Constand Viljoen]] to launch the attack.{{sfn|Parks|1985}}

The following locations were identified as MK safe houses in Gaborone by the SADF:{{sfn|Joint Publications Research Service|1985}}
*Plot C, [[Tlokweng]]: Safe house used for ANC training of the Transvaal and Western Cape suicide squads
*Plot A, Tlokweng: Occupied by "George" who accommodated terrorists
*7819 Broadhurst: Occupied by Duke Machobane, provided accommodation for [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]
*13212 Broadhurst: Occupied by Nkukwane Motsweni, alias Mkhulu, responsible for the transportation of trained terrorists from Zambia to safe houses in Botswana
*2914 Pudulugo Close: Occupied by Mike Hamlyn, responsible for accommodating terrorists and for transporting ANC recruits attached to the "Transvaal Suicide Squad"
*Cycle Mart Building: housing the offices of the intelligence gathering apparatus of the ANC in Botswana and who also distributed a propaganda pamphlet in "newsletter" form aimed against South Africa
*15717 Broadhurst: Occupied by George Pwale, controller of ANC financial affairs and responsible for the bomb blast at the Carlton, Johannesburg, in December 1976.

==The attack==
Around 1:30 am on 14 June, South African soldiers crossed the border into Botswana.{{sfn|Parks|1985}} To lead the attack, the SADF employed former operatives of the [[Selous Scouts]], a special regiment of the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]].{{sfn|Independent Online|2000}} General Viljoen stated that the soldiers used megaphones to urge the residents of Gaborone to hide in their houses while the raid occurred.{{sfn|Allport}} According to Manuel Olifant, a policeman involved in the raid, the SADF readied around 50 tanks, helicopters, and jet fighters in [[Zeerust]] for use if Botswana retaliated, but they were not needed.{{sfn|Independent Online|2000}}

===Casualties===
Twelve people were killed in the attack. A partial list follows:
*a six-year-old [[Sotho people|Mosotho]] boy
*Ahmed Mohammed Geer, a Somali-born Dutch citizen{{sfn|Allport}}{{efn|Geer was found to have relations with the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].{{sfn|Allport}}}}
*two Batswana women
*Mike Hamlyn, a South African student who was studying in Botswana
*[[Thamsanga Mnyele]], a South African graphic artist and guerilla {{sfn|Freedom Park|2003|p=2}}
*Dick Mtsweni, a 71-year-old man employed by the ANC as a driver.{{sfn|Dick Mtsweni|2008}}

==Aftermath==
Witnesses say that civilians were killed despite what SADF reports said at the time. Muff Andersson, a former member of MK, said that instead of attacking legitimate targets, the SADF instead arbitrarily picked ANC sympathisers to "teach the ANC a lesson".{{sfn|News24.com|2000}} She asserts that the SADF "did not care who was killed."{{sfn|News24.com|2000}}

===Reactions===
*{{ru|South Africa|1928}}: At first, the attack was shown in a positive light by the South African press.{{sfn|Carlin|2009}} A memorial, [[Freedom Park (South Africa)|Freedom Park]], was built in Pretoria to honour those who died in this attack and others during the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] years.{{sfn|Freedom Park|2003|p=1}}
*{{flagu|United Kingdom}}: In 1985, the representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations said that South Africa "in no way justified the violation of sovereignty and the killing or wounding of innocent people."{{sfn|United Nations|2000|pp=269–270}} In 1986, the United Kingdom announced that it would provide military aid to Botswana to stop South Africa's raids.{{sfn|Europa Publications|2003|p=93}} 
*{{flagu|United States}}: The raid prompted the [[United States]] to recall its ambassador to South Africa.{{sfn|Parks|1985}}

===United Nations Resolution===
{{Main|United Nations Security Council Resolution 568}}
On 17 June 1985, the [[United Nations]] representative of Botswana sent a letter to the [[President of the United Nations Security Council|President]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] asking for help to deal with the raid. The representative from South Africa sent a letter on the same day stating that Botswana had been warned about harbouring groups like the ANC, citing that "a State had a right to take appropriate steps to protect its own security and territorial integrity against such attacks."{{sfn|United Nations|2000|p=269}} The Botswana Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the evidence of terrorist activities starting in Botswana was fabricated. South Africa responded that since Botswana did not sign the [[Nkomati Accord]], a non-aggression pact with South Africa, the ANC was able to use Botswana as a base for its attacks.{{sfn|United Nations|2000|p=270}} Resolution 568 was drafted on 21 June 1985 that ordered South Africa to pay Botswana for damages, allowed Botswana to house refugees, and encouraged other countries to help Botswana and condemn South Africa.

Hundreds of [[replica]]s of the [[Statue of Liberty]] (''Liberty Enlightening the World'') have been created worldwide.

==France==
===Paris===
====Musée d'Orsay====
[[File:Statue de la liberte.jpg|thumb|left|The Exposition Universelle model in its previous location in the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]], Paris]]
On the occasion of the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle of 1900]], [[Frédéric Bartholdi]] crafted a smaller version of ''Liberty Enlightening the World'', which he subsequently gave to the Musée du Luxembourg. In 1905, the statue was placed outside the museum in the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]], where it stood for over a century, until 2014. It currently stands within the entrance hall to the [[Musée d'Orsay]], and a newly constructed bronze replica stands in its place in the Jardin du Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/overview/actualites/lady-liberty-in-orsay.html#c67912 |title=The Musée d'Orsay's Liberty |website=[[Musée d'Orsay]] |accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Île aux Cygnes====
[[File:Statue of Liberty Paris 001.jpg|thumb|Statue of Liberty on the [[Île aux Cygnes]], River Seine in Paris. Given to the city in 1889, it faces southwest, downriver along the Seine.]]
This statue was given in 1889 to France by U.S. citizens&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E4DE143AEF33A25756C0A9619C94689FD7CF |title=France's Liberty Statue; A Copy of that on Bedlow's Island. Ceremonies at the Inauguration in Paris of the Replica of Bartholdi's Great Work |date=July 5, 1889 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; living in Paris to celebrate the [[French Revolution]] three years after the main statue in New York was inaugurated. In 1937, the statue was turned from looking east to looking west straight to the direction of the New York's statue.

The statue is near the [[Pont de Grenelle|Grenelle Bridge]] on the [[Île aux Cygnes]], a man-made island in the [[Seine]] ({{Coord|48|51|0|N|2|16|47|E|}}). It is {{convert|11.50|m|ftin|abbr=off}} high and weighs 14 tons.&lt;ref name=japantimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/1998/04/28/national/statue-illumination-kicks-off-year-of-france-event/ |title=Statue illumination kicks off ‘Year of France’ event |date=April 28, 1998 |newspaper=[[Japan Times]] |accessdate=October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inaugurated on July 4, 1889, it looks southwest, downriver along the Seine. Its tablet bears two dates: "IV JUILLET 1776" (July 4, 1776: the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]) like the New York statue, and "XIV JUILLET 1789" (July 14, 1789: the [[storming of the Bastille]]) associated with an equal sign. This statue is shown in the film ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' as a historic location.

====Musée des Arts et Métiers====
The {{convert|2.86|m|ft|adj=on}} tall original plaster [[maquette]] finished in 1878 by Auguste Bartholdi that was used to make the statue in New York is in the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Belot |first2=Daniel |last2=Bermond |title=Bartholdi |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Perrin |year=2004 |isbn=978-2-26201-991-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. L. Kallop, Jr., ''Images of Liberty. Models and reductions of the Statue of Liberty 1867–1917'', Special Centennial Exhibition 25 Janvier–15 Février 1986&lt;/ref&gt; This original plaster was bequeathed by the artist's widow in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;Legal instrument prepared by M. Demanche, notary, on March 1, 1907 (Inv13768ter in the Museum archives).&lt;/ref&gt; together with part of the artist's estate.

On the square outside the Musée des Arts et Métiers{{'}}s entrance is a bronze copy made from the plaster maquette, number 1 from an original edition of 12, made by the museum and cast by Susse Fondeur Paris.

====''Flame of Liberty''====
A life-size copy of the torch, ''[[Flame of Liberty]]'', can be seen above the entrance to the [[Pont de l'Alma]] tunnel near the [[Champs-Élysées]] in Paris. It was given to the city as a return gift in honor of the centennial celebration of the statue's dedication. Since it is above the Pont de l'Alma car tunnel in which [[Princess Diana]] died, the torch became an unofficial memorial to the princess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

===Barentin===
There is a replica in the northwest of France, in the small town of Barentin near [[Rouen]]. It was made for a French movie, ''Le Cerveau'' ("The Brain"), directed by Gérard Oury and featuring actors [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] and [[Bourvil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statueofliberty.info/pages/statue/mondeba.htm |title=Les Statues dans le monde |accessdate=May 28, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210152719/http://www.statueofliberty.info/pages/statue/mondeba.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}: image and description of the Barentin replica from the personal website of a Statue of Liberty enthusiast.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bordeaux===
Another replica is a {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} statue in the city of [[Bordeaux]]. The first Bordeaux statue was seized and melted down by the Nazis in World War II. The statue was replaced in 2000 and a plaque was added to commemorate the victims of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]]. On the night of March 25, 2003, unknown vandals poured red paint and gasoline on the replica and set it on fire. The vandals also cracked the pedestal of the plaque. The mayor of Bordeaux, former prime minister [[Alain Juppé]], condemned the attack.

===Colmar===
[[File:ColmarStatueLibertérRéplique.jpg|thumb|Replica of the Statue of Liberty in [[Colmar]]]]
A {{convert|12|m|ftin|abbr=on}} replica of the Statue of Liberty in [[Colmar]], the city of [[Frédéric Bartholdi|Bartholdi's]] birth, was dedicated on July 4, 2004, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his death.

===Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer===
Frédéric Bartholdi donated a copy of the Statue of Liberty to the town square of [[Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer]].

Other ''Liberty Enlightening the World'' statues are displayed in [[Poitiers]] and [[Lunel]]. The [[Musée des beaux-arts de Lyon]] owns a terracotta version.

Near [[Chaumont, Haute Marne]], is a miniature replica in the flag plaza of the former [[Chaumont Air Base]]. This was the home of the US 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, now based at Lakenheath, England, with its own statue at the flag plaza. The 48th TFW is the only USAF wing with a name: "The Statue of Liberty Wing".

Another example is of a ''Liberty Enlightening the World'' replica in [[Châteauneuf-la-Forêt]], near the city of [[Limoges]] in the area of [[Haute-Vienne]], [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]]. There is another "original" Bartholdi replica at [[Roybon]] (near Grenoble)

In Graz, standing between the [[Graz Opera|Opera House]] and the NextLiberty Theater, stands a steel structure built out of steel beams, that depict the original size of the statue of liberty, before the plates of the final form were being put into place.

A {{convert|17|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 9,200 kg (9.2 tons) replica stood atop the Liberty Shoe factory in [[Leicester]], England, until 2002 when the building was demolished. The statue was put into storage while the building was replaced. The statue, which dates back to the 1920s, was initially going to be put back on the replacement building, but was too heavy, so in December 2008 following restoration, it was placed on a pedestal near Liberty Park Halls of Residence on a traffic island, "Liberty Circus", close to where it originally stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/7478419.stm |title=Landmark could return to skyline |date=June 27, 2008 |website=BBC News |accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leicester.gov.uk/newssite/index01.asp?pgid=8903 |title=Work begins on replacing statue |date=November 20, 2008 |website=Leicester City Council |accessdate=August 1, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227051726/http://www.leicester.gov.uk/newssite/index01.asp?pgid=8903 |archivedate=December 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was the brainchild of Kansas City businessman J.P. Whitaker, who was then Scout Commissioner of the [[Kansas City Area Council]]. The copper statues were manufactured by Friedley-Voshardt Co. (Chicago, Illinois) and purchased through the Kansas City Boy Scout office by those wanting one. The statues are approximately {{convert|8+1/2|ft|m}} tall without the base, are constructed of sheet copper, weigh {{convert|290|lb|kg}}, and originally cost $350 plus freight. The mass-produced statues are not great art nor meticulously accurate (a conservator notes that "her face isn't as mature as the real Liberty. It's rounder and more like a little girl's"), but they are cherished, particularly since [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]].

===Philippines===
As early as January 1945, there were already news of a campaign that would help erect a Statue of Liberty replica in the [[Philippines]]. The said monument was supposed to be sponsored by The Chicago Daily Times whose goal was “to commemorate one of the great epics in the struggle for human freedom–the liberation of the Philippines.”

Fast forward to 1950, the Boy Scouts of America was celebrating its 40th anniversary. Jack P. Whitaker, then Scout Commissioner of the Kansas City Area Council, had earlier suggested the creation and distribution of several Statue of Liberty replicas to all American states and territories, including the Philippines.

[[File:Carlos P. Romulo (on the left) and Arthur A. Shuck.jpg|thumb|Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck presenting to [[Carlos P. Romulo]] a miniature of the Statue of Liberty in April 1950.]]

The eight-foot statues, which were cast in bronze, were distributed all over the U.S. and the world from 1949 to 1951. Almost 200 replicas were delivered to the 39 states of the U.S. and countries such as Panama and Puerto Rico. The [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]], on the other hand, received its own replica in the early part of 1950.

The statues were donated by the Boy Scouts of America as “an expression of scout brotherhood and goodwill.” Not surprisingly, their 40th anniversary theme was “Strengthen the Arm of Liberty.”

Miniature versions of the statue were also given as gifts. In fact, the Philippines became the first independent nation to receive one of the 4,000 eight-inch statues from the Boy Scouts of America. In April 1950, the said statue was officially given by Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck to [[Carlos P. Romulo]], then chief of the Philippine Mission to the United Nations.

In the Philippines, several places were suggested as the site where the eight-foot bronze replica would be erected. The task of choosing the perfect site was delegated to the National Urban Planning Commission, and among those it considered were “Engineer Island, atop the proposed reviewing stand on the [[Rizal Park]], and on the center island rotunda between the [[Old Legislative building]] and [[Manila City Hall]].”

In the end, the [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]] (BSP) erected the statue just outside [[Intramuros]]. As the icon of the United States, the replica of Lady Liberty would survive several attacks by student protesters in the 1960s. It remained standing until the early 1970s, when the BSP decided to transfer it to the Scout Reservation in [[Mt. Makiling]] which would serve as the statue’s home for two decades or so.



In a 2002 article published by the Philippine Star, then BSP PR head Nixon Canlapan revealed that the Statue of Liberty was eventually moved and stored at the BSP headquarters on Concepcion Street (now Natividad Almeda-Lopez) in Ermita, Manila.

Turns out, the American-sponsored replica was not the first Lady Liberty in [[Manila]]. In the 1930s, one of Manila’s biggest shopping stores at that time became the talk of the town not just for its products but also for its unique multi-story building. Located in Juan Luna Street, the L.R. Aguinaldo’s Emporium had an Art Deco facade featuring two contrasting statues: [[Andres Bonifacio]] on the right and the Statue of Liberty on the left.

[[File:Souvenir postcard featuring the L.R. Aguinaldo Building in Juan Luna St., Manila.jpg|thumb|Established by the Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the L.R. Aguinaldo's Emporium was once one of the biggest shopping stores in pre-war Manila, located in Juan Luna Street, Manila. The multi-story building's facade featured a statue of Andres Bonifacio on the right and a replica of the statue of Liberty on the left.]]

Established by Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the store would later become known as the Aguinaldo’s Department Store. After the war, Leopoldo’s son Francisco took over the business and the store was moved to Echague.

The Echague branch in the 1950s was known for introducing its customers to quality products both from the Philippines and abroad. It also commissioned young interior designers to update the store’s furniture section. Thus, the store catapulted the careers of famous designers like Myra Cruz, Edgar Ramirez, and Bonnie Ramos, among others. Aguinaldo’s succumbed to the competition and closed in the 1960s. The original building in Juan Luna Street still stands, along with both the Bonifacio and the Liberty statues.

Since the creation of the Liberty statues in Intramuros and Juan Luna Street, other Philippine provinces soon followed suit. Statue of Liberty replicas in can be found in [[Pangasinan]] and as far as [[Camp John Hay]] amphitheater in [[Baguio City]].

===Thailand===

* The Mini Siam and Mini Europe [[Miniature park|model village]], in [[Pattaya]], has a miniature Statue of Liberty amongst others.

===Taiwan===
There are at least two Statue of Liberty replicas (greater than 30 feet in height) in [[Taiwan]]. These two statues are in the cities of [[Keelung]] and [[Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sandy H. 何聖欣 |url=http://sandyintaiwan.blogspot.com/2007/08/statues-of-liberty.html#links |title=Sandy's Neipu Notebook: Statues of Liberty |website=Blogspot.com |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
From 1887 to 1945, [[Hanoi]] was home to another copy of the statue. Measuring {{convert|2.85|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, it was erected by the French colonial government after being sent from France for an exhibition. It was known to locals unaware of its history as ''[[:vi:Tượng bà đầm xòe|Tượng Bà đầm xòe]]'' (''Statue of the madame saux''). When the French lost control of [[French Indochina]] during World War II, the statue was toppled on August 1, 1945, after being deemed a vestige of the colonial government along with other statues erected by the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vietnamnet.vn/thuhanoi/2005/08/474419/ |title=Hà Nội từng có tượng Thần Tự Do trên nóc Tháp Rùa? |trans-title=Has Hanoi ever had the Statue of Liberty on the roof of the Turtle Tower? |website=Vietnam Net |language=Vietnamese |date=1 August 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708104847/http://www.vietnamnet.vn/thuhanoi/2005/08/474419/ |archivedate=July 8, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1286">The '''School Meals Initiative for Healthy Children''' (SMI) was an initiative established by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] in 1994 to revise and update nutrition standards for school meals and require them comply with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for children over age two. The SMI required school meals to:

* Contain less than 30 percent of calories from fat and 10 percent of calories from saturated fat over the course of a week
* Meet one-third of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for protein, calcium, iron, vitamin A, vitamin C, and specific levels of calories for specified age groups
* Comply with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for children over the age of 2

The SMI has been superseded by new school nutrition standards set by the [[Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8498">[[File:Communist Block.svg|thumb|250px|States that had communist governments in red, states that the Soviet Union believed at one point to be "moving toward socialism" in orange and other socialist nations in yellow (note that not all of the bright red states remained Soviet allies)]]
In the political terminology of the former [[Soviet Union]], the '''socialist-leaning countries''' ({{lang-ru|Страны социалистической ориентации|lit=countries of socialist orientation|translit=Strany sotsialisticheskoy oriyentatsii}}) were the [[post-colonial]] [[Third World]] countries which the Soviet Union recognized as adhering to the ideas of [[State socialism|socialism]] in the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] understanding. As a result, these countries received significant economic and military support.&lt;ref name=tre&gt;[[Dmitri Trenin]] (2011). ''Post-Imperium: A Eurasian Story''. Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  [http://carnegieendowment.org/pdf/book/post-imperium.pdf p. 144].&lt;/ref&gt; In Soviet press, these states were also called "countries on the path of the construction of socialism" ({{lang-ru| страны, идущие по пути строительства социализма|translit=strany, idushchiye po puti stroitel'stva sotsializma}}) and countries on the path of the socialist development" ({{lang-ru| страны, стоящие на пути социалиcтического развития|translit=strany, stoyashchiye na puti sotsialicticheskogo razvitiya}}). All these terms meant to draw a distinction from the true [[socialist state]]s (in Marxist–Leninist understanding).&lt;ref name="aes"&gt;[http://africa-tur.ru/aboutafrica/741/3186/ "СОЦИАЛИСТИЧЕСКАЯ ОРИЕНТАЦИЯ"]. An article from the 1986–1987 Soviet reference book ''Afrika. Entsiklopedicheskiy spravochnik''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term was partly a result of a reassessment of [[national liberation]] movements in the Third World following World War II, widespread [[decolonization]] and the emergence of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] as well as [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Secret Speech]] to the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the "[[de-Stalinization]]" of [[Soviet Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tareq, Ismael (2005). ''The Communist Movement in the Arab World''. London. Rutledge. Print. pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion of anti-colonial struggle at the Second Congress of the [[Comintern]] in 1920 had been formulated in terms of a debate between those for an alliance with the anti-imperialist national bourgeoisie (initially advocated by [[Vladimir Lenin]]) and those for a pure class line of socialist, anti-feudal as well as anti-imperialist struggle (such as [[M. N. Roy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. “Report of the Commission on the National and the Colonial Question.” Collected Works, Vol. 31. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1965. Pp. 213-263. https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The revolutions of the post-war decolonization era (excepting those led by explicitly proletarian forces, such as the [[Vietnamese Revolution]]), e.g. the rise of [[Nasserism]], were initially seen by many communists as a new form of bourgeois nationalism and there were often sharp conflicts between nationalists and communists.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the adoption of “leftist” economic programs (such as [[nationalization]] and/or [[land reform]]) by many of these movements and governments as well as the international alliances between the [[left-wing nationalism|revolutionary nationalists]] and the Soviet Union obliged communists to reassess their nature. These movements were now seen as neither classical bourgeois nationalists nor socialist per se, but rather offering the possibility of "non-capitalist development" as a path of "transition to socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times, these states included [[Algeria]], [[Angola]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Mozambique]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[Libya]], [[Ethiopia]], [[South Yemen]] and many others.&lt;ref name=tre/&gt;&lt;ref name=aes/&gt; As a major embarrassment to the Soviets, emperor and alleged [[cannibalism|cannibal]] [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] of what had been (and later again became) the Central African Republic had at one time had declared his adherence to "scientific socialism" in order to secure the free Soviet economic assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2012/02/02/black-history-month-2012-emperor-bokassas-coronation/ "Black History Month 2012: Emperor Bokassa’s Coronation"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Soviet political science, "socialist orientation" was defined to be an initial period of the development in countries which rejected [[capitalism]], but did not yet have the prerequisites for the socialist revolution or development. Along these lines, a more cautious synonym was used, namely "countries on the path of non-capitalist development". A 1986 Soviet reference book on Africa claimed that about one third of African states followed this path.&lt;ref name=aes/&gt;

In some countries designated "socialist-leaning" by the Soviet Union such as India, this formulation was sharply criticized by emerging [[Maoism|Maoist]] or Chinese-leaning groups, such as the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], who considered the doctrine class collaborationist as part of the larger [[Sino-Soviet split]] and the Maoist struggle against so-called Soviet [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11221">The '''Speedy Trial Act of 1974''' (88 Stat. 2080, as amended August 2, 1979, 93 Stat. 328, {{UnitedStatesCode|18|3161|3174}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-II/chapter-208 Title 18, Chapter 208 of the United States Code] from the [[Legal Information Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;), establishes time limits for completing the various stages of a federal criminal prosecution.

==Procedural time limits==
The Act establishes time limits for completing the various stages of a federal criminal prosecution. The [[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]] or [[indictment]] must be filed within 30 days from the date of arrest or service of the summons.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Trial must commence within 70 days from the date the information or indictment was filed, or from the date the defendant appears before an officer of the court in which the charge is pending, whichever is later.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|c|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in order to ensure that defendants are not rushed to trial without an adequate opportunity to prepare, Congress amended the Act in 1979 to provide a minimum time period during which trial may not commence.&lt;ref&gt;Speedy Trial Act Amendments of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-43, Section 3, 93 Stat. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Act provides that trial may not begin less than 30 days from the date the defendant first appears in court, unless the defendant agrees in writing to an earlier date.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|c|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[United States v. Rojas-Contreras]]'', 474 U.S. 231 (1985), the Supreme Court held that this 30-day trial preparation period is not restarted upon the filing of a substantially similar superseding indictment.

If the indictment is dismissed at the defendant's request, the Act's provisions apply anew upon reinstatement of the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|d|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the indictment is dismissed at the request of the government, the 70-day clock is tolled during the period when no indictment is outstanding, and begins to run again upon the filing of the second indictment.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|h|6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If trial ends in a mistrial, or the court grants a motion for a new trial, the second trial must begin within 70 days "from the date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final."&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|e|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delays which are not included in the Act===
Certain pretrial delays are automatically excluded from the Act's time limits, such as delays caused by pretrial [[Motion (legal)|motions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|h|1|F}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Henderson v. United States (1986)|Henderson v. United States]]'', 476 U.S. 321, 330 (1986), the Supreme Court held that {{USCSec|18|3161|h|1|F)}} excludes "all time between the filing of a motion and the conclusion of the hearing on that motion, whether or not a delay in holding that hearing is 'reasonably necessary.'" The Act also excludes a reasonable period (up to 30 days) during which a motion is actually "under advisement" by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|h|1|J}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other delays excluded from the Act's time limits include delays caused by the unavailability of the defendant or an essential witness ({{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|h|3}}); delays attributable to a co-defendant ({{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|h|7|}}); and delays attributable to the defendant's involvement in other proceedings, including delay resulting from an [[interlocutory appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|h|1|E}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Note, however, that the 30-day defense preparation period provided for in {{USCSub2|18|3161|c|2}} is calculated without reference to Section {{USCSub2|18|3161|h}} exclusions).

A defendant may not expressly waive his rights under the Speedy Trial Act.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''United States v. Saltzman'', 984 F.2d 1087, 1090-1092 (10th Cir. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the trial judge determines that the "ends of justice" served by a continuance outweigh the interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, the delay occasioned by such continuance is excluded from the Act's time limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|h|8|A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge must set forth, orally or in writing, his or her reasons for granting the continuance.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|h|8|A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act provides a sanction of [[Involuntary dismissal|dismissal]] for violation of its time limits that may be with or without prejudice to reprosecution. In assessing whether dismissal should be with prejudice, the court must consider the seriousness of the offense, the circumstances leading to dismissal, and the impact that reprosecution would have on the administration of the Act and on the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3161|a|1}}–{{USCSub2|18|3161|a|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[United States v. Taylor]]'', 487 U.S. 326 (1988), the Supreme Court held that a trial court must examine each statutory factor in deciding to dismiss charges with prejudice. The Court in Taylor found that a minor violation of the time limitations of the act that did not prejudice the defendant's trial preparation did not justify the dismissal with prejudice of an indictment charging serious drug offenses.

While a defendant cannot unilaterally waive his rights under the Speedy Trial Act, he can forfeit his right to obtain a dismissal of the case for a claimed violation of the Act by failing to move for dismissal prior to trial. The statute provides that "[f]ailure of the defendant to move for dismissal prior to trial...shall constitute a waiver of the right to dismissal under this section."&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|3162|a|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Juvenile proceedings==
The Speedy Trial Act is inapplicable to [[juvenile delinquency]] proceedings, which have their own speedy trial provision.&lt;ref&gt;See {{UnitedStatesCode|18|5036}} (speedy trial provision of the Juvenile Delinquency Act)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) provides its own time limits for persons incarcerated in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18a/usc_sec_18a_01000002----000-.html 18 U.S.C. Appendix 2, § 2], Articles III-VI.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case, the government must comply with both the time limits of the IAD and the Speedy Trial Act.

==Constitutional basis==
{{main|Speedy Trial Clause}}

A defendant's right to a speedy trial has constitutional and statutory underpinnings in addition to the Speedy Trial Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are Speedy Trial Rights|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-speedy-trial-rights|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=18 March 2018|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal statutes of limitations provide a time frame within which charges must be filed. Moreover, Rule {{frcrp|48}} of the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]], grants trial courts discretion to dismiss cases that are not brought to trial promptly.&lt;ref&gt;See Rule {{frcrp|48}}(b), Fed. R. Crim. P. (authorizing trial court to dismiss indictment if there is "unnecessary delay" in presenting the charge to a grand jury, in filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if a charge is brought within the period provided by the statute of limitations, a defendant may be able to show that preaccusation delay has violated his or her [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] due process rights. To obtain a dismissal of the charges by reason of pre-indictment delay, a defendant has the burden of establishing that the government engaged in intentional delay to gain a tactical advantage, and that he suffered actual prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Lovasco]]'', 431 U.S. 783 (1977); ''[[United States v. Marion]]'', 404 U.S. 307, 324 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

A defendant's rights under the [[Speedy Trial Clause]] of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] are triggered by "either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Marion'', 404 U.S. 307, 320 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; (As noted above, any delay before this time must be scrutinized under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the Fifth Amendment, not the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. MacDonald]]'', 456 U.S. 1, 7 (1982)).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Barker v. Wingo]]'', 407 U.S. 514 (1972), the Supreme Court set out a four-factor test for determining whether delay between the initiation of criminal proceedings and the beginning of trial violates a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The test requires the court to consider the length of the delay, the cause of the delay, the defendant's assertion of his or her right to a speedy trial, and the presence or absence of prejudice resulting from the delay.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barker v. Wingo]], 407 U.S. at 530-533.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Loud Hawk]]'', 474 U.S. 302 (1986), where the reason for the 90-month delay (interlocutory appeals) did not weigh against the government, the Supreme Court held that the possibility of prejudice occasioned by the delay was not sufficient to establish a Sixth Amendment speedy trial violation. Moreover, the courts of appeals routinely reject Sixth Amendment speedy trial challenges in the absence of a showing of prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''United States v. Tannehill'', 49 F.3d 1049, 1054 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 167 (1995); United States v. Baker, 63 F.3d 1478, 1497 (9th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 824 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[Doggett v. United States]]'', 505 U.S. 647 (1992), the Supreme Court held that an "extraordinary" eight-and-one-half-year delay between the defendant's indictment and arrest, which resulted from the government's "egregious persistence in failing to prosecute [him]," violated his right to a speedy trial even in the absence of "affirmative proof of particularized prejudice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Doggett v. United States]], 505 U.S. at 652, 655, 657.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there are successive state and federal prosecutions, the general rule is that the federal constitutional speedy trial right does not arise until a federal accusation against the defendant is made. Thus, a prior state arrest based on the same facts as the subsequent federal charge does not implicate the federal constitutional guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Walker'', 710 F.2d 1062, 1069 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1005 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Shōwa Statism'''|国家主義|Kokka Shugi}} was a [[Syncretic politics|political syncretism]] of [[Japan]]ese extreme [[right-wing]] political [[ideology|ideologies]], developed over a period of time from the [[Meiji Restoration]]. It is sometimes also referred to as '''Shōwa nationalism''' or '''Japanese fascism'''.

This [[Statism|statist]] movement dominated Japanese politics during the first part of the [[Shōwa period]] (reign of [[Hirohito]]). It was a mixture of ideas such as [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese ultranationalism]], [[Japanese militarism|militarism]] and [[state capitalism]], that were proposed by a number of contemporary political philosophers and thinkers in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].

==Origins==
{{Fascism sidebar}}
With a more aggressive foreign policy, and victory over China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and over [[Imperial Russia]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Japan joined the imperialist powers. The need for a strong military to secure Japan's new overseas empire was strengthened by a sense that only through a strong military would Japan earn the respect of Western nations, and thus revision of the [[unequal treaty|"unequal treaties"]] imposed in the 1800s.

The Japanese military viewed itself as "politically clean" in terms of corruption, and criticized political parties under a [[liberal democracy]] as self-serving and a threat to national security by their failure to provide adequate military spending or to address pressing social and economic issues. The complicity of the politicians with the ''[[zaibatsu]]'' corporate monopolies also came under criticism. The military tended to favor [[dirigisme]] and other forms of direct state control over industry, rather than free market [[capitalism]], as well as greater state-sponsored [[social welfare]] to reduce the attraction of [[socialism]] and [[communism]] in Japan.

The special relation of militarists and the central civil government with the Imperial Family supported the important position of the Emperor as Head of State with political powers, and the relationship with the nationalist right-wing movements. However, Japanese political thought had relatively little contact with European political thinking until the 20th century.

Under this ascendancy of the military, the country developed a very hierarchical, aristocratic economic system with significant state involvement. During the [[Meiji Restoration]], there had been a surge in the creation of monopolies. This was in part due to state intervention, as the monopolies served to allow Japan to become a world economic power. The state itself owned some of the monopolies, and others were owned by the zaibatsu. The monopolies managed the central core of the economy, with other aspects being controlled by the government ministry appropriate to the activity, including the National Central Bank and the Imperial family. This economic arrangement was in many ways similar to the later [[corporatism|corporatist]] models of European fascists.

During the same period, certain thinkers with ideals similar to those from [[Shōgun|shogunate]] times developed the early basis of Japanese [[expansionism]] and [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asianist]] theories. Such thought later was developed by writers such as Saneshige Komaki into the ''[[Hakkō ichiu]]'', [[Yen Block]], and Amau doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Akihiko Takagi, [http://www.nuim.ie/staff/dpringle/igu/takagi.pdf] {{deadlink|date=July 2015}} mentions "''Nippon Chiseigaku Sengen'' ("A manifesto of Japanese Geopolitics") written in 1940 by Saneshige Komaki, a professor of Kyoto Imperial University and one of the representatives of the Kyoto school, [as] an example of the merging of geopolitics into Japanese traditional ultranationalism."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments in the Shōwa era==

===International Policy===
The 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] did not recognize the [[Empire of Japan]]'s territorial claims, and international naval treaties between Western powers and the [[Empire of Japan]], ([[Washington Naval Treaty]] and [[London Naval Treaty]]), imposed limitations on naval [[shipbuilding]] which limited the size of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] at a 10:10:6 ratio. These measures were considered by many in Japan as refusal of by the Occidental powers to consider Japan an equal partner. The latter brought about the [[May 15 Incident]].

On the basis national security, these events released a surge of Japanese nationalism and resulted in the end of collaboration diplomacy which supported peaceful economic expansion. The implementation of a military dictatorship and territorial expansionism were considered the best ways to protect the [[Yamato-damashii]].

===Civil discourse on statism===
In the early 1930s, the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] began arresting left-wing political dissidents, generally in order to exact a confession and renouncement of anti-state leanings. Over 30,000 such arrests were made between 1930 and 1933. In response, a large group of writers founded a Japanese branch of the International Popular Front Against Fascism, and published articles in major literary journals warning of the dangers of statism. Their periodical, ''The People's Library'' (人民文庫), achieved a circulation of over five thousand and was widely read in literary circles, but was eventually censored, and later dismantled in January 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Richard|editor1-last=Tansman|editor1-first=Alan|title=The culture of Japanese fascism|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=0822344521|pages=56, 64–5, 74|chapter=The People's Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works of Ikki Kita===
[[Ikki Kita]] was an early 20th-century political theorist, who advocated a hybrid of [[state socialism]] with "Asian nationalism", which thus blended the early ultranationalist movement with Japanese militarism. His political philosophy was outlined in his thesis {{nihongo|National Policy and Pure Socialism|ja|国体論及び純正社会主義|lt=''National Policy and Pure Socialism''}} ({{lang|ja|国体論及び純正社会主義}} ''{{transl|ja|Kokutai ron oyobi junsei shakai shugi}}'') of 1908 and {{illm|An Outline Plan for the Reorganization of Japan|ja|日本改造法案大綱|lt=''An Outline Plan for the Reorganization of Japan''}} ({{lang|ja|日本改造法案大綱}} ''{{transl|ja|Nihon Kaizō Hōan Taikō}}'') of 1928. Kita proposed a military [[coup d'état]] to replace the existing political structure of Japan with a [[military dictatorship]]. The new military leadership would rescind the [[Meiji Constitution]], ban [[political parties]], replace the [[Diet of Japan]] with an assembly free of corruption, and would [[nationalization|nationalize]] major industries. Kita also envisioned strict limits to private ownership of property, and [[land reform]] to improve the lot of [[tenant farmers]]. Thus strengthened internally, Japan could then embark on a crusade to free all of Asia from Western [[imperialism]].

Although his works were banned by the government almost immediately after publication, circulation was widespread, and his thesis proved popular not only with the younger officer class excited at the prospects of military rule and Japanese expansionism, but with the [[populism|populist]] movement for its appeal to the [[agrarianism|agrarian classes]] and to the left wing of the [[Socialist thought in Imperial Japan|socialist movement]].

===Works of Shūmei Ōkawa===
[[File:OKAWA Shumei.jpg|thumb|150px|A Japanese [[Pan-Asian]] writer [[Shūmei Ōkawa]].]]

[[Shūmei Ōkawa]] was a right-wing political philosopher, active in numerous Japanese nationalist societies in the 1920s. In 1926, he published {{nihongo|Japan and the Way of the Japanese|日本及び日本人の道|Nihon oyobi Nihonjin no michi}}, among other works, which helped popularize the concept of the inevitability of a [[clash of civilizations]] between Japan and the west. Politically, his theories built on the works of Ikki Kita, but further emphasized that Japan needed to return to its traditional ''[[kokutai]]'' traditions in order to survive the increasing social tensions created by [[industrialization]] and foreign cultural influences.

===Works of Sadao Araki===
[[File:Araki Sadao.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Sadao Araki]], Army Minister, Education Minister in the [[Fumimaro Konoe|Konoe]] cabinet]]
[[Sadao Araki]] was a noted political philosopher in the Imperial Japanese Army during the 1920s, who had a wide following within the junior officer corps. Although implicated in the February 26 Incident, he went on to serve in numerous influential government posts, and was a cabinet minister under [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]].

The Japanese Army, already trained along [[Prussia]]n lines since the early Meiji period, often mentioned the affinity between ''[[yamato-damashii]]'' and the "Prussian Military Spirit" in pushing for a military alliance with Italy and Germany along with the need to combat Soviet [[communism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Araki's writing are imbued with nostalgia towards the military administrative system of former shogunate, in a similar manner to which the [[Fascist Party]] of Italy looked back to the ancient ideals of the [[Roman Empire]] or the [[NSDAP]] in Germany recalled an idealized version of [[First Reich]] and the [[Teutonic Order]].

Araki modified the interpretation of the ''bushido'' warrior code to ''[[seishin kyōiku]]'' ("spiritual training"), which he introduced to the military as Army Minister, and to the general public as Education Minister, and in general brought the concepts of the Showa Restoration movement into mainstream Japanese politics.

Some of the distinctive features of this policy were also used outside Japan. The [[puppet state]]s of [[Manchukuo]], [[Mengjiang]], and the [[Wang Jingwei Government]] were later organized party in accordance with Araki's ideas. In the case of [[Wang Jingwei]]'s state, he himself had some [[Third Reich|German]] influences—prior to the Japanese invasion of China, he met with German leaders and picked up some fascist ideas during his time in the [[Kuomingtang]]. These, he combined with Japanese militarist thinking. Japanese agents also supported local and nationalist elements in [[Southeast asia]] and [[White Movement|White Russian]] residents in [[Manchukuo]] before war broke out.

===Works of Seigō Nakano===

[[File:Seigo Nakano.JPG|thumb|150px|Seigō Nakano]]

[[Seigō Nakano]] sought to bring about a rebirth of Japan through a blend of the [[samurai]] ethic, [[Neo-Confucianism]], and [[populism|populist]] [[nationalism]] modeled on European [[fascism]]. He saw [[Saigō Takamori]] as epitomizing the 'true spirit' of the [[Meiji Restoration|Meiji ''ishin'']], and the task of modern Japan to recapture it.

===Shōwa Restoration Movement===
Ikki Kita and Shūmei Ōkawa joined forces in 1919 to organize the short-lived [[Yūzonsha]] (猶存社), a political study group intended to become an umbrella organization for the various right-socialist movements. Although the group soon collapsed due to irreconcilable ideological differences between Kita and Ōkawa, it served its purpose in that it managed to join the right-wing anti-socialist, Pan-Asian militarist societies with centrist and left-wing supporters of state socialism.

In the 1920s and 1930s, these supporters of Japanese statism used the slogan {{nihongo|Showa Restoration|昭和維新|Shōwa isshin}}, which implied that a new resolution was needed to replace the existing political order dominated by corrupt politicians and capitalists, with one which (in their eyes), would fulfill the original goals of the Meiji Restoration of direct Imperial rule via military proxies.

However, the Shōwa Restoration had different meanings for different groups. For the radicals of the ''[[Sakurakai]]'', it meant violent overthrow of the government to create a [[national syndicalist]] state with more equitable distribution of wealth and the removal of corrupt politicians and ''zaibatsu'' leaders. For the young officers it meant a return to some form of "military-shogunate in which the emperor would re-assume direct political power with dictatorial attributes, as well as divine symbolism, without the intervention of the Diet or liberal democracy, but who would effectively be a figurehead with day-to-day decisions left to the military leadership.

Another point of view was supported by [[Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu|Prince Chichibu]], a brother of [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa]], who repeatedly counseled him to implement a ''direct imperial rule'', even if that meant suspending the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2001, p.284&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, some theorists proposed [[Shōwa Restoration]], the plan of giving direct [[dictatorial]] powers to the Emperor (due to his [[divinity|divine]] attributes) for leading the future overseas actions in mainland Asia. This was the purpose behind the [[February 26 Incident]] and other similar uprisings in Japan. Later, however, these previously mentioned thinkers decided to organize their own political clique based on previous radical, militaristic movements in the 1930s; this was the origin of the [[Kodoha]] party and their political desire to take direct control of all the [[political power]] in the country from the moderate and democratic political voices.

Following the formation of this "political clique", there was a new current of thought among militarists, industrialists and landowners that emphasized a desire to return to the ancient shogunate system, but in the form of a modern military dictatorship with new structures. It was organized with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] acting as [[clan]]s under command of a supreme military native dictator (the ''[[shōgun]]'') controlling the country. In this government, the Emperor was covertly reduced in his functions and used as a figurehead for political or religious use under the control of the militarists.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The failure of various attempted coups, including the [[League of Blood Incident]], the [[October incident|Imperial Colors Incident]] and the [[February 26 Incident]], discredited supporters of the Shōwa Restoration movement, but the concepts of Japanese statism migrated to mainstream Japanese politics, where it joined with some elements of European [[fascism]].

===Comparisons with European fascism===
Early Shōwa statism is sometimes given the retrospective label "fascism", but this was not a self-appellation and it is clear that the comparison is inaccurate. When authoritarian tools of the state such as the [[Kempeitai]] were put into use in the early Shōwa period, they were employed to protect the rule of law under the [[Meiji Constitution]] from perceived enemies on both the left and the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doak|first1=Kevin|editor1-last=Tansman|editor1-first=Alan|title=The culture of Japanese fascism|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=0822344521|page=44|chapter=Fascism Seen and Unseen|quote=Careful attention to the history of the Special Higher Police, and particularly to their use by Prime Minister Tōjō Hideki against his enemies even further to his political right, reveals that extreme rightists, fascists, and practically anyone deemed to pose a threat to the Meiji constitutional order were at risk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ideologists, such as [[Kingoro Hashimoto]], proposed a single party dictatorship, based on [[egalitarian]] populism, patterned after the European fascist movements. ''[[An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus]]'' shows the influence clearly.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Rhodes, ''Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II'', p246 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

These geopolitical ideals developed into the '''Amau Doctrine''' (天羽声明, an Asian [[Monroe Doctrine]]), stating that Japan assumed total responsibility for peace in Asia, and can be seen later when Prime Minister [[Kōki Hirota]] proclaimed justified Japanese expansion into northern China as the creation of "a special zone, anti-communist, pro-Japanese and pro-Manchukuo" that was a "fundamental part" of Japanese national existence.

Although the reformist right wing, kakushin uyoku, was interested in the concept, the idealist right wing, or kannen uyoku, rejected fascism as they rejected all things of western origin. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Because of the mistrust of unions in such unity, the Japanese went to replace them with "councils" in every factory, containing both management and worker representatives to contain conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Gordon (historian)|Andrew Gordon]], ''A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present'', p195-6, {{ISBN|0-19-511060-9}}, {{OCLC|49704795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Nazi councils they were copying, this was part of a program to create a classless national unity.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gordon, ''A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present'', p196, {{ISBN|0-19-511060-9}}, {{OCLC|49704795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kokuhonsha===
The ''[[Kokuhonsha]]'' was founded in 1924 by [[conservatism|conservative]] [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|Minister of Justice]] and President of the [[Japanese House of Peers|House of Peers]] [[Hiranuma Kiichirō]].&lt;ref&gt;Bix, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; It called on Japanese patriots to reject the various foreign political "-isms" (such as [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], etc.) in favor of a rather vaguely defined "Japanese national spirit" (''[[kokutai]]''). The name "''kokuhon''" was selected as an antithesis to the word "''minpon''", from ''minpon shugi'', the commonly-used translation for the word "[[democracy]]", and the society was openly supportive of [[totalitarian]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Japan in the Fascist Era, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine Right and Way of the Warrior===
One particular concept exploited was a decree ascribed to the mythical first [[emperor of Japan]], Emperor [[Jimmu]], in 660 [[Anno Domini|BC]]: the policy of [[hakkō ichiu]] (八紘一宇, all eight corners of the world under one roof).&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]], ''War Without Mercy: Race &amp; Power in the Pacific War'' p223 {{ISBN|0-394-50030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This also related to the concept of [[kokutai]] or national polity, meaning the uniqueness of the Japanese people in having a leader with spiritual origins.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Rhodes, ''Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II'', p246 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet ''Kokutai no Hongi'' taught that students should put the nation before the self, and that they were part of the state and not separate from it.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Beasley, ''The Rise of Modern Japan'', p 187 {{ISBN|0-312-04077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shinmin no Michi]]'' injoined all Japanese to follow the central precepts of loyalty and filial piety, which would throw aside selfishness and allow them to complete their "holy task."&lt;ref&gt;John W. Dower, ''War Without Mercy: Race &amp; Power in the Pacific War'' p27 {{ISBN|0-394-50030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bases of the modern form of [[kokutai]] and [[hakkō ichiu]] were to develop after 1868 and would take the following form:

#Japan is the center of the world, with its ruler, the [[Emperor of Japan|Tennō]] (Emperor), a divine being, who derives his divinity from ancestral descent from the great [[Amaterasu]]-Ōmikami, the Goddess of the [[Sun]] herself.
#The [[Kami]] (Japan's gods and goddesses) have Japan under their special protection. Thus, the people and soil of [[Dai Nippon]] and all its institutions are superior to all others.
#All of these attributes are fundamental to the [[Kodoshugisha]] (Imperial Way) and give Japan a [[divinity|divine]] mission to bring all nations under one roof, so that all [[human race|humanity]] can share the advantage of being ruled by the [[Emperor of Japan|Tenno]].

The concept of the divine [[Emperor of Japan|Emperors]] was another belief that was to fit the later goals. It was an integral part of the Japanese religious structure that the [[Tennō]] was divine, descended directly from the line of Ama-Terasu (or Amaterasu, the Sun Kami or Goddess).

The final idea that was modified in modern times was the concept of Bushido. [[Bushido]] was the [[warrior code]] and laws of [[feudal Japan]], that while having cultural surface differences, was at its heart not that different from the code of [[chivalry]] or any other similar system in other cultures. In later years, the code of Bushido found a resurgence in belief following the [[Meiji Restoration]]. At first, this allowed Japan to field what was considered one of the most professional and humane [[militaries]] in the world, one respected by friend and foe alike. Eventually, however, this belief would become a combination of [[propaganda]] and [[fanaticism]] that would lead to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] of the 1930s and World War II.

It was the third concept, especially, that would chart Japan's course towards several wars that would culminate with World War II.

===New Order Movement===
{{Main|Taisei Yokusankai}}

[[File:Tokyokaikan before.jpg|thumb|Tokyo Kaikan was requisitioned as the meeting place for members of Imperial Rule Assistance Association (IRAA) in early days.]]

During 1940, Prime Minister [[Fumimaro Konoe]] proclaimed the ''[[Shintaisei]]'' (New National Structure), making Japan into a "National Defense State". Under the [[National Mobilization Law]], the government was given absolute power over the nation's assets. All [[political parties]] were ordered to dissolve into the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]], forming a [[one-party state]] based on [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian values]]. Such measures as the [[National Service Draft Ordinance]] and the [[National Spiritual Mobilization Movement]] were intended to mobilize Japanese society for a [[total war]] against the West.

Associated with government efforts to create a [[statism|statist society]] included creation of the ''[[Tonarigumi]]'' (residents' committees), and emphasis on the ''[[Kokutai no Hongi]]'' ("Japan's Fundamentals of National Policy"), presenting a view of Japan's history, and its mission to unite the East and West under the ''[[Hakkō ichiu]]'' theory in schools as official texts. The official academic text was another book, ''[[Shinmin no Michi]]'' (The Subject's Way), the "moral national Bible", presented an effective catechism on nation, religion, cultural, social, and ideological topics.

==The Axis==

Japan withdrew from the [[League of Nations]] in 1933, bringing it closer to the Third Reich, which also left that year, and Fascist Italy, which was dissatisfied with the League. During the 1930s Japan drifted further away from Western Europe and America. American and French films were increasingly censored, and in 1937 Japan froze all American assets throughout its empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baskett|first1=Michael|editor1-last=Tansman|editor1-first=Alan|title=The Culture of Japanese Fascism|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=0822344521|pages=217–8|chapter=All Beautiful Fascists?: Axis Film Culture in Imperial Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the three countries formed the [[Axis powers]], and became closer linked. Japan imported Nazi propaganda films such as ''[[Ohm Krüger]]'' (1941), advertising them as narratives showing the suffering caused by Western imperialism.

==End of military statism==

Japanese statism was discredited and destroyed by the utter failure of Japan's military in World War II. After the [[surrender of Japan]], Japan was put under [[Occupied Japan|allied occupation]]. Some of its former military leaders were tried for [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] before the [[Tokyo tribunal]], the government educational system was revised, and the tenets of [[liberal democracy]] written into the post-war [[Constitution of Japan]] as one of its key themes.

The collapse of statist ideologies in 1945–46 was paralleled by a formalisation of relations between the [[Shinto]] religion and the Japanese state, including [[established religion|disestablishment]]: termination of Shinto's status as a [[state religion]]. In August 1945, the term [[State Shinto]] (''Kokka Shintō'') was invented to refer to some aspects of statism. On 1 January 1946, Emperor ''Shōwa'' issued an imperial rescript, sometimes referred as the ''[[Ningen-sengen]]'' ("Humanity Declaration") in which he quoted the [[Five Charter Oath]] (''Gokajō no Goseimon'') of his grandfather, [[Emperor Meiji]] and renounced officially "the false conception that the Emperor is a divinity". However, the wording of the Declaration – in the [[court language]] of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial family]], an archaic Japanese dialect known as ''Kyūteigo'' – and content of this statement have been the subject of much debate. For instance, the renunciation did not include the word usually used to impute the Emperor's divinity: ''[[arahitogami]]'' ("living god"). It instead used the unusual word ''akitsumikami'', which was officially translated as "divinity", but more literally meant "manifestation/[[incarnation]] of a ''[[kami]]'' ("god/spirit")". Hence, commentators such as [[John W. Dower]] and [[Herbert P. Bix]] have argued, Hirohito did not specifically deny being a "living god" (''arahitogami'').

'''Tamil National Retrieval Troops (TNRT)''' is a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] Nationalist group who fought for an independent Tamil homeland and aspired to unite [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Tamil Eelam]] to a [[Greater Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name="satp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/terroristoutfits/TNRT.htm |title=Tamil National Retrieval Troops (TNRT) |publisher=Satp.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designated as a [[Terrorist organisation]] by the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mha.gov.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=292 |title=Ministry of Home Affairs |publisher=Mha.gov.in |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425132802/http://mha.gov.in/uniquepage.asp?id_pk=292 |archivedate=2013-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tavini Huiraatira''' ({{lang-en|People's Servant}}) is a [[List of political parties in French Polynesia|political party in French Polynesia]] that favours greater autonomy from its territorial ruler [[France]].

==History==
The party was founded in 1977 by [[Oscar Temaru]] under the name the Front for the Liberation of Polynesia (FLP). The party changed its name in 1983 to Tavini Huiraatira (People's Servant Party).
In 1986, Tavini Huiraatira obtained 2 seats in the territorial assembly, 4 seats in 1991, 11 in 1996, and 13 in 2001. In 2004, the Union for Democracy Coalition takes 27 of the 57 seats.

At the last [[legislative]] [[Elections in French Polynesia|elections]] on May 23, 2004, and [[by-election]]s on February 13, 2005, the party was part of the Union for the Democracy (''Union pour la Démocratie''), that won 27 out of 57 seats.

Oscar Temaru's coalition government program in 2004 included the gradual increase of the minimum wage to 150.000 CFP [[franc|Fcfp]], work days that don’t start before 9am, an improvement of social services, political decentralisation, educational reform, and a revision of the new autonomy statute after French Polynesia was declared a French Overseas Country (''[[pays d'outre-mer]]'') in March 2004.

The '''Tripartite Pact''', also known as the '''Berlin Pact''', was an agreement between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]  signed in [[Berlin]] on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], [[Galeazzo Ciano]] and [[Saburō Kurusu]]. It was a defensive [[military alliance]] that was eventually joined by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] (20 November 1940), [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] (23 November 1940), [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] (1 March 1941) and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (25 March 1941), as well as by the German client state of [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]] (24 November 1940).  [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|Yugoslavia's accession]] provoked a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|''coup d'état'' in Belgrade]] two days later, and Italy and Germany responded by [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invading Yugoslavia]] (with Bulgarian, Hungarian and Romanian assistance) and partitioning the country. The resulting Italo-German client state known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] joined the pact on 15 June 1941.

The Tripartite Pact was directed primarily at the [[United States]]. Its practical effects were limited, since the Italo-German and Japanese operational theatres were on opposite sides of the world and the high contracting powers had disparate strategic interests. Some technical cooperation was carried out, and the [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire|Japanese declaration of war on the United States]] propelled, although it did not require, a similar declaration of war from all the other signatories of the Tripartite Pact.

{{quote|[[File:Tripartite Pact 27 September 1940.jpg|thumb|Japanese version of the Tripartite Pact, 27 September 1940.]]

The Governments of Japan, Germany, and Italy consider it as the condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations in the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned.
It is, furthermore, the desire of the three Governments to extend cooperation to nations in other spheres of the world that are inclined to direct their efforts along lines similar to their own for the purpose of realizing their ultimate object, world peace.
Accordingly, the Governments of Japan, Germany and Italy have agreed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three-Power Pact Between Germany, Italy, and Japan, Signed at Berlin, September 27, 1940 |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/triparti.asp|work=Avalon Law Project|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARTICLE 1. Japan recognizes and respects the leadership of Germany and Italy in the establishment of a new order in Europe.

ARTICLE 2. Germany and Italy recognize and respect the leadership of Japan in the establishment of a new order in Greater East Asia.

ARTICLE 3. Japan, Germany, and Italy agree to cooperate in their efforts on aforesaid lines. They further undertake to assist one another with all political, economic and military means if one of the Contracting Powers is attacked by a Power at present not involved in the European War or in the Japanese-Chinese conflict.

ARTICLE 4. With a view to implementing the present pact, joint technical commissions, to be appointed by the respective Governments of Japan, Germany and Italy, will meet without delay.

ARTICLE 5. Japan, Germany and Italy affirm that the above agreement affects in no way the political status existing at present between each of the three Contracting Powers and Soviet Russia.

ARTICLE 6. The present pact shall become valid immediately upon signature and shall remain in force ten years from the date on which it becomes effective.
In due time, before the expiration of said term, the High Contracting Parties shall, at the request of any one of them, enter into negotiations for its renewal.

In faith whereof, the undersigned duly authorized by their respective governments have signed this pact and have affixed hereto their signatures.

&lt;small&gt;Done in triplicate at Berlin, the 27th day of September, 1940, in the 19th year of the fascist era, corresponding to the 27th day of the ninth month of the 15th year of Showa (the reign of Emperor Hirohito).&lt;/small&gt;}}
&lt;!--The '''Tripartite Treaty''' was immediately named by the Italian press ''Roberto'' based on the first syllables of [[Rome]], [[Berlin]] and [[Tokyo]].--&gt;

==Background==
{{further|Germany–Japan relations}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L09218, Berlin, Japanische Botschaft.jpg|thumb|The Japanese embassy in Berlin clad in the flags of the three signatories of the Tripartite Pact in September 1940.]]
Although Germany and Japan technically became allies with the signing of [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] of 1936, the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] between Germany and the Soviet Union came as a surprise to Japan. In November 1939, Germany and Japan signed the "Agreement for Cultural Cooperation between Japan and Germany", which restored the "reluctant alliance" between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol55/iss4/22 |title=Reluctant Allies: German–Japanese Naval Relations in World War II (book review) |first=Holger H. |last=Herwig |journal=Naval War College Review |format=PDF |volume=55 |issue=4 |year=2002 |access-date=2018-09-25 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later signatories==
In a ceremonial speech following the signing of the pact on 27 September, Ribbentrop may have suggested that the signatories were open to accepting new signatories in the future. The ''[[Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' (DAZ) reported his words as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The purpose of the Pact is, above all things, to help restore peace to the world as quickly as possible. Therefore any other State which wishes to accede to this bloc (''der diesem Block beitreten will''), with the intention of contributing to the restoration of peaceful conditions, will be sincerely and gratefully made welcome and will participate in the economic and political reorganisation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The official ''[[Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro]]'' (DNB), however, as well as most of the press, reported a slightly different version, in which the words "having good will towards the pact" (''der diesem Pakt wohlwollend gegenübertreten will''&lt;ref&gt;http://epa.oszk.hu/01500/01536/00013/pdf/UJ_1984_1985_075-115.pdf footnote on page 90&lt;/ref&gt;) instead of "accede to" were used. It is likely that initially it was not envisaged that other nations would join the treaty, and that Ribbentrop misspoke. The official record in the DNB therefore corrected his words to remove any reference to "accession" by other states, but produced an awkward wording in the process.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439–42}}

The Italian foreign minister, Ciano, was resolutely opposed to the idea of adding smaller states to the pact as late as 20 November 1940, arguing in his diary that they weakened the pact and were useless bits of diplomacy.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439–42}}

===Hungary===
The [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] was the fourth state to sign the pact and the first to join it after 27 September 1940. The Hungarian ambassador in Berlin, [[Döme Sztójay]], telegraphed his foreign minister, [[István Csáky]], immediately after news of the signing and of Ribbentrop's speech had reached him. He urged Csáky to join the pact, even claiming that it was the expectation of Germany and Italy that he would do so. He considered it especially important that Hungary sign the pact before Romania did. In response, Csáky asked Sztójay and the ambassador in Rome, [[Frigyes Villani]], to make enquiries regarding Hungary's accession and its potential obligations under the pact. On 28 September, the German secretary of state for foreign affairs, [[Ernst von Weizsäcker]], informed Hungary that Ribbentrop had meant not a "formal accession" but merely "an attitude in the spirit of the Pact". The Italian answer was similar. Nonetheless, within the week the Hungarian government had sent out formal notice of its "spiritual adherence" to the pact.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439–42}}

In the week after Hungary's "spiritual adherence", the Balkan situation changed. Germany granted a Romanian request to send troops to guard the [[Ploiești]] oil fields, and Hungary granted a German request to allow its troops to transit Hungary to get to Romania. On 7 October 1940, the first German troops arrived in Ploiești. It is probable that Romania's accession to the pact had been delayed until the German troops were in place, lest the Soviets take preemptive action to secure the oil fields for themselves. In turn, Hungary's accession had been delayed until Romania's had been negotiated. On 9 October or thereabouts, Weizsäcker delivered a message from Ribbentrop to Sztójay informing him that Hitler now wanted "friendly states" to join the pact. In a telephone conversation with Ciano on 9 or 10 October, Ribbentrop claimed that Hungary had sent a second request to join the pact. Mussolini reluctantly consented. On 12 October, Ribbentrop informed Sztójay that both Italy and Japan had consented to Hungary's accession. Since the Hungarian regent, [[Miklós Horthy]], had specifically instructed Sztójay to ask that Hungary be the first new state to accede to the pact, Ribbentrop granted the request.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439–42}}

===Romania===
The [[Kingdom of Romania]] had joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers in World War I]] and had received [[Transylvania]] from Austria–Hungary. After Germany and Italy [[Second Vienna Award|awarded parts of Transylvania back to Hungary]] and [[Southern Dobruja]] back to Bulgaria and after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|had taken Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]], the [[Fascist]] [[Iron Guard]] party came to power and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact on November 23, 1940.  This was due to the Romanian desire for protection against the Soviet Union.

In Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]]'s affidavit read out at the [[IG Farben Trial]] (1947–48), he stated that the agreement on entering the pact had been concluded before his visit to Berlin on 22 November 1940.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|p=441, n. 3}}

On 14 March 1939, the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]] was declared in the midst of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|dismemberment of Czechoslovakia]]. Hitler invited Monsignor [[Jozef Tiso]] to be the new nation's leader. Soon after it was formed, Slovakia was involved in a [[Slovak-Hungarian War|war with neighboring Hungary]]. Although Slovakia had signed a "Protection Treaty" with Nazi Germany, Germany refused to intervene. The war resulted in territorial gains by Hungary at Slovakia's expense. Even so, Slovakia supported the German [[Slovak invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]] in 1939.

Shortly after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, following the Hungarian lead, Slovakia sent messages of "spiritual adherence" to Germany and Italy.{{sfn|Macartney|1956|pp=439–42}}

On 24 November 1940, the day after Romania signed the pact, the Slovak prime minister and foreign minister, [[Vojtech Tuka]], went to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop. There, he signed Slovakia's accession to the Tripartite Pact. The purpose of this was to increase Tuka's standing in Slovakia relative to that of his rival, Tiso, although the Germans had no intention of permitting Tiso to be removed.{{sfn|Jelínek|1971|p=255}}

===Bulgaria===
[[File:Protokol-1.03.1941.jpg|thumb|upright|Official protocol of Bulgaria's accession into the Tripartite Pact.]]
The [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] had been an ally of Germany and on the losing side in World War I. From the beginning, the Germans pressured Bulgaria to join the Tripartite Pact. On 17 November 1940, Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] and Foreign Minister {{ill|Ivan Popov (diplomat)|lt=Ivan Popov|bg|Иван Попов (дипломат)}} met with Adolf Hitler in Germany. According to [[Hermann Neubacher]], Germany's special envoy to the Balkans, Bulgaria's relation to the Axis powers was completely settled at this meeting. On 23 November, however, the Bulgarian ambassador in Berlin, Peter Draganov, informed the Germans that while Bulgaria had agreed in principle to join the pact, it wished to delay its signing for the time being.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=33}}

The meeting with Hitler precipitated a visit to Bulgaria by the Soviet diplomat [[Arkady Sobolev]] on 25 November. He encouraged the Bulgarians to sign a mutual assistance pact that had first been discussed in October 1939. He offered Soviet recognition of Bulgarian claims in Greece and Turkey. The Bulgarian government, however, was disturbed by the subversive actions of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] in response to these talks, apparently at Soviet urging.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=34}}

On 26 December 1940, the far-right politician [[Alexander Tsankov]] introduced a motion in the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National Assembly]] urging the government to immediately accede to the Tripartite Pact. It was voted down.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=38}}

Bulgaria's hand was finally forced by Germany's desire to intervene in the [[Italo-Greek War]]. This would require moving troops through Bulgaria. With no possibility of resisting Germany militarily, Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]] signed Bulgaria's accession to the pact in Vienna on 1 March 1941. He announced that this was done partly in gratitude for Germany's assistance to Bulgaria in obtaining the [[Treaty of Craiova]] with Romania, and that it would not affect Bulgaria's relations with Turkey or the Soviet Union. Later that day, Ribbentrop promised Filov that after the fall of Greece, Bulgaria would obtain an [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coastline between the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] and [[Maritsa]] rivers.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=45}}

According to Article 17 of the [[Tarnovo Constitution]], treaties had to be ratified by the National Assembly. In the case of the Tripartite Pact, the government sought to have the treaty ratified without debate or discussion. Seventeen opposition deputies submitted an [[Interpellation (politics)|interpellation]] and one, Ivan Petrov, asked why the Assembly had not been consulted in advance and whether the pact involved Bulgaria in war. They were ignored. The pact was ratified by a vote of 140 to 20.{{sfn|Miller|1975|p=45}}

===Yugoslavia===
{{main|Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact}}
On 25 March 1941 in Vienna, [[Dragiša Cvetković]], Prime Minister of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], signed the Tripartite Pact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sotirović|first=Vladislav B.|date=18 December 2011|title=Кнез Павле Карађорђевић и приступање Југославије Тројном пакту|publisher=NSPM|url=http://www.nspm.rs/istina-i-pomirenje-na-ex-yu-prostorima/knez-pavle-karadjordjevic-i-pristupanje-jugoslavije-trojnom-paktu.html|language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 March, the regime was overthrown in [[Yugoslav coup d'état|a military ''coup d'état'']] with British support. Seventeen-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under Prime Minister and General [[Dušan Simović]], refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, and started negotiations with [[Great Britain]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The enraged Hitler issued [[List of Adolf Hitler's directives|Directive 25]] as an answer to the coup, and then simultaneously attacked Yugoslavia and [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] starting on 6 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tomasevich | first=Jozo | year=1975 | title=War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941–1945: The Chetniks | publisher=Stanford University Press | location=Palo Alto, CA | isbn=978-0-8047-0857-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yoCaAAAAIAAJ | page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Air Force]] [[Operation Retribution (1941)|bombed Belgrade]] for three days and nights.

===Croatia===
The [[Independent State of Croatia]] (''Nezavisna Država Hrvatska'', or NDH) signed the Tripartite Pact on 15 June 1941.{{sfn|Kolanović|2006|p=473}}

==Potential signatories==

===Soviet Union===
{{main|German–Soviet Axis talks}}
Just prior to the formation of the Tripartite Pact, the Soviet Union was informed of its existence, and the potential of its joining.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=199–202}} [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] was thus sent to Berlin to discuss the pact and the possibility of the Soviet Union joining it.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=199–202}} The Soviets considered joining the Tripartite Pact to be an update of existing agreements with Germany.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=199–202}} During the visit to Berlin, Molotov agreed in principle to the Soviet Union joining the pact so long as some details, such as Soviet annexation of Finland, could be worked out.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=199–202}} The [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] sent a revised version of the pact to Germany on 25 November.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=199–202}}  To demonstrate the benefits of partnership, the Soviet Union made large economic offerings to Germany.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=199–202}}

However, the Germans had no intention of allowing the Soviets to join the pact.  They were already making preparations for their [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] and were committed to doing so regardless of any action the Soviets took.
{{quote|Political conversations designed to clarify the attitude of Russia in the immediate future have been started.  Regardless of the outcome of these conversations, all preparations for the East previously ordered orally are to be continued.  [Written] directives on that will follow as soon as the basic elements of the army's plan for the operation have been submitted to me and approved by me.  —Adolf Hitler{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=199–202}}}}
When they received the Soviet proposal in November, they simply did not reply.  They did, however, accept the new economic offerings, and signed an agreement for such on 10 January 1941.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=199–202}}

===Finland===
{{Further|Military history of Finland during World War II}}
Military co-operation between Finland and Nazi Germany started in late 1940 after Finland had lost a significant amount of her territory to Soviet aggression in the [[Winter War]]. Finland joined [[Operation Barbarossa]] on 25 June 1941, starting the [[Continuation War]]. In November, Finland signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] (an anti-communist agreement directed against the Soviet Union) with many other countries allied with Germany. Soon after this Germany suggested Finland sign the Tripartite Pact. However, the Finnish government refused, because Finland saw its war as a "separate war" from the Second World War, and it saw its objectives as different from those of Nazi Germany. Finland also wanted to maintain diplomatic relations with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], the United States in particular. During the Second World War, Germany asked Finland several times to sign the pact, but always the Finnish government declined the offer. Diplomatic relations between Finland and the United States were maintained until June 1944, although the US ambassador had already been recalled earlier. The United Kingdom, however, declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941 in support of its ally, the Soviet Union.

At the request of the German command, the Finns established a winter warfare school in [[Kankaanpää]]. It began its first two-month course for German officers and NCOs in December 1941. In the summer of 1942, the German-speaking Finnish instructors taught a course on forest warfare. General [[Waldemar Erfurth]], the German liaison to the Finnish general headquarters, considered the school an outstanding success. It was also attended by some Hungarian officers.{{sfn|DiNardo|1996|p=713}}

===Thailand===
{{Further|Thailand in World War II}}
[[File:Thai-German in Berlin 1943.png|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Luang Wichitwathakan]] (centre, standing) and German diplomats, 1943]]
[[Japanese invasion of Thailand|Japan attacked Thailand]] at 02:00 local time on 8 December 1941. The Japanese ambassador, Teiji Tsubokami, told the Thai foreign minister, [[Direk Jayanama]], that Japan only wanted permission for its troops to pass through Thailand to attack the British in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[British Burma|Burma]]. At 07:00, Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (Phibun) held an emergency cabinet meeting in [[Bangkok]] and soon after a ceasefire was ordered. Phibun then met with Tsubokami, who offered him four options: to conclude a defensive–offensive alliance with Japan, to join the Tripartite Pact, to cooperate in Japanese military operations, or to agree to the joint defence of Thailand. Military cooperation was chosen, the Tripartite Pact rejected.{{sfn|Chinvanno|1992|p=13}}

According to the post-war memoires of Direk Jayanama, Phibun planned to later sign the pact, but Direk's opposition prevented this.{{sfn|Flood|1970|p=989}}

==Tripartite relations, 1940–1943==
[[File:1941 Chinese War Declaration vs Germany and Italy.jpg|thumb|upright|China's declaration of war against Germany and Italy (9 December 1941) was made on the grounds that the Tripartite Pact banded the allies together "into a block of aggressor states working closely together to carry out their common program of world conquest and domination".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jvl.leverage.it/china-s-declaration-of-war-against-japan-germany-and-italy-december-1941 China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy] at the Jewish Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The "joint technical commissions" required by the pact were established by an agreement of 20 December 1940. They were to consist of a general commission in each capital, consisting of the host foreign minister and the other two partners' ambassadors. Under the general commission were to be military and economic commissions. On 15 December 1941 the first meeting of all three commissions in one capital, Berlin, took place, labelled a "Tripartite Pact Conference". It was decided there to form a "Permanent Council of the Tripartite Pact Powers", but nothing happened for two months. Only the Italians, whom the Japanese mistrusted, pushed for greater collaboration.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}

On 18 January 1942, the German and Italian governments signed two secret operational agreements, one with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and another with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. These agreements divided the world along longitude 70° east into two major operational zones, but it had almost no military significance. Chiefly, it committed the powers to cooperation in matters of commerce, intelligence and communication.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}

On 24 February 1942 the Permanent Council met under the chairmanship of Ribbentrop, who announced that "the propaganda effect is one of the main reasons for our meetings". The representatives set up a propaganda commission and then adjourned indefinitely. The military commission in Berlin met only two or three times by 1943, and there were no trilateral naval talks at all. Germany and Japan conducted separate naval discussions, and Italy consulted the Japanese independently for its planned [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|assault on Malta]] in 1942.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}

The economic relationship between the Tripartite powers was fraught with difficulty. Japan would not grant economic concessions to Germany in 1941, lest they ruin [[Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor|its negotiations with the United States]]. In January 1942 negotiations on economic cooperation began, but an agreement was not signed until 20 January 1943 in Berlin. Italy was invited to sign a similar agreement in Rome at the same time, for propaganda purposes, but none of the supplementary Berlin protocols applied to Italo-Japanese relations.{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}

=="No separate peace" agreement==
Japan first pressed Germany to join the war with the United States on 2 December 1941, only two days after notifying Berlin of its intention to go to war. Receiving no response, Japan approached Italy. At 04:00 on the morning of 5 December, Ribbentrop gave the Japanese ambassador a proposal—which had already been approved by Italy—to join the war and prosecute it jointly. On 11 December 1941, the same day as the [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|German declaration of war against the United States]] and the [[Italian declaration of war on the United States|Italian declaration]], the three powers signed an agreement—already hammered out on 8 December—barring any separate peace with the United States or Britain. It was "intended as a propaganda accompaniment to the declaration of war".{{sfn|Boog|Rahn|Stumpf|Wegner|2001}}
{{quote|

== Chronology ==
Prior to the December 2010 subpoena relating to the WikiLeaks, Twitter had received at least one subpoena for information about its users. Just after the Attorney-General of the US state of Pennsylvania [[Tom Corbett]] was [[Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2010|elected as governor of Pennsylvania]], it was revealed that he had issued a subpoena against Twitter to demand personal information on two users who criticised him. The sub-poena included phone numbers, email addresses, banking info, and internet accounts. It also ordered Twitter to produce the information without informing the users.&lt;ref name="philly_corbett"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Staff writer]]| title=Corbett Subpoenas Twitter for Critics' Names | date=20 May 2010 | work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/our-money/Corbett_subpoenas_Twitter_for_critics_names.html |accessdate=12 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfac4IAo |archivedate=11 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' claimed that the subpoena was issued because of the two users' criticisms of Corbett.&lt;ref name="philly_corbett" /&gt; Corbett's spokesperson said that the subpoena was issued as "part of an ongoing criminal investigation".&lt;ref name="philly_corbett" /&gt; The organizations [[Public Citizen]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) provided legal aid to the users.&lt;ref name="corbett_tw_subpoena_fails"&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Kravets |title=Pennsylvania AG Dropping Twitter Subpoena | date=21 May 2010 | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/05/twitter-subpoena-2/ |accessdate=12 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfaJKgBE |archivedate=11 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subpoena was later dropped by the Attorney-General's office.&lt;ref name="corbett_tw_subpoena_fails" /&gt; On 11 March, a U.S. judge upheld the request of the federal prosecutor.&lt;ref name=reutersupheld&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeremy Pelofsky|title=U.S. judge backs request for Assange friends' records|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/03/11/idINIndia-55515920110311|accessdate=9 April 2011|newspaper=Reuters|date=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subpoena issued with accompanying gag order ===
On 14 December 2010 the U.S. Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information in accordance with USC 18 2703(d). The order additionally directed that Twitter should not disclose the existence of the subpoena without prior authorization. Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning, [[Rop Gonggrijp]], [[Jacob Appelbaum]] and [[Birgitta Jonsdottir]] were named in the subpoena. The requested information included their user names, addresses, telephone numbers, bank account details, and credit card numbers.&lt;ref name="subpoena_pdf" /&gt;

Assange's lawyer [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]] argued that&lt;ref name="zdnet_subp_affects_you"&gt;{{cite news | first=Zack | last=Whittaker | title=US Subpoenas Wikileaks Tweets, and Why This Could Affect You | date=8 January 2011 | publisher=[[ZDNet]] | url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/us-subpoenas-wikileaks-tweets-and-why-this-could-affect-you/7610 |accessdate=12 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfkLf0Ru |archivedate=11 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; since the application also extended to destination email addresses and IP addresses for any communication stored for the named accounts, personal identifying information was to be collected for some six hundred and thirty-four thousand followers of WikiLeaks's Twitter feed.&lt;ref name="bloomberg_subpoena"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-10/u-s-twitter-subpoena-on-wikileaks-is-harassment-lawyer-says.html |title=US Twitter Subpoena on WikiLeaks is Harassment, Lawyer Says |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |author=Larson, Erik |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="subpoena_pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/01/07/twitter/subpoena.pdf |format=PDF |title=Twitter Subpoena |work=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |accessdate=10 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfUQlMUS |archivedate=11 January 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smh_tw_subpoena" /&gt;

WikiLeaks alleged it had evidence suggesting similar subpoenas had been issued to [[Google]] and [[Facebook]],&lt;ref name="torontostar_spillspublic"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Yost, Pete |author2=Satter, Raphael G. | title=WikiLeaks Subpoenas Spill Out into Public Realm | date=8 January 2011 | publisher=''[[Associated Press]]'' (via ''[[Toronto Star]]'') | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/918606--wikileaks-subpoenas-spill-out-into-public-realm |accessdate=12 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfW25lha |archivedate=11 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lawyer Mark Stephens said that similar information had been sought not only from Google and Facebook but also from [[eBay]]'s [[Skype]] unit.&lt;ref name="bloomberg_subpoena" /&gt; WikiLeaks called for Google and Facebook to unseal the subpoenas if they had received them,&lt;ref name="torontostar_spillspublic" /&gt; but no spokespeople were available to comment.&lt;ref name="bloomberg_subpoena" /&gt;

=== Appeal and publication of the subpoena ===
Twitter applied to notify its users of the issue of the subpoena.&lt;ref name="wsj_twitterappeals"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704482704576072081788251562 |title=U.S. Asks Twitter for WikiLeaks Data |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |author=Sonne, Paul |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenwald_subpoena"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/01/07/twitter |author=[[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]] |title=DOJ Subpoenas Twitter Records of Several WikiLeaks Volunteers |work=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |accessdate=10 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfVUxx8j |archivedate=11 January 2011 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/08/us-twitter-hand-icelandic-wikileaks-messages |title=WikiLeaks Demands Google and Facebook Unseal US Subpoenas |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Beaumont, Peter |date=8 January 2011 |accessdate=10 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 January 2011 it was notified of the success in its appeal,&lt;ref name="gonggrijp_unsealing_pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rop.gonggri.jp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Twitter_Unsealing_Order.pdf |format=PDF |title=Twitter Unsealing Order |publisher=[[Rop Gonggrijp]] |accessdate=11 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfUjT39u | archivedate=11 January 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the company to inform its users and to give them ten days in turn in which to appeal.&lt;ref name="greenwald_subpoena" /&gt; After Twitter informed Jonsdottir, she released a tweet stating "USA government wants to know about all my tweets and more since november 1st 2009. Do they realize I am a member of parliament in Iceland?"&lt;ref name="guardian_iceland_reacts" /&gt;

Aden Fine of the ACLU said that "Twitter's e-mail indicated that it had not yet turned over to the U.S. government any records that prosecutors requested."&lt;ref name="reuters_wl_quash" /&gt;

=== Users' opposition to the subpoena ===
Among those specifically named by the subpoena, Assange, Jonsdottir, Appelbaum&lt;ref name="smh_tw_subpoena" /&gt; and Gonggrijp&lt;ref name="reuters_wl_quash"&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Hosenball | title=WikiLeaks Activists May Seek To Quash Demand for Docs | date=11 January 2011 | work=[[Reuters]] | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70A5ZT20110111 |accessdate=12 January 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfiyscBG |archivedate=11 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; all stated that they would oppose it. Lawyer Aden Fine of the ACLU participated in defending those subpoenaed.&lt;ref name="reuters_wl_quash" /&gt; Jonsdottir stated that she had contacted the [[Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (Iceland)|Icelandic Minister of Justice and Human Rights]] and commented that the "U.S. government is trying to criminalize [[whistleblowing]] and publication of whistleblowing material."&lt;ref name="reuters_wl_quash" /&gt;

== Subsequent reactions ==
''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the US government issues over fifty thousand such requests for information each year, typically accompanied by the so-called gag order,&lt;ref name="NYT NM"&gt;{{Registration required|date=January 2011}} {{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/business/media/10link.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |title=Twitter Shines a Spotlight on Secret F.B.I. Subpoenas |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Cohen, Noam |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; linking the case to how "1986 Privacy Law is Outrun by the Web".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/technology/10privacy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |title=1986 Privacy Law is Outrun by the Web |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=13 January 2011 |first1=Miguel |last1=Helft |date=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Merrill]], the first to file a constitutional challenge against the use of national security letters, describes this as "a perfect example of how the government can use its broad powers to silence people".&lt;ref name="NYT NM" /&gt; Lawmakers in Iceland criticised the subpoena as an instance of overreach.&lt;ref name="dw_iceland_reacts"&gt;{{cite web |author= Connor, Richard|date=9 January 2011|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14758284,00.html |title=Iceland Blasts US Demand for Lawmaker's Details in WikiLeaks Probe |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian_iceland_reacts"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/08/us-twitter-hand-icelandic-wikileaks-messages |title=Icelandic MP Fights US Demand for Her Twitter Account Details — Birgitta Jonsdottir Brands Efforts by US Justice Department To Access Her Private Information 'Completely Unacceptable' |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Rushe, Dominic |date=8 January 2011 |accessdate=10 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7edd3e2a-1b52-11e0-868c-00144feab49a.html#axzz1AdqdyPId |title=Iceland Protests over US Probe of Lawmaker |work=[[The Financial Times]] |author=Menn, Joseph|date=8 January 2011 |accessdate=10 January 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange's lawyer, [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]], has interpreted the subpoena as a sign that US authorities were desperate to develop a criminal case against Assange. He stated that the subpoena was an attempt to "shake the electronic tree in the hope some kind of criminal charge drops out the bottom of it."&lt;ref name="torontostar_spillspublic" /&gt;

[[Juan Cole]], a historian of the modern [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]], described the subpoena as "a [[fishing expedition]] and legally fishy in that regard" that "is being pursued by the Obama administration out of terror that further massive leaks will be made public."&lt;ref name="juancole_tw_subpoena"&gt;{{cite web| last =Cole| first =Juan| authorlink =Juan Cole| title =DOJ Subpoenas Twitter Account of Wikileaks Volunteer and Now Iceland MP| work =| publisher =[[Juan Cole]]| date =8 January 2011| url =http://www.juancole.com/2011/01/doj-subpoenas-twitter-account-of-wikileaks-volunteer-and-now-iceland-mp.html  |accessdate =12 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfcfKKYI |archivedate=11 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted the legal action against people associated with WikiLeaks with the lack of legal actions against "Bush administration officials, such as Dick Cheney, who ordered people tortured [and] have not been in any way inconvenienced by Mssrs. Obama and Holder."&lt;ref name="juancole_tw_subpoena" /&gt; Cole suggested that users of [[social media]] should shift from Facebook and Twitter that have "internet monopolies" and "are in turn tools of US government control" to social media based in Europe or the [[Global South]]. WikiLeaks's list of 637,000 followers on Twitter dropped by 3,000 in the hours following the announcement of the US Department of Justice action.&lt;ref name="smh_tw_subpoena"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Staff writer]]|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/us-turns-to-twitter-as-wikileaks-chase-continues-20110109-19jy5.html |title=US Turns to Twitter as WikiLeaks Chase Continues |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=11 January 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfhryW49 |archivedate=11 January 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of Law [[Ben Saul]] argued that the US had been compelled to attempt to obtain information on citizens of other countries through action against its own companies due to its lack of overseas law enforcement powers, suggesting that "the real question is how will other countries react … will other governments try to do things to shut down this kind of investigation?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sherington, Greg|date=11 January 2011|url=http://sydney.edu.au/news/law/436.html?newscategoryid=67&amp;newsstoryid=6261 |title=US Subpoena of Iceland Twitter Accounts |publisher=[[Sydney Law School]] |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the European Parliament from the Netherlands, Romania and the UK have questioned whether US 'snooping' on the Twitter accounts of those linked with WikiLeaks is in violation of European privacy laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12191486 |title=Anonymous urges global protests |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 January 2011 |date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alde.eu/press/press-and-release-news/press-release/article/alde-calls-on-commission-to-clarify-issue-of-us-government-wikileaks-subpoenas-36732/ |title=ALDE Calls on Commission to clarify issue of US Government Wikileaks subpoenas |publisher=[[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] |accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] has since, comparing their law enforcement policies, stressed "how important it is that [[social media]] companies do what they can to protect the sensitive data they hold from the prying eyes of the government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/social-media-and-law-enforcement-who-gets-what |title=Social Media and Law Enforcement: Who Gets What Data and When? |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' [[Wired News|Wired]]'' staff writer Ryan Singel said that Twitter's "action in asking for the gag order to be overturned sets a new precedent that we can only hope that other companies begin to follow" and summarised his point of view by saying "Twitter [[Software release life cycle|beta-tested]] a spine" and that Twitter's response should become an "industry standard".&lt;ref name="wired_twitter_rulez"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2011/01/twitter-2/ |title=Twitter's Response to WikiLeaks Subpoena Should Be the Industry Standard |author=Singel, Ryan |work=[[Wired News|Wired]] |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=11 January 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vfhxlrys |archivedate=11 January 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
