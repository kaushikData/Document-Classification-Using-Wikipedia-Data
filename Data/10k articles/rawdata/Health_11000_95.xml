'''Anatomography''' is an interactive website which supports generating anatomical diagrams and animations of the [[human body]]. The Anatomography website is maintained by the DBCLS (Database Center for Life Science) non-profit research institute located at the [[University of Tokyo]]. Anatomical diagrams generated by Anatomography, and 3D polygon data used on the website (called BodyParts3D), are freely available under the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license]].&lt;ref name="CREDIT"/&gt;

==Description==
Anatomography was launched on Feb. 9, 2009&lt;ref name="LAUNCH"&gt;[http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/info/userGuide/releaseNotes/index.html Release notes] (in Japanese).  DBCLS. Retrieved 2012-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; by founder and chief director Kousaku Okubo ([[:ja:大久保公策|大久保 公策]]), professor of the [[DNA Data Bank of Japan]] at the [[National Institute of Genetics]].

Human body polygon data used in the site are called "'''BodyParts3D'''".&lt;ref name="PMID18835852"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18835852|pmc=2686534|year=2009|last1=Mitsuhashi|first1=N|last2=Fujieda|first2=K|last3=Tamura|first3=T|last4=Kawamoto|first4=S|last5=Takagi|first5=T|last6=Okubo|first6=K|title=BodyParts3D: 3D structure database for anatomical concepts|volume=37|issue=Database issue|pages=D782–5|doi=10.1093/nar/gkn613|journal=Nucleic Acids Research}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; BodyParts3D polygon data are extracted from full-body [[MRI]] images. The MRI image set that BodyParts3D is based on is called "TARO". [[Taro (given name)|Taro]] is a common given name for males in Japanese, as [[John (given name)|John]] is in English. TARO is a 2mm * 2mm * 2mm [[voxel]] dataset of the human male created by the [[National Institute of Information and Communications Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=14971769|year=2004|last1=Nagaoka|first1=T|last2=Watanabe|first2=S|last3=Sakurai|first3=K|last4=Kunieda|first4=E|last5=Watanabe|first5=S|last6=Taki|first6=M|last7=Yamanaka|first7=Y|title=Development of realistic high-resolution whole-body voxel models of Japanese adult males and females of average height and weight, and application of models to radio-frequency electromagnetic-field dosimetry|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–15|journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology|doi=10.1088/0031-9155/49/1/001}}&lt;/ref&gt; TARO was published freely on November, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0411/10/news106.html 日本人の数値人体モデルDB「TARO」と「HANAKO」公開 2004/11/10] (in Japanese).

The construction process of BodyParts3D is as follows.&lt;ref name="PMID18835852"/&gt;
*Phase 1: Additional anatomical segmentations were introduced in the original TARO data. 
*Phase 2: Then, missing details were supplemented and blurred contours were clarified using a 3D editing program by referring to textbooks, atlases,&lt;ref name="RELEASE3.0"&gt;[ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/bodyparts3d/LATEST/release_3.0_e.html BodyParts3D Release Note (Release 3.0, 2011/6/20)] DBCLS. Retrieved 2012-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and mock-up models by medical illustrators. 
*Phase 3: Further segmentation and data modification will continue in collaboration with clinical researchers until sufficient concept coverage is achieved.

BodyParts3D polygon data are distributed in the [[Wavefront .obj file|OBJ]] file format. The entire data file's size is 127 [[Megabyte|MB]] (polygon reduced) and 521 MB (high quality) as of version 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbarchive.biosciencedbc.jp/en/bodyparts3d/download.html Download - BodyParts3D] DBCLS.

==Technical features==
BodyParts3D/Anatomography project uses the [[Foundational Model of Anatomy]] (FMA). The FMA is an open-source anatomical [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] developed and maintained by the Structural Informatics Group at the [[University of Washington]]. In BodyParts3D, each body-part is managed by an FMA identifier (FMAID) defined by the FMA. For example, the [[vertebral column]] is registered as ''[https://archive.is/20130218184836/http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/ag_annotation.cgi?i=FMA13478&amp;lng=en&amp;t=Conventional&amp;position=rotate FMA13478]'', the [[temporal lobe]] is registered as ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100116/http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/ag_annotation.cgi?i=FMA61825&amp;lng=en&amp;t=Conventional&amp;position=rotate FMA61825]'', and so on.

'''Atypical pulmonary carcinoid tumour''' is a subtype of [[pulmonary carcinoid tumor]]. It is an uncommon low-grade malignant lung mass that is most often in the central airways of the lung. It is also known as "atypical lung carcinoid tumour", " atypical lung carcinoid" or "moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma".

It is a more aggressive than typical carcinoid tumors: nodal metastases in 70% vs. 5%. The 5 year survival is 49-69%.

Atypical carcinoid tumors have increased mitotic activity (2-10 per 10 [[high power field|HPF]]), nuclear pleomorphism or foci of necrosis.

== Morphological differential diagnosis ==
* [[Typical pulmonary carcinoid tumor]]
** Typical pulmonary carcinoid lacks comedo-like necrosis, and has &lt; 0.2 mitotic figures/HPF.

==Background==
The Mukherjee Committee in 1966 prescribed a system of targets and incentives and identified ANMs and other village-level workers as agents for the popularization of the health programmes. In the 1950s and 1960s, training of ANMs mainly focused on [[midwifery]] and mother and child health. 

In 1973, the Kartar Singh Committee of the [[Government of India]] combined the functions of the health services and changed the role of ANMs.&lt;ref name="tnaionline1"/&gt; The committee recommended that there should be 1 ANM available per 10,000-12,000 people.&lt;ref name="Goel2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=S.L. Goel|title=Rural Health Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRyoqesyB_YC&amp;pg=PA9|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|isbn=978-81-8450-115-5|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the Srivastava Committee recommended expansion in the role of ANM. Recommended expansion included the role of an ANM as a multipurpose health worker. Along with maternity care, the committee recommended that the ANM's work include child health (immunization) and primary curative care of villagers. The [[Indian Nursing Council]] (INC) accepted the recommendations of the committee and included them in the syllabus in 1977. This decision also reduced the training period of the ANM from 24 months to 18 months.&lt;ref name="tnaionline1"/&gt;

In 1986, the National Education Policy gave the ANM programme a status of Vocational Education. Following this decision, the INC again reviewed its policy and recommended that the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] make the ANM course vocational at +2 level (after 10th class/higher secondary level). However, only a few states of India have made the ANM course a vocational course at the higher secondary level of schooling.&lt;ref name="tnaionline1"/&gt; According to the latest guidelines by INC, the minimum age for admission to an ANM course should be 17 years while the maximum age limit is 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiannursingcouncil.org/nursing-programs.asp?show=elig-crit |title=Indian Nursing Council, Official indian nursing council website, Government India, Establish Uniforms Standards, Training Nurses, Midwives, Health Visitors |publisher=Indiannursingcouncil.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[National Rural Health Mission]] (NRHM) was launched, which focused on improvising primary health care in villages and further increased the importance of the ANM as a link between health services and the community.&lt;ref name="tnaionline1"/&gt;

==Role of the ANM==
ANMs works at health sub-centres. The sub-centre is a small village-level institution that provides primary health care to the community. The sub-centre works under the [[Primary Health Centre (India)|Primary Health Centre]] (PHC). Each PHC usually has around six such sub-centres. Before the launch of the NRHM in 2005, there was provision of one ANM per sub-centre. Later it was found that one ANM was not adequate to fulfill the health care requirements of a village. In 2005 NRHM made provision of two ANMs (one permanent and one contractual) for each sub-centre. The ANM is usually selected from the local village to increase accountability. 

As per the Rural Health Statistics Bulletin of 2010, there were 147,069 sub-centres functioning in India, which were increased to 152,326 in March 2014. As per recent norms, there should be one sub-centre for population of 5,000 while in tribal and hilly area population allotted for each sub-centre is 3,000.&lt;ref name="tnaionline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nrhm&gt;{{cite web|title=RURAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN INDIA |url=https://nrhm-mis.nic.in/RURAL%20HEALTH%20STATISTICS/(A)%20RHS%20-%202014/Rural%20Health%20Care%20System%20in%20India.pdf |publisher=[[National Rural Health Mission]] |accessdate=7 January 2016 |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) Guidelines for Sub-Centres|url=http://clinicalestablishments.nic.in/WriteReadData/875.pdf|publisher=[[Government of India]]|accessdate=7 January 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IITK&gt;{{cite web|title=HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN RURAL INDIA|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/3inetwork/html/reports/IIR2007/11-Health.pdf|publisher=[[IIT, Kanpur]]|accessdate=7 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080722/http://www.iitk.ac.in/3inetwork/html/reports/IIR2007/11-Health.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under NRHM, each sub-centre gets an untied fund of [[Indian Rupees|Rs]] 10,000 for expenditure. The ANM has a joint bank account with the [[Sarpanch]] (head) of the village to get such funds. ANMs use untied fund for buying items needed for sub-centre, such as blood pressure equipment, weighing machine, scales and for cleaning. The rate of deliveries at the sub-centre level has been increased since the grant of untied funds via NRHM.&lt;ref name="tnaionline1"/&gt;

ANMs are expected to be multi-purpose health workers. ANM-related work includes maternal and child health along with family planning services, health and nutrition education, efforts for maintaining environmental sanitation, immunisation for the control of communicable diseases, treatment of minor injuries, and first aid in emergencies and disasters.&lt;ref name="tnaionline1"/&gt;

In remote areas, such as hilly and tribal areas where transport facility is likely to be poor, ANMs are required to conduct home deliveries for women.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

===Relationship with ASHA===
The [[Accredited Social Health Activist]] (ASHA) is a community health worker. Depending on the area covered by the sub-centre, each ANM is supported by four or five ASHAs. ANMs are supposed to take weekly or fortnightly meeting with ASHAs to review work done the last week or fortnight. ANMs guides ASHAs on aspects of health care. 

With the [[Anganwadi|Anganwadi Worker (AWW)]], the ANM acts as a resource person for the training of ASHAs. The ANM motivates ASHAs to bring beneficiaries to the institution. The ASHA brings pregnant women to the ANM for check-ups. She also brings married couples to the ANM for counseling on the family planning. The ASHA brings children to immunisation sessions held by the ANM. The ASHA act as bridge between the ANM and the village.&lt;ref name="tnaionline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nrhm/&gt;&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5110">The '''Ballard Maturational Assessment''', '''Ballard Score''', or '''Ballard Scale''' is a commonly used technique of [[gestational age]] assessment. It assigns a score to various criteria, the sum of all of which is then extrapolated to the gestational age of the [[fetus]]. These criteria are divided into physical and neurological criteria. This scoring allows for the estimation of age in the range of 26 weeks-44 weeks. The New Ballard Score is an extension of the above to include extremely [[pre-term babies]] i.e. up to 20 weeks.

The scoring relies on the [[intra-uterine]] changes that the fetus undergoes during its maturation. Whereas the neurological criteria depend mainly upon muscle tone, the physical ones rely on anatomical changes. The [[neonate]] (less than 37 weeks of age) is in a state of physiological [[hypotonia]]. This tone increases throughout the fetal growth period, meaning a more [[Premature birth|premature]] baby would have lesser muscle tone.

It was developed in 1979.&lt;ref name="pmid490248"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ballard JL, Novak KK, Driver M |title=A simplified score for assessment of fetal maturation of newly born infants |journal=J. Pediatr. |volume=95 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=769–74 |date=November 1979 |pmid=490248 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-3476(79)80734-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The neuromuscular criteria==
These are:

==Scoring==
Each of the above criteria are scored from 0 through 5, in the original Ballard Score. The scores were then ranged from 5 to 50, with the corresponding gestational ages being 26 weeks and 44 weeks. An increase in the score by 5 increases the age by 2 weeks. The New Ballard Score allows scores of -1 for the criteria, hence making negative scores possible. The possible scores then range from -10 to 50, the gestational range extending up to 20 weeks.
&lt;nowiki&gt;(A simple formula to come directly to the age from the Ballard Score is
Age=((2*score)+120)) / 5&lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1909">A '''boilery''' or '''boiling house''' is a place of [[boiling]], much as a [[bakery]] is a place of baking.  Boilery can also mean the process and equipment for boiling. Although they are now generally confined to factories, and usually boil industrial products rather than food, historically they were more common in daily life. Boileries are typically for boiling large quantities of fluid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-boilery.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th to 19th centuries, boileries were used to convert [[sugarcane]] juice into raw [[sugar]]. These boileries were usually sturdy places, built from stone, and contained several copper kettles, each with a furnace beneath it.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2535107 Photo of Beamish Colliery Boiler House]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sugarcane juice was treated with lime in large clarifying vats, before it was heated in copper kettles over individual furnaces. Due to their importance, many Western sugar plantations had their own boileries on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/boilery |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302042058/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Boilery |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Soap would also be made in a boiling house.  

Another use for a boilery is to make salt through the evaporation of [[brine]] water.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitslovakia.com/saltworks-near-presov Saltworks Boilery in Slovakia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1828-dictionary.com/d/word/boilery |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101013332/http://1828-dictionary.com/d/word/boilery |archivedate=2011-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Construction on the clinic began in 1968, on orders from [[Kim Il-sung]].&lt;ref name="KaganOh1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Kagan|author2=Matthew Oh|author3=David S.

==Patients==

Access to Bonghwa is restricted to members of North Korea's political elite, and the existence of the hospital is secret within North Korea.&lt;ref name="Hunter1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen-Louise Hunter|title=Kim Il-song's North Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrz5OJvCkmIC&amp;pg=PA231|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96296-8|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

==Facilities==

The Clinic has a helipad.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-kim/foreign-doctors-military-guards-bespoke-care-for-north-koreas-kims-idUSKCN0HQ54020141002 |title=Foreign doctors, military guards: Bespoke care for North Korea's Kims |date=October 1, 2014 |first=James |last=Pearson |publisher=[[Reuters]] |editor-first=Tony |editor-last=Munroe |editor-first2=Alex |editor-last2=Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reportedly one of the few hospitals in North Korea capable of performing complex surgeries.&lt;ref name="Lankov2013"&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrei |last=Lankov|title=The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSgG8Y3W5p4C&amp;pg=PT85|date=10 April 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-997584-6|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bowl of Hygieia''' is one of the [[symbol]]s of [[pharmacy]]. [[Hygieia]] was the Greek goddess of Health [[hygiene]], and the associate, wife, or daughter of [[Asclepius]]. Asclepius' symbol is his [[Rod of Asclepius|rod]], with a [[snake]] twined around it; correspondingly, Hygieia's symbol is a [[cup]] or [[chalice]] with a snake twined around its stem and poised above it.

== Usage of symbol by pharmaceutical associations ==
The bowl of Hygieia has been used as a symbol of the pharmacy profession at least as far back as 1796, when it was used on a coin minted for the Parisian Society of Pharmacy.&lt;ref name=DrugTopics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drugtopics/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=116727 |title=History of the Bowl of Hygeia award &amp;#124; Drug Topics |publisher=Drugtopics.modernmedicine.com |date=2002-10-07 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been adopted by many more pharmaceutical associations worldwide, such as the [[American Pharmacists Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyeth.com/aboutwyeth/citizenship/companyawards/bowlofhygeia |title=Bowl of Hygeia Wyeth.com |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2013-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416212749/http://www.wyeth.com/aboutwyeth/citizenship/companyawards/bowlofhygeia |archivedate=April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Canadian Pharmacists Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacists.ca/ |title=Home - CPhA |publisher=Pharmacists.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pharmaceutical Society of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psa.org.au/|title=Pharmaceutical Society of Australia|work=Pharmaceutical Society of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Doctor of pharmacy Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpapharm.org/|title=Doctor of Pharmacy Association -|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conseil de l'Ordre des Pharmaciens'' in France&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordre.pharmacien.fr/Nos-missions/Assurer-la-defense-de-l-honneur-et-de-l-independance/La-protection-de-la-croix-verte-et-du-caducee |title=La protection de la croix verte et du caducée - Nos missions - Ordre National des Pharmaciens |language=fr |publisher=Ordre.pharmacien.fr |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where is written in law with another symbol, the green Greek cross).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006913709&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&amp;dateTexte=20130110&amp;oldAction=rechCodeArticle |title=Code de la santé publique - Article R4235-53 |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance |date=2004-07-29 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bowl of Hygieia is a common symbol on signs outside of pharmacies in Europe.  A [[mortar and pestle]] is a more common symbol in the United States. &lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="Typical pharmacy logos featuring the bowl of Hygieia from different countries"&gt;

== Bowl of Hygeia Award ==
The Bowl of Hygeia Award is an award given by state, provincial, and national pharmacist associations in the United States and Canada to recognize living pharmacists who "possess outstanding records of civic leadership in their communities," while "[encouraging] pharmacists to take active roles in their communities."&lt;ref name="aphafoundation.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphafoundation.org/bowl-hygeia-award-campaign|title=Bowl of Hygeia Award|work=aphafoundation.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018013612/http://www.aphafoundation.org/bowl-hygeia-award-campaign|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was established in 1958 by [[E. Claiborne Robins Sr]],, president of [[A.H. Robins]] of Richmond, Virginia,&lt;ref name="drugtopics.modernmedicine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drug-topics/content/history-bowl-hygeia-award|title=History of the Bowl of Hygeia award|work=Drug Topics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first presented by the Iowa Pharmaceutical Association at its annual convention.&lt;ref name="DrugTopics"/&gt;

In 1961, Robins's Bowl of Hygeia Award program expanded to Canada, and by 1967 it was being given by the pharmacists' associations in all 50 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all 10 Canadian provinces.

In 1989, American Home Products acquired A. H. Robins, and the company's Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division took over sponsorship of the award.&lt;ref name="drugtopics.modernmedicine.com"/&gt; (In 2002 AHP changed its name to [[Wyeth]].)

Wyeth was acquired by [[Pfizer]] in 2009, and in 2010 the company transferred "all rights and responsibilities of the award" to the pharmacy profession as a whole. Today it is managed by the [[American Pharmacists Association]] (APhA), the [[National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations]] (NASPA), and the APhA Foundation.&lt;ref name="aphafoundation.org"/&gt; 

State, provincial, and national pharmacists' associations now each select and sponsor their annual Bowl of Hygeia winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphafoundation.org/bowl-hygeia-award|title=Programs|work=aphafoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of California, San Francisco]] School of Pharmacy, which is one of the nation's top-ranked pharmacy schools according to US News, bestows a Bowl Of Hygeia Award each year to a single graduating student from the School of Pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/pharmacy-rankings|title=Best Pharmacy Programs - Top Pharmacy Schools - US News Best Grad Schools|work=rankingsandreviews.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118182308/http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/pharmacy-rankings|archivedate=2016-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student is selected by his or her classmates along with the faculty members and is selected based on which individual most exemplifies the desirable qualities of a pharmacist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmacy.ucsf.edu/pharmd/students/graduation/hygeia/|title=Bowl of Hygeia Award|work=ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, a controversy erupted when an APhA Foundation-sponsored "Bowl of Hygeia" award was given to Louisiana pharmacist Lloyd Duplantis, who not only was a prominent figure in a movement of pharmacists who refused to dispense the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-drugstore-war/|title=The Drugstore War|date=23 November 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had self-published a book &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pill-Americas-Sacred-Cow/dp/0984116605/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443221124&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=lloyd+duplantis|title=The Pill - America's Sacred Cow: Lloyd Duplantis: 9780984116607: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered full of pseudo-scientific theories, the most notorious being a contention that high-dose estrogen birth control pills lead to an increase in "effeminate men" and homosexuality. The book also theorized that since these type of pills were tested in Haiti during the 1950s, by the 1970s a higher percentage of the population would be homosexual, and that a "unique population transfer" occurred during that time between Haiti and Zaire, where the AIDS virus had been created as a result of "errant vaccine experiments", so that the Haitians then contracted the virus and brought it to the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americablog.com/2015/09/american-pharmacists-association-gives-award-to-homophobic-pseudo-scientist-plugs-his-book.html|title=American Pharmacists Association gives award to homophobic pseudo-scientist, plugs his book|work=AMERICAblog News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite calls for APhA to rescind this award, the organization has stood by its decision.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

'''Cachiros''' or '''Los Cachiros''' is the name of a Honduran criminal organization dedicated to drug trafficking. It was founded in the early 1990s by a group of cattle farmers in the departments of Colón and Olancho de [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="insightcrime1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/honduras-organized-crime-news/cachiros-profile |title=Cachiros Profile |publisher=Insightcrime.org |date=2017-04-07 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the leaders of the Cachiros, Javier Maradiaga, also known as "Javier Cachiro", surrendered to the US government in January 2015. During the trial, Maradiaga pleaded guilty to the charge of [[drug trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/alleged-head-of-honduras-drug-cartel-in-us-custody |title=Alleged Head of Honduras Drug Cartel in US Custody |author=David Gagne |publisher=Insightcrime.org |date=2015-02-03 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Maradiaga's statement, Honduran authorities seized goods valued between 500 and 800 million dollars. The [[net worth]] of the Cachiros is valued at more than one billion dollars.&lt;ref name="insightcrime1"/&gt;

In March 2017, Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga testified at the trial of Fabio Porfirio Lobo in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States District Court]], Southern District of New York. Rivera Maradiaga declared that during the period from 2009 to 2013, the Honduran government assisted him in his drug trafficking operations by providing police intelligence, radar information, and assignment of military personnel to provide security. &lt;ref name="netdna-cdn1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pullzone-tiempo.editorialhondura.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fff.pdf |title=UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v.

Rivera Maradiaga also said his organization paid bribes to prominent members of the Honduran government including former president [[Porfirio Lobo Sosa]]. The bribes were made in order to receive support to their operations and be granted contracts to  companies owned by the Cachiros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Bargent |url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/honduras-narco-testifies-ex-president-took-bribes-from-traffickers |title=Honduras Narco Testifies Ex-President Took Bribes from Traffickers |publisher=Insightcrime.org |date=2017-03-07 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="netdna-cdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noe Leiva |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/honduras-probes-cartel-links-public-contracts-220945644.html |title=Honduras probes cartel links to public contracts |publisher=Yahoo.com |date=2017-03-20 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/honduras-probe-alleged-drug-cartel-links-ex-president-003257368.html |title=Honduras to probe alleged drug cartel links with ex-president |publisher=Sg.news.yahoo.com |date=2017-03-09 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga not only testified but also provided evidence in the form of voice recordings, videos, photographs, etc. &lt;ref name="netdna-cdn1"/&gt;

==Medical cannabis==
In 2017, the administration of President [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] announced a plan to legalize medical cannabis in Peru. The announcement followed a raid in Lima, in which police shut down an operation which produced cannabis medicines for 80 members whose children suffered from epilepsy and other ailments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/peru-government-considering-legalising-medical-marijuanan-pedro-pablo-kuczynski-a7571671.html Peru's government proposes to legalise medical marijuana | The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Peru-Proposes-to-Legalize-Medicinal-Marijuana-20170209-0030.html Peru Proposes to Legalize Medicinal Marijuana | News | teleSUR English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, by a vote of 68 to 5, Peru's congress legalized cannabis oil for medical use.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/medical-marijuana-legal-peru-parliament-politicians-south-america-cannabis-oil-a8012976.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation, established by [[United Parcel Service]] founder [[James E. Casey]] in 1966, has a stated mission "to provide and improve—and ultimately prevent the need for—foster care" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Casey Family Programs|url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/91-0793881/casey-family-programs.aspx|website=GuideStar|publisher=GuideStar USA, Inc.|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Casey Family Programs works primarily in three areas:

* Consulting: technical assistance, data analysis, independent research and strategic consultation provided to child welfare systems, policymakers, courts and tribes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dreher|first1=Arielle|title=Empowering Low-Income Parents|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2015/jul/01/empowering-low-income-parents/|accessdate=6 August 2015|work=Jackson Free Press|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Direct services: foster care and other direct services provided to approximately 1,100 children and families through community-based offices in nine locations. 
* Public policy: child welfare data and other information provided to federal, state, tribal and local governments.

Casey Family Programs has developed a number of tools used by child welfare agencies, including the Ansell Casey Life Skills Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caseylifeskills.org Ansell Casey Life Skills Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1966, the Casey family philanthropy, acting through their [[Annie E. Casey Foundation]] (AECF), started a child welfare agency (foster care and related services) in the [[Seattle, Washington]] area.  When Jim Casey's company, [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS), moved its headquarters from Seattle to [[New York City]] in 1973, Jim Casey gave the Seattle child welfare agency enough funds to become officially a separate, independent entity from the AECF.

'''Contrast-enhanced ultrasound''' ('''CEUS''') is the application of [[ultrasound]] [[contrast medium]] to traditional [[medical ultrasonography|medical sonography]].  Ultrasound contrast agents rely on the different ways in which sound waves are reflected from interfaces between substances. This may be the surface of a small air bubble or a more complex structure. Commercially available contrast media are gas-filled [[microbubbles]] that are administered intravenously to the [[circulatory system|systemic circulation]].  Microbubbles have a high degree of echogenicity (the ability of an object to reflect ultrasound waves).  There is a great difference in echogenicity between the gas in the microbubbles and the soft [[biological tissue|tissue]] surroundings of the body.  Thus, [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonic imaging]] using microbubble contrast agents enhances the ultrasound [[backscatter]], (reflection) of the ultrasound waves, to produce a [[Medical ultrasonography|sonogram]] with increased contrast due to the high echogenicity difference.  Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be used to image blood [[perfusion]] in organs, measure [[blood flow]] rate in the [[heart]] and other organs, and for other applications.

Targeting [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]s that bind to [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] characteristic of [[intravascular]] diseases can be conjugated to [[microbubbles]], enabling the microbubble complex to accumulate selectively in areas of interest, such as [[diseased]] or abnormal tissues.  This form of molecular imaging, known as targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound, will only generate a strong ultrasound signal if targeted microbubbles bind in the area of interest.   Targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound may have many applications in both [[diagnosis|medical diagnostics]] and medical therapeutics.   However, the targeted technique has not yet been approved by the FDA for clinical use in the United States.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is regarded as safe in adults, comparable to the safety of [[MRI contrast agent]]s, and better than [[radiocontrast agent]]s used in [[contrast CT scan]]s. The more limited safety data in children suggests that such use is as safe as in the adult population.&lt;ref name="SidhuCantisani2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sidhu|first1=Paul|last2=Cantisani|first2=Vito|last3=Deganello|first3=Annamaria|last4=Dietrich|first4=Christoph|last5=Duran|first5=Carmina|last6=Franke|first6=Doris|last7=Harkanyi|first7=Zoltan|last8=Kosiak|first8=Wojciech|last9=Miele|first9=Vittorio|last10=Ntoulia|first10=Aikaterini|last11=Piskunowicz|first11=Maciej|last12=Sellars|first12=Maria|last13=Gilja|first13=Odd|title=Role of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in Paediatric Practice: An EFSUMB Position Statement|journal=Ultraschall in der Medizin – European Journal of Ultrasound|volume=38|issue=01|year=2016|pages=33–43|issn=0172-4614|doi=10.1055/s-0042-110394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bubble echocardiogram==
An [[echocardiogram]] is a study of the [[heart]] using ultrasound. A bubble echocardiogram is an extension of this that uses simple air bubbles as a contrast medium during this study and often has to be requested specifically.

Although colour Doppler can be used to detect abnormal flows between the chambers of the heart (e.g., [[patent foramen ovale|persistent (patent) foramen ovale]]), it has a limited [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]]. When specifically looking for a defect such as this, small air bubbles can be used as a contrast medium and injected intravenously, where they travel to the right side of the heart. The test would be positive for an abnormal communication if the bubbles are seen passing into the left side of the heart. (Normally, they would exit the [[heart]] through the [[pulmonary artery]] and be stopped by the lungs.) This form of bubble contrast medium is generated on an ''[[ad hoc]]'' basis by the testing clinician by agitating [[normal saline]] (e.g., by rapidly and repeatedly transferring the saline between two connected syringes) immediately prior to injection.

==Microbubble contrast agents==&lt;!--Microbubble contrast agents redirects here--&gt;

===General features===
There are a variety of microbubble contrast agents.  Microbubbles differ in their shell makeup, gas core makeup, and whether or not they are targeted.

*'''Microbubble shell''': selection of shell material determines how easily the microbubble is taken up by the [[immune system]].  A more [[hydrophilic]] material tends to be taken up more easily, which reduces the microbubble residence time in the circulation.  This reduces the time available for contrast imaging.  The shell material also affects microbubble mechanical elasticity.  The more elastic the material, the more acoustic energy it can withstand before bursting.&lt;ref name="McCulloch2000"/&gt;  Currently, microbubble shells are composed of [[human serum albumin|albumin]], [[galactose]], [[lipid]], or [[polymers]].&lt;ref name="Lindner2004"/&gt;
*'''Microbubble gas core''': The gas core is the most important part of the ultrasound contrast microbubble because it determines the echogenicity.  When gas bubbles are caught in an ultrasonic [[frequency]] field, they [[compressibility|compress]], [[oscillate]], and reflect a characteristic echo- this generates the strong and unique sonogram in contrast-enhanced ultrasound.  Gas cores can be composed of [[air]], or heavy gases like [[perfluorocarbon]], or [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref name="Lindner2004"/&gt;  Heavy gases are less water-soluble so they are less likely to leak out from the microbubble leading to microbubble dissolution.&lt;ref name="McCulloch2000"/&gt;  As a result, microbubbles with heavy gas cores last longer in circulation.

Regardless of the shell or gas core composition, microbubble size is fairly uniform.  They lie within a range of 1–4 micrometres in diameter.  That makes them smaller than [[red blood cell]]s, which allows them to flow easily through the circulation as well as the microcirculation.

===Specific agents===
*''SonoVue'', made by [[Bracco (company)]], consists in sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles. It is mainly used to characterize liver lesions that cannot be properly identified using conventional (b-mode) ultrasound. The use of SonoVue to assess the early response to anti angiogenetic drugs in cancer chemotherapy has been studied, with promising results. Wider studies are ongoing.
*''Optison'', a [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)-approved microbubble made by [[GE Healthcare]], has an albumin shell and octafluoropropane gas core.  The second FDA-approved microbubble, Levovist, made by [[Schering AG|Schering]], has a lipid/galactose shell and an air core.&lt;ref name="Lindner2004"/&gt;
*''Perflexane lipid microspheres'' (trade name Imagent or previously Imavist) is an injectable suspension developed by [[Alliance Pharmaceutical]] approved by the FDA (in June 2002) for improving visualization of the left ventricular chamber of the heart, the delineation of the endocardial borders in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms. Beside its use to assess cardiac function and perfusion it is also used as an enhancer of the images of prostate, liver, kidney and other organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

*''Perflutren'' lipid microspheres (trade name Definity) are composed of [[octafluoropropane]] encapsulated in an outer [[lipid shell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rxlist.com/definity-drug.htm Rxlist.com &gt; Definity], Last reviewed 6/16/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Targeted microbubbles===
Targeted microbubbles are under preclinical development.  They retain the same general features as untargeted microbubbles, but they are outfitted with ligands that bind specific receptors expressed by cell types of interest, such as inflamed cells or cancer cells.  Current microbubbles in development are composed of a lipid monolayer shell with a perflurocarbon gas core.  The lipid shell is also covered with a [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) layer.  PEG prevents microbubble aggregation and makes the microbubble more non-reactive.  It temporarily “hides” the microbubble from the immune system uptake, increasing the amount of circulation time, and hence, imaging time.&lt;ref name="Klibanov2005"/&gt;   In addition to the PEG layer, the shell is modified with molecules that allow for the attachment of [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] that bind certain [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]].  These ligands are attached to the microbubbles using [[carbodiimide]], [[maleimide]], or biotin-streptavidin coupling.&lt;ref name="Klibanov2005"/&gt;  Biotin-streptavidin is the most popular coupling strategy because [[biotin|biotin’s]] affinity for [[streptavidin]] is very strong and it is easy to label the ligands with biotin.  Currently, these ligands are [[monoclonal antibodies]] produced from animal cell cultures that bind specifically to receptors and molecules expressed by the target cell type.  Since the antibodies are not humanized, they will elicit an immune response when used in human therapy.  Humanizing antibodies is an expensive and time-intensive process, so it would be ideal to find an alternative source of ligands, such as synthetically manufactured targeting [[peptides]] that perform the same function, but without the immune issues.

==How it works==

There are two forms of contrast-enhanced ultrasound, untargeted (used in the clinic today) and targeted (under preclinical development).  The two methods slightly differ from each other.

===Untargeted CEUS===
Untargeted microbubbles, such as the aforementioned SonoVue, Optison, or Levovist, are injected intravenously into the systemic circulation in a small bolus.  The microbubbles will remain in the systemic circulation for a certain period of time.  During that time, ultrasound waves are directed on the area of interest.   When microbubbles in the blood flow past the imaging window, the microbubbles’ [[compressibility|compressible]] gas cores [[oscillate]] in response to the high frequency sonic energy field, as described in the [[ultrasound]] article.  The microbubbles reflect a unique [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] that stands in stark contrast to the surrounding tissue due to the orders of magnitude mismatch between microbubble and tissue echogenicity.  The ultrasound system converts the strong echogenicity into a contrast-enhanced image of the area of interest.  In this way, the bloodstream’s echo is enhanced, thus allowing the clinician to distinguish [[blood]] from surrounding tissues.

===Targeted CEUS===
Targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound works in a similar fashion, with a few alterations.  Microbubbles targeted with ligands that bind certain molecular markers that are expressed by the area of imaging interest are still injected systemically in a small bolus.  Microbubbles theoretically travel through the circulatory system, eventually finding their respective targets and binding specifically.  Ultrasound waves can then be directed on the area of interest.  If a sufficient number of microbubbles have bound in the area, their compressible gas cores oscillate in response to the high frequency sonic energy field, as described in the [[ultrasound]] article. The targeted microbubbles also reflect a unique echo that stands in stark contrast to the surrounding tissue due to the orders of magnitude mismatch between microbubble and tissue echogenicity.  The ultrasound system converts the strong echogenicity into a contrast-enhanced image of the area of interest, revealing the location of the bound microbubbles.&lt;ref name="Klibanov1999"/&gt;  Detection of bound microbubbles may then show that the area of interest is expressing that particular molecular marker, which can be indicative of a certain disease state, or identify particular cells in the area of interest.

==Applications==

Untargeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound is currently applied in [[echocardiography]] and [[radiology]].  Targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound is being developed for a variety of medical applications.

===Untargeted CEUS===
Untargeted microbubbles like Optison and Levovist are currently used in echocardiography. In addition, SonoVue&lt;ref name="Schneider1999"/&gt; ultrasound contrast agent is used in radiology for lesion characterization.   
*'''Organ Edge Delineation''': microbubbles can enhance the contrast at the interface between the tissue and blood.  A clearer picture of this interface gives the clinician a better picture of the structure of an organ.  Tissue structure is crucial in echocardiograms, where a thinning, thickening, or irregularity in the heart wall indicates a serious heart condition that requires either monitoring or treatment.
*'''Blood Volume and Perfusion''': contrast-enhanced ultrasound holds the promise for (1) evaluating the degree of blood perfusion in an organ or area of interest and (2) evaluating the blood volume in an organ or area of interest.  When used in conjunction with [[Medical ultrasonography#Doppler ultrasonography|Doppler]] ultrasound, microbubbles can measure myocardial flow rate to diagnose valve problems.  And the relative intensity of the microbubble echoes&lt;ref name="Rognin2008"/&gt; can also provide a quantitative estimate on blood volume.
*'''Lesion Characterization''': contrast-enhanced ultrasound plays a role in the differentiation between benign and malignant focal liver lesions. This differentiation relies on the observation&lt;ref name=Claudon2012/&gt; or processing&lt;ref name="Rognin2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anaye2011"/&gt; of the dynamic vascular pattern in a lesion with respect to its surrounding tissue [[parenchyma]].

===Targeted CEUS===
*'''[[Inflammation]]''': Contrast agents may be designed to bind to certain proteins that become expressed in inflammatory diseases such as [[Crohn's disease]], [[atherosclerosis]], and even [[heart attacks]]. Cells of interest in such cases are [[endothelial cell]]s of blood vessels, and [[leukocytes]]:
**The inflamed blood vessels specifically express certain receptors, functioning as [[cell adhesion molecules]], like [[inflammation|VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin]]. If microbubbles are targeted with ligands that bind these molecules, they can be used in contrast echocardiography to detect the onset of inflammation.  Early detection allows the design of better treatments. Attempts have been made to outfit microbubbles with monoclonal antibodies that bind  [[selectin|P-selectin]], [[intercellular adhesion molecule|ICAM-1]], and [[VCAM-1]],&lt;ref name="Lindner2004"/&gt; but the adhesion to the molecular target was poor and a large fraction of microbubbles that bound to the target rapidly detached, especially at high shear stresses of physiological relevance.&lt;ref name="Takalkar2004"/&gt;
**[[Leukocytes]] possess high adhesion efficiencies, partly due to a dual-ligand [[selectin]]-[[integrin]] cell arrest system.&lt;ref name="Eniola2003"/&gt; One ligand:receptor pair ([[PSGL-1]]:selectin) has a fast bond on-rate to slow the leukocyte and allows the second pair (integrin:[[immunoglobulin]] superfamily), which has a slower on-rate but slow off-rate to arrest the leukocyte, kinetically enhancing adhesion. Attempts have been made to make contrast agents bind to such ligands, with techniques such as dual-ligand targeting of distinct receptors to polymer microspheres,&lt;ref name="Eniola&amp;Hammer2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weller2005"/&gt; and [[biomimcry]] of the leukocyte’s selectin-integrin cell arrest system,&lt;ref name="Rychak2005"/&gt; having shown an increased adhesion efficiency, but yet not efficient enough to allow clinical use of targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound for inflammation.
*'''[[Thrombosis]] and [[thrombolysis]]''': Activated [[platelets]] are major components of blood clots (thrombi). [[Microbubbles]] can be conjugated to a recombinant [[single-chain variable fragment]] specific for activated [[glycoprotein IIb/IIIa]] (GPIIb/IIIa), which is the most abundant platelet surface receptor. Despite the high shear stress at the thrombus area, the GPIIb/IIIa-targeted microbubbles will specifically bind to activated platelets and allow real-time molecular imaging of thrombosis, such as in [[myocardial infarction]], as well as monitoring success or failure of pharmacological thrombolysis.&lt;ref name="Wang2012"/&gt;
*'''[[Cancer]]''': cancer cells also express a specific set of receptors, mainly receptors that encourage [[angiogenesis]], or the growth of new blood vessels.  If microbubbles are targeted with ligands that bind receptors like [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]], they can non-invasively and specifically identify areas of cancers.
*'''[[gene therapy|Gene Delivery]]''': [[Vector DNA]] can be conjugated to the microbubbles.  Microbubbles can be targeted with ligands that bind to receptors expressed by the cell type of interest.  When the targeted microbubble accumulates at the cell surface with its DNA payload, ultrasound can be used to burst the microbubble.  The force associated with the bursting may temporarily permeablize surrounding tissues and allow the DNA to more easily enter the cells.
*'''Drug Delivery''': drugs can be incorporated into the microbubble’s lipid shell.  The microbubble’s large size relative to other drug delivery vehicles like [[liposomes]] may allow a greater amount of drug to be delivered per vehicle.  By targeted the drug-loaded microbubble with ligands that bind to a specific cell type, microbubble will not only deliver the drug specifically, but can also provide verification that the drug is delivered if the area is imaged using ultrasound.

==Advantages==
On top of the strengths mentioned in the [[medical ultrasonography|medical sonography]] entry, contrast-enhanced ultrasound adds these additional advantages:
*The body is 73% water, and therefore, acoustically homogeneous.  Blood and surrounding tissues have similar echogenicities, so it is also difficult to clearly discern the degree of blood flow, perfusion, or the interface between the tissue and blood using traditional ultrasound.&lt;ref name="Lindner2004"/&gt;
*Ultrasound imaging allows real-time evaluation of blood flow.&lt;ref name="Lindner2002"/&gt;
*Destruction of microbubbles by ultrasound&lt;ref name=Wei1998/&gt; in the image plane allows absolute quantification of tissue perfusion.&lt;ref name="Arditi2006"/&gt;
*Ultrasonic molecular imaging is safer than molecular imaging modalities such as [[radiocontrast|radionuclide imaging]] because it does not involve radiation.&lt;ref name="Lindner2002"/&gt;
*Alternative molecular imaging modalities, such as [[MRI]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], and [[SPECT]] are very costly.  Ultrasound, on the other hand, is very cost-efficient and widely available.&lt;ref name="Klibanov1999"/&gt;
*Since microbubbles can generate such strong signals, a lower intravenous dosage is needed, micrograms of microbubbles are needed compared to milligrams for other molecular imaging modalities such as [[MRI contrast agent]]s.&lt;ref name="Klibanov1999"/&gt;
*Targeting strategies for microbubbles are versatile and modular.  Targeting a new area only entails conjugating a new ligand.
*Active targeting can be increased (enhanced microbubbles adhesion) by [[Acoustic radiation force]]&lt;ref name=Rychak2005b/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dayton1999/&gt; using a clinical ultrasound imaging system in 2D-mode &lt;ref name=Frinking2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gessner2012/&gt; and 3D-mode.&lt;ref name=Rognin2013/&gt;

==Disadvantages==
In addition to the weaknesses mentioned in the [[medical ultrasonography|medical sonography]] entry, contrast-enhanced ultrasound suffers from the following disadvantages:
*Microbubbles don’t last very long in circulation.  They have low circulation residence times because they either get taken up by immune system cells or get taken up by the [[liver]] or [[spleen]] even when they are coated with PEG.&lt;ref name="Klibanov1999"/&gt;
*Ultrasound produces more heat as the frequency increases, so the ultrasonic frequency must be carefully monitored.
*Microbubbles burst at low ultrasound frequencies and at high mechanical indices (MI), which is the measure of the negative acoustic pressure of the ultrasound imaging system.  Increasing MI increases image quality, but there are tradeoffs with microbubble destruction.  Microbubble destruction could cause local microvasculature ruptures and [[hemolysis]].&lt;ref name="Klibanov2005"/&gt;
*Targeting ligands can be immunogenic, since current targeting ligands used in preclinical experiments are derived from [[animal culture]].&lt;ref name="Klibanov2005"/&gt;
*Low targeted microbubble adhesion efficiency, which means a small fraction of injected microbubbles bind to the area of interest.&lt;ref name="Takalkar2004"/&gt; This is one of the main reasons that targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound remains in the preclinical development stages.

'''Cricut''' is the brand-name of a product range of home [[Die cutting (web)|die-cutting]] machines (or [[plotter#Cutting plotters|cutting plotters]]) used for [[scrapbooking]] and various projects,&lt;ref&gt;McCartney, Joyce (June 24, 2010). [http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20100623/BLOGS26/100629816 "Machines make crafting more creative."] ''The Journal Gazette''.&lt;/ref&gt; made by Provo Craft &amp; Novelty, Inc. (also known as "Provo Craft") of [[Spanish Fork, Utah|Spanish Fork]], [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4319784 | title=Company Overview of Provo Craft and Novelty, Inc. | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machines are used for cutting paper, felt, vinyl, fabric&lt;ref&gt;Wayner, Peter (December 2, 2009).[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/technology/personaltech/03CRAFTS.html?_r=0 "For Crafters, the Gift of Automation."] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; and other products such as [[Fondant icing|fondant]]. Cricut is among several electronic die cutters used by paper crafters, card makers and scrapbookers.

==Models==
The original cricut machine had cutting mats of 6 × 12&amp;nbsp;inches, the larger ''Cricut Expression'' only allows mats of 12 × 12 and 12 × 24. The largest machine will produce letters from a half inch to 23{{fraction|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inches high. Both the ''Cricut'' and ''Cricut Expression'' require mats and [[blade]]s which can be adjusted to cut through various types of paper, vinyl and other sheet products. The ''Cricut personal paper cutter'' operates as a paper cutter based upon cutting parameters programmed into the machine, and resembles a desktop printer.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;Flaherty, Joseph (April 18, 2012). [https://www.wired.com/design/2012/04/makerbot-pinterest-craft-juggernaut/ "MakerBot + Pinterest = Craft Juggernaut."] Wired Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cricut Cake'' produces stylized edible [[Fondant icing|fondant]]s cut into various shapes from fondant sheets, and is used by chefs in the preparation and ornamentation of [[cake]]s.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

===Original Cricut===
The original cricut comes with a 6" x 12" cutting mat and images can be cut in a range from 1" to 5 1/2" tall.&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.cricut.com/home/using-your-cricut/original-cricut#FromTheCommunity&lt;/ref&gt; The original cricut is compatible with all original cricut cartridges. The original cricut does not have the ability to cut as many different types of materials that the newer cricut machines can. However Cricut does make a Deep Cut Blade &amp; Housing that can allow original cricut owners to cut material up to 1.55mm thick, such as magnet, chipboard, and stamp materials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricut.com/Shopping/detail--Cricut-Deep-Cut-Blade--Housing-184-200.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The original cricut is also compatible with the Cricut Design Craft Room.

===Cricut Expression===
The Cricut Expression® offers several advantages over the previous model.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricut.com/home/learn/machines/expression&lt;/ref&gt;  First, it allows users to cut shapes and fonts in a range from ¼" to 23½", and comes with a 12" x 12" cutting matting with adjustable slides so that users no longer need to trim their media down to 6" x 12". It cuts a wider range of materials, including vellum, fabric, chipboard, vinyl, and thin foils. It also features an LCD Screen to preview the work, and has features such Quantity and Auto-Fill. A "Paper Saver" mode and choice of Portrait or Landscape Orientation have also been added. The basic model has two cartridges included in the purchase, Plantin SchoolBook and Accent Essentials.

===Cricut Expression 2===
The cricut expression 2 has an updated exterior from the cricut expression. It comes with a 12" x 12" cutting mat. This machine does not have the keyboard that the original cricut and the cricut expression have. Instead it features a new full-color LCD touch screen. The LCD touch screen displays the keyboard on the screen and allows you to see where your images will be on the mat prior to cutting. It also has the new feature of independent image sizing and image rotation directly on the LCD screen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricut.com/home/learn/machines/expression-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cricut Mini===
The cricut mini is a small personal electronic cutting machine. Unlike the other cricut machines it only works with a computer, it can not cut images standing alone. You have to use Cricut Craft Room design software. The cricut mini comes with over 500 images that are automatically unlocked when you connect your cricut with the Cricut Craft Room design software or the Cricut Gypsy device.&lt;ref name="beta.cricut.com"&gt;http://beta.cricut.com/home/using-your-cricut/mini&lt;/ref&gt; The machine does have a cartridge port that is compatible with all cricut cartridges except the cricut imagine cartridges. The cricut mini also features a unique mat size of 8.5" x 12". The cricut mini can cut images in a range of 1/4" to 11 1/2".&lt;ref name="beta.cricut.com"/&gt;
The Cricut Mini relied exclusively on using Cricut Craft Room, a computer program which no longer functions. Of all the Legacy Cricut machines, the Mini is the only one that is now obsolete and not usable in any way.  As no recourse was provided to the customers who had purchased cartridges for that machine, Provo-Craft is now the focus of many complaints for customers who were left with no recourse for this unexpected forced 'sun-setting' of the machine.

===Cricut Explore Air===
The Explore Air is a wireless die cutting machine that can cut a variety of materials from paper to fabric and more.

===Cricut Explore Air 2===
The Explore Air 2 is minor refresh of the Explore Air line which added three colors (Mint Blue, Rose Anna, Giffin Lilac) as well as a Fast Mode to cut vinyl, iron-on, and cardstock at "up to 2x speeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.cricut.com/help/cricut-explore-difference|title=Cricut machines comparison chart {{!}} Cricut Help Center|website=Cricut Help Center|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cricut Maker===
The Cricut Maker is a new line released on August 20, 2017, designed to cut thicker materials such as Balsawood, Basswood, non-bonded fabric, leather, and felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://inspiration.cricut.com/cricut-maker/|title=Cricut Maker is Here!|date=2017-08-03|work=Cricut|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maker is the only Cricut machine that supports the use of a Rotary Blade for cutting fabric directly, and a scoring wheel with variable pressure to score thicker papers than the original scoring stylus.

==Cartridges==
Designs are made from components stored on [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]]. Each cartridge comes with a keyboard overlay and instruction booklet. The plastic keyboard overlay indicates key selections for that cartridge only. However recently Provo Craft has released a "Universal Overlay" that is compatible with all cartridges released after August 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricut.com/Shopping/detail--Universal-Overlay-0-11931.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the universal overlay is to simplify the process of cutting by only having to learn one keyboard overlay instead of having to learn the overlay for each individual cartridge. Designs can be cut out on a PC with the Cricut Design Studio software, on a USB connected Gypsy machine, or can be directly inputed on the Cricut machine using the keyboard overlay. There are two types of cartridges shape and font. Each cartridge has a variety of creative features which can allow for hundreds of different cuts from just one cartridge. There are currently over 275 cartridges that are available (separately from the machine), containing fonts and shapes, with new ones added monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= August 26, 2011 |title= Cricut Cartridges |url= http://www.cricut.com/information/cartridge_library.aspx |publisher= Provo Craft |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110902055819/http://www.cricut.com/information/cartridge_library.aspx |archivedate= September 2, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some cartridges are generic in content, Cricut has licensing agreements with [[Disney]], [[Pixar]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Sesame Street]], [[DC Comics]] and [[Hello Kitty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricut.com/shopping/products-Famous-Friends-258.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128140042/http://www.cricut.com/shopping/products-Famous-Friends-258.aspx |archive-date=2014-01-28 |website=www.cricut.com |title=Featured Brands - Cricut Shop |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cricut line has a range of prices, but the cartridges are interchangeable, although not all options on a cartridge may be available with the smaller machines.  All cartridges work only with Cricut software, must be registered to a single user for use and cannot be sold or given away.  A cartridge purchased for a discontinued machine is likely to become useless at the point the machine is discontinued.   Cricut reserves the right to discontinue support for some versions of their software at any time, which can make some cartridges immediately obsolete.

==Software==

===Proprietary===
The Cricut Craft Room software enables users to combine images from different cartridges, merge images, and stretch/rotate images; it does not allow for the creation of arbitrary designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.cricut.com/forum/cricut-community_postst135815_Can-Cricut-Cut-Custom-Shapes-and-Designs.aspx |title=Can Cricut Cut Custom Shapes &amp; Designs? - Craft Room Application - Cricut Forums |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125103212/http://us.cricut.com/forum/cricut-community_postst135815_Can-Cricut-Cut-Custom-Shapes-and-Designs.aspx |archive-date=2015-01-25 |website=us.cricut.com |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also enables the user to view the images displayed on-screen before beginning the cutting process, so the end result can be seen in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.cricut.com/forum/cricut-community_postst164803_Original-Expression-and-the-new-Cricut-Design-Space.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327152922/http://us.cricut.com/forum/cricut-community_postst164803_Original-Expression-and-the-new-Cricut-Design-Space.aspx |archive-date=2015-03-27 |title=Original Expression and the new Cricut Design Space - Expression Machine [29-0300] - Cricut Forums |website=us.cricut.com |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing Adobe's abandonment of Flash, Cricut announced it would be closing Cricut Craft Room on 15 July 2018. Users of "legacy" machines were offered a discount to update to models compatible with Cricut Design Space. As of 16 July 2018, Design Space is the only software available to compose projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inspiration.cricut.com/cricut-craft-room-closing/ Important News for Cricut Craft Room Users]. Accessed 10 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;   Design Space is not compatible with cartridges formerly purchased for the Cricut Mini, which was force-sunset in October 2018.

===Third-party===
Provo Craft has been actively hostile to the use of third-party software programs that could enable Cricut owners to cut out designs and to use the machine without depending on its proprietary cartridges.  In a comparative review of die-cutting machines, review site ''[[TopTenReviews]]'' identified being "limited to cutting designs from a collection of cartridges" as a major drawback of the Cricut range, though the review noted that it could be a preference for some.&lt;ref&gt;[http://die-cutting-machines-review.toptenreviews.com/cricut-expression-review.html Cricut Expression review], ''[[Top Ten Reviews]]''. Accessed 26 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two programs which could formerly be used to make and then get Cricut machines to cut out arbitrary designs (using, for example, arbitrary [[TrueType]] fonts or [[SVG]] format graphics) were Make-the-Cut (MTC) and Craft Edge's Sure Cuts A Lot (SCAL). In April 2010 Provo Craft opened legal action against the publishers of Make-the-Cut,&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Nally, [http://www.scrapbookupdate.com/2010/04/07/provo-craft-sues-make-the-cut/ Provo Craft Sues Make The Cut], Scrapbook Update, 7 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2011 it sued Craft Edge to stop the distribution of the SCAL program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Nally |first= Nancy |date=March 11, 2011 |title= Provo Craft Sues Sure Cuts A Lot, Alleging Copyright Violations |url= http://www.scrapbookupdate.com/2011/03/11/provo-craft-sues-sure-cuts-a-lot-alleging-copyright-violations/ |publisher=Scrapbook Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases the publishers settled with Provo Craft, and removed support for Cricut from their products. The programs continue to be usable with other home cutters.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Nally, [http://www.scrapbookupdate.com/2011/03/11/make-the-cut-settles-cricut-software-lawsuit-with-provo-craft/ Make The Cut Settles Cricut Software Lawsuit With Provo Craft], Scrapbook Update, 11 March 2011&lt;br&gt;Nancy Nally, [http://www.scrapbookupdate.com/2011/04/05/provo-craft-issues-statement-on-mtc-scal-lawsuits/ Provo Craft Issues Statement on MTC, SCAL Lawsuits], Scrapbook Update, 5 April 2011&lt;br&gt;[http://scrpbooklady.blogspot.com/2011/05/communication-from-craft-edge.html Communication from Craft Edge], Notes from the Scrapbooklady (blog), 17 May 2011&lt;br&gt;[http://www.ukscrappers.co.uk/boards/printthread.php?t=312862&amp;pp=15 Update on SCAL and Provocraft], UK Scrappers, 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the text of its legal complaint against Craft Edge, "Provo Craft uses various techniques to encrypt and obscure the USB communications between Cricut DesignStudio [a design program supplied with the hardware] and the Cricut e-cutter, in order to protect Provo Craft's proprietary software and firmware, and to prevent attempts to intercept the cutting commands".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabberone.com/Trademarks/HallOfShame/CraftSites/Cricut/lawsuits/11cv0297_20110124_Complaint.pdf Complaint: Provo Craft and Novelty Inc. v. Craft Edge Inc.], at 28 (page 6)&lt;/ref&gt; Provo Craft contended that in order to [[reverse engineering|understand and replicate]] this obscured protocol, Craft Edge had [[disassembler|disassembled]] the DesignStudio program, contrary to the terms of its [[End User License Agreement]], thereby (the company asserted) breaching copyright law.  Provo Craft also asserted that Craft Edge were violating its trademark in the word "Cricut" by saying that its software could work with Cricut machines.  Provo Craft asserted that this was likely "to cause confusion, mistake or deception as to the source or origin of Defendant's goods or services, and [was] likely to falsely suggest a sponsorship, connection, license, or association of Defendant's goods and services with Provo Craft".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabberone.com/Trademarks/HallOfShame/CraftSites/Cricut/lawsuits/11cv0297_20110124_Complaint.pdf Complaint: Provo Craft and Novelty Inc. v. Craft Edge Inc.], at 57 (page 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of this is that customers with older versions of cricut machines that were 'force sunset' by discontinuation of software support have no alternative software to use with their now obsolete machines.

It was founded in 1909 and is situated in [[Copenhagen]] in the area of [[Islands Brygge]].

Its areas of responsibility range widely, including establishment of patient safety, coordination and monitoring of [[health promotion]] and [[Prevention (medical)|disease prevention]], advisory functions, etc.

The Director General was Else Smith from 2011-15.

In August 2015, Minister for Health Sophie Løhde announced that she will strengthen the focus on core tasks, case handling and the development of the health area by establishing four new agencies under the Danish Ministry of Health: The Danish Health Authority, the Danish Patient Safety Authority, the Danish Health Data Authority and the Danish Medicines Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sundhedsstyrelsen.dk/en/news/2015/the-danish-ministry-of-health-has-appointed-three-new-directors-general|title=The Danish Ministry of Health has appointed three new Directors General|website=Sundhedsstyrelsen.dk|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differentiation from similar disciplines ==
Digital medicine is sometimes confused with similar disciplines, including the broader category of digital health, as well as [[digital therapeutics]], another digital health subset. Digital health offerings use digital technologies to enhance human health in some capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://storyofdigitalhealth.com/definition/|title=Definition of Digital Health - Paul Sonnier|work=Paul Sonnier - Story of Digital Health|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this broader category, programs that include a prescription medication with an ingestible sensor component are considered digital medicines. By contrast, digital therapeutics are associated mainly with web-based health management tools and stand-alone health apps, generally without a prescription medication element.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michie|first=Susan|last2=Yardley|first2=Lucy|last3=West|first3=Robert|last4=Patrick|first4=Kevin|last5=Greaves|first5=Felix|date=2017-06-29|title=Developing and Evaluating Digital Interventions to Promote Behavior Change in Health and Health Care: Recommendations Resulting From an International Workshop|url=https://www.jmir.org/2017/6/e232/|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|language=en|volume=19|issue=6|pages=e232|doi=10.2196/jmir.7126|pmid=28663162|issn=1438-8871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approval pathways ==
The ingestible sensor component associated with digital medicines was originally approved in 2012 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the Center for Devices and Radiological Health via a de novo pathway for novel, low-risk medical devices.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/k113070.pdf|title=EVALUATION OF AUTOMATIC CLASS III DESIGNATION (DE NOVO) FOR PROTEUS PERSONAL MONITOR INCLUDING INGESTION EVENT MARKER|last=|first=|date=|website=FDA.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approval has been accompanied by FDA 510(k) clearances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The ingestible sensor is CE marked in Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A New Drug Application for the first fully integrated pharmaceutical with ingestible sensor component, [[Otsuka Pharmaceutical]]'s ABILIFY MYCITE® (aripiprazole with Proteus ingestible sensor), was approved by the FDA in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm584933.htm|title=Press Announcements - FDA approves pill with sensor that digitally tracks if patients have ingested their medication|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its approval of the [[digital pill]], the FDA confirmed that the review of digital medicines includes assessment of the ingestible device component, and that no additional safety and efficacy data is required for the original pharmaceutical.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Indications ==
Digital medicines are being used for a variety of conditions in commercial and clinical settings. Medications with ingestible sensors are being prescribed in the treatment areas of [[hypertension]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypercholesterolemia]], [[heart failure]], [[Hepatitis C]], [[mental health]], [[HIV]], [[Tuberculosis|TB]] and [[organ transplantation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frias|first=Juan|last2=Virdi|first2=Naunihal|last3=Raja|first3=Praveen|last4=Kim|first4=Yoona|last5=Savage|first5=George|last6=Osterberg|first6=Lars|date=2017-07-11|title=Effectiveness of Digital Medicines to Improve Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Uncontrolled Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes: Prospective, Open-Label, Cluster-Randomized Pilot Clinical Trial|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=19|issue=7|doi=10.2196/jmir.7833|issn=1439-4456|pmc=5527253|pmid=28698169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-bsi-proteus-smart-pill-20170616-story.html|title=This 'smart pill' can help Rush patients remember their meds|last=Holly|first=Robert|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/following-a-prescription-is-hard-this-digital-pill-wants-to-help|title=This digital pill wants to make following your prescription easier|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Barton Health became the first institution to commercially offer digital medicines to patients with [[Chronic condition|chronic medical conditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertglatter/2016/01/13/barton-health-first-to-offer-new-digital-medicine-developed-by-proteus-digital-health/#7176cda41b33|title=Barton Health First To Offer New Digital Medicine Developed By Proteus Digital Health|last=MD|first=Robert Glatter,|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Children's Health in Dallas, Texas became the first to commercially use digital medicines with [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/2016/08/19/childrens-dallas-testing-digitizeddrugs-remind-patients-take-medicine|title=Children's Health Dallas testing 'digitized drugs' with sensors inside|date=2016-08-19|work=Dallas News|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical concerns ==
Bioethicists have expressed concerns around technologies that log and share information about patients’ medication-taking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/health/digital-pill-fda.html|title=First Digital Pill Approved to Worries About Biomedical ‘Big Brother’|last=Belluck|first=Pam|date=2017-11-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These concerns exist from the perspective of both individual and collective patient rights. However, proponents note that participation in digital medicine programs are voluntary, comply with all applicable laws and standards, and protect patient data in accordance with applicable state and federal privacy regulations, as with other data generated and stored in electronic medical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-14/fda-approves-a-digital-pill-that-can-track-when-you-swallowed-it|title=Digital Pill That Tracks Use When Swallowed Gets FDA Approval|date=2017-11-14|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experts add that digital medicine programs show promise as a solution to [[Adherence (medicine)|medication adherence]], and help physicians more accurately titrate dosages and determine how well the medication worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/11/14/fda-digital-pill-proteus-otsuka/|title=The Digital Pill Era Is Here—And It Could Help Solve a $300 Billion Health Care Problem|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distal trisomy 10''' is a rare [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomal disorder]] that causes several physical defects and [[intellectual disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&amp;Expert=96102|title=Orphanet: Distal trisomy 10q|last=RESERVED|first=INSERM US14 -- ALL RIGHTS|website=www.orpha.net|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans, like all sexually reproducing species, have [[somatic cells]] that are in [[diploid]] ['''2N'''] state, meaning that '''N''' represent the number of [[chromosome]]s, and '''2''' the number of their copies. In humans, there are 23 chromosomes, but there are two sets of them, one from [[mother]] and one from [[father]], totaling in 46, that are arranged according to their size, function and genes they carry. Each cell is supposed to have two of each, but sometimes due to mutations or malfunctions during cell division, mistakes are made that cause serious health problems. One such error is the cause of Distal trisomy 10q disorder. 

Each chromosome has two arms, labeled '''p''' (for petite, or short) and '''q''' (for long). If both arms are equal in length, the chromosome is said to be [[Centromere#Metacentric|metacentric]]. If arms' lengths are unequal, chromosome is said to be [[submetacentric]], and if p arm is so short that is hard to observe, but still present, then the chromosome is [[acrocentric]]. In Distal Trisomy 10q disorder, end or distal portion of the q (long) arm of the [[chromosome]] number 10 appears to be present three times, rather than two times as it is supposed to be. This extra arm results in chromosome 10 [[trisomy]], meaning that three arms are present. Depending on the length of the aberrant arm, the severity can vary from case to case. Often the source of this chromosomal error is a translocation in one of the parents.  Sometimes it occurs spontaneously, in which case it is termed ''[[mutation|de novo]]''.

This syndrome has a large range of outcomes depending on how much chromosomal material is involved.  Outcomes include: very slow postnatal growth, [[hypotonia]], lack of coordination skills and mild to severe cases of [[intellectual disability]], digestive issues, and [[heart]] and [[kidney]] problems. Individuals with this disorder can also be distinguished by their facial features. Number of support groups do exist in the [[United States]], where affected families can meet and discuss problems they encounter, possible treatments and can find emotional support.

The maxillae are paired structures that can also move at right angles to the body and possess segmented palps. The labium (lower lip) is the fused structure that moves longitudinally and possesses a pair of segmented [[palp]]s.&lt;ref name="Insect Morphology"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.entomology.umn.edu/cues/4015/morpology/ | title = Insect Morphology | accessdate = 2011-03-21 | publisher = University of Minisotta (Department of Entomology) | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110303060627/http://www.entomology.umn.edu/cues/4015/morpology/ | archivedate = 2011-03-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouthparts, along with the rest of the head, can be articulated in at least three different positions: [[prognathous]], [[opisthognathous]] and [[hypognathous]]. In species with prognathous articulation, the head is positioned vertically aligned with the body, such as species of [[Formicidae]]; while in a hypognathous type, the head is aligned horizontally adjacent to the body. In an opisthognathous head, it was positioned diagonally, such as species of [[Blattodea]] and some [[Coleoptera]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zin.ru/animalia/coleoptera/eng/morph1.htm | title = Head |accessdate = 2011-03-21 | last = Kirejtshuk | first = A.G. | date = November 2002 | work = Beetles (Coleoptera) and coleopterologist | publisher = zin.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mouthparts very greatly among insects of different orders but there are two main functional groups: mandibulate and haustellate. Haustellate mouthparts are those used for sucking liquids and can be further classified, by the presence of [[stylet (anatomy)|stylet]]s, which include: piercing-sucking, sponging, and siphoning. The stylets are needle-like projections used to penetrate plant and animal tissue. The stylets and the feeding tube form the modified mandibles, maxilla, and hypopharynx.&lt;ref name="Insect Morphology"/&gt;

*'''Mandibulate''': These forms of mouthparts are among the most common in insects, which are used for biting and grinding solid foods.
*'''Piercing-sucking''': These forms of mouthparts have stylets, and are used to penetrate solid tissue and then suck up liquid food.
*'''Sponging''': These forms of mouthparts are used to sponge and suck liquids and lack stylets (e.g. most [[Diptera]]).
*'''Siphoning''': These forms of mouthparts lack stylets and are used to suck liquids, which are commonly found among species of [[Lepidoptera]].

Mouthparts that are mandibular are found in species of [[Odonata]], [[Blattodea]], adult [[Neuroptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Hymenoptera]], [[Orthoptera]], and [[Lepidoptera]]. However most adult Lepidoptera have siphoning mouthparts, while the larvae (commonly called [[caterpillar]]s) are the ones with the mandibles.

The '''Edmonton Composting Facility''' is the site of the City of [[Edmonton]]'s co-[[composting]] system for processing [[organic waste]]. Co-composting involves mixing [[household waste]] with [[biosolids]] ([[sewage sludge]]), and using microorganisms to break them down into simple [[compost]]. Together with the city's three [[recycling]] programs, Edmonton was able to divert 60% of household waste from [[landfill]]s in 2009. By 2013, the city anticipated that it would divert more than 90% of household waste from landfills.&lt;ref name="Edmonton Composting Facility"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmonton.ca/for_residents/garbage-recycling.aspx |author=City of Edmonton|title=Edmonton Composting Facility|accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size==
The co-composter is the largest in North America by volume and capacity.  It can process {{convert|200000|tonne}} of residential waste and {{convert|25000|tonnes}} (dry) of biosolids each year. It is also the largest [[stainless steel]] building in North America.  It occupies an area the size of eight [[Canadian football]] fields: 38,690 square metres (416,500 square feet).

The '''European Vegetarian Union''' ('''EVU''') is a [[Non-profit organisation|non-profit]], [[Non-governmental organisation|non-governmental]] [[umbrella organisation]] for vegetarian societies and groups in Europe. The [[Trade union|union]] works in the areas of [[vegetarianism]], [[nutrition]], [[health]], [[consumer protection]], the campaign for [[animal rights]], [[ecology]], general information and against [[Malnutrition|world hunger]]. Headquarters are in [[Winterthur]] (Switzerland), together with the Swiss organisation [[Swissveg]].

== History ==
* The EVU distribute the 1995 film ''[[Devour the Earth]]'' about the global [[Ethics of eating meat|consequences of meat consumption]]. The film was produced by the [[Vegetarian Society]], written by [[Tony Wardle]] and narrated by [[Paul McCartney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpreservationfoundation.org/ecotrailers.php?id=11#.UEi_DSI4cy1|title=Devour the Earth|publisher=World Preservation Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107023436/http://www.worldpreservationfoundation.org/ecotrailers.php?id=11#.UEi_DSI4cy1|archivedate=2013-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroveg.eu/lang/dk/news/books/devour_the_earth.php|title=Devour the Earth|publisher=EVU|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014222536/http://www.euroveg.eu/lang/dk/news/books/devour_the_earth.php|archivedate=2013-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2011, Renato Pichler, President of the EVU, reported that the French government's ''Décret 2011-1227'' and associated ''Arrêté'' (September 30, 2011) effectively outlaws the serving of [[veganism|vegan]] meals at any public or private school in [[France]]. Similar decrees are proposed for kindergartens, hospitals, prisons and retirement homes.&lt;ref&gt;Renato Pichler [http://www.euroveg.eu/lang/en/news/press/20111014.php "The French Government Outlaws Vegetarianism in Schools"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024163237/http://www.euroveg.eu/lang/en/news/press/20111014.php |date=October 24, 2011 }}, European Vegetarian Union (EVU). *Also see [http://www.evana.org/index.php?id=67865&amp;lang=en "The French Government Outlaws Vegetarianism in Schools"], European Vegetarian and Animal News Alliance (EVANA).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The main activities of the EVU are:

* To support and represent member societies on a European level, and to offer a platform for close cooperation; 
* To raise public awareness of, and promote vegetarianism, vegetarian issues and the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle;
* To lobby governments, European institutions and organisations for greater recognition of vegetarian issues in policy decisions; and 
* To further promote the successful '''V-label''' scheme (Universal Vegetarian Symbol), in the interest of all vegetarian and vegan consumers across Europe and the rest of the world. The V-Label is a standardised European vegetarian label from the EVU with the aim of easy identification of vegetarian products and services.

{{About||the Australian bureau|Australian Federal Police}}

The '''Federal Bureau of Narcotics''' ('''FBN''') was an agency of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. Established in the Department of the Treasury by an act of June 14, 1930  consolidating the functions of the Federal Narcotics Control Board and the Narcotic Division. These older bureaus were established to assume enforcement responsibilities assigned to the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]], 1914 and the [[Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act]], 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/170.html#170.3|title=Records of the Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA]|date=15 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (aka Jones-Miller Act)

[[Harry J. Anslinger]] was appointed its first commissioner by [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Andrew Mellon]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]]. Under Anslinger, the bureau lobbied for harsh penalties for drug usage. The FBN is credited for criminalizing drugs such as [[cannabis]] with the [[1937 Marijuana Tax Act|Marijuana Tax Act of 1937]], as well as strengthening the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914. Even so, the main focus of the FBN was fighting [[opium]] and [[heroin]] smuggling. One instance against opium was The Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5U4PGMlFkacC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=the+opium+poppy+control+act+of+1942+.gov&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I0WEBSueMU&amp;sig=8yCsr9ig-QkpAml3KA8bz-v5Y9U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g-GtTrT-IrKOigL7s4SlCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Traffic in Narcotics|first1=Harry Jacob|last1=Anslinger|first2=William F.|last2=Tompkins|date=1 January 1980|publisher=Arno Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end the FBN over time established several offices overseas in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Turkey]], [[Beirut]], [[Thailand]] and other hotspots of international narcotics smuggling. These agents (never totaling more than 17) cooperated with local drug enforcement agencies in gathering intelligence on smugglers and also made [[undercover]] busts locally. The work against heroin and opium was however hamstrung by US [[foreign policy]] considerations: during the [[Vietnam War]] for instance great importance was placed on investigating minor Vietnamese smugglers that could be connected to the resistance while investigations of large scale smugglers from the US ally Thailand were left unfinished.

Anslinger retired in 1962 and was succeeded by [[Henry Giordano]], who was the commissioner of the FBN until it was merged in 1968 with the [[Bureau of Drug Abuse Control]], an agency of the Food and Drug Administration, to form the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]], an agency of the United States Department of Justice. The BNDD was a predecessor agency of the current [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA).

In 1992, he became the first religious leader in Africa to publicly announce that he was HIV positive.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-03-17-hivpositive-religious-leaders-break-their-silence HIV-positive religious leaders break their silence].

Retrieved on 26 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmdahivinitiative.org/pages/canon-gideon-byamugisha.php Canon Gideon Byamugisha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227092152/http://www.icmdahivinitiative.org/pages/canon-gideon-byamugisha.php |date=27 February 2009 }} – ICMDA Worldwide.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Byamugisha received the 26th annual [[Niwano Peace Prize]] "in recognition of his work to uphold the dignity and human rights of people living with HIV/AIDS".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npf.or.jp/english/Peace_Prize_Detail/reason/26.html Why the 26th Niwano Peace Prize is being awarded to The Reverend Canon Gideon Baguma Byamugisha.]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – Dr. Gunnar Stålsett, Chairman, Niwano Peace Prize Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

Byamugisha co-founded the African Network of Religious Leaders Living with and Personally Affected HIV and Aids ([[ANERELA+]]) in February 2002,&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt; and in 2006 started a shelter for orphans of AIDS victims.&lt;ref name="nolen28"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolen|first=Stephanie|title=28 Stories of AIDS in Africa|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|location=New York|year=2007|edition=First U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lives with his wife and three HIV negative children.&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt;

==Early life==
Byamugisha is from [[Kigezi]], near the Ugandan border with [[Rwanda]], the eldest of fourteen children.  He was a history and geography teacher, as well as a deputy headmaster, before beginning his theology studies in his twenties.  He was most interested in the philosophy of religion.

In 1990, Byamugisha's his first wife Kellen gave birth to his daughter, Patience, and both parents had been accepted to study at graduate programs in Britain.  These plans changed when Kellen developed chest pains in April 1991, dying a week later.  Six months later, Byamugisha learned that his wife had died of AIDS.&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt;

Byamugisha does not know where he contracted the virus.  He and his wife were not tested before their marriage, and in 1988 he had been in a serious bicycling accident which required injections and a [[blood transfusion]] at a time when medical supplies and blood were not routinely screened for HIV.&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt;

==Coping with HIV==
Although there was a possibility that he would lose his job because of the stigma associated with AIDS, Byamugisha decided to tell the principal of the college he worked at and other staff members about his condition.  Although they were supportive of him, they asked him not to tell others.  He began telling his students, and then other members of his church.  He considers this to have been a risky choice, as community members often worried that this would harm the image of the church.&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt;

Byamugisha claims that he never felt guilty about his status.  "The only regret I have is that I lacked information. I have all this education—two degrees, one first class—but I failed a HIV test."  However, in 1996 he fell ill and lost 40 pounds because he had no access to [[antiretroviral drug]]s (ARVs).  Told that he would only live 6 months without ARVs, the bishop of Kampala used the church network to find two donors (an American and a Singaporean) who began sending him the drugs in 1997.&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt;

==ANERELA+==
As he started to travel and speak about his condition, Byamugisha began encountering other religious leaders who were HIV infected, or personally affected by the death and illness of family members, but were not ready to publicly discuss their conditions.  At the time, there was much misinformation about AIDS and HIV in Africa, and because of the promises and edicts from Christian, [[Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] groups on the continent, to have a religious leader infected or even affected personally was unthinkable.&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt;

In 1998, Byamugisha began to feel the need to organise the religious community with personal ties to HIV/AIDS.  In 2002, he secured funds to host a meeting of the religious leaders who had come to him privately in the past, and 42 leaders met with him in the Collins Hotel, in Nyanga Hills, some 300&amp;nbsp;km outside [[Harare]].  Eight of the participants were HIV+, and this group later became the African Network of Religious Leaders Living with and Personally Affected HIV and Aids ([[ANERELA+]]),&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt; and grew to more than 2000 members in 39 countries by the end of 2006.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt;

==Other HIV/AIDS advocacy==
Byamugisha has become prominent in the international HIV/AIDS community.  He has worked as an advisor to [[World Vision]] and has travelled internationally to speak about HIV/AIDS,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/sundaynights/stories/s1686318.htm An openly HIV positive Anglican priest visiting Australia to speak against the stigma of AIDS in Africa]. Abc.net.au (16 July 2006). Retrieved on 26 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; including to a conference at the US [[White House]] in December 2002.&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt; Byamugisha advocates the view that HIV related issues reveal problems in other areas of society, such as poverty, literacy rates, social inequality, gender relations, trade, and government policy.  Fixing these issues, he claims, will have a significant effect on the AIDS epidemic in Africa.&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt;

Major issues Byamugisha sees in charity organisations include their insistence on policies that match the domestic agendas of donor agencies rather than accept the realities of society in Africa.  While the Catholic Church and other religious communities had softened their stance on condom usage and AIDS education in Africa, organisations such as the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR), the biggest donor in Uganda, continued to insist on education about abstinence or delay of sexual debut for young people, and on fidelity or partner reduction for most adults, two interventions Byamugisha has been critical of as "stigmatizing" to those who cannot or will not abstain or be faithful to one partner. He also criticised PEPFAR's use of non-generic HIV drugs.  In the first year of operation, PEPFAR insisted that only brand-name HIV drugs be used, though they are five times more expensive than the generic brands, and, Byamugisha pointed out, can only be used to treat five times fewer people.  Byamugisha blamed the private agendas of the US pharmaceutical industry and the US evangelical Christian lobby for such policies which do not resonate with the realities of Africa.&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt;

Byamugisha also collaborated in 2003 with photographer [[Gideon Mendel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gideonmendel.com/ Mendel's personal homepage]. Gideonmendel.com. Retrieved on 26 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gideonmendel Gideon Mendel Profile] – Guardian UK.&lt;/ref&gt; on the book ''A Broken Landscape: HIV &amp; AIDS in Africa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-104728792.html A Broken Landscape (Book Review)] – Highbeam (1 July 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Byamugisha lives with his HIV positive wife Pamela (who runs a hardware store), with one HIV negative daughter from his previous marriage, Patience, and two HIV negative daughters, Love and Gift, whom he had with Pamela.  The couple decided to have Love and Gift after drugs to prevent transmission of the virus from mother to child became available in 2000.&lt;ref name="nolen28"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">'''Grassroot Soccer''' (GRS) is a [[nonprofit organization]] and adolescent health organization that leverages the power of soccer to educate, inspire, and mobilize
youth in developing countries to overcome their greatest health challenges, live healthier, more productive lives, and be agents for
change in their communities. &lt;ref&gt;Our Mission, "[https://www.grassrootsoccer.org/overview/]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Grassroot Soccer, Inc. became a registered 501(c)3 charitable organization in 2002. Founder, Tommy Clark, MD conceived of the idea after playing soccer professionally in Zimbabwe where he witnessed both the devastation of HIV and the fanatical popularity of soccer. Together with a group of friends who had similar experiences, he and co-founders Methembe Ndlovu, [[Ethan Zohn]], and Kirk Friedrich created Grassroot Soccer. The core group traveled to Zimbabwe in 2002 and with the support of advisory board member, Albert Bandura, consultants and local stakeholders, developed and piloted an interactive soccer-themed HIV prevention curriculum that was first implemented in Zimbabwe in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;"History",  "[http://www.grassrootsoccer.org/who-we-are/history/]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the News==
Grassroot Soccer has partnered with corporations and organizations such as the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID), the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]], Nike, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;"Partners", "[http://www.grassrootsoccer.org/partners/" Grassroot Soccer]", August 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; When the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) announced its 20 Football for Hope Centers, it chose Grassroot Soccer to run the first one, located in Khayelitsha, South Africa, a suburb of Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;"Opening of first Football for Hope Centre heralds a new dawn for Khayelitsha", December 5, 2009, "[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/worldwideprograms/releases/newsid=1144491.html#opening+first+football+hope+centre+heralds+dawn+khayelitsha FIFA]", August 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 2010, Grassroot Soccer announced a partnership with [[Women's Professional Soccer]] in their initiative Get Active! which aims to fight childhood obesity throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Grassroot Soccer Named Official Charity Partner", July 13, 2010, "[http://www.womensprosoccer.com/news/press_releases/100713-get-active-grassroot Women's Professional Soccer]", September 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Studies by Stanford University's Children's Health Council, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Cape Town, as well as others, suggest that the GRS curriculum is very effective.&lt;ref&gt;"Proven Results", "[http://www.grassrootsoccer.org/proven-results/ Grassroot Soccer]", August 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A study on GRS published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine concluded, among other things, that "over 90% of the children provided positive attitude responses to the health-education programme".&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Colin W.; Junge, Astrid; Decelles, Jeff; Donald, James; Jankelowitz, Ryan; Dvorak, Jiri, "'Football for Health' - a football-based health-promotion programme for children in South Africa: a parallel cohort study", "[http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/44/8/546.full British Journal of Sports Medicine]", August 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">Infection rates of '''HIV/AIDS in [[Niger]]''' are estimated to be under 1%, low in relation to most of [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|Africa]] and much of the world.

==Prevalence==
2007 estimates put the number of HIV positive Nigeriens at 60,000 or 0.8% of total population, with 4,000 deaths in that year.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ng.html CIA World Factbook, 2009 update, 2007 estimate figures].&lt;/ref&gt;  United Nations estimates in 2008 gave similar figures, giving Niger one of the lowest infection rates on the continent.&lt;ref name=UNoverview&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/CountryResponses/Countries/niger.asp UNAIDS country overview]. Accessed 2009-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

2008 estimates ranged from 44,000 to 85,000 people living with HIV in a nation of around 14 million, with an adult (aged 15 to 49) prevalence rate of between 0.6% and 1.1%.  Adults aged 15 and up living with HIV were estimated to range from 42,000 to 81,000, with women of this age range making up about a third (12,000 to 26,000). Estimates of children (under 14) living with HIV were between 2,500 and 4,200. Total deaths were estimated to be between 3,000 and 5,600 per year. [[Aids orphan]]s (under 17) were estimated at between 18,000 and 39,000.&lt;ref name=UNoverview /&gt;

The government of Niger has coordinated educational campaigns around sexual activity and condom use to stem HIV infection.  Condom use remains low by international standards.&lt;ref name=UNsitanalysis2008&gt;[http://data.unaids.org/pub/FactSheet/2008/sa08_nig_en.pdf Country situation analysis:Niger]. UN Aids Agency (January 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vulnerability to HIV ==
A 2001 study found that Vulnerability to HIV infection is potentially high among a study group in the capital, [[Niamey]].  Infection via sharing personal objects was the most cited vector of HIV transmission, and that little association amongst respondents was made between HIV and sexual activity. Men were less likely than women to recognize the use of condoms as a preventive measure, or that unprotected sex is a risk factor for infection.&lt;ref name="gateway.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;[http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102252923.html U.S. National Institutes of Health abstract]: HIV/AIDS behavioral study in Niger. Chappell C, Didier-Blanchard D, Borwankar R, Thomas L, Hanafi H, Sani M, Vondrasek C; International Conference on AIDS. Int Conf AIDS. 2002 Jul 7-12; 14: abstract no. WePeD6378. AED, Washington, DC, United States&lt;/ref&gt;

While 97% knew what a condom was, only 31% reported ever used a condom, 51% among those self-identified as sexually active. Of the sexually active in the survey, only 57% reported using a condom during their last sexual contact. 60% of those interviewed reported themselves to be sexually active, and the vast majority reported being in a monogamous relationships and perceived a low HIV-risk.&lt;ref name="gateway.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

&lt;!-- using model below: will remove as bits added
==Prevalence==
The first cases of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in [[Mali]] were reported in 1985. While the [[adult]] HIV prevalence was still relatively low at 1.7% according to the 2001 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), it is estimated that HIV prevalence in the general population could triple by 2010 if appropriate prevention measures are not taken immediately.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/mali_05.pdf "Health Profile: Mali"]. [[USAID]] (February 2005). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulnerability to HIV infection in Mali is associated with a variety of factors, such as [[poverty]], poor health conditions, certain cultural practices, and low [[literacy]] levels. [[culture|Cultural]] factors related to HIV vulnerability may include [[male]] dominance of [[women]], the early onset of [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] among [[female|females]], and [[polygamy]], while poverty may result in increased [[prostitution]]. [[Human migration|migration]] is also a significant contributor to HIV infection, as HIV prevalence in neighboring countries such as [[Côte d’Ivoire]] and [[Burkina Faso]] is substantially higher than in Mali. Political and social troubles in countries like Côte d’Ivoire, [[Liberia]], and Sierra Leone are also believed to contribute to increased HIV transmission across borders.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Recorded rates of HIV infection are higher in Malian women than in men, particularly among [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women 25–29 years of age, in whom prevalence is almost 5%. The estimated ratio of HIV-infected young women to young men is 4.5:1. Low [[condom]] use and a high prevalence of [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) are important contributing factors for HIV transmission in Mali. Condom use by young males 15–24 years of age is approximately 30%, but among young females it is as low as 14%. Condom use is also low among other vulnerable populations, such as military personnel, truck drivers, and vendors. A recent survey found that only 12% of women vendors in [[Bamako]] (with an estimated HIV seroprevalence of 6.7%) reported using a condom with their last non-regular partner.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

==National response==
The commitment of the Government of Mali to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment is evident. The National AIDS Program was restructured in 2002, creating the Supreme National Council for AIDS (HCNLS), headed by the [[Amadou Toumani Touré|President of Mali]]; in 2004, an Executive Secretariat was added to the HCNLS to coordinate multisectoral HIV/AIDS-related programming. The National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Control (2001–2005) was developed, and planning for a new strategic plan (2005–2009) has begun; in March 2004, the government signed a national declaration of HIV/AIDS policy.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16408">'''Health blogs''' are [[Niche blogging|niche blogs]] that cover health topics, events and/or related content of the [[Health care industry|health industry]] and the general community.&lt;ref name="www.jmir.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title = JMIR--Examining the Medical Blogosphere: An Online Survey of Medical Bloggers | url = http://www.jmir.org/2008/3/e28/ | accessdate = 13 April 2012|doi = 10.2196/jmir.1118|year = 2008|last1 = Kovic|first1 = Ivor|last2 = Lulic|first2 = Ileana|last3 = Brumini|first3 = Gordana|journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume = 10|issue = 3|pages = e28|pmid = 18812312|pmc = 2626433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A health blog can cover diverse health related concerns such as [[nutrition]] and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[physical fitness|fitness]], [[Obesity|weight control]], [[disease]]s, [[Disease management (health)|disease management]], societal trends affecting health, analysis about health, business of health and health research.

It acts as a [[health education]] platform, where diverse [[user (computing)|user]]s collaborate to seek and/or contribute health content within the standard guidelines.  
Although it is not a requirement, a health blog can be [[interactivity|interactive]], engaging and [[Collaborative blog|collaborative]] with its users in the creation of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boulos | first1 = MNK | last2 = Maramba | first2 = I | last3 = Wheeler | first3 = S | year = 2006 | title = Wikis, blogs and podcasts: a new generation of Web-based tools for virtual collaborative clinical practice and education | url = | journal = BMC Med Educ | volume = 6 | issue = 1| page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A health blog can grow in user size and operate as an [[online community]].&lt;ref name="www.defense.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title = http://www.defense.gov/transformation/articles/2006-06/ta062906b.html | url = http://www.defense.gov/transformation/articles/2006-06/ta062906b.html | accessdate = 13 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Health blogs can be broadly categorized as either a personal '''journal type''' or an '''information site''' type of blog.  There are a wide range of health blog sub-niches that include both journalistic and informative styles.

The most common sub-niches include:
:* '''Weight loss/diet blogs''' offer dieting information or a personal journal of [[weight loss]].
:* '''Nutrition and food blogs''' are more focused on nutritional balance, [[Dietary supplement|supplement]]s and related concerns such as [[Human nutrition|healthy eating]].
:* '''Running blogs '''are often authored by runners who publish their [[running]] experiences, training and related concerns.
:*'''Training and exercise blogs''' publish content about [[physical exercise]] and physical training to teach and provide guidance on exercising.
:* '''Disease and disorder blogs ''' are mainly informational authored by doctors and such professionals. This type of blog often includes further sub-niches dedicated to individual diseases and health conditions.
:* '''Healthy living blogs''' contain information concerned with aspects of a healthy life such as [[wellness (medicine)|wellness]].
:* '''self help blogs''' that focus on emotional well-being.
 
All these categories can have sub-categories dedicated to specific concerns within their niche. Some health blogs do not fall under any of these categories; others could be classified under more than one.

Blogs that only occasionally mention health are not categorised as health blogs, although they may be labeled by the author(s)/owner(s) as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ethical and Legal Issues in Interactive Health Communications: A Call for International Cooperation | pmc = 1761840| volume=2| issue=1| pmid=11720927| doi=10.2196/jmir.2.1.e8| journal=J Med Internet Res| pages=E8| year=2000 | last1 = Rodrigues | first1 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Users==
Health blog users can be broadly categorized into authors and readers.

Started for different reasons, health blogs characterise owners' interest and objectives.&lt;ref name="snurb.info"&gt;{{cite web| title = Uses of Blogs &amp;#124; Snurblog | url = http://snurb.info/index.php?q=UsesOfBlogs | accessdate = 13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually, the owner is the [[author]] who updates its content. The author determines the tone, language, frequency of posting, style of writing and other factors that determine the overall feel and look of the blog.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie HM. Why Bother Blogging? Motivations for Adults in the United States to Maintain a Personal Journal Blog [master's thesis]. Raleigh, NC: North Carolina State University; 2008 65pp.&lt;/ref&gt; More common authors of health blogs include medical professionals, patients and health enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S. C., Scheidt, L. A., Bonus, S., &amp; Wright, E. (2004). Bridging the Gap: A Genre Analysis of Weblogs. In Proceedings of the Thirty-seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS-37) (Ed.), Los Alamitos: IEEE Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers broadly include all those who take time to read content posted on blogs, whether as a member or by chance. They include other professionals, patients and interested individuals. Readers make the audience of the blog and its authors. They directly or indirectly contribute to the health blog through commenting, emailing and such feedback techniques. Readers have been responsible of further disseminating health information by sharing it with their social circles.&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = SH | last2 = Liao | first2 = HL | last3 = Zeng | first3 = YT | year = 2007 | title = Why people blog: an Expectancy Theory analysis | url = | journal = Issues in Information Systems | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 232–237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on the health industry==
The [[health care industry]] consists of [[Health care provider|health providers]] in diverse fields that include [[medicine]], [[dentistry]], [[nursing]], [[Allied health professions|allied health]], [[Unlicensed assistive personnel|assistive personnel]] and varied health practitioners. There is probably a health blog accounting information on each of these fields. Health blogs have offered a platform to [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] to channel developments, research and/or opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Blood, R. (2002). Weblogs: A history and perspective. In J. Rodzvilla (Ed.), We've Got Blog: How Weblogs are Changing Our Culture (pp. 7-16). Cambridge MA: Perseus Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; With each individual in these groups differently receiving, analysing and disseminating information, [[health promotion]] has been diversified and enhanced through personal [[blog]]s and [[website]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rains | first1 = Stephen A | year = 2007 | title = Perceptions of Traditional Information Sources and Use of the World Wide Web to Seek Health Information: Findings from the Health Information National Trend Survey | url = | journal = Journal of Health Communication | volume = 12 | issue = 7| pages = 667–80 | doi=10.1080/10810730701619992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health blogs have transformed how [[Health informatics|health information]] is provided, analysed, presented and used. Blogging has improved the [[communication]] process, how the general public receives understands and reacts to health information.&lt;ref name="www.mlanet.org"&gt;{{cite web| title = http://www.mlanet.org/resources/userguide.html | url = http://www.mlanet.org/resources/userguide.html | accessdate = 13 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Blogs offer targeted users the possibility of easily accessing information real-time and capturing readers reactions through comments, emails and such. They influence, criticise, advice, sell and promote [[health literacy]] and related health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Blogs and Wikis - Use Blogs and Wikis to Do Health and Medical Research | url = http://patients.about.com/od/researchandresources/a/blogswikis.htm | accessdate = 13 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that health blogs will have a considerable long-term influence on the industry as the number of health blogs continue to increase.

===From the reader's standpoint===
Health blogs offer readers a platform to source answers, [[knowledge]], [[opinion]], [[Technical support|support]] and/or [[guide|guidance]] while managing their experience. They have brought together users of similar interest closer to finding whatever health information they seek. With a  health blog being objective, specialising on a category of interest such as [[nutrition]] or weight control, it attracts readers of similar concerns, such as those who seek guidance, answers and such, to participate in the fulfilling their individual objectives and those of the blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = http://www.burstmedia.com/pdf/2008_06_01.pdf | url = http://www.burstmedia.com/pdf/2008_06_01.pdf | accessdate = 13 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike health-focused magazines and television shows, health blogs are able to be updated more frequently, keeping up to date with the new and up-and-coming health related concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = http://www.burstmedia.com/pdf/2007_08_01.pdf | url = http://www.burstmedia.com/pdf/2007_08_01.pdf | accessdate = 13 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The content they publish is also  far more personable and easier to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalichman | first1 = Seth C. | last2 = Weinhardt | first2 = Lance | last3 = Benotsch | first3 = Eric | last4 = DiFonzo | first4 = Kari | last5 = Luke | first5 = Webster | last6 = Austin | first6 = James | year = 2002 | title = Internet Access and Internet Use for Health Information Among People Living with HIV/AIDS | url = | journal = Patient Education and Counseling | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 109–16 | doi=10.1016/s0738-3991(01)00134-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health blogs provide first hand information, as well as information based on real-life occurrences such as cancer or weight loss management, contributed by other users who have faced such predicaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = http://www.burstmedia.com/pdf/2005_03_01.pdf | url = http://www.burstmedia.com/pdf/2005_03_01.pdf | accessdate = 13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When this content is deemed trustworthy, it attracts and engages more readers in health matters.

Depending on which [[Niche market|niche]] a health blog specializes in, it serves as a health education platform, promoting health literacy to its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kamel Boulos | first1 = Maged N. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = Steve | year = 2007 | title = The Emerging Web 2.0 Social Software: An Enabling Suite of Sociable Technologies in Health and Health Care Education | url = | journal = Health Information &amp; Libraries Journal | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 2–23 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-1842.2007.00701.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers gain knowledge, insight, guidance and recommendations from health blogs. As people can share content with other members of community, health blogs promote [[community health]]. People refer others to blogs they deem helpful in accord to the going concern.

They are allowing ordinary people to partake in the larger health industry. Readers share their perspective, their experiences or just their passive thoughts on what the blog publishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cui | first1 = Nan | last2 = Wang | first2 = Tao | last3 = Xu | first3 = Shuang | year = 2010 | title = The Influence of Social Presence on Consumers' Perceptions of the Interactivity of Web Sites | url = | journal = Journal of Interactive Advertising | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 36–49 | doi=10.1080/15252019.2010.10722176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually blogs are created by individuals voicing their experiences, opinion and/or other personal interests. Readers offer their reaction to information posted on health blogs, directly or indirectly influencing the future of the health industry.

===From the author's standpoint===
Blogs are created for several objectives, often stipulated by its authors who usually double-up as its owners.&lt;ref name="Liu"/&gt; An [[author]] could be an individual or an organisation and is expected to regularly update the blog. Content published on the blog can be to influence, criticise, inform, persuade or any other intent of communication. Unlike mainstream magazines and newspapers, which are constricted to what they write, blogs easily facilitate writing about anything that interests their authors, allowing for a more broad spectrum of focused health concerns.

Health blogs allow authors to [[Publishing|publish]] content that is of general information contribution. Authors add their research, opinion and such to the larger wealth of health information.

It could be based on real-life experiences, where the author wants a platform to communicate with others of similar concerns. They give authors, especially of personal health blogs, a platform to voice personal experiences, share and help others with a chronology of health experiences.
 
Other health blogs such as those associated with organisations or governments, pass information to the world about products and services, policies, discoveries and such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = Richard D | year = 2007 | title = Nonprofit Organizations Use of the Internet: A Content Analysis of Communication Trends on the Internet Sites of the Organizations on the Philanthropy 400 | url = | journal = Nonprofit Management &amp; Leadership | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 59–76 | doi=10.1002/nml.171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog acts as a contact point with the general public, communicating the intentions, such as marketing drugs, and/or opinion of the author.&lt;ref name="www.ahrq.gov"&gt;{{cite web| title = Impact of direct-to-consumer advertising on drug use varies depending on the drug, scope of advertising, and culture| url = http://www.ahrq.gov/research/mar09/0309RA16.htm| accessdate = 13 April 2012| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120723054309/http://www.ahrq.gov/research/mar09/0309RA16.htm| archivedate = 23 July 2012| df = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have benefited from the viral spreading of content published within their target users. Health blogs have made it easier for contributory stakeholders to expend intent and/or necessary information to their target [[audience]].

Health blogs have enabled health care stakeholders to create wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, David M. (2010), The New Rules of Marketing and PR: How to Use Social Media, Blogs, News Releases, Online Video, and Viral Marketing to Reach Buyers Directly. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; An author, individual or under organisation, can operate a health blog as an [[Electronic business|online business]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisingerich, Andreas B.; Kretschmer, Tobias (2008). "In E-Commerce, More is More". Harvard Business Review 86 (March): 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; An author, depending on granted administrative roles, can advertise and/or promote products and services for financial gains. Adverts, whether related to content published or not, can be a source of income for the author/administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Advertising health: the case for counter-ads | pmc = 1403454| year=1993| volume=108| issue=6| pmid=8265756| journal=Public Health Rep| pages=716–26 | last1 = Dorfman | first1 = L | last2 = Wallack | first2 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Where the health blog is owned or operated by a business organisation, it acts as the front-end user [[interface (computing)|interface]] directing users to main or back-end sales pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thorbjørnsen | first1 = Helge | last2 = Supphellen | first2 = Magne | last3 = Nysveen | first3 = Herbjørn | last4 = Egil Pedersen | first4 = Per | year = 2002 | title = Building Brand Relationships Online: A Comparison of Two Interactive Applications | url = | journal = Journal of Interactive Marketing | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 17–34 | doi=10.1002/dir.10034}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Health businesses have been known to start blogs to enhance their product and/or service promotion.
An individual author can also do so, promoting self-created products and services or those of [[Affiliate (commerce)|affiliates]]. Some health blogs can be classified as shopping blogs since they directly sell health content, products and services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1815">'''Honeymoon rhinitis''' is a condition in which the sufferer experiences [[nasal congestion]] during sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Monteseirin | first1 = J. | last2 = Camacho | first2 = M.

The condition appears to be genetically determined, and caused by the presence in the nose of erectile tissue which may become engorged during sexual arousal as a side effect of the signals from the [[autonomic nervous system]] that trigger changes in the genitals of both men and women.

A related condition called [[sexually induced sneezing]] also exists, where people sneeze, sometimes uncontrollably, when engaging in or even thinking about sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 December 2008 |title=Sneezing 'can be sign of arousal' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7792102.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=26 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ho–Kaufman–Mcalister syndrome''', also known as the Chen-Kung Ho–Kaufman–Mcalister syndrome, is a rare [[congenital malformation]] syndrome where infants are born with a [[cleft palate]], [[micrognathia]], [[Wormian bones]], [[congenital heart disease]], dislocated [[Hip (anatomy)|hips]], bowed [[fibula]]e, preaxial [[polydactyly]] of the feet, abnormal skin patterns, and most prominently, missing [[tibia]]. The [[etiology]] is unknown. Ho–Kaufman–Mcalister syndrome is named after [[Chen-Kung Ho]], [[R.L. Kaufman]], and [[W.H. Mcalister]] who first described the syndrome in 1975 at [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. It is considered a [[rare disease]] by the [[Office of Rare Diseases]] (ORD) of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">'''Integrated Management of Childhood Illness,''' or IMCI, is a systematic approach to children's health which focuses on the whole child.[http://www.who.int/child-adolescent-health/integr.htm] This means not only focusing on [[curative care]] but also on prevention of disease. The approach was developed by [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] and the [[World Health Organization]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/child/imci/en/|website=WHO IMCI Fact Sheet|publisher=World Health Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Inequalities of Child Health==

Although the annual number of deaths among children less than 5 years old has decreased by almost a third since the 1970s, this reduction has not been evenly distributed throughout the world. According to the 1999 World Health Report, children in low- to middle-income countries are 10 times more likely to die before reaching age 5 than children living in the industrialized world. In 1998, more than 50 countries still had childhood mortality rates of over 100 per 1,000 live births.

Every year more than 10 million children in these countries die before they reach their fifth birthday. Seven in 10 of these deaths are due to acute respiratory infections (mostly pneumonia), diarrhea, measles, malaria, or malnutrition — and often to a combination of these conditions

==Rationale for an Evidence-based Syndromic Approach to Case Management==

Many well-known prevention and treatment strategies have already proven effective for saving young lives. Childhood vaccinations have successfully reduced deaths due to measles. [[Oral rehydration therapy]] has contributed to a major reduction in diarrhea deaths. Effective antibiotics have saved millions of children with pneumonia. Prompt treatment of malaria  has allowed more children to recover and lead healthy lives. Even modest improvements in breastfeeding practices have reduced childhood deaths. Many of these interventions have been summed up into 16 key family practices.

While each of these interventions has shown great success, accumulating evidence suggests that a more integrated approach to managing sick children is needed to achieve better outcomes. Child health programmes need to move beyond single diseases to addressing the overall health and well-being of the child. Because many children present with overlapping signs and symptoms of diseases, a single diagnosis can be difficult, and may not be feasible or appropriate. This is especially true for first-level health facilities where examinations involve few instruments, little or no laboratory tests, and no X-ray.

During the mid-1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with UNICEF and many other agencies, institutions and individuals, responded to this challenge by developing a strategy known as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). Although the major reason for developing the IMCI strategy stemmed from the needs of curative care, the strategy also addresses aspects of nutrition, immunization, and other important elements of disease prevention and health promotion. The objectives of the strategy are to reduce death and the frequency and severity of illness and disability, and to contribute to improved growth and development.

The IMCI clinical guidelines target children less than 5 years old — the age group that bears the highest burden of deaths from common childhood diseases.

[http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/maternal/impac/en/ The World Health Organization (WHO) also published the " Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth (IMPAC)" which included newborn and neonatal care guidelines as a continuum of care for both the mother and child in postnatal period.]

 |title =James Esdaile to James Braid (October 1850).&lt;ref&gt;The only record of this correspondence is that reprinted in Braid (1852), pp.78–80; the parenthetical comments in the square brackets are Braid's, and the three asterisks indicate a passage that had been deleted by Braid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although [[John Elliotson]] had met both [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] and James Esdaile in person; Braid never met Esdaile in person, although they did correspond, on a single occasion. The reply from Esdaile, dated October 1851 – a result of Braid sending some of his works to Esdaile – represents their only known contact. In the section wherein Braid records the correspondence, he described Esdaile as a surgeon "whose firmness of nerve, and dexterity of hand, and scientific skill, in every way stamped him as a man eminently qualified for being a leader in his profession" (p.80).&lt;/ref&gt;
 |quote =&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I shall find much in the books to interest and instruct me, as I did in your first&lt;br&gt;
work on Hypnotism; but I shall not wait to read them before replying to your&lt;br&gt;
communication.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have not seen any of the papers you allude to in the journals; but am glad&lt;br&gt;
to hear that the doctors are, at last, condescending to turn their attention to one&lt;br&gt;
of the most interesting and important subjects ever submitted to the consider-&lt;br&gt;
sideration of the physiologist, the metaphysician, and natural philosopher.***&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Regarding the reality and cause of the mesmeric phenomena, if I venture to&lt;br&gt;
differ from you even, who are so much better prepared to investigate the subject&lt;br&gt;
[than certain individuals to whom the Doctor had referred], it is for reasons which&lt;br&gt;
I hope you will consider worthy your attention. I am fully aware that there are&lt;br&gt;
various modes of inducing the mesmeric symptoms, to a certain extent, without&lt;br&gt;
the probability, or even possibility, of any vital force proceeding from the&lt;br&gt;
operator being concerned in the matter. But I have never (except for experiment)&lt;br&gt;
produced the mesmeric state of the system by the exhaustion of any organ,&lt;br&gt;
such as the eye, [here the Doctor has overlooked the important part which the&lt;br&gt;
mental act of '''fixed attention''' plays in this matter] or by acting strongly on the&lt;br&gt;
imagination, or by any means that could favour self-mesmerization, as you will&lt;br&gt;
perceive from the following '''resumé''' of my practice:—&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;During the last six years I have performed upwards of 300 capital operations&lt;br&gt;
of every description, and many of them of the most terrible nature, without in-&lt;br&gt;
flicting pain on the patients; and, '''in every instance''', the insensibility was&lt;br&gt;
produced in this fashion.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All knowledge of our intentions was, if possible, concealed from the patients;&lt;br&gt;
and if they had never heard of mesmerism and painless operations, so much&lt;br&gt;
the better. They were taken into a darkened room, and desired to lie down and&lt;br&gt;
'''shut their eyes'''. A young Hindoo or Mussulman then seated himself at the&lt;br&gt;
head of the bed, and made passes, without contact, from the head to the&lt;br&gt;
epigastrium, breathing on the head and eyes all the time, and occasionally&lt;br&gt;
resting his hands for a minute on the pit of the stomach. This often induced&lt;br&gt;
the coma deep enough for the severest surgical operation in a few minutes;&lt;br&gt;
but the routine was for me to examine the patient at the end of an hour, and&lt;br&gt;
if he was not ready, the process was repeated daily. Taking the average, the&lt;br&gt;
operation, of whatever description, was usually performed on the fourth or&lt;br&gt;
fifth day.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Probably as many more cases were subjected to the trance for medical&lt;br&gt;
purposes, and were usually treated in the same way, for its convenience to&lt;br&gt;
both parties.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The enclosed remarkable case of clairvoyance, with transference of the&lt;br&gt;
senses to the epigastrium, will show that the mesmeric control of the system&lt;br&gt;
may be obtained, when the patient is not only asleep, but in a state of&lt;br&gt;
'''intense natural coma'''.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have also entranced a blind man, and made him so sensitive, that I could&lt;br&gt;
entrance him '''however employed''', (eating his dinner, for instance) by merely&lt;br&gt;
making him the object of my attention for ten minutes. He would gradually&lt;br&gt;
cease to eat, remain stationary a few moments, and then plunge, head fore-&lt;br&gt;
most, among his rice and curry.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Numbers of madmen have been entranced in the lunatic asylum of Calcutta;&lt;br&gt;
and I performed a mesmeric operation on one man who had cut his throat.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I frequently desired the visitors of my hospitals to pretend to take the&lt;br&gt;
portraits of patients, and to engage their attention as much as possible, by&lt;br&gt;
conversing with them. I then retired to another room, and reduced them to&lt;br&gt;
statues, without the possibility of their suspecting my intentions.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How such phenomena can be accounted for, without presuming the&lt;br&gt;
existence of a physical power transmitted from the operator to the subject,&lt;br&gt;
passes my comprehension. That the mesmeric virtue can be communicated&lt;br&gt;
to inanimate matter, is a physical fact, of which I am as well convinced as&lt;br&gt;
of my own existence. It was my common hospital practice to entrance patients&lt;br&gt;
'''for the purpose of having their sores burned with Nitric Acid''', by giving them&lt;br&gt;
mesmerised water to drink.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Community of taste, and thought-reading, are among the most common of&lt;br&gt;
the higher mesmeric phenomena; and how they are to be explained, except by&lt;br&gt;
the transmission of the operator’s sensations, through his '''thought-stamped''',&lt;br&gt;
nervous fluid, sent to the brain of the subject, I cannot conjecture.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Important, if true", you will probably say. I can only say, that healthy senses,&lt;br&gt;
a natural power of seeing things as they really are, and an earnest desire to&lt;br&gt;
know the truth, whatever it may be, are perfectly useless for the acquisition&lt;br&gt;
of knowledge, if all I have related is not perfectly true.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Till such facts are known to medical men and natural philosophers, it is surely&lt;br&gt;
premature to dogmatise about the '''only''' source of the mesmeric phenomena.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It happened, curiously enough, that the sleeping Faqueer of Lahore had&lt;br&gt;
attracted my attention about the very time your interesting account of him&lt;br&gt;
appeared,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1PQ0AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Braid, J., ''Observations on Trance; or, Human Hybernation'', John Churchill, (London), 1850.]&lt;/ref&gt; and I had actually written to [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Sir Henry Lawrence]], begging him to&lt;br&gt;
procure us information on the subject; but my departure from India, shortly&lt;br&gt;
after, prevented my prosecution of the subject.

'''James Esdaile''', M.D., E.I.C.S, Bengal (1808–1859), a Scottish surgeon, who served for twenty years with the [[East India Company]], is a notable figure in the history of [[mesmerism]].

==Family==
The eldest son of the [[James Esdaile (minister)|Rev. James Esdaile, D.D.]] (1775–1854), a minister of the [[Church of Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/fastiecclesiu04scotuoft#page/n243/mode/1up Scott, H., ''Fasti Ecclesiæ Scoticanæ: The Succession of Ministers in the Church of Scotland from the Reformation, New Edition, Volume IV: Synods of Argyll, and of Perth and Stirling'', Oliver and Boyd (Edinburgh), 1923, p.232].&lt;/ref&gt; and Margaret Blair (1781–1843), he was born in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], Angus, Scotland on 6 February 1808. He died in [[Sydenham|Sydenham, Kent]] on 10 January 1859.

He had three brothers, David Esdaile, D.D. (1811-1880) — an ordained cleric, who, along with James Esdaile (his brother), founded Edinburgh’s '''Ministers’ Daughters’ College''' (later known as '''Esdaile School'''), dedicated to the education of the daughters of Ministers of the Church of Scotland, and of Professors in the Universities of Scotland&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=EAcWAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA303#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Scott, H., ''Fasti Ecclesiæ Scoticanæ: The Succession of Ministers in the Church of Scotland from the Reformation, New Edition, Volume V: Synods of Fife, and of Angus and Mearns'', Oliver and Boyd (Edinburgh), 1925, p.303].&lt;/ref&gt; — John Esdaile (1813-1877) and Robert Esdaile (1816-1882), both of whom migrated to Canada, and one sister, Janet (1818-1819).

He married three times.
* His first wife, Mary Ann Christie, whom he had married on 6 June 1838, whilst on furlough in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=uisYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA285#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marriages, ''The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British and Foreign India, China, and Australasia'', Vol.26, No.104, (August 1838), p.285].&lt;/ref&gt; died on 9 November 1838, "in her 18th year",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-iYoAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Asiatic%20Journal%2C%20January%201839%2C&amp;pg=RA1-PA142#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Deaths, ''The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British and Foreign India, China, and Australasia'', Vol.28, No.110, (February 1839), p.142].&lt;/ref&gt; on their voyage to India (they left England on 24 July 1838).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=x79GAAAAcAAJ&amp;vq=RA1-PA284&amp;pg=RA1-PA284#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Passengers to India: ''Per Duke of Bedford'', ''The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British and Foreign India, China, and Australasia'', Vol.26, No.104, (August 1838), p.284].&lt;/ref&gt;
* His second wife, Sophia Ullmann — daughter of the Delaware banker, John James Ullmann (1754-1811) and Jeanne F.

* He married his third wife, Eliza Morton (1807-1862) (née Weatherhead) in Calcutta on 3 February 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=vnhNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marriages, ''The Indian News'', No.207, (2 April 1851), p.153].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
He studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;The University of Edinburgh was also the alma mater of [[John Elliotson]] and [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]].&lt;/ref&gt; graduating M.D. in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.ed.ac.uk/alumni/record/79363?highlight=ESDAILE Student Record for James Esdaile] -- [[University of Edinburgh]], Centre for Research Collections, Individual Records, Students of Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His 1829 dissertation was titled '''''De Narcoticis''''' ("On Narcotics") (see [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ggYyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''List of the Graduates in Medicine in the University of Edinburgh from MDCCV to MDCCCLXVI'', Neill &amp; Company, (Edinburgh), 1867, p.87]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
In 1830, he was appointed as ''Civil Assistant Surgeon'' to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], and arrived in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[History of Bengal#British rule|Bengal]] (which was, then, the capital of [[British India]]), in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;He appointed on 10 February 1831 (see [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=DlK-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "1193. Esdaile, James", p. 103, in Crawford, D.G., ''Roll of the Indian Medical Service 1615-1930, Volume 1'', London), 1930]), and was taken on strength as an Assistant Surgeon on 20 July 1831 (see [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=z8NGAAAAcAAJ&amp;vq=RA1-PA189&amp;pg=RA1-PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British and Foreign India, China, and Australasia'', Vol.6, No.24, (December 1831), p.189]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Having suffered from chronic [[bronchitis]] and [[asthma]] since his adolescence, Esdaile thought that India's different climate would be of benefit. Five years later, he suffered a total breakdown while working at [[Azamgarh|Azamgarh, in Uttar Pradesh]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=GMtGAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA241#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 27 May (1835), ''The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British and Foreign India, China, and Australasia'', Vol.18, No.72, (December 1835), p.241].&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, was given an extended [[furlough]] from 1836 to 1838.&lt;ref&gt;2 January 1836: "Assist. Surg. James Edaile, M.D., for health" ([https://books.google.com.au/books?id=I7RAAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Furloughs: To Europe, ''The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British and Foreign India, China, and Australasia'', Vol.20, No.78, (June 1836), p.105]).&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he travelled extensively; and his 1839 work, ''Letters from the Red Sea, Egypt, and the Continent'',&lt;ref&gt;Described as "a very entertaining, graphic and lively volume of letters" ([https://books.google.com.au/books?id=V6ceAXAEDLsC&amp;pg=PR8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Miscellaneous Critical Notices, ''The Calcutta Review'', Vol.6, No.12, (1846), p.viii]).&lt;/ref&gt; was written as a result of these travels.

He returned from his furlough to Calcutta, and was soon appointed as ''Civil Surgeon'' to the small Hooghli Imambara Hospital;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xRcYAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=esdaile%2C%20egerton%2C%20littler&amp;pg=RA5-PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Military: By the President in Council", Calcutta Monthly Journal and General Register, (November 1839), p.26: No.16 of 1839].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Hooghly Imambara Hospital … first established as an experimental measure in 1836 … derives its name from the fact that it originally formed a part of the [[Hooghly Imambara]] created out of the Trust Fund left by Haji Muhammad Mohsin": Banerji (1972), p.610.&lt;/ref&gt; and, through this appointment, he was also responsible for the hospital at Hooghly Jail.

From November 1839 to December 1841 Esdaile also served as the Principal of the prestigious [[Hooghly Mohsin College|Hooghly College]],&lt;ref&gt;Although he was unable to establish whether (or not) "the lectures were actually given", Zachariah (1936, p.25) noted that, "in 1842, Dr. Esdaile, although no longer Principal, proposed to give some lectures on Chemistry and Physiology" — Zachariah was citing (see p.133, fn.85) "Extract from ''Proceedings of the Honorable the Vice President in Council in the Revenue Department'' under the date of 20th September 1831".&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Palladian architecture|palladian mansion]] in Chinsurah that had been originally designed and built for [[Pierre Cuillier-Perron|"General Perron"]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dli.ernet.in/bitstream/handle/2015/43687/History-Of-Hooghly-College-1836-1936.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Zachariah, K., ''History of Hooghly College, 1836-1936'', Bengal Government Press, (Alipore), 1936] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412143108/http://www.dli.ernet.in/bitstream/handle/2015/43687/History-Of-Hooghly-College-1836-1936.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |date=12 April 2017 }}, p.14; [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=m7cEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Annual Report of the College of Hadji Mohammud Moshin with its Subordinate Schools; and of the Colleges of Dacca and Kishnaghur, for 1850-51'', F.

He was serving as the ''Registrar of Deeds'' for Hooghly in 1843,&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (1914), pp.137, 153-156.&lt;/ref&gt; and as Secretary of the Hooghly Branch of the [[Agri Horticultural Society of India|Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=4W9AAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Horticultural Exhibition at Hooghly, ''Journal of the Agricultural &amp; Horticultural Society of India'', Vol.2, Part 1, No.8, (August 1843), p.191].&lt;/ref&gt;

He was promoted to ''Presidency Surgeon'' in January 1848,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WhcYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA361#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Medical: Appointments, ''Allen's Indian Mail, and Register of Intelligence for British and Foreign India, China, and All Parts of the East'', Volume 6, No.103, (22 June 1848), p.361]; [https://archive.org/stream/39002011123081.med.yale.edu#page/4/mode/1up Letter from the Marquis of Dalhousie to The Poor Law Guardians of Exeter, 27 June 1856 (Esdaile, 1856, p.4).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A ''Presidency Surgeon'' "under[took] the duty of attending all sick officers, military or civil, stationed at or on leave at the Presidency (viz., the administrative compound of the [[Bengal Presidency]])" (Crawford, 1914, p.10).&lt;/ref&gt; and was further promoted to ''Marine Surgeon'' (serving the [[Royal Indian Navy (1612–1950)|Indian Navy]]) on 29 May 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=KHhNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Government Notifications: Civil and Eccesiastical: Appointments—Permanent, ''The Indian News'', No.167, (31 July 1849), p.226].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesmeric Analgesia==

On 4 April 1845, Esdaile performed his first mesmeric procedure:
:''On 4 April 1845, [Esdaile] was treating a convict afflicted with double [[Hydrocele testis|hydrocele]]. The drainage and injection of one side of the [[scrotum]] caused the patient such pain that Esdaile determined to try mesmerism upon him for the second operation…''
:''he was successful in rendering the convict analgesic, and at once began to experiment with mesmerism both as a means of producing analgesia in surgical cases, and as a method of treatment for medical ones.''&lt;ref name="Gauld 1992, p.223"&gt;Gauld (1992), p.223.&lt;/ref&gt;

By his own admission, Esdaile had never seen a mesmeric act; but, given the level of pain of this specific patient, and the understanding that he had gained from what he had read, it occurred to him that mesmerism might be of great value:
:''Seeing him [the patient] suffering in this way, I turned to the native sub-assistant surgeon, an '''élève''' [student] of the medical college, and asked him if he had ever seen Mesmerism? He said, that he had seen it tried at the medical college, but without effect. Upon which I remarked, "I have a great mind to try it on this man, but as I never saw it practised, and know it only from reading, I shall probably not succeed."''&lt;ref&gt;Esdaile (1846), p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Esdaile did succeed.

As performed by Esdaile, the mesmeric act was an exhausting procedure:
:''Esdaile's method was to make the patient lie down in dark room, wearing only a loin cloth, and [Esdaile would] repeatedly pass the hands in the shape of claws, slowly over the [patient's] body, within one inch of the surface, from the back of the head to the pit of the stomach, breathing gently on the head and eyes all the time [and] he seems to have sat behind the patient, leaning over him almost head to head and to have laid his right hand for extended periods on the pit of the stomach.''&lt;ref&gt;Gauld (1992), p.257.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As a consequence, Esdaile, whose own health was far from good, soon began to delegate this exhausting work which, when necessary, would involve "[having] a patient magnetized for hours each day for ten or twelve days [to his] native assistants, saving his own strength for the performance of surgery".&lt;ref&gt;Gauld (1992), p.223. Esdaile himself speaks of how "''it is exacting too much of human nature to expect people to sweat for hours '''pawing the air''''' (1846, p.11, emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a short time, Esdaile had gained a wide reputation amongst the European and indigenous communities for painless surgery, especially in cases of the scrotal "tumours" that were [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in Bengal at that time&lt;ref&gt;Some of these massive scrotal growths were as large as 112lbs/51kg (Gauld, 1992, p.222).&lt;/ref&gt; due to [[filariasis]] (similar to [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]]) that was transmitted by [[mosquitoes]]. Esdaile's mesmeric anaesthesia was extremely safe:
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''I beg, to state, for the satisfaction of those who have not yet a practical knowledge of the subject, that I have seen no bad consequences whatever arise from persons being operated on when in the mesmeric trance.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cases have occurred in which no pain has been felt subsequent to the operation even; the wounds healing in a few days by the first intention; and in the rest, I have seen no indications of any injury being done to the constitution.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On the contrary, it appears to me to have been saved, and that less constitutional disturbance has followed than under ordinary circumstances.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There has not been a death among the cases operated on.''&lt;ref&gt;Esdaile (1846), p.xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the successes with anaesthesia and his impressive surgical outcomes (exclusively with "native" patients), Esdaile was at a loss to explain these events in the light of his earlier (pre-mesmeric) six years' experience:
:''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Since [my first use of mesmerism in April 1845,] I have had '''every month''' more operations of this kind than take place in the native hospital in Calcutta in a year, and more than I had for the six years previous.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There must be some reason for this, and I only see two ways of accounting for it: my patients, on returning home, either say to their friends  similarly afflicted, "Wah! brother, what a soft man the doctor Sahib is! He cut me to pieces for twenty minutes, and I made him believe that I did not feel it. Isn't it a capital joke? Do go and play him the same trick ; you have only to laugh in your elbow, and you will not feel the pain."&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Or they say to their brother  sufferers, — " Look at me ; I have got rid of my burthen, (of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 80 lbs., as it may be,) am restored to the use of my body, and can again work for my bread: this, I assure you, the doctor Sahib did when I was asleep, and I knew nothing  about it;—you will be equally lucky, I dare say; and  I advise you to go and try; you need not be cut if you feel it."&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Which of these hypotheses best explains the fact my readers will decide for themselves.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It ought to be added, that most of these persons were not paupers, but people in comfortable circumstances,  whom no inducement short of painless operations could tempt to enter a charity, or any other hospital; and all who know the natives are aware of this.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mesmerisminindia00esda#page/218/mode/2up Esdaile (1846), pp.218-219].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Esdaile's work with mesmerism-assisted painless surgery at Hoogly had come to the attention of the Deputy Governor of Bengal, Sir Herbert Maddocks. Maddocks appointed a committee of seven reputable (medical and non-medical) officials to investigate Esdaile's claims. They submitted a positive report (on 9 October 1846), and a small hospital in Calcutta was put at his disposal in November 1846.

By 1848, a mesmeric hospital supported entirely by public subscription was opened in Calcutta especially for Esdaile's work. It was closed 18 months later by the Deputy Governor of Bengal, Sir John Littler:&lt;ref name="Gauld 1992, p.223"/&gt; according to Cotton (1931, p.170), although the Mott's Lane Mesmeric Hospital, opened in 1846, was permanently closed in 1848, Elliotson "continued to practise mesmerism at the Sukeas' Street Dispensary until he left India in 1851".&lt;ref&gt;See also [https://archive.org/stream/b21909635#page/26/mode/2up Webb (1850), pp.26-28].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1848, [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], the [[Governor-General of India]], appointed Esdaile to the position of '''Presidency Surgeon'''; and, in 1849, whilst not supporting the continuation of the mesmeric hospital in Calcutta, Dalhousie had so much respect for Esdaile and his work, that he appointed him to the position of '''Marine Surgeon'''.

Esdaile retired from the British East India Company in 1853, upon the expiration of his 20 years' contract. He became a Vic-President of the London Mesmeric Infirmary,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [https://www.woodlibrarymuseum.org/library/pdf/S_AFKM.pdf ''Report of the Sixth Annual Meeting of the London Mesmeric Infirmary'', Walton &amp; Mitchell, (London), 1855].&lt;/ref&gt; and a Vice-President of the Scottish Curative Mesmeric Association ([https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xQMFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]). After briefly returning to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in Scotland he settled in [[Sydenham]] where he died on 10 January 1859. He is buried at [[West Norwood Cemetery]].

Esdaile is thought by many to have been a pioneer in the use of [[hypnosis]] for surgical [[anaesthesia]] in the era immediately prior to [[James Young Simpson]]'s discovery of [[chloroform]].  However, Esdaile had studied neither hypnotism nor Mesmerism himself.

Although some would trace the practice of [[hypnotherapy]] back to [[Abbé Faria|Faria]], [[History of hypnosis#Valentine Greatrakes and Johann Joseph Gassner|Gassner]], and [[History of hypnosis#Father Maximilian Hell|Hell]], it is conventional to trace what we now know as hypnotism back to the Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]]'s reaction to a public exhibition of mesmeric techniques given by [[Charles Lafontaine]] in Manchester on 13 November 1841

There are some similarities between both the theory and practice of Victorian Mesmerism and hypnotism.  Braid viewed the Bengal Government's report (i.e., Atkinson &amp; O’Shaughnessy (1846)), on Esdaile's use of [[Mesmerism]] in an Indian hospital favourably, although only 30% of Esdaile's clients were entirely pain-free during their operations.&lt;ref name="Braid, 1847, pp. 381-382"&gt;Braid, "Facts and Observations, etc." (1847).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Braid also expressed reservations about Esdaile's claims of supernatural powers possessed by certain subjects, and noted that Esdaile's operations were yet to be demonstrated in British hospitals on British patients.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ''theory'' I entirely differ from Dr. Esdaile.  He is a Mesmerist – that is, he believes in the transmission of some peculiar occult influence from the operator to the patient, as the cause of the subsequent phenomena.&lt;ref name="Braid, 1847, pp. 381-382"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In fact, as this report shows, Esdaile did not generally "Mesmerise" the patients himself but employed native Indian boys to spend 2–8 hours per day with each patient in a darkened room, employing a technique that involved breathing on the patient's body.  The resemblance to the conventional techniques of [[Mesmerism]] is therefore minimal.

== The artificial propagation of salmon == 
Esdaile was a keen [[salmon]] fisherman,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [https://archive.org/details/63721400R.nlm.nih.gov ''Mesmerism in India'', pp.40-41.]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was "at [his] instigation that the proprietors of salmon-fishings on [[River Tay|the Tay]] constructed the artificial breeding beds at [[Stormontfield]]" (Esdaile, 1857), when a letter, written by Esdaile, on the artificial propagation of salmon, "A Plan for Replenishing the River Tay with Salmon",&lt;ref&gt;Carnie (2008/2009), p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; was submitted to a meeting of the proprietors on the Tay on 19 July 1852.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2245492 "Propagation of Salmon", ''The (Hobart) Courier'', (Friday, 21 October 1853), p.3].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1862), especially pp.23-24, 44-47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also, see Esdaile, D. (1865), especially 141-153,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buist (1866), pp.4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1875), pp.7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1875).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atomic Energy Project==
The Atomic Energy Project at the University of Rochester was a graduate teaching program. 
The project had three divisions. [[William Freer Bale]] headed the [[Radiology]] and [[Biophysics]] division that worked largely on radioactive materials—for example, radium, radon, plutonium, and polonium. Stannard was responsible for 2 sections, the Radiation Toxicology section and the Radioautography section. [[Harold Carpenter Hodge|Harold Hodge]] headed the Pharmacology and Toxicology division that focused on Uranium including inhalation studies. Joe W. Howland, M.D. headed the clinically oriented Medical Services division. [[Herbert Mermagen]] worked in the [[Medical Physics]] section was a [[Health physicist|radiological physicist]], known today as a [[health physicist]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Henry A., (27 April 1950) Quarterly Technical Report, 1 January 1950 thru 31 March 1950, Health and Biology UR-116, The University of Rochester, Atomic Energy Project, pp. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rochester Alumni-Alumnae Review, September–October 1946, 30 University Personnel Return from Bikini (Operations Crossroads).

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Ketorolac''', sold under the brand name '''Toradol''' among others, is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) in the family of [[Heterocyclic compound|heterocyclic]] [[acetic acid]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]s, used as an [[analgesic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallinson |first1=Tom |title=A review of ketorolac as a prehospital analgesic |journal=Journal of Paramedic Practice |date=2017 |volume=9 |issue=12 |page=522–526 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321640488 |accessdate=2 June 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vallertand/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDR&gt;{{cite book | title =  Physician's Desk Reference 2017 | pages = S–474–5|publisher = PDR, LLC| location = Montvale, New Jersey | year = 2017 | isbn = 9781563638381| title-link = Physicians' Desk Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a first-generation NSAID.{{sfn | Henry |page = 279}}

&lt;!-- Side effect and mechanisms --&gt;
Ketorolac acts by [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[Biosynthesis|bodily synthesis]] of [[prostaglandin]]s. Ketorolac in its oral ([[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] or [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]]) and [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] ([[Injection (medicine)|injected]]) preparations is a [[racemic mixture]] of both (''S'')-(−)-ketorolac, the active [[isomer]], and (''R'')-(+)-ketorolac.{{sfn | Henry |page = 279}}

&lt;!-- History and culture --&gt;
Ketorolac was developed in 1989 by [[Syntex]] Corp. (now part of [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/roche-bioscience-history/ |title=History of Roche Bioscience – FundingUniverse |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/mtm/ketorolac.html |title=Ketorolac medical facts from |publisher=Drugs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eye drop|eye-drop]] formulation was approved by the FDA in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/mtm/ketorolac-ophthalmic.html |title=Ketorolac ophthalmic medical facts from |publisher=Drugs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intranasal formulation was approved by the FDA in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/sprix.html |title=Sprix Information from |publisher=Drugs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; for short-term management of moderate to moderately severe pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level. As of 2015, the cost for a typical course of medication in the United States is less than [[United States dollar|US$]]25.&lt;ref name=Ric2015&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=Richart |title= Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition |date=2015 |publisher= Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn= 9781284057560 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ketorolac is used for short-term [[pain]] control not lasting longer than five days, and can be administered [[oral medication|orally]], by intramuscular injection, intravenously, and by [[nasal spray]].&lt;ref name=Vallertand/&gt; Ketorolac is initially administered by intramuscular injection or intravenously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallinson |first1=Tom |title=A review of ketorolac as a prehospital analgesic |journal=Journal of Paramedic Practice |date=2017 |volume=9 |issue=12 |page=522–526 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321640488 |accessdate=2 June 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Oral therapy is only used as a continuation from the intramuscular or intravenous starting point.&lt;ref name=Vallertand/&gt;&lt;ref name="MartinJimenez2017"/&gt;

Ketorolac is used during eye surgery to maintain [[mydriasis]], or the 'relaxing' of the iris muscles that will allow surgeons to perform [[cataract]] surgery.&lt;ref name="Saenz-de-ViteriGonzalez-Salinas2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saenz-de-Viteri|first1=Manuel|last2=Gonzalez-Salinas|first2=Roberto|last3=Guarnieri|first3=Adriano|last4=Guiaro-Navarro|first4=María Concepción|title=Patient considerations in cataract surgery &amp;ndash; the role of combined therapy using phenylephrine and ketorolac|journal=Patient Preference and Adherence|volume=Volume 10|year=2016|pages=1795–1801|issn=1177-889X|doi=10.2147/PPA.S90468|pmid=27695298|pmc=5029911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ketorolac is effective in treating ocular itching.&lt;ref name=Karch&gt;{{cite book | last = Karch | first = Amy |page = 272| title = Focus on nursing pharmacology | publisher = Wolters Kluwer | location = Philadelphia | year = 2017 | isbn = 9781496318213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ketorolac ophthalmic formulation is associated with a decreased development of [[macular edema]] after cataract surgery and is more effective alone rather than as an opioid/ketorolac combination treatment.&lt;ref name="LimLim2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=Blanche X|last2=Lim|first2=Chris HL|last3=Lim|first3=Dawn K|last4=Evans|first4=Jennifer R|last5=Bunce|first5=Catey|last6=Wormald|first6=Richard|last7=Wormald|first7=Richard|title=Prophylactic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of macular oedema after cataract surgery|year=2016|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006683.pub3 | pmid = 27801522|volume=11|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|page=CD006683|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1529414/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SivaprasadBunce2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sivaprasad|first1=Sobha|last2=Bunce|first2=Catey|last3=Crosby-Nwaobi|first3=Roxanne|last4=Sivaprasad|first4=Sobha|title=Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for treating cystoid macular oedema following cataract surgery|year=2012|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004239.pub3 | pmid = 22336801|issue=2|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|page=CD004239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ketorolac has also been used to manage pain from [[corneal abrasion]]s.&lt;ref name="Wakai"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wakai A, Lawrenson JG, Lawrenson AL, Wang Y, Brown MD, Quirke M, Ghandour O, McCormick R, Walsh CD, Amayem A, Lang E, Harrison N |title= Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for analgesia in traumatic corneal abrasions |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=5 |pages= CD009781 |date=2017 |pmid= 28516471 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD009781.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During treatment with ketorolac, clinicians monitor for the manifestation of adverse effects and side effects. Lab tests, such as [[liver function tests]], bleeding time, [[BUN]], [[serum creatinine]] and electrolyte levels are often used and help to identify potential complications.&lt;ref name=Vallertand/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDR/&gt;

==Contraindications==
Ketorolac is [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] in those with [[hypersensitivity]], allergies to the medication, cross-sensitivity to other NSAIDs, prior to surgery, history of peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, alcohol intolerance, renal impairment, cerebrovascular bleeding, [[nasal polyps]], [[angioedema]], and [[bronchospasm|asthma]].&lt;ref name=Vallertand/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDR/&gt; Recommendations exist for cautious use of ketorolac in those who have experienced [[cardiovascular disease]], myocardial infarction, stroke, [[heart failure]], [[coagulation]] disorders, [[renal impairment]], and [[hepatic impairment]].&lt;ref name=Vallertand/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDR/&gt;

==Adverse effects==
Though uncommon, potentially fatal adverse effects are [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[GI bleeding]], [[Stevens-Johnson Syndrome]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] and [[anaphylaxis]]. A less serious and more common (&gt;10%) side effect is [[drowsiness]]. Infrequent (&lt;1%) side effects are [[paresthesia]], prolonged [[bleeding time]], [[intramuscular injection|injection]] site pain, [[purpura]], [[sweat]]ing, [[Thought|abnormal thinking]], increased production of [[tears]], [[edema]], [[pallor]], [[dry mouth]], [[Flavor|abnormal taste]], [[urinary frequency]], [[Liver function tests|increased liver enzymes]], [[itching]] and others. Ketorolac can cause premature constriction of the [[ductus arteriosis]] in an infant during the third trimester of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Vallertand/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDR/&gt; Platelet function is decreased related to the use of ketorolac.{{sfn | Henry |page = 279}}

The practice of restricting treatment with ketorolac is due to its potential to cause kidney damage.{{sfn | Henry |page = 280}}

== Interactions ==
Ketorolac can interact with other medications. [[Probenecid]] can increase the probability of having an [[adverse reaction]] or experiencing a [[side effect]] when taken with ketorolac. [[Pentoxifylline]] can increase the risk of bleeding. When aspirin is taken at the same time as ketorolac, the effectiveness is decreased. Problematic GI effects are additive and become more likely if potassium supplements, aspirin, other NSAIDS, [[corticosteroids]], or alcohol is taken at the same time. The effectiveness of antihypertensives and diuretics can be lowered. The use of ketorolac can increase serum lithium levels to the point of toxicity. Toxicity to methotrexate is more likely if ketorolac is taken at the same time. The risk of bleeding increases with the concurrent medications [[clopidogrel]], [[cefoperazone]], [[valproic acid]], [[cefotetan]], [[eptifibatide]], [[tirofiban]], and [[copidine]]. Anticoagulants and thrombolytic medications also increase the likelihood of bleeding. Medications used to treat cancer can interact with ketorolac along with radiation therapy. The risk of toxicity to the kidneys increases when ketorolac is taken with [[cyclosporine]].&lt;ref name=Vallertand/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDR/&gt;

Interactions with ketorolac exist with some [[herbal supplement]]s. ''[[Panax ginseng]]'', [[clove]], [[ginger]], [[arnica]], [[feverfew]], [[dong quai]], [[chamomile]], and ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'', increases the risk of bleeding.&lt;ref name=Vallertand/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDR/&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The primary [[mechanism of action]] responsible for ketorolac's anti-inflammatory, [[antipyretic]] and analgesic effects is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by competitive blocking of the [[enzyme]] [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX). Ketorolac is a non-selective COX inhibitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Lee |first1= I. O. |last2 = Seo |first2= Y. |doi= 10.1213/ane.0b013e318163f602 |title= The Effects of Intrathecal Cyclooxygenase-1, Cyclooxygenase-2, or Nonselective Inhibitors on Pain Behavior and Spinal Fos-Like Immunoreactivity |journal= Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia |volume= 106 |issue=3 |pages= 972–977, table 977 contents |year= 2008 |pmid= 18292448 |pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ketorolac has been assessed to be a relatively higher risk NSAID when compared to aceclofenac, celecoxib, and ibuprofen.&lt;ref name="SchwierTran2016" /&gt;

== History ==
In the US, ketorolac was the only widely available intravenous NSAID for many years; an IV form of [[paracetemol]], which is not an NSAID, became available in Europe in 2009 and then in the US.&lt;ref name="MartinJimenez2017"/&gt;

The [[Syntex]] company, of [[Palo Alto, California]] developed the ophthalmic solution Acular around 2006.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In 2007, there were concerns about the high incidence of reported side effects. This led to restriction in its dosage and maximum duration of use. In the UK, treatment was initiated only in a hospital, although this was not designed to exclude its use in prehospital care and mountain rescue settings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallinson |first1=Tom |title=A review of ketorolac as a prehospital analgesic |journal=Journal of Paramedic Practice |date=2017 |volume=9 |issue=12 |page=522–526 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321640488 |accessdate=2 June 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Dosing guidelines were published at that time.&lt;ref&gt;MHRA Drug Safety Update October 2007, Volume 1, Issue 3, pp 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns over the high incidence of reported side effects with ketorolac trometamol led to its withdrawal (apart from the ophthalmic formulation) in several countries, while in others its permitted dosage and maximum duration of treatment have been reduced. From 1990 to 1993, 97 reactions with a fatal outcome were reported worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Safety of Medicines, Medicines Control Agency: Ketorolac: new restrictions on dose and duration of treatment.

An ocular manifestation of a [[systemic disease]] is an eye condition that directly or indirectly results from a [[disease]] process in another part of the body. There are many diseases known to cause ocular or visual changes. [[Diabetes]], for example, is the leading cause of new cases of [[blindness]] in those aged 20–74, with ocular manifestations such as [[diabetic retinopathy]] and [[macular edema]] affecting up to 80% of those who have had the disease for 15 years or more{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Other diseases such as [[AIDS|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) and [[hypertension]] are commonly found to have associated ocular symptoms.

[[Image:Luis Agote.jpg|thumb|150px|Dr. Luis Agote]]

'''Luis Agote''' (September 22, 1868 – November 12, 1954) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[physician]] and researcher. He was the first to perform a non-direct [[blood transfusion]] using [[sodium citrate]] as an [[anticoagulant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibms.org/go/nm:history-blood-transfusion|title=History of blood transfusion - The Institute of Biomedical Science|website=IBMS|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure took place in Rawson hospital in the city of [[Buenos Aires]] on November 9, 1914. Agote was the first to perform this procedure in [[the Americas]]. Agote worked independently and separately from the [[Belgium|Belgian]] surgeon [[Albert Hustin]], who discovered that sodium citrate in tolerable quantities could anticoagulate blood for transfusion on March 27, 1914.

==Biography==
He studied first in the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]], and then at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], where he was also a teacher. He graduated as a doctor in 1893 with a thesis about suppurative hepatitis. He became Secretary of the National Department of Hygiene in 1894 and became head of the leper hospital in 1895 on the island of Martin Garcia. He was elected Congressman in 1910 and Senator in 1916 of the legislature in Argentina.

==First recorded transfusions==
The first recorded blood transfusion was made between dogs by the English doctor [[Richard Lower (physician)|Richard Lower]] around 1666. In 1667, French scientist Juan Bautista Denys transfused a human with animal blood. In 1900, [[Karl Landsteiner]] identified some of the blood substances responsible for the agglutination of red blood cells, identifying blood groups for the first time and some of their incompatibilities.
[[Image:Agote 1a transfusión.jpg|thumb|240px|Dr. Luis Agote (''2nd from right'') overseeing one of the first safe and effective blood transfusion in 1914]]
Direct transfusions were still not practiced at the beginning of the 20th century because it was impossible to keep unaltered blood outside the body for later use. After 6–12 minutes, coagulation begins manifested initially by a gradual increase of [[viscosity]] that terminates with almost complete solidification. [[Coagulation]] is the defense of an organism to staunch wounds and minimize hemorrhages. Now we know that clotting is almost totally formed by platelets fastened by a network of filaments of [[fibrin]].

Fibrin does not normally exist in blood and is created from protein plasma by the action of the [[thrombin]] enzyme. Similarly, thrombin is not naturally present in blood and is created by the precursor substance prothombrin, in a process that involves platelets, some exiting from calcium and substances produced by lesioned materials. Since clots are not created if there is a lack of some of these elements, the addition of [[sodium citrate]] (which eliminates calcium ions from blood) prevents its formation.

A '''micromort''' (from [[micro-]] and [[Wikt:mortality|mortality]]) is a unit of [[risk]] defined as one-in-a-million chance of [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Fry AM, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26747014 Micromorts—what is the risk?]. 2016-02. Accessed 2016-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker KF, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521517 The dangers of the day of birth]. 2014-05. Accessed 2016-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A '''microprobability''' is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. The micromort concept was introduced by [[Ronald A. Howard]] who pioneered the modern practice of [[decision analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York
 |isbn=0306405547 |year=1980
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micromorts for future activities can only be rough assessments as specific circumstances will always have an impact.  However past historical rates of events can be used to provide a ball-park, average figure.

== Value of a micromort ==

=== Willingness to pay ===
An application of micromorts is measuring the value that humans place on risk: for example, one can consider the amount of money one would [[willingness to accept|have to pay a person to get him or her to accept]] a one-in-a-million chance of death (or conversely the amount that someone might be [[willingness to pay|willing to pay]] to avoid a one-in-a-million chance of death). When put thus, people claim a high number but when inferred from their day-to-day actions (e.g., how much they are willing to pay for safety features on cars) a typical value is around $50 (in 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However utility functions are often not linear, i.e. the more a person has already spent on their safety the less they are willing to spend to further increase their safety. Therefore, the $50 valuation should not be taken to mean that a human life (1 million micromorts) is valued at $50,000,000. Furthermore, the local linearity of any utility curve means that the micromort is useful for small incremental risks and rewards, not necessarily for large risks.&lt;ref name="russell"/&gt;

=== Value of a statistical life ===
Government agencies use a nominal Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) – or Value for Preventing a Fatality (VPF) – to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of expenditure on safeguards.  For example, in the UK the VSL stands at £1.6 million for road improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Transport
GMH, United Kingdom, "TAG Unit 3.4: The Safety Objective", Transport  
Analysis Guidance—WebTAG http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/documents/expert/unit3.4.1.php&lt;/ref&gt; Since road improvements have the effect of lowering the risk of large numbers of people by a small amount, the UK Department of Transport essentially prices a reduction of 1 Micromort at £1.60 (US$2.70). The US Department of Transportation uses a VSL of US$6.2 million, pricing a Micromort at US$6.20.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Transportation, "Treatment of the Economic Value of a Statistical Life in Departmental Analyses—2011 Interim Adjustment", 2011, http://www.dot.gov/policy/transportation-policy/treatment-economic-value-statistical-life&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronic risks==

Micromorts are best used to measure the size of ''acute'' risks, i.e. immediate deaths.  Risks from lifestyle, exposure to air pollution and so on are ''chronic'' risks, in that they do not kill straight away, but reduce life expectancy.  Ron Howard included such risks in his original 1979 work,&lt;ref name="howard" /&gt; for example an additional one micromort from …

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6869">The '''National Child Development Study''' ('''NCDS''') is a continuing, multi-disciplinary [[longitudinal study]] which follows the lives of 17,415 people born in England, Scotland and Wales from 17,205 women during the week of 3–9 March 1958.  The results from this study helped reduce infant mortality and were instrumental in improving maternity services in  the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Power|first=Chris|last2=Elliott|first2=Jane|date=2006-02-01|title=Cohort profile: 1958 British birth cohort (National Child Development Study)|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/1/34|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=34–41|doi=10.1093/ije/dyi183|issn=0300-5771|pmid=16155052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origins of the NCDS can be found in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=736&amp;sitesectiontitle=Perinatal+Mortality+Survey+(1958)|title=Perinatal Mortality Survey (1958) - Centre for Longitudinal Studies|website=www.cls.ioe.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328202035/http://www.wellbeingofwomen.org.uk/research/national-birthday-trust-fund/|title=Wellbeing of Women|date=28 March 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and set up to collect information about the social and [[obstetric]] factors associated with [[stillbirth]] and death in early infancy.&lt;ref name = UKDS&gt;[http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=6137&amp;type=Data%20catalogue Catalogue - National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009], UK Data Service, University of Essex, retrieved September 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCDS was first led by the paediatrician Neville Butler assisted by the National Birthday Trust Fund. The survey was initially planned as a one-off study to investigate the reasons for the relatively high rate of stillbirths (38.5 stillbirths per 1,000 births) in the UK compared to other developed countries.  98% of women (17,205) who gave birth in England, Scotland and Wales to 17,415 babies during the week of 3–9 March 1958 completed the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records of birth deaths to 7,618 women and about 5,000 autopsy reports were also collected over the period of March-May 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 the Plowden Committee which was investigating the education of primary children in the UK and the transition to secondary school, commissioned a follow-up report on the children from the NCDS. This follow-up survey was led by Mia Kellmer Pringle and attempts were made to trace all members of this birth [[generational cohort]]. The survey took place in 1965 and results were included in the [[Plowden report]] ''Children and their Primary Schools'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016 the NCDS has been conducted in nine different sweeps to get information concerning the physical, educational and social development of the people from the initial survey: in 1965, 1969, 1974, 1981, 1991, 1999–2000, 2004, 2008 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;(2015) [http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=2000032  Series - National Child Development Study], United Kingdom Data Service, University of Essex, retrieved June 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The following sweep was planned for 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of topics which have been included are medical care, health, home environment, educational progress, parental involvement, family relationships, economic activity, income, training and housing.&lt;ref name = UKDS/&gt; During the period 2002–2004, genetic information on participants was also obtained to examine the genetic effects on common traits and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b58cgene.sgul.ac.uk/followup.php|title=2002-2004 Biomedical follow-up, retrieved January 6th, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the initial birth survey, the four subsequent sweeps were carried out by the [[National Children's Bureau]]. In 1985, the NCDS was moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU), which in 2016 was known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk|title=Centre for Longitudinal Studies - CLS - Home of the 1958 National Child Development Study, the 1970|website=www.cls.ioe.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CLS).&lt;ref name = UKDS/&gt;

==Methodology and scope==
In the 2013–2014 sweep data collection involved a sequential mixed mode approach&lt;ref&gt;de Leeuw, Edith D,  (2010) [http://www.surveypractice.org/index.php/SurveyPractice/article/view/150/html Mixed-Mode Surveys and the Internet], Survey Practice, American Association for Public Opinion Research, Volume 3, Number 6, retrieved June 15, 2015 &lt;/ref&gt; whereby cohort members were invited to complete a web survey and those not responding were invited to participate via telephone. More than 9,100 cohort members took part in total, with 60% doing so on-line.&lt;ref name = UKDS/&gt;

==Survey results==
{{Asof|2016}}, the results of the NCDS have been used in over 2,500 publications,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which can be found [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/bibliography here]. The report ''Now we are 50'' with the key findings of the NCDS was published by the CLS on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the NCDS in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Jane and Vaitilinham, Romes (2008) [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/shared/get-file.ashx?id=498&amp;itemtype=document Now we are 50 - Key findings from the National Child Development Study], Centre for Longitudinal Studies, London, UK, Retrieved 30 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-using the data==
The data and additional study information are available on the [[United Kingdom Data Service]] (UKDS) website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukdataservice.ac.uk/get-data/key-data/cohort-and-longitudinal-studies.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Users are required to register&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esds.ac.uk/aandp/access/login.asp&lt;/ref&gt; in order to access the download section.

These include opposition to [[austerity]] and a call for political reform.&lt;ref name=bbc2015nhaparty&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-england-32379085 |title=Election 2015: NHA Party 'serious about fixing the NHS'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having stood candidates in local and European parliamentary elections in 2014, the party contested 12 seats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. Surgical registrar Dr Alex Ashman was elected as the party's leader in December 2016 following the resignation of co-founder [[Clive Peedell]] earlier that year.&lt;ref name=nhaballot/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i3935 |title=National Health Action Party gets interim leader after founder resigns &amp;#124; The BMJ |format= |work= |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Alex_Ashman,_Iain_Maclennan_and_Clive_Peedell_in_Eastleigh_Feb_2013.jpg|thumb|Alex Ashman (left), Iain Maclennan (center) and Clive Peedell (right) campaigning during the 2013 [[Eastleigh by-election, 2013|Eastleigh by-election]].]]
The passage of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|Health and Social Care Act]] in March 2012 prompted the party's co-founder [[Clive Peedell]], a cancer specialist doctor, to co-write an open letter to ''[[The Independent]]'' alongside esteemed medical signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/letters/ios-letters-medics-launch-national-campaign-7576235.html|title=IoS letters: Medics launch national campaign|date=18 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was highly critical of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] for their role in the passage of the Act and stated that the signatories would "form a coalition of healthcare professionals to take on coalition MPs at the next General Election, on the non-party, independent ticket of defending the NHS and acting in the wider public interest". Two months later, on 14 May 2012, Peedell co-founded the NHA Party with retired doctor [[Richard Taylor (British politician)|Richard Taylor]], who had twice been elected as MP for [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]] on an 'independent health' component to his local hospital party name.&lt;ref name=leadnew&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18062726 |title=Former MP to lead new political party opposed to NHS changes |publisher=bbc.co.uk |work=BBC News|date=14 May 2012 |accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was launched in [[Westminster]] in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-london-20350906/doctors-launch-national-health-action-party-in-london|title=Doctors launch National Health Action party in London|date=15 November 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party first stood in the 2013 [[Eastleigh by-election, 2013|Eastleigh by-election]], with candidate Dr Iain Maclennan taking 392 votes.&lt;ref name=eastleigh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21625726 |title=Eastleigh by-election: Lib Dems hold on despite UKIP surge |publisher=bbc.co.uk |work=BBC News|date=1 March 2013|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party went on to stand in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European Parliament elections]] and the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 General Election]], taking over 20,000 votes in each. This placed the party seventh in the popular vote in England in the latter.&lt;ref name=bbcelection2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results|title=Results of the 2015 General Election - Election 2015|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's best result to date was the 7,211 votes taken by Dr Richard Taylor in [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]] in 2015 (he had been the MP from 2001 to 2010 under the label [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14001058 |title=Wyre Forest Parliamentary constituency |publisher=bbc.co.uk |work=BBC News|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Party co-founder Dr Clive Peedell resigned the leadership in July 2016, and Dr Paul Hobday was appointed as interim leader.&lt;ref name="bmj"/&gt; Surgical registrar Dr Alex Ashman was elected as the new permanent party leader in December 2016&lt;ref name=nhaballot/&gt; and promised to continue the work begun by Drs Peedell and Taylor.&lt;ref name=nhaxmas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nhaspace.com/2016/12/24/christmas-message-from-the-national-health-action-party/ |title=Christmas message from the National Health Action Party |date=24 December 2016 |accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[philosopher of science]] and [[philosophy of medicine|medicine]] Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a [[science]], using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the [[concept]]s employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the [[ethics|normative]] questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015).

[[File:Black rot lifecycle.tif|thumb|upright=1.3|Life cycle of the black rot pathogen, ''Xanthomonas campestris'' pathovar ''campes'']]
'''Plant pathology''' (also '''phytopathology''') is the scientific study of [[disease]]s in [[plant]]s caused by [[pathogen]]s (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Agrios, George N. |title=Plant Pathology |edition=3rd |publisher=Academic Press |date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms that cause infectious disease include [[fungus|fungi]], [[oomycetes]], [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[plant virus|viruses]], [[viroid]]s, [[virus]]-like organisms, [[phytoplasmas]], [[protozoa]], [[nematode]]s and [[parasitic plant]]s. Not included are ectoparasites like [[insects]], [[mites]], [[vertebrate]], or other [[Plant defense against herbivory|pests that affect plant health]] by consumption of plant tissues. Plant pathology also involves the study of pathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact, [[plant disease epidemiology]], [[plant disease resistance]], how plant diseases affect humans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases.

== Overview ==
{{See also|Morphological symptoms of plant diseases}}
Control of plant diseases is crucial to the reliable production of food, and it provides significant reductions in agricultural use of land, water, fuel and other inputs.  Plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent disease resistance, but there are numerous examples of devastating plant disease impacts such as [[Irish potato famine]] and [[chestnut blight]], as well as recurrent severe plant diseases like [[rice blast]], [[soybean cyst nematode]], and [[citrus canker]].  However, disease control is reasonably successful for most crops. Disease control is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as [[crop rotation]], use of pathogen-free seed, appropriate planting date and plant density, control of field moisture, and [[pesticide]] use. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings.  Continuing advances in the science of plant pathology are needed to improve disease control, and to keep up with changes in disease pressure caused by the ongoing evolution and movement of plant pathogens and by changes in agricultural practices. Plant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] estimates indeed that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss. To solve this issue, new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and [[spectroscopy]] and [[biophotonics]] that are able to diagnose plant health and [[metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Advanced methods of plant disease detection.

=== Fungi ===
Most phytopathogenic fungi belong to the [[Ascomycetes]] and the [[Basidiomycetes]].
The fungi reproduce both [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] and [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] via the production of [[spores]] and other structures. Spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or they may be soilborne. Many soil inhabiting fungi are capable of living [[saprotroph]]ically, carrying out the part of their life cycle in the [[soil]]. These are facultative saprotrophs.
Fungal diseases may be controlled through the use of [[fungicides]] and other agriculture practices. However, new [[Race (biology)|races]] of fungi often [[evolution|evolve]] that are resistant to various fungicides.
Biotrophic fungal pathogens colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living host cells. [[Necrotroph]]ic fungal pathogens infect and kill host tissue and extract nutrients from the dead host cells. Significant fungal plant pathogens include:{{cn|date=July 2017}}

* ''[[Armillaria]]'' spp. (honey fungus species, virulent pathogens of trees)

=== Fungus-like organisms ===

==== Oomycetes ====
The [[oomycetes]] are fungus-like organisms.&lt;ref name="watermold" /&gt; They include some of the most destructive plant pathogens including the [[genus]] ''[[Phytophthora]]'', which includes the causal agents of [[Phytophthora infestans|potato late blight]]&lt;ref name="watermold" /&gt; and [[sudden oak death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/mpp.12190| title=The Top 10 oomycete pathogens in molecular plant pathology| journal=Molecular Plant Pathology| pages=413–434| year=2015| last1=Kamoun | first1=S. | last2=Furzer | first2=O. | last3=Jones | first3=J.

Despite not being closely related to the fungi, the oomycetes have developed similar infection strategies. Oomycetes are capable of using effector proteins to turn off a plant's defenses in its infection process.&lt;ref name="enter host cell"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news199007038.html | title=Scientists discover how deadly fungal microbes enter host cells | publisher=Physorg | work=(VBI) at Virginia Tech affiliates | date=July 22, 2010 | accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant pathologists commonly group them with fungal pathogens.

Significant oomycete plant pathogens include:
* ''[[Pythium]]'' spp.
* ''[[Phytophthora]]'' spp., including the potato blight of the [[Great Irish Famine]] (1845–1849)

==== Phytomyxea ====
Some [[slime mold]]s in [[Phytomyxea]] cause important diseases, including [[club root]] in cabbage and its relatives and [[powdery scab]] in potatoes. These are caused by species of ''[[Plasmodiophora]]'' and ''[[Spongospora]]'', respectively.

=== Bacteria ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bacterial Plant Pathogen]] --&gt;
[[File:Agrobacteriumgall.jpg|thumb|Crown gall disease caused by [[Agrobacterium]]|left]]
Most [[bacteria]] that are associated with plants are actually [[saprotrophic]] and do no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 known species, are able to cause disease.&lt;ref name=JacksonRW&gt;{{cite book | author=Jackson RW (editor). | title=Plant Pathogenic Bacteria: Genomics and Molecular Biology | publisher=Caister Academic Press | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-904455-37-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial diseases are much more prevalent in [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] regions of the world.

Most plant pathogenic bacteria are rod-shaped ([[Bacteria#Morphology|bacilli]]). In order to be able to colonize the plant they have specific pathogenicity factors. Five main types of bacterial pathogenicity factors are known: uses of cell wall–degrading enzymes, [[toxins]], effector proteins, [[phytohormones]] and [[exopolysaccharide]]s.

Pathogens such as ''[[Erwinia]]'' species use cell wall–degrading enzymes to cause [[Bacterial soft rot|soft rot]]. ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' species change the level of [[auxin]]s to cause tumours with phytohormones. [[Exopolysaccharide]]s are produced by bacteria and block [[xylem]] vessels, often leading to the death of the plant.

Bacteria control the production of [[pathogenicity factors]] via [[quorum sensing]].

[[File:Vitis vinifera phytoplasma.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vitis vinifera]] with "Ca. Phytoplasma vitis" infection]]
Significant bacterial plant pathogens:
* [[Burkholderia]]&lt;ref name="abstract bacteria"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Bacteria as Plant Pathogens | publisher=Cornell University | date=October 1948 | author=Burkholder | journal=Annual Review of Microbiology | doi=10.1146/annurev.mi.02.100148.002133 | volume=2 | pages=389–412 | pmid=18104350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas ====
{{Main|phytoplasma}}
''[[Phytoplasma]]'' and ''[[Spiroplasma]]'' are genera of bacteria that lack cell walls and are related to the [[mycoplasmas]], which are human pathogens. Together they are referred to as the [[mollicutes]]. They also tend to have smaller [[genomes]] than most other bacteria. They are normally transmitted by sap-sucking [[insects]], being transferred into the plant's [[phloem]] where it reproduces.
[[File:Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms tobacco.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tobacco mosaic virus]]]]

=== Viruses, viroids and virus-like organisms ===
{{Main|Plant Virus}}
There are many types of [[plant virus]], and some are even [[asymptomatic]]. Under normal circumstances, plant viruses cause only a loss of [[crop yield]]. Therefore, it is not economically viable to try to control them, the exception being when they infect [[perennial plant|perennial]] species, such as fruit trees.

Most plant viruses have small, single-stranded [[RNA]] [[genome]]s. However some plant viruses also have double stranded [[RNA]] or single or double stranded [[DNA]] genomes. These genomes may encode only three or four [[proteins]]: a [[replicase]], a coat protein, a [[movement protein]], in order to allow cell to cell movement through [[plasmodesmata]], and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector. Plant viruses can have several more proteins and employ many different molecular translation methods.

Plant viruses are generally transmitted from plant to plant by a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], but mechanical and seed transmission also occur. Vector transmission is often by an [[insect]] (for example, [[aphid]]s), but some [[fungus|fungi]], [[nematode]]s, and [[protozoa]] have been shown to be viral vectors. In many cases, the insect and virus are specific for virus transmission such as the [[beet leafhopper]] that transmits the [[curly top]] virus causing disease in several crop plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Creamer|first=Rebecca |author2=H. Hubble |author3=A. Lewis|title=Curtovirus Infection of Chile Pepper in New Mexico|journal=Plant Diseases|date=May 2005|volume=89|issue=5|pages=480–486|doi=10.1094/PD-89-0480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nematodes ===
{{Main|Nematodes}}
[[File:Nematode nodules.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Root-knot nematode]] galls|left]]
[[Nematodes]] are small, multicellular wormlike animals. Many live freely in the soil, but there are some species that parasitize plant [[root]]s. They are a problem in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions of the world, where they may infect [[crops]]. Potato cyst nematodes (''Globodera pallida'' and ''G. rostochiensis'') are widely distributed in Europe and North and South America and cause {{Nowrap|$300 million}} worth of damage in Europe every year. Root knot nematodes have quite a large host range, they parasitize plant root systems and thus directly affect the uptake of water and nutrients needed for normal plant growth and reproduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huynh|first=Bao-Lam|last2=Matthews|first2=William C.|last3=Ehlers|first3=Jeffrey D.|last4=Lucas|first4=Mitchell R.|last5=Santos|first5=Jansen R.

Nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to facilitate their lifestyle.

=== Protozoa and algae ===
There are a few examples of plant diseases caused by [[protozoa]] (e.g., ''[[Phytomonas]]'', a [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastid]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jankevicius, J.V. et al. [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0074-02761988000500073&amp;script=sci_arttext Ciclo biológico de ''Phytomonas'' / Biological cycle of ''Phytomonas'']. ''Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz'',  Rio de Janeiro, v. 83, supl. 1, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; They are transmitted as durable [[zoospore]]s that may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years. Further, they can transmit plant [[viruses]]. When the motile zoospores come into contact with a [[root hair]] they produce a plasmodium which invades the [[root]]s.

Some colourless parasitic [[algae]] (e.g., ''[[Cephaleuros]]'') also cause plant diseases.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

=== Parasitic plants ===
Parasitic plants such as [[mistletoe]] and [[Cuscuta|dodder]] are included in the study of phytopathology. Dodder, for example, is used as a conduit either for the transmission of viruses or virus-like agents from a host plant to a plant that is not typically a host or for an agent that is not graft-transmissible.

== Common pathogenic infection methods ==
* '''Cell wall-degrading enzymes''': These are used to break down the plant [[cell wall]] in order to release the nutrients inside.
* '''[[Toxins]]''': These can be non-host-specific, which damage all plants, or host-specific, which cause damage only on a host plant.
* '''Effector proteins''': These can be secreted into the extracellular environment or directly into the host cell, often via the [[Type three secretion system]]. Some effectors are known to suppress host defense processes. This can include: reducing the plants internal signaling mechanisms or reduction of phytochemicals production.&lt;ref name="effector"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newsroom.ucr.edu/2587 | title=How do plants fight disease?

== Physiological plant disorders ==
{{Main|Physiological plant disorders}}

Abiotic disorders can be caused by natural processes such as [[drought]], [[frost]], [[snow]] and [[hail]]; [[flood]]ing and poor drainage; [[Micronutrient deficiency|nutrient deficiency]]; deposition of mineral salts such as [[sodium chloride]] and [[gypsum]]; [[wind]]burn and breakage by storms; and [[wildfire]]s. Similar disorders (usually classed as abiotic) can be caused by human intervention, resulting in [[soil]] compaction, [[pollution]] of air and soil, [[Soil salinity#Salinity due to irrigation|salinisation caused by irrigation]] and road salting, over-application of [[herbicide]]s, clumsy handling (e.g. lawnmower damage to trees), and [[vandalism]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

{{Further information|Pest control|Antagonism (phytopathology)}}
;Quarantine: A diseased patch of vegetation or individual plants can be isolated from other, healthy growth. Specimens may be destroyed or relocated into a greenhouse for treatment or study. Another option is to avoid the introduction of harmful nonnative organisms by controlling all human traffic and activity (e.g., [[The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service|AQIS]]), although legislation and enforcement are crucial in order to ensure lasting effectiveness.
;Cultural: Farming in some societies is kept on a small scale, tended by peoples whose culture includes farming traditions going back to ancient times. (An example of such traditions would be lifelong training in techniques of plot terracing, weather anticipation and response, fertilization, grafting, seed care, and dedicated gardening.) Plants that are intently monitored often benefit from not only active external protection but also a greater overall vigor. While primitive in the sense of being the most labor-intensive solution by far, where practical or necessary it is more than adequate.
;Plant resistance: Sophisticated agricultural developments now allow growers to choose from among systematically cross-bred species to ensure the greatest hardiness in their crops, as suited for a particular region's pathological profile. Breeding practices have been perfected over centuries, but with the advent of genetic manipulation even finer control of a crop's immunity traits is possible. The engineering of food plants may be less rewarding, however, as higher output is frequently offset by popular suspicion and negative opinion about this "tampering" with nature.
;Chemical: (See: [[pesticide application]]) Many natural and synthetic compounds can be employed to combat the above threats. This method works by directly eliminating disease-causing organisms or curbing their spread; however, it has been shown to have too broad an effect, typically, to be good for the local ecosystem. From an economic standpoint, all but the simplest natural additives may disqualify a product from "organic" status, potentially reducing the value of the yield.
;Biological: [[Crop rotation]] may be an effective means to prevent a parasitic population from becoming well-established, as an organism affecting leaves would be starved when the leafy crop is replaced by a tuberous type, etc. Other means to undermine parasites without attacking them directly may exist.
;Integrated: The use of two or more of these methods in combination offers a higher chance of effectiveness.

== History ==
{{further|Timeline of plant pathology}}

Plant pathology has developed from antiquity, starting with [[Theophrastus]], but scientific study began in the [[Early Modern]] period with the invention of the [[microscope]], and developed in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Ainsworth&gt;{{cite book | author=Aisnworth, G.C. | title=Introduction to the History of Plant Pathology |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1981 | isbn=0-521-23032-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prostitution in France''' (the exchange of sexual acts for money) was legal until April 2016, but several surrounding activities were illegal, like operating a [[brothel]], living off the avails ([[procuring (prostitution)|pimping]]), and paying for sex with someone under the age of 18 (the [[age of consent]] for sex is 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25802279|title=Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema on trial over prostitute|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 2016, the French National Assembly voted to punish customers of prostitutes by a fine of €1500.&lt;ref name="law16"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2016/04/06/prostitution-le-parlement-adopte-definitivement-la-penalisation-des-clients_4897216_3224.html Prostitution : le Parlement adopte définitivement la pénalisation des clients] 'Le Monde', accessed 7 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Napoleonic era]], France became the model for the regulatory approach to prostitution. In the 20th century, however, a policy shift became apparent. Brothels became illegal in 1946, and France signed the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] in 1960. France thus became a major supporter of the international abolitionist movement for the eradication of prostitution (see [[#Abolitionism in France|Abolitionism in France]]).

The history of '''prostitution in France''' is similar to that in other European countries, with alternating periods of tolerance and repression (''Tolérance générale, répression occasionnelle''), but is marked by the length of time during which the ''maisons'' (brothels) were tolerated. Prostitutes were not marginalized, but integrated into society where they had a role to play. In stories (which were often ribald), prostitutes would be complicit with other women in avenging men. The great [[Cathedral of Chartres]] had a window endowed by prostitutes (The Prodigal Son) in the same way as other windows were endowed by various other trade guilds (The Trade Windows).&lt;ref&gt;Madeline H.

=== Early period ===
After the period of [[Roman Gaul|Roman rule]], the [[Visigoth]] monarch [[Alaric II]] (485-507 AD) seems to be the first French ruler to prosecute prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Effinger|first1=John R.|title=Women of the Romance Countries|date=1908|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=9781465577481|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zeVf2_d8BOQC&amp;pg=PT87&amp;lpg=PT87&amp;dq=Alaric+II+prostitution#v=onepage&amp;q=Alaric%20II%20prostitution&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===
During the [[Middle Ages]], the various authorities, civil or noble, oversaw prostitution as an institution. Regulation was largely at the municipal level, restricting activity on certain streets, travel, liaisons, required distinctive dress (gold belts, or ''ceinture dorée'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fabula.org/colloques/document939.php Véronique Bui. "Le châle jaune des prostituées au XIXe siècle : signe d'appartenance ou signe de reconnaissance?". ''Fabula''; Feb 7 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
and opening hours of the ''maisons'' (10-6, or 10-8 in Paris).

[[Charlemagne]] (768-814 AD) was amongst those rulers who attempted to suppress prostitution, declaring flogging (300 lashes) as a punishment in his [[capitularies]]. This was primarily aimed at the common man, since harems and concubines were common amongst the ruling classes. Some idea of the seriousness with which the state regarded the offense is provided by the fact that 300 lashes was the severest sentence prescribed by the [[Breviary of Alaric|Code Alaric]]. Offenders also had their hair cut off, and in the case of [[recidivism]], could be sold as slaves. There is no evidence that any of this was effective.&lt;ref name=prosmoy/&gt;&lt;ref name=histmais/&gt;
Under [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] (1180-1223) an irregular militia, the ''[[:fr:Ribaud|Ribaud]]'' were created in 1189 to police prostitution and gambling, headed by a ''Roi des Ribauds'', but abolished by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (1285-1314) due to their licentiousness.

==== Saint Louis IX (1226-1270) ====
In the interim, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (1226-1270) attempted to ban prostitution in December 1254, with disastrous social consequences and widespread protests. The decree ordered the expulsion of all "women of evil life" from the kingdom and confiscation of their belongings, but simply drove the trade underground. Eventually he was forced to revoke this by 1256. Although still railing against women who were "free with their bodies and other common harlots", he acknowledged the pragmatic desirability of housing them away from respectable streets and religious establishments, and so obliged them to reside outside of the borders of the city walls. &lt;!--This is not true: Hence brothels came to be known as "bordels" (or "bordes", or "bordeau"), and the inhabitants as "filles bordelières". In fact, "bordel" derives from "borde", meaning "little cabin made of wood" --&gt; His resolve to do away with prostitution was affirmed in a letter of 1269 to the regents, as he set out on the [[Eighth Crusade]], in which he refers to the need to extirpate the evil, root and branch. The punishment for infraction was an 8 [[French sol|sou]]s fine and risking imprisonment in the [[Grand Châtelet|Châtelet]] (see below). He designated nine streets in which prostitution would be allowed in Paris, three of them being in the sarcastically named [[Beaubourg]] [[Historical quarters of Paris|quartier]] (Beautiful Neighbourhood)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris75003.fr/rue-beaubourg/|title=Histoire de la Rue Beaubourg|website=paris75003.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rue de la Huchette, Rue Froimon, Rue du Renard-Saint-Merri, Rue Taille pain, Rue Brisemiches, Rue Champ-Fleury, Rue Trace-putain, 
Rue Gratte-cul, and the Rue Tire-Putain) (see below)&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Rossiaud. ''Medieval Prostitution''; trans. Lydia G. Cochrane, New York, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenaweb.voila.net/Saint_Louis.htm|title=St Louis, prostitution et bordels|website=voila.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, this area corresponds to the 1st-4th arrondissements clustered on the [[Rive Droite]] (right bank) of the [[Seine]] (see map). These streets, associated with prostitution, had very evocative if indelicate names including the ''Rue du Poil-au-con'' (or hair of the ''con'', from the [[Latin]] ''[[cunnus]]'' meaning female genitalia, hence Street of the Pubic Hair, or Poil du pubis), later altered to the [[Rue du Pélican]], in the [[1st arrondissement of Paris|1st arrondissement]], near the first [[Porte Saint-Honoré]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbantripparis.blogs-de-voyage.fr/archive/2010/02/02/rue-du-poil-au-con.html Le saviez-vous ?

It is said that ''Tire-Boudin'' was a euphemism invented for [[Mary Queen of Scots]] when she asked after its name, and the street is now named after her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Va9svbIgLwC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;lpg=PA363&amp;dq=tire-vit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tWsW0eKy3z&amp;sig=z2qQfp9L0w04EjAqXMLL_tLF_Es&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fh8BTcCnLo6rnQfhjbXlDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=tire-vit&amp;f=false ''Realms of Memory: The construction of the French past.

In 1358, the Grand Conseil of [[John II of France|John II]] (1350-1364) echoing the "necessary evil" doctrine of [[Saint Augustine|Saints Augustine]] (354-430 AD) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274) declared that "les pécheresses sont absolument nécessaires à la Terre" (Sinners are an absolute necessity for the country).&lt;ref name=prosmoy&gt;[http://medieval.mrugala.net/Femme/Prostitution%20au%20Moyen%20Age/Prostitution%20au%20Moyen%20Age.htm La Prostitution au moyen age]; medieval.mrugala&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution remained confined to designated areas, as indicated in this decree in the reign of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] (1364-1380), by [[Hugh Aubriot]], Provost of Paris in 1367, outlining the areas outside of which prostitutes would be punished 'according to the ordinance of Saint Louis';
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Que toutes les femmes prostituées, tenant bordel en la ville de Paris, allassent demeurer et tenir leurs bordels en places et lieux publics à ce ordonnés et accoutumés, selon l'ordonnance de Saint Louis. C'est à savoir : à L'Abreuvoir de Mascon (à l'angle du pont Saint-Michel et de la rue de la Huchette), en La Boucherie (voisine de la rue de la Huchette), rue Froidmentel, près du clos Brunel (à l'est du Collège de France aboutissant au carrefour du Puits-Certain), en Glatigny (rue nommée Val d'Amour dans la Cité), en la Court-Robert de Pris (rue du Renard-Saint-Merri), en Baille-Hoë (près de l'église Saint-Merri et communiquant avec la rue Taille-Pain et à la rue Brise-Miche), en Tyron (rue entre la rue Saint-Antoine et du roi de Sicile), en la rue Chapon (aboutissant rue du Temple) et en Champ-Flory (rue Champ-Fleury, près du Louvre). Si les femmes publiques, d'écris ensuite cette ordonnance, se permettent d'habiter des rues ou quartiers autres que ceux ci-dessus désignés, elles seront emprisonnées au Châtelet puis bannies de Paris.

Contemporary accounts suggest that this decree was rarely enforced.&lt;ref name=histmais&gt;[http://www.batiweb.com/actualites/histoire_de_maisons_closes_mais_dun_point_de_vue_architectural_3307.html Histoire de maisons.... closes mais d'un point de vue architectural !]; batiweb. Retrieved August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of [[syphilis]] at the end of the 15th century had stigmatized these houses by the end of the 16th century, but their continued existence was confirmed by King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1589-1610).&lt;ref name=faz&gt;Die Schliessung der "Maisons closes" lag im Zug der Zeit, ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', 15 October 1996. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Réglementation (Regulation) ===
[[File:Get lautrec 1894 salon in the rue des moulins.jpg|thumb|[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], ''Salon de la rue des Moulins'', 1894, now housed in the [[Musée Toulouse-Lautrec]] at the {{ill|Palais de la Berbie|fr}}]]
In 1804 [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] ordered the registration and bi-weekly health inspection of all prostitutes. State controlled legal brothels (then known as "''maisons de tolérance''" or "''maisons closes''") started to appear in [[Paris]] and in other cities and became highly popular throughout the century. By 1810, Paris alone had 180 officially approved brothels.

By law, they had to be run by a woman (typically a former prostitute) and their external appearance had to be discreet. Prostitutes working in the ''maisons'', or any woman arrested twice for soliciting had to be registered as such.&lt;ref&gt;Kiedrowski, J.S., &amp; Van Dijk, J.M. (1984). Working papers on Pornography and Prostitution Report 1. Pornography and prostitution in Denmark, France, West Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden, Ottawa: Department of Justice Canada. pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Registration involved having their name on a national register, and agreeing to abide by the regulations and twice weekly medical examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Scibelli, Pasqua (1987). Empowering prostitutes: A proposal for international legal reform. Harvard Women's Law Journal, 10, 117-157&lt;/ref&gt;
This pattern of regulation rapidly spread throughout Europe, partly aided by the Napoleonic occupations.

Among the most expensive and best known [[Parisian brothels|''maisons de tolérance'' in Paris]] were:
* [[le Chabanais]] (opened 1878 and favored by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince Edward]], who had himself made a special "love seat" there),&lt;ref name=times&gt;Dirty Bertie's seat of pleasure, ''[[The Times]]'', 17 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[le Sphinx]],
* la [[La Fleur blanche|Rue des Moulins]],
* le [[One-Two-Two]](opened in the mid-1920s and soon became the top address)
* [[Parisian Brothels#Hotel Marigny|Hotel Marigny]] was the best known brothel for male homosexual clients; it opened in 1917 near [[Palais Garnier|Opera]] in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris|second arrondissement]]&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

More sordid brothels, the ''maisons d'abattage'', offering quick and dirty "services", were popular amongst the lower-class.

The 19th century was also the time of several fabulously rich [[courtesan]]s in Paris, with [[La Païva]] being the most famous one.

==== World War I ====
[[File:MARSEILLE -un coin du vieux marseille -la rue bouterie.jpg|thumb|A group of filles de joie in Marseille, 1919]]
During [[World War I]], in Paris alone, US Army officials estimated that there were 40 major brothels, 5,000 professionally licensed streetwalkers, and another 70,000 unlicensed prostitutes.&lt;ref name=HCNSPlse/&gt; By 1917, there were at least 137 such establishments across 35 towns on or close to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western front]].&lt;ref name=DMail2054914/&gt;

The [[British Army]] adopted local codes of ethics when fighting in another country, and so allowed troops on rest periods and days off to visit what became termed ''maisons tolérées''. Such activity was not just tolerated but encouraged for both the young, as well as the married men who were missing their wives. As the war advanced, so did the need and rank of the prostitutes entertained. While British troops paid just six pence per day were often found in the lowest priced institutes, dominion soldiers from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada received six shillings and could afford higher-class "services". British officers preferred to ''"always indulge with armour (condoms)"'' and took to patronizing German Army officers' former prostitutes when the lines of conflict were advancing towards the end of the war, with the advantage that they sometimes gained tactical and strategic information as well.&lt;ref name=DMail2054914/&gt;

It is unknown how many or what percentage of men visited the institutions, but the French army recorded over a million cases of gonorrhea and syphilis during the war.&lt;ref name=HCNSPlse/&gt; In 1915, in [[Le Havre]], a survey undertaken by the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] counted 171,000 uniformed British Army visitors to the brothels in just one street. As a result, rates of [[venereal disease]] began to climb, with 23,000 British Army men at any time on average during the second half of the campaign hospitalized for treatment,&lt;ref name=HCNSPlse/&gt; with over 150,000 British soldiers having been infected by the end of the war.&lt;ref name=DMail2054914/&gt; The disease at the time had a high social stigma, but a particularly bad infection could get a soldier medically discharged from frontline duty, even on a temporary basis. [[Syphilis]] was treated with injections of mercury, administered at a hospital over a 30-day period, thereby guaranteeing escape from the frontline. The result was that some prostitutes with particularly bad VD infections could charge more. Every British army unit had a sexually transmitted disease clinic, where soldiers could gain an ointment consisting of mercury and chlorine to prevent VD infection, or receive a urethral irrigation with potassium permanganate after STI exposure.&lt;ref name=DMail2054914&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2054914/Sex-Somme-Officially-sanctioned-WWI-brothels-line.html#ixzz1c9OJkNq3|title=Sex and the Somme: The officially sanctioned brothels on the front line laid bare for the first time|author=Clare Makepeace|publisher=Daily Mail|date=29 October 2011|accessdate=29 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Army]] attitude was different, driven by a reformist attitude at home. In October 1917, [[Secretary of War]] [[Newton D. Baker]] said:&lt;ref name=HCNSPlse/&gt;
{{cquote|These boys are going to France. I want them adequately armed and clothed by their government; but I want them to have an invisible armor to take with them . . . a moral and intellectual armor for their protection overseas.}}
Aided by the [[American Social Hygiene Organization]], he closed so called segregated zones close to Army training camps, which included closing the notorious [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] district in [[New Orleans]]. When the two million soldiers of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] had been deployed to France, they were guided by a bulletin from AEF commander Gen. [[John Pershing]] to just say no:&lt;ref name=HCNSPlse/&gt;
{{cquote|Sexual continence is the plain duty of members of the AEF, both for the vigorous conduct of the war, and for the clean health of the American people after the war.}}
This was backed up by additional posters and pamphlets that read "You wouldn't use another fellow's tooth-brush, so why use his whore?" and "A Soldier Who Gets a Dose Is a Traitor!" The US Army had clear instructions on those who did not follow the no indulgence rule. US Army regulations required soldiers who admitted to having sex while on leave to submit to chemical prophylaxis, that included irrigating the penis. Soldiers who did not report for prophylaxis and later contracted VD were subject to [[court-martial]] and possibly a hard-labor sentence, while those who contracted disease after treatment only lost pay during treatment. Implemented from the first day of training, the initiative was so successful that US Army doctors reported that 96% of the cases they treated had been contracted while the soldier was still a civilian.&lt;ref name=HCNSPlse/&gt;

However, on debarkation at the designated port of [[St. Nazaire]], a dispute with French authorities broke out, after the AEF placed the ''Maisons Tolérée'' off limits. With the dispute escalating, President [[Georges Clemenceau]] sent a memo to Gen. Pershing offering a compromise: American medical authorities would control designated brothels operated solely for American soldiers. Pershing passed the proposal to [[Raymond Fosdick]], who on giving it to Secretary Baker responded: "For God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the president or he'll stop the war." The French later proposed a deal that targeted the [[Black American]] troops, most of whom were assigned to unloading freight in segregated stevedore battalions, again flatly turned down by US authorities. But this merely highlighted US differential racial policy, as all black troops were required by US Army regulations to undertake prophylaxis when returning from leave, whether or not they acknowledged sexual contact.&lt;ref name=HCNSPlse/&gt;

The policy adopted by the US Army worked, with far lower rates of VD across their troops compared to French or British and Dominion combatants. However, after the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], when the US Army could no longer plead military necessity as grounds for curtailing leave, VD rates among US Army troops shot up.&lt;ref name=HCNSPlse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorychannelclub.com/articles/articletype/articleview/articleid/72/no-sex-please-were-american|title=No Sex, Please, We're American|author=Fred D.

==== World War II ====
During [[World War II]], [[Edith Summerskill, Baroness Summerskill|Dr Edith Sumerskill]] raised the issue of ''Maisons Tolérées'' in Parliament to [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Anthony Eden]] after the intervention of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1940/jun/04/maisons-tolerees|title=MAISONS TOLéRéES|publisher=[[Hansard]]|date=4 June 1940|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further questions were raised in Parliament after the [[D-Day]] invasion, to ensure such local practises and medical precautions were continued.

During the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]], twenty top Paris ''maisons'', including [[le Chabanais]], le Sphinx and le [[One-Two-Two]], were reserved by the [[Wehrmacht]] for German officers and collaborating Frenchmen.&lt;ref name=faz/&gt;
The brothels flourished during this time, and [[Hermann Göring]] visited ''Le Chabanais'', as is related in the 2009 two-volume book ''1940-1945 Années Erotiques'' by [[Patrick Buisson]].&lt;ref name=daily&gt;Peter Allen, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1175836/Sleeping-enemy-How-horizontal-collaborators-Paris-brothels-enjoyed-golden-age-entertaining-Hitlers-troops.html Sleeping with the enemy: How 'horizontal collaborators' in Paris brothels enjoyed a golden age entertaining Hitler's troops], ''Daily Mail'', 1 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abolitionism in France ===

==== Loi de Marthe Richard (1946) ====
{{main|Loi Marthe Richard}}
After the war, [[Marthe Richard]], a town councillor in Paris and former street prostitute, successfully campaigned for the closure of all "maisons". On 13 April 1946, the "loi de Marthe Richard" was passed with votes of the Christian-Democratic Party ([[Popular Republican Movement|MRP]]) and the Communist Party ([[French Communist Party|PCF]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite French law|article=|number or usual name=n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 46-685|date in French=13 avril 1946|full name=dite « Marthe Richard » tendant à la fermeture des maisons de tolérance et au renforcement de la lutte contre le proxénétisme|language=French|URL=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000693391&amp;categorieLien=id}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter considered brothels to be "[[bourgeois]]". As a result, the legal brothels were closed. (This serves as a plot point in the first James Bond novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''.) However, prostitution remained a legal activity, with only its organization and "exploitation" ([[pimping]]) forbidden.

This ended a system in existence since 1804, which effectively made prostitutes less visible without suppressing the trade, and thus preservied "public morality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointsdactu.org/article.php3?id_article=279 |title=A l'occasion des 60 ans de la loi Marthe Richard : un peu d'histoire. - Société - Points d'actu |author=Bibliothèque municipale de Lyon |website=pointsdactu.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727184142/http://www.pointsdactu.org/article.php3?id_article=279 |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitute registries were supposed to be destroyed, but police kept files till 1960. Roughly 20,000 women were affected by this law, and approximately 1,400 houses were closed. Many former brothel owners soon opened "hôtels de passe" instead, where prostitutes could keep on working, but the visibility of their activities was reduced.

Critics of French prostitution policy, such as [[Mouvement du Nid]], question how effective this was, its implementation, and whether it really closed the "maisons". For instance, they point to the presence of military brothels in Algeria till 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mouvementdunid.org/La-loi-du-13-avril-1946-dite|title=Mouvement du Nid|website=mouvementdunid.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727094915/http://www.mouvementdunid.org/La-loi-du-13-avril-1946-dite|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the ''Office central pour la répression de la traite des êtres humains'' (OCRTEH) was created as a branch of the police, to combat pimping and cooperate with Interpol. It is under the direction of the Minister of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/r00-209/r00-2098.html|title=Les politiques publiques et la prostitution. Rapport d'information sur l'activité de la délégation aux droits des femmes et à l'égalité des chances entre les hommes et les femmes pour l'année 2000|website=senat.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mazur/&gt;

==== 1960: Ratification of 1949 UN Convention ====
France became officially "[[Abolition of Prostitution|abolitionist]]" in 1960 when it ratified the 1949 UN [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|Convention on the Suppression of Trafficking and the Exploitation of Prostitution]].&lt;ref name=allwood08/&gt;

==== State policy from 1960 ====
In the debates over prostitution in France, "abolition" was used to refer to both the abolition of laws and regulations that make any distinction between someone involved in prostitution and the general population, and the abolition of prostitution itself. At that time, police files on prostitutes were finally destroyed.&lt;ref name=allwood08/&gt;
However, implementation varied considerably locally, although prostitution was rarely on the political agenda over the next 30 years. Exceptions were the demonstrations of prostitutes rights movements against police harassment in 1975, and periodic calls by individual politicians for re-opening the "maisons" (see ''Maisons closes'' below).
These included that of {{ill|Michèle Barzach|fr}} ([[Rally for the Republic|RPR]]), a former [[Minister of Health (France)|Minister of health]] (1986-1988) in 1990, as a public health measure, given the concerns about HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=mazur&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbAUdBR2f5sC&amp;pg=PA123|title=The Politics of Prostitution|website=google.ca|isbn=9780521540698|last1=Outshoorn|first1=Joyce|date=2004-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State policy has been built on two principles - criminalization, and support. Criminalization of the exploitation (brothels, procuring, pimping) of prostitution, and support and re-integration for those exiting. However, the latter attracted few funds, and was largely left to charitable NGOs. Only a single position within the Department of Social Services had responsibility for this part of policy and funding.&lt;ref name=mazur/&gt;
The original intention was that the [[Departments of France|Departments]] would set up their own Prevention and Rehabilitation Services, but of 100, only 12 were created following the 1960 ordinance, and by 1999, there were only 5, run by NGOs.&lt;ref name=derycke/&gt;
Other state responsibilities have fallen to the women's rights administration,&lt;ref name=mazur/&gt;
and also to health, finance, interior, foreign, and education ministries from time to time.

==== Penal Code 1994 ====
In the new Penal Code, pimping became a serious offence if associated with organized crime or barbarity, and overall was defined at three levels of severity with increasing fines, and prison sentences from five years up to life imprisonment. Clients were only criminalized if purchasing from minors under 15 years of age.

In 1998, sex tourism was added if offences against minors were committed by French residents outside France.&lt;ref name=derycke/&gt;

==== International policy ====
In the 1990s, France became increasingly assertive internationally as a champion of abolitionism, opposing moves towards liberalization and regulation by the Netherlands and the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/global/About_the_ILO/Media_and_public_information/Press_releases/lang--en/WCMS_007994/index.htm The Sex Sector: The economic and social bases of prostitution in Southeast Asia edited by Lin Lean Lim, International Labour Office, Geneva, 1998.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209045658/http://www.ilo.org/global/About_the_ILO/Media_and_public_information/Press_releases/lang--en/WCMS_007994/index.htm |date=2010-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
France also opposed the distinction between 'free' and 'forced' prostitution in international discussions. [[Hubert Védrine]] the [[List of Foreign Ministers of France|foreign minister]] asserted France's position at various international venues, such as the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography|protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale and prostitution of children and child pornography]] (2000) and the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|Convention on organized crime with the protocol on trafficking]] ([[Palermo]] 2000). French policy emphasised, along with the International Convention, that the real evil was prostitution, not trafficking, defined as an "accompanying evil". At the same time, [[Nicole Péry]], minister for women's rights (''Secrétaire d'État aux droits des femmes''; 1998-2002), included prostitution in her department's campaign on violence against women, calling it a form of violence at [[Beijing Women's Conference|Beijing+5]], ([[New York City|New York]] 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Péry N.

==== Loi Sarkozy (Loi pour la sécurité intérieure) 2003 ====
Active solicitation was also outlawed in the late 1940s. Passive solicitation (being present with revealing clothes at locations known for prostitution) was outlawed in 2003 as part of a package of law-and-order measures by then-interior minister, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], in his "Domestic Security Bill" (loi pour la sécurité intérieure 2003, or LSI also known as Loi Sarkozy II), and had the effect of reducing the visibility of prostitution on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Loi pour la sécurité intérieure de 2003|Loi pour la sécurité intérieure de 2003 Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Prostitutes' organizations decried the measure, which came into force in March 2003, calling it punitive and fated to increase the power of pimps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article7208.ece French police turn attention to 'the pimp on the corner'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121181243/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article7208.ece |date=2007-11-21 }}, ''[[The Independent]]'', 21 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Many prostitutes started to work out of vans, a strategy authorities attempted to combat by using parking regulation enforcement.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite news|title=How prostitution became France's hottest social issue|author=|date=24 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/24/prostitution-france-hottest-social-issue?newsfeed=true|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Law 444 (2016) ====
Law number 2016-444 "visant à renforcer la lutte contre le système prostitutionnel et à accompagner les personnes prostituées" (''Eng.: "to strengthen the fight against the prostitution system and to support prostituted persons"'') was enacted on 6 April 2016, with effect from 13 April 2016.&lt;ref name="law444"&gt;{{cite web|title=LOI n° 2016-444 du 13 avril 2016 visant à renforcer la lutte contre le système prostitutionnel et à accompagner les personnes prostituées|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000032396046&amp;categorieLien=id|website=Legifrance|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most publicised provision of this law is that the buying of sexual acts was made illegal and punishable with a fine of up to €3,750.&lt;ref name="law444" /&gt; However, the bulk of this law is concerned with supporting prostitutes exiting the industry and supporting victims of [[sex trafficking]].&lt;ref name="law444" /&gt;

In the first six months after the law was enacted, 249 men were prosecuted for purchasing sexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loi sur la prostitution: 249 amendes dressées en six mois|url=http://www.linfo.re/france/societe/703032-loi-sur-la-prostitution-249-amendes-dressees-en-six-mois|website=Linfo|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=French|date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
It is legal for a man or woman to be a prostitute and sell sexual acts.&lt;ref name="SOS Femmes 1"&gt;"[http://www.sosfemmes.com/sexwork/sexwork_droit.htm SOS Femmes Accueil - Prostitution - Le cadre juridique en France]" {{fr icon}} [http://www.sosfemmes.com/english_sexwork/english_sexwork_legal_aspect.htm English Version]&lt;/ref&gt; The buying of sexual acts was outlawed in April 2016.&lt;ref name="law16" /&gt;
''Racolage'' (soliciting), including ''racolage passif'' (passive soliciting) is prohibited. This is defined as standing in a public place known for prostitution, dressed in revealing attire, and is punishable by up to six months in prison and a fine of €3750.&lt;ref name="racolage"&gt;Article L. 225-10-1 of the Code pénal defines passive soliciting (racolage passif) as "the act, by any means, even a passive attitude, to solicit another in the aim of inciting him or her to have sexual relations in exchange for remuneration or a promise of remuneration..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,819529,00.html French war on immorality targets porn, prostitutes and pay-TV], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
Owning or operating a brothel is illegal.&lt;ref name="SOS Femmes 1" /&gt;

All forms of ''proxénétisme'' ([[pimp|procuring]]) are illegal.&lt;ref name="procuring"&gt;"[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006417850&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=cid Article 225-5 of the Code Pénal (partie législative)]" on Legifrance. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Proxénétisme'' is defined as:
* "helping" someone to prostitute themselves
* profiting from the prostitution of another person, or receiving funds from someone who prostitutes themselves habitually (living off the avails)
* hiring or training someone to prostitute themselves, or pressuring someone to prostitute themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mouvementdunid.org/La-loi-francaise La loi francaise. Mouvement du Nid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124005345/http://www.mouvementdunid.org/La-loi-francaise |date=2010-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
France is an "abolitionist" country - its public policy is the prohibition and eradication of prostitution; however, at the same time, it considers that making it illegal to offer sexual acts in return for goods or services in the context of one's private life is a violation of individual liberty.&lt;ref name="SOS Femmes 1" /&gt;

The issue has been prominent on the French political agenda since the late 1990s, responding to international pressures on [[child prostitution]] and [[child pornography|pornography]] and [[human trafficking|trafficking]], international distinctions between forced and voluntary entry into prostitution (rejected by the dominant "abolitionist" discourse) and increasing migration. This has been accompanied by increasing discourse on ''la sécurité'' internally, which has gradually become dominant, affecting the framework in which prostitution is debated. This was heightened in 2002 when [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s right-wing government (2002-2005) succeeded the ''Gauche Plurielle'' ([[plural left]]) coalition of [[Lionel Jospin]] (1997-2002). The Jospin construction was that prostitutes were victims and needed to be saved and re-integrated. This was a view shared by [[state feminists]], ministers, delegates, and the powerful abolitionist lobby, and is reflected in the Derycke report as well as the National Commission on Violence Against Women,&lt;ref name=hazan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/024000228/index.shtml|title=Le système de la prostitution. Une violence à l'encontre des femmes - Rapports publics - La Documentation française|author=La Documentation française|website=ladocumentationfrancaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
as well as the debates on modern slavery (''esclavage moderne'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/rap-info/i3459.asp|title=N° 3459 - Rapport d'information de M.

These consultations in turn enabled agents of the civil society access to the policy process. Very few of these constructed prostitution as a legitimate form of work.

At the municipal level, there was evidence of prostitutes being constructed as public nuisances that needed to be confined, and many mayors of both political groups responded to citizen groups to introduce by-laws restricting prostitutes' activities in early 2002. This was fuelled by an apparent increased visibility. For instance, [[Françoise de Panafieu]] (UMP delegate [[17th arrondissement of Paris|17th arondissement]]) campaigned against street prostitution in the summer of 2002. The commitment to abolitionism prevented specific laws aimed at prostitution (which would have been seen as regulation) initially, so they often used traffic and parking by-laws to drive out workers, which ultimately mean that they were moved from well-lit busy areas to much more unsafe areas. As the discourse shifted from abolitionism to security, so did more explicit laws and regulations. This disquiet enabled Nicolas Sarkozy to later mobilize public anxiety about security evident in the [[French presidential election, 2002|elections that year]] in his Domestic Security bill.&lt;ref name=allwood08/&gt;

The cultural context is the concept of gender equality as stated in the preamble to the [[French Constitution of 1946|1946]] and 1958 constitution and which had seen an increasing momentum of political gains for women, including the establishment of a women's policy agency in 1974 and a ministry of women's rights in 1981. However, a significant gap still exists in terms of economic and employment opportunities. Meanwhile, immigration policies have become increasingly restrictive, and soliciting can result in the removal of a migrant's work permit.&lt;ref name="allwood06"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxQKtfQJFr0C&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=International Approaches to Prostitution|website=google.ca|isbn=9781861346728|last1=Gangoli|first1=Geetanjali|last2=Westmarland|first2=Nicole|date=2006-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] Manifesto calls for holding clients "responsible". The vague language is due to the fact that such measures remain controversial in the Socialist Party.&lt;ref name="Libé 1"&gt;"[http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/191649.FR.php Prostitution : le PS veut pénaliser les clients]" Coignard, Jacqueline. ''[[Libération]]''. 6 July 2006. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Manifesto also calls for repealing the ban on "passive solicitation".&lt;ref name="Libé 1" /&gt;

In 2010, [[Chantal Brunel]], an [[National Assembly of France|MP]] in Sarkozy's ruling right-wing [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party, and newly appointed head of the equality office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.fr/elle/Societe/La-parole-aux-femmes/A-vous-de-le-dire/Chantal-Brunel-nommee-a-la-tete-de-l-Observatoire-de-la-parite/%28gid%29/1181415|title=A vous de le dire, Societe, Chantal Brunel nommée à la tête de l'Observatoire de la parité - Elle|author=Anonyme|website=elle.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
called for legalizing and regulating ''maisons closes'' (brothels), (see Maisons closes, below) akin to the situation in several surrounding countries, claiming that this would make the sex trade safer and transparent.&lt;ref name=guardian2/&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7067876.ece|title=Login|website=timesonline.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; She outlined the strategy in her 2010 book "Pour en finir avec les violences faites aux femmes" (''An end to violence against women'').

Instead, they demand the repeal of the 2003 law outlawing solication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French sex workers protest legal brothels|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/french-sex-workers-protest-legal-brothels-20100325-qyn1.html|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=10 April 2018|language=en|date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20004799-503543.html|title=Prostitutes Give French Brothel Proposal Red Light|date=12 May 2010|website=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the socialist women's minister [[Najat Vallaud-Belkacem]] announced that she wanted to abolish prostitution in France and in Europe.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

=== State feminism ===
[[State feminism|State feminists]] dominated the discourse in the left-wing Jospin years, pursuing an anti-male-violence campaign. As Women's Minister, Nicole Péry, confirmed in her New York speech (see above), prostitution, as a form of male violence, was very much part of that State strategy.

This influence has waned under the security agenda of the succeeding right-wing governments, but is still evident in the new political thinking, as stated in [[Marie-Jo Zimmermann]]'s ([[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]) 2002 report to the Delegation on Women's Rights on prostitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/rap-info/i0459.asp|title=N° 0459 - Rapport d'information sur la sécurité intérieure (Mme Marie-Jo Zimmermann) sur le projet de loi, adopté par le Sénat (n° 381) (volet prostitution)|author=|date=5 December 2002|website=Assemblée Nationale|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in which she echoes the left wing sentiment that the purchase of sex constitutes violence. The pervasiveness of this thinking is even found in the budget.&lt;ref&gt;Projet de loi des finances pour 2004 État des crédits qui concourent aux actions en faveur des droits des femmes&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political and social debates ==
As in many other countries, debates on the nature and regulation of transactional sex are highly polarized. These positions are the familiar ones that define sex work as violence against women on the one hand, and those who see the problem as stigmatisation and poor working conditions on the other. These result in proposals for either the eradication of prostitution, or social reforms. The dominant abolitionist faction consists of Catholics, family values advocates and sections within feminism and the left. As elsewhere, the term ''abolitionism'' has seen a shift from the abolition of [[Prostitution in France#Réglementation (Regulation)|Réglementation]] to include abolition of [[sexual slavery]].

From the abolition of ''Réglementation'' and the ''[[maisons closes]]'' (1946) to the late 1990s, there was a broad abolitionist consensus. This resulted from a close fit between the government position and the dominant socio-political discourse, making it acceptable to a broad coalition that included abolitionists, secular and religious NGOs, politicians from both ends of the political spectrum, and most French feminists. This was so dominant under the Jospin years as to appear normative and non-ideological&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lecavalierbleu.com/f/index.php?sp=liv&amp;livre_id=19|title=La Prostitution|website=lecavalierbleu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and above any philosophical debate.&lt;ref name=derycke/&gt;
This provides abolitionists access to both the policy process and to resources, such as the 2000 UNESCO conference (see below), which had high-profile support, including important left-wing figures such as [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]] and [[Sylviane Agacinski]], who was also married to Lionel Jospin.&lt;ref name=allwood08/&gt;

In the 1990s, a number of changes shifted the focus of debates. These included an increasing globalization of movements on both parts of the debate, [[Prostitution in Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] were moving to change their legislation in two distinct and different directions, there was political instability in Eastern Europe and there was also increasing concern about [[AIDS]], while state feminists were also playing an increasing part in policy debates. There were however occasional dissenting voices such as the debate in Le Nouvel Observateur in 1999, sparked by the Dutch legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/opinion/00000819.EDI0001/pour-ou-contre-la-legalisation-des-maisons-closes.html|title=Pour ou contre la légalisation des maisons closes|date=29 December 1999|website=L'Obs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 2000 manifestations ===
A manifestation of abolitionism was the declaration of May 18, 2000, published in the centre-left ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', called "''Le corps n'est pas une marchandise''" ("The body is not a commodity"). This was signed by 35 prominent citizens, and demanded that France and Europe affirm their commitment to the abolition of prostitution, resulting in a debate covering many aspects of the subject, such as choice, autonomy, voice, and agency.

That same week, the [[Minister of Social Affairs (France)|Minister of Labour]], [[Martine Aubry]], proclaimed in the Assemblée nationale that France would continue to defend its abolitionist position against prostitution, because the commodification of human bodies was not acceptable and a violation of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/societe/20000517.OBS4495/la-france-est-abolitionniste-rappelle-martine-aubry.html|title=La France est abolitionniste, rappelle Martine Aubry|date=17 May 2000|website=L'Obs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prostitution - Mme Aubry réaffirme la position abolitionniste de la France.

[[UNESCO]] held a conference in Paris on May 16 of that year (''Peuple de l'Abîme.

organized by {{ill|Fondation Jean-et-Jeanne-Scelles|fr}} (Fondation Scelles),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondationscelles.org/index.php|title=exploitation sexuelle : prostitution, proxénétisme, tourisme sexuel|website=fondationscelles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
an abolitionist NGO, which also published ''Le livre noir de la prostitution'', a strongly worded attack on the subject of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondationscelles.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=108:publications&amp;catid=51:publications&amp;Itemid=52&amp;lang=en|title=www.fondationscelles.org|first=Super|last=User|website=www.fondationscelles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, 189 cases of pimping were tried, and 137 sentenced to prison. Generally the judiciary were satisfied with the existing legislation,&lt;ref name=derycke/&gt;
although 2000 also saw the creation of a new unit of the Judicial Police using information technology to combat pimping and trafficking. Transnational operators proved a problem to the police.&lt;ref name=allwood06/&gt;

=== The Senate inquiry (1999-2001) ===
State feminism culminated in the [[French Senate|Senate]]'s new ''Délégation Aux Droits Des Femmes'' (Delegation for Women's Rights)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/commissions/delf-index.asp|title=Délégation aux droits des femmes et à l'égalité des chances entre les hommes et les femmes|author=Assemblée Nationale|date=|website=assemblee-nationale.fr|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
initiating an inquiry in 1999. The 2001 report of the Delegation (named after its author, Senator [[Dinah Derycke]] (1997-2001))&lt;ref name=derycke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/r00-209/r00-209.html|title=Les politiques publiques et la prostitution.

was critical of what it saw as the lack of commitment in the fight against prostitution, mainly the difference between France's official abolitionist position and what was occurring in practice. Although the report received a favourable reception in parliament initially, its political impact was limited. Senator Derycke retired due to ill health and died soon after, while other pressures diverted the debate into other related measures, such as organized crime and trafficking and 'modern slavery'. Outside parliament, there was a new activism and demand for action, led by ''[[Les amis du bus des femmes|Bus des femmes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lesamisdubusdesfemmes.com/default.aspx Les amis du Bus des femmes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110214658/http://lesamisdubusdesfemmes.com/default.aspx |date=January 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
But the focus of the outcry was trafficking, with an emphasis on Eastern Europe. However, the new right-wing government elected in 2002 ([[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]) was to completely change the way prostitution was perceived (see below).&lt;ref name="allwood06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=boucher151002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cr-delf/02-03/c0203002.asp|title=Délégation Aux Droits Des Femmes Et À L'égalité Des Chances Entre Les Hommes Et Les Femmes, Compte Rendu N° 2|author=|date=15 October 2002|website=Assemblée Nationale|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Criticism of the dominant discourse came from prostitute' rights advocates, health associations, such as Cabiria (Lyons),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cabiria.pagesperso-orange.fr/cabiria.html|title=Action de santé communautaire avec les personnes prostituées|website=pagesperso-orange.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[AIDS]] groups, and some activists who complained that sex workers were being treated paternalistically and denied voice and moral agency. They demanded eradication of stigma and restoration of rights, access to health and social services, and better "working conditions". Organizations such as Cabiria, [[:fr:Act Up-Paris|ACT-UP Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actupparis.org/|title=Act Up-Paris est une association de lutte contre le sida. Rejoignez-nous !|website=actupparis.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[:fr:Groupe de prévention et d'action pour la santé et le travail des transsexuel(le)s|PASTT]], and [[AIDES]]-Paris Isle-de-France condemned the UNESCO conference (above) as stigmatizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editions-belin.com/ewb_pages/f/fiche-article-mobilisations-de-prostituees-4263.php|title=Editions Belin - Mobilisations de prostituées|website=editions-belin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All parties claimed they spoke on behalf of and for sex workers, and shared a concern for their welfare, while denying their opponents did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sisyphe.org/spip.php?article153|title=Sisyphe - Pour une critique de la politique pro-prostitution de Cabiria|author=SisypheÉlaine Audet|website=sisyphe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, both sides held a position that workers should not be penalized, positioned as either victims or legitimate workers.

=== Security debates 2002 ===
New issues arising in 2002 were local residents' complaints and the ascendacy of a law and order discourse on both left and right, leading to a heated debate,&lt;ref&gt;Claude Boucher ''Défendre les travailleuses du sexe''; [[Elizabeth Badinter]] ''Si c'est leur choix''; [[Wassila Tamzali]] ''Le devoir d'interdire''; [[Françoise de Panafieu]] ''Pourquoire j'ai tapé le poing sur la table''. Le Nouvel Observateur August 22, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; notably the suggestion by [[Françoise de Panafieu]] ([[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]) that the [[:fr:maisons closes|maisons closes]] (see Maisons closes below) be re-opened.&lt;ref name=jdm0702&gt;
''Pourquoi la prostitution ne s'exercerait-elle pas dans des lieux précis, maisons closes ou autres structures ?'' [[Le Journal du Dimanche]] July 2002. Later, she added ''"Je dirais que la bonne vieille maison close ne peut en aucun cas servir et ne correspond pas au droit européen"''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encorefem0702&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encorefeministes.free.fr/actions/action8prost.php3|title=Encore féministes ! Action n° 8|website=free.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The issue of "security" became a major issue in the [[French presidential election, 2002|presidential]] and [[French legislative election, 2002|parliamentary]] elections of 2002. The catch-cry of "to save the Republic" worked in the favour of the right and President [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] who came to power as Prime Minister that year.
[[Nicolas Sarkozy]] became [[Minister of the Interior (France)|minister of the interior]] in the incoming right-wing [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin|Rafferin]] government (2002-2005), almost immediately announcing a ''Domestic Security Bill'' ([[:fr:Loi sur la sécurité intérieure|Loi No 2003-239 pour la sécurité intérieure]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=d013503&amp;idtable=d013503%7cd012823%7cd17028-12188_13&amp;_c=compte+rendu&amp;rch=ds&amp;de=20021114&amp;au=20021114&amp;dp=1+an&amp;radio=deau&amp;aff=7028&amp;tri=p&amp;off=0&amp;afd=ppr&amp;afd=ppl&amp;afd=pjl&amp;afd=cvn|title=Loi No 2003-239 pour la sécurité intérieure|website=senat.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the focus of the debates around prostitution shifted to legislation. (see Public opinion 2002, below)&lt;ref name=allwood08/&gt;

==== Legislation (Domestic Security Law) 2003 ====
In justifying these measures, Sarkozy claimed large segments of the population were exposed to "anxiety and legitimate exasperation". Article 42 addressed the protection of women in prostitution, considered victims of exploitation, and these were amplified by the Minister for Equality in the Workplace, [[Nicole Ameline]] (2002-2004).&lt;ref&gt;Ministre déléguée auprès du ministre des affaires sociales, du travail et de la solidarité à la parité et à l'égalité professionnelle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/basile/rechercheGlobale.do;jsessionid=5F107822C48AF3C151462E0B821AC512?idRecherche=48f675%3A12c7862f720%3A-166d&amp;unk=compte+rendu&amp;dp=1+an&amp;radio=deau&amp;de=14%2F11%2F2002&amp;au=14%2F11%2F2002&amp;action=OK&amp;rch=gs|title=Site du sénat|website=senat.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sarkozy stated that by criminalizing passive soliciting, he was protecting prostitutes and helping them escape organized crime.&lt;ref name=monde23oct02&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=777778 M. Sarkozy défend son projet de loi sur la sécurité intérieure ''Le Monde'' 23 Oct 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Government position was that action against certain activities would improve the quality of life and sense of security of the poor, who are likely to be victims of crime. Sarkozy stated that the poor supported a tough crime agenda and that the general population wanted a stronger stand on law and order. In particular, he cited an [[Ipsos]] poll suggesting that 80% of people on minimum wage approved of his proposals and that the lower the [[socio-economic class]] the more support.&lt;ref name=monde23oct02/&gt;
In February 2002, a poll suggested security was the most important issue on people's minds in an election year, and in October, 70% of the population considered the proposed measures necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vie-publique.fr/politiques-publiques/securite-interieure/sentiment-insecurite/|title=Les Français et l'insécurité,. La sécurité intérieure (1995-2005). Politiques publiques - repères - vie-publique.fr|website=vie-publique.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sarkozy bill both redefined prostitution and transformed policy, making solicitation, previously a minor offence, a serious offence (un délit) (up to six months imprisonment initially, but amended to two), with stiffer fines, and brought back "passive" solicitation as a crime (Article 50). Passive solicitation had been previously decriminalized by another right-wing government, that of [[Édouard Balladur|Balladur]] in 1994.

Proposed Article 225-10-1 removed the necessity of the police having evidence of soliciting, allowing 'dress or posture' to be sufficient. He explained that it was inconvenient for the police to have to obtain evidence of active soliciting. In the Senate, a Government amendment subsequently deleted reference to dress after a popular outcry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=d012823&amp;idtable=d013503|d012823|d17028-12188_13&amp;_c=compte+rendu&amp;rch=ds&amp;de=20021114&amp;au=20021114&amp;dp=1+an&amp;radio=deau&amp;aff=7028&amp;tri=p&amp;off=0&amp;afd=ppr&amp;afd=ppl&amp;afd=pjl&amp;afd=cvn Projet de Loi as presented to the Senate on October 23 2002 by M. Sarkozy. "''par sa tenue vestimentaire ou son attitude''" was amended to "''par une attitude même passive''"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Article 50 also criminalized purchase of sex from those considered 'particularly vulnerable', such as 'illness, disability, physical or mental deficiency or pregnancy'.

Furthermore, the new legislation allowed for foreigners to have their permits revoked for disturbing public order, allowing deportation to become a penalty for solicitation (active or passive), even if they were legal immigrants. It addressed trafficking, by defining it and attached penalties. In the case of alleged victims of trafficking, collaboration allowed them to stay and work till their case was heard. If an exploiters were convicted (Article 76), they could then receive permanent residence. Finally, article 52 allowed for annual reports to be published on prostitution in France, from 2004 onwards.

==== Reactions ====
Reactions included demonstrations and petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1434665|title=Hard on ladies of the night: The French government is cracking down on prostitution|author=|date=7 November 2002|website=The Economist|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Criticism came from the left, trade unions, women's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectifdroitsdesfemmes.org/spip.php?article87|title=Le projet de loi Sarkozy et la prostitution|website=collectifdroitsdesfemmes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and human rights and poverty groups who saw this bill, which simultaneously addressed begging, squatting and assembling in public areas of buildings,&lt;ref name=sarkozyexpose&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/leg/pjl02-030.html|title=Projet de loi pour la sécurité intérieure|website=senat.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as an attack on the poor, stating that no one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, M., B. Marcus et al. [http://www.ldh-france.org/ Ligue des droits de l'Homme], Syndicat des Avocats de France, Syndicat de la Magistrature. "Lettre ouverte à Monsieur Sarkozy" Le Nouvel Observateur (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanite.fr/node/431676|title=Marie-George Buffet s'invite|website=L'Humanité}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sarkozy was accused of exploiting people's insecurities. In the Senate, the measures were seen to be street cleaning, rather than addressing the causes of social problems and [[social exclusion]], and that reconstructing prostitution as a law and order issue would merely drive it underground, depriving sex workers from access to services, and damaging AIDS campaigns. it was stated that no-one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute, to live in neighbourhoods with no facilities and no public services". It was noted that there was no action to deal with organized crime or those who might be exploiting sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/seances/s200211/s20021114/s20021114_mono.html Senat SEANCE DU 14 NOVEMBRE 2002] Comments of Mme Hélène Luc and M. Jacques Mahéas&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of passive solicitation caused particular concern since it could mean that any woman could be arrested for the way she dressed, and it was particularly hard to define. The judiciary were equally unhappy with evidence that solely consisted of police testimony and were reluctant to convict.&lt;ref&gt;Colas H. à Bordeaux, la justice distanciée par la police. L'Humanité Dec 20 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
It was suggested that concern for victims for trafficking was hardly consistent with punishing them, and that prostitution had become conflated with trafficking. The trafficking policy seemed more aimed at the porousness of borders than at actual criminals, while migrant sex workers appeared to be particularly discriminated against, since they were simultaneously 'rescued' and deported without in any way addressing their vulnerability. Calls for aiming trafficking policy at traffickers rather than sex workers came from the Senate Law Commission, the Delegations for Women's Rights in the Senate and National Assembly, as well as from the opposition.

In the Senate hearings into prostitution that year, Claude Boucher of ''[[Les amis du bus des femmes|Bus des Femmes]]'', a sex worker support group, described how sex workers sell sex to survive, unable to make ends meet on social security or the minimum wage. To treat them as criminals, she argued, would just make them more vulnerable. "''Cette loi n'est même pas une loi d'ordre moral, c'est une loi contre les exclus, contre les plus vulnérables''" (This law is not even a public morals law, it is a law against those who are excluded, against the most vulnerable)

==== Evaluation ====
Sarkozy did not attempt to produce a comprehensive policy on prostitution, but rather a quick fix, addressing immediate concerns of voters in terms of visibility.&lt;ref name=sarkozyexpose/&gt;
In this, he succeeded, at least in the short term. The police reported a 40% decrease in prevalence, but also that it had moved to more discreet areas and hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lmdldb.wordpress.com/2004/01/14/1913/|title=Le Mur de Laine de Briques}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the more profound effect was that Sarkozy had changed the framing of sex workers from victims to criminals, and tied it to immigration debates, focusing narrowly on street transactions. This avoided inconveniencing the middle-class clients, who might have created more opposition. The governmental policy tended to portray all immigrant women in prostitution, the most vulnerable, as victims of trafficking and exploitation, and their pimps as "foreigners".

Following the law coming into effect, 5,619 charges of passive solicitation were laid between March 2003 and July 2004, 90% of these were women, and most from [[Bulgaria]] and [[Albania]] (40%), [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Cameroon]] (35%). 15% were French nationals, another 10% from other areas in Africa and 2% from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://0869935g.esi6.crdp-poitiers.cndp.fr/search.php?action=Record&amp;id=MF_MF04112610440413_2004 Des associations constatent un timide reflux de la prostitution.

There was a notable increase in foreign workers detained and deported. In 2004, the police dismantled many trafficking networks, mainly involving Eastern Europe and Africa.
&lt;ref&gt;Agence France Presse 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
While the law referred to protection, shelter, and re-integration, there was no provision made for this, according to [[Cimade]], an NGO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimade.org/ [[Cimade]]] Les prostituées en détention. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
The results of the law were considered disastrous for the women who were supposed to be protected. The effects were largely those of displacement, pushing their activities into isolated areas, and the 3-7am timeslot, isolated them from service agencies, exposed them to violence and destroyed the historical working relationship with the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/2003/10/14prostitution|title=Women beyond the pale|website=mondediplo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chartier C. le coup de la loi Chartier C. le coup de la loi. L'Express March 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
A study by [[Anne Hidalgo]] and [[Christophe Caresche]], Deputy mayors in the office of the Mayor of Paris ([[Bertrand Delanoë]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bertranddelanoe/2072898523/|title=Christophe Caresche, Pierre Schapira, Anne Hidalgo|website=Flickr - Photo Sharing!}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was especially critical:

&lt;blockquote&gt;«''En amalgamant prostitution libre et prostitution forcée, qui relèvent de processus totalement différents, en victimisant les personnes qui se prostituent, sans distinction, cette loi légitime et renforce les violences symboliques, physiques, policières, institutionnelles. Elle renforce aussi leur insécurité, les obligeant à investir des lieux éloignés des regards, d'autant plus qu'elle les contraint à travailler davantage puisque toutes ont vu leur clientèle se raréfier, et par conséquent leur revenu diminuer de 50 % en moyenne''»&lt;ref&gt;By combining free prostitution and forced prostitution, which are totally different entities, by victimizing prostitutes without distinction, the law legitimizes and reinforces the symbolic violence, physical, police, and institutional. It also strengthens their insecurity, forcing them to work in areas far from public view, and especially it forces them to work harder since all have noticed that their customers are more scarce, and therefore their earnings have fallen 50% on average.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ref name=allwood06/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france-mail-forum.de/fmf30/pol/30grosje.htm Blandine Grosjean. Des filles de joie bien à la peine. Libération 13 June 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023152155/http://www.france-mail-forum.de/fmf30/pol/30grosje.htm |date=23 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy had made a sharp distinction between the "classic prostitution" of the traditional French Fille de Joie, who he depicted as unproblematic, even a cultural icon (see Culture), and the presence of "''ces malheureuses filles étrangères''" (these poor foreign girls) on the streets of France, who he depicted as the security threat. By "rescuing" these victims of trafficking and returning them home, he proposed to solve the situation. He argued that the only way to achieve this was to arrest them and then send them back to their families (''Si le racolage est reconnu comme un délit, les forces de l'ordre pourront, parce qu'elles auront commis un délit, ramener ces filles chez elles''), which he stated to be a humanitarian duty "''c'est un devoir, dirai-je, humanitaire que de raccompagner cette personne chez elle''" (I will say it is a humanitarian duty to return such a person to their home).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/seances/s200211/s20021114/s20021114_mono.html Senat SEANCE DU 14 NOVEMBRE 2002] Comments of M. N Sarkozy.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Far be it for me to suggest punishing these poor girls: The offense that we are creating must come to their aid ... I hope that these women will have a better future than facing degrading encounters night after night"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In drawing this distinction, Sarkozy made frequent reference to the inability to speak French, constructing the issue as a defense of French. He suggested that this made them vulnerable to exploitation, and that the Police would take them home. This last point became a target of those who believed they were being sent back to the conditions that made them leave in the first place.&lt;ref name=allwood08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=779907&amp;clef=ARC-TRK-G_01|title=Non à la guerre aux prostituées - LeMonde.fr|website=lemonde.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further legislative attempts ===
Changes to trafficking policy in 2003 were more influenced by European and international influence than domestic concerns, but trafficking was finally defined as well as giving victims residence permits in exchange for testimony. Critics doubted the practicality or whether the benefits were equally distributed between the women and the authorities, an expression of the tension between human rights and public security.

In April 2006, Senator [[Nicole Borvo]] ([[French Communist Party|PCF]]) attempted to introduce a private bill to repeal the Sarkozy law, arguing that it had been ineffective, and turned victims into criminals. The framework was very similar to the 2001 Deryck report, depicting prostitution as violence rather than law and order, and seeking punishment of exploiters, but also measures for prevention and support.
&lt;ref name=allwood06/&gt;

==== 2011 Parliamentary Commission ====
In April 2011, a parliamentary commission report ("En finir avec le mythe du plus vieux métier du monde") recommended the adoption of the Swedish approach of criminalizing the purchase of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/pdf/rap-info/i3334.pdf|title=Assemblée Nationale.

April 13 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The social affairs minister, [[Roselyne Bachelot]], supported the proposal, stating, "There is no such thing as freely chosen and consenting prostitution. The sale of sexual acts means women's bodies are made available for men, independently of the wishes of those women." Other support came from [[:fr:Mouvement du nid|Mouvement du Nid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8449541/France-considers-making-prostitution-illegal.html|title=France considers making prostitution illegal|date=14 April 2011|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The French sex worker movement [[:fr:STRASS|STRASS]] has condemned the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110414-prostitutes-clients-sex-trade-jailed-fined-under-proposed-law-france-busquet%20-geoffrey|title=France - Sex clients could be fined, jailed under proposed law|website=France 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proposals to punish customers of prostitution (2011-2016)====
In October and November 2013, French lawmakers began debating a proposal to punish customers of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;« Vers une proposition de loi sanctionnant les clients de prostituées par une contravention », in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 2 octobre 2013, p. 12. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] passed a bill fining customers of prostitutes by 268 votes to 138, with 79 abstaining, which would impose fines of at least €1500 on clients caught paying for sexual relations. Within the National Assembly, most of those who supported the bill were MPs from the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], which dominates the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/04/world/europe/france-prostitution-vote/index.html?hpt=hp_t3 | work=CNN | title=French lower house passes bill to fine prostitutes' clients - CNN.com | date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was passed in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] on December 4, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/commission/spec/lutte_contre_le_systeme_prostitutionnel/index.html|title=Commission spéciale - Lutte contre le système prostitutionnel - Sénat|website=senat.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill caused considerable controversy in France among politicians and intellectuals, some for legalizing prostitution, and others wanting it banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/11/22/sanctionner-les-clients-de-prostituees-qui-est-pour-qui-est-contre_3511571_3224.html|title=Sanctionner les clients de prostituées : qui est pour, qui est contre ?|website=Le Monde.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was opposed by many sex workers, and was rejected by the French Senate in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexworkeurope.org/news/general-news/french-senates-special-comission-rejects-criminalisation-clients|title=French Senate's Special Commission Rejects Criminalisation of Clients|website=sexworkeurope.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, on 6 April 2016, the French National Assembly voted to fine customers of prostitutes €1500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2016/04/06/97001-20160406FILWWW00283-le-parlement-vote-la-penalisation-de-la-prostitution.php Prostitution : la pénalisation des clients définitivement votée au Parlement] 'Le Figaro', accessed 7 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions such as the French lesbian feminist Claudie Lesselier.&lt;ref name=allwood06/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maisondesfemmes.free.fr/rajfire/analyses/prostitution.htm |title=Prostitution et violence contre les femmes |first=Claudie |last=Lesselier |date=2 April 2005 |language=fr |website=Réseau pour l'autonomie des femmes immigrées et réfugiées |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209032021/http://maisondesfemmes.free.fr/rajfire/analyses/prostitution.htm |archivedate=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public opinion ==
CSA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.eu/accueil.asp|title=CSA - Institut d'études marketing et d'opinion|website=www.csa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a polling organization, has carried out several surveys on prostitution in France. A 2002 telephone survey analyzed French attitudes about prostitution. 64% of respondents said that prostitution was "a degrading practice for the image and the dignity of the woman (or the man)". 66% of those questioned favored the re-opening of the ''maisons closes'' (brothels - see Maisons closes, below), 37% wanted the clients to be criminalized, 22% wanted the prostitutes to be criminalized and 33% wanted all forms of prostitution to be illegal. When analyzed and broken down by age and gender, the survey showed that some people gave contradictory answers: For example, some people appeared to favor both the re-opening of the ''maisons'' (brothels) and the interdiction of all forms of prostitution (probably believing that both solutions would work, as the survey showed that most people were dissatisfied with the existing legal situation). Older people and men were more accepting of the idea of having legalized brothels.&lt;ref name=csa02&gt;[http://www.csa-fr.com/dataset/data2002/opi20021023d.htm 2002 Survey results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424091048/http://www.csa-fr.com/dataset/data2002/opi20021023d.htm |date=2009-04-24 }}, CSA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csa03&gt;[http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2003/opi20030129a.htm CSA: Les Français et la réouverture des maisons closes 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603152142/http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2003/opi20030129a.htm |date=2008-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2006 poll, only 14% thought prostitution should be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2006/opi20060419b.htm L'opinion des Français à l'égard de la prostitution CSA avril 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603180134/http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2006/opi20060419b.htm |date=2008-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the seventh anniversary of the introduction of the LSI, Médecins du Monde released a very critical report on the effect of the law, and called for its repeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medecinsdumonde.org/mdm/prostitution18mars/index.html |title=Enquête de Médecins du Monde - auprès des personnes se prostituant |author=Medecins du monde |website=medecinsdumonde.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614161343/http://www.medecinsdumonde.org/mdm/prostitution18mars/index.html |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms and extent of prostitution ==
[[File:AvtivistedesProstitues.JPG|thumb|Prostitute activist in Paris, 2005]]
[[File:Bmc perrache.JPG|thumb|Prostitutes working in vans in [[Lyon]], France]]

Studies from 2003 estimated that about 15,000 - 20,000 women work as prostitutes in France.&lt;ref name=afrik&gt;[http://www.afrik.com/article7276.html De plus en plus de prostituées africaines en France], ''Afrik.com'', 7 May 2004. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, the number of full-time male and female prostitutes was estimated at 20,000 - 30,000, with 80% being foreigners.&lt;ref name=guardian2&gt;{{Cite news

Sex work in France, like other countries takes many forms. These include [[street prostitution]], [[escort services]], bars, and [[apartment prostitution]]. Street prostitution is partly controlled by pimps, while other workers are autonomous prostitutes. In some areas, such as [[Lyon]] or the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris, sex workers use vans (see illustration).&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; The most famous prostitution street in Paris, the ''[[Rue Saint-Denis (Paris)|la Rue Saint-Denis]]'', has been somewhat gentrified in recent years and the prostitutes have been moved further north. Escort services where one hires a woman or man for "entertainment" or companionship, but usually including sex, are less common in France, compared to [[North America]]. In [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, women try to induce men to buy expensive drinks along with sexual acts. Prices are set by the bar owner, and the money is shared between the owner and the prostitute. [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]] [[Peep show|peepshow]]s are well known for practicing such scams. Prostitution in apartments is advertised in adult newspapers and magazines. [[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swingers' clubs]] are places where partner-swapping occurs and sometimes paid prostitutes are in attendance, as well as "amateur" women and couples who get in without paying the flat-rate charge of about 80 to 120 euros that men pay, including food, drink and unlimited sex sessions, with the added twist that these are performed in the open in full view of all the guests.

=== Maisons closes ===
Brothels ([[:fr:maisons closes|''Maisons closes'']]) remain illegal, but operate discreetly and clandestinely. Since their official closure in 1946, there have been periodic calls for their re-opening. In 1990, {{ill|Michèle Barzach|fr}} ([[Rally for the Republic|RPR]]), a former [[Minister of Health (France)|Minister of Health]] (1986-1988), suggested re-opening them in 1990 as a public health measure.&lt;ref name=mazur/&gt; A row erupted in 2002 with the proposal by [[Françoise de Panafieu]] ([[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]), which divided French feminists, with [[Gisèle Halimi]] denouncing it, but [[Élisabeth Badinter]] seeing it as an issue of "the right to dispose freely of one's body".&lt;ref name="jdm0702"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encorefem0702"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/02/gender.france|title=Prostitution row divides French feminists|author=Jon Henley|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 proposal by Chantal Brunel for a return to regulated brothels was opposed by French sex workers (see Politics, above).

Meanwhile, Spain has exploited the difference between the two countries by opening brothels along the French-Spanish border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Spain, the world capital of prostitution?|publisher= [[The Independent|Independent]]|date=Dec 5, 2010|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-the-world-capital-of-prostitution-2151581.html|accessdate=2010-12-05|location=London|first=Alasdair|last=Fotheringham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earnings ===
In 2004, the average earnings of a French prostitute were estimated at €500 a day. For Sub-Saharian prostitutes living in France, it was less, around €200-300. Some barely made €50-150 a week.&lt;ref name=afrik/&gt;

== Prostitution and culture ==
[[File:Au Salon de la rue des Moulins - Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.jpg|thumb|left|''{{Interlanguage link multi|The Salon of the Rue des Moulins|fr|3=Salon de la rue des Moulins}}'', by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], 1894]]

[[Nicolas Sarkozy]] recognized that the traditional sex worker was part of France's national cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=allwood06/&gt; 
Paintings and drawings of ''maisons closes'' (brothels), and prostitution appear frequently in art over the centuries, some of which are shown here. Some of the best known are scenes in brothels produced by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], among others. 
[[Brassaï]] published photographs of brothels in his 1935 book ''Voluptés de Paris''.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;Storyville - Paris Brothel, [[BBC Four]] documentary, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A voluminous illustrated work on the phenomenon is ''Maisons closes. L'histoire, l'art, la littérature, les moeurs'' by [[Romi (author)|Romi]] (Robert Miquet), first published in 1952.

Amongst writers depicting the life of women in prostitution in France are [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Victor Hugo]] (see bibliography).

The [[Museum of Eroticism|Musée de l'Erotisme]] in [[Paris]] devotes one floor to the ''maisons closes''. It exhibits ''[[The Good Old Naughty Days|Polissons et galipettes]]'', a collection of short erotic silent movies that were used to entertain brothel visitors, and copies of ''Le Guide Rose'', a contemporary brothel guide that also carried advertising.&lt;ref name=mp&gt;[http://www.metropoleparis.com/2004/903/904life.html A Nice Mix of Art, History and Sex], ''Metropole Paris'', 16 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 [[BBC Four]] documentary ''[[Storyville (television series)|Storyville]] - Paris Brothel'' describes the ''maisons closes''.

An exhibition about historical Paris brothels took place from November 2009 to January 2010 in an art gallery across the street from the former ''Le Chabanais''.&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sin-city-show-celebrates-the-paris-brothel-that-was-loved-by-cary-grant-1815759.html|title=Sin city: show celebrates the Paris brothel that was loved by Cary Grant|author=Genevieve Roberts|date=6 November 2009|newspaper=The Independent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ivyparisnews.com/2009/12/maisons-closes.html |title=Maisons Closes 1860-1946 |author= |date=2009-12-08 |work=VINGT Paris News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215190656/http://www.ivyparisnews.com/2009/12/maisons-closes.html |archivedate=2009-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in France}}
France is a destination, transit, and a limited source country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Foreign victims from [[Eastern Europe]], [[West Africa|West]] and [[North Africa]], [[Asia]], and the [[Caribbean]] are subjected to sex trafficking. Sex trafficking networks controlled by Nigerians, Bulgarians, [[Romania]]ns, Chinese, and French citizens force women into prostitution through [[debt bondage]], physical force, and psychological coercion, including the invocation of voodoo and drug addiction. The number of children exploited in commercial sex has increased in recent years. Children, primarily from Romania, West and North Africa, and the Middle East, are victims of sex trafficking in France. The government estimates the majority of the 30,000 people in prostitution in France, about 90 percent of whom are foreign, are likely trafficking victims. Trafficking of male victims for sex trafficking has increased. Nigerian trafficking networks use migrant and drug trafficking routes through Libya and Italy to transport girls to France.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=France 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282656.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=28 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks France as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 1]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5015">[[File:Runningroom.png|thumb|right|350px|Implant platforms are circular in nature and generally exhibit a diameter of 3-6 mm, depending on the tooth to be restored. The [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|mesial-distal]] dimension to be filled by the implant-supported crown (upper red line) will generally be considerably greater than the diameter of the implant platform (''bottom center'') and the difference between these two dimensions (orange arrows) is gained in the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|apico-coronal]] distance between the implant platform and the contact points of the two teeth adjacent to the edentulous space (red arrow) being restored by the implant.  It is desirable that a greater proportion of this horizontal change in crown width be achieved in the vertical distance between the implant platform and the gingival margin (gumline) so as to achieve an emergence profile as similar to natural as possible.  The vertical dimension between the implant platform and the gingival margin is termed '''running room'''.]]
In [[dental implant|implant]] [[dentistry]], '''running room''' refers to the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|apico-coronal]] distance between the platform of a [[dental implant]] and the [[gingival margin]].  It is a critical factor in restorative implant dentistry because it is effectively the "vertical distance [available subgingivaly] to make a transition from the smaller diameter prosthetic platform of an implant to the larger cross-sectional cervical shape of the tooth being restored."&lt;ref&gt;Cavallaro Jr. JS, Greenstein G: Prosthodontic complications related to non-optimal dental implant placement. In Froum, editor: ''Dental Implant
Complications: Etiology, Prevention, and Treatment''. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell 2010. page 157&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was coined by Jonathan Zamzok, a Manhattan prosthodontist, in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Zamzok J. &lt;u&gt;Nonsurgical soft tissue sculpting&lt;/u&gt;. ''Alpha Omegan'' 1997;90:65-69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
Adequate running room is necessary to allow the implant-supported [[crown (dentistry)|crown]] to exhibit a tooth-shaped contour despite the smaller diameter and circular nature of implant platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Smith RB, Tarnow DP. &lt;u&gt; Classification of molar extraction sites for immediate dental implant placement: technical note&lt;/u&gt;. ''Int J Oral Maxillofac Impl'' 2013;28:911-916&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|mesial-distal]] dimension of a [[maxillary central incisor]] at the points at which it contacts the adjacent teeth is 8.6&amp;nbsp;mm, and the mean mesial-distal dimension of the same tooth at the [[cementoenamel junction|cementoenamel junction (CEJ)]] is 6.4&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid RC, Woelfel JB. ''Woelfel's Dental Anatomy: its relevance to dentistry'', Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2007 {{ISBN|0781768608}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the implant diameter chosen for the maxillary central incisor is usually around 4-5 mm, but the supragingival tooth contours need to mimic those of the natural tooth is esthetic success is intended.

As the anatomical crown and root tapers towards the apex, the mesial-distal dimension decreases, and so the mean mesial-distal dimension at the marginal crest of bone, which lies approximately 2&amp;nbsp;mm apical to the CEJ, is smaller.  The tooth has the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|apico-coronal]] distance from the marginal crest of bone to the contact point in order to increase from the much narrower mesial-distal dimension to the greater mesial-distal dimension, and this distance is partially subgingival (below the gum line) and partially supragingival (above the gun line).  ''Running room'' refers to this subgingival apico-coronal distance.

In general, it is recommended that implants be given approximately 3mm of running room in compliance with the [[rule of thumb]] that implants should be placed as deep as necessary and as shallow as possible.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Greenstein G, Cavallaro J. &lt;u&gt;The relationship between biologic concepts and fabrication of surgical guides for dental implant placement&lt;/u&gt;.

When implants are placed too [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|palatally]] or [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|lingually]] due to aberrant anatomical landmarks, bone resorption or surgical error, it is wise to place the implant more [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|apically]] to increase the available running room in order to allow for a more convex emergence profile and avoid a [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|buccal]] ridge-lap of the prosthetic crown in [[fixed partial denture]] cases.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

'''The Flying Samaritans''' is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to providing free health care for underserved populations in [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]].  The organization consists of ten different chapters, each with up to eight branches, that all operate a medical clinic in Baja California.  Volunteer students, doctors, nurses, pilots, and other health professionals travel with their Flying Samaritans branch to their respective clinic locations and run anywhere from one-day to weekend long clinics on a monthly basis.  Now with more than 1500 members the Flying Samaritans mission has spread broadly across [[California]], [[Arizona]], and Baja California.

The Flying Samaritans' organization has four main principles: to provide primary care, specialty care, education, and emergency care.  Each branch operates slightly differently, however, all strive to attain the same goal in improving healthcare outcomes for the underserved populations of Baja California.  To enliven the first tenant of their mission each branch provides quality primary care to those populations that would otherwise have none.  Most of the Flying Samaritans clinics are located in areas in which medical services are sparse, and therefore primary care through their clinic is essential.  Those branches that do provide specialty care, such as surgery, operate in areas in which follow up is provided to ensure quality services are implemented.  In order to attain educational outcomes the Flying Samaritans' branches work both to educate their volunteers, who in many instances are pre-health professionals, but also to educate their populations in order to provide more preventative and sustainable care. Some branches work specifically with pasantes who are first-year Mexican medical students that must fulfill a one-year government requirement in order to graduate medical school. Finally, emergency care is provided through disaster relief and other critical medical needs at various clinic locations.&lt;ref name="The Flying Samaritans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingsamaritans.net |title=The Flying Samaritans |publisher=The Flying Samaritans |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"&gt;"Sue Roberts: 'Flying Samaritan' to Mexico's Rural Poor."

== History ==
On November 16, 1961, a group of six passengers, and a pilot by the name of Aileen Saunders, took off from La Paz, Baja California, Mexico. Headed for San Diego, the crew was forced to stop short when they unexpectedly encountered adverse weather along their course.  After a stop in Bahia de Los Angeles, Aileen hit dust storms preventing her from landing in Tijuana or San Diego.  She decided to land in Ensenada for the time being, but within three minutes of landing she suddenly could not see the ground as well as the 5,000 to 7,000 foot peaks in the area.  Forced to circle the area avoiding the peaks, they eventually flew over the storm, and decided to land on a strip outside of the El Rosario community.  In El Rosario the general store's proprietor, Anita Espinosa, acted as a translator for the group while giving them accommodations and hot chocolate.  Anita told the travelers about the village's recent devastation from flooding, and the somber spirits in the community.  She told them that the people would be grateful for clothing donations, and also mentioned the poor health of many community members.

Returning to San Diego, Aileen and the two other pilot passengers, Leah Hanlon and Polly Ross, began collecting donations.  They returned to El Rosario the Saturday prior to that year's Christmas carrying with them a surplus of clothing, food, and toys.  On the excursion was also a doctor who brought with him his medical bag.  Upon arriving in the community the doctor was mobbed by sick villagers, and so was born the Flying Samaritans, originally named by the people of El Rosario the Flying Angels.  This same doctor not long after returned with nurses and other medical professionals, making trips every other week to provide the community with much needed medical care.  They first operated out of the virtually abandoned local hospital, Hospital Civil de El Rosario, and worked to turn it into a facility they could use to treat patients.

Expanding to over 20 clinic locations in more than 50 years, now the Flying Samaritans has grown to serve many populations like El Rosario across Baja California, Mexico. With the many additional chapters and branches in California, Arizona, and Baja California the organization now consists of a much larger population that provides the same quality healthcare by motor vehicle.  Each branch is made up of a unique group of leaders and volunteers that travel to their respective clinics operating under the same mission founded by the original Flying Angels.&lt;ref name="The Flying Samaritans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="advanceweb1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="armchair1997"&gt;Spira, A.

==== Colonia Margarita Moran: The Flying Samaritans at UCLA ====
[[File:Flying Samaritans at UCLA.jpg|thumb|http://www.flyingsamaritansatucla.org]]
The Flying Samaritans at UCLA was founded in 2012 by Rebecca Barber and Lyolya Hovhannisyan, two undergraduate pre-health students. This Flying Samaritans clinic operates in Colonia Margarita Moran, Mexico every third Saturday of the month. It is roughly a three-hour drive from Los Angeles just east of the Otay Mesa border crossing. Also an organization at UCLA with over 200 members, the UCLA Flying Samaritans branch has grown rapidly since its formation.  The Flying Samaritans at UCLA strives to provide its community with more than just immediate health care.  They have devoted additional resources towards improving the overall quality of life for the community, and have conducted community needs assessments in order to better understand how to help the people of Colonia Margarita Moran.  With the $10,000 scholarship Lyolya and Rebecca received in 2012 from the Donald A. Strauss Foundation they have been able to implement even more comprehensive health education projects at their clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straussfoundation.org |title=Strauss Home Page |publisher=Straussfoundation.org |date=2014-04-29 |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each month Flying Sams at UCLA travels to their clinic in the community and provides roughly 30 patients with free medical care, as well as, provides educational seminars for adults and children about health topics such as diabetes, cholesterol, hygiene, and exercise.  The Flying Samaritans at UCLA has a goal to improve the lives of the people in Colonia Margarita Moran by working directly with community leaders and members to address more than just their health needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingsamaritansatucla.org |title=Home |publisher=Flyingsamaritansatucla.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, R.

==== Chapultepec: The Flying Samaritans at UCSD ====

In 1999 the Flying Samaritans at UCSD was founded, but it was not until 2001 after much negotiation with the Mexican government that their clinic in Chapultepec, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico officially opened.  They operate their clinic in a Centro de Desarollo owned by the Mexican Family Health Department (DIF). Raj Chudassama, Lori Lamb, and Ritesh Bhayani founded the UCSD Flying Samaritans clinic.  In 2012 President Anelah McGuiness won the Donald A. Strauss Scholarship giving her $10,000 to create a dental clinic for their Flying Samaritans branch.  In 2013 they also formed a collaboration with the Rancho El Faro Orphanage in El Porvenir, an orphanage operated by the non-profit organization Corazon De Vida. They have worked on public health projections, given many check-ups, hosted donation drives, and are working to construct a chicken coop at the orphanage.&lt;ref&gt;Autman, S.

Providing primary care to 300 patients a month as well as hearing and eye care to roughly 50 patients a month, this branch has grown rapidly to best serve the roughly 1.5 million residents of Rosarito Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rosarito Beach Chapter |url=http://flyingsamaritansrosarito.org |title=Rosarito Beach Chapter |publisher=Flyingsamaritansrosarito.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Southern California Chapter (Long Beach) ===
The Southern California Chapter of the Flying Samaritans, previously known as the Foothill Chapter, was founded in 1977 by Gordon Gray a retired US Marine pilot. Bill and Boz French founded the first clinic in El Arco, a remote mining village 25 miles east of Guerro Negro. After ten years of servicing the community the mines closed down and most residents left the village and therefore the Flying Samaritans closed their clinic.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, E. "Flying Samaritans Do Good Turns in Baja." ''LA Times''. October 15, 1987. http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-15/local/me-14429_1_flying-samaritans&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus Maria clinic was founded in 1987 as the second clinic within the Southern California Chapter, after the El Arco clinic closed down. They travel on the second Saturday of each month to provide dental and medical services and occasionally optometry and gynecology services.&lt;ref name="armchair1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jesusmariaproject.wordpress.com |title=Jesus Maria Project in Mexico |publisher=Jesusmariaproject.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flyingsamaritans.net/web/sams/orange_county/web/ |title=Flying Samaritans |publisher=Flying Samaritans |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other branches in the Southern California chapter include Bahia De Los Angeles, Hacienda Sinaloa, Santa Ynez, El Niño, and El Testerazo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5239">[[File:Urinating boy with a story.jpg|thumb|upright|A young child sits on a [[potty chair]] as part of being toilet trained.]]
'''Toilet training''', or '''potty training''', is the process of training someone, particularly a young child, to use the [[toilet]] for [[urination]] and [[defecation]], though training may start with a smaller toilet bowl-shaped device (often known as a [[Potty chair|potty]]). Cultural factors play a large part in what age is deemed appropriate, with the expectation for being potty trained ranging from 12 months for some tribes in Africa&lt;ref name="deVries 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=887331|year=1977|last1=Devries|first1=MW|last2=Devries|first2=MR|title=Cultural relativity of toilet training readiness: A perspective from East Africa|volume=60|issue=2|pages=170–7|journal=Pediatrics}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 36 months in the modern United States.&lt;ref name="Blum 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blum NJ, Taubman B, Nemeth N |title=Relationship between age at initiation of toilet training and duration of training: A prospective study|volume= 111|issue=4 Pt 1|pages=810–4|journal=Pediatrics|pmid=12671117|doi=10.1542/peds.111.4.810|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most children can control their [[bowel]] before their [[bladder]], boys typically start and finish later than girls, and it usually takes boys longer to learn to stay dry throughout the night, however it depends on the maturity and consistency of the particular child.&lt;ref name="Schum 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1542/peds.109.3.e48|title=Sequential acquisition of toilet training skills: A descriptive study of gender and age differences in normal children|year=2002|last1=Schum|first1=T.

==Modern practice==
Most people advise that toilet training is a mutual task, requiring cooperation, agreement and understanding between the child and the caregiver, and the best potty training techniques emphasize consistency and [[positive reinforcement]] over [[punishment]] – making it enjoyable for the child.  The vast majority of studies concentrate on children 18 months old and older. In this age range, research suggests that children over 24 months train faster and girls train slightly faster than boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/children/parents/toilet/179.printerview.html Toilet Training Your Child].

=== Accidents ===
Toilet training "accidents" are when a child urinates or defecates in an inappropriate place, such is in their [[Underpants|underwear]] or [[training pants]], or on the floor. Accidents are a normal part of toilet training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/potty-training/when-accidents-happen.aspx|title=Potty Training Accidents {{!}} What to Expect|work=Whattoexpect|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History in the United States ==
Until the mid-1900s, the vast majority of babies finished toilet training by 2 years, and achieved nighttime dryness by 3 years.&lt;ref name="Sears"&gt;Sears, Robert R., Maccoby, Eleanor and Levin, Harry (1957). [https://books.google.com/books?id=JJ-lAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=patterns+child+rearing+sears ''Patterns of Child Rearing'']. pp. 102–137. Evanston IL: Row, Peterson, and Co. &lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the age for toilet training has increased dramatically. The convenience of disposable diapers, pull-up diapers (such as [[Huggies Pull-Ups]] introduced in 1989) and more efficient laundry facilities may contribute to this trend.

In 1957, the average age of starting toilet training was still under the age of one year, 11 months, and 90% of children were dry during the day by 2 years.&lt;ref name="Sears" /&gt;

In 2002, the average age that parents recognized their child "showing an interest in using the potty" was 24–25 months, and daytime dryness was achieved on average at almost 3 years of age.&lt;ref name="Schum 2002" /&gt;  Now nighttime accidents are considered normal until 5 or 6 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724213052/http://www.aap.org/publiced/BR_ToiletTrain.htm Toilet Training]. aap.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morris Fish|Fish J.]] wrote a unanimous verdict for the Court, rejecting Crown contentions that the investigative procedure ought to be withheld from public view, in this case of insalubrious slaughter of cattle at the [[Aylmer Meat Packers]] plant in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/eves-embroiled-in-more-meat-inspection-woes/article20450859/ G+M: "Eves embroiled in more meat inspection woes"], 12 Sep 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yourk|first1=Darren|title=McGuinty moves on tax issue|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mcguinty-moves-on-tax-issue/article25686487/|accessdate=4 March 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|publisher=The Globe and Mail Inc.|date=11 September 2003|quote=The Toronto Star obtained a confidential 2002 cabinet document showing that Agriculture Minister Helen Johns and her staff alerted Mr. Eves that the province's meat-inspection system posed a risk to public health. "By doing nothing, he put lives at risk. He rolled the dice and, again, gambled with people's lives. That's not leadership," Mr. Hampton said at a stop in Toronto. The leaked document states that the "current meat inspection legislation and regulations are outdated." It also recommended an array of improvements, including full-time inspectors, national standards, food-handler training and provincial inspection of meat-processing plants now administered by municipalities, the Star reported. The NDP and Liberals have promised a public inquiry following suspension of the licence of an Aylmer meat-packing plant at the centre of two investigations after it was shut down late last month and meat was seized because of alleged illegal processing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the scandal that ensued had a part in [[Ontario general election, 2003|changing the leadership of the province]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ac2cvGbePlcC Mark Winfield, "Blue-green Province: The Environment and the Political Economy of Ontario"].

A [[justice of the peace]] had issued six search warrants for various locations linked to the Aylmer business.  The investigation by the [[Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources]] and the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] on Sunday 23 August 2003 into the operation of Aylmer became the subject of widespread media reports five days after the execution of the warrants, after the following Wednesday Ontario public safety commissioner Dr. [[James Young (public safety commissioner)|James Young]] told consumers not to eat any meat products from the Aylmer slaughterhouse.  The suitability for human consumption of meat slaughtered and processed by Aylmer became a matter of public concern.  The company was investigated for "possible offences involving the illegal processing of [[livestock|deadstock]]."&lt;ref name=cl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/police-launch-investigation-into-aylmer-meat-packers-1.409535 cbc.ca: "Police launch investigation into Aylmer Meat Packers"], 28 Aug 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031001034748/http://www.cbc.ca/news/indepth/background/madcow_meatsafety.html cbc.ca: "Meat safety: Is it safe to eat Canadian beef?"], 28 Aug 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Online records show that, as a result of the tainted meat scandal, company president Butch Clare pleaded guilty to distributing improperly labelled meat and received fines totalling $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/2010/06/16/food-safety-and-common-sense-a-difficult-balancing-act owensoundsuntimes.com: "Food safety and common sense a difficult balancing act"], 16 Jun 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaylmernews.com/?m=201001 theaylmernews.com: "Archive for January 2010"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==

{{cquote|The [[Dagenais v Canadian Broadcasting Corp|Dagenais]]/[[R v Mentuck|Mentuck]] test applies to all discretionary court orders that limit freedom of expression and freedom of the press in relation to legal proceedings, including orders to seal search warrant materials made upon application by the Crown. Court proceedings are presumptively “open” in Canada and public access will be barred only when the appropriate court, in the exercise of its discretion, concludes that disclosure would subvert the ends of justice or unduly impair its proper administration. Though applicable at every stage of the judicial process, the Dagenais/Mentuck test must be applied in a flexible and contextual manner, and regard must be had to the circumstances in which a sealing order is sought by the Crown, or by others with a real and demonstrated interest in delaying public disclosure.&lt;ref name=cl&gt;[http://canlii.ca/t/1l27q canlii.org: "Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. v. Ontario, [2005] 2 SCR 188, 2005 SCC 41 (CanLII)"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{pb}}In any constitutional climate, the administration of justice thrives on exposure to light — and withers under a cloud of secrecy. ... The issue in this case is whether [the Dagenais/Mentuck] test, developed in the context of publication bans at the time of trial, applies as well at the precharge or “investigative stage” of criminal proceedings. More particularly, whether it applies to “sealing orders” concerning search warrants and the informations upon which their issuance was judicially authorized. ... [T]he Dagenais/Mentuck test applies to all discretionary court orders that limit freedom of expression and freedom of the press in relation to legal proceedings. Any other conclusion appears to me inconsistent with an unbroken line of authority in this Court over the past two decades. And it would tend to undermine the open court principle inextricably incorporated into the core values of s. 2(b) of the Charter... [The Court below] emphasized the importance of freedom of expression and of the press, and noted that applications to intrude on that freedom must be “subject to close scrutiny and meet rigorous standards”}}

USAMRU-B operated under a cooperative agreement with the [[Instituto de Biologia do Exercito]] (IBEX, the “Institute of Biology of the Brazilian Army”). USAMRU-B collaborated on research with IBEX, the [[PAHO]], [[University of Espírito Santo]], [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]], and the [[Instituto de Medicine Tropical do Amazonas]] to investigate infectious diseases in the [[Brazilian Amazon]].

Its decommissioning came as the result of political difficulties between US and Brazilian military leadership.

After a number of failed attempts at reopening the Korean market, imports finally resumed in July 2008 leading to the massive [[2008 US beef protest in South Korea]].

==Import ban==
The [[Government of South Korea]] banned imports of U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease was discovered in a cow in Washington.&lt;ref name="Mad Cow Case" /&gt; By 2006, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] would confirm a total of three cases of BSE-infected cattle, two raised domestically, and one imported from Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/bse/ |title=BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or Mad Cow Disease) |access-date=4 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420233230/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/bse/ |archive-date=20 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, South Korea was the third-largest purchaser of US beef exports, with an estimated market value of $815 million. An early attempt to reopen the Korean market in the fall of 2006 failed when the Korean government discovered bone chips in the shipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infarmation.com.au/common/pdf/MLA_20061204.pdf Korea discovers bone chips in U.S. beef]&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic attempts made in the following year also failed for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korea.net/news/News/LangView.asp?serial_no=20070802009&amp;lang_no=1&amp;part=104&amp;SearchDay= Korea suspends quarantine inspection of all U.S. beef]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korea.net/news/News/NewsView.asp?serial_no=20071005016&amp;part=104&amp;SearchDay= Korea halts inspection of U.S. beef imports after bone discovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==

Throughout the ban, domestic beef farmers and local activists opposed re-opening of the market to U.S. claiming that American beef would cause mad cow disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/213049.html Beef farmers full of worry over future]&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lotte Department Store attempted to sell US beef in July 2007 during the [[Roh Moo-hyun]] administration, local activists stormed the meat counters and hurled cow dung at department store workers, abruptly terminating the resumption of sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2878042 Beef sales bring out a storm of protests]&lt;/ref&gt; When President [[Lee Myung-bak]] assumed office in February 2008, it was widely expected that he would relax the ban on US beef as part of the process of ratification for the [[South Korea – United States Free Trade Agreement]] concluded by his predecessor, [[Roh Moo-hyun]]. Lee Myung-bak's attempt to reopen the Korean market to US beef along with protests against the Free Trade Agreement led to the country's largest anti-government protests in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=  Choe | first=  Sang-hun | url= http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/06/11/asia/seoul.php  | title=  Protests in Seoul more about nationalism than beef | publisher=  [[International Herald Tribune]]| date= 11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifting of import ban==
Despite the protests, US beef imports resumed on 1 July 2008.  On 2 July 2008, [[Han Seung-soo]], [[Prime Minister of South Korea]] bought 260,000 [[Korean won|won]] worth of U.S. [[steak]] to eat with his family at his official residence to alleviate public worries about US beef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Willard Myron Allen''' (1904 – 1993) was an American [[gynecologist]]. He was born in 1904 in [[Farmington, New York]], near [[Rochester, New York]]. As an undergraduate student at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] (now Hobart and William Smith Colleges) in Geneva, New York, Allen had studied [[organic chemistry]]. This would come in handy for his medical school research that would reserve a special place for him in the annals of medical history. He graduated from Hobart in 1926, and was awarded an honorary D.Sc. degree in 1940 for his medical discoveries at the [[University of Rochester]].

Allen studied medicine at the University of Rochester and supported himself by working as an assistant in his anatomy professor, [[George W. Corner]]’s embryology laboratory. Corner and Allen are credited with the discovery of ''progestin'', the original name for progesterone and not to be confused with [[progestin]], a synthetic [[progestogen]], in 1930 and the first isolation of [[progesterone]] in 1933 (described below and in W.M. Allen "My Life with Progesterone", 2005 below). He graduated with honors in 1932. After several years of teaching at Rochester, Allen was appointed professor and chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University's School of Medicine in St. Louis. He contributed original papers on the histology and physiology of the female reproductive organs, bringing him many national and international awards. He was the first graduate of the Medical School in Rochester to be elected to that university's board of trustees.

When Allen joined Washington University in 1940, he was the youngest chairman of a clinical department. He served as chairman for thirty years until his retirement from Washington University to accept the position of Dean of Admissions at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.

'''Co-Discoverer who named the universal pregnancy maintaining hormone progesterone.''' &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Considerable space has been devoted to the world-changing, female hormone progesterone. But little has been written about its remarkable discoverer, Willard M. Allen.

The day Allen isolated pure ''progestin'' (later named by him ''progesterone'') was a very significant day in his life.

"... The isolation of the hormone from the waxy material obtained by high-vacuum distillation was a laborious and exasperating experience. However, the month of May 1933 was a glorious month. On May 5, I had the crystalline corpus luteum hormone. On May 18, my daughter, Lucille, was born. My friends gave me double congratulations and I was sitting on top of the world. ..."&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
